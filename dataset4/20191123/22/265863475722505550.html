      <p><i>The Hills: New Beginnings</i> star has been put through the wringer the past few months when it comes to romance. Now she is using her heartbreak to impart some words of wisdom to those who may be going through similar situations.</p>
      <p>“I was not OK or thriving AT ALL for a while/ For me staying busy did help and at the end of the day, I still had to work/attend events so I had to keep it moving on social media but when I was alone I was very sad and in my head about all of it. As I’ve said before, there’s really no way around it. You just have to go through it,” the began in a message via Instagram Stories.</p>

      <p>Carter split from Jenner over the summer, nearly one year after their Indonesian wedding. The couple never made the union legal in the United States, but they were together for nearly five years.</p>
      <p>She then embarked on a whirlwind romance with Miley Cyrus who had just ended her eight-month marriage to Liam Hemsworth. The two ladies even lived together for a while during their almost two months as a couple.</p>
      <p>One piece of advice she shared is to not start dating immediately after a split.</p>
      <p>“NOT TRYING TO DATE. I know that dating before I’m ready would’ve made things so much worse cause I would’ve just been trying to replace someone else and ended up disappointed. I think it’s sooooo key to take as much time as you can to get comfortable completely on your own so that when you do date someone new you’re not dragging baggage into that relationship and also you aren’t compromising on what you want out of loneliness/panic,” she expressed.</p>
