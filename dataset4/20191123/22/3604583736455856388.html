      <p>A woman who was arrested after a traffickable quantity of drugs was allegedly found at her Mount Pleasant home on Tuesday remains in custody.</p>
      <p>Samantha Broes was refused bail at the Ballarat Magistrates Court on Thursday because she failed to show exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p>Police nominal informant Senior Constable Michelle Cosgrave said Broes was already on bail, charged with trafficking drugs in June, when she was arrested on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>She said police searched her home and uncovered 326 grams of cannabis, 30 grams of cocaine, 20 grams of ecstasy, a large amount of capsules, $570 cash and three mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Tristan Merakis, 32, who was at Broes' house during the search warrant, was arrested and charged but was granted bail after he showed compelling reasons.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Cosgrave said police considered Broes an unacceptable risk of re-offending while on bail.</p>
      <p>She said police were concerned about her children, after a large quantity of cannabis was located in Broes' washing machine.</p>
      <p>The court was told Broes refused to be interviewed by police and told them she "uses ice to get by".</p>
      <p>Police did not consider Merakis, of Ballarat East, an unacceptable risk of re-offending while he was willing to engage in the Court Integrated Services Program.</p>
      <p>He was bailed with conditions, while Broes was remanded in custody. The pair will reappear at the Ballarat Magistrates Court for a mention on December 16.</p>
      <p>They have each been charged with eight trafficking and possessing drug offences.</p>
