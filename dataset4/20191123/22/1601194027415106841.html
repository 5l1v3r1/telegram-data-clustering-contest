      <h4>What's the rumor?</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> are currently without the injured duo of Eric Gordon and Danuel House, and Mike D'Antoni's team has notably lacked depth over the past few seasons. Nevertheless, <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403536/2019/11/23/bullets-after-the-buzzer-rockets-late-collapse-shrouded-in-coaching-controversy/?source=shared-article">Kelly Iko of The Athletic</a> is reporting that the Rockets are unlikely to offer <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/j-r-smith-2">J.R. Smith</a> a route back into the NBA:</p>
      <blockquote>Concerning the injuries to Houston’s snipers, Rockets fans have pointed to the free-agent pool of shooters like J.R. Smith, Jamal Crawford, and Nick Young - names I brought up in conversation - but there’s no urgent sense of desperation to go that route.</blockquote>
      <h4>In case you didn't know...</h4>
      <p>Smith played just 11 games for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season after publicly criticizing the direction of the team while also outlining his <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/25146296/jr-smith-wants-trade-cleveland-cavaliers">desire for a trade</a>. Smith failed to secure a move ahead of the trade deadline and was subsequently waived by the Cavs earlier this summer.</p>
      <p>While his stock has fallen considerably over the past 12 months, Smith is just one season removed from starting on a Cleveland team that reached the 2018 NBA Finals. The veteran was also a reliable performer during his first four seasons with the Cavaliers as he averaged 9.9 points and 2.9 rebounds in 29.3 minutes per game.</p>
      <h4>The heart of the matter</h4>
      <p>Smith only recently turned 34, and despite a year away from the league, the former Knicks man should have at least a season of good basketball left in him. While a move to the Rockets appears to have been ruled out, Smith could still make an impact on a contending team that needs to add experience and depth to the bench.</p>
      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>Following their narrow defeat to the LA Clippers on Friday night, the Rockets will be back in action tomorrow evening as they take on the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
