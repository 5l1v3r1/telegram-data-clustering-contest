      <p>BENGALURU: Congress general secretary KC Venugopal on Saturday said that all 44 MLAs of his party in Maharashtra are united, while accused Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari of bypassing all norms and regulations.</p>
      <p>"Our 44 MLAs are intact. The Maharashtra Governor has bypassed all norms and regulations. Without any verification, he invited the BJP to form the government. We have moved the Supreme Court. We will also raise this issue in Parliament," Venugopal told media persons.<br/><br/><b>ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/nov/23/sena-ncp-congress-seek-sc-intervention-demand-quashing-of-maharashtra-governors-decision-2066114.html">Sena-NCP-Congress seek SC intervention, demand quashing of Maharashtra Governor's decision</a></b></p>

      <p>Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress have filed a joint petition in the Supreme Court against the decision of the Maharashtra Governor inviting Devendra Fadnavis to form the government on November 23, seeking urgent hearing tonight itself. </p>
