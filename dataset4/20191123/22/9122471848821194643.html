      <h1>Urban Meyer Reacts To Ohio State’s Win vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:35:14+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>With its win against Penn State today, Ohio State locked up the Big Ten East, and a spot in the conference championship game. After the FOX broadcast, former Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer was very complimentary of the team.</p>
      <p>Ohio State went up early, leading 21-0 a few minutes into the third quarter. Things took a stark turn for a bit, when Ohio State couldn’t stop fumbling it away to the Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>Penn State cut things to 21-17 and had Ohio State on its heels. The Buckeyes answered though, with a beautiful Justin Fields-to-Chris Olave touchdown pass to seal things at 28-17.</p>
      <p>During FOX’s postgame show, Meyer said he was impressed with how the team responded when Penn State started to gain momentum. Via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Urban-Meyer-reacts-to-Ohio-State-Buckeyes-win-over-Penn-State-Nittany-Lions-139070967/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I thought (the adversity) was handled great,” Meyer said. “I know you’re going to have people say that wasn’t a pretty game. That’s utterly ridiculous. That’s two top-10 teams. They won the division, arguably the best division in all of college football. Now they’re (preparing) for the showdown against their rival. But enjoy the win. I thought they played great. Give that team in the white credit as well. “</blockquote>
      <p>Chase Young played a huge part in Ohio State figuring things out in that fourth quarter. The superstar defensive end, in his first game back from a two-game suspension, had some huge sacks on PSU quarterback Will Levis, who had been bringing the team back.</p>
      <p>The game has reignited some of the <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/chase-young-heisman-trophy-hype-increasing-vs-penn-state">Chase Young Heisman talk</a>, and Meyer thinks he should be the major competition for LSU quarterback Joe Burrow.</p>
      <blockquote>“You think about Wisconsin, you think about this one,” Meyer said. “I think if he does the same thing next week, he has to go to New York. Has to go if it’s the best player in college. That’s Penn State and Wisconsin. If he does it next week, something should happen. … Joe Burrow and Chase Young.”</blockquote>
      <p>Young may be the best player in the sport right now, and defensive stars deserve more attention when Heisman season rolls around, so I’m definitely with Urban Meyer here, even if he’d probably admit he’s a bit biased toward his former player.</p>
      <p>Ohio State faces Michigan next weekend in Ann Arbor. Another multi-sack game, and hopefully Young can keep building that resume.</p>
