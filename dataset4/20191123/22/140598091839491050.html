      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has challenged Fred to fill the troublesome void left by ankle injuries to his first choice midfielders Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay ahead of a critical run of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Pogba is not expected back until mid-December at the earliest while McTominay could miss Jose Mourinho’s return to Old Trafford with Tottenham Hotspur and the Manchester derby early next month in addition to<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/sheffield-united-vs-manchester-united-premier-league-time-kick/"> Sunday's trip to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United</a> and the visit of Aston Villa a week later.</p>
      <p>Nemanja Matic has also only just returned to full training after a near seven week lay-off and the situation leaves Solskjaer chronically short of quality options in midfield.</p>
      <p>But the United manager has been encouraged <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/21/fred-insists-has-settled-manchester-rare-united-start-confident/">by Fred’s marked improvement </a>in recent weeks after a torrid transition to English football and believes the Brazil midfielder is slowly starting to show why the club paid Shakhtar Donetsk £52 million for him last year.</p>
      <p>“First of all, the price tag, that is none of Fred’s concern, and it shouldn’t be because that is just how football has gone,” Solskjaer said. “The prices nowadays, you think, ‘Hmm’ but the market today is different to what it was. That shouldn’t be on Fred, that should be on us.</p>

      <p>“Fred came in, he did well to start with. Then he hit a difficult period. Then when I came in, he found it hard, then he had a very good period. And now he is having a very good period again. He is showing what we saw in him.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer believes the adjustment to the Premier League was always going to be difficult for Fred but that his improving grasp of English and summer marriage to partner Monique Salum, with whom he had a baby, Benjamin, earlier in the year, have been significant factors in him finally settling at United. </p>
      <p>“He is more confident, he believes in himself,” Solskjaer said. “He has come to a new country, the biggest club in the world, he is learning the language. He is speaking good English now, I don’t have to speak very slowly to him when we talk to him now.</p>
      <p>“You can see him in training he’s happy. He’s married, he has a kid. I think he is finding his feet and enjoying himself.</p>
      <p>“He does have both creativity and tenacity. He is a good ball winner. He reminds me of a Norwegian player called Erik Mykland who I played with. He was unbelievable, he was little but he was so quick.</p>
      <p>“Of course, when it becomes a real fight up in the air, that is not Fred’s game but Fred has shown in the last few games what his strengths are.”</p>
      <p>In that regard, Solskjaer’s side are likely to miss the height of McTominay and Pogba against the aerial threat posed by Sheffield United, who are a point ahead of them.</p>
      <p>But he believes it is time Manchester United raise their game against some of the top flight’s less heralded teams after defeats to Crystal Palace, West Ham, Newcastle and Bournemouth already this term.</p>
      <p>“We’ve put ourselves in a difficult position but then if you look at the games we’ve done well in, we have beaten Chelsea a few times this year, we have beaten Leicester, we have drawn against Arsenal and Liverpool,” Solskjaer said. “So for me we need to improve on games where teams give us a different challenge.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer believes Harry Maguire’s physical strength and leadership will be vital against Chris Wilder’s team as the England centre-half prepares to return to the club where he began his career.</p>

      <p>Maguire has had to work his way to the top and Solskjaer says it has given his £80m defender a different mindset.</p>
      <p>“I came through the back door myself and I like players with a different type of mentality,” Solskjaer said. “I think the academies are great but sometimes you see a different type of player coming through the other route.</p>
      <p>“One of the dangers with the academies is everything is there for them. Do we prepare them for this man’s game? Sometimes when you are in the academy, the coaches put this session on and you didn’t do well so it is the coach’s fault and it’s the club’s fault.</p>
      <p>“Harry has come in and been different class on and off the pitch, as a leader but also as a good person. You can see players enjoy being in his company, they look up to him, not just because of his size but also the type of lad he is.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has been similarly impressed by another of his summer recruits, winger Daniel James who, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, is beginning to form a threatening front three.</p>
      <p>“He is probably the best defensive winger in the world with his honesty, commitment and the way he does his recovery runs and doing his back tackles,” Solskjaer said. “It is unbelievable, but that is also the base for his attacking football because it gives him the space to run into. He is only going to improve by the coaching and the exposure he gets at Old Trafford because when you are not fazed by being a Manchester United player then the limit must be sky high.”</p>
