      <h1>St Mirren boss Jim Goodwin feared backlash from fans before late Ross County winner</h1>
      <h2>It was a crucial three points that helped lift the Buddies off bottom spot into 10th place.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:10:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>St Mirren boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Jim Goodwin</a> feared a backlash from fans if his side hadn't found a late winner against Ross County.</p>
      <p>The Buddies went behind in the first half as Brian Graham opened the scoring for the Staggies, before a Sean McLoughlin equaliser and a dramatic Sam Foley winner turned it around for the Paisley side.</p>
      <p>It was a crucial three points that helped lift <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> off bottom spot of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> into 10th place and Goodwin hailed his players' resilience.</p>
      <p>But he conceded that he was worried supporters would have turned against them if it wasn't for Foley's late goal.</p>

      <p>He said: "I'm a happy man - I am always happy when we win. I am a wee bit frustrated because I think it could have been a bit more comfortable. But I am delighted for the players because they showed some tremendous character after going a goal down.</p>
      <p>"We really pushed hard in that second half and what a goal it was to win it. I just think we can make life less edgy for us. But a draw wouldn't have been enough for us today.</p>
      <p>"We had to go and win that game and that's what we did. The equaliser came at a good time and it changed my team talk. But we camped ourselves in their half in the second half and I don't think the County boys will have too many complaints about the final</p>
      <p>"We were probably about five minutes away from being booed off the park so we got a nice ovation in the end. Sam will get all the plaudits but the changes we made all had an impact.</p>

      <p>"Tony Andreu and Kyle McAllister both did well. We got into some great positions and we didn't work the goalkeeper. That's definitely something we need to sort out."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-county-fc">Ross County</a> were left frustrated at an eighth league match in a row without a win. Co-manager Steven Ferguson admitted they did not deserve to take anything from the game.</p>
      <p>He added: "It's really disappointing from our point of view. I am not going to sit here and say we deserved anything from the game following that second-half performance.</p>
      <p>"We just keep shooting ourselves in the foot because we are not doing things properly. We didn't do nearly enough in the second half and that's a massive frustration from our point of view."</p>
