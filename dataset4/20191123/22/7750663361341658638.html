      <h1>Roy Hodgson admits concern over Joel Ward injury</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-hodgson/"><b>Roy Hodgson</b></a> has admitted that he is "worried" about the knee injury sustained by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joel-ward/"><b>Joel Ward</b></a> during this afternoon's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">2-1 defeat</a> to Liverpool at Selhurst Park.</h2>

      <p>Ward passed a late fitness test to start the match after overcoming a groin injury he picked up before the international break, but he was forced off again with 20 minutes remaining against the league leaders following a collision with a Liverpool player.</p>
      <p>Hodgson was unsure as to the extent of the injury, but admitted that his side could not afford to lose the defender for a lengthy period.</p>
      <p>"I'm worried because it was a knee-to-knee clash near the touchline. I can't enlighten you for obvious reasons. He has to be assessed, and that probably won't take place until Monday now. He'll be having a total examination of the knee injury he's got and then we'll find out the extent of it," he told reporters at his post-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"If it's going to be an injury which takes a period of time it's something we can ill-afford as that's an area of the squad where we don't have as much back-up as we do for example in the midfield area, where we have quite a lot of players fighting for a place.</p>
      <p>"In fact today we weren't planning to replace Joel Ward, we were planning to give <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-mccarthy/"><b>James McCarthy</b></a> his chance to come on alongside [Jeffrey] Schlupp and replace our two unbelievably hard-working midfield players either side of Luka [Milivojevic], but that had to be cancelled when Joel went down and Martin [Kelly] had to be a substitute for him."</p>
      <p>Palace have now picked up just one point from their last five games, leaving them <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">13th in the Premier League table</a>.</p>
