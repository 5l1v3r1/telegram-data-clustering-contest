      <p>REAL MADRID KEPT pace with Barcelona at the summit of LaLiga after coming from behind to beat Real Sociedad 3-1 at Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Barca had edged past Leganes earlier in the day to open up a three-point lead over their bitter rivals but Zinedine Zidane’s side registered a second consecutive league win to rejoin them on 28 points.</p>
      <p>Willian Jose took advantage of a woeful mistake by Sergio Ramos to put Sociedad ahead in the second minute but Karim Benzema restored parity before half-time.</p>
      <p>Federico Valverde – who opened his Madrid account in the 4-0 win over Eibar before the international break – completed the turnaround shortly after the restart before Luka Modric sealed all three points 16 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Gareth Bale was introduced as a second-half substitute by Zidane and was greeted by a mixture of whistles and cheers from Madrid supporters after holding a banner following Wales’ win over Hungary in midweek that read: ‘WALES. GOLF. MADRID…IN THAT ORDER’.</p>
      <p>Sociedad were gifted the lead inside the opening two minutes thanks to a moment of madness from Ramos.</p>
      <p>The Madrid captain’s backpass to Thibaut Courtois was cut out by Willian Jose, who took a touch past the Belgium international and rolled into an empty net.</p>
      <p>Alex Remiro got down well to keep out Ferland Mendy’s powerful drive soon after, while at the other end Courtois had to beat away Madrid loanee Martin Odegaard’s fierce effort.</p>
      <p>Madrid conjured up a scarcely deserved leveller eight minutes before the interval when Benzema used his chest to steer home Luka Modric’s free-kick from six yards.</p>
      <p>They started the second half with a spring in their step and forged ahead in the 47th minute when Valverde’s shot from just outside the penalty area took a wicked deflection off Mikel Oyarzabal to wrongfoot Remiro.</p>

      <p>Bale shrugged off his hostile reception to play a part in Madrid’s third. His cross from the right was headed down into Modric’s path by Benzema and the Croatian lashed a fine half-volley past Remiro to add gloss to the scoreline.</p>
