      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - After cruising through the first 10 games against teams that didn't put up much a fight, No. 2 Ohio State found itself in a slugfest with No. 9 Penn State.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes responded, winning with defense.</p>
      <p>Justin Hillard intercepted Penn State backup Will Levis' pass and the Buckeyes stopped the Nittany Lions on fourth down on two late drives to seal a 28-17 victory and lock up the Big Ten East title.</p>
      <p>J.K. Dobbins rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns, and Justin Fields threw for 188 yards and two scores for Ohio State (10-0, 8-0).</p>
      <p>Ohio State held on after Penn State (9-2, 7-2) took advantage of two second-half turnovers to climb back in the game after trailing 21-0. This was a far different scenario for Ohio State, which hadn't yet had to play hard into the second half.</p>
      <p>"We talked about going into a big heavyweight match, and you have to take shots," Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. "One of the things about playing in a game like this is you have to be willing to take punches and you have to not flinch when it happens. That was a great example. That was the first time we really were taking shots there."</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes were clinging to a 21-17 lead early in the fourth quarter when Fields threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave to create some breathing room.</p>
      <p>Ohio State, with Chase Young back from a two-game suspension, then got the interception from Hillard before shutting down two late Penn State drives on fourth down, aided by deafening crowd noise. The last drive included back-to-back sacks of backup quarterback Will Levis by Young and linebacker Baron Browning.</p>
      <p>FIELDS FIGHTS BACK</p>
      <p>Fields fumbled away the ball twice, once as he was crossing the goal line for what would have been a touchdown. But he got critical yards on the ground, rushing for 68 yards on 21 carries and threw beautiful second half touchdown passes to K.J. Hill and Olave.</p>
      <p>And he got knocked around plenty, and at one point late in the game was slow to get up after being sacked but stayed in the game.</p>
      <p>"He's a warrior, I'm telling you," Day said. "He's got the heart of a lion."</p>
      <p>CHASE RETURNS</p>
      <p>Young was back in action after sitting out two games as a penalty for breaking the rules by accepting a personal loan. And he was a force, picking up nine tackles, including three sacks. He has 16 1/2 for the season, the most ever by a Buckeye.</p>
      <p>CLIFFORD OUT</p>
      <p>Freshman QB Levis finished up Penn State's first scoring drive in the third quarter - capped by an 18-yard touchdown run by Journey Brown - after Sean Clifford left the game with an injury. Coach James Franklin said Clifford was available to come back in but wasn't 100% so he stayed with Levis, who scored on a 1-yard run in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>"I was a little nervous the first couple plays, but then it all went away, and I started having fun and doing my thing," Levis said.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, Levis signed with Penn State after Fields withdrew his commitment to Franklin and chose Georgia in 2018. Fields transferred to Ohio State in January.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>Penn State: Statistically, the Nittany Lions were beaten soundly but managed to hang around until late. Journey Brown ran the ball 11 times for 64 yards.</p>
      <p>"No one flinched," Penn State safety Garrett Taylor said. "We came out and fought hard."</p>
      <p>Ohio State: The Buckeyes outgained the Nittany Lions 417-227 but were stricken by uncharacteristic turnovers. Now it's on to Ann Arbor for the rivalry game against No. 12 Michigan.</p>
      <p>"It's good to have a full game under your belt, especially going into next week," linebacker Pete Werner said.</p>
      <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
      <p>Buckeyes should stay put. Nittany Lions could drop but not much after playing Ohio State tough.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Penn State: Hosts Rutgers next Saturday in season finale.</p>
      <p>Ohio State: Winds up the regular season next Saturday with rivalry game against Michigan.</p>
