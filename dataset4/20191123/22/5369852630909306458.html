      <p>INTER MOVED BACK to within a point of Serie A leaders Juventus with a comprehensive 3-0 away win over Torino.</p>
      <p>After kick-off was briefly delayed to allow for water to be swept from the pitch amid heavy rain, Lautaro Martinez scored his eighth goal of the season in the 12th minute.</p>
      <p>Twenty minutes later, Stefan de Vrij’s first strike of 2019-20 had Inter two ahead and Romelu Lukaku scored his 10th Serie A goal of the campaign after the break to wrap up the points.</p>
      <p>In-form Lukaku is the first Inter player to score 10 goals in the first 13 matchdays of a debut Serie A season since Stefano Nyers in 1948-49.</p>
      <p>It was a frustrating start for Torino, who lost influential captain Andrea Belotti to injury and fell behind before they could bring on Simone Zaza as his replacement.</p>
      <p>They were caught out by Matias Vecino’s header which allowed Martinez to race clear and find the bottom corner with a right-footed finish.</p>
      <p>Simone Verdi fired narrowly wide at the other end, but Salvatore Sirigu had to produce an excellent save from Lukaku’s powerful header and Inter doubled their lead from the resulting corner, Cristiano Biraghi’s in-swinging cross from the right tapped in by an unmarked De Vrij at the back post.</p>
      <p>A magnificent stop from Samir Handanovic in first-half stoppage time preserved Inter’s two-goal advantage, the goalkeeper diving to claw away Verdi’s deflected cross.</p>
      <p>The visitors lost Nicolo Barella to an injury of their own and were relieved when Armando Izzo sent a good headed chance off target just after the break.</p>
      <p>Inter made sure of victory after 55 minutes, though, Lukaku’s right-footed effort going through the legs of Bremer and beating Sirigu after he had been found by Marcelo Brozovic.</p>

      <p>Handanovic was at his best once more to tip away Verdi’s free-kick but a home fightback never looked likely in the latter stages.</p>
