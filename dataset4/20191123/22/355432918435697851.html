      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s personal lawyer, elaborated on his "insurance policy" Saturday, tweeting that he has files in his safe "about the Biden Family’s 4 decade monetizing of his office."</p>
      <p>"TRUTH ALERT: The statement I’ve made several times of having an insurance policy, if thrown under bus, is sarcastic &amp; relates to the files in my safe about the Biden Family’s 4 decade monetizing of his office," Giuliani tweeted.</p>
      <p>"If I disappear, it will appear immediately along with my RICO chart," he added.</p>

      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471792-giuliani-threatens-he-has-insurance-if-trump-turns-on-him-in">Earlier in the day</a>, the former New York mayor appeared on Fox News, where he said that he has “insurance” in case Trump decides to throw him under the bus.</p>
      <p>"I’ve seen things written like he’s going to throw me under the bus. When they say that, I say he isn’t, but I have insurance," Giuliani told Fox News's Ed Henry.</p>
