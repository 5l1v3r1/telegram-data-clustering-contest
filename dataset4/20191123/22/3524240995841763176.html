      <p>Footballers in Italy took to the pitch Saturday with a red streak on their cheeks as part of an initiative targeting domestic violence against women.</p>
      <p>The campaign coincides with Monday’s ‘International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women’.</p>
      <p>Italian champions Juventus and Serie A rivals Atalanta kicked off the campaign in the first game of the weekend.</p>
      <p>The ‘Give violence against women the red card’ (#unrossoallaviolenza) initiative is being organised by the Lega Serie A together with Italian humanitarian organisation WeWorld Onlus.</p>
      <p>Players and referees at weekend games will be accompanied onto the pitch by girls and have a red mark smeared on their faces to raise public awareness of violence against women.</p>
      <p>“In every stadium, a banner will be displayed to make people aware that the most important red card to give is the one against violence to women,” the Lega Serie A said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In Italy, 142 women were killed from domestic violence in 2018, according to Italian research institute Eures.</p>
      <p>In the last five years, 538,000 women were the victims of physical or sexual abuse by their partners, according to Italy’s national statistics agency.</p>
