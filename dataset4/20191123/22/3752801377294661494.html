      <h1>Men must stop harming those they should protect, says Plato as City of Cape Town launches task team to tackle violence against women and children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:01:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ntwaagae Seleka</a></address>
      <p>The City of Cape Town is launching a team to tackle violence against women and children, allocating R2m to set up teams in vulnerable communities.</p>
      <p>Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato announced this at Athlone Stadium on Saturday ahead of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children.</p>
      <p>The task team is expected to be launched in January and will comprise professionals, social development experts, religious organisations and community members.</p>
      <p>It will work with the City’s social development department and community structures.</p>
      <p>The scope of its work will be determined according to community dynamics and will include a series of workshops and other interventions. The teaks team will have to submit reports and the progress of the project will be monitored by the mayor’s office.</p>
      <p>"The 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women and Children is a period of reflection and a call to action. Today, we are taking proactive steps to fight the scourge of violence against our women and children.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/from-apathy-to-outrage-the-rise-against-sexist-violence-in-sa-20191119">From apathy to outrage - the rise against sexist violence in SA</a>Eventually, it all became too much. Apathy became transformed into outrage. And little by little, a national campaign for change took hold. For years, the country's awful reputation for the murder and rape of women had gone unchallenged by many of its citizens.</blockquote>
      <p>"The past year's crime statistics show that sexual assault went up by nearly 3% and contact sexual offences increased drastically by 19% when compared to the previous year. Common assault and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm have both increased nearly 2% and 4% respectively.</p>
      <p>"It is clear that urgent proactive interventions are needed," Plato said.</p>
      <p>He said too often, there are stories of men harming those whom they should protect and support.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cycle of abuse must end</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We must cherish our wives, mothers, sisters and friends. We must change the behaviour of men so that the cycle of abuse comes to an end," he said.</p>
      <p>During this awareness period, there will also be various activities and drives in community halls in Athlone, Langa, Delft, Wallacedene, Valhalla Park, Table View and others.</p>
      <p>More information about this will be available on the City’s website.</p>
      <p>The task team will assist communities at risk with Women for Change Programme;  men and masculinities programme aimed at both young and adult men to reflect on socialisation to reduce levels of violence in communities and improve relations between men and women; and the City of Cape Town’s Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) and wellness team to maintain their physical and mental health.</p>
