      <p>Barcelona came from behind to snatch a 2-1 victory at La Liga's basement club Leganes on Saturday after another unconvincing display away from home from the champions as substitute Arturo Vidal struck a scrappy late winner.</p>
      <p>MADRID: Barcelona came from behind to snatch a 2-1 victory at La Liga's basement club Leganes on Saturday after another unconvincing display away from home from the champions as substitute Arturo Vidal struck a scrappy late winner.</p>
      <p>Struggling Leganes had taken the lead in coach Javier Aguirre's first home game in charge thanks to a superb strike into the top corner from Morocco forward Youssef En-Nesyri in the 12th minute.</p>

      <p>The home side spurned two chances to extend their advantage before the break but Barca levelled in the 52nd minute when Luis Suarez glanced in Lionel Messi's free kick.</p>
      <p>Barca won the game thanks to a fortunate goal in the 79th minute from Chilean midfielder Vidal, who was in a clear offside position when he knocked in from close range but a VAR review ruled him on as the ball had bounced off Leganes' Ruben Perez.</p>
      <p>Barca extended their lead at the top of the table by three points although second-placed Real Madrid can go level with them when they host Real Sociedad later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Barca face title rivals Atletico Madrid away from home next and will have to do so without influential midfielder Sergio Busquets who is suspended after picking up a fifth yellow card of the campaign.</p>
