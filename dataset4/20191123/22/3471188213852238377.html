      <h1>Optus New Plans 25 Nov: No More Phone Subsidies, Pay off Devices over 12/24/36 Months, 5G Enabled</h1>

      <p>First it was Vodafone, than a few months ago Telstra. Now Optus has also decided to ditch lock-in mobile phone service contracts and radically simplify it’s plan offerings to just a handful of choices.</p>
      <p>Five New Optus postpaid plans including $39/10GB, $79/120GB and $119 Optus One “luxury” will be available on 25th November and offer these features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Month to month</li>
        <li>Build your own plan</li>
        <li>5G ready</li>
        <li>Can buy your device: outright or over 12, 24, or 36 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interestingly Optus is targeting high-end mobile spenders who feel that Telstra’s recent new plans don’t offer them enough value and international data.</p>
      <p>The new Optus One option $119/month will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Network priority</li>
        <li>Dedicated customer service (like an account manager)</li>
        <li>Premium perks yet to be detailed but will include Optus Sport</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the SMH frequent international traveller Optus mobile customers will get to:</p>
      <blockquote>“Pick how much data they want including for roaming, and change this on a monthly basis”</blockquote>
      <p>What do you think of these new Optus plans? Let us know in the comments if you would be willing to switch to them.</p>
