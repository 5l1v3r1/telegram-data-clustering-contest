      <p>Ohio State defensive end Chase Young has taken the college football world by storm. Young is the best player in college football and proves it each and every week.</p>
      <p>After the Buckeyes’ 28-17 victory over Penn State on Saturday afternoon, fans and photographers stormed the field. Who’d they surround?</p>
      <p>Check out this incredible photo of Young after the win.</p>

      <p>Talk about stardom. Young is on top of the college football world right now. Deservedly so.</p>
      <p>After his performance against Penn State on Saturday, people are starting to argue Young <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/chase-young-heisman-trophy-hype-increasing-vs-penn-state">should win this year’s Heisman Trophy</a>. Is there any player as dominant as he is right now?</p>
      <p>LSU QB Joe Burrow is certainly up there. But many feel it’s time for a defensive player to win the award.</p>
      <p>If Young were to win this year’s Heisman Trophy, he’d be the first defensive player to do so since 1997. That season, Michigan’s Charles Woodson took home the coveted award. That’d certainly be something to have a second defensive Heisman Trophy winner come from the Big Ten.</p>
      <p>For Young, he’ll have two more chances to prove to the Heisman voters he’s worthy of the award.</p>
      <p>Ohio State gets back to work next week against Michigan before the Big Ten title game.</p>
