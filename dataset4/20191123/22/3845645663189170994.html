      <p>A 21-year-old Hong Kong student shot by police during street protests called Saturday on voters to come out in force to cast their ballots in weekend elections to “earn more democracy”.</p>
      <p>The semi-autonomous city of 7.5 million votes on Sunday in district-level polls seen as a gauge of the popularity of the pro-Beijing government, which has refused to yield during nearly six months of pro-democracy protests and is accused of failing to stop police brutality.</p>

      <p>“I hope Hong Kong people can cast their votes to earn more democracy in a peaceful way,” Chow Pak-kwan, masked and dressed in the black colours of the city’s pro-democracy movement, told reporters.</p>
      <p>Chow was shot two weeks ago, one of three people hit with live rounds during protests. He is the first of the shooting victims to speak publicly.</p>
      <p>Chow was discharged from hospital on Wednesday after having one of his kidneys and part of his liver removed as a result of his wound.</p>
      <p>Walking with a cane, Chow said he would vote near his home on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“One more vote means a lot and every vote matters,” he said.</p>

      <p>The vocational-school student was shot in the abdomen by a traffic police officer on November 11, when protesters blocked roads across the city to push for a de facto general strike.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t feel any pain the moment I got shot. It felt like being hit by something with great force,” Chow recalled.</p>
      <p>“The strong pain only came after the surgery.”</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s protest movement was sparked by a now-shelved bill to allow extraditions to mainland China, which revived fears that Beijing was restricting the city’s freedoms.</p>
      <p>The movement has widened to include calls for direct elections and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.</p>
      <p>Chow criticised the use of live rounds, saying he suffers from nightmares.</p>

      <p>“I woke up at 2 am, 4 am and 5 am when I was in hospital, from dreams where I saw the officer pointing his gun at me and pulling the trigger,” Chow said.</p>
      <p>Police at first claimed the shooting was justified, alleging that Chow was attempting to snatch the officer’s gun.</p>
      <p>Chow was arrested for unlawful assembly, and on Friday the commissioner of police said he might be charged with other offences following an in-depth investigation.</p>
      <p>But his lawyer Cheng Kar-foo, who was present with Chow on Saturday, said authorities were yet to file charges.</p>
      <p>“A human can be killed by a bullet, but his beliefs can’t,” Chow said.</p>
