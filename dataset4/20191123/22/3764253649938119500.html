      <p><i>“Above all, farmers have led the country to the food self-sufficiency we now enjoy, saving us billions of dollars yearly, which would have been spent on food importation. Such funds are now deployed to other developmental projects, particularly infrastructure,</i>" Buhari said</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Agriculture is one of the veritable ways to economic recovery. It guarantees employment to millions of our people, particularly the youth, engenders better living standards, enhances the income of people, and ensures food security. This, in turn, will improve the security situation in the land.</i>

      <p>Atigwe said that the decision of the federal government will help Nigeria in two vital ways: checkmate the influx of arms into the country and push citizens back to agriculture, The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker stated that leaving Nigerian land borders porous will open the country up for unchecked smuggling, adding that China is where it is now economically because it closed its borders many decades ago.</p>
