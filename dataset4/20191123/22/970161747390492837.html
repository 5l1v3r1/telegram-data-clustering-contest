      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/robbie-williams/">Robbie Williams</a> revealed Elton John forced him into rehab after he turned up at the Rocketman’s home covered in wine stains.</p>
      <p>The Angels hitmaker appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show where he celebrated being sober for 19 years.</p>
      <p>And while discussing his past addiction, the 45-year-old confessed the Honky Cat singer had a hand in getting him to rehab.</p>
      <p>Chatting with the host, Robbie said: ‘He really tried to help. In the early days when I was first getting sober, there was a week until I had to go to rehab and I had two vocals to do on my first album, one of them was Angels and one of them was Let Me Entertain You.</p>
      <p>‘I was going to do these vocals then go to Rehab. Elton invited me to his house to listen to the work that I’d done so far.</p>

      <p>‘That morning I got in a black cab and I had this game that I used to play where I’d stop at every pub I saw and have half a pint.</p>

      <p>‘I’d had ten half pints before I’d got to the studio. I ended up under the mixing desk, had a bit of red wine and then I knew I had to get to Elton’s for three o’clock.’</p>
      <p>The rocker made it to Elton’s house looking worse for wear with wine stains down his shirt.</p>
      <p>And when opening the door, the now 72-year-old told the star that he had to get to rehab, with Robbie agreeing with the icon, saying: ‘I’ve got to go to Rehab now’.</p>

      <p>He confessed this exchange went on for a while at the door before Elont and his husband David Furnish put him up for a night at their home in Windsor.</p>
      <p>‘I wake up but I haven’t opened my eyes and there’s a knock on my shoulder and I look and there’s… Elton and David Furnish and a doctor and a psychiatrist and they are here to take me away.’</p>
      <p>Praising the You Song hitmaker, Robbie continued: ‘Elton is the most loving, generous man you could imagine and he has helped so many people over the years.’</p>
      <p>Elton has also battled addiction, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/29/elton-john-reflects-broken-man-celebrates-29-years-sobriety-10481689/">and recently celebrated 29-years of being sober.</a></p>

      <p>At the time he confessed: ’29 years ago today, I was a broken man. I finally summoned up the courage to say three words that would change my life: “I need help”.</p>
      <p>‘Thank-you to all the selfless people who have helped me on my journey through sobriety. I am eternally grateful.’</p>
