        <b>Long-distance king Eliud Kipchoge and Dalilah Muhammad were the big winners at the World Athletics Awards in Monaco.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eliud Kipchoge has been named the Male Athlete of the Year for the second straight year, while Dalilah Muhammad scooped the female award.</p>
      <p>It was a year to remember for marathon great Kipchoge, who won in London for a fourth time in April with a course-record time.</p>
      <p>Kipchoge then ran a sub two-hour time last month, with the Kenyan clocking a 1:59:40.2 in Vienna.</p>
      <p>“I hope I inspire the human race. I’m just really happy to make history. I hope it was a big inspiration to the next generation,” Kipchoge said at the World Athletics Awards in Monaco on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Olympic champion Muhammad was named Female Athlete of the Year after she won World Championship gold in the 400 metres in Doha having twice broken the world record in 2019.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an amazing year. It’s been a tough year but I’m so thankful. I never imagined ending the year like this,” she said.</p>
