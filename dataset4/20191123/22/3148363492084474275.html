      <p>On Saturday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Representative Adam Smith (D-WA) said that the House is “absolutely” headed towards an impeachment vote by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Host Joy Reid asked, “Do you have a sense that this impeachment inquiry will proceed to an actual impeachment vote by the end of the year?”</p>
      <p>Smith answered, “I think it’s probably the worst kept secret in the world right now, that yes, that is absolutely where we are headed. I don’t know what the Senate will do, but the House is prepared to act very soon.”</p>
