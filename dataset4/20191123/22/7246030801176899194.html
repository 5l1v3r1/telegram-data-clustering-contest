      <h1>Hamas Politburo Chief: Netanyahu Indictment Raises Palestinian Morale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:57:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh told reporters in Rafah on Saturday that “the decision to indict [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu raises the morale of the Palestinian people,” according to a report by <i>Asharq al-Awsat</i>.</p>
      <p>Haniyeh, who made the remarks at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new hospital in the city, said that serious corruption charges against the prime minister were a sign “of more steadfastness” for the Arabs, and added that the indictment would encourage more “resistance, both popular and armed.”</p>
      <p>Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced Thursday that he intended to indict Netanyahu for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes.</p>

      <p>The longest-serving prime minister in the history of the state will now also become the first sitting premier to face criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s opponent, Blue and White faction leader Benny Gantz failed to form a government within the prescribed period of time, as had Netanyahu, and was forced to return the mandate to President Reuven Rivlin last Wednesday night.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The mandate was given to the Speaker of the Knesset on Thursday; if within 21 days an individual MK cannot muster enough support to form a coalition on his or her own, Israel will be sent back to the polls for an unprecedented third national election.</p>
