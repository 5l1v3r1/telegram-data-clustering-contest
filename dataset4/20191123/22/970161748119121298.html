      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> has fired a warning to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title challengers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> and Liverpool that his side ‘are coming’.</p>
      <p>The Blues took the lead against City at the Etihad on Saturday evening when N’Golo Kante finished off a fine pass from Mateo Kovacic.</p>
      <p>However, a deflected effort from Kevin De Bruyne got City back on level terms and a fantastic solo effort from Riyad Mahrez gave Pep Guardiola’s men all three points.</p>
      <p>It was Chelsea’s first defeat in the league since Liverpool beat them at Stamford Bridge in September but they matched City for large portions of the defeat and left the Etihad with 54% possession.</p>
      <p>And, while Lampard admits his team are still in transition, he’s warned those above that his Chelsea side are closing the gap.</p>

      <p>‘We’re coming, that’s how I fee,’ said Lampard.</p>
      <p>‘I think we’re coming to close the gap. I don’t want to shout that too loudly because football is day to day, week to week and you have to show a response now after having such a strong run of wins – it feels like a long time now since we lost a game in the league – we now have to go and straight away get back on it.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like there were big, big parts of that game that showed that we’re coming. We know we’re only four months in, of course this was a team that was strong last year anyway but things have changed. Some of our players were playing in the Championship last year, we know that there’s a transitional feel to it but if we keep on working then we will be coming.’</p>
      <p>Chelsea certainly enjoyed a fair share of the ball at the Etihad but failed to create many chances after falling behind.</p>
      <p>Lampard admits his side lacked quality in the final third but says the fact they got into those areas with such ease was pleasing.</p>
      <p>‘Some big parts were good [but] there were some parts to improve on. That’s why there’s a gap. That’s why there was a gap last year of however many points,’ said Lampard.</p>

      <p>‘That’s what Manchester City and Liverpool have done. It was a tough game obviously but we went toe-to-toe in the main but it was a moment of quality form Mahrez and a deflection on the first goal that was the difference.</p>
      <p>‘There was a lot of detail in the game but the amount of time we got into their final third in the first half and in the second half…we just didn’t have that little bit of quality that we can have, it’s not always not there. Today it wasn’t there. Games like this can be lost in the boxes and today I think it was.’</p>
