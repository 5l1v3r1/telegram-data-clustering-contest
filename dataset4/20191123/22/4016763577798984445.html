      <h1>Young M.A Explains How 50 Cent Inspired Her To Be A Rapper</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:01:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/young-ma">Young M.A</a> just became the first LGBTQ+ rapper to grace the <a href="https://www.out.com/print/2019/11/19/out100-young-ma-herstory-acting-porn">cover of <i>Out</i> magazine</a>, where the 27-year-old spoke about how <a href="https://genius.com/artists/50-cent">50 Cent</a> shaped her aspirations.</p>
      <p>The NYC rapper already started writing rhymes at the age of 10, but it was 2003’s <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/50-cent/Get-rich-or-die-tryin">Get Rich or Die Tryin'</a></i> that inspired her to step into the spotlight. “I was like, ‘Who is this? He is fire. And he from New York?’” she told <i>Out</i>’s Culture and Ent. Director Tre’vell Anderson. “That’s what made me want to be a star. That’s what made me be like, ‘Yo, I want to be a rapper. I don’t want to just write.’”</p>
      <p>Back in 2016, 50 Cent <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/08/50-cent-young-ma/">co-signed</a> the Brooklyn native, calling her “the hottest shit out right now.” He ended up <a href="https://genius.com/a/young-m-a-s-favorite-rapper-50-cent-remixed-her-hit-song-ooouuu">remixing</a> her viral hit <a href="https://genius.com/Young-ma-ooouuu-lyrics">“OOOUUU”</a> later that year.</p>

      <p>To support her dreams, M.A’s mother—who also rapped—bought her a karaoke machine that she “turned into a makeshift recording studio using her closet.” At home, she was raised on an assortment of music. “<a href="https://genius.com/artists/mary-j-blige">Mary J. Blige</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/the-notorious-big">Notorious B.I.G</a>, a little <a href="https://genius.com/artists/sizzla">Sizzla</a>, a little <a href="https://genius.com/artists/glen-washington">Glen Washington</a>, reggae vibes,” she continued. “When we came in the crib, that’s what it was.”</p>
      <p>Her childhood influences ended up shaping the structure of her recent album, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Young-ma/Herstory-in-the-making">Herstory in the Making</a></i>. “When I grew up on music… you had the bonus tracks, you had the intro, you had the outro,” she told the magazine. “It was literally a full body of work. Nowadays people put out like seven songs and call it an album. And if you listen [to mine], every song is different. No song sounds the same.”</p>
      <p>M.A also touched on how the industry pressures artists who go viral. “When you come into this industry, they so used to things being a routine of: drop a hot song, got to come up with another hot song, then come with an album,” she said. “I had to eliminate myself from that pressure, from the people that was just on my ass about this shit, and get back to the reason why I made music, why I was so passionate in my music.”</p>
      <p>Only two other hip-hop artists have been <a href="https://www.out.com/music/2019/11/19/young-ma-first-lgbtq-rapper-cover-out-magazine">featured on the cover of <i>Out</i></a>: <a href="https://genius.com/artists/lil-kim">Lil’ Kim</a> in 1999 and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/nicki-minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> in 2010.</p>
