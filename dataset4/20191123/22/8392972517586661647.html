      <p>James Haskell was made the first camp leader on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here</a>.</p>
      <p>The former rugby union player was selected by the other campmates to sit on the throne in a secret ballot, and he chose to appoint Jacqueline Jossa as his deputy leader.</p>
      <p>After Roman Kemp revealed the results of the ballot and that James had got the most votes (five), he told his other campmates: "Thank you, that’s very kind of you all."</p>

      <p>And Caitlyn Jenner joked back: "You better be good or we’re going to fire you."</p>
      <p>James then replied: "Don’t start with me, you won’t win."</p>
      <p>With Caitlyn adding: "I can’t, you’re the King."</p>
      <p>When James announced he had chosen Jac as his deputy, Caitlyn seemed unhappy.</p>
      <p>"I've learned something about James today," she said. "He's not very loyal."</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the show, the campmates won 12 stars in The Pest Office challenge.</p>
      <p>Each of the celebrities, who had been staying in Main Camp, were told they would have to take a live critter in the mouths and hold it there for 60 seconds.</p>
      <p>After achieving three stars, six stars and nine stars, they were allowed to let one of the celebrities out of the Jungle Jail.</p>
      <p>As a result of the trial going so well, the campmates dined on wallaby hind, naploes, daikon, sugar beet leaves, yellow chanterelles and casimiroa for dessert.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was revealed Ian and Jacqueline would be facing the next Bushtucker Trial, the Crevice of Cruelty, which will be aired during Sunday night's (24.11.19) show.</p>
