      <p>Aston Martin's answer to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a>, Lamborghini Urus, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/cayenne">Porsche Cayenne</a> is here, as the covers have finally come off the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/dbx">Aston Martin DBX</a>. And Aston Martin has wasted no time making the <a href="https://configurator.astonmartin.com/#/">online configurator</a> for its first-ever SUV live, allowing us to explore the options list and build our dream Aston Martin DBX, even if we have no hope of ever affording one.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the launch of Aston Martin's first-ever SUV, the DBX comes with a complimentary '1913 Specification' package that adorns the SUV with unique fender badges, sill plaques, designer keys, ventilated front and rear seats, 16-way electric front seats with memory and a heated steering wheel.</p>

      <p>Other core packages include the Convenience Package that adds a power tailgate with gesture control, park assist, touchpad and Homelink wireless control, while the Indulgence Package adds privacy glass to the rear windows in addition to the aforementioned ventilated front and rear seats and 16-way electric front seats. The DB Elegance Package, on the other hand, adds elegant quilting and perforation, brogue and seats with embroided Aston Martin Wings.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin is also offering <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-dbx-will-satisfy-all-your-luxury-needs">accessory packages to suit different lifestyles</a>. Pet owners can take advantage of the Pet Package, for example, which includes a portable washer, while the Snow Package includes boot warmers. For the exterior, there are 30 standard and 24 Q by Aston Martin colors to choose from. We opted for Q's eye-catching Scorpus Red.</p>
