      <h1>Michael Owen and Alan Shearer set to appear on TV together months after furious Twitter row</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The two former Newcastle players clashed on social media following the release of Owen's autobiography after he admitted he regretted his move to Tyneside</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Richardson</a></address>
      <p>Warring pundits Alan Shearer and Michael Owen are set to go head-to-head in what could prove to be a Boxing Day bust-up.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> United team-mates fell out after Shearer accused Owen of being reluctant to play in the finale to the 2008-09 season when Toon were relegated from the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Owen hit back in his autobiography insisting he was being blamed for then Toon caretaker boss Shearer’s managerial shortcomings.</p>
      <p>A flurry of strongly-worded text messages between the feuding pair followed and the fall-out still hasn’t been repaired.</p>
      <p>But Amazon Prime, who are televising 20 Premier League games in December, are now trying to line up the pair to be studio pundits for the Boxing Day clash between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and Newcastle.</p>

      <p>Bosses are braced for sparks to fly but know it could prove compulsive viewing, with the broadcaster keen to make a big impact during their month in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>An Amazon insider said: “It would be great to have both of them in the studio but we would settle for one being in the studio and the other one alongside the match commentator.”</p>
      <p>While Shearer is a legend at Newcastle after 206 goals in 405 games for his boyhood club, Owen made nowhere near the same impression, only making 79 appearances in four seasons, with a return of 30 goals.</p>

      <p>After linking to a video of Owen explaining to BT Sport how much he hated his time at Newcastle and wanted to retire, Shearer wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "Yes Michael, we thought that also, whilst on £120k a week....."</p>
      <p>Owen responded: "Not sure you are as loyal to Newcastle and you make out mate. I distinctly remember you being inches away from signing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> after Sir Bobby Robson put you on the bench You tried everything to get out."</p>
