      <h1>Political paralysis deepens in Israel as PM Benjamin Netanyahu indicted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/sdick/" target="_blank">Samantha Dick</a></address>
      <p>Israel’s longest-serving prime minister could be at the end of his political career.</p>
      <p>For more than 10 years, Benjamin Netanyahu – once dubbed the ‘king of Israel’ – has governed the Middle Eastern country. But perhaps not for much longer.</p>
      <p>The divisive leader has been <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/22/israeli-leader-corruption-charges/">indicted on serious corruption charges</a>, including bribery, breach of trust and fraud, following a three year investigation, the attorney general announced on Friday (Australian time).</p>
      <h3>What are the allegations?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mr Netanyahu allegedly accepted expensive gifts such as pink champagne and cigars from billionaires such as Australian businessman James Packer in return for political favours.</li>
        <li>He allegedly struck a deal with the owner of Israeli daily newspaper <i>Yedioth Ahronoth</i> to receive favourable media coverage in return for making laws that would slow the growth of competing newspaper <i>Israel Hayom</i>.</li>
        <li>He allegedly promoted regulatory decisions that favoured Israeli telecommunications giant Bezeq in exchange for favourable coverage on <i>Walla!</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has denied all three charges, instead blaming a “witch hunt” by the media.</p>
      <p>He is under no legal obligation to resign, and if the cunning political manoeuvring of his past is any indication to go by, it looks like he won’t go down without a fight.</p>
      <h3>Why is Israel in a political deadlock?</h3>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has failed again and again to form a governing coalition this year, grinding Israel’s parliament to a halt.</p>
      <p>A major reason why he could no longer form government this time is because one of the parties that usually makes up part of his coalition – Avigdor Liberman’s nationalist party, Yisrael Beytenu – suddenly refused to join again.</p>

      <p>Mr Liberman wanted to make a stand against the influence of ultra-religious parties in Mr Netanyahu’s conservative government.</p>
      <p>Chief rival Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White party, is fighting to make a claim for the top job.</p>
      <p>But Mr Gantz is up against a paralysed political system that shows no sign of budging.</p>
      <p>In September, the former military chief went head to head with Mr Netanyahu in a general election but neither won a clear majority under the country’s proportional representation voting system.</p>
      <p>Mr Gantz was then given one month to forge a coalition but still he couldn’t rally enough support.</p>
      <p>He told President Reuven Rivlin on Wednesday night that he had failed after talks broke down with Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party and Avigdor Liberman’s nationalist party, Yisrael Beytenu.</p>
      <p>He has made a point of refusing to join forces with Mr Netanyahu.</p>
      <p>“In the last 28 days, I have turned every stone in an attempt to form a government that leads the State of Israel to a different leadership,” Mr Gantz said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, it was not enough.”</p>
      <p>He blamed his defeat on a “hate campaign” led by Mr Netanyahu.</p>
      <p>While the defeat is bad news for Mr Gantz, Israeli voters are feeling the crunch too.</p>
      <p>If no lawmaker is successful in assembling a 61-seat majority over the next three weeks, voters will be forced to drag themselves to a third round of elections in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Professor Amin Saikal, former director of Australian National University’s Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies, said holding another election might not be the quick fix everyone is hoping for.</p>
      <p>“We’re at a stalemate because neither of the parties seem able to form a coalition government,” Professor Saikal told <i>The New Daily. </i></p>
      <p>“Voters are either going to vote in the same pattern as before, or provide one of the major parties with sufficient basis to form a coalition government.”</p>
      <h3>Why should we care?</h3>
      <p>Despite an ongoing and bloody conflict with Palestinians, especially in Hamas-controlled Gaza, Israel is the Middle East’s most stable democracy. A major breakdown could further rupture peace in the volatile region.</p>
      <p>Ahron Shapiro, a senior policy analyst at the Australia Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, said “the world should care about Israel” because of the Middle East’s “fragile net of dependencies”.</p>

      <p>“If Israel is strong, it creates a balance in that region, and if Israel is perceived as unprepared or weak, it invites war from terror groups or Iran,” Mr Shapiro told <i>The New Daily. </i></p>
      <p>“Israel’s political paralysis risks sending a message to Iran… which has promised to destroy Israel many times… that Israel is not prepared for threats.”</p>
      <p>Iran has <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/09/06/iran-nuclear-research-atomic-bomb/">worried world leaders</a> this year by <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/09/05/iran-uranium-enrichment-2/">rapidly ramping up its nuclear program</a>, including the expansion of uranium production.</p>
      <p>“Over time we should be concerned that Israel’s failure to form a government could have implications,’ Mr Shapiro said.</p>
      <p>“Without a government, you can’t plan well for the future or fund the army properly for future threats.”</p>
