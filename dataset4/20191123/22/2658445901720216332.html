      <p>The convener of #RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore, has filed a fresh suit against the Department of State Services (DSS) over his continued detention despite being granted bail by a Federal High Court in Abuja.</p>
      <p>In the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1409/2019 dated November 20, 2019 was filed before the Federal High Court, Abuja.</p>
      <p>The Director General, DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) are listed as respondents in the suit.</p>
      <p>Sowore, in the suit, accused the respondents of violating his rights by their refusal to release him despite meeting the conditions attached to the bail granted him.</p>

      <p>He also accused the DSS of assaulting him when its personnel came to arrest him in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Sowore argued that the DSS’ failure to disclose the offence he allegedly committed and why he was arrested violated his rights.</p>
      <p>He is therefore praying the court to award N500 million damages in his favour against the respondents as compensation for the violation of his rights.</p>
      <p>Some of the reliefs sought by Sowore are:</p>
      <p>*”A declaration that the detention of the applicant from November 7, 2019 till date in violation of the order for his release made on November 6, 2019 is illegal as it violates his fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Section 35 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and Article 6 of African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (Ratification and Enforcement Act (CAP A10) laws of the federation of Nigeria 2004.</p>
      <p>*”An order of this court compelling the respondents to pay to the applicant the sum of N500,000, 000.00 (five hundred million naira) as general and aggravated damages for the illegal violation of the applicant’s fundamental right to life, dignity of his person, fair hearing, health, freedom of movement and freedom of association.</p>
      <p>*”An order of perpetual injunction restraining the respondents from further violating the applicant’s fundamental rights in any manner whatsoever and however without lawful justification.”</p>
