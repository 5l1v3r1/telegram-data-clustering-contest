      <p>“We, the entire members of the executive of the APC under my watch as ward 1 chairman in Ayetoro-Ekiti have suspended those five persons from our party and consequently recommended their expulsion over their anti-party activities and other related offences against our party, the APC.”</p>
      <p>“The suspension was in consonance with the Article 21(D) V of the party’s constitution which says: “Any member who files an action in court of law against the party or any of its officers on any matter or matters relating to the discharge of the duties of the party without first exhausting the avenue for redress provided in this constitution shall automatically stand expelled from the party on filling such action and no appeal against expulsion as stipulated in the clause shall be entertained until the withdrawal of the action from court by the member.</p>
      <p>“The said members remained suspended as their actions and conduct does not represent the APC blueprint and what the governor of the state, Dr. Kayode Fayemi stands for, those party members mentioned remained suspended because of their incurable anti-party activities.”</p>
