      <h1>Mike Riley expected to hold talks on VAR standards with Arsene Wenger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-morgan/" target="_blank">Tom Morgan</a></address>
      <p>Mike Riley, the referees' chief, is expecting to hold talks on VAR standards in the Premier League with former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, the new chief of global football development at Fifa.</p>
      <p>Wenger was a regular critic of Premier League referees during his time as a manager, and Riley said he has "no doubt" that "opportunities will be taking place" to speak to the Frenchman, who is on a review panel at the International Football Association Board.</p>
      <p>Wenger, 70, was appointed by Fifa earlier this month and is responsible for “overseeing and driving the growth and development of the sport for both men and women around the world”.  His role sees him become a member of the football and technical advisory panels involved in the regular reviews by Ifab, which sets out potential changes to the laws of the game.</p>
      <p>This week Riley, managing director of the Professional Game Match Officials Board, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/mike-riley-says-var-errors-have-made-asks-premier-league-keep/">urged the Premier League to keep faith with his version of video assistant refereeing</a> despite admitting the technology was wrong in overturning four refereeing decisions this season.</p>
      <p>A review by the has acknowledged mistakes by the use of the technology surround over-rulings leading to three penalties.  Riley, the managing director of PGMO, cited the errors as he told media improvements would now be seen surrounding speed, consistency and quality of communication. </p>

      <p>From next month, big screens will explain more detail on decisions. Under the current Ifab protocol, no video clips or stills can be shown in stadiums until the referee has made a decision and direct audio communication from the referee or VAR to fans is also not permitted. The Premier League said it has been meeting fan groups, first-team managers, football directors and club secretaries to discuss ongoing changes.</p>
