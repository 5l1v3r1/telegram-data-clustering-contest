      <p>THE IRISH HOCKEY team discovered their Olympic fate today, as the draw for the Tokyo 2020 Games was made.</p>
      <p>Following a <a href="https://www.the42.ie/ireland-canada-olympic-qualifier-2-4877543-Nov2019/">sensational win over Canada</a> earlier this month, Sean Dancer’s side were put into Pool A, and will come up against the Netherlands, who <a href="https://www.the42.ie/ireland-netherlands-womens-hockey-world-cup-final-4165945-Aug2018/">beat the Irish 6-0 in last year’s World Cup final</a>.</p>
      <p>Germany, India, Great Britain and South Africa were also paired in Ireland’s group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Group B comprises Australia, Spain, Argentina, China, New Zealand and hosts Japan.</p>
      <p>Each team will play each other once, with the sides that finish in the top four of the group qualifying for the quarter-final stage.</p>
      <p>The pairings for the men’s draw were also confirmed, though Ireland won’t be there, having missed out following <a href="https://www.the42.ie/ireland-canada-2-4869678-Oct2019/">a heartbreaking loss to Canada</a> last month.</p>
      <p><b>Men</b><br/><b>Pool A:</b> Australia, Argentina, India, Spain, New Zealand, Japan<br/><b>Pool B:</b> Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, South Africa</p>
      <p><b>Women</b><br/><b>Pool A:</b> Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, India, South Africa<br/><b>Pool B:</b> Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Spain, China, Japan</p>
