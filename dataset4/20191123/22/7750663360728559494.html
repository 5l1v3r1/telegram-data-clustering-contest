      <p>The visitors took the lead from the penalty spot in the 26th minute, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sorba-thomas/"><b>Sorba Thomas</b></a> stroking home.</p>
      <p>Wood doubled their advantage after the break, with Brentford loanee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/justin-shaibu/"><b>Justin Shaibu</b></a> playing in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kabongo-tshimanga/"><b>Kabongo Tshimanga</b></a> and he put away a second.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tyronemarsh/"><b>Tyrone Marsh</b></a> thought he had scored a third for the hosts six minutes later but his effort was ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>Hartlepool, who had <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dave-challinor/"><b>Dave Challinor</b></a> in charge of a home game for the first time, pulled one back in the 70th minute when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-donaldson/"><b>Ryan Donaldson</b></a> teed-up <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicky-featherstone/"><b>Nicky Featherstone</b></a> to slot the ball into the corner.</p>
      <p>Pools levelled from the spot with six minutes remaining after a foul in the box by Marsh, with substitute Gime Toure stepping up to score, but they could not find an unlikely winner.</p>
