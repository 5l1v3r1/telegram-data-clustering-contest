      <p>Rugby ace Levi Davis was forced to hit back at members of the audience on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">The X Factor: Celebrity</a> as they turned on girlband V5.</p>
      <p>At the end of Saturday's (23.11.19) episode, group acts Try Star and V5 found themselves fighting for their places in the competition in the Sing Off.</p>
      <p>After both groups sang their hearts out, V5 were saved while Try Star members <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/x-factor-celebrity-hunk-thom-evans-reveals-hes-on-a-sex-ban/">Thom Evans</a>, Levi Davis and Ben Foden were eliminated at the home stretch.</p>

      <p>Host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/eamonn-holmes/eamonn-holmes-walked-off-show-during-filming/">Dermot O'Leary</a> approached the lads to get their take on the result, which must have been disappointing for them - given the positive reactions their initial performance got from the audience, judges and viewers at home.</p>
      <p>Dermot held the mic to Levi, who could barely be heard over a crescendo of angry boos from the furious crowd.</p>
      <aside>Don't boo 'em, clap 'em! Come on.</aside>
      <p>"It's been amazing. We literally cannot thank you guys enough," Levi said, struggling to speak over all the noise.</p>
      <p>Offering a few kind words to the victors, he added: "V5 are awesome guys, it's been great..."</p>
      <p>Levi then hit back at the audience and called for the boos to stop.</p>

      <p>Trying to placate the angry crowd, which continued to flood the arena with boos, he continued: "We love it. They're great. We've had a great experience. It's been amazing."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the penultimate episode of the series, viewers were baffled by <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/nicole-scherzinger/">Nicole Scherzinger</a>'s voice.</p>

      <p>A number of fans of the show on Twitter thought the former Pussycat Doll <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/celeb-x-factor-fans-baffled-by-judge-nicoles-voice/">sounded completely different to how she normally speaks</a> when she sits on the judging panel.</p>
      <p>Nicole wasn't the only judge to leave viewers scratching their heads, as Simon also caused a stir with his appraisal of actor Vinnie Jones' performance.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The former footballer put on a well and truly explosive semi-final show, shouting (I've Had) The Time Of My Life from the film Dirty Dancing as he pranced around the stage.</p>
      <p>Viewers branded it an "assault" on the ears but Simon spoke positively about the performance - and was so at odds with fans that some <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/celebrity-x-factor-fans-call-for-simon-to-be-banned/">even called for him to be 'banned from TV'</a>.</p>
