      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Man Utd transfer window vow ahead of receiving £100m war-chest</h1>
      <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted he may only do loan deals if he does recruit, rather than splash cash on players who are not top-priority targets.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Bates, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/steve-bates/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are preparing to keep their money banked in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>And boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted he may only do loan deals if he does recruit, rather than splash cash on players who are not top-priority targets.</p>
      <p>Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has admitted United suffered earlier this season when France striker Anthony Martial was sidelined for seven weeks with a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>United won just one of the five Premier League games that Martial missed as the £73million summer sale of fellow striker Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan left them short up top.</p>

      <p>But although United have a hefty £100m January war-chest, it seems they won’t be rushed into making signings with Solskjaer revealing he isn’t interested in short-fix solutions.</p>
      <p>“It is not about ‘X’ amount of money we have to spend – it is about who do we think will be good for the club in the long-term, not just three or four months,” said the United boss.</p>
      <p>“The targets we have are probably not available in January.</p>
      <p>“Not many clubs want to sell players that they would otherwise want to keep in January. Maybe one or two could be a loan deal but that is not a big money thing, it is just to help the team.</p>

      <p>“But we are getting players back to fitness and we are looking at what can be available for us.”</p>
      <p>United have been linked with renewed interest in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> striker Mario Mandzukic, who was a target on deadline day in August.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Croatian is only a stop-gap measure, but it’s believed the experienced star regrets not forcing through a move to Old Trafford after failing to play a single minute for the Italians so far this season.</p>
