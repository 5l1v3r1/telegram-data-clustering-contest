      <h1>RHOP Stars Have Left For Their Cast Trip Without Monique Samuels — Was She Fired For Candiace Dillard Altercation?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:06:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>All of the Real Housewives franchises have one thing in common — cast trips. The vacations are not only something that the stars look forward to but the viewers also enjoy — unfortunately, Monique Samuels is sitting this one out.</p>
      <p>The ladies of the Real Housewives of Potomac (Gizelle Bryant, Robyn Dixon, Karen Huger, Ashley Darby, and Candiace Dillard) have all taken off to Portugal for the cast trip according to the blogs that follow the ladies.</p>
      <p>Monique Samuels did not join which cause rumors to swirl that she has been let go due to her fight with Dillard. It has been rumored that some ladies on the cast have alienated her and even refused to film with her in order to get the mommy blogger fired.</p>
      <p>So did it work? According to Monique, she is still very much a part of RHOP.</p>

      <p>After a fan asked her via Twitter if she was ‘fired and banned from the cast trip,’ Samuels responded: ‘No babe. There are a lot of false truths being posted and I’ve just sat back and watched for weeks now y’all have to be wait patiently until Spring 2020. Of all the stories being posted, I’ve not read one that has it all figured out yet.’</p>
      <p>This comes after Candiace accused <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/rhops-candiace-dillard-accuses-monique-samuels-for-blocking-her-from-singing-the-national-anthem-monique-claps-back-341546/">Monique of using her power to have her friend remove her as the singer</a> of the National Anthem for a sports game.</p>
      <p>The two have been feuding since October when they got into an argument that turned physical. They both have filed complaints against each other for second-degree assault and are due in court on the same day.</p>
      <p>So far, the general public seems to be #teammonique based off of past episodes that displayed Candiace’s behavior. Many fans have commented on Bravo’s social media platforms that if Monique goes — they go with her.</p>
