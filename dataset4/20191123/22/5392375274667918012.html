      <p>Samsung Galaxy S10 gets another Android 10 beta update with additional bugfixes<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> is showing some effort when it comes to finishing the Android 10 update for the Galaxy S10 series. The company already rolled out six beta updates and is now rolling the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-s10-android-10-beta-update-out-with-notable-fixes/">seventh one</a> for devices in the United States and South Korea. The update bears software version <i>G97*U1UEU2ZSKL</i> for the US and <i>G97*NKSU3ZSKL</i> for Samsung’s homeland.</p>
      <p>Just like the previous betas, the new firmware updates come just to fix the remaining bugs. That said, there is a fix for “reset issue of device”, a crash of the home screen, and a hanging issue caused by Wi-Fi connections. At the time of this writing, this update is reaching only the referred markets. However, considering the nature of this update, we believe that Samsung will soon spread it to more regions.</p>

      <p>Besides the aforementioned issues, the update also addresses the camera stabilization problem. Moreover, it fixes an error with Digital Wellbeing and Battery Care showing the wrong info. According to reports, Samsung is looking forward to deploying the Android 10 update as soon as in the next month. Considering how fast Samsung is releasing these betas, we believe that the South-Korean firm will reach this goal.</p>
      <p>As always, you can grab the latest beta from the Settings &gt;&gt; Software update menu on your Galaxy S10 device by tapping the “Download and install” option.</p>
