      <p>Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said his side's 2-1 win at Leganes was "important" after they were forced to come from behind to seal the three points.</p>
      <p>En-Nesyri gave the home side the lead but second-half goals from Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal helped the Blaugrana remain at the top of the league.</p>
      <p>The performance was not great, however, but Valverde bemoaned the conditions and talked up the importance of the win at Butarque.</p>
      <p>"We have to be happy," he said. "I know it was not a brilliant game and we know it was was difficult to play here. Then we concede early... They were playing very deep and it was really difficult. Also because of their hunger, the pitch was really bad, the wind... But I don't want to make excuses. It was difficult because we couldn't play and because they defended well.</p>
      <p>"We've not started well away from home (this season) because we've lost three games ... that hurts. Today wasn't a brilliant game. But, on the other hand, we were losing 1-0, something which has happened a few times this season, and we've come back for the win. We have to focus on the positives and you have to find a way to win on the road."</p>
      <p>Barça return to action on Wednesday when they host Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"I think we're going into that game with good sensations," Valverde added. "We won ... last year we lost here. It's hard to play here because Leganes make it tough to play. They deserve credit. They're in a tight position (at the bottom) and know the importance of every point they have.</p>
      <p>"This was an important and tough test. You have to win at these grounds, it's not easy. You have to know how to play at certain moments. Against Dortmund, it's a completely different challenge."</p>
      <p>Valverde added that he took Busquets off early in the second half because he had been booked.</p>
