      <h1>Celtic win puts the pressure back onto Rangers in title race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/roddy-forsyth/" target="_blank">Roddy Forsyth</a></address>
      <p>The resumption of the Scottish Premiership campaign saw Celtic move three points clear of Rangers – who are in action on Sunday at Hamilton – when they dealt efficiently with Livingston, the only team to beat them in domestic competition this season. A repeat of that feat was never likely at Parkhead once Odsonne Edouard took advantage of a horrible mistake by Ricki Lamie, who dozed off in the 20th minute and allowed the French striker to lob Matija Sarkic for the opener.</p>
      <p>Had Edouard taken his next two chances or had Tom Rogic done better from a Jeremie Frimpong cutback in front of a gaping goal, the issue would have been settled by the interval, but resolution for Neil Lennon’s team was delivered by Scott Brown’s deflected drive and an accomplished double from James Forrest in the second half.​</p>
      <p>“It’s a really comprehensive win, off the back of a two-week break,” Lennon said. “I can’t ask any more of the players. They look fit, powerful and playing with real intent.”​</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Edinburgh sides had mixed fortunes. Hibs, in their first game under Jack Ross, fell behind at home to Liam Polworth’s opener for Motherwell, but struck back through Christian Doidge, Florian Kamberi and Daryl Horgan for a 3-1 win.​</p>
      <p>Hearts, still without a manager, were well beaten by Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, where the veteran Chris Burke netted a double and Eamon Brophy compounded the visitors’ dolour in a 3-0 defeat which cannot have helped Austin MacPhee’s case for being promoted from his stand-in role.​</p>
      <p>St Mirren came off the bottom of the table with a 2-1 win against Ross County in Paisley.​</p>
      <p>Brian Graham’s opener was the first goal St Mirren had conceded at home from open play in the league since 27 April but they were redeemed by Sean McLoughlin’s equaliser just before the interval and Sam Foley scored a precious winner two minutes from full time.​</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Rangers – like Celtic – have a Europa League date on Thursday when they face Feyenoord, under the former Ibrox manager, Dick Advocaat, in Rotterdam. Steven Gerrard and his players are level on points with Young Boys at the top of Group G but have the Swiss side at home in their ­final fixture.​</p>
      <p>A win against Feyenoord would see Rangers join Celtic in the round of 32 and one player who hopes for a repeat of the outcome when the sides first met in September is Sheyi Ojo, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/09/19/sheyi-ojo-strikes-rangers-silencefeyenoordin-europa-league/">scored the only goal of the game </a>with an eye-catching strike. ​</p>

      <p>“It was important for everyone ­because it was the first game in the group,” said Ojo.​</p>
      <p>“So far, we have done really well and if we win against Feyenoord, we should be through. Everyone is looking forward to it.​</p>
      <p>“The European run has been really good. The fact that there are so many games coming thick and fast keeps it exciting and everyone wants to progress to the next stage.”​</p>
      <p>Today’s meeting with Accies is, however, the priority for Gerrard as Rangers attempt to deliver a credible title challenge for the first time since 2011. That task plus European qualification and a collision with Celtic in the Betfred Scottish League Cup final at Hampden Park on December 8 are amongst the highlights of an intense block of fixtures between now and New Year.​</p>
      <p>This midwinter passage takes its toll in injuries and suspensions but Gerrard believes that Rangers are significantly better equipped to deal with such demands than was the case a year ago. “It’s the exact reason why we went for volume of bodies in the summer,” he said.​</p>
      <p>“You have to picture scenarios where you have a run in the League Cup and go to the wire in the Europa League. We knew we could be in a situation where have 10 or 11 games in a six-week period.​</p>
      <p>“So, two things are important – volume and quality – and that’s what we tried to do when we put the squad together. I didn’t want to say last summer that we were the finished article, ­because people will then jump all over you if you have a setback or bump in the road.​</p>
      <p>“So far, we’re doing OK. I need to keep driving everything and make sure the players are focused on the next game.​</p>
      <p>“We were certainly stung by suspensions last year on too many occasions, which we’ve spoken about too many times. Injuries hit us at times, too, but we can’t look for excuses. We have to take responsibility for that.​</p>
      <p>“I have to try and put myself in a situation where we deal with ‘what ifs’ – if we have suspensions and injuries, that we still have decent quality to come in. I’m really happy with where the squad sits right now.”</p>
