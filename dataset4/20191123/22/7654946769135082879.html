      <h1>Maple Leafs’ dysfunction, Devils’ Taylor Hall idea full of intrigue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:49:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">Larry Brooks</a></address>
      <p>Mike Babcock, whose last eight teams in Detroit and Toronto combined to win one playoff series, ultimately lost his job behind the Maple Leafs bench because he refused to coach the roster he was given while instead pining for the one he wanted.</p>
      <p>It is not only clear, but crystal, that team president Brendan Shanahan, the man both behind and in front of the franchise curtain, expects the progressive and largely analytics-driven world view of the organization that has permeated every step of the operation to manifest itself on the ice, as well.</p>
      <p>And why not?</p>
      <p>That is why Shanahan chose to install Kyle Dubas as general manager two summers ago instead of extending Lou Lamoriello’s contract in what amounted to an out-with-the-old and in-with-the-new decree. That is why Dubas, who appears to be philosophical lockstep with Shanahan, could not continue another day with Babcock, who became more than rigid and unyielding in his decision-making, but in fact defiant of the front office.</p>
      <p>Does a leader thumb his nose at his immediate boss and his immediate boss’ boss by refusing to play the team’s most heralded offseason acquisition in the spot where he would create the most impact? Or is what Babcock did by relegating power play point man Tyson Barrie, acquired from Colorado over the summer for coach-favorite Nazem Kadri, to the second unit, somehow considered innovative?</p>
      <p>Sheldon Keefe, who won his NHL debut on the bench Thursday with his team’s victory in Arizona, is in direct alignment with Dubas and Shanahan. There were questions within the industry the past couple of summers about the 39-year-old’s readiness for the big stage despite his AHL success with the Marlies. That is believed the primary reason the Rangers went with David Quinn to replace Alain Vigneault two summers ago rather than wait to speak to Keefe, whose team was in the midst of a successful Calder Cup championship run while the Blueshirts were in their search mode.</p>
      <p>But the Maple Leafs, who know him best, do believe Keefe is prepared for prime time. Ready or not, he will coach to the team’s strengths and not against the organization’s front office.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In New Jersey, where the Devils own the fewest regulation victories in the NHL with five and are 30th-overall in the standings, the only question worth asking is whether the metaphorical bomb will drop on or off the ice?</p>
      <p>Which is to ponder whom Ray Shero moves out first, John Hynes from behind the bench (and please say no to Babcock as a potential replacement) or Taylor Hall, who somehow has conspired to score three goals in 21 games?</p>

      <p>If the Flames knew they could sign Hall to an extension, would they move Johnny Gaudreau (five goals, 18 assists, 23 points in 25 games and with a cap hit of $6.75 million per through 2021-22) for the pending free agent?</p>
      <p>Would the Devils make that deal, or would Shero seek a more traditional rental return (first-rounder, prospect, et al) for No. 9?</p>

      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/devils-waive-cory-schneider-amid-continuous-struggles/">Cory Schneider’s demotion to the AHL</a> recalls the 2011 Cup finals and the goaltending decision Vigneault did not make that could well have cost the Canucks the Stanley Cup.</p>
      <p>Vancouver had a 3-2 edge in the series heading into Game 6 in Boston, where Roberto Luongo had allowed eight goals in the final two periods of the Game 3, 8-1 defeat, then was yanked in favor of Schneider after allowing four goals in 43:17 in the Game 4, 4-0 loss.</p>
      <p>Luongo, who had allowed two goals on 97 shots in three victories at home that included a pair of shutouts (0.67 GAA, .979 save percentage), had surrendered 12 goals on 51 shots in his last 83:17 in Boston (8.65/.765).</p>
      <p>Vigneault could have gone to Schneider, who’d been outstanding as the understudy and had played 15:15 of shutout hockey in Game 4, for Game 6. A victory would have clinched the Cup while a defeat would not have pierced Luongo’s psyche in advance of an ultimate Game 7.</p>
      <p>Instead, the coach stuck with his No. 1, who surrendered three goals on eight shots in 8:35 before getting pulled for Schneider in a 5-2 defeat that presaged the Bruins’ Game 7, Cup-winning 4-0 triumph with Luongo in nets.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>So if the NHL is forever fiddling with rules in order to promote offense, is it not time for a carryover power play to begin with an offensive zone faceoff rather than the traditional period-opening draw at the center dot?</p>
      <p>Why, yes. Yes it is.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Through Friday, 17 of the NHL’s 31 teams had won nine, 10 or 11 games. While 26 — 26! — teams somehow could claim records of .500 or better.</p>
      <p>That’s parity, folks, only it is spelled P-A-R-O-D-Y.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>OK, so about two months in, who do you have, P.K. Subban or Jacob Trouba?</p>
