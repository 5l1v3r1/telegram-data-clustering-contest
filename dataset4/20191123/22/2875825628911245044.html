      <p>Andrew Maxwell broke down in tears and threatened to walk out on tonight's I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The comedian confessed he had "hit a wall" as he became "overwhelmed" with jungle life.</p>
      <p>Andrew had an emotional chat with Jacqueline Jossa, who he argued with earlier this week before apologising, about his desire to leave camp.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Andrew said: "I was up in the Leaders Cabin, I was chatting to James and Jacqueline and I was just so tired, I just hit a wall."</p>
      <p>When James went for a shower, the Ex On The Beach voiceover turned to Jacqueline and confessed he was considering quitting.</p>

      <p>Andrew said: "I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say ‘have I done the right thing’."</p>
      <p>Ex-EastEnders star Jacqueline told him: "You’d never leave, I can tell that, you’re just tired."</p>
      <p>Emotional Andrew began to cry, but was comforted by Jacqueline, who explained to returning James that he was "tired".</p>

      <p>As Jacqueline hugged Andrew, reassuring James said: "Everyone has a bad day."</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star said: "He’s been sleeping on the floor, he’s had 6 nights on the floor."</p>
      <p>Telling Andrew that he could not leave, James added: "You’re an important part of the group and we need you."</p>

      <p>James and Jacqueline advised the comedian to eat some beans to build up his strength.</p>
      <p>When Andrew claimed he was just tired, Jacqueline said: "You’ve spent over two weeks away from your family, it’s a long time."</p>
      <p>Andrew said: “I’m just a little bit overwhelmed right now."</p>

      <p>James tried to convince Andrew to stay by reeling off a list of what he brings to camp.</p>
      <p>The rugby player said: "You’re brilliant, you bring so much energy and laughter."</p>
      <p>Kind James stayed chatting to Andrew and reassured the comedian that he would look after him for the rest of their time in the jungle.</p>

      <p>This comes just a day after Andrew started chocking on camel meat and was saved by his fellow campmates.</p>
      <p>The comedian got camel meat lodged in his throat leaving him struggling to breathe.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway and Andy Whyment rushed over to help choking Andrew as he sat on his knees trying to bring the food up.</p>
      <p>As they slapped his back, they helped him spit it out, before he looked up to the heavens.</p>
