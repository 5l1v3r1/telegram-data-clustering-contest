      <h2>Eddie O'Rourke, 18, was fatally knifed in the stomach by love rival Joe Ward outside a birthday party in Runcorn, Cheshire and his mum has spoken about his death</h2>

      <p>A heartbroken mum 'just knew' her son wasn't coming back after he was stabbed to death in a row over a girl.</p>
      <p>Eddie O'Rourke's long-running love rivalry with Joe Ward came to a tragic end when he was knifed in the stomach outside a birthday party in Runcorn, Cheshire.</p>
      <p>His last words to mum Jayne White had been 'mum I love you, I'm going out', I'll come and see you later'."</p>
      <p>Paramedics fought to save the 18-year-old but the killer blade had severed a main artery, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/">Manchester Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>His mum Jayne White recalled the moment she was told by doctors her son had passed away, how she sat there among the screaming and the crying and just asked 'is this actually happening?'</p>
      <p>Speaking publicly for the first time since Eddie's death, Jayne shared her story in support of Cheshire Police's Tackling Weapons Conference, which took place on Thursday.</p>

      <p>In the emotional footage, she relives the night her boy was taken from her.</p>
      <p>"The day Eddie passed away, it was just a normal day," she said.</p>
      <p>"I used to get up before him and run his bath and stuff but this morning I never, and I remember him shouting up to me, 'mum I love you, I'm going out', I'll come and see you later'."</p>
      <p>But Eddie never came home that night.</p>
      <p>The teenager went to a birthday party at the Royal British Legion in Halton Village, where he came face to face with Ward.</p>
      <p>Eddie gestured for the then 17-year-old to follow him outside.</p>
      <p>Ward did, but was caught on CCTV running straight back inside where he was handed a 12-inch knife by a 15-year-old boy in the doorway. <br/>Seconds later, Eddie was stabbed.</p>
      <p>"That night, we heard loads of sirens and things like that and me and the kids were in the house," Jayne added.</p>
      <p>"I was actually going the shop, then someone came in a car and said Jayne you're going to have to come to the Legion because Eddie's not well, he's been stabbed.</p>

      <p>"Eddie had had incidents before, with the person who murdered him and he'd been slashed before on his arm so when they said he was ill and that he'd been stabbed I don't know what I thought, I just thought it's Eddie, he'll be okay, he'll be fine.</p>
      <p>"But they came running into the house and I was screaming at them then because I knew that it was bad.</p>
      <p>"We got in the car and pulled out of our street and there was all traffic so I just got out of the car and I just ran all the way through to the village and I saw the ambulance and the ambulance men resuscitating him and I just wanted to see him, but I couldn't, I couldn't see him.</p>
      <p>"So I just walked over to the ambulance and shouted through the door, 'Eddie I'm here it's your mum'.</p>
      <p>"I knew as soon as I ran through the village that he wasn't going to come back, that he was dead."</p>

      <p>Eddie was rushed to Warrington Hospital, and Jayne followed in a car behind him.</p>
      <p>"I remember waiting in the family room [at the hospital] for quite a while then three doctors came in and asked who was mum, I said me, and she just said we tried everything that we could but they couldn't bring him back.</p>
      <p>"I was just sat there, and everyone else was screaming and bawling and I just sat there and looked at her and said 'is this actually happening?' and she said 'yes, it's happening'."</p>
      <p>Ward and the 15-year-old boy - who can't be named for legal reasons - ran from the scene after the attack but were arrested the next day.</p>

      <p>Both pleaded not guilty to Eddie's murder, but following a five-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court in April this year, Ward was convicted of the offence and sentenced to a minimum of 16 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter and handed a seven-year custodial sentence to be served at a young offenders’ institute.</p>
      <p>Sentencing the pair, Lord Justice King told them: "Knife crime destroys lives, including those who carry the knives.</p>
      <p>“Had a knife never been brought to the party, Eddie O’Rourke would still be alive and neither of you would be facing the sentences you are.</p>
      <p>“If I had the means I would educate all children to have nothing to do with knives."</p>
