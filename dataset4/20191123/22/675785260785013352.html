      <p>TV comic John Bishop has revealed how a terrifying cancer scare left him “contemplating death”.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old Liverpudlian was sent for an X-ray after suffering a prolonged cough three years ago.</p>
      <p>He explained: “I was told that unless I heard anything, I should regard everything as normal and the cough would go.</p>
      <p>“I heard nothing and gradually my chest cleared, so I thought no more about it.</p>
      <p>“Three months later I received a call saying the results of the X-ray had been misreported by one of the junior staff.</p>

      <p>His GP said he needed an emergency CT scan – “and something in his tone suggested it needing doing sooner rather than later,” said John.</p>
      <p>“So I organised a private CT scan at the local hospital. I spent a few hours alone thinking it could be the start of the end.</p>
      <p>“This is because a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> search of ‘shadows on lungs’ does not make you believe the prognosis will be good.”</p>
      <p>John, who has three sons with wife Melanie, says: “It was the first time I had seriously contemplated my own death. I was filled with sadness for all the things I’d miss – my family, my sons getting married, my parents, becoming a grandparent, laughing, blue sky days when you are so happy that you almost feel guilty to be so lucky. Football, music, films.</p>
      <p>“Death takes away everything, although this isn’t all bad. I suddenly realised I did not have to care any more about what <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> did, if the ice caps were going to melt and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> vote.</p>
      <p>“I had seen this before with people facing terminal illness. There is a sense of contentment and balance hard to explain. All that matters are those you love.”</p>

      <p>In his book How to Grow Old, John told how Melanie came with him to the scan and that they were both “nervous”.</p>
      <p>“The GP called me as soon as he had the results. I had shadows on both lungs but it was nothing sinister and was caused by increased bone mass in my sternum.</p>
      <p>“I put the phone down grateful for the life I had ahead of me.</p>
      <p>"I embraced Melanie and then on the radio in the background I heard Trump was saying global warming was a myth, and I started worrying again.”</p>
