      <p>A total of 1,600 members of the emergency services were mobilised to deal with the emergency.</p>
      <p>Numerous roads were cut off and rail traffic was halted from the Cote d'Azur to the Italian border until at least Sunday.</p>
      <p>Flights from Nice international airport were suspended during the day and due to resume late Saturday.</p>
      <p>In Nice itself, alert sirens sounded to urge people to stay indoors. Most residents complied and the streets were almost deserted by late afternoon on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Four thousand homes were left without electricity due to the bad weather and flooding.</p>
      <p>In several towns, including Hyeres and Frejus, hundreds of residents were evacuated as a preventative measure. Shelter was provided in municipal buildings.</p>
      <p>A 39-year-old woman was seriously injured after being carried along by a wave, according to firefighters.</p>
      <p>A 78-year-old man was also hospitalised with hypothermia after being trapped by a tree trunk brought down by a landslide.</p>
      <p>The French authorities warned late Saturday that with more heavy rain on the way and rivers in the area already overflowing their banks that the flooding will continue to worsen".</p>
      <p>They urged local residents to stay indoors, be careful near water courses and not to use their vehicles unless strictly necessary.</p>
      <p>Other regions of southern France, including Gard and Haute-Loire, were put on orange weather warnings.</p>
