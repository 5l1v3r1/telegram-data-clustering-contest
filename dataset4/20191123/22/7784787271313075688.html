      <h1>This is every AFL club’s future draft pick hand. 15 are seriously hamstrung</h1>

      <h3>It has been pick swap galore in the week leading up to the draft, with four deals struck in four days.</h3>
      <p>However, there is a method to the madness of the recruiting teams, with several clubs looking for ways to get back into the juicy part of the 2019 draft.</p>
      <p>More than half of the AFL clubs are severely hamstrung in their attempts to trade future picks over the next week, due to the league’s strict rules and regulations.</p>

      <p>A quartet of clubs — GWS, Melbourne, Port Adelaide and West Coast — currently don’t hold first-round picks for the 2020 draft. It means they are not permitted to trade any future selections at the draft next Wednesday and Thursday, unless they receive a 2020 first-rounder back from a rival club.</p>
      <p>However, the Giants, Power and Eagles can trade a third-round selection as they have two at their disposal.</p>
      <p>The other clubs impacted will be Carlton, Essendon, Fremantle, Gold Coast, St Kilda, Sydney Swans and Western Bulldogs - seven teams that have already traded away at least one of their 2020 selections. Due to that, all seven clubs will not be allowed to trade their future first-round pick, unless they replenish the specific round future selections they recently lost.</p>

      <p>It means more than half of the league’s clubs will need to get creative if they want to move up the draft order or stockpile picks.</p>
      <p>These restrictions are designed to protected clubs from themselves, potentially selling the farm and failing on field.</p>
      <p>“If a club trades a future first-round selection, it may not trade any other future selection from that same draft,” the AFL regulations read.</p>
      <p>“But if a club keeps its future first-round selection, it can trade any of its future selections from other rounds.”</p>
      <p>Adelaide, Brisbane Lions, Geelong and North Melbourne all have two first-round selections in their armour for 2020, which would allow any of them to trade if a deal appealed.</p>

      <p>AFL clubs are keen to trade selections out of 2020, with next year’s draft crop appearing to be thinner and highly compromised due to the array of father-son and academy selections across the 18 clubs.</p>
      <p>“I’d rather have a pick this year, as I don’t think it’s anywhere near as strong next year,” player manager Liam Pickering explained on <i>SEN SA</i>.</p>
      <p>“Next year’s draft will be very thin.”</p>
