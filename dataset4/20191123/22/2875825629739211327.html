      <h2>The DJ implored her campmates to sing encouragement as she was forced to chow down on a cow's anus to win that all important twelfth and final star</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:10:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> latest stomach-churning trial had DJ Adele Roberts begging her jungle pals to soothe her with song as she was forced to snack on something truly disgusting.</p>
      <p>Before Adele boldly tucked into the cow's anus, she turned to her campmates and urged them to sing encouragement to keep it down and win the twelfth star - and twelfth meal - for camp.</p>
      <p>The trial, called Pest Office, involved Andrew Maxwell, Andy Whyment, Myles Stephenson, Jacqueline Jossa and Kate Garraway behind bars, with the remaining celebs taking on challenges to free them and let them return to the - relative - comfort of the main camp.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for all, Adele managed not to throw up and earned the final meal for camp.</p>
      <p>Nadine had to do the same, with James and Caitlyn being served cow's eyes.</p>

      <p>It wasn't the first time Adele had been put through the ringer that day, as she had to hold a spiny leaf insect in her mouth, before all eyes turned to Ian as he kept six witchetty grubs in his mouth to win the second star.</p>
      <p>Cliff did the same with meal worms, winning a third and freeing Kate from jail.</p>
      <p>"It's another day to excel," Caitlyn's campmates mocked her as she stepped up to the mark, winning another star, before James popped in a giant burrowing beetle and choosing to free Jacqueline.</p>

      <p>"I missed you guys!" the soap star gushed as she joined her pals.</p>
      <p>Andrew, Andy and Myles remained behind bars, covered in cockroaches and mealworms.</p>
      <p>All three made it out thanks to Caitlyn, Ian, Adele and Nadine.</p>

      <p>Tonight also saw a touching moment of camp unity as the new pals gathered to vote James to be the camp leader.</p>
      <p>He nearly choked up as he told them: "Thank you. That's very kind of you all."</p>
      <p>"You better be good or we're gonna fire you," Caitlyn joked.</p>
      <p>"Don't start with me, you won't win," James came back.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn chuckled: "I can't! You're the king!"</p>
      <p>Despite James and Jacqueline joking that Ian would moan whatever chores he was given, Ian admitted he felt James was "perfect to be a leader."</p>
      <p>"I know a leader when I see one," he said solemnly.</p>
