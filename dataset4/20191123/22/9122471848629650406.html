      <h1>Video: Wisconsin Kicker Drills 62-Yard Field Goal</h1>

      <p>In order to keep their hopes of winning the Big Ten West alive, the Wisconsin Badgers need to defeat the Purdue Boilermakers this afternoon. The coaching staff can’t just rely on Jonathan Taylor to lead them to victory, they need all three phases to contribute.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for the Badgers, every unit has stepped up in the first half against the Boilermakers.</p>
      <p>Jack Coan is having one of his best performances of the season, completing 12-of-14 pass attempts for 143 yards and a touchdown. He’s receiving help from Taylor in this game as the star tailback already has 114 rushing yards and a touchdown of his own.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin’s defense hasn’t played up to its standards in the first half, but it has neutralized Purdue’s rushing attack so far.</p>
      <p>The play of the first half surprisingly game from kicker Zach Hintze, who connected on a 62-yard field goal as time expired.</p>
      <p>Hintze couldn’t help but celebrate once he made the kick.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>Even kickers in the NFL struggle to make a field goal from this distance. It seemed as if Hintze’s attempt had a few yards to spare.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin leads 24-17 heading into the half.</p>
      <p>The rest of the game can be seen on FOX.</p>
