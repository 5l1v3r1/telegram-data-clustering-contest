      <h1>Liverpool starlet Rhian Brewster wanted by Aston Villa in January loan move</h1>
      <h2>The young forward has barely featured for the Reds this season and could go out on loan to gain valuable first-team minutes in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool starlet Rhian Brewster is a loan target for several clubs in January — with Aston Villa leading the race.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Jurgen Klopp revealed on Friday that he was willing to let the 19-year-old go out for the second half of the season to get more first-team football. Villa boss Dean Smith wants Brewster to add another option up front.</p>
      <p>But he faces competition from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> boss Roy Hodgson as well as Championship outfits Leeds and Swansea.</p>
      <p>Brewster has failed to break into the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> first-team at the start of this season, making only two starts, both of them coming in the Carabao Cup.</p>

      <p>With the likes of Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino way ahead of him in the pecking order at Anfield, Brewster will no doubt see his chances for playing time improved vastly with a loan move, and it remains to be seen where he ends up.</p>
      <p>Both Villa and Palace have struggled for goals this season. Villa splashed the cash over the summer but striker Wesley has so far scored just four goals in 12 Premier League games, with midfielder John McGinn their second top scorer in the league with three strikes.</p>
      <p>Palace, meanwhile, signed Jordan Ayew over the summer, and he has re-paid them with four goals in the league, but other than him they have a lack of striking options, with Christian Benteke yet to get off the mark in 11 Premier League appearances so far this season.</p>

      <p>Reds manager Jurgen Klopp was initially reportedly not keen on the idea of Brewster leaving on loan, but may now have softened his stance.</p>
      <p>When asked by <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/rhian-brewster-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-sadio-mane-virgil-van-dijk-tammy-abraham">FourFourTwo</a> in September about the potential of a loan move Brewster said: "Yeah, I spoke to him (Klopp) at the beginning of the season and he just said “no”. He doesn’t want me to go on loan, he wants me to stay. So that’s fair enough and it’s good to hear."</p>
