      <p>It has been a relatively quiet start to celebrations on the Gold Coast for interstate Schoolies with only a handful of arrests.</p>
      <p>School leavers from New South Wales and Victoria descended on the Glitter Strip on Saturday as Queensland kids headed home with sore heads after a week of partying.</p>
      <p>18 people were arrested in the party precinct overnight but only six of those were Schoolies.</p>
      <p>Police laid 22 charges all up, mostly for drug possession and public nuisance.</p>
      <p>But one person was charged with stealing.</p>
      <p>Police will be maintaining a strong presence in Surfers Paradise for the next couple of weeks however their focus will change.</p>
      <p>With the majority of interstate school leavers over the age of 18, officers will be keeping a much closer eye on pubs and clubs.</p>
      <p>“We actually walk through premises, we talk to licensed premises, we talk to business owners, we actually talk to people and make sure they’re having fun,” Chief Superintendent Craig Hanlon said.</p>
      <p>Queensland school leavers were praised for their behaviour with just 42 arrests across their week of celebrations, down 50 per cent on last year.</p>
