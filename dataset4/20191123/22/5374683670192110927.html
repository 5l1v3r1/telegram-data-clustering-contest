      <p>Shots were fired Saturday afternoon at a police car in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad.</p>
      <p>Police officers returned fire.</p>
      <p>No one was injured, but the squad car was damaged.</p>
      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu responded: "The shooting at a police car in Deir al-Asad is unacceptable and I would like to stand by the police. We will apprehend the rioters and deal with them to the fullest extent of the law."</p>
