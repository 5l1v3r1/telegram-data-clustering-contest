      <h1>Gus Malzahn Pleads With Ref After Targeting Call: “We’ve Got The Iron Bowl Next Week”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:16:12+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Auburn crushed Samford on Saturday, but the Tigers didn’t escape the game completely unscathed. Defensive back Jamien Sherwood was ejected for targeting, meaning he’ll miss the first half against Alabama next week.</p>
      <p>Sherwood, with his team leading 38-0 in the third quarter, put a vicious hit on Samford quarterback Liam Welch. The referees ruled Welch to be a defenseless player, upholding the call and his ejection.</p>
      <p>Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn, in response, could be heard yelling at the referee, who is apparently named Mark. Malzahn pleads with the referee, reminding him that the Tigers have Alabama in the Iron Bowl next week.</p>
      <p>“Mark, Mark. We’ve got the Iron Bowl next week.”</p>
      <p>Here’s video:</p>

      <p>It isn’t the best look for Malzahn, but it’s also a reality that head coaches plead with officials in every game. Malzahn just got caught on camera and it’s making the rounds on the internet.</p>
      <p>As for the Iron Bowl, this one is going to be huge. Alabama can’t win the SEC West, but it could still sneak into the College Football Playoff regardless. Auburn will be looking to expose the Crimson Tide now that they have Mac Jones in for an injured Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback. It should be a great one.</p>
