      <h1>Basketball: UVic Vikes wear down Brandon Bobcats’ seven</h1>

      <p>The Magnificent Seven hung on for as long as they could before being worn down by the University of Victoria.</p>
      <p>The Vikes (4-2) defeated the Brandon Bobcats, who had only seven players dressed, 85-62 in Canada West men’s basketball action Saturday night on the Ken and Kathy Shields Court in CARSA Gym. Brandon (1-7) led 35-25 in the second quarter and took a 37-33 lead into half-time.</p>
      <p>The game featured the two teams that dominated Canadian university basketball in the 1980s, with UVic winning seven national titles and Brandon three in that decade. But that’s ancient history to current players such as Scott Kellum, who weren’t even born in the era of UVic stars such as two-time Olympians Eli Pasquale and Gerald Kazanowski. The Bobcats made a game of it before Kellum started hitting from the outside for UVic in the second half, finishing with 18 points, including four three-pointers.</p>
      <p>“Brandon is dangerous and can’t be taken lightly,” said Kellum, former Canada West rookie of the year, now in his fourth season. “But with only seven guys, we knew we had to play with energy and push the ball, to make them tired,” said the native of Issaquah, Washington.</p>
      <p>UVic also got the ball inside with forward Dominick Oliveri, another Washington import, and Matthew Ellis recording 14 points each. The Vikes won Friday’s game 86-59 on 15 points each by Ellis and prize rookie-guard Diego Maffia.</p>
      <p>The UVic Vikes women’s team reacted to being knocked out of the weekly U Sports national top-10 ranking by sweeping Brandon. The U Sports honourable mention Vikes (5-1) put up nearly triple digits on Friday in a 98-59 victory and followed up with an 80-58 win on Saturday against the winless Bobcats (0-8).</p>
      <p>“Looking at the rankings is not a good thing,” said Aleah Ashlee, the fourth-year player from Comox, who had eight points and five rebounds Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ashlee said the Vikes worry about their own play, not about trying to impress pollsters.</p>
      <p>“We showed this weekend our whole bench can play. And we all root for each other,” Ashlee said.</p>
      <p>Guard Kristy Gallagher followed up her 18 points Friday with 13 on Saturday. Forward Ashlyn Day had 16 points both nights. “We worked on the little things in practice [after splitting with Alberta last weekend],” Gallagher said.</p>
      <p>Vikes head coach Dani Sinclair said the rankings weren’t even talked about over the week. “We were voted No. 12 [dropping from No. 9], which is about where I have us at the moment,” Sinclair said. “We have shown flashes, but have not been consistent enough yet.”</p>
      <p>The Vikes squads are in Calgary next weekend to take on Mount Royal.</p>
