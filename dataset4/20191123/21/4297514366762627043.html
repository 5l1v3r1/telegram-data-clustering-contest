        <b>Markstrom makes 32 saves for Vancouver</b>
      </p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Jacob Markstrom stopped 32 shots and then denied seven more during an extended shootout, helping the Vancouver Canucks beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Elias Pettersson scored his 10th goal for Vancouver, which earned its second straight win since a stretch of seven losses in eight games. It was the Canucks’ 12th power-play goal in their last seven games.</p>
      <p>Bo Horvat scored the decisive goal in the seventh round of the shootout.</p>
      <p>Washington finished with one goal for the third time this season despite Vancouver losing defenceman Alexander Edler to an upper-body injury.</p>
      <p>Jakub Vrana scored his 11th goal for the Capitals, and Braden Holtby made 32 saves.</p>

      <p>Washington thought it had won the shootout on Lars Eller’s attempt in the fifth round. Originally credited as a goal, it was overturned after replays showed Eller’s shot striking Markstrom’s leg and then the post, but never crossing the goal line.</p>
      <p>Vrana put Washington in front with a one-timer 2:22 into the game after Eller dug the puck off the boards to set him up.</p>
      <p>Pettersson responded with six minutes left in the first, ripping another one-timer past Holtby’s glove side on a 5-on-3 power play during which defenceman Michal Kempny lost his stick.</p>
      <p>The Canucks had a power-play chance in overtime after Evgeny Kuznetsov hooked Christopher Tanev, but Holtby denied Quinn Hughes and J.T. Miller.</p>
      <p>On the other end, Markstrom twice stood up Alex Ovechkin inside the final minute of overtime.</p>
