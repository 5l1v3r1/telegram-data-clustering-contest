      <h1>Kamala Flat Out Lies When She Tells Iowans Medicare for All Wouldn't Eliminate Private Insurance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:26:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bethbaumann" target="_blank">Beth Baumann</a></address>
      <p>California Sen. Kamala Harris (D) told a group of people in Muscatine, Iowa that she will not take away private health insurance or raise the middle class' taxes.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to raise middle class taxes, and I'm not going to take away your choice," Harris explained. "Because I heard from too many people that said, 'Kamala, yeah, I want to know that everyone's going to be covered. I like what you're doing to extend benefits to include vision and hearing and also hearing aids and dental.'"</p>
      <p>"The prime distinction between my plan and a couple of folks on the stage is I'm not trying to get rid of the private insurance companies," she explained. "They need to be brought to bare on ending co-pays and deductibles and they need to compete with our system but I'm not going to take away your choice."</p>

      <p>But if you look at Harris' <a href="https://kamalaharris.org/policies/medicare-for-all/full-policy/">Medicare for All plan</a>, she <i>doesÂ </i>want to take away a person's right to choose (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>Second, we will set up an expanded Medicare system, with a 10-year phase-in period. During this transition, <b>we will automatically enroll newborns and the uninsured into this new and improved Medicare system</b>, give all doctors time to get into the system, and provide a commonsense path for employers, employees, the underinsured, and others on federally-designated programs, such as Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, to transition. <b>This will expand the number of insured Americans and create a new viable public system that guarantees universal coverage at a lower cost.</b> Expanding the transition window will also lower the overall cost of the program.</blockquote>
      <p>If a newborn's parents have health insurance through a private employer, will a Harris administration still consider that child "uninsured?" Why couldn't that child be put on his or her parents' insurance plans?</p>
      <p>Expanding the number of insured Americans through Obamacare is what got us into this health care fiasco. Prices skyrocketed. Care went down the drain. It's been a disaster. And if someone is uninsured because they can't afford insurance, where does that money to pay for their care come from? Thin air?</p>
