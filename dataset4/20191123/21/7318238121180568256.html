      <p>As many as 7,000 people turned out Hannover, Germany on Saturday to protest against a march by extreme-right organisation, NPD.</p>
      <p>The city’s police department had banned the NPD rally, but the decision was overturned by a court ruling.</p>
      <p>According to observers, about 100 right-wing extremists participated in the NPD event, which was directed at three journalists who have reported on the extremism scene and the rise of neo-Nazis.</p>
      <p>The campaign group Reporters Without Borders said that “attacks on journalists and interference with their private lives are no longer a rarity."</p>
      <p>Among those joining the larger counter-protest was the city’s new Green party mayor, Belit Onay.</p>
