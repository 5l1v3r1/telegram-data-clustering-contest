        <b>THE long-lost nephew of lottery millionaire Fred Higgins was handed a boost in the hunt for his missing mum.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ian Cooke, 61, was told the £58million jackpot winner and wife Lesley were examining his appeal for info to trace Scots mother Alexandrina, who vanished in 1964.</p>

      <p>Hailing the statement, Ian said: “Hopefully this is good news but I don’t want to get my hopes up too much. It’s been going on too long.</p>
      <p>“I just want to know where my mum is and have so many questions for them.”</p>
      <p>We told last week how Fred’s eldest sister gave Ian up for adoption when he was just six.</p>
      <p>Ian, of Notts, was later told Alexandrina died before finding evidence she may be alive.</p>
      <p>He also discovered a link to his uncle Fred, 69, from Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, and Lesley, 59, before appealing for their help.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the couple, who won the EuroMillions prize last August, said: “We are looking into this.”</p>
