      <h1>Ryan Day Issues Update On Ohio State QB Justin Fields</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:24:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Ohio State took care of business against Penn State to keep its undefeated season alive. With a 28-17 win, the Buckeyes clinched a spot in the Big Ten title game by winning the Big Ten East.</p>
      <p>Even a loss against Michigan next weekend can’t keep the Buckeyes from the title game, though Ohio State doesn’t plan to lose that one.</p>
      <p>In the final minutes of the fourth quarter, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields appeared to suffer an injury. On a fourth-down play, Fields attempted to escape the Penn State rush.</p>
      <p>He was tackled and appeared to have his leg roll awkwardly underneath him. Fields stayed on the ground for a minute before eventually jogging off the field under his own power.</p>
      <p>After the game, Ohio State head coach Ryan Day updated the status of his star quarterback.</p>
      <p>“He’s good,” Day said about Fields.</p>

      <p>That’s great news for the Buckeyes as they head into the final week of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Fields is undoubtedly one of the best quarterbacks in the country and pivotal to Ohio State’s success this year. The Buckeyes have their sights set on a Big Ten title and potential College Football Playoff berth.</p>
      <p>Next up is a trip to Michigan.</p>
