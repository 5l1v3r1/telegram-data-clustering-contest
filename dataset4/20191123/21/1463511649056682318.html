      <h1>Emefiele urges private sector players to float infrastructure bond</h1>

      <p>The Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has advised corporate bodies in the country to take advantage of the Presidential Order 7 to raise infrastructure bonds at concessionary rates to support the Federal Government in its desire to develop infrastructure in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Emefiele gave the charge on Saturday during an inspection of the ongoing road construction from the Apapa Port to the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway toll gate, being undertaken by the Dangote Group.</p>
      <p>He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Executive Order Number 7, which opened the opportunity for private companies to intervene in infrastructure.</p>
      <p>According to him, the Apapa Port road being constructed by the Dangote Group was comparable to those constructed in countries with more developed technology.</p>
      <p>“It is a good thing for this country. When we talk about the Ease of Doing Business, you can imagine a situation whereby people have been complaining about the ease of transporting their goods out of the Apapa port,” he added</p>
      <p>While commending Dangote for taking the initiative, Emefiele expressed hope that the road would ease the traffic challenge on the route, particularly for trucks conveying cleared goods from the ports.</p>
      <p>He further commended the Dangote Group for using local content, stressing: “This is 100 per cent local content. </p>
      <p>“Alhaji Dangote uses his cement on this road, the rods I understand are coming from African Foundries that smelted waste steel, which is converted into iron bars and are being used for the road.”</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier, Dangote assured that the first phase of the construction would be ready before the end of December 2019.</p>
