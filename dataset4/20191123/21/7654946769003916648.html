      <p>An <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-claims-photo-with-epstein-sex-slave-is-fake-because-he-doesnt-hug/">infamous photo of Prince Andrew</a> with his arm around a 17-year-old Virginia Roberts is probably real, a leading image doctoring expert told the Sunday Times London.</p>
      <p>Hany Farid, a professor of digital forensics and image analysis at University of California, Berkeley said that while he couldn’t be 100% certain, the photos was almost certainly legit.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see any obvious signs of manipulation,” he told the paper.</p>
      <p>“The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew’s head spliced onto another person’s body,” he added. “The image was clearly taken with a flash (you can see the reflection of the flash in the window and there is the red-eye). You can also see the strong cast shadow for the two people on the right onto the wall behind them.”</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">an interview with the BBC last week</a>, the royal appeared to imply the photo might have been doctored.</p>
      <p>“I have absolutely no memory of that photograph,” he insisted. “I’m afraid to say that I don’t believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.”</p>
      <p>Andrew’s relationship with disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has created a deepening crisis for the British royal family. This week, his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, formally <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-didnt-step-back-from-royal-duties-queen-elizabeth-fired-him/">relieved Andrew of his royal duties</a>.</p>
