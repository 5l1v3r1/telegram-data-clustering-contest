        <b>Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-mel-owen-dies-surviving-car-explosion-11127193/">met her demise</a> in EastEnders several weeks back when she was hit by a lorry following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/eastenders-spoilers-mel-owen-dies-in-car-crash-horror-with-sharon-mitchell-11086537/">a cataclysmic car crash,</a> which occurred during <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/eastenders-spoilers-mel-owen-exposes-sharon-mitchells-affair-to-phil-over-the-airport-tannoy-10937413/">a high-speed chase</a> with Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean). The legendary character was attempting to reveal that Sharon’s baby isn’t Phil’s (Steve McFadden) but she was tragically killed before she could do so.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Upon learning the news of her best mate’s death, Lisa (Lucy Benjamin) was devastated, and resolved to get revenge on her behalf. Yes, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-lisa-fowler-accuses-sharon-mitchell-of-murdering-mel-owen-dead-11126736/">calling Sharon a murderer</a>, she proceeded to reveal the truth to Phil, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-phil-mitchell-discovers-truth-sharon-baby-mel-owen-dead-11126982/">claiming that Sharon’s child isn’t his</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Phil refused to believe it and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-lisa-fowlers-exit-storyline-confirmed-as-phil-mitchell-threatens-to-kill-her-11177476/">proceeded to threaten her if she didn’t stop spreading these so-called lies</a>.</p>

      <p>With Louise (Tilly Keeper) concerned for her mum’s wellbeing, it’s clear that all those around Lisa believe that she’s having a breakdown — which, according to them, would explain the claims she’s been making.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Although her claims are more than accurate, it’s true that Lisa’s struggling to cope with Mel’s death, and new images have revealed how devastated she is as the day of her life-long friend’s funeral arrives.</p>

      <p>Yes, it’s an emotional day in Walford, as the residents of the Square gather to bid farewell to Mel.</p>
      <p>However, with Lisa struggling to come to terms with what’s happened, will she manage to keep her cool as she bids adieu to her best mate?</p>

      <p>Or will the emotional day result in her continuing on Mel’s mission to get revenge on the Mitchells? Phil attempted to silence her once already, but whether or not she’s intent on seeing Sharon suffer remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Either way, Mel’s funeral will no doubt be a sad day, given just how iconic an EastEnders character she truly was.</p>
