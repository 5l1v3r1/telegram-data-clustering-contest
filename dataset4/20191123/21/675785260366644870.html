      <p>Thousands of students are still living in accommodation with the same flammable cladding as tragic Grenfell Tower.</p>
      <p>A total of 62 university and college blocks were identified as being coated in the material that helped spread the 2017 inferno.</p>
      <p>But only nine have had it stripped off, leaving 53 where it is still in place.</p>
      <p>According to a report a ten-storey, 75-bedroom tower at Highbury College in Portsmouth has failed a safety test, although officials say there are “no immediate concerns”.</p>
      <p>Portsmouth City Council said it was liaising with the building’s owners and Hampshire fire chiefs to ensure the cladding was removed.</p>

      <p>The revelation comes a week after 100 people were evacuated amid a fire at a student flat block in Bolton.</p>
      <p>A blaze which destroyed a block of cladding-covered flats in Brighton in 30 minutes is being probed.</p>
