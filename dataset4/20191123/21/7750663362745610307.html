      <p>The 25-year-old missed four league matches earlier this season with a hamstring problem but has been a regular for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>'s side during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the full-back made his third straight Premier League start against Manchester City on Saturday night, although he was replaced during his team's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/result/result-mahrez-nets-winner-as-man-city-overcome-chelsea_380403.html">2-1 loss</a> at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Corriere dello Sport</i>, Juve boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/maurizio-sarri/"><b>Maurizio Sarri</b></a> is determined to strengthen his defence during the January transfer window, and Emerson has emerged as a target for the Italian champions.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian-born Italy international turned out for Roma between 2015 and 2018 before joining Chelsea, while he has also appeared for Palermo in Serie A.</p>
      <p>Juve are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/inter-juve-consider-chris-smalling-offers_379842.html">also thought</a> to be weighing up a swoop for Manchester United defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-smalling/"><b>Chris Smalling</b></a> having been impressed with his performances for loan club Roma this term.</p>
