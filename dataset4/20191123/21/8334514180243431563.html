      <p>The NFL fined Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph $50,000 for his role in the altercation toward the conclusion of a game against the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 14, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The fine represents more than an entire game check for Rudolph, whose yearly base salary is $658,267.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was not suspended for his involvement in the incident, which included Browns defensive end Myles Garrett ripping the helmet off the quarterback and using it as a weapon.</p>
      <p>Garrett claimed Rudolph used a racial slur, although the NFL said it found no evidence of that.</p>
      <p>Garrett has been suspended indefinitely, Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi was banned one game and Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey was suspended for two after initially receiving a three-game ban.</p>
      <p>Additionally, both teams were fined $250,000.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero also tweeted the list of 29 members of the two teams who were fined $3,507 each for leaving the sidelines and entering the “fighting area.”</p>
