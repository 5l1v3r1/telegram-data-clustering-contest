      </p>
      <p>The Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), has called on the Nigerian Navy to counter Maritime terrorism and protect the nation’s critical economic infrastructure against sabotage.</p>
      <p>The Defence Minister, noted that apart from combating insurgency, Nigeria’s Maritime area need to be rid of all forms of criminality.</p>
      <p>He therefore charged the Nigerian Navy to redouble its efforts in the discharge of its duties, adding that the Navy’s operational environment is fraught with challenges.</p>
      <p>Magashi who made the call weekend, during the decoration of newly promoted flag Officers, assured that the Ministry of Defence will continue to support the Nigerian Navy and the entire Armed Forces to succeed.</p>
      <p>The Minister congratulated the promoted officers and enjoined them to justify the confidence reposed in them.</p>
      <p>In his speech, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas, highlighted the need for astute and courageous leadership in the Armed Forces.</p>

      <p>According to him, “the significance of today’s occasion is drawn from the critical need for quality leadership at the peak of organisation for the optimal realization of its objectives. Nowhere is such courageous and astute leadership required like in the Armed Forces, where your decisions on the employment of men and materials have profound impact on national security”.</p>
      <p>He continued that, “while the gates are open to many on entry into the Service only the most dedicated and loyal rise to the very pinnacle of the profession l. As we rejoice and felicitate with the newly promoted Officers, I must admit that the 16 flag Officers to be decorated today have distinguished themselves over time to earn the confidence and endorsement of the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”</p>
