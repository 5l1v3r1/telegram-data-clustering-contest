      <h1>Gareth Bale heckled by angry Real Madrid fans following flag controversy</h1>
      <h2>Bale was criticised in Spain after being pictured celebrating Wales' Euro 2020 qualification victory over Hungary in midweek with a flag that read "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:36:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Angry Real Madrid fans heckled Gareth Bale as the Welshman made his return to club colours on Saturday and held up a banner which read: "Rodrygo. Vini. Lucas. Bale. In that order".</p>
      <p>Bale was criticised in Spain after being pictured celebrating Wales' Euro 2020 qualification victory over Hungary in midweek with a flag that read "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order".</p>
      <p>That came following accusations that Bale has been putting country before club in recent months, with the 30-year-old having played four times for Wales since his last appearance for Madrid on October 5.</p>
      <p>Bale, who has missed Madrid's last six matches after suffering a calf injury on international duty, made his Los Blancos return against Real Sociedad on Saturday night.</p>

      <p>But his appearance as a second-half substitute was not welcomed by the Madrid supporters, who made their feelings known from the stands.</p>
      <p>Fans could be seen booing the winger while others also held up banners in protest against the under-fire superstar.</p>
      <p>Before the game, manager Zinedine Zidane urged fans to throw their support behind Bale and the team.</p>
      <p>"When you look at what Bale has given to this club... the fans, the real ones, the ones who feel the colours, the ones who are here for the club, the people who are going to come to the stadium, know that Bale is part of our team and they have to be with him because he is with us," said Zidane.</p>

      <p>"Everyone has their own opinion and it's one thing that's already too much. You know the situation, he's been with the national team, he's been able to play and now he's with us.</p>
      <p>"He's given a lot to the club and I'm only going to look at the sporting aspect, because outside there are a lot of comments and I'm not here for that. I know a lot of people are interested, but I'm not.</p>
      <p>"I'll always be with the players, things can happen outside the club, but we'll always look out to the pitch, we don't control what's outside. I talked to Bale like I talk to all the players. He's fine, he's trained normally."</p>
      <p>While injuries have plagued his time in Spain, Bale has helped Madrid win four Champions League titles among a host of trophies since joining the club for a then world-record Â£85million in 2013.</p>

      <p>Zidane added: "Gareth is an important player, he's always proved it.</p>
      <p>"If he's OK and something doesn't happen to him, he's a very important player, he's proved it. Everyone who's injured is different, but when he's well, and now he's well, I'm going to count on him."</p>
      <p>Zidane said during pre-season that it would be "best for everyone" if Bale left the club, with the Welshman then seeing a possible move to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning come to nothing.</p>
      <p>Taking ahead of Saturday's game, the Frenchman added: "If one day he has to leave that is his decision, but what I can say about Gareth is today he is here with us, available and I am happy for the team."</p>
