      <p>Vinnie Jones has been eliminated from The X Factor: Celebrity - days after viewers threatened a boycott when Simon Cowell ignored his plea.</p>
      <p>The former footballer received the fewest votes from the public, and leaves the competition ahead of the live final next week.</p>
      <p>Jones said his experience on the show has been "absolutely fantastic" and he thanked show boss Simon Cowell for "inviting me to be part of this".</p>
      <p>Jones, whose wife Tanya died earlier this year, added: "You've really helped me with my personal life bringing me onto this show, and I'll always be in debt to you."</p>
      <p>It comes a week after fans have threatened to boycott the show after Simon Cowell ignored Vinnie Jones' heartbreaking plea to leave.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media on Saturday evening, Twitter and Facebook users had their say as scores furiously threatened to boycott the show.</p>

      <p>Vinnie performed a version of Galway Shawl, and the former Chelsea and Wimbledon star told Simon, Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger that he had had a "fantastic time" but that he wanted to leave.</p>
      <p>Cowell, 60, refused to respect Vinnie's wishes as he landed in the bottom two with Kevin McHale.</p>
      <p>"It's been everything I needed since my wife passed," Vinnie admitted.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "A compete sham! @SimonCowell should of let @VinnieJones65 go with dignity after that gorgeous song from the heart! I respect Vinnie but heâ€™s no singer #CelebrityXFactor #vinniejones."</p>
