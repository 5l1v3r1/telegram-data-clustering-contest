      <p>LABELLE, Fla. (AP) – Two endangered Florida panthers have been found dead in as many days, bringing the total number of deaths this year to 26.</p>
      <p>The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says the remains of a 4-month-old female were collected last Thursday on a road running through Okaloacoochee Slough State Forest, and the remains of a 4-year-old male were collected last Wednesday west of Felda. Both were killed by vehicles.</p>
      <p>Florida panthers once roamed the entire Southeast, but now their habitat mostly is confined to a small region of Florida along the Gulf of Mexico. Up to 230 Florida panthers remain in the wild.</p>
