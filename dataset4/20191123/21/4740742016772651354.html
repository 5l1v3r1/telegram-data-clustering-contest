      <h1>Only Fools fans hit out at £375 tickets for pic with Del Boy</h1>
      <h2>Sir David Jason will be the star at an upcoming convention</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:15:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Antony Thrower, Andrew McQuarrie</a></address>
      <p>Fans of TV comedy show Only Fools and Horses, which was largely filmed in Bristol, have criticised the price charged to meet Sir David Jason at a charity event.</p>
      <p>The Sir David Jason and Friends exhibition, taking place in early 2020, offers the chance to receive an autograph from the Del Boy actor for £375.</p>
      <p>But some social media users have expressed their disappointment with the fee for the ticket, according to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/only-fools-horses-fans-furious-20939342">Daily Star</a> .</p>
      <p>Writing on the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/only-fools-and-horses">Only Fools</a> Appreciation Society’s Facebook page, one fan said: “Absolutely gutted! The ticket fee is completely out of my reach!!”.</p>
      <p>Another wrote: “Cheers for turning this into an elite day out.”</p>
      <p>The exhibition in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, offers entry for £55. However, fans will have to spend £255 or £375 for silver and gold packages that include a 'meet and greet' with Sir David in a mock-up of the Trotter Flat.</p>
      <p>The £375 package includes a photo with Sir David, as well as an in-person autograph.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale on Sunday (November 24) and donations will be gifted to Diabetes UK.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Star, a spokesman for the event said: “With the costs involved in delivering such a colossal event, tickets are never going to be cheap.</p>
      <p>“We have structured this so the best possible price is offered to the end user, whilst ensuring the charity greatly benefits from the donations by both the Society and Sir David.”</p>
