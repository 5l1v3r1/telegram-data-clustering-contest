      <h1>Aston Martini set to be shaken not stirred if it moves into 007 cocktail range</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:08:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/steve-bird/" target="_blank">Steve Bird</a></address>
      <p>For decades, the luxurious Aston Martin sports car has been as much a part of James Bond’s slick image as the spy’s favourite vodka martini, shaken not stirred.</p>
      <p>But now the British car manufacturer has obtained a trademark for its name and logo to be used for alcoholic drinks.</p>
      <p>The company has registered its winged Aston Martin badge for “alcoholic beverages”, including whisky, distilled spirits, liqueurs, wine and, perhaps inevitably, cocktails. </p>
      <p>However, while the official registration for the trademark embraces high class beverages likely to be drunk in upmarket casinos, it pointedly states that the logo should not be used for beer.</p>
      <p>It is the second time the British sports car manufacturer has traded in on its connections to Ian Fleming’s famous 007 character. </p>
      <p>A few years ago it put its name to a silver martini set, complete with two glasses (lined with 24k gold), two olive picks and a cocktail shaker, all with intricate cross hatching patterns reminiscent of the carbon fibre used on the most contemporary cars. Only 100 were produced, apparently justifying its price tag of nearly £8,000.</p>

      <p>Another company produced a sleek champagne case to fit snugly in the Aston Martin Milano’s trunk leaving little room for any luggage. </p>
      <p>However, the decision to protect the manufacturer’s name to be potentially used for alcoholic drinks has been met with caution by road safety campaigners.</p>
      <p>Joshua Harris, director of campaigns at<a href="http://www.brake.org.uk/"> Brake</a>, the road safety charity, said: “Drink driving is a serious issue on our roads, with the latest figures indicating that it is still the cause of around 250 deaths a year. </p>
      <p>“Driving brands must think and act responsibly and ensure that nothing they do encourages unsafe behaviour behind the wheel. </p>
      <p>“The current drink-driving limit gives a false impression that it is safe to drink and drive – this is a dangerous message and one that couldn’t be further from the truth.”  </p>
      <p>An Aston Martin<a href="https://www.astonmartin.com/en-gb/"> spokesman refused to say whether the company actually planned to produce or licence a drink or wh</a>ether it was simply ensuring others could not cash in on its brand. </p>
      <p>“We are very protective of the Aston Martin brand, and we are continually filing trademarks for the Aston Martin brand in various sectors to do this,” he said. </p>
      <p>The Bond character first appeared with a DB5 Aston Martin in the 1964 film Goldfinger. </p>
