      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> fans (and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a>) were left a bit baffled following Saturday night’s show after Nicole Sherzinger decided to vote off Try Star.</p>
      <p>Vinnie Jones, Try Star and V5 were all in the bottom three – with Vinnie being booted off by the public with the lowest amount of votes.</p>
      <p>Both bands then had to battle out in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>Making her decision, Nicole Scherzinger said: ‘This is so hard. Boys, I have so much respect for you. Girls, you know I love you and have loved you from day one. And I’m all about girl power.</p>
      <p>‘The act that I’m sending home is Try Star.’</p>
      <p>Whilst Simon Cowell added: ‘Wow, that was a surprise. Like I said earlier, it’s a popularity competition and a talent competition. Boys, in the weeks you had available and obviously given that you weren’t singers before, the progress is incredible. Girls, in seven days, you were put together, which is remarkable. If I’m judging it purely on what I call the real world, I have to send home Try Star.’</p>

      <p>With both judges opting to send home Try Star, Louis Walsh didn’t need to vote.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon </a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/louis-walsh/">Louis Walsh</a> put also Nicole on the spot on tonight’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/x-factor-celebritys-simon-cowell-louis-walsh-put-nicole-scherzinger-spot-confirm-romance-try-stars-thom-evans-11207751/">as they pretty much confirmed her romance with Try Star’s Thom Evans.</a></p>
      <p>Try Star opened the show on Saturday by singing The Greatest Show from the hit movie The Greatest Showman – and it was brilliant.</p>
      <p>Simon couldn’t help but smile as he gave Louis a wink before Nicole started commenting on the act.</p>
      <p>‘Oh my gosh this is the greatest show and that was the greatest way to open the show.’ she began.</p>
      <p>‘Three rugby players who turned out to be true showmen, gentlemen and you look like a million bucks.’</p>
      <p>Louis and Simon couldn’t help but add fuel to the fire as the Irishman added: ‘Nicole I agree with you but you love this act a lot, she sees something in this group that we don’t. She genuinely cares about them Simon.</p>

      <p>Simon continued: ‘I agree she is invested in the act, she likes the act.’</p>

      <p>It was recently reported that the 41-year-old Pussycat Dolls singer and the 34-year-old rugby star spent a romantic evening together, with insiders claiming that the pair flirted for weeks before the Try Star member plucked up the courage to ask her out.</p>
      <p>‘Thom is completely Nicole’s type,’ a source revealed. ‘And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.’</p>
      <p>The insider continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361248/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-thom-evans/">The Sun</a>: ‘And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner.’</p>
      <p>According to the source, Nicole and Thom initially met up for drinks as friends but want to see whether they could take their relationship to the next level once X Factor: Celebrity has wrapped.</p>
      <p>Thom is currently a contestant on the spin-off series and is a member of the band Try Star, alongside rugby internationals Ben Foden and Levi Davis.</p>
