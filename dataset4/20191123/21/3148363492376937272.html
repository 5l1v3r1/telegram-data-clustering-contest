      <h1>Anonymous Donor Gives 72 Acres of Land to Facility that Helps Disabled</h1>
      <h2>An anonymous donor in Savannah, Georgia, who felt very generous this holiday season gave 72 acres of land to a horseback riding facility that works with the disabled.</h2>

      <p>The group, Horsin’ Around, received the 72 acres from a Savannah businessman who preferred to stay unnamed, WJCL <a href="https://www.wjcl.com/article/horseback-riding-group-receives-72-acres-from-anonymous-businessman/29876015">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“We were looking, but not much out there we could afford. A realtor friend of mine put us in touch with a man who owns this property, and he had a heart for disabilities and offered us this land free and clear,” said Jill Stanberry, owner of Horsin’ Around.</p>
      <p>The organization — which has been around since the year 2000 — says it uses horseback riding to work with people who have physical and mental disabilities to help their setbacks that cannot be treated in a clinical setting, according to its <a href="http://www.horsinaround.org/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>A <i>Coastal Courier</i> <a href="https://coastalcourier.com/coastal-living/horseback-therapy-helps-people-with-disabilities/">report</a> from 2015 also noted that it is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that relies almost completely on volunteers.</p>
      <p>Employees say they are excited they can help more people with the additional land provided to them.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking about individuals who may not be able to walk or may not be able to walk normally, and we’re putting them on a horse that provides the movement of walking,” said Erin Dunn, certified therapy riding instructor for the group.</p>
      <p>“We lay them back on a horse, stretch everything open, stretch everything out, so they get that good posture, so they can breathe better, their heart and lungs work better, their digestive system works better,” she added.</p>
      <p>Horsin’ Around expects to have its expanded facilities operational by the end of next year.</p>
