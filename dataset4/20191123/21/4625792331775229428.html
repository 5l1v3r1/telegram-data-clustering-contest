      <p>A top Democrat said Republican Rep. Devin Nunes is likely to face an ethics investigation after he allegedly met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor to dig up dirt on President Trump’s rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>“Quite likely, without question,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith said Saturday on MSNBC's <i>AM Joy </i>when asked if Nunes could be investigated.</p>

      <p>A lawyer for Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, told CNN that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-associate-prepared-to-tell-congress-nunes-tried-to-get-dirt-on-biden-from-former-ukraine-official">Parnas is willing to tell Congress</a> about Nunes’ alleged efforts to obtain damaging information on Biden and his son Hunter’s dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee's top Republican, called the reporting “demonstrably false” and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/22/exclusive-devin-nunes-to-sue-cnn-daily-beast-over-fake-news-attacks/">threatened to sue</a> CNN and the Daily Beast.</p>
      <p>If the House Ethics Committee investigates the claims against Nunes, it would be the second time in as many years.</p>
      <p>The California Republican was cleared of revealing classified information to the White House related to his committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general that Nunes is claimed to have met with in Vienna last December, was ousted from his position in 2016 amid pressure from Western leaders. Biden was one of the leaders pushing for Shokin’s ouster.</p>
