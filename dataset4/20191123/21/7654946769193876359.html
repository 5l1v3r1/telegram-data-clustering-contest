      <h1>UWS residents losing sleep over MTA buses’ ‘saving lives’ warning</h1>

      <p>Upper West Siders are losing their latte over an automated bus alert intended to save lives.</p>
      <p>The pebble in the loafer is a robotic voice blaring “Caution, bus is turning” to pedestrians and bicyclists whenever the NYC Transit vehicles make a left- or right-hand turn. Approximately 1,200 of the 5,700 buses are equipped with the new technology, which cost $20 million.</p>
      <p>“It’s noise pollution, and our quality of life is deteriorating because of this,” fumed Jeff Weissman of West 72nd Street, who charges 72nd and West End is “ground zero” for the “24/7” safety messages that are “making life miserable.”</p>
      <p>Weissman griped that the alerts — which blast out of speakers mounted on the buses — are especially bad when he “wakes up in the morning to make coffee at 5:45” and “nobody’s out there!”</p>
      <p>For months, Weissman plastered “Help us … (or else)” flyers on neighborhood bus shelters and light poles imploring residents to call their community board and City Council member. “We can stop it now before they install it on every bus!” the flyer reads.</p>

      <p>“We get the crosstown 72nd, the crosstown 57, the M5 and every ‘out of service’ bus that comes down Riverside or up West End Avenue. They make a turn on 72nd Street. This is just the beginning!” he predicted.</p>
      <p>“Sleep and quietude are essential to our well-being,” chimed in Weissman’s neighbor, Alice, a meditation and yoga instructor, who added their building has “a number of new parents” who are already “sleep-deprived.” She suggested the city “explore other solutions.”</p>
      <p>Deborah G., a resident at 79th and West End Avenue, said she’s heard the alert from the ninth floor of her building and noticed the alert is triggered even when the bus is stopped at a red light. “It really needs to be recalibrated,” she said.</p>
      <p>NYC Transit first implemented the Pedestrian Turn Warnings in December 2016 as part of a pilot program in support of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s “Vision Zero” initiative, aimed at reducing traffic deaths.</p>
      <p>“The sound of that announcement all night long is loud and intrusive,” complained Janet Sullivan in a post on the West Side Rag, <a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2019/08/05/complaint-box-someone-really-dislikes-the-bus-turning-safety-announcements">which first reported the story</a>. Mark Friedman griped in his post that he can hear the announcement from his desk at 79th Street and Columbus Avenue “all day long” and in his dreams. “I don’t want people to get hurt, but there has to be a better way,” he said.</p>
      <p>A Post reporter and photographer camped out at the Columbus Avenue corner Wednesday afternoon could barely hear the alert, which did not always go off.</p>

      <p>In a Nov. 12 letter to Community Board 7, NYC Transit said the agency has twice adjusted the volume of the announcements to “ensure” street safety “while being minimally disruptive to the surrounding community.” The letter said it’s possible to further lower the volume setting by 15%, which is “well below the 10-decibel threshold allowed” by the city noise code.</p>
      <p>Commenter Lady Di clapped back at the noise on the noise: “The UWS seems to be rife with folks who have nothing to do all day but find things to complain about. Get a life.”</p>
