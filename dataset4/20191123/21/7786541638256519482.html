      <p><b>BETHEL PARK, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - Authorities are investigating the death of a man found on light rail tracks in western Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Allegheny County police say a Port Authority trolley operator spotted a man on the rails at the South Hills Village Station shortly before 6 a.m. Saturday. Police and emergency medical personnel responded, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The county medical examiner's office identified the man as 56-year-old Mark Setar of Canonsburg. Police said he "was likely struck" by a light rail train and was then spotted by the operator of the next train.</p>
      <p>Police say they don't know how the man came to be on the tracks. Port Authority and county police are reviewing video surveillance from the area. Anyone with information is asked to call investigators.</p>
