        <b>A GIRL of five has begged Nicola Sturgeon to help her best pal access cannabis oil to stop life-threatening fits.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lucy Park asked the First Minister to meet with the family of epileptic Cole Thomson, seven — and make ‘wonder drug’ Bedrolite available on the NHS.</p>

      <p>In a heartfelt letter, Lucy — who met her friend through a disabled kids footie team — wrote: “Cole was very sick and it made me really sad. When he takes his special medicine we can have lots of fun.</p>
      <p>“He was too poorly before.</p>
      <p>“I’d like Nicola to come to our tea party.</p>
      <p>"Then she would see how the medicine makes Cole and his mummy happy.</p>
      <p>“Please come and play with us.”</p>
      <p>We told how Bedrolite kept Cole, of East Kilbride, seizure-free for 224 days after ex-cop mum Lisa Quarrell, 38, smuggled it into Scotland from Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>The oil is not on a list of NHS drugs approved after rule changes by ministers last year.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesman said it was “open to discussing the situation” with the family.</p>
