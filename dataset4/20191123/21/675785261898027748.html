      <p>A top professor who beheaded his PhD student lover was overpowered when he grabbed a sword during a police crime scene reenactment.</p>
      <p>Oleg Sokolov has confessed to stabbing and dismembering 24-year-old Anastasia Yeschenko before disposing of her body parts in a river.</p>
      <p>The Napoleon expert was taken from his custody cell to his luxury St Petersburg flat to show detectives how he committed the murder as part of the criminal investigation.</p>
      <p>With his handcuffs off, the 63-year-old tried to grab the Napoleonic sword but was stopped by officers, law enforcement sources claim.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Alexander Pochuev said: “The defence can only confirm that he tried to commit suicide.</p>

      <p>“He was stopped by policemen.</p>
      <p>“There was no threat to third parties, the act was aimed only at himself.”</p>
      <p>He had been taken to the reenactment wearing a police helmet and bullet proof vest for his own protection.</p>
      <p>During the reenactment he demonstrated on a mannequin how he killed the PhD student and cut up her body using a saw.</p>
      <p>On Saturday the victim’s grieving mother claimed Anastasia had told Sokolov she was leaving him, which she believes this triggered his violent attack.</p>

      <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Galina Yeschenko said: “She just got fed up with total control by Sokolov, and she told him that she was leaving.”</p>
      <p>The mother told Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper she had earlier urged her daughter to leave a man old enough to be her grandfather.</p>
      <p>Mr Pochuev said Sokolov was ‘tormented” after shooting his lover four times and dismembering her body.</p>
      <p>“He repents,” the lawyer said.</p>

      <p>“He wants to apologise to the family, to the extent this is possible and wishes to correct the situation.”</p>
      <p>The lawyer claimed the killing may have happened because of a full moon.</p>
      <p>“It is a known medical fact that many schizophrenic debuts …happen this time,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sokolov is in custody pending the murder investigation.</p>
      <p>He faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted.</p>
