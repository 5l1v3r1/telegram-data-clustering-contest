      <p>The latest episode of NBC's<i> Saturday Night Live</i> featured a sketch about the most recent Democratic debate, featuring Melissa Villaseñor as Rachel Maddow.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got mom-hosting-Thanksgiving energy," said Kate McKinnon, reprising her Elizabeth Warren impression. "Come on, America, put a ring on it," she said later in the sketch.</p>
      <p>Former <i>SNL</i> castmember Maya Rudolph made a cameo as Kamala Harris. "I’m also America’s cool aunt," she said. "Mama needs a GIF." Later in the sketch, she made a reference to "Old Town Road."</p>
      <p>Colin Jost appeared as Pete Buttigieg, while Larry David reprised his impression of Bernie Sanders. "I’m doing better than ever," he said. "Doctors were surprised I made it."</p>
      <p>Former castmember Rachel Dratch made a cameo as Amy Klobuchar. "I got $17,000 from ex-boyfriends — all I had to do was threaten to come back in their lives," she said.</p>
      <p>Woody Harrelson also reprised his cameo as Joe Biden. "What I want you to know is you should be scared, because I’m always one second away from calling Cory Booker ‘Barack,'" he said.</p>
      <p>Chris Redd appeared as Booker in the sketch, while Bowen Yang played Andrew Yang, announcing that his vice president was the new Tesla truck.</p>
