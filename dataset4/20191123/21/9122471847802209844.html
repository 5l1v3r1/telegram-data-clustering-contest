      <h1>James Franklin Has Major Praise For Ohio State’s Crowd After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:51:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State head coach Ryan Day had a strong message for Buckeyes fans before kickoff against Penn State this afternoon. Day wanted Ohio Stadium to be rocking.</p>
      <p>“This place has to be a living hell today,” Day said. “Every time their offense touches the football, it has to be louder than the Horseshoe has been.”</p>
      <p>Ohio State fans got the message.</p>
      <p>Late in the game, when the Buckeyes’ defense needed their crowd the most, the fans were at their best. James Franklin said it was so loud inside Ohio Stadium, Penn State’s offense had to start guessing its cadence.</p>
      <p>Penn State had several missed snaps as a result.</p>

      <p>There’s being loud, and there’s being <i>so loud </i>that you prevent the opposing team from being able to snap the ball.</p>
      <p>Well done, Buckeyes fans.</p>
