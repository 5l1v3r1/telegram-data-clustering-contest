      <h1>Kansas’ comeback bid interrupted by Iowa State’s late surge in 41-31 loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:02:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Meredith</a></address>
      <p>AMES, Iowa — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/brock-purdy-2-player-stats">Brock Purdy</a> threw for 372 yards and four TDs and Iowa State rallied to beat <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/kansas-jayhawks-team">Kansas</a> 41-31 on Saturday and clinch its third straight winning season.</p>
      <p>La’Michael Pettway had 96 yards receiving and two touchdowns for the Cyclones (7-4, 5-3 Big 12), who’ve now complied three consecutive winning years just twice in the modern era.</p>
      <p>Iowa State, under coach Earle Bruce, won eight games each in 1976, 1977 and 1978 before Bruce bolted for Ohio State.</p>
      <p>But the Cyclones nearly blew it against the league’s last-place team as a 24-point favorite.</p>
      <p>Kansas (3-8, 1-7) scored two touchdowns in just 77 seconds late in the third quarter, the second coming after Purdy threw an interception, to jump ahead 24-21.</p>
      <p>Purdy responded with a 24-yard TD pass to Hall and a five-yard touchdown run with 5:10 left to put Iowa State back on top 34-31.</p>
      <p>After stopping Kansas on fourth down at the Iowa State 37, Purdy found <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/sean-shaw-player-stats">Sean Shaw</a> on 4th and goal from the four to seal the win with 1:09 to go.</p>
      <p>Carter Stanley threw for 328 yards and three TDs for Kansas, and Pooka Williams ran for 154 yards.</p>
      <p>THE BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Iowa State: The Cyclones’ defense, which has been really good for most of the season, had one of its worst games in years. Iowa State allowed 493 yards and nine third-down conversions.</p>
      <p>Kansas: The Jayhawks went for the ultimate gamble, going for it on 4th-down-and-5 with 4:18 left down 34-31. It didn’t work, as Stanley threw a ball over the middle and behind the sticks that Anthony Johnson swatted away.</p>
