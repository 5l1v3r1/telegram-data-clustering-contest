      <h1>HBO's Watchmen Is Better Than Snyder's Movie - But You Already Knew That</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:11:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Dominguez</a></address>
      <p>Director Zack Snyder's 2009 film adaptation of <i>Watchmen</i> -- the seminal DC Comics graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons -- is an interesting piece of media to discuss, to say the least. Depending on who you ask, it is either an underrated masterpiece of superhero cinema or a colossal trainwreck that is better off forgotten. In reality, however, it's really neither of these extremes. Rather, it is a movie that can best be described as "just okay."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, HBO's new <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/watchmen-tv/">Watchmen</a> television series -- developed by <i>Lost</i> co-creator Damon Lindelof -- is an absolutely fantastic piece of television thus far. And with the series' first (<a href="https://www.cbr.com/hbo-watchmen-nine-episode-single-season-story/">and perhaps only</a>) season now more than halfway through, it's rather obvious -- especially to fans of the original comic -- that this new on-screen depiction of <i>Watchmen</i> is superior to its predecessor, even if it is definitely more of a sequel than an adaptation (or a "remix," as Lindelof puts it).</p>

      <p>Credit where it's due, there is a lot to like about 2009's <i>Watchmen</i>. First and foremost, the cast fantastic, with Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach alone more than making the film worth the watch. Furthermore, it's clear a lot of love went into recreating Gibbons' most iconic panels from the '80s comic book as faithfully as possible -- which, on principle, is pretty admirable. However, therein lies one of the film's biggest problems: While Snyder undeniably loves <i>Watchmen</i>, he also doesn't really seem to get <i>Watchmen</i>.</p>

      <p>Snyder's film is so concerned with meticulously translating the comic's art to live-action -- as well as crafting elaborate fight sequences and an overlong sex scene -- that the actual intellect and political commentary also present in the comic are woefully underrepresented on-screen. And saying that isn't exactly a stretch, given a quote from the director himself.</p>

      <p>"You could call it 'high-brow' comics, but to me, that comic book [<i>Watchmen</i>] was just pretty sexy," Snyder said in a 2008 interview with <a href="https://ew.com/article/2008/07/17/watchmen-chat-director-zack-snyder/">Entertainment Weekly</a> -- nine months before <i>Watchmen</i>'s theatrical release. "I had a buddy who tried getting me into 'normal' comic books, but I was all like, 'No one is having sex or killing each other. This isn’t really doing it for me.' I was a little broken, that way. So when <i>Watchmen</i> came along, I was, 'This is more my scene.'"</p>
      <p>Moore and Gibbons' <i>Watchmen</i> is a deeply political work. In fact, part of what made the graphic novel so impactful was its political urgency. It tackled hot button political issues -- namely the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union -- as they were developing in real-time. If you read <i>Watchmen</i> as it was first coming out in the '80s, you likely got the impression Moore and Gibbons were holding up a mirror to our society -- and were being rather unapologetic about that fact.</p>

      <p>The film is also set during the 1980s. But this is where obsessive fidelity to the source material ultimately fails the movie. As a period piece, Snyder's <i>Watchmen</i> completely lacks the political urgency the graphic novel had. Because by the time the film hit theaters in 2009, the Cold War had already been over for close to 20 years. Combine that with Snyder's creative priorities clearly being elsewhere, and you're left with a film that -- while well-acted and aesthetically pleasing -- doesn't really have anything to say.</p>
      <p>This is where HBO's <i>Watchmen</i> proves itself to be more worthy of its name. Regardless of your opinions regarding his answers to interview questions, it's clear Lindelof, at the very least, understands how political and complex Moore and Gibbons' text is. Furthermore, he also understands that for his series to be as biting as the original comic, a change of scenery (and time period) was necessary.</p>

      <p>By being set in the present-day, the television series is able to address the sociopolitical topics that actually matter to people in 2019. From the resurgence of white supremacy, to the dubious ethics being employed by law enforcement officials, to the general sense of domestic unease, <i>Watchmen</i> once again feels like a reflection of our current reality.</p>

      <p>What's more, while the <i>Watchmen</i> film boasts a phenomenal cast bringing its characters to life, so too does the HBO series. Plus, Lindelof and his collaborators seem to understand something about the source material that Snyder doesn't: its characters are not to be admired.</p>
      <p>Another instance of Snyder's vision being diametrically opposed to Moore's is the fact that while Snyder clearly loves <i>Watchmen</i>'s characters, Moore was far less fond of them. Moore wanted you to see what terrible or otherwise flawed people <i>Watchmen</i>'s "heroes" were, whereas Snyder bent over backward to make those very same characters seem "cool."</p>

      <p>Take, for instance, Rorschach. Snyder's film tries to make the character come off as a rough-around-the-edges antihero, be it through intricate action set pieces or unironically indulging his melodramatic monologues. Meanwhile, Lindelof's TV series is much quicker to acknowledge the hard facts that were established by Moore and Gibbons: Rorschach is not only a murderous psychopath but also a reactionary extremist who subscribes to newspapers that defend the Ku Klux Klan. And while fictional characters should never be blamed for the actions or beliefs of real-life people, it's not exactly hard to see Rorschach inspiring a new white supremacist movement -- the 7th Cavalry -- in-universe.</p>
      <p>HBO's <i>Watchmen</i>, on an objective level, is top-tier TV. It features great performances by a stellar cast, immersive visuals, as well as an enthralling narrative that leaves viewers clambering for the next episode. But what makes it a better <i>Watchmen</i> than Snyder's version is the fact that, as a modern take on the beloved graphic novel, it's a series that does just about everything right.</p>

      <p>While Alan Moore himself wants nothing to do with the series (same as all adaptations of his work), the team behind HBO's 2019 version of <i>Watchmen</i> seem to have a rather strong grasp on his and Gibbons' politically-charged perspective when the comic's universe was first built. They also know when to remain faithful and when to deviate, changing the setting and focus characters in order to be relevant in the 21st century, while also rooting itself in the comic's canon -- in some cases even adapting things the movie didn't, such as the infamous squid.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On a visual level, the 2009 film version is arguably the perfect adaptation of <i>Watchmen </i>-- with some strong performances to boot. On a philosophical level, however, Snyder's <i>Watchmen</i> completely misses the mark. It offers little to no contemporarily relevant commentary and revels in the violence, melodrama and toxic character traits the comic's creators wanted readers to cringe at. As such, the film averages out to be -- as said before -- "just okay."</p>

      <p>To those who not only read but also genuinely understood what Moore and Gibbons' <i>Watchmen</i> was trying to communicate, it should be obvious that the television series -- in addition to being well-crafted -- has a much stronger grasp on the themes and spirit of its source than the film did.</p>
