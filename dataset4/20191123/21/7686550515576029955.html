      <h1>Wales star Gareth Bale was just subjected to ferocious booing by Real Madrid fans</h1>
      <h2>It was Bale's first appearance for the club since October 5</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:41:26+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale was ferociously booed by Real Madrid fans on his return to the club following the international break.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old played twice for Wales during the recent international break, helping them to qualify for Euro 2020 with wins over Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>It came after the Welshman failed to play a single minute of action for the Spanish giants after suffering a calf problem late on in Wales' 1-1 draw with Croatia in Cardiff last month.</p>
      <p>He felt the wrath of the Spanish media for dancing with the now iconic <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-euro-2020-gareth-bale-17284390">"Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order." flag</a> after Wales' stunning <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-qualify-for-euro-2020-17276617">2-0 triumph over Hungary</a> on Tuesday night, a result that ensured Ryan Giggs' men will be playing in next year's summer tournament.</p>

      <p>And Bale was roundly booed as he was brought off the bench during Real Madrid's La Liga clash with Real Sociedad on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Bale - who was also jeered when warming up on the sidelines - replaced Rodrygo in the 66th minute of the game at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Some sections of supporters were seen applauding in support of Wales' talisman, however, the vast majority appeared to be voicing their discontent following recent events, with some jeering each time Bale touched the ball.</p>
      <p>Within minutes of coming off the bench, Bale helped to create his side's third goal.</p>
      <p>After the Welsh ace missed several weeks of action, former Real Madrid player Predrag Mijatovic criticised the Cardiff-born star's love of golf.</p>

      <p>In a column for Spanish media outlet AS, he wrote: "The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid."</p>
      <p>It went on to become a new chant, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/genius-new-gareth-bale-chant-17269089">with the Red Wall belting out "Wales. Golf. Madrid."</a> to the tune of Viva Gareth Bale during the wins against Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>The slogan was also stuck on to a flag that managed to find its way on to the pitch after the historic win against Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the international break, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/gareth-bale-zinedine-zidane-press-17300185">Bale's club boss Zinedine Zidane said:</a> "I think we do a lot of things and make a lot of noise about Bale and the most important thing for me as a coach and for him as a player is to concentrate on football.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has their own opinion and it's one thing that's already too much.</p>
      <p>"You know the situation, he's been with the national team, he's been able to play and now he's with us.</p>
      <p>"He's given a lot to the club and I'm only going to look at sports because outside there are a lot of comments and I'm not here for that. I know a lot of people are interested, but I'm not."</p>
