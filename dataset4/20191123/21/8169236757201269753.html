        <b>I think we all knew that the Wales flag with the Wales-golf-Madrid message on it would get a bit of attention back in Spain.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It certainly looks like his actions were seen as disrespectful by some of the Spanish press. Obviously we must forget that they’ve spent months trying to force Bale out of Madrid.</p>

      <p>It also looks like the fans have taken it badly. Bale has been getting booed at The Bernabeu tonight and this banner has been spotted in the crowd:</p>

      <p>There really is nothing like a football fan being scorned to bring out their petty sides. Despite that, we all know they will turn again if he starts to score and play well and decide he’s a hero yet again.</p>
      <p>But for now, it seems the Real Madrid faithful will pretend they would rather see Lucas Vazquez play instead of him.</p>
