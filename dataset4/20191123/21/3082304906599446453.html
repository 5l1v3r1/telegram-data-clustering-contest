      <p>“It was a very easy decision because I feel very good here,” Moutinho told Wolves’ official club website. “It’s a big club that wants to do something good and I want to do my best to help.</p>
      <p>“We did a great job last season and this season we’ll try to do better. That’s what we’re going to do and I’m going to try 100 per cent to help the club to improve.</p>
      <p>“I feel very good. We won today, a very important win, and I signed a new contract. I’m very happy to help the team today and I hope to help the new for the new two, three years.”</p>
