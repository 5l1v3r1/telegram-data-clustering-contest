      <h4>Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley, and newcomer Sutton Stracke all posed with crowns at an event as they appeared to reference Lisa Vanderpump’s tagline from season 7!</h4>
      <p>Is <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/kyle-richards/"><b>Kyle Richards</b></a>, 50, throwing shade at her former BFF <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/lisa-vanderpump"><b>Lisa Vanderpump</b></a>, 59? It sure seems like it with her latest Instagram post! In the pic, Kyle poses with <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/dorit-kemsley/"><b>Dorit Kemsley</b></a>, 43, and <b>Sutton Stracke</b>, as all three sport crowns featuring a floral motif. “If the crown fits , wear it 👑,” Kyle captioned the fun photo, which features the ladies posing in a Dolce &amp; Gabbana store in Rome, Italy on Friday, Nov. 22. The photo appears to be a dig at LVP, who previously had the tagline, “The crown is heavy, darlings. So just leave it where it belongs” in season seven. At last season’s reunion, <b>Erika Girardi</b>, 48, also bestowed the title on Kyle, who is an OG housewife. “She is the queen,” Erika stated to <b>Andy Cohen</b>. “Not only is she the original, but she’s the leader of the group. ..Because she is the one we are all connected to, she binds us together.”</p>
      <p>Dorit also posted a video of the trio posing in the crowns, writing, “Outta my way ladies 😂👑@kylerichards18 @suttonstracke @dolcegabbana” as she jokingly pushed them out of the way. Dorit, of course, has her own beef with Lisa after the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/07/31/lisa-vanderpump-accused-kyle-richards-leaking-puppygate-story-rhobh-creature/">#Puppygate scandal</a> which involved Dorit adopting a puppy from Lisa’s Vanderpump Dogs organization then later gave Lucy — the dog — away. Kyle was later <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/07/30/rhobh-kyle-richards-cries-lisa-vanderpump-friendship-reunion-recap/">dragged into the drama</a> after Lisa accused her friend of leaking details about the drama to the press, and the situation was one of many that appeared to influence Lisa’s decision to leave <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> after nine seasons. Dorit’s husband <b>Paul “PK” Kemsley</b> also got in on the IG action, commenting “Clearly wasn’t that heavy …🤣” on Kyle’s photo, seemingly throwing some <i>additional</i> shade at LVP.</p>
      <p>Drama aside, the ladies looked chic for the outing at the luxury retailer: Kyle and Sutton twinned in sexy leather leggings, which Kyle paired with a black pair of sneakers featuring a hint of the classic Louis Vuitton monogram, a fitted black turtleneck and a classic tweed blazer. Sutton added a pop of color to her ensemble with the Spike Sock Red Sole Sneakers by Christian Louboutin, while Dorit gave us all the fashion week vibes in a timeless black Burberry trench, Fendi monogram tights and a black patent boots.</p>
