      <p>Kolkata - <b>India's Cheteshwar Pujara</b> said on Saturday that the pink ball and the lights played a role in four <b>Bangladesh </b>batsmen being hit on the helmet during the first day-night Test in for both teams.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma led an inspired Indian pace attack that left Bangladesh reeling at 152 for six, needing another 89 runs to avoid an innings defeat at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh lost Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan on Friday to possible concussion. On Saturday, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mohammad Mithun survived hits.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur survived a blow to his helmet by an Umesh Yadav bouncer but managed to stay unbeaten on 59 and take the five-day game to day three.</p>
      <p>Mithun was hit by Yadav but batted on only to fall for six to the same bowler.</p>
      <p>"I thought the light and the pink ball had a role to play because as a batsman, it is not easy to pick the ball, especially the short balls," Pujara, who earlier made 55 in India's first innings of 347 for nine declared, told reporters.</p>
      <p>"As far as I know, they haven't even played any first-class game with the pink ball. So it's not easy."</p>
      <p>Mehidy Hasan and Taijul Islam took the places of Liton and Nayeem who were both hit on the helmet by Mohammed Shami on day one.</p>
      <p>Pujara batted under lights in the final session of the opening day, putting on 94 runs with skipper Virat Kohli who made a dominant 136.</p>
      <p>"Batting under lights was difficult when I batted yesterday. I think the first session is easier to bat because there are no lights," said Pujara.</p>
      <p>"When there are lights, the ball starts swinging a little more. So it is a bit challenging."</p>
      <p>Pujara also said that India's spinners made the SG pink ball turn more than the Australian Kookaburra which was used in a few Indian domestic matches.</p>
