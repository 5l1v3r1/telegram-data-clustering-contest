      <p>New Wallaby coach Dave Rennie will be no pushover for the people who appointed the Kiwi, warns one of the men who knows him best.</p>
      <p>Australian rugby has already been torn apart by a rift between its head coach and chief executive.</p>
      <p>The departed Michael Cheika and Rugby Australia’s chief executive Raelene Castle fell out before and during the World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>Rennie, who won two <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> titles at the Chiefs, has been appointed by Castle’s administration to turn the Wallabies around.</p>
      <p>New Zealand coaching legend Wayne Smith was Rennie’s assistant and mentor at the Chiefs, and says he is a very loyal but direct man.</p>

      <p>“He’s prepared to put himself in the gun sights of those above him to fight for what he thinks is right,” Smith told the Sun-Herald.</p>
      <p>Smith, an assistant to two of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a>’ World Cup winning coaches, expects <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> to become an attack orientated side under Rennie.</p>
      <p>He described him as “relentless, unwavering, loyal.”</p>
      <p>“He’ll take no prisoners, ” Smith said.</p>
      <p>“He will be relentless in his pursuit of excellence and expects all around him to be the same.</p>

      <p>“Rens expects loyalty and trust then gives it back in spades.</p>
      <p>“He is unwavering in his commitment to attack. Players will have to lose their conservative ideas and be open to myriad possibilities of how to use the ball in a positive and logical way.</p>
      <p>“Even behind their own goal line, if opportunities present themselves, you’d better take them.”</p>
      <p>Smith also believes Rennie’s Rarotongan heritage will play a significant part in his approach.</p>
      <p>“Rens will want the team to connect with their past and the community, to show gratitude, to build their grit and resilience,” Smith says.</p>

      <p>“He understands the need for huge personal meaning as part of a winning mindset…he is a supporter of diversity and he stands up for his people and program if he thinks it’s right.”</p>
      <p>The Sun-Herald also quotes former All Black pivot Andrew Mehrtens saying: “You don’t find anyone in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> who says a bad word about him.</p>
      <p>“He stays out of the limelight, he wants to get in and do his job and do it as well as possible. He’ll pull together a group of guys and put his passion into it and wants them to get a good experience out of it. He’ll absolutely throw everything he can into the Wallabies.</p>
      <p>“He’s coached alongside the man I’ve probably got the most respect for in rugby, Wayne Smith, and Smithy can’t speak more highly of the guy.”</p>
      <p>And former All Black No. 8 Murray Mexted described Rennie as “a great appointment for Australian rugby”.</p>
