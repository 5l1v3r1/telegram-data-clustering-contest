      <h3>‘Avengers: Endgame’ Writers Explain Why There Was No ‘Iron Man 4’</h3>

      <p>A fourth <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/iron-man"><i>Iron Man</i></a> film had been rumored for years, even before the revelation of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a>. <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/robert-downey-jr">Robert Downey Jr.</a> had portrayed the genius/billionaire since 2008 and only had three solo flicks within 11 years of <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> films. There was definitely another time to sneak a fourth <i>Iron Man</i> flick into the MCU, and it certainly would have made hundreds of millions, probably crossing the billion-dollar mark. It turns out there’s a reason the studio decided to pass on <i>Iron Man 4</i>, and the <i>Endgame</i> writers are explaining why, and it’s because it was time to take chances on new characters and other franchises.</p>
      <p>Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have been talking all things <i>Endgame</i> since it’s premiere in April. They recently expanded on why<i> Iron Man 4</i> didn’t happen, no matter how badly fans were hoping for it. <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">Vanity Fair</a></i> caught up with the writers, who said that any other studio probably would have made a fourth film, but they decided against it.</p>
      <blockquote>“Whether you like all of the 24 movies or not, the capital that Marvel built up allowed them to do things like make a movie starring a raccoon and a tree, right? You would’ve already had <i>Iron Man 4</i> if it was any other studio. But they decided, ‘No, we’re going to take chances on all these other things.’ To put a flag in the ground and say, We’re going to end something and take characters off the table, is, I think, kind of daring, but selfishly it was really great for us.”</blockquote>

      <p><i>Iron Man 3</i> debuted in 2013, giving the studio six years to make another solo film if they wanted to. There wasn’t even an <i>Iron Man</i> film in Phase 3, which differed from other characters and their own films including Thor and Captain America.</p>

      <p>McFeely and Markus also noted that the studio knew they were going to kill off Tony Stark “years before <i>Endgame</i>.” This also put a nail in the coffin for an <i>Iron Man 4</i> film after the events of <i>Endgame</i>, which was another rumor fans put a lot of hope into.</p>
      <p>“If Tony made it out the other side, and <i>Iron Man 4</i> was waiting there, you’d be like, [shakes head] One too many…” Markus continued.</p>
      <p>According to the writers, there needed to be an end for Tony Stark, and it especially had to have meaning behind it. Iron Man’s arc was definitely completed in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> when he single-handedly saved billions of lives by sacrificing himself. Downey had also previously mentioned earlier this year that he knew it was time to <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5611017/robert-downey-jr-said-he-knew-he-had-to-get-off-the-bus-with-marvel/">get off the Marvel bus</a>, and he may not have been receptive to a fourth <i>Iron Man</i> after <i>Endgame</i> if it was even offered to him.</p>
