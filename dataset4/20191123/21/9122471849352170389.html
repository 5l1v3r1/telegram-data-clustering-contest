      <h1>Photo: The Crowd For Today’s Vanderbilt Game Is Just Sad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:41:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Late November games can either bring out sold out stadiums or poor crowd attendance. What makes the difference? It typically comes down to the team’s success and the opponent.</p>
      <p>If a team is competing for a spot in the College Football Playoff, it doesn’t matter who the opponent is – the stadium’s going to be full. But if a team isn’t competing for bowl eligibility whatsoever, good luck bringing out a decent crowd.</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt is facing plenty of issues this season. The Commodores are just 2-8 with wins over Missouri and Northern Illinois. It’s been an abysmal season so far. And today’s crowd attendance at Vanderbilt Stadium is making life a bit gloomier.</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt is playing East Tennessee State this afternoon and the fans aren’t exactly thrilled about the contest. Check out this picture of the crowd attendance at the Commodores’ game.</p>

      <p>Yikes. But this is what happens when SEC schools schedule such poor opponents in late November.</p>
      <p>These late November non-conference games against inferior opponents are an unfortunate causation of the current playoff format. The SEC is so highly regarded teams from the conference are able to get away with scheduling easy opponents late in the year.</p>
      <p>If Vanderbilt and the SEC hopes to improve its crowds in late November, scheduling more interesting contests would be helpful.</p>
