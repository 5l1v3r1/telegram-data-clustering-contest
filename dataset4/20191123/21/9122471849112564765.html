      <p>Every week there’s a fan in college football that goes viral for something out of the ordinary. While there are most likely multiple fans that have gone viral this afternoon, none top the Alabama fan that showcased a series of dance moves at Bryant-Denny Stadium.</p>
      <p>Senior day was a success for Alabama as it destroyed Western Carolina. Honestly, the game was over before it even began.</p>
      <p>With the game well out of reach in the second half, one fan decided to display her dancing skills for the rest of the world to see.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the broadcast crew at ESPN caught her moves on camera.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>Those are definitely some interesting dance moves from this fan.</p>
      <p>Alabama ended up winning 66-3 over Western Carolina.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Crimson Tide is their annual matchup against the Auburn Tigers. Maybe next week we’ll see a dancing fan go viral at Jordan-Hare Stadium.</p>
