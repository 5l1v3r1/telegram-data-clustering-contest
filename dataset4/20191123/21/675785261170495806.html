      <h1>Labour will let football fans vote on who manager is - and block unpopular choices</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Under Labour proposals, at least two club director spots will be saved for accredited supporters' trusts and the board members will be chosen by ballot</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:18:26+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Chris McLaughlin</a></address>
      <p>Labour has vowed to give footie fans a say on who scores the manager’s job at their beloved clubs.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a raft of measures intended to ensure ­supporters’ views are represented in all key decisions on how our major sides are run.</p>
      <p>And it could help clubs avoid unpopular decisions like the recent appointment of former Chelsea and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> manager Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur – which ­powerless fans would have loved to be able to red-card.</p>
      <p>Under <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> proposals, at least two club director spots will be reserved for accredited ­supporters’ trusts and the board members will be chosen by ballots of signed-up fans.</p>
      <p>They will get full voting rights on equal status with other commercially appointed members.</p>
      <p>Shadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: “Labour will put fans at the heart of football by giving them a far greater say over the way clubs are run.</p>

      <p>“We will give them a voice over who the manager is.”</p>
      <p>Under the bid to overhaul ­footie club governance and ownership, supporters’ trusts would also be allowed to buy block shares when clubs change hands – bringing the ­possibility of securing more board places.</p>
      <p>Other aspects of the Labour package include a Fan’s Fare scheme under which supporters would get cash for travel paid back if matches are changed for the ­benefit of broadcasters.</p>
      <p>And new regulations would cover safe standing areas with decisions made jointly by fans, club management and safety authorities.</p>
      <p>Proposals also include a guarantee that the Premier League will be legally ­required to invest five per cent of income from TV rights in the grassroots game to help new generations of players and coaches, and to improve facilities and pitches.</p>
      <p>And reviled zero-hour contracts will be banned, preventing the exploitation of ground workers whose loyalty is used to undermine wages.</p>

      <p>And reviled zero-hour contracts will be banned, preventing the exploitation of ground workers whose loyalty is used to undermine wages.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, women’s football and the Paralympics will be added to the list of key sporting events required to be broadcast on free-to-air TV.</p>
      <p>The plans come after the ­fan-based model of footie club ownership has already proved a success on the Continent.</p>
      <p>In Germany, a majority of club shares must be owned by followers.</p>
      <p>Ticket prices are low and the stadiums are full – with safe standing.</p>
      <p>Barcelona is owned by 180,000 fans who pay £140 a year and have the right to elect the club president every four years.</p>
