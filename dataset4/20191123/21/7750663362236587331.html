      <h1>Real Madrid to beat Barcelona to Dani Olmo deal?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> are reportedly weighing up a move for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/dinamo-zagreb/"><b>Dinamo Zagreb</b></a> attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dani-olmo/"><b>Dani Olmo</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 21-year-old has enjoyed a productive start to the season for Dinamo, scoring six times and registering six assists in 18 appearances during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>The Croatian club are seemingly facing a battle to keep hold of the Spain international, though, with a number of clubs credited with an interest.</p>
      <p>Manchester City and Juventus are two teams to be linked with a move, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/messi-wants-barcelona-to-re-sign-olmo_379830.html">also thought</a> to be keen on bringing the attacker back to Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>However, according to reports in Spain, Madrid are now in the race for the Spaniard, and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s side are determined to beat their Clasico rivals to his signature either in January or at the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Olio, who scored on his senior international debut against Malta on November 15, has a contract at Stadion Maksimir until the end of the 2020-21 campaign.</p>
