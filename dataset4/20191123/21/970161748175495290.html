      <p>Sainsbury’s has doubled the price of its plastic bags to 20p and shoppers are furious.</p>
      <p>The supermarket said the move was part of its drive to halve plastic use within five years, with profits going to good causes.</p>
      <p>They said the price rise was ‘fair’, but angry shoppers were quick to vent their frustrations on social media.</p>
      <p>One called it ‘daylight robbery’ while another questioned why the grocer didn’t offer paper bags rather than ‘profiteering from my forgetfulness’.</p>
      <p>A third commented: ‘You’re right, you will cut Sainsbury’s plastic consumption as I won’t be shopping there anymore.’</p>
      <p>Sainsbury’s scrapped single use carrier bags back in 2015 after the government imposed a 5p charge.</p>

      <p>Tesco have kept theirs at 10p.</p>
      <p>A Sainsbury’s spokesperson told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10404153/sainsburys-fury-doubling-price-plastic-bags-20p/">The Sun</a>: ‘We think 20p is fair. We’re really hoping it will help reduce our plastic usage.’</p>
      <p>In September they removed plastic bags from the bakery, fruit and veg aisles and replaced them with a 30p drawstring carrier.</p>
