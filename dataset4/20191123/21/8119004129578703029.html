        <b>Jewellers in Bangladesh have raised gold prices, taking the best quality of the yellow metal beyond Tk 58,000 per Bhori again after two and a half months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bangladesh Jewellers Samity announced the new prices on Saturday, with a jump of up to Tk 1,666 a Bhori (11.664 grams).<br/><br/>Gold prices increased in the local bullion market due to the taka’s devaluation against the dollar leading the association to raise the prices, according to a statement.<br/><br/>“It’s true that gold prices dropped by $10 an ounce in the international market. But we had to raise the prices to stop smuggling as prices have been raised in India,” the association’s President Enamul Haque Khan told bdnews24.com.<br/><br/><b>From Sunday, gold prices per Bhori will be:</b><br/><br/>22 carat – Tk 58,028<br/><br/>21 carat – Tk 55,696<br/><br/>18 carat – Tk 50,680<br/><br/>For the traditional method, in which gold is acquired from old ornaments but there is no standard of purity, the price remains unchanged at Tk 29,160 per Bhori.<br/><br/>Silver price has also been kept unchanged at Tk 933 per Bhori.<br/><br/>Jewellers raised gold prices four times in August before cutting once in September.</p>
