      <p>Tyler Perry’s heart just keeps getting bigger as he just helped a couple that wasn’t allowed to leave a Mexican hospital after not being able to pay the bill.</p>
      <p>Tori Austin and her fiance, Stephen Johnson, were on a cruise when Johnson fell ill with pancreatitis, diabetes and a kidney infection reports<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/tyler-perry-help-sick-man-mexico-hospital-medical-bills-cruise/"><i> TMZ</i></a>. They ended up in Centro Medico Americano in Progreso in the Yucatan where he was treated.</p>

      <p>However, the couple was told they couldn’t leave until they paid the $14,000 bill which included dialysis. They started a GoFundMe page but it didn’t even come close to covering the hospital bill.</p>
      <p>After their story was on the local news, it caught the attention of mega-producer Perry who stepped in. He reportedly tried to pay over the phone with a credit card but was told he would have to wire money instead which should arrive this Monday.</p>

      <p>At this point, Johnson will be released on Tuesday but doctors were concerned a medevac plane would be needed. Another item that Perry offered to pay for.</p>
      <p><i>ET Canada</i> has reached out to Perry’s rep for a comment.</p>
      <p>Perry is known for lending a helping hand including sending his<a href="https://etcanada.com/news/501237/tyler-perry-using-his-personal-seaplane-to-fly-desperately-needed-supplies-to-hurricane-stricken-bahamas/"> personal plane</a> to bring aid to the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian.</p>
