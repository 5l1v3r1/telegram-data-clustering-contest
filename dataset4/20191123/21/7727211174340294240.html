      <p>It's been a tough week in the Australian jungle and tonight one of the I'm A Celebrity camp mates broke down and threatened to quit the show.</p>
      <p>Tonight saw James Haskell voted leader <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-winner-toff-tears-17304573">of the camp,</a> with Jacqueline Jossa as his deputy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/ian-wright-takes-swipe-jacqueline-17304142">In the episode</a> Jacqueline and James were sat on their comfy beds in the Leaders Cabin and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/andrew-maxwell-sparks-health-concern-17304165">Andrew came up</a> to them to chat.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Andrew said: “I was up in the Leaders Cabin, I was chatting to James and Jacqueline and I was just so tired, I just hit a wall.”</p>

      <p>James went for a shower and Andrew sat on his bed.</p>
      <p>He turned to Jacqueline and said: “I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say ‘have I done the right thing’.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said: “You’d never leave, I can tell that, you’re just tired.”</p>

      <p>Andrew began to cry, when James came back and asked if he was OK and Jacqueline said that Andrew was tired.</p>
      <p>James said: “Everyone has a bad day” as Jacqueline hugged Andrew and said: “He’s been sleeping on the floor, he’s had six nights on the floor.”</p>
      <p>James said: “You’re an important part of the group and we need you.”</p>

      <p>James and Jacqueline advised him to eat some food in the form of beans.</p>
      <p>Andrew said: “I’m just so tired.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said: “You’ve spent over two weeks away from your family, it’s a long time.”</p>
      <p>Andrew said: “I’m just a little bit overwhelmed right now.”</p>
      <p>And James encouraged him and said: “You’re brilliant, you bring so much energy and laughter.”</p>
      <p>James then said he’d look after him in the camp.</p>
