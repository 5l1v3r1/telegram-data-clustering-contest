      <p>Mount Athos, also known as the Holy Mountain in Greece, is one of the most sacred spots on earth and ‘My Greek Odyssey’ gives audiences an exclusive look into the spiritual capital of the Orthodox Christian world.</p>
      <p>In the peninsula of Halkidiki, Northern Greece, only men are permitted to enter Mount Athos. The 20 monasteries and all monks are under the guide of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>
      <p>On this episode of ‘My Greek Odyssey’ the host, Greek Australian Peter Maneas is accompanied by Father Gerasimos, the parish priest at St George Greek Orthodox Church in Rose Bay, Sydney.</p>
      <p>As well as taking viewers to Mount Athos, “a place full of spiritual commitment and dedication to the spiritual life”, Father Gerasimos reunited with his brother who he hasn’t seen in five years as he is a monk there.</p>
      <p>As Peter Maneas once said “Being of Greek heritage myself, I just love Greece so much.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve been travelling there since I was 10 years old. I spent six months living there when I was a child and it changed my life. Over the years, whenever my wife and I visited, she’d take little videos of me where I’d describe the sights. That gave me the idea to put together a show where I could share all these amazing places that I love to visit with other people,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Don’t be mistaken in thinking My Greek Odyssey is just another travel show – this journey is far from ordinary!</p>
