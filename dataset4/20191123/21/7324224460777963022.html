      <p>Strictly Come Dancing viewers were left scratching their heads after Craig Revel Horwood doled out a handful of low scores on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The judge, known for often being difficult to please, gave four points to Alex Scott and Neil Jones for their Argentine tango when the other judges scored them sevens and an eight.</p>
      <p>The couple ended up at the bottom of the leaderboard with 26 points alongside Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard.</p>

      <p>Host Claudia Winklemen poked fun at the judge’s scoring during the episode, asking someone to “give Craig some chocolate”.</p>
      <p>BBC Breakfast host Dan Walker was among those sharing their disbelief at Revel Horwood’s score of four.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: “Can we use VAR on @AlexScott’s Argentine tango with @Mr_NJones? That 4 from Craig is a low blow. Feel like Al needs a hug ?? #Strictly @bbcstrictly #StrictlyComeDancing2019</p>
