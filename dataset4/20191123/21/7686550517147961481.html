      <h1>Injury worry over new Wales squad member Willis Halaholo as he is helped from field</h1>
      <h2>The Cardiff Blues centre hurt his knee during the Euro clash with Leicester</h2>

      <p>New Wales squad member Willis Halaholo has suffered an injury blow just days after being called up by Wayne Pivac.</p>
      <p>The Cardiff Blues centre had to be helped from the field at the Arms Park tonight after hurting his knee during the first half of the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-leicester-live-score-17306224">Challenge Cup clash with Leicester.</a></p>
      <p>It’s an untimely setback for the Kiwi-born 29-year-old, who was called up to the Wales set-up for the first time last Tuesday after recently qualifying on the three-year residency rule.</p>
      <p>He would have been in with a good shout of featuring against the Barbarians next Saturday, as he’s one of only three centres in new coach Pivac’s 35-strong squad.</p>
      <p>But now his participation in that match must be in some doubt, although he was able to walk down the tunnel at half-time, which offers hope that it's not too serious a problem.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, Blues head coach John Mulvihill said: "Willis took a bit of a knock on the knee.</p>
      <p>"He is icing it. Hopefully he will be okay."</p>
      <p>Halaholo had been looking sharp and dangerous against the Tigers before picking up his injury around the 25 minute mark.</p>
      <p>He suffered the damage while going on a typical side-stepping break, leaving two or three defenders clutching thin air with a series of steps.</p>
      <p>His searing break earned a ruck penalty when he was eventually brought to ground, but worryingly he stayed down, signalling there was a problem.</p>
      <p>He underwent treatment, having his knee strapped up, and soldiered on for a few minutes.</p>
      <p>But he had to admit defeat in the end, coming off just after Leicester claimed the opening try of the match on 32 minutes.</p>
      <p>Now we await news on the injury.</p>
