      <p><b>Update: </b>The Irish Prison Service has said it is investigating the death of a prisoner at Cloverhill in Dublin.</p>
      <p>In a statement, it says all practicable measures are taken by prison management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody.</p>
      <p>However, it says regrettably no prison system can be completely free of violence and inter prisoner assaults do occur.</p>
      <p>The man in his 30s died last night after an incident involving two inmates at around midnight.</p>
      <p>It adds that gardaí and the office of the Inspector of Prisons are also investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>
