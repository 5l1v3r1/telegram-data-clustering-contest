      <h1>Mobiles seized from Kashmir's VIP prisoners' rooms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:09:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/zulfikar-majid-1" target="_blank">Zulfikar Majid </a></address>
      <p>Jammu and Kashmir police seized at least a dozen phones during a search operation of rooms of political detainees at MLA Hostel, here, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sources told <i>Deccan Herald</i> that security personnel searched the rooms of nearly three dozen VIP politicians, who are undergoing detention since August 5 after the Center abrogated Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two union territories.</p>
      <p>"The searches were carried after it came to the notice of the security wing of the J&amp;K police that the VIP prisoners were using mobile phones from the MLA Hostel, which had been converted into a sub-jail last week," they said and added during the searches a dozen mobile phones were seized.</p>
      <p>Most of these 33 detainees are former legislators and ministers and belong to regional National Conference, PDP and Peoples Conference. A senior official told <i>DH </i>that these leaders were in contact with their workers and were giving instructions to them from the jail itself.</p>
      <p>"We got the input and promptly took the action. Investigations are on as how mobile phones reached inside the sub-jail," he added.</p>
      <p>On Sunday when these politicians were shifted to the MLA Hostel from the Centaur Hotel, which had been converted into a sub jail since August 5, fractious scenes were witnessed as a couple of politicians engaged in a verbal spat with security personnel.</p>
      <p>Reports had emerged that commotion broke when an on-duty police official conducted a body search on the People’s Conference chief Sajad Lone, a former BJP ally, who objected to the policeman’s “behavior”. There were also unconfirmed reports of Lone and three other politicians being hackled by the security personnel.</p>
      <p>Iltija Mufti, daughter of PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, in a tweet said, “Manhandling started when Sajjad Lone was repeatedly frisked and asked to undress. New jail windows are blocked with woods, lack heaters and have surveillance jammers." </p>
      <p>However, J&amp;K Director General Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh had refuted the allegations of manhandling of these leaders. "It is absolutely incorrect as no such incident happened," he had said.</p>
