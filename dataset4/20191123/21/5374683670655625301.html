      <h1>Gantz: 'Likud leaders, this is the time to speak up'</h1>
      <h2>Blue and White leader blames PM Netanyahu for political deadlock, incitement, offers to lead unity government.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:04:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Arutz Sheva Staff</a></address>
      <p>Blue and White leader MK Benny Gantz on Saturday night slammed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit's <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272061">decision to indict him.</a></p>
      <p>"Netanyahu is an Israeli patriot. But a true patriot would not hold Israeli citizens hostage for the sake of his own legal battle," Gantz said.</p>
      <p>"The one stepping on his political rivals, who did not have mercy on them even during the harshest hours, is the last person who can rally the public to incite against police officers, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
      <p>"These past few days do not leave room for doubt: Netanyahu is risking inciting a civil war."</p>
      <p>According to Gantz, he himself is the answer to the political deadlock and Netanyahu's pending indictment.</p>
      <p>"I call for the formation of a broad unity government headed by myself," he said. "I will be prime minister for the first two years, and if Netanyahu is acquitted, he will come back. We can avoid elections. Likud leaders, this is the time to speak up."</p>
      <p>The Likud party responded: "After he <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271992">failed to form a government</a>, Benny Gantz is offering to form a government led by himself. If Blue and White appoint a new chairman instead of Benny Gantz, we will contemplate offering them to lead the rotation."</p>
