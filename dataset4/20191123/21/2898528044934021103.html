      <h1>Second suspect arrested, charged in connection with Walt Harris’ missing stepdaughter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>A second suspect has been arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping in relation to the disappearance of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard, who is the stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1436/walter-walt-harris">Walt Harris</a>.</p>
      <p>Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes confirmed to <a href="https://www.wrbl.com/news/breaking-second-suspect-arrested-in-aniah-blanchards-alleged-kidnapping/">WRBL</a> in Alabama that 35-year-old suspect Antwain “Squirmy” Fisher was arrested Friday night in Montgomery, Ala. and then booked into the Lee County Detention Facility on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Fisher is being held without bond.</p>
      <p>No additional information on Fisher’s arrest was available due to a gag order that has been issued regarding the case as the investigation into Blanchard’s disappearance continues.</p>
      <p>Fisher is the second suspect arrested in the case after Ibraheem Yazeed, 30, was initially charged with first-degree kidnapping. Yazeed was apprehended by authorities in Florida and extradited back to Alabama where he made an initial court appearance earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The judge in the case denied Yazeed bond after he was already out on bond in a separate case where he was charged with kidnapping, robbery and attempted murder.</p>
      <p>Blanchard first went missing on the evening of Oct. 23 after she spoke to a friend before visiting a local convenience store in the Auburn, Ala. area. Yazeed was seen on surveillance footage in the store at the same time as Blanchard and a witness later came forward and identified him as the man he saw forcing the 19-year-old student into her car against her will.</p>
      <p>Blanchard’s 2017 Honda CR-V was recovered two days later at an apartment complex in Montgomery, Ala. and forensic evidence showed that a “life threatening” amount of blood was discovered inside. Evidence was also recovered that showed a male was also in the vehicle after investigators declared that Blanchard was likely harmed and a victim of foul play.</p>
      <p>At the time of Yazeed’s initial arrest, authorities stated that they expected additional suspects to be involved in Blanchard’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>A reward totaling $105,000 including donations made by UFC president <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>, UFC light heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/47/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> and prominent MMA manager Ali Abdelaziz have been offered for any information that would help find Blanchard.</p>
      <p>Harris, a veteran UFC heavyweight, was originally scheduled to return to action on Dec. 7 but he dropped out of his bout to focus on the search for his missing stepdaughter.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the case is urged to contact the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391 or the 24 hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100.</p>
