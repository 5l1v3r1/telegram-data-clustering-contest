        <b>Pep Guardiola is determined to ignore the gap between Liverpool and Manchester City in the title race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>City kept the pressure on Jurgen Klopp’s leaders by coming from behind to beat Frank Lampard’s Chelsea 2-1 at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>Liverpool had earlier today seen off Crystal Palace late on by the same scoreline in controversial circumstances.</p>
      <p>An arguably lucky break with VAR led to the Reds picking up their 12th win in 13 top-flight matches.</p>
      <p>But City responded through Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez to end Chelsea’s strong run under Lampard.</p>
      <p>N’Golo Kante had given the Blues a deserved lead in the first half before City battled back, and Guardiola was asked whether he was worried at 1-0.</p>
      <p>Guardiola, though, emphatically told Sky Sports: “We came back.</p>
      <p>“You can approach thinking we're going 12 points off, or nine points if it's a good game, always the press conferences before the game it's about 'things are going bad' or 'we are going to lose the Premier League'. Ok, we are going to lose the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"I know what happens in the Premier League after a team wins, what happens the next year. I know what has happened in the last 10 years. And we won it again. And today, there is a team who is almost unstoppable.</p>
      <p>“There has been just one draw. Without that you have a good chance. In any game, do we give up? We fought, we fought, and we fought today. The others are better, and they play better, so of course we can lose.</p>
      <p>"But it's always like this - what happens if it goes bad. There will be sunshine tomorrow, well not in Manchester...</p>
      <p>“You can always think the players will show you, you can encourage them that they will make it 1-1 and we could have scored more goals.</p>
      <p>"When we play like today or like Liverpool, playing teams with quality, you are going to suffer.”</p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero and Rodri added to Guardiola’s injury woes during the Chelsea game as they were forced off.</p>
      <p>And Argentina striker Aguero looks set for a spell out on the sidelines in what could be as damaging a loss for City as Aymeric Laporte.</p>
      <p>Guardiola added: “We have a lot of problems, players not in the top condition and injuries, and it's not easy to maintain that level.</p>
      <p>“You see (Chelsea’s) midfield, they have incredible physicality. But that's it. They beat Ajax and they did incredible, but we know what they're like so that's why I give our team a lot of credit."</p>
      <p>On Aguero, who voluntarily hobbled off with a muscle problem, Guardiola revealed: "I think Sergio will be bad. [He may miss] the toughest period of the season."</p>
      <p>Up next for City in the Premier League is a trip to Newcastle next Saturday lunchtime before Liverpool host Brighton the same afternoon.</p>
