      <p>AC Milan boss Stefano Pioli said he felt "confident for the future" after his side battled to a 1-1 draw with Napoli at San Siro.</p>
      <p>Giacomo Bonaventura scored his first goal in more than a year to cancel out Hirving Lozano's opener and earn Milan a point in Saturday's Serie A clash.</p>
      <p>The Rossoneri have won just one of six matches since Pioli replaced Marco Giampaolo last month, but the ex-Fiorentina boss was pleased with his team's latest display.</p>
      <p>"We played a good game, despite the absentees and other difficulties," he said at his post-match news conference.</p>
      <p>"I am seeing great determination and awareness and I'm confident for the future, but there is still a long way to go.</p>

      <p>"I have only been working here for 45 days. You cannot say that the team does not fight.</p>
      <p>"We all feel the sense of urgency to win games and we have the possibility to do that in our next matches, though it will not be easy."</p>
      <p>Milan have collected just 14 points from their opening 13 matches and are down in 13th, 10 points adrift of the Champions League qualification spots.</p>
      <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to be linked with a return to the club he represented between 2010 and 2012, but Pioli reiterated that he is not looking ahead to the transfer window.</p>
      <p>"In January we will see," he said. "Tomorrow we go back to work because from here until then there are 12 more points available."</p>

      <p>A major positive for Pioli was the performance of Bonaventura, who marked his second Serie A start of the season with a first goal since October 2018, driving home a fine 20-yard strike.</p>
      <p>"He is not only strong but also very intelligent," Pioli said. "He knows where to move and when to do it. 'Jack' played for 90 minutes and did very well."</p>
      <p>Next up for Milan are back-to-back away trips to Parma and Bologna, with left-back Theo Hernandez hoping to build some momentum from those matches.</p>
      <p>"This was a very important point for us," Hernandez told Sky Sport Italia. "We knew it would be complicated against a good opponent, but now we have to win games.</p>
      <p>"Milan cannot stay where we are in the table. We have to concentrate on the matches ahead and take it one step at a time to improve game by game."</p>
