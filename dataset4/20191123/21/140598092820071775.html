      <h1>BBC Radio 4 will broadcast 10-minute 'soundscape' of Archers characters baking mince pies at Christmas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>BBC Radio 4 will broadcast a 10-minute "soundscape" of Archers characters baking mince pies to give listeners a taste of Christmas in Ambridge.</p>
      <p>Patricia Greene, who plays gifted cook and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/17/archers-matriarchs-use-money-control-children-says-oxford-academic/">village matriarch Jill Archer</a>, will be rustling up a batch of the sweet treats in her fictional kitchen at Brookfield Farm in December.</p>
      <p>Listeners will hear her kneading the dough, rolling it out and cutting it into rounds before filling it with homemade mincemeat and sliding it into the AGA.</p>
      <p>Not forgetting the traditional topping, she also be heard whipping up some brandy butter.</p>
      <p>The clink of cups will chime through the kitchen as she boils up a well-deserved cup of tea to sip during the baking session.</p>
      <p>However, those hoping to scribble down the recipe for her delicious mince pies will be disappointed, as that is never revealed.</p>
      <p>The first episode of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/the-archers/">The Archers</a> was broadcast on January 1, 1951 and it is the world's longest running drama.</p>
      <p>It follows the trials and tribulations of the Archer family and their neighbours in the fictional county of Borsetshire.</p>
      <p>Greene joined the cast as Jill Patterson in 1957. Her character goes on to marry farmer Phil Archer and they have four children together, becoming the First Family of Ambridge.</p>
      <p>She is one of the radio soap's best-loved and most enduring characters, and appeared on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2015 in honour of her longevity.</p>
      <p>Greene has admitted she had no experience in radio broadcasting when she auditioned for the role and that her school drama teacher told her she had no future in acting.</p>
      <p>But she channeled the sultry tones of actress Fenella Fielding in her audition - a performance which won her the job.</p>
      <p>"I was totally useless," she told broadcaster Kirsty Young. "They said you're coming in as a love interest for Philip, six weeks only, a sexy blonde in a tea tent. That's what the director said."  </p>
      <p>But the show's creator, Godfrey Baseley, recognised her talent.</p>
      <p>"After my first six weeks which were horrible and I couldn't do anything, he came in and said: Congratulations. Cut the sex, you're going to marry him."</p>
      <p>Sound effects used during filming of The Archers over the years include a log striking a cabbage to emulate a cow kicking someone, and Alka Seltzer dissolving in a glass of water to replicate the bubbles in a glass of champagne.</p>
      <p>Hailed as capturing the "quieter side of life in the village" during a peaceful Saturday, this festive episode will be broadcast on December 7.</p>
      <p>On Christmas day, listeners will be treated to a short story on BBC Radio 4 starring double Oscar winner Glenda Jackson, 83,<b> </b>and Game of Thrones heartthrob Kit Harington, 32.</p>
      <p>Adapted for the airwaves, Neil Gaiman's 'Chivalry' sees Mrs Whitaker, voiced by former MP Jackson,<b> </b>discover the Holy Grail in a charity shop.</p>
      <p>She ends up at the centre of<b> </b>Sir Galahad's (Harington) "most important quest" - and ropes him into doing some chores along the way.</p>
