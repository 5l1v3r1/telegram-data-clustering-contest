      <h1>Roy Hodgson: 'Wilfried Zaha back to best form'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-hodgson/"><b>Roy Hodgson</b></a> has claimed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/wilfried-zaha/"><b>WIlfried Zaha</b></a> is now back to his best form after scoring his first goal of the season against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> this afternoon.</h2>

      <p>The Ivory Coast international levelled things up eight minutes from time at Selhurst Park, although his equaliser was ultimately in vain as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-firmino/"><b>Roberto Firmino</b></a> netted a winner three minutes later to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">seal another victory</a> for the league leaders.</p>
      <p>Hodgson admitted that there was "big responsibility" on Zaha's shoulders as Palace's star man, but the former England boss was full of praise for the winger's display.</p>
      <p>"I think drawing criticism as a professional footballer is part and parcel of the job. It's something which you have to learn to live with," Hodgson told reporters at his post-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"I think the most important criticism which Wilf needs to take to heart are any criticisms that will come from myself or my coaching staff vis a vis the job we are asking him to do. Today he was very good. Today he was certainly back to, in my opinion, his best form. I've not really seen him playing games against top-level oppositions better than he did today, and that gives me great heart and hope for the future because we believe in him.</p>
      <p>"He's not just loved by the fans, he's loved by the players and the coaching staff as well because we know what he can do. But he also needs to understand - which he does - that it's a big responsibility and we're all looking for him to give these sort of performances and to score the goal that he did score. I know that he is very disappointed that he didn't make it two, because that was a really good chance he got at the end through [Andros] Townsend's wonderful through-ball."</p>
      <p>Zaha's goal ended a run of 13 Premier League games without finding the back of the net, stretching back to May.</p>
