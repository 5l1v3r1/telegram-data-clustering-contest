      <p>POWELL RIVER  5<br/>VICTORIA  3</p>
      <p>Former Vancouver Canucks forward Chris Higgins admitted he might not be impartial, as an Ivy Leaguer who played at Yale, but gave a big shout out to U.S. collegiate NCAA hockey.</p>
      <p>The chief portal for Canadians to get into the NCAA are Junior A circuits such as the B.C. Hockey League, in which the host Powell River Kings defeated the Victoria Grizzlies 5-3 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The BCHL, on average, sends between 90 to 110 graduates to the NCAA each year. There were 272 BCHL alumni on the 60 NCAA Division 1 teams last season, with only six NCAA Division 1 teams not having a former BCHL player on the roster.</p>
      <p>“I may be biased, but I feel the NCAA is a more intense game because you only play on weekends and there is not a lot of time spent on buses,” said Higgins, now involved in player development with the Canucks.</p>
      <p>“The games are fewer, but physical and fast because of it. It’s better suited for development.”</p>
      <p>The 2019 NHL draft was split almost evenly at about 33 per cent of players each from the NCAA and U.S. development system, Canadian major-junior and Europe.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just the number of players [from the American system] that are going in the first round, it’s the number that are consistently at the elite high end of the first round, including in the top five,” said Higgins, from Smithtown, New York, who twice played for the U.S. in the World Junior Championships.</p>
      <p>Higgins was at the leading edge of that wave as the 14th overall selection in the first round of the 2002 draft. He went to the Montreal Canadiens and played 11 seasons in the NHL, the last six with the Canucks.</p>
      <p>Higgins was in Victoria late in the week as part of the Canucks alumni delegation that received a proclamation from Premier John Horgan, signed by the Queen, commemorating the club’s 50th anniversary season in the NHL.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, scouts from both NCAA and pro were spread out across the BCHL this weekend as usual.</p>
      <p>In Powell River on Saturday, the Kings got goals from Reilly Moran, Ethan Schmunk, Brett Roloson, Hunter McCoy and Brett Pfoh to move to 13-14. The reeling Grizzlies fell to 8-21 and have now lost nine of their last 10 games.</p>
      <p>Victoria got goals from Cody Monds, Isack Bandu and defenceman Nico Somverville. NCAA Cornell Big Red-bound Joe Howe made 32 saves in goal for the Grizzlies. Thomas Wardle stopped 26 shots for Powell River.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies play Cowichan Valley on Tuesday and Friday at The Q Centre.</p>
