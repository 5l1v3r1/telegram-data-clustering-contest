Known for his isolations and smooth movements, Matt doesn't disappoint as he and a group of talented dancers break it down to a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Billie-Eilish-Bad-Guy-Dance-Video-2019-46045945">remix of Billie's new tune</a>. The music's rapid rhythm might make you wonder if the performers can keep up, but <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Jenna-Dewan-Dance-Video-Billie-Eilish-Bury-Friend-46024927">no one misses a single beat</a>. These are trained professionals, people! Watch the dance video above, and see if you can bust a move to the quick, robotic melody.</p>
