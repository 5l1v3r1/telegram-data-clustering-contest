      <p>Fine Gael has seen its support fall following the controversy over its Wexford by-election candidate Verona Murphy.</p>
      <p>The latest Business Post/Red C poll shows Leo Varadkar's party still leads the way on 30%, but has dropped two points.</p>
      <p>During her Wexford by-election campaign, Ms Murphy has had to apologise twice for comments she made about asylum seekers, and that seems to be reflected in this latest Red C sample of a thousand adults between November 14 and 21.</p>
      <p>It shows support for Fine Gael is down by two points to 30%, although it still retains a strong lead over Fianna Fáil which is unchanged on 24%.</p>
      <p>It comes at a time when all parties and Independents are gearing up for the four by-elections being held on Friday and the forthcoming general election next year.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin has made no gains from publicity around its recent Ard Fheis in Derry and is unchanged on 11%.</p>
      <p>Labour, which recently had its national conference in Mullingar in Westmeath, is up by two points to 6%.</p>
      <p>Support for current Independent TDs has dropped by one point to 12%, while the Greens are unchanged on 7%.</p>
      <p>The Independent Alliance, unchanged on 4%, the Social Democrats and Solidarity-People Before Profit are on 2% and Aontú is on 1%.</p>
