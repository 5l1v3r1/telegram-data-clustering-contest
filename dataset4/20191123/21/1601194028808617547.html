      <p>It's easy to deduce right now that apart from Brock Lesnar, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> is the most protected Superstar in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a>.</p>
      <p>Equipped with an incredibly well-crafted gimmick and the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/universal-championship">Universal Championship</a> title, Wyatt is on the receiving end of a monster push as the top champion on SmackDown.</p>
      <p>But how long does WWE want him to hold onto the belt?</p>
      <p>Sportskeeda's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/profile/tom-colohue">Tom Colohue</a> revealed that he has heard rumors that the company possibly intends to keep the Universal title on Wyatt beyond WrestleMania.</p>
      <p>It was, however, noted that the aforementioned bit of backstage speculation is not that strong at the moment as there is still quite a long way to go until next year's Showcase of the Immortals.</p>
      <blockquote>"I'm starting to hear rumours that #WWE could keep The Fiend Bray Wyatt as the Universal champion after Wrestlemania."</blockquote>

      <p>It's a known fact that plans change regularly in the WWE and the Creative team could very well go back to the drawing board based on what happens in the months to come. It's quite possible that the idea of having a very long reign for Wyatt that extends beyond next year's 'Mania may have been pitched behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>One thing that is beyond doubt at this point is that WWE wants to legitimize Wyatt's stint as the Universal Champion. His feud with Daniel Bryan is expected to improve the in-ring aspect of the title reign while also making him look like a dominant champion in the process.</p>
      <p>The Fiend will take on the Leader of the Yes Movement at the upcoming Survivor Series PPV and a surprising title change seems highly unlikely to happen.</p>
      <p>WWE is known to chalk out the plans for WrestleMania well in advance and they may already have set something up for The Fiend.</p>
      <p>He should ideally go into WrestleMania 36 in Tampa, Florida on April 6th as the Universal Champion. If he does manage to draw the ratings as a credible champion until the biggest show of the year, we can certainly see the company continue his reign even after WrestleMania is done and dusted.</p>
