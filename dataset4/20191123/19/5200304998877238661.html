      <p>With online streaming services becoming a popular choice for filmmakers to explore to release their movies, news has it that Vidhu Vinod Chopra will be the next name to jump on the digital bandwagon with his forthcoming ‘Shikara: A Love letter From Kashmir’.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Asian Age</i>, Chopra will release his project on an OTT streaming platform instead of having it released in the theatres. This could be down to his previous slew of films not working so well at the box office.</p>
      <p>The film was initially due to release in early November. However, it has now been postponed until February 2020.</p>
