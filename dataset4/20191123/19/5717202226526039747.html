      <p>It is understood that manager Dean Smith admirers the Argentinian attacker, but it’s likely he would cost over £20million.</p>

      <p>A selection of Villa supporters on social media have claimed that Buendia would be a top addition to their side, but feel it would be an extremely tough deal to pull off.</p>
      <p>He was one of the standout players in the Championship last season and looks like he can have success in the top-flight as he develops.</p>
      <p>Smith was given a significant budget in the summer to strengthen the squad, but reports suggest he would have to spend big again to land Norwich’s maestro.</p>
