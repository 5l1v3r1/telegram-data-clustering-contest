      <p>A severely colorblind Minnesota boy landed somewhere over the rainbow thanks to a pair of special eyeglasses.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Jones, 12, burst into tears when he got a chance to borrow the unique eyewear, which allows the user to see color.</p>
      <p>The seventh-grader and his peers at Lakeview High School were learning about colorblindness when Jones’ principal, Scott Hanson, who is also severely colorblind, allowed Jonathan to borrow his special glasses. The boy’s brother recorded video of the exchange.</p>
      <p>“They’re all yours, let’s see what it does,” Hanson told the boy, handing him the glasses.</p>
      <p>Jones swaps his traditional eyeglasses for the new pair, which look like sunglasses with an iridescent sheen, the video shows.</p>
      <p>He gives a look of surprise, as the class erupts in laughter and applause. Seconds later, the overwhelmed boy bursts into tears.</p>
      <p>Hanson comforts him with a hug.</p>
      <p>“I’m so happy for you  … that is so awesome. I told you it’s going to be a little emotional,” Hanson said.</p>
      <p>Jones’ mother, Carole Walter Jones, was also present for the special moment and embraced her son, before he walks around the classroom, observing the various colorful decorations.</p>
      <p>“Hey Jon if you can laugh and cry in the same day … that is the greatest day ever,” Hanson said. “Why don’t you keep those for a little while. You can take them home with you today and just wear them around, and I want you to experience as much as you can and maybe your parents will buy you a pair.”</p>
      <p>The heartwarming video went viral after Jones’ brother, Ben Jones, posted it to Twitter, along with a link to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sp7m4-color-blind-glasses?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet">a GoFundMe page</a> asking for $350 to buy the boy his own pair of the glasses.</p>
      <p>The post received a huge response.</p>
      <p>“Growing up Red/Green blind and blue/yellow deficient…. lemme tell you, seeing something like this gives me hope that there are really great people out there!!” <a href="https://twitter.com/HavokS085/status/1197931892424753153">@HavokS085 tweeted.</a></p>
      <p>More than 87,000 people liked the Tweet, and the GoFundMe had raised $13,265 from 617 donors as of early Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Jones’ pledged to donate the rest of the funds to “a foundation who purchases colorblind glasses for those who can’t afford them.”</p>
