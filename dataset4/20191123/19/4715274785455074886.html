      <p>Digital lifestyle innovator Power Mac Center introduced to the Philippines House of Marley’s Liberate Air True Wireless Earphones, an eco-friendly pair carefully crafted from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled silicone and fabric.</p>
      <p>Liberate Air is welcomed into PMC’s comprehensive list of audio tech offerings through “Sounds Good! Coastal Cleanup,” a 100-percent sustainable event done in partnership with HOM and non-profit organization Communities Organized for Resource Allocation Philippines at the Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area.</p>

      <p>This is in line with a report by UN Environment Programme that the global tech industry produces 50 million tons of electronic and electrical waste with only 20 percent of it formally recycled. Famed for its sustainability efforts, HOM changes the norm in an industry that usually faces a challenge in sourcing materials that are both good for the planet and able to get the job done. </p>
      <p>The audio brand proposes better-for-the-planet alternatives that prove that quality audio don’t have to come at the expense of the environment. HOM and PMC urge everyone to finally make the switch and be conscious of the ecological impact of the products they consume.</p>
      <p>“We at Power Mac Center are conscious of our ecological footprint, and therefore are taking bigger leaps towards environmental sustainability,” said PMC director of product management, marketing and space planning Joey Alvarez.</p>
