      <p>Bulldozers cleared loads of garbage out of a homeless camp in Surrey Saturday morning, following a previous warning from the city to the campers that they would be coming in. </p>
      <p>Workers were accompanied by RCMP as they moved debris from the so-called "Sanctuary Tent City" next to King George Boulevard located on private property. </p>
      <p>Some campers still remained, despite the offer of a warm bed at a new shelter called "The Cove," <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/bulldozers-roll-into-surrey-homeless-camp-but-some-people-remain-1.4699711">CTV News</a> reports. </p>
      <p>A woman named Robin was one of those who stayed, worried about how her beloved dog Shelby would get along with others in a confined shelter. </p>
      <p>Another couple, Dan and Kim, who are older, have lived at the camp for five years. </p>
      <p>"Finally broke down,” Kim said. “We have to move out of here, we realize that.”</p>
      <p>Dave Diewert of Alliance Against Displacement likened the experience to an assault. </p>
      <p>"Watching them destroy people’s places and slash through this with massive equipment.”</p>
      <p>Crews will continue to clean up the area over the next few days, but for now are letting remaining campers take a bit more time to pack up and head out. </p>
