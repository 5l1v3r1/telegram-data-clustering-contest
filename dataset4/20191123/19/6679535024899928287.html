      <p>The city police recently signed an agreement with HCL to adopt 30 boys’ and girls’ clubs in the city and improve their facilities.</p>
      <p>Boys’ and girls’ clubs were started by the police in 2003 to train and help children from lower-income groups.</p>
      <p>Skipping his routine activities, Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, accompanied by other police officers, spent time with children from the clubs on Saturday. They had gathered for a prize distribution ceremony. After distributing prizes, he first served them food and then joined them for lunch.</p>
      <p>Earlier, he said the clubs would be activated at all police stations, as part of the community-policing initiative, to help students of lower-income groups scale greater heights in their chosen fields.</p>
      <p>Mr. Viswanathan said: “Our goal is to create a platform for these children to hone their skills in education, sports and extra-curricular activities.”</p>
      <p>Additional Commissioner of Police, North, R. Dhinakaran said HCL had signed an agrement for improving the 30 clubs.</p>
