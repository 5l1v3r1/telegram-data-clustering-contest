He also thanked Ajit Pawar and other alliance partners for their important role. Fadnavis also echoed the famous ‘Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai’ chant.

      <blockquote>Fadnavis said, "Today, we have formed the government in Maharashtra once again under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I want to thank Ajit Pawar and the NCP MLAs along with the Independent MLAs who have helped us form a strong government. Whether it is Ramdas Athawale, Sadabhai Khot, Vinayak Mete, and other alliance partners. It is true that one friend is not with us. But as our attachment is with the people of Maharashtra, we took a decision to form a stable government with NCP’s Ajit Pawar. I want to assure you that Modiji Hai Toh Mumkin Hai. Whatever Modi says will happen. I thank Modiji, Amit Shahji, Naddaji, and Chandrakant Dada Patil ji. I want to thank all my colleagues. I want to assure that you that the government will work towards securing the Maharashtra of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s dream, the Maharashtra of Babasaheb Ambedkar for the welfare of the farmers." </blockquote>

      <h3>Cracks in the NCP</h3>
      <p>While the BJP claims that the entire NCP legislative party has consented to be a part of the government, the NCP supremo made it clear that he did not endorse the decision of Ajit Pawar. As per the sources, the government has to prove its majority in the Maharashtra assembly by November 30. Sources also revealed that more than 40 MLAs attended the NCP meeting called by Sharad Pawar, while 7 MLAs in the Ajit Pawar camp are believed to have changed their stance.   </p>
