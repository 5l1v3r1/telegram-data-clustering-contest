      <h1>Rudy Giuliani: Joe Biden’s jab at Lindsey Graham reminds me of a ‘mafia case’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:01:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Kay Linge</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden lashed out at Senate Republicans for their plans to investigate his son Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine — and Rudy Giuliani responded by comparing the former veep to a mafia don.</p>
      <p>Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/joe-biden-don-lemon-cnntv/index.html">said he is “embarrassed”</a> for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in a Friday interview with CNN.</p>
      <p>“Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he’s going to regret his whole life,” Biden said, in response to news that Graham <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/lindsey-graham-requests-biden-ukraine-docs-from-state-department/">asked the State Department for documents</a> related to the Bidens’ communications with former Ukrainian and U.S. officials over Burisma, a company that hired Hunter Biden for a cushy job while his father was vice president.</p>
      <p>“They have him under their thumb right now,” Biden continued. “They know he knows, if he comes out against Trump, he’s got a real tough road for re-election.”</p>
      <p>Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1197992624180867072">leaped to Graham’s defense</a>.</p>
      <p>“Now a threat to a US Senator,” he tweeted. “This is getting to be more and more like my old mafia cases. They sure do sound like crooks.”</p>
