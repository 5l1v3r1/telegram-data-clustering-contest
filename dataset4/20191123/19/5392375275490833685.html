      <p>Huawei nova 5T Pro specifications disclosed by Android Enterprise listing<br/>4 (80%) 13 votes</p>
      <p>Huawei has released the Huawei nova 5T Pro back in August, but apparently, this lineup is ready to receive a Pro variant. This new device carrier the Huawei nova 5T Pro moniker and has appeared on <a href="https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device/#!/ycP7uC9hdtC2tBp9a7qA">Google’s Android Enterprise listing</a>. Interestingly enough, the listing also showcases an image of the alleged smartphone which will look similar to its vanilla sibling.</p>

      <p>Besides the picture and the name, the listing also reveals some of the specifications. It boasts a 5.5-inch screen that comes along with 8GB of RAM. We believe that it will run with some of Huawei’s own Kirin chipsets. The listing also reveals that Android 9 Pie will be running the show and that is a bit underwhelming. After all, Huawei already has Android 10-based EMUI 10, and releasing a new smartphone with an older Android version isn’t the wisest of the choices. The Huawei nova 5T Pro features NFC and has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. It will be available in two storage options with 128GB and 256GB respectively. Judging by the handset’s picture, it also features a punch-hole in the display for the selfie snapper.</p>
      <p>The original nova 5T is a rebranded Honor 20 and back in June, the Honor 20 Pro was listed as nova 5T Pro. If that is the case, then we can expect a Kirin 980 SoC along with a 48MP quad camera and a 4,000 mAh battery with 22.5W fast charging support. However, the original Honor 20 Pro has a 6.26-inch display, which is bigger than the device listed here. We have to wait for more details to confirm if that will be the case. If the Nova 5T Pro is just a rebranding, then it explains why it ships with Android 9 Pie.</p>
