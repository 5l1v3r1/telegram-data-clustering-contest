      <p>OPELOUSAS, La. — Opelousas (op-uh-LOO-suhs) will celebrate its tricentennial in 2020 and the community is being asked to participate.</p>
      <p>KATC-TV reports that residents will be able to contribute to creation of a new mural designed to celebrate the city’s 300 year anniversary. The collaborative mural is part of the Celebrate Opelousas 300 activities. Once it’s complete, a digital print will be used for the official poster.</p>
      <p>A $2,695 grant from the Acadiana Center for the Arts to Opelousas Tourism will help fund the project.</p>
      <p>The project will serve as a preservation tool in sharing information about the city’s history.</p>
      <p>Lead artist Jerome Ford has created a design that he calls “Tree of Life.” It features icons and symbols associated with Opelousas’ culture and heritage intertwined with an oak tree’s roots and branches.</p>
