      <h1>Samsung's HMD Odyssey+ headset is just $230 right now ($50 off), and it works with Half-Life Alyx</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:51:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Half-Life Alyx has re-ignited the interest in VR for many, but you don't strictly need Valve's $1K Index headset to play the game. <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1197578955944890369">Valve confirmed the title will work with all SteamVR-compatible systems</a>, which includes this Samsung HMD+ Odyssey headset, now just $229.99 from multiple stores. That's a savings of $50 from the usual price, and $271 below the original MSRP.</p>
      <p>This is a Windows Mixed Reality headset, so it works with all games that use the SteamVR, as well as titles from the Microsoft Store. It's the highest-end Mixed Reality headset available, with the same 2880x1600 resolution as the Valve Index.</p>
      <p>The integrated headphones are built by Samsung's AKG division, and there's also a built-in microphone. You won't have to shove your existing headset or headphones on top of the headset.</p>
