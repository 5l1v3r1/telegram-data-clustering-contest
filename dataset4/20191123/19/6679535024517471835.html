      <h2>Taken to her ancestral house and parents’ house for evidence collection</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:25:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/A-Correspondent-990/" target="_blank">A Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Koodathayi serial murder case brought prime accused Jolly Shaju to Kattappana for evidence collection on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She was taken to her ancestral home at Vazhavara and the house at Kattappana town where her father and mother are living at present.</p>
      <p>There was a huge crowd at her ancestral home when she was brought there around 10 a.m. A posse of police was stationed there.</p>
      <p>Nearly 17 years ago, a pet dog in the house was poisoned to death. It is suspected that her first victim — her mother-in-law Annamma — was killed using the same poison, which is now banned.</p>
      <h3>Parents’ statements</h3>
      <p>She was then brought to the current residence of her parents, a two-storey house at Valiyakandam near the town. The SIT team also took the statements of her parents.</p>
      <p>Jolly, who had co-operated with the SIT team in collecting evidence hiterto, seemed tense when she reached her ancestral house.</p>
