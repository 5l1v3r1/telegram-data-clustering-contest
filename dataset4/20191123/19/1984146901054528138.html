      <p>Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly was forced to be the hero of the hour when one of the show's couples got stuck together on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>During the BBC show's latest live broadcast, Alex Scott and pro partner Neil Jones performed the first Argentine Tango of the series after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> judge <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/bruno-tonioli-singing-strictly-video-17306885">Bruno Tonioli kicked things off by singing!</a></p>
      <p>Alex and Neil's routine was all going rather well right until the end when they became attached to each other because of a microphone malfunction.</p>
      <p>Neil had to carry Alex over to the judges table to get their critiques and, quickly realising what had happened, Tess came to their rescue by managing to untangle them, declaring "You're free!"</p>
      <p>Giving her comments head judge Shirley Ballas said "no dance brings you together quite like the Argentine Tango," to which Tess quipped "literally!"</p>
      <p>Unfortunately Alex and Neil got a mixed bag of scores from the judges with a total of just 26, including a poor 4 from notoriously hard to please Craig Revel-Horwood.</p>
