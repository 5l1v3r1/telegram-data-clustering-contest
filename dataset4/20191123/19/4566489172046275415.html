      <p>On November 8, the popular NBC soap opera celebrated its 54th anniversary. The show, which films eight months in advance, is wrapping its <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/days-of-our-lives-renewed-56th-season-nbc/">55th season</a> this month.</p>
      <p>The Internet erupted once fans heard that all of the actors on the show were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/arts/television/days-of-our-lives-canceled.html">released from their contracts</a>, which set off the false alarm that the daytime drama was in danger of getting canceled.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/breaking-news-days-renewed/">Soap Opera Digest</a></i>, Ken Corday, the executive producer of <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, noted that the show got a "one-year offer" from the NBC network, which will keep it on the air until September of 2021.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the show has released two digital series this year: the inaugural "Chad and Abby in Paris" and the upcoming "Last Blast Reunion," which premieres on November 29 on the DOOP app.</p>
      <p><i>Days of Our Lives</i> is one of the four remaining soap operas that is still on the air, along with <i>The Young and The Restless</i>, <i>The Bold and The Beautiful</i> and <i>General Hospital</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2018, <i>Days of Our Lives</i> won the Daytime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Drama Series," an honor that it has won a total of four times over the years.</p>
