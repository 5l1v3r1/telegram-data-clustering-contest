      <p>With <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/crystal-palace-vs-liverpool-premier-league-live-scores-latest/">Liverpool winning again</a>, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/jamie-vardy-hits-12th-goal-season-leicester-maintain-second/">Leicester recording a fifth successive Premier League victory </a>to retain their grip on second spot, there was simply no margin for error here for Manchester City against an upwardly mobile Chelsea side who started the day a point and a place above them in the table.</p>
      <p>The champions’ impressive reaction, then, to falling behind in a game they simply had to win should reaffirm that this is not a team who will surrender their title lightly.</p>
      <p>Whether City can claw back a nine point gap to the Premier League leaders is another matter, and with Sergio Aguero adding to their injury problems when he left the field 13 minutes from time with a muscular problem that will be assessed on Sunday, Pep Guardiola’s squad is being stretched like never before.</p>
      <p>Yet there was much to admire about the way they recovered from an early setback to lead and slowly take the sting out of the game, despite losing Rodri and then David Silva to cramp and fatigue in the second half and eventually Aguero, too. Guardiola said he expects the Argentina striker to be out “some days during the toughest part of our season”.</p>
      <p>Chelsea gave as good as they got in a display that further illustrated the strides this young side are taking under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Never before in Guardiola’s 381 top flight games as a manager with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and now City had one of his teams enjoyed less possession and it had the Catalan waxing lyrical about Lampard’s “courage to play”.</p>
      <p>But the statistic that mattered most was the three points City snaffled and the reality is they never really relinquished control once Kevin De Bruyne and a moment of inspiration from Riyad Mahrez had cancelled out N’Golo Kante’s opener. “There is always one thing in your lifetime that hasn’t happened,” a smiling Guardiola said in response to the 53-47 possession count in Chelsea’s favour. “So, OK, I have another record, I won one game without possession. They are incredible team with Kante, Kovacic, Jorginho, so it can happen.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Would Guardiola have cut quite such a relaxed figure had Mason Mount scored with a free-kick the Chelsea substitute sent a fraction wide in the 90th minute before Raheem Sterling had what seemed a perfectly legitimate goal chalked out for offside as he latched on to Mahrez’s knock on to score? Sterling’s backside was level with Kurt Zouma’s armpit if you must know and one can only have imagined City’s reaction had that decision proved more costly.</p>
      <p>This was, first and foremost, an absorbing game of football. Chelsea had conceded four goals inside 25 minutes en route to a 6-0 humiliation on their last visit to the Etihad but there were no inhibitions on this occasion and the biggest frustration for Lampard was that his team entered the interval behind after a superb start when they looked the more purposeful, dynamic side. They certainly had more than enough chances to add to Kante’s goal but City got some good fortune for their equaliser and were greatly improved thereafter, Mahrez’s brilliance nudging them in front before Kepa Arrizabalaga very nearly undid all of Chelsea’s good work. Shanking an intended pass straight to Aguero hovering around the D, the Chelsea goalkeeper was a relieved man when the City striker’s shot canonned back off the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Chelsea had been picked off in midfield at the Etihad in February, no one more so than Jorginho, who imploded under persistent harassment in one of the lowest moments of that difficult transition season. But the Italy midfielder was a different player here and, working harmoniously in tandem with Mateo Kovacic and Kante, they asked City plenty of questions. Indeed, it was the trio that combined for the first goal. Kovacic exchanged a quick one-two with Jorginho and then, spotting that Fernandinho had got sucked too high up the pitch in the Brazilian’s only blemish all afternoon, he floated a gorgeous pass over the City player’s head into the path of the onrushing Kante. Kante’s first touch was excellent and, holding off the attentions of Benjamin Mendy, he slotted a cool finish past the advancing Ederson.</p>
      <p>Chelsea had chances through Willian, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham to score more but City stepped up markedly once De Bruyne had levelled and, thereafter, it was hard not to admire how they asserted control and gradually pushed Chelsea deeper.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>City’s first originated from an underhit pass from Jorginho in a rare misstep that was intercepted by Fernandinho ahead of Abraham. De Bruyne picked up possession and switched the ball quickly to Silva. What followed was agonising for Lampard, Silva’s pass first deflecting off Zouma, then another Chelsea body, before De Bruyne cut on to his left and watched his shot take a wicked deflection off Zouma and past Arrizabalaga.</p>
      <p>The winner, though, was all about individual brilliance. When Rodri rolled the ball into the feet of Mahrez, there did not appear to be much on but the Algerian had only one thought in mind, wriggling past both Emerson and Kovacic in the tightest of spaces courtesy of a lovely shuffle of the feet and steering a lovely, low curling shot through the legs of Tomori into the bottom corner. </p>
      <p>With Bernardo Silva suspended and Aymeric Laporte, Leroy Sane and Oleksandr Zinchenko injured, the sight of first Rodri, then Silva and finally Aguero hobbling off was alarming for City fans but they absorb injuries like few can and, despite all that disruption, largely controlled the game in the second period. It was a most vital win. </p>

      <h3>FT: Manchester City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>A crucial win for City and overall another encouraging day for Lampard and Chelsea. They were not far from getting a result here. Very little wrong with their approach or performance.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1922">7:22PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>NO GOAL!</h3>
      <p>Sterling was judged to be offside by an armpit. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>GOAL! Raheem Sterling seals it</h3>
      <p>That will be that, then. It has been Sterling's quietest game for months, but he latches on to Jesus' flick on and finishes first time across Kepa. He got a hand to it, but the ball dribbled into the corner.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1920">7:20PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>92 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Chelsea counter-attack City's counter-attack. A ball bypasses the City midfield to find Kante in a pocket of space, and Gundogan brings him down. Free kick, dead central but surely 35 yards out or more. </p>
      <p>Mount over it, and City have a three-man wall. Great connection from Mount, but it curved just wide of the far post. Two minutes to play. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1918">7:18PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>90 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Chelsea have the ball back, but are not putting City under serious pressure. Willian almost finds Pulisic with a nice flick around the corner but it was just too strong. Ederson claims. Four minutes of stoppage time to play. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1915">7:15PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>88 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Great pass from Mahrez to send Foden clear in the left channel but he could not find Jesus or Sterling with the pull-back. Groans from the home crowd.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1914">7:14PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>87 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Positive play from Foden, trying to feed Jesus and the ball runs off a Chelsea defender for a corner. Kepa claims and Chelsea try to go again. Better pressing from City, but Chelsea play their way out of trouble through Kante and Mount. Mendy defends well before Mahrez wins a foul to buy a few more seconds. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1912">7:12PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>85 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>69 percent possession for Chelsea in the last 10 minutes. They force De Bruyne to go back to Ederson, who kicks the ball straight into Batshuayi's back. Fortunately for City the ball looped harmlessly wide of goal. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1910">7:10PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>82 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Chelsea attack through Mount but Batshuayi stumbled while trying to get on the end of his through ball. City have more or less stopped attacking now, but can Chelsea find a decisive moment?</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1908">7:08PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>80 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Huge tackle from Timori to stop De Bruyne running away from the Chelsea defence and setting up a tap-in. At the other end, a ball drops perfectly for Willian to volley and Ederson acrobatically tipped it over. Or did he? Goal kick given, wrongly according to the replays. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1905">7:05PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>78 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Chelsea seeing most of the ball now, but can they fashion a chance? City are doing a decent job of keeping them at bay. There has been much less space for Chelsea's attackers in this half. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1904">7:04PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>76 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>A flurry of changes has halted the momentum of this game and City make another: Gabriel Jesus on for Sergio Aguero. Fair to say Aguero is not rushing to get off. </p>
      <p>A De Bruyne freekick rebounds to Foden but the angle was against a left-footed and he shoots wide. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1901">7:01PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>73 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>City waiting for those one or two counter-attacking chances to arrive. Aguero goes down in the box under a challenge from James but Atkinson waves it away. Two Chelsea subs: Mason Mount on for Jorginho and Michy Batshuayi on for Tammy Abraham. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1859">6:59PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>72 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Nice link up play from Chelsea, but City can clear their lines after Abraham barges Fernandinho in the back as he was shepherding the ball out. </p>
      <p>The ball breaks for Foden to run at the Chelsea defence but his shot was tame and straight at Kepa. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1858">6:58PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>70 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>I think Lampard would have signed to be within a goal of City going into the final 20 minutes. Very good delivery from the right from James, but his cross just evaded Abraham. </p>
      <p>Chelsea keeping City penned in with a long spell of possession, a roar of approval from the away fans. The move ends when Mendy intercepts, getting there just before Reece James. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1856">6:56PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>68 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Wild effort from William from a narrow angle when he had bodies in the box to hit. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1854">6:54PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>67 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Phil Foden is on for David Silva who heads straight down the tunnel. Reece James has replaced Cesar Azpilicueta for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1852">6:52PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>64 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>The game has slowed in tempo since the restart. Both teams passing the ball patiently, but with little directness or penetration. City do not really need to over-commit, while Chelsea know there is plenty of time to find an equaliser. </p>
      <p>Good run from Sterling down the left and he wins a corner. Taken short, before Mahrez blasts over the bar after a magnificent block from Azpilicueta. Mahrez's shot was tipped over by Kepa in fact, and Chelsea clear the corner. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1849">6:49PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>61 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>De Bruyne skips away from Jorginho who brings him down at the expense of a yellow card. Chelsea starting to gain a bit more of a foothold in the game. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1846">6:46PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>58 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Danger growing for Chelsea, City's passing and movement is starting to click. Kovacic and Jorginho have been caught the wrong side on a couple of occasions now. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1843">6:43PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>56 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>City play through Chelsea's midfield too easily there. Kante sold himself and Silva picked the ball up in the pocket, spread play to De Bruyne on the right and his driven cross was tipped over for a corner by Kepa. The corner results in another corner...oooooh, well worked corner finds Cancelo in so much space but his side foot shot was cleared when it was heading for the far corner. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1841">6:41PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>53 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Better from Chelsea, Azpilicueta gets the bar-line in far too much space and picks out Kante with a pull-back, but Fernandinho denies him with a brilliant block. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1839">6:39PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>52 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>More control from City at the start of this half, and Ilkay Gundogan is ready to come on. Presume that is an injury problem because why not make the change at half-time. Yep, Rodri has his hand up and sock down, looks to have pulled a calf. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1837">6:37PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>50 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Chelsea try to go long and hit Abraham, but they fail to pick up the second ball and City have it back and can build again. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1836">6:36PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>48 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Brilliant stuff from Mahrez again, weaving his way across Chelsea's defence from the right. Gets all the way into a control position but does not get enough whip on his shot and it goes wide. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1835">6:35PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>47 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Plenty of City possession in the first few minutes of the half but no clear opportunities. Chelsea are struggling to get out of their half though, which will please Guardiola. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1833">6:33PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Back under way!</h3>
      <p>City kick off in the second half looking to build on their lead.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1827">6:27PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>That was a great half of football</h3>
      <p>You do not see many visiting teams at City take them on in a game of football, but Chelsea showed such personality on the ball in the first 25 minutes or so and yet they trail. City's general play has not been up to their usual standard but flashes of quality have been enough. </p>
      <p>

      <h3>HT: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>A flurry of Chelsea pressure at the end of the half there, but City lead. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1817">6:17PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>46 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>A rare bad decision from David Silva. Brilliant flick to send Sterling away down the left, his pull-back is just behind Aguero. He tees up Silva, who passes the ball straight out for a goal kick. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1815">6:15PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>45 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Chelsea starting to get a little ragged now, not keeping the ball with same authority. There will be two minutes of stoppage time. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1813">6:13PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>42 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Ooooohhh, almost suicidal from Chelsea. Kepa kicks the ball straight to Aguero in front of goal, Barthez and Henry style, but he gets underneath his shot a touch and it cannons off the bar. The rebound comes to David Silva, who looks Mahrez but Chelsea just about snuff it out. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1811">6:11PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>40 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Brilliant move from City, De Bruyne freed in the right channel and his cross flashes across the area. The Tomori slides in at Aguero's feet at the near post, a little rash but the ball had gone and there was not much contact. VAR says no penalty, upholding Martin Atkinson's original decision. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1809">6:09PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3> 38 minutes: Man City 2 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Attack is the best of defence for Chelsea , and they are back on the front foot. Willian away down the right but his low cross towards Abraham was not precise enough and Fernandinho got a block in. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1807">6:07PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>GOAL! City lead through Mahrez</h3>
      <p>That was a wonderful finish. City's wingers have not really been in the game, but this time Mahrez gets Emerson just where he wants him: backing away into the box. Ducks inside onto his trusty left foot and shoots between legs into the far corner. A piece of individual brilliance. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1806">6:06PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>36 minutes: Man City 1 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>Fine play by Kevin De Bruyne again, collecting the ball just outside the box and unleashing a left-foot shot that flies just over the bar. City not flowing today, but they still look dangerous in moments. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1803">6:03PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>33 minutes: Man City 1 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>City probing again, but Kepa is out quickly to smother Aguero's flick around the corner. Not seen very much of Sterling so far, Chelsea have kept him quiet. Same with Riyad Mahrez on the other flank. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1801">6:01PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>30 minutes: Man City 1 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>A bit cruel on Chelsea that, but now they need to focus on getting through to half-time. Going in behind would be a body blow given how well they have played. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1800">6:00PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>GOAL! City equalise through De Bruyne</h3>
      <p>A goal from nowhere, and there is no celebration from De Bruyne against his old team. Two doses of good fortune for City. First Silva's pass to Aguero deflected straight back to the Belgian at the edge of the area, then his shot clips Zouma's foot when it was heading straight for Kepa and comepletely wrong-foots him.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1757">5:57PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>26 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>City struggling here. A lack of intensity without the ball, or maybe Chelsea's quality in possession is making it look that away. This looks more like City from the late Pellegrini era. Quite open and easy to play against. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1756">5:56PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>24 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 1</h3>
      <p>City straight back onto the front foot, and Chelsea not helping themselves by coughing up possession in their own defensive third. They survive though, and some good pressing in midfield gets them going forward again. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1753">5:53PM</a>

      <h3>No complaints about him breaking forward now</h3>

      </p>
      <h3>GOAL! N'Golo Kante scores against City again</h3>
      <p>That goal was coming. Nice give and go between Kovacic and Jorginho in the middle of the park, and the Croatian lofts a ball over the top of City's defence for Kante to run onto. In the left channel, Kante was on the stretch and Mendy looked to have covered the goal, but he squeezed a shot through that ran into the far corner. What a start for Chelsea. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1749">5:49PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>19 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Abraham bundled over in the penalty area but the flag was up for offside. Kovacic and Jorginho offering so much control for Chelsea in possession, you do not see many teams show this composure at the Etihad. </p>
      <p>Emerson is wide open on the overlap but he elects to shoot near post and Ederson gathers easily. Poor choice. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1746">5:46PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>17 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Bernardo is serving his ban today, and he is being missed. He gets through so much off the ball work that helps City suffocate teams. Chelsea are able to get their heads up and pick passes so far. Jorginho has seen so much of the ball. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1745">5:45PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3> 15 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Really good game this. Liverpool might be miles clear, but it has the air of a proper game between two title challengers. Chelsea have a corner on the right that Willian whips in, and after Abraham tried to pluck it out of the air Timori swivelled on a shot that flew just wide. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1744">5:44PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>12 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>So far, so good for Lampard's team. City are struggling to find that killer space between midfield and defence where they cut you open. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1741">5:41PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>11 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Chelsea settling into a nice rhythm now. Pulisic is coming in from the left and receiving the ball behind City's midfield, this time they feed Kante but the pass was a touch behind him. Had to chop back and square to Abraham who curled wide when off balance.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1739">5:39PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>8 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Chelsea go close through Willian! Busy play from Abraham to win the ball down the left, and Mendy was out of position on the far side leaving Willian in acres. The striker finds him but, just like De Bruyne, his shot whistles just wide of the far post. Similar position to the goal he scored in this fixture three years ago. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1736">5:36PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>6 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Pulisic ventures into the City penalty area but cannot keep the ball under his spell. City break as Chelsea back off and back off Sergio Aguero but the move slows down with De Bruyne. Pulisic threatens to wriggle clear and start a counter of his own but the ball runs for a throw in to City. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1734">5:34PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>4 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Zouma shuffles across to meet the run of Sterling and put the ball out for a throw. Chelsea will need all of his recovery speed today. </p>
      <p>Oooooh, after a quiet start City click into gear. Fernandinho finds Aguero in a pocket of space between Emerson and Timori and he feeds the advancing De Bruyne with a neat through ball. He flashes a right-footed shot just wide of the far post. Those runs are so hard to track. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1732">5:32PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>2 minutes: Man City 0 Chelsea 0</h3>
      <p>Familiar midfield V from Chelsea, with Jorginho deep in the No 6 role, Kovacic to his left and Kante to his right. </p>
      <p>City knocking the ball around at the back in the first few minutes, Chelsea at first drop away into a mid-block but are encouraged to pressurise Cancelo. Zouma looks for a big switch to the right flank but City deal with it. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1729">5:29PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>KICK OFF!</h3>
      <p>Alan Smith informs us Kevin De Bruyne is starting his fifth league game in a row which is good news for City. He elevates their play to a higher plane. </p>
      <p>Chelsea get us going, kicking from right to left.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest/#update-20191123-1728">5:28PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Players on their way out</h3>
      <p>Not long now until the game of the Premier League weekend gets going. This game in the season Chelsea won the league under Antonio Conte was a cracker. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Looking forward to this</h3>
      <p>Should be a cracker. Brave team selection by Lampard to match up with City's 4-3-3. Tough afternoon in prospect for Azpilicueta up against Sterling. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>The game of the weekend</h3>
      <p>We are still a week short of getting our advent calendars out but already this is a must-win game for reigning Premier League champions Manchester City against a seriously slippery Chelsea attack. </p>
      <p>Nine points behind Liverpool, Pep Guardiola's team cannot afford any mistakes over the festive period if they are to stay in the race and today's game is surely set up for goals at both ends. </p>
      <p>City scored six without reply in this fixture last season but Chelsea will fancy their chances of troubling a back-line that could be built around a partnership of John Stones and Fernandinho. </p>
      <p>City do have Ederson back in goal however, and remain abundantly creative and penetrative going forward. </p>
      <p>Frank Lampard has guided Chelsea to six consecutive Premier League wins, although they maybe have something to prove against the league's stronger teams after losing at Manchester United, at home to Liverpool and also drawing with Leicester at Stamford Bridge when they were second best. </p>
      <p>A big decision for Lampard is who to play at right-back. Raheem Sterling gave Cesar Azpilicueta an absolute torrid in this game last season, and the younger legs of Reece James might be deemed more suitable for this tough assignment. Lampard has sometimes used a back five this season, and that might be an option this evening.</p>
      <p>"I still see them as the same strength," Lampard said of City. "I've watched them a lot this international break. They've had their injury problems but they are a great team and still as big a threat as they always have been." </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's verdict: "I think Chelsea, over many years, have been an incredible top team, but from the beginning (of this season) his team have played really good. He (Frank Lampard) is consistent with his ideas and the results are there. I'm happy for him."</p>
      <p>Team news on the way. </p>
