      <h1>Forgetful Joe Biden Can't Remember the Names of His Potential VP Picks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:57:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bronsonstocking" target="_blank">Bronson Stocking</a></address>
      <p>We all know Joe Biden is bad with names and remembering things in general. During a town hall in Iowa on Friday, Biden was asked who he would consider picking to be his vice-presidential running mate. Biden said he did not want to name any names because, as Biden put it, "the press will think that's who I picked." Of course, Biden's excuse for not naming names would be more believable if everybody didn't already know Biden's horrible track record when it comes to remembering things.</p>
      <p>In October, Biden was <a href="https://www.redstate.com/nick-arama/2019/10/27/joe-biden-goes-full-uncle-joe-gets-confused-about-whos-in-race/">asked</a> about his campaign's efforts to reach out to Hispanics. Biden responded by saying that he has "reached out extensively into the African, excuse me, Hispanic community..." but he did admit that "maybe the Cisneros' campaign is doing it," too. So Biden managed to forget what minority group he was even talking about and completely made up a fictional Hispanic candidate running for president by the name of "Cisneros."</p>
      <p>On the MSNBC debate stage this past week, Biden claimed to be endorsed by the only black woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate, at which point, a bewildered Kamala Harris, a black woman in the U.S. Senate, quickly corrected the confused man.</p>
      <p>Despite his concern that the media would think he was choosing them to be his vice president, Biden did his best to describe four women he would consider sharing his 2020 ticket with.</p>
      <p>"The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware," Biden began, referring to Sally Yates. Yates was <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2017/06/27/sally-yates-doubles-down-on-refusing-to-enforce-travel-order-n2347333">fired</a> by President Trump for refusing to enforce the travel ban after she read about the ban in a New York Times article.  </p>
      <p>"The leader of the, uh, the, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman...," a reference to Stacey Abrams. Props to Biden for getting her skin color right.</p>
      <p>“The, the two senators from the state of, uh, New Hampshire...,” a nod to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Sen. Maggie Hassan, whose skin colors Biden either could not remember or did not consider relevant.</p>
      <p>The former vice president seems to be going downhill pretty fast. To be sure, the 77-year-old has an awful lot on his plate. This past week, Biden became a grandfather again. Well, he became the grandfather back in Aug. 2018, but <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2019/11/20/lol-trump-congratulates-joe-biden-after-news-that-dna-confirms-hunter-biden-fath-n2556823">DNA</a> evidence just refuted his son Hunter's claim that the baby wasn't his. Also this past week, we learned that Ukraine was <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2019/11/20/ukraine-widens-probe-into-burisma-holdings-n2556831">widening </a>the probe into Burisma Holdings, which was unexplainably paying Hunter Biden $50,000 a month while his father handled foreign policy issues as vice president.</p>
      <p>Maybe it's a good thing he's losing his memory so he won't have to answer tough questions about Burisma.</p>
