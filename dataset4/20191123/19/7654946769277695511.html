      <p>Iran has a blunt message for its neighbors — stay out.</p>
      <p>The country’s vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri said Friday that regional nations should take care to not meddle in the country’s internal affairs, warning of unspecified consequences if they did, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>“Some countries in the region should know that they will not have an easy life in the region if clues are found that show they intervened to create unrest in Iran,” Jahangiri said.</p>
      <p>Iran has faced on again-off again protests in recent years and this week had to roll out their security forces to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-gasoline-protests/iran-says-army-and-guards-helped-quell-unrest-blames-u-s-agents-idUSKBN1XX07O?il=0">quash unrest in Kermanshah province</a>. Amnesty International said at least 30 were killed in the effort.</p>
      <p>Iran’s economy has been squeezed by crippling U.S. sanctions. The latest protests were sparked by rising gas prices, which nationwide has led to more than 100 deaths, the human rights group reported.</p>
