      <p>West Ham suffered a 3-2 home defeat against Tottenham on Saturday – and some of the club’s supporters were raging at their centre-forward Sebastien Haller for his performance.</p>
      <p>The Hammers returned after the international break with a loss in the Premier League at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>With Jose Mourinho taking charge for the first time, his Spurs team came out of the blocks quickly and raced into a three-goal lead by the 49th minute.</p>
      <p>Heung-Min Son and Lucas Moura cut through a poor Hammers backline in the first-half, with Harry Kane adding a third early in the second period.</p>
      <p>West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini did at least see his side respond with Michail Antonio’s goal in the 73rd minute, while Angelo Ogbonna also netted in stoppage time.</p>

      <p>A selection of West Ham supporters on social media felt that Haller offered very little quality in the final third and struggled to make an impact.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has four goals since his summer arrival for £45million (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49017405">BBC</a>), but has scored just once since August and is enduring some difficult form.</p>
      <p>He looked isolate for long spells against Spurs and failed to create any clear goalscoring opportunities.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old certainly has to try up his levels for a struggling West Ham side, as they desperately need his goals to help them try climb the table.</p>
      <p>Here are some West Ham fans on Haller:</p>
