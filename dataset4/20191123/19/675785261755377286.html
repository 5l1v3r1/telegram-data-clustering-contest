      <h1>Man City 2-1 Chelsea: 5 talking points as Riyad Mahrez makes Blues pay</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool ran out 2-1 winners over Crystal Palace on Saturday but Pep Guardiola's Manchester City kept the pressure on the Reds by guiding his side to victory over Chelsea at the Etihad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:22:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez and Kevin de Bruyne restored the good feeling around the Etihad in Manchester City's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's Citizens were thumped 3-1 by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> last time out, losing considerable ground in the Premier League title race, but responded like champions.</p>
      <p>City came from behind to beat Chelsea after N'Golo Kante got the better of Benjamin Mendy to put Frank Lampard's young Blues in front.</p>
      <p>But De Bruyne leveled for City against his former side before Mahrez put them ahead for the first time after firing past Kepa Arrizabalaga following a weaving run.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> winger Raheem Sterling had the ball in the net to make it three in stoppage time, but the effort was ruled out after a VAR check.</p>
      <p>Here are <b>five talking points</b> as victory for Manchester City moves them back to third, nine points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>

      <h3>Mateo Kovacic is a free man under Frank</h3>
      <p>Last season Chelsea fans could take or leave the Croatia international.</p>
      <p>Kovacic, then on loan from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid,</a> was nothing more than a cog in Maurzio Sarri's well-oiled machine - following the Italian's rules to the letter - and fans couldn't work out what his overall purpose was on a football pitch.</p>
      <p>This season, under Lampard, Kovacic has been given the opportunity to express himself; and the Croatian is a man reborn.</p>

      <p>Diminutive with tricky feet, Kovacic would have been earmarked by Guardiola as a man who could cause problems if allowed space to run at Manchester City's defence.</p>
      <p>And so whenever he got the ball at the Etihad, he was quickly closed down.</p>
      <p>The problem is, the midfielder can also pick a pass, and as the City defence took a step forward to apply pressure whenever he received the ball, Kovacic found a way to punish them by floating an inch-perfect pass into the feet of N'Golo Kante to fire home.</p>
      <h3>De Bruyne comes back to haunt the Blues</h3>
      <p>The Belgium international missed much of last season with injury and was a hole in Guardiola's midfield, despite them winning the Premier League.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne has returned this season and is enjoying a consistent run-out in the first team, and it's safe to say both Man City and the Belgian are benefitting.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The midfielder has more Premier League assists and has been been directly involved in more home goals than any other player in the top flight.</p>
      <p>And, on Saturday, De Bruyne only boosted his stats and his value to City fans with an equalising goal against his former side <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea.</a></p>
      <h3>He Kante stop scoring at the moment</h3>
      <p>Kante wasn't signed to score goals for Chelsea, but that doesn't mean to say the diminutive World Cup winner doesn't pop up in the box from time to time.</p>
      <p>This season the defensive midfielder has netted three goals, which isn't anything to shout home about.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But when you look at how many times the Frenchman has attempted to score this season - three times - the stat looks a little more impressive.</p>
      <p>Kante was picked out by Kovacic at the Etihad on Saturday, after he sprinted into the space that opened up in front of him, and slotted the ball home past Ederson.</p>
      <h3>Rodri is not quite the Fernandinho replacement</h3>
      <p>Arguably Manchester City's biggest problem this season is the fact they're unable to play Fernandinho in his natural position.</p>
      <p>Due to injuries, the Brazilian has been filling in at centre-back - and remarkably, he doesn't look out of place in defence.</p>
      <p>Countless times against Chelsea he showed how important he is to City, notably with a goal-saving block against Kante, preventing the Frenchman from bagging a brace.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But while Fernandinho has been more than adequate centre-back filler, he is wasted in the position.</p>
      <p>And the difference between him and the man who was brought in to replace him in the long-term, Rodri, who was subbed off for Ilkay Gundogan on Saturday, is noticeable.</p>
      <p>Rodri doesn't have the dynamism of his team-mate, and, seemingly can't fill-in at the back and 'do a job' like Fernandinho, either. No wonder Rodri looked so disappointed when his number was called.</p>
      <h3>Emerson is flattering to deceive at the Bridge</h3>
      <p>Everyone has an off-game, but Emerson was particularly poor for Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian made the wrong decision time and time again; from attempting a speculative shot at goal in the first half when a cross would have sufficed, to finding himself out of position whenever Chelsea were caught on the break.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>When Mahrez stood him up before scoring, Emerson was all too eager to commit himself and the Algerian made him pay.</p>
      <p>Mahrez danced round him with ease before slotting home, and when Emerson's numbers was called - with Reece James coming on to replace him - Chelsea fans breathed a sigh of relief inside the Etihad.</p>
