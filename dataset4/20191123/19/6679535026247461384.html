      <h1>Rape victim’s lack of mental maturity no reason to acquit convict: HC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:17:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Legal-Correspondent-680/" target="_blank">Legal Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Madras High Court pre-empted an attempt made by a rape convict to escape from the clutches of law by claiming that the victim did not have the mental maturity expected of a 40-year-old and therefore no credence should be given to her complaint.</p>
      <p>Dismissing a criminal appeal filed by him, Justice S. Vaidyanathan said, “Mental immaturity is different from mental illness. If a person is mentally ill, there would not be clarity in his/her statement. Here, the victim has given a brief statement of what had happened to her. Though, she has not got the reasoning capacity of a 40-year-old, she has got the capacity of understanding as to what is happening around her.”</p>
