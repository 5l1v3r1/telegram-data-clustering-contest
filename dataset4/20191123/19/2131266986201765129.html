      <p>Jose Mourinho enjoyed a winning start as Tottenham manager, with a 3-2 London derby triumph over West Ham at London Stadium on Sunday (NZ time). </p>
      <p>Goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane gave Tottenham their first English Premier League away win in 10 months. </p>
      <p>But Mourinho admitted he was disappointed with the way Tottenham leaked two late goals, a familiar failing for a side who have kept one clean sheet in the league all season.</p>
      <p>"I was really happy, before we conceded the two goals," said 56-year-old Mourinho. "We were playing well, bringing to the game things we had tried in training." </p>
      <p>Spurs are ninth on the league table with 17 points, with West Ham 16th on 13.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, video assistant referee (VAR) had a say in Liverpool's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and Leicester City's 2-0 triumph at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>

      <p>Liverpool grabbed another late winner through Roberto Firmino at Selhurst Park against a spirited Palace side, who were controversially denied an opener from James Tomkins, after VAR spotted a push on defender Dejan Lovren.</p>
      <p>Juergen Klopp's side rode their luck to take the lead through Sadio Mane after the break, although Wilfried Zaha gave Palace hope of a point with a goal in the 82nd minute, before Firmino intervened to make it 12 league wins out of 13.</p>
      <p>VAR, the season's perennial talking point, also had a say at Brighton, where Leicester's Jamie Vardy was ordered to retake his penalty, as the Foxes secured a fifth straight league win, after Ayoze Perez had opened the scoring for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Leicester remains eight points behind leaders Liverpool, who have 37, three ahead of Chelsea and one in front of champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>City beat Chelsea in a come-from-behind 2-1 win in Manchester. </p>
      <p>N'Golo Kante opened the scoring, before Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez scored two goals in eight minutes for the defending champions. </p>

      <p>Elsewhere, All White Chris Wood scored in Burnley's 3-0 win over Watford. </p>
      <p>Wood now has six goals from as many games and the result lifts them to sixth in the standings. </p>
      <p>The news wasn't so good for Arsenal, who dropped further off the top-four pace, after a poor result against Southampton, with boos ringing around the Emirates stadium, despite Lacazette's 96th-minute goal - his second equaliser of the game.</p>
      <p>Everton's Marco Silva is another manager feeling the heat, after his side's 2-0 home defeat by Norwich City, a result that moved the visitors off bottom spot.</p>
      <p>Wolves moved up to fifth, as Joao Moutinho and Raul Jimenez earned Nuno Espirito Santo's reinvigorated side a 2-1 win at 10-man Bournemouth, who had Simon Francis dismissed 37 minutes into his first league start since Boxing Day for a second booking.</p>
