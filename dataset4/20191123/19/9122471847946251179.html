      <h1>Video: Tua Tagovailoa Interviewed On Sideline During Alabama Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:12:55+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>While there’s no question that Tua Tagovailoa is a gifted quarterback, the most impressive trait from the 21-year-old is his leadership.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has an uphill battle ahead of him due to hip surgery. Nonetheless, the star quarterback remains confident and content with the situation he’s in.</p>
      <p>During today’s game between Alabama and Western Carolina, Tagovailoa was interviewed on the sidelines. He immediately thanked everyone that’s given him support over the past week.</p>
      <p>“I want to thank the fan base for the amount of support they’ve given me and my family. I also want to thank my mom and dad. They’ve been helping me throughout this process. Kudos to my parents for everything they’ve done for me up to this point. I can’t thank everyone enough,” he said.</p>
      <p>When asked about being in attendance just a few days after surgery, Tagovailoa admit that even sitting on the sidelines is enough to cheer him up.</p>
      <p>“Whether I’m feeling good or not, just being out here uplifts my spirit,” Tagovailoa said. “Just being out here and being able to see football again is great.”</p>
      <p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

      <p>Tua Tagovailoa can now watch his younger brother, Taulia Tagovailoa. Nick Saban has pulled Mac Jones since the Crimson Tide lead by more than 50 points against the Catamounts.</p>
      <p>It’s fair to say everyone in college football is rooting for Tagovailoa as he tries to recover from a dislocated hip.</p>
