      <p>Fani-Kayode on his Twitter page wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>“An indictment is not a conviction. An allegation remains a mere allegation until it is proven in a court of law. Allen Onyema is not a rogue or a fraudster. He is a profoundly good man and a patriot. I have no doubt that he will weather this storm and that he will be vindicated.”</blockquote>
      <p>Onyeama was charged with bank fraud and money laundering for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.</p>
      <p>The US State Department of Justice (DoJ), in a statement posted on its website on Friday, said Air Peace Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has also been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p>However, the Chairman of Air Peace, denied Allen Onyema the allegations against him.</p>
      <p>Onyeama said all money transferred to the US went through CBN, adding that the allegations were false and were in no way in line with his character as a person and as a business man</p>
      <p>Fani-Kayode, reacting said the allegation against Onyema is just mere allegation until proven guilty.</p>
      <p>The former minister assured Nigerians that Onyema is a good man and not a fraudster.</p>
