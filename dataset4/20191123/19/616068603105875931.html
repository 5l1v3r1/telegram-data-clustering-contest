      <p>The five week, 10-game slump is finally over.</p>
      <p>The West Kelowna Warriors put a six-spot on the board in one of their best 60-minutes all season, beating the visiting Salmon Arm Silverbacks 6-2 Saturday at Royal LePage Place.</p>
      <p>It was their first win since edging the same Silverbacks 2-1 at home back on Oct. 18.</p>
      <p>"Everything that we've been talking about finally fell into place," said Warriors head coach Brandon West.</p>
      <p>"I thought we played really well with the lead. Even when they started pouring it on, I saw some good things from our group."</p>
      <p>West said the coaches put some 17-year-olds in some situations they normally wouldn't be.</p>
      <p>Two of those, Tyler Cristall and John Evans were dominant all night with linemate Brendan Pigeon.</p>
      <p>The line was dangerous every time they stepped on the ice, combining for 4 goals and 10 points.</p>
      <p>They got things going right off the opening faceoff, playing tic-tac-toe down low before working it to Evans who beat Ethan Langenegger from in close 14 seconds in.</p>
      <p>It was the first time the Warriors had opened the scoring in 11 games, and the first time they had held a lead of any kind over that same stretch.</p>
      <p>Evans made it 2-0 late in the first when his shot from the bottom of the left circle found a way through Langenegger, who argued briefly he had been bumped before the puck went in.</p>
      <p>"John and Tyler have some history playing together and I thought Brendan has been one of our most consistent guys from day one.</p>
      <p>"He's a winger playing centre and he compliments those guys real well. Those three shared the puck all night long, making great unselfish plays, and finding ways to be leaders."</p>
      <p>The Warriors dominated the first period and the early going of the second.</p>
      <p>But, a fight four minutes into the second seemed to give the Silverbacks a bit of life, then a goal three minutes later tipped the momentum in their direction.</p>
      <p>Instead of giving into the pressure, the Warriors were able to push back, and were rewarded when Max Bulawka crashed the net and deflected home a pass from Lucas Cullen.</p>
      <p>Salmon Arm again cut the deficit to one three minutes into the third, but again, it was the Warriors who were able to respond.</p>
      <p>Cristall rang a shot off the goal post, but the rebound went straight to Pigeon who deposited his third on a power play.</p>
      <p>Cristall and Cullen put it away with two more power play goals.</p>
      <p>Cullen's brought everyone to their feet. After leaving the penalty box, he raced into the Salmon Arm end, stripped a defender of the puck then from in close, pulled the puck back between his legs and flipped it past Langenegger.</p>
      <p>Cullen had gone 12 games without a goal.</p>
      <p>The six goal outburst also matched their total from the last four games combined.</p>
      <p>The Warriors, who completed a run of three games in four nights, and endured a lot of travel over the past four weeks, get a well deserved break.</p>
      <p>They don't return to the ice until next Friday when Powell River come calling.</p>
