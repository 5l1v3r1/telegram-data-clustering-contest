      <p><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Midcourt"><b>Midcourt</b></a> continued his hot streak Saturday for trainer John Shirreffs, wiring the Grade 3, $100,000 Native Diver at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>The win was a fourth straight for Midcourt, a 4-year-old Midnight Lute gelding, and came in his first try in a graded stakes race. He entered off a neck win over <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Two_Thirty_Five"><b>Two Thirty Five</b></a> – one of the three rivals he faced Saturday – in the black-type Comma to the Top Stakes on Oct. 27 at Santa Anita Park.</p>
      <p>There was no such close finish Saturday for Midcourt. He broke from the No. 2 post and went to the front, setting fractions of :23.55, :47.61 and 1:11.54.</p>
      <p>Jockey Victor Espinoza pushed the button on Midcourt through the far turn of the 1 1/8-mile dirt feature. The C R K Stable runner drew away from there, then cruised home to score by five lengths over runner-up <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Extra_Hope"><b>Extra Hope</b></a> for a win that returned $7.60.</p>

      <p>“It wasn’t the way I expected," Shirreffs said. "I didn’t think they’d take off that soon and go to the lead. But Victor rode him great and he wanted to run today.</p>
      <p>"He’s been training well but there’s always a step up they have to take in the afternoons. You hope there’s a realization then. He’s doing really well right now so we’ll go on to Santa Anita and see what we can do.”</p>
      <p>Next up for Midcourt could be the 1 1/16-mile San Antonio Stakes (G2), which has run the last two years on Dec. 26.</p>
      <p>Two Thirty Five came home third Saturday ahead of last-place Roadster, who went off the 4-5 favorite.</p>
      <p>The Native Diver marked a fourth-straight winless effort for Roadster since his Santa Anita Derby (G1) win April 6. Since then, the Bob Baffert-trained 3-year-old was 15<sup>th </sup>on May 4 in the Kentucky Derby, second June 16 in Santa Anita’s Affirmed Stakes (G3) and, after a layoff, second Nov. 2 in Santa Anita’s black-type Damascus Stakes.</p>
