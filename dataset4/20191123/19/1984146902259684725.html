      <p>The new series of Strictly Come Dancing has given us loads to talk about but there isn't too much of it left now.</p>
      <p>So far we've had Dev and Michelle's shock exits which sent Twitter into meltdown, Craig STILL not giving a 10 and of course Chris Ramsey's dance to Let's Get Ready to Rhumble and errr his bulge!</p>
      <p>Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman have once again been at the helm of the BBC show with Bruno, Shirley, Craig and new judge Motsi on the panel, while there has been no clear frontrunner for this year's Glitterball, with the top spot on the leaderboard swapping each week.</p>
      <p>Before long we'll find out which celeb will follow in the footsteps of Jill Halfpenny, Caroline Flack, Harry Judd, Alesha Dixon and last year's winner Stacey Dooley to become <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> champion for 2019.</p>
      <h3>When is the Strictly Come Dancing final?</h3>
      <p>The Final of Strictly will take place on Saturday, December 14 and of course be screened on BBC1. There will be no separate results show on the Sunday.</p>
      <p>All of the action and the big announcement will happen on the Saturday.</p>
