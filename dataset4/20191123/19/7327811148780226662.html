      <p>MAYS LANDING, New Jersey -- Two southern New Jersey men have pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for setting <a href="https://abc7ny.com/man-set-on-fire-while-sleeping-at-friends-nj-home/5232366/">another man on fire as he slept</a> at a friend's home in what police described as a "prank that went terribly, terribly wrong."</p>
      <p>The Atlantic County prosecutor said 23-year-old Brandon Perez of Hammonton and 24-year-old David Sult of Mays Landing entered the pleas Thursday in exchange for a recommendation of five-year sentences.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the defendants originally maintained that the 27-year-old victim was burned accidentally by an electronic smoking device, but an investigation concluded that lighter fluid was sprayed on him and ignited.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said the victim had severe burns to his back. He told NJ Advance Media that he lost 30 pounds and endured multiple skin grafts and blood transfusions.</p>
