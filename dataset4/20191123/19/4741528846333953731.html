      <h1>US court releases Onyema’s transactions details, issues arrest warrant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:50:06+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/abiola-odutola/" target="_blank">Abiola Odutola</a></address>
      <p>A United States court has released the details of the transactions of the Chairman, <b>Air Peace Limited</b>, Allen Onyema over alleged money laundering and bank fraud in the US, as it issued a warrant of arrest against him.</p>
      <p><b>The <a href="https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/warrant-of-arrest.jpg">warran</a></b>t, which was signed by an American magistrate of US District Court of Northern District of Georgia, Justin Anand on November 19, authorised U.S. Marshals Service to take Onyema into custody.</p>
      <p><b>What it implies:</b> The development means Onyema may be arrested anywhere in Nigeria or the US. The reason is that the US and Nigeria have a mutual legal assistance policy that allows both countries to extradite suspects facing criminal charges. Several Nigerians have been sent to the U.S. to stand trial for alleged fraud.</p>

      <p><b>Case study:</b> In August, one Temitayo Fatumbi was extradited from Nigeria and sentenced to 46 months for his role in an $8.3 million Medicare fraud scheme and related money laundering.</p>
      <p><b>Fatumbi was found guilty</b> for his role in Durable Medical Equipment (DME), which was fraudulently billed to Medicare for DME but was not medically necessary.</p>

      <p><b>There are chances that</b> the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will wade in considering previous cases it had arrested people wanted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation for fraud or other criminal allegations.</p>
      <p><b>Onyema’s case comes as</b> U.S. authorities are recording back-to-back successes in their clampdown on Nigerians suspected of fraudulent activities there.</p>
      <p><b>Nairametrics could not confirm</b> if US authorities have sought extradition of Onyema as part of efforts to execute a warrant of arrest issued against him.</p>

        <b>What Nigeria/US extradition says …</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/06/nigeriaus-extradition-treaty-what-the-law-says/amp/">Nigeria/US treaty</a> stated that “contracting Parties engage to deliver up to each other, under certain circumstances and conditions stated in the present Treaty, and those persons who, being accused or convicted of any of the crimes or offenses enumerated in Article 3, committed within the jurisdiction of the one Party, shall be found within the territory of the other Party.”</p>
      <p>Article 9 stipulates “the extradition shall take place only if the evidence be found sufficient, according to the laws of the High Contracting Party applied to, either to justify the committal of the prisoner for trial, in case the crime or offense had been committed in the territory of such High Contracting Party,</p>
