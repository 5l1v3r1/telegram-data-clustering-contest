          <p>Arsenal have now gone 5 matches in the Premier League and 6 in all competitions without a victory. The pressure continues to build on the team and more so on their boss, Unai Emery. 3 points in 5 matches is simply not good enough for a side that once regularly challenged for the Premier League title.</p>

                <h3>Alexandre Lacazette peculiarly reacts to scoring equaliser for Arsenal vs Southampton</h3>
                <p>With the game in its dying minutes, Lacazette fired one in to find the back of the net. He had scored both of Arsenal’s goals in the match. However, rather than celebrating, he looked down and touched the ground. It was as if he were frustrated that the match had to come to that point where the team had to dig deep just to get a point.</p>

                          <p>Earlier in the match, Southampton took the lead with a <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/arsenal-defence-caught-napping-by-quick-free-kick-as-danny-ings-fires-to-give-southampton-the-lead/">cleverly taken free kick</a>. With Arsenal defenders caught napping, Danny Ings scored in the 8<sup>th</sup> minute to give the Saints the lead. Lacazette then equalised 10 minutes later.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>James Ward-Prowse then put the visitors on top again in the 71<sup>st</sup> minute only for Lacazette to cancel it late in the match. This match clearly exposes Unai Emery’s inept tactics and will give more credibility to the demands for his sacking. With Pochettino already gone, could Unai Emery be the next Premier League manager to lose his job?</p>
