      <h1>Nebraska Announces Update For RB Wan’Dale Robinson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:55:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>When the Nebraska Cornhuskers take the field this afternoon against the Maryland Terrapins, they’ll be without standout running back/wide receiver Wan’Dale Robinson.</p>
      <p>Nebraska didn’t have Robinson last weekend against Wisconsin, which certainly hurt the team’s production on offense.</p>
      <p>Robinson has been one of the top playmakers for the Huskers this season. His 326 rushing yards and five total touchdowns are third on the team, while his 453 receiving yards are second on the team.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for the Cornhuskers, Robinson is not even on the team’s travel roster for today’s contest.</p>

      <p>Adrian Martinez will have to rely on Kanawai Noa and Jack Stoll in the passing game. The former has been impressive over the past three weeks, meanwhile the latter has been a reliable option for the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>If Nebraska loses to Maryland today, the program will be eliminated from bowl contention for the third-straight year.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 3:30 p.m. ET from Maryland Stadium.</p>
      <p>The game will be broadcast on the Big Ten Network.</p>
