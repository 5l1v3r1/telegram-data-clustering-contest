      <p>Newcastle Untied’s young prospect Bobby Clark is reportedly attracting interest from several teams after impressing at academy level – and some of the club’s supporters on Twitter to demand he stays at St James’ Park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7714221/Tottenham-join-race-sign-Newcastle-starlet-Bobby-Clark.html">According to the Daily Mail</a>, Premier League outfit Tottenham have joined the race to try sign the 14-year-old prodigy.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Newcastle manager Steve Bruce rates him highly and views him as the best schoolboy prospect at the club.</p>
      <p>The report explains that the midfielder is set for a first England youth call up next month with the nation’s Under-15s squad.</p>
      <p>Clark has already played for the Magpies at Under-18 age level despite his age and is the son of Newcastle star Lee Clark.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the report adds that he would prefer to stay where he is despite interest from the likes of Spurs, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Bayern Munich.</p>

      <p>A selection of Newcastle supporters on social media have responded to the speculation around rising star Clark and stated they don’t want to lose their upcoming talents.</p>
      <p>Brothers Sean and Matty Longstaff are brilliant examples in the last year that the academy can produce quality eventually for the first-team.</p>
      <p>Here are some Newcastle fans on Clark:</p>
