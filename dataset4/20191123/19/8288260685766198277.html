      <p>Martin Lewis has told shoppers how to get a £29 IKEA 6ft real Christmas tree - for just £9.</p>
      <p>The MoneySavingExpert.com founder has revealed how to bag the festive favourite for under a tenner.</p>
      <p>MSE guru Martin, who boasts his own ITV1 show, as well as appearing on the likes of This Morning and Lorraine, spoke out on TV.</p>
      <p>The financial expert said: "Every year this tends to be very popular. Go into your nearest Ikea and if you buy a £29 real Christmas, you’ll get a £20 voucher to spend at any participating store between Monday 13 January and Sunday 23 February next year."</p>
      <p>IKEA operate Midlands stores in Coventry and Wednesbury.</p>
      <p>"So it’s effectively a £9 tree as long as you’d have spent £20 in the New Year anyway," Mr Lewis continued.</p>
      <p>"Officially, it's on till Tuesday 24 December, but in previous years the trees have sold out before this - so go quick if you want one, as it’s likely to be popular.</p>
      <p>"The trees are all of the same variety (Abies Nordmanniana) and they're typically about 170cm (5ft 7in) tall, but do vary in size, and there’s no delivery option, so do think about how you’ll get it home."</p>
      <p>The deal tends to be very popular and all people have to do is head to the IKEA store and buy a £29 tree.</p>
      <p>You then get a £20 voucher to spend in store next year.</p>
