      <p>Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli left viewers stunned on Saturday night when he opened the show by singing!</p>
      <p>Yes, while he is of course best known for his dancing, Bruno took centre stage in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> ballroom to kick off this week's live show with a performance of Can't Take My Eyes Off You, flanked by backing dancers adorned with feathers.</p>
      <p>Host Tess Daly described the always excitable Italian as a "man of many talents," but viewers at home were more torn on his performance.</p>
      <p>One reacted "Bruno, please stick to dancing, and judging," while another tweeted "Ok, but we can't just carry on after Bruno's singing. We, as a nation, need time to deal."</p>
      <p>Former Strictly pro James Jordan even had his say posting "I don’t get it??? The singing or the pink or the dance. Is it a nod to something? I love Bruno but..." <br/>Others praised Bruno and Strictly, viewing the performance as the perfect response to the complaints about the show's first ever same sex dance.</p>
      <p>One happy viewer wrote "Strictly’s two fingers up to all the homophobic complainers is f***** EVERYTHING. Bruno singing Andy Williams. Pink suits. Top hats. Feathers. It’s a 10 from me," and another Do you think this is the BBC saying eff you to the 200 bigots who claimed about same sex dancers?"</p>
