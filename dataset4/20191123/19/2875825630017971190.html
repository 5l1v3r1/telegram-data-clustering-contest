      <p>Strictly Come Dancing viewers were stunned tonight when Bruno Tonioli started singing.</p>
      <p>The Italian judge, who is known for his dancing and choreography, opened the show with a rendition of Frank Sinatra's 'I Love You Baby'.</p>
      <p>Horrified viewers watched in disbelief as Bruno belted out the classic song during a very cheesy opening number.</p>
      <p>Wearing a white tux and white tie, Bruno emerged amongst some feathers held up by the professional dancers.</p>
      <p>Bruno got a standing ovation from the crowd - but did not get as warm a reception from most of the viewers at home who labelled it 'painful and ugly'.</p>

      <p>When Bruno went back to the judging table, presenter Tess Daly called him a "man of many talents".</p>
      <p>Co-host Claudia Winkleman added: "Thank you Bruno. That was just the right amount of understated we need after Blackpool.</p>
      <p>Strictly viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to complain after watching Bruno's performance, including some of his biggest fans.</p>
