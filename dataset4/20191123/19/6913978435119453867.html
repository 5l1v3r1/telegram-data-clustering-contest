      <p><b>KOLKATA —</b> A sparkling century by Virat Kohli and Ishant Sharma's four wickets put India on the cusp of a big win over Bangladesh on just the second day of their maiden day-night Test on Saturday.<br/><br/>The tourists were 152 for six at stumps in their second innings, still needing 89 runs to avoid an innings defeat in India's pink ball Test debut in Kolkata.<br/><br/>Kohli made 136 as India, who lead the two-match series 1-0, declared their innings on 347 for nine and then Ishant rattled the Bangladesh batting.<br/><br/>Ishant struck early to leave Bangladesh tottering at 13 for four before Mushfiqur Rahim made an unbeaten 59 to take the five-day match to day three.<br/><br/>Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah, who retired hurt on 39 with what seemed a hamstring strain, put on 69 runs for the fifth wicket to offer some resistence against a persistent Indian pace attack.<br/><br/>Mushfiqur stayed on to complete his second half-century of the series with concussion substitute Taijul Hasan losing his wicket for 11 to paceman Umesh Yadav and umpires called for end of play.<br/><br/>Mushfiqur survived two leg before wicket decisions that went against him but he successfully reviewed both the calls in his favor.<br/><br/>Ishant trapped Shadman Islam lbw for nought and then claimed skipper Mominul Haque for a second zero in the same match.<br/><br/>The pace spearhead, who claimed five wickets in the first innings, bowled at a lively pace as one of his rising deliveries hit Mohammad Mithun on the helmet but the batsman went on to complete his innings.<br/><br/>Bangladesh were forced to take two concussion substitutes in Mehidy Hasan and Taijul for Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan who were hit on the helmet by Shami on day one.<br/><br/>Earlier Kohli aced the pink ball Test as he completed his 27th century before falling to a stunning catch by Taijul.<br/><br/>Left-arm spinner Taijul made it count with a wicket of Ajinkya Rahane for 51 and then took a diving catch at fine leg to send back Kohli off paceman Ebadat Hossain.<br/><br/>India lost a few quick wickets, but Wriddhiman Saha and Shami knocked a few boundaries and a six by the last man in pulverised the Bangladesh bowlers.<br/><br/>Pacemen Al-Amin Hossain and Ebadat took three wickets each.<br/><br/>Kohli stood out with his prolific scoring as he put on crucial partnerships including a 99-run stand with overnight partner Rahane.<br/><br/>The star batsman smashed fast bowler Abu Jayed for four straight boundaries in one over before finishing with 18 fours in his 194-ball stay.<br/><br/><b>Scoreboard<br/><br/>Bangladesh</b> <b>1st innings</b> 106<br/><br/><b>India 1st innings</b> (overnight 174-3)<br/><br/>M.
