      <p>Ryan Lowe enthused over Plymouth Argyle’s all-round display after they defeated Bradford City 2-1 at Home Park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims are up to eighth in League Two</a> after winning four of their last five fixtures.</p>
      <p>They took a 2-0 lead into half-time against high-flying Bradford after goals from Byron Moore and Joe Edwards.</p>
      <p>A 51st minute own goal from Argyle defender Niall Canavan opened up the possibility of a comeback from City.</p>
      <p>Argyle stuck to their task, though, and were able to follow up their 1-0 win at table-topping Forest Green Rovers with another impressive victory.</p>
      <p>The only criticism Lowe had of his players was that they did not finish off Bradford when they had the chance.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims played some excellent football in the closing stages of the first half and could have led by three or four goals.</p>
      <p>As it was, Bradford regrouped after a double substitution and change of tactics at the interval.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We knew it was going to be tough. Bradford weren’t coming here just to roll over, they were coming here to be effective.</p>
      <p>“I think when a team changes shape at half-time, it shows that you have done something well and you have done something good.</p>
      <p>“I thought some of the football we played today was terrific – some of the moves, some of the passing, some of the patterns of play.</p>
      <p>“We could have finished them off really. We could have had four or five, but they (Bradford) have put their bodies on the line.”</p>

      <p>Lowe continued: “I’m disappointed with the own goal, it was a bit harsh for us.</p>
      <p>“But when you beat top of the league 1-0, and then you beat third place 2-1, I think you have got to be happy.”</p>
      <p>Had it not been for Canavan’s unfortunate own goal, it would have been a fourth clean sheet in Argyle’s last five league games.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We work hard throughout the week on defensive displays, attacking displays, midfield displays.</p>
      <p>“Some of the performances of the boys, let alone the back three, was phenomenal.</p>
      <p>“That’s what we want and that’s what they are giving us, but we are going to come up against teams who are throwing balls in the mixer from back to front, looking for fouls.</p>
      <p>“Our lads are withstanding that now. They can deal with it, which is good because no-one can ever turn around and say ‘Just put the ball in the box, they can’t defend’.</p>
      <p>“We can, and then we are going to get on the counter attack, as we have shown.</p>
      <p>“We could have been a little bit more ruthless with our counter attacking but, listen, I can’t complain. Every single one of them, to a man, was different class.”</p>
      <p>Moore opened the scoring for Argyle as early as the fifth minute when he slotted home from close range at the second attempt.</p>
      <p>His initial effort was blocked by Bradford goalkeeper Richard O’Donnell but Moore then tucked away the rebound.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s second goal came in the 25th minute and was the result of some excellent play from right wing-back Joe Edwards.</p>

      <p>First, Edwards closed down O’Donnell and forced him into a rushed, poorly-struck clearance from inside his own box.</p>
      <p>Then, after receiving the ball from Argyle team-mates Joel Grant, Edwards sent a low shot into the bottom corner of the net.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “That’s what he does, Joe. He’s a willing runner and he’s a fantastic lad.</p>
      <p>“He has shown that all season and played in different positions. He’s making that right wing-back spot his own now.</p>
      <p>“Every time he plays there he scores I think,” added Lowe, referring to the fact that Edwards netted twice when in the same role during the 2-2 draw at Crawley Town in September.</p>
      <p>“He has jinked away a little bit there and slotted it in with his left foot. Superb.”</p>
