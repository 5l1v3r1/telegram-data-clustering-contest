      <p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — LeBron James scored on a driving layup with 1:30 left to put the Los Angeles ahead to stay as the Lakers held off the Memphis Grizzlies 109-108 Saturday night for their seventh straight victory.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies had a final chance with the ball and 1.3 seconds left. Jaren Jackson Jr. went sprawling trying to corral Kyle Anderson’s pass inbounding the ball.</p>
      <p>James finished with 30 points. Anthony Davis added 22, Rajon Rondo had 14, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 12 and Dwight Howard had 10.</p>
      <p>Rookie Ja Morant led Memphis with 26 points. Jae Crowder added 21, Jackson finished with 20, Dillon Brooks had 12 and Anderson 10.</p>
      <p>The Lakers showed the effects of winning in Oklahoma City on Friday night. James made clear on social media he had trouble getting a nap before tipoff with their hotel across the street from the FedExForum where No. 16 Memphis beat Mississippi 87-86 earlier Saturday.</p>
      <p>They never led in the first half and trailed by as much as 15 in the second quarter. The Lakers got going in the third and opened the fourth jumping out to their biggest lead of the game at 94-87.</p>

      <p>The young Grizzlies took a 105-100 lead on a tip-in by Brandon Clarke with 3:24 to go. Davis tied it up with a 3 with 2:00 remaining, James hit his layup for the go-ahead bucket, and Davis followed by tipping in a James’ miss for a 109-105 lead with 53.5 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Morant drove for a layup with 28 seconds left to pull Memphis within a point. James missed a jumper with the Grizzlies grabbing the rebound to set up the final try.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies lost their third straight on a night they wore their Vancouver teal uniforms for the first time as throwbacks celebrating their 25th NBA season along with a throwback court.</p>
      <p>Memphis led 35-25 after the first quarter and 63-55 at halftime.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Lakers: Rondo played hours after the NBA fined him $35,000 for the foul that got him ejected from the Lakers’ win over the Thunder. He was ejected after kicking guard Dennis Schroder in the groin area and not leaving the court in a timely manner after being thrown out. Rondo also had six assists and three rebounds. … James snapped his seven-game streak with 10 or more assists, the longest in his career, with just four assists. It was the longest for the Lakers since Magic Johnson had 10 straight in 1990-91.</p>
      <p>Grizzlies: They started the game hitting their first eight 3-pointers before Jackson missed with 10:38 left in the second. … They outscored the Lakers 52-46 in the paint and outrebounded them 47-40.</p>
