      <h1>Twitter can't handle Finn Russell's performance versus Munster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:22:58+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>The exceptional individual performance of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> playmaker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/finn-russell/">Finn Russell</a> in Thomond Park this evening has left digital jaws on the metaphorical floor.</p>
      <p>Racing drew 21 – 21 with their hosts, but it was arguably the virtuoso turn of their star ten that was stood out in yet another European thriller in Limerick.</p>
      <p>After a disappointing Rugby World Cup, the mercurial Scot appeared eager to make-up for any lost reputation with his Parisian colleagues.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old took just eighteen minutes to silence the Thomond Park faithful with an early contender for the try of the season. A perfectly weighted grubber that nutmegged a rapidly approaching <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> defender was regathered and he strolled over to the left of the posts.</p>

      <p>It didn’t end there either. A stunning break seven minutes into the second half cut Munster in half and a perfectly timed pass put Argentine flyer <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/juan-imhoff/">Juan Imhoff</a> in under the posts.</p>

      <p>It’s been a rollercoaster year for the Glasgowegian pivot. He was named Man of the Match in the memorable 38-38 draw against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> earlier this year, a contest in which <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> rallied from a 31-point deficit.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> did not go to plan however. The Bridge of Allan born flyhalf started in Scotland’s opening round defeat against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> at RWC 2019, as well as in their second match against Samoa. He did not feature in the match-day 23 against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/russia">Russia</a> but did start in their final pool game loss against Japan.</p>
      <p>He played in four of Scotland’s five matches at RWC 2015, starting at fly-half in all four, but did not feature in the pool match against South Africa.</p>
