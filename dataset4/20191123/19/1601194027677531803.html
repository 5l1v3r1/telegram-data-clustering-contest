      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> stars are given their first names when they are signed to the company and then ready to debut on the NXT brand. This means that they are given named that suit their characters in developmental, but often these names don't suit them on the main roster.</p>
      <p>There have been many stars over the past few years who have been promoted and had their names changed when they've debuted on RAW or SmackDown, including Alexander Rusev, Big E Langston, Antonio Cesaro and Elias Samson.</p>
      <p>Many stars have had their names shortened over the years because it's much easier for WWE to copyright or because it's less of a mouthful for some of the WWE Universe. 2019 has been quite a strange year for WWE's main roster which has included a number of interesting name changes.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/the-viking-raiders">Viking Raiders</a> have had quite an interesting year in WWE since they now hold the RAW Tag Team Championships heading into this year's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> where they will be representing the company's flagship brand in a match against The New Day and The Undisputed Era.</p>
      <p>The Viking Raiders started their year in NXT as The War Raiders before they were brought up to the main roster and debuted as The Viking Experience. This was later changed the following year to make them The Viking Raiders, whilst the two stars themselves also went through a name change since they were called Rowe and Hanson in NXT and are now called Erik and Ivar.</p>
      <p>Raymond Rowe was his real name and he competed under it in NXT but it seems that when he and Hanson were moved up to RAW back in April, just weeks after this year's WrestleMania.</p>
