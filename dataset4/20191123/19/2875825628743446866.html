      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/louis-walsh">Louis Walsh</a> says the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/westlife">Weslife</a> boys have much more to give after they landed back at the top of the charts.</p>
      <p>Music mogul Louis formed the band 20 years ago, and now they're back in the No1 spot with their comeback album Spectrum.</p>
      <p>Louis exclusively told Mirror Online: "The boys have worked so hard on this album. They’ve put everything into it. They deserve it.</p>
      <p>"I knew that people would want to hear Westlife again. The success of the tour showed that this summer and the album hitting No1 more than confirms it. They’ve got a big future ahead. There is more to come from Westlife."</p>

      <p>Spectrum is the Irish boyband's first No1 album in 12 years.</p>
      <p>Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne, Mark Feehily and Kian Egan has also made history by being officially confirmed as the biggest selling Irish band in the UK in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Spectrum has shifted more than three times as many as the No.2 album, Courage by Celine Dion in its first week of release.</p>
      <p>The 11 track album, co-written by Westlife and superstar hitmakers <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> and Steve Mac, sees the band on their finest form, showcasing their stunning vocals with a collection of fresh pop anthems and soul-stirring ballads.</p>
      <p>It includes the uptempo first comeback single Hello My Love as well as the recently released My Blood.</p>

      <p>The chart success cements Westlife’s triumphant return to music.</p>
      <p>The boys said: "It is amazing. It means more to us now than at any time in our careers. We’ve been blown away by the reaction to the new album.</p>
      <p>"None of us can quite believe that we’re back at Number 1. It has been a great year for us and the resounding success of the album really does round it off.</p>
      <p>"We want to say a massive thank you to our fans. We’re looking forward to celebrating with them at our stadium tour next summer."</p>
      <p>They added: "We have all driven by trying to create the best album of our careers. We wanted to make something current, something that feels fresh.</p>

      <p>"The huge success of our comeback single Hello My Love gave us the confidence that our fans and the public were completely up for a new album of original songs.</p>
      <p>"We’ve probably had more input into this album than any other in our careers. We have all driven by trying to create the best album of our careers. We wanted to make something current, something that feels fresh.”</p>
      <p>Westlife announced their return to music in October 2018 when they signed a new deal with Virgin EMI.</p>
