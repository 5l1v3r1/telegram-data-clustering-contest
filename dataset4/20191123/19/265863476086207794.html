      <p>Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell have taken the music world by storm and now Billie has made Grammy history. At 17-years-old, Billie has become the youngest musical artist to score nominations in all four of the general field categories. Billie has a total of six Grammy nominations while her brother Finneas has five. Billie has been nominated for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Solo Performance, and Best New Artist.</p>
      <p>Working with her brother Finneas who co-writes, produces, engineers and plays music she has found a successful collaborator. Finneas has been nominated for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical.

      <p>Billie and Finneas have left their stamp on the music world and one can only imagine what the future will hold for this brother and sister team. Since Billie isn’t even 18 yet, it’s a true advantage and blessing that she entered success while under the protection of her older brother and wasn’t left thrown into stardom without a close-knit family circle to protect her.</p>
      <p>If six Grammy nominations before the age of 18 aren’t enough to blow Billie’s mind, she continues to get more awards and accolades for her music. In addition to being Grammy-nominated, Billie has been nominated for Teen Choice Awards, MTV Europe Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, American Music Awards, People Choice Awards, MuchMusic Awards, NRJ Music Awards, iHeartRadio Music Awards, and the Aria Music Award.</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish has also been named Variety’s Hitmaker of the Year.</p>
      <p>Billie is already challenging what it means to be famous and what fans not only expect and demand from their idols. At 17-years-old, Billie bring a new and fresh perspective not only to her music but to the idea of being a celebrity. She’s made it a rule not to sign autographs because people resell them.</p>
      <p>What do you think of Billie’s new approach to fame and her making history as the youngest person to be Grammy-nominated in all main categories?</p>
