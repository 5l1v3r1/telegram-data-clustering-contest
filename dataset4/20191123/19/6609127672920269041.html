      <p>Cops now believe he may have travelled to Belfast in Northern Ireland by ferry around 6am on September 22 and thereafter, potentially to the Dublin area via train.</p>
      <p>Maraj is described as Afghan, around 5 ft 4in tall, of slim build and has short black hair.</p>
      <p>When last seen, he was wearing a pink/red and white polo shirt and a black bomber style jacket.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland statement added: "We believe he has relatives in the Cork area and it's possible he may have travelled into the Republic of Ireland in order to reunite with his family.</p>
      <p>"Officers are seeking any information which could assist them in locating Maraj to ensure he is safe and well."</p>
      <p>If anyone has seen Maraj they are urged to call police in Dumfries, Scotland, via 101, quoting incident number 2608 of 22 September 2019.</p>
