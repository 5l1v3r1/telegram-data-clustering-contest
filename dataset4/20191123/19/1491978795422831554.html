        <i>Dismissal from 2020 festival followed complaint by staff member over behaviour</i>
      </p>
      <p>A conductor has been sacked by the UK’s top opera festival after it found “clear evidence of inappropriate behaviour”.</p>
      <p>Gareth Hancock, 53, was slated to work on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/glyndebourne">Glyndebourne</a> festival’s production of Dialogues des Carmélite next year but his contract for 2020 was withdrawn following an internal investigation after a complaint was brought to its HR department.</p>
      <p><a href="https://slippedisc.com/2019/11/exclusive-glyndebourne-sacks-a-conductor/">Slipped Disc</a>, a classical music blog which first reported the conductor’s dismissal, said the complaint concerned a text message to a singer and that “no physical act was involved”.</p>
      <p>Hancock, who is also head of opera at the Royal Academy of Music and coaches young singers at the Royal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera">Opera</a> House, is a married father of two.</p>
      <p>In a statement, a spokeswoman said: “In October 2019, an employee brought a complaint of inappropriate behaviour by Gareth Hancock to Glyndebourne’s HR department, who immediately alerted senior management and launched an internal investigation.</p>
      <p>“During the investigation, clear evidence of inappropriate behaviour from Gareth Hancock came to light, and Glyndebourne took the decision to withdraw his 2020 contract.”</p>
      <p>The statement said no further evidence of similar behaviour towards other employees had come to light.</p>
      <p>The statement continued: “Glyndebourne regards as our highest priority the safety and right to dignity of all our staff and does not tolerate or condone any behaviour that contravenes our policies and standards.</p>
      <p>“Glyndebourne is a member of the Guardians programme set up by the Old Vic, has a written dignity at work policy that is shared with all employees, and a safeguarding policy outlining 10 Principles to Encourage Safer and More Supportive Working Practices in Theatre. Glyndebourne has also undertaken a project in 2019 looking at all aspects of working culture.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Royal Academy of Music said it was unable to comment at this time. The Royal Opera House has also been approached for a comment.</p>
      <p>The Guardian has been unable to contact Hancock.</p>
