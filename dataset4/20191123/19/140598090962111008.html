      <p>Marco Silva held talks over his future with Everton majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and club directors in the wake of the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/norwich-beat-everton-goodison-park-mouting-pressure-onto-marco/"> 2-0 home defeat to Norwich City</a>.</p>
      <p>Sources close to Silva feared he was in danger of losing his job following the loss but it appears he might be given a little more time - with Everton away to high-flying Leicester City next Sunday.</p>
      <p>The talks followed a horrible defeat with Everton fans joining in with visiting supporters to sing “you’re getting sacked in the morning” amid a toxic atmosphere inside Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>The Everton hierarchy have been desperate to support Silva and are extremely reluctant to make the change. They met soon after the final whistle with Moshiri holding discussions with chairman Bill Kenwright, chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale and director of football Marcel Brands. Silva also later joined them, it is understood.</p>
      <p>If Silva is sacked a serious option could be the return of David Moyes, possibly initially until the end of the season, six years after he quit Everton to join Manchester United. It is believed Moyes would be keen to return to the club where he managed for 11 years.</p>
      <p>The problem for Everton, should they decide to make a change, is the lack of available candidates to succeed Silva but the situation is becoming critical. There is sympathy for the Portuguese, who was appointed in June 2018 and led Everton to eighth place last season but they are languishing in 15<sup>th</sup> and are just four points outside the relegation zone. Silva accepts they are under-achieving having now lost at home to two of the promoted clubs.</p>
      <p>Such has been the scrutiny on Silva that it appears he has almost been operating on a game-by-game basis and seemed to earn himself a reprieve before the international break with the 2-1 win away to Southampton. However losing to Norwich, who started the day bottom of the table, is a serious blow to his chances of keeping his job. But, even so, he might carry on for at least one more week.</p>
