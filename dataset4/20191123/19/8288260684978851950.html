      <p>And Helen, who plays Rosie Webster on the ITV1 soap, issued a passionate response as she clapped back at a social media user.</p>
      <p>Helen's staunch defence came after being accused of 'moaning' about her children.</p>
      <p>One Instagram user told Helen to 'buckle up and get on with it' - but the soap star says she's being honest so that her followers can identify with her.</p>

      <p>Helen, a former I'm A Celebrity campmate, posted the row on her Instagram stories for others to see, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/helen-flanagan-defends-herself-after-17306050">M.E.N.</a></p>
      <p>"Direct messages like this," she said.</p>
      <p>"I have friends very close to me who have struggled to conceive."</p>
      <p>Helen was told: "Stop ranting about your kids! Buckle up and get on with it.</p>
      <p>"There are some people who are unable to conceive then you have people like yourself moaning.</p>
      <p>"It's part of the process. Get on with it and stop ranting which is what you're doing."</p>
      <p>Helen, from Bury, replied: "Actually I am honest on my Instagram so other mums can identify with me and feel less on their own.</p>
      <p>"I am supportive of other women."</p>

      <p>Helen, 29, shared on her Instagram stories a photo of herself looking glum with the words: "To get any peace at the moment I have to lock myself in the toilet ... any other mums do the same?"</p>
      <p>In another frank post she shared a picture of a chocolate cake with the caption: "Delilah screamed so much in the car today I was so stressed I had to stop at Costa drive thru and inhale this."</p>
      <p>Helen's eldest daughter Matilda is four and she welcomed her second child with Celtic footballer Scott Sinclair Delilah in June last year.</p>
