      <p>Alex Scott had a night to forget on Strictly Come Dancing after an awkward wardrobe malfunction.</p>
      <p>The former footballer became entangled with her professional partner Neil Jones at the end of their Argentine Tango.</p>
      <p>Red-faced Alex was forced to cling hold of Neil as he carried her across the dance floor to the judges' table.</p>
      <p>Worried presenter Tess Daly asked: "Are you stuck together? We have a microphone malfunction. Or is it a sequin malfunction."</p>
      <p>With the pair unable to free themselves, Tess eventually managed to save the day by pulling them apart.</p>

      <p>"You're free," cried a triumphant Tess as Alex tried to get her breath back.</p>
      <p>Giving some words of comfort, the host said: "Oh darling. These things happen. It's live television."</p>
      <p>Not everyone was so kind, as Craig Revel Horwood claimed Alex was "flat footed" and looked like she was "churning butter".</p>

      <p>Things got a bit awkward when Craig claimed she was "tense downstairs" - leading to some confusion with Motsi Mabuse.</p>
      <p>Praising the pair's emotional connection, head judge Shirley Ballas said: "At this late stage of the game there were some mistakes and places where you were off balance. Vote, vote, vote is all I say."</p>
      <p>Neil actually defended his partner by insisting he was at fault for making them go off balance.</p>

      <p>Bruno Tonioli was very impressed and called Alex a "scorching hot temptress".</p>
      <p>But the pair received an uninspiring score of 26 from the judges - with just a 4 from harsh Craig.</p>
