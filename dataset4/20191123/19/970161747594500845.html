      <p>The owners of a Victorian seafront hotel gutted following a huge blaze said the damage had been ‘devastating’ as fire crews remain in place amid fears over the building’s stability.</p>
      <p>Huge flames tore through Eastbourne’s Claremont Hotel yesterday after a fire broke out in the basement.</p>
      <p>The East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said they were trying to isolate the grade II-listed building’s gas supply, but ‘concerns over the stability’ mean it ‘may take some time’.</p>
      <p>Daish’s Holidays, which owns the hotel, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> back to the 1850s, issued a statement expressing their ‘heartfelt’ thanks ‘to all who have supported and are continuing to support all those affected by the devastating fire’.</p>
      <p>‘This situation has saddened us all and we greatly appreciate the dedication and positivity from all those involved in helping to contain the fire and manage public safety, as well as the understanding of all those affected,’ it added.</p>

      <p>A hotel spokesperson said all 130 guests had been evacuated and travel had been arranged for them to get home.</p>
      <p>Flames spread from the hotel’s basement, engulfing much of the building’s interior, and could be seen billowing out of the windows and roof.</p>
      <p>Sea water was pumped from the beach to be used by firefighters who had battled for five hours to get it under control.</p>

      <p>The company said it was in touch with guests to support them with lost belongings and finding alternative arrangements.</p>
      <p>It added it will also cover staff wages in the short term and look to redeploy workers in other roles ‘wherever possible’.</p>
      <p>The company further thanked locals who have so far donated more than £1,300 to a <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/claremont-fire">JustGiving</a> page set up to support employees.</p>
      <p>‘This demonstrates the level of support and compassion amongst our friends and neighbours, for which we are truly thankful,’ the statement continued.</p>
      <p>‘We are continuing to work closely with the emergency services and local authorities to support their actions over the coming hours and days and we look forward to the outcome of their investigations in due course.’</p>
