      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> hailed the hunger of his team after Liverpool maintained their eight-point gap at the top of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> with a thrilling 2-1 victory over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>Wilfried Zaha appeared to have rescued a point for the Eagles when he cancelled out <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a>’s 49th-minute opener at Selhurst Park with just eight minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>But, three minutes later, Roberto Firmino scored from a corner to ensure Liverpool left south London with three points and have now gone 30 games unbeaten in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Klopp, reacting to the win, said: ‘I’m not surprised at all that it was tough, to be honest. You probably saw all my games [against Palace], they were always similar.</p>
      <p>‘We just know it’s a tough place – the atmosphere is good, they don’t give up. Crystal Palace doesn’t need a lot of situations to stay in the game.</p>

      <p>‘We knew before that they can play really good football. They were more often direct and did that pretty well, had moments after set-pieces.</p>
      <p>‘We knew at half-time we had to do better. The challenges – I said it now to pretty much everybody and their dogs – that they [the players] come back from so many different national teams.</p>
      <p>‘So today I have absolutely no problem that we were not brilliant because in a game like this you just have to make sure that you fight for the right result.’</p>
      <p>Klopp, whose Liverpool side have dropped just two points this season, added: ‘Could we have played better? Yes.</p>

      <p>‘But we had players on the pitch that were on Thursday morning still in a plane back from Abu Dhabi, so that’s not too cool.</p>
      <p>‘Getting a result at Crystal Palace is something we never take for granted. It feels good.’</p>
      <p>Star defender Virgil van Dijk, meanwhile, described Liverpool’s win over Palace as ‘massive’.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously everyone knows how tough it is to come here against a very well organised side after the international break, and we were very happy with the three points,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘If you are prepared to suffer setbacks, because in the games that will happen, it’s about how you react and so far we have been doing that pretty well.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously we try to minimise the setbacks in the game, we tried to not concede and today they scored the goal.</p>
      <p>‘We had opportunities to score a second and it’s how you react, and so far we have been doing pretty well.’</p>
