      <h1>Stephen Curry, Will Arnett working on NBA-centric TV show collaboration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:35:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>Two of the best in their respective are teaming up in what figures to be a great collaboration that we’re looking to enjoy in the future.</p>
      <p>Comedian Will Arnett and Warriors two-time MVP Steph Curry are currently working together on a TV show which will have an NBA theme. It has an interesting premise, and Variety was able to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/stephen-curry-john-legend-signing-day-1203410951/">provide the details</a> regarding the show.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Second Half” takes a “humorous look” at a retired NBA player who moves back home to Charlotte, buys a car wash and struggles to reconnect with his father, daughter, ex-girlfriend, and childhood best friend. He starts to realize that when it comes to the game of life.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Looks like Steph is attempting to capitalize on his brand being as strong as possible — just like LeBron James — trying his hand in the TV world. He does seem to be a suitable candidate for the silver-screen world.</p>
