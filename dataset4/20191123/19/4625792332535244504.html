      <h1>‘Dammit, the mafia couldn’t kill me’: Giuliani says he won't be taken down in Ukraine saga</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:30:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Rudy Giuliani exerted confidence that he won’t face repercussions for his involvement with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>President Trump’s personal lawyer and his associates pushed Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Giuliani’s associates, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, were arrested in October on charges of illegal campaign contributions.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-being-investigated-for-possible-campaign-finance-and-lobbying-violations">are investigating</a> whether the former New York City mayor failed to register as a foreign agent and if he expected to personally profit from <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-prosecutors-investigating-giuliani-for-ties-to-ukrainian-energy-projects">a proposed pipeline project in Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>“Oh wow,” Giuliani said Saturday when asked by Fox News if he was afraid that could be indicted. “You think I’m afraid? You think I get afraid?”</p>
      <p>Giuliani then accused the media of covering up the wrongdoing he alleges Biden committed.</p>
      <p>“The reality is I’m embarrassed for you because you didn’t do your job,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The moment I heard Biden’s name, I told my colleagues they’re going to try to kill me because they’re going to kill the messenger. But dammit, the mafia couldn’t kill me. Your colleagues are not going to kill me,” Giuliani said.</p>
      <p>The lawyer denied he has any financial or business interests in Ukraine.</p>
