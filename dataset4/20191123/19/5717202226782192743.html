      <h1>Report suggests David Moyes is ‘a phone call’ away from replacing Marco Silva at Everton</h1>
      <h2>Everton lost to Norwich City this weekend, increasing pressure on boss Marco Silva.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:08:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>The pressure on Everton manager Marco Silva appears to have reached a boiling point after an insipid defeat to Norwich City in the Premier League this weekend. Everton put in yet another poor showing as the Canaries ran home 2-0 winners thanks to goals from Todd Cantwell and Dennis Srbeny. </p>
      <p>The Everton fans made their displeasure very clear after the game and it is looking increasingly likely that the Portuguese is set for the sack. </p>
      <p>If that does prove the case, it appears David Moyes could be in pole position for a return to Goodison Park. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/norwich-beat-everton-goodison-park-mouting-pressure-onto-marco/">As reported by The Telegraph, </a>the Scot is  ‘a phone call’ away from being re-appointed Everton manager, six-and-half years after ending his 11-association with the club to take over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. </p>
      <p>There has been talk of Moyes potentially taking over on a caretaker basis if Everton decide to sack Silva. Whilst many Everton fans will have fond memories of Moyes’ time at Goodison Park, others will point to his more recent managerial record with United, Real Sociedad, Sunderland and West Ham with caution. </p>
      <p>Time will tell if Silva manages to hold on to his job after this latest setback. If so, Moyes appears to be waiting by the phone.</p>
