      <p>Military leaders hoping to keep the Secretary of the Navy from quitting lobbied President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One to stop intervening <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-slams-navy-acting-against-seal-convicted-posing-isis-corpse-n1088356">in the case of a Navy SEAL accused of murder</a>, five current and one former military and defense officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/military-leaders-lobby-trump-not-meddle-seal-case-top-navy-n1089661">told NBC News</a>.</p>
      <p>On Thursday Trump waded once again into the case of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of murdering a wounded ISIS militant in Iraq in 2017. Gallagher was acquitted by a military court but found guilty of posing with the dead prisoner's body.</p>
      <p> Trump, who had previously restored Gallagher’s rank, denounced a new Navy administrative probe into whether Gallagher should remain in the elite SEAL corps. “The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” the president tweeted.</p>
