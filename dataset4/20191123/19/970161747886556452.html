      </p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/are-kendall-and-kylie-jenner-and-the-kardashians-watching-caitlyn-on-im-a-celeb-in-america-11200479/">The Kardashian clan had kept noticeably silent</a> on Caitlyn’s appearance in the jungle – until now.</p>
      <p>Kim, who was raised by Caitlyn after her mother married her in 1991, took to Twitter to share a video of the Olympic gold medalist delivering a rousing speech to her fellow celebrities.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old told her fellow campmates: ‘Let’s go team! Not just another day, another day to excel, another day to be great.</p>
      <p>‘Rise and shine,’ she added, in an apparent reference to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/kylie-jenner-cashing-viral-meme-releasing-rise-shine-merch-course-10939488/">Rise and Shine song</a> her daughter Kylie Jenner has sang to her baby Stormi.</p>

      <p>‘I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago,’ Kim said of the video, and honestly, we can’t blame her.</p>

      <p>This tweet might not seem like much, but it’s the first time that someone from the Kardashian family has spoken publically about Caitlyn being in the jungle.</p>
      <p>This includes Caitlyn’s biological daughters Kendall and Kylie, who have yet to reference her time on the show.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebritycaitlyn-jenner-kardashians-11170629/">Caitlyn’s relationship with that branch of her family</a> tree has endured some tension in the past after Caitlyn released her memoir, as it was perceived that Caitlyn was making negative comments about her ex-wife Kris and the Kardashian lifestyle.</p>
      <p>In the book, Caitlyn wrote that ‘anytime a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money’.</p>

      <p>Nowadays however, Caitlyn’s relationship with her ex Kris, her daughters and her step-children has largely improved.</p>
      <p>Her relationship with Khloe however may not yet be back on track as she was not seen at Caitlyn’s 70th birthday party in October.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn has not shied away from speaking about her family on the show and has shared details about Kim’s start in business, saying: ‘Kimberly never went to college. The minute she left high school she started businesses. She had her first business out of the closet.</p>

      <p>‘Kimberly would go into the ladies’ closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet – they’re huge. Beverly Hills ladies.</p>
      <p>‘They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberly has an eBay site… Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission.’</p>
      <p>She also praised Kim’s husband, saying: ‘I like Kanye. Kanye was very, very good to me.’</p>
