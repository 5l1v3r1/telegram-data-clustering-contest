      <h1>'My blood is boiling' - Former Birmingham City player accused of making vile slur</h1>
      <h2>The incident is alleged to have happened during Leyton Orient's match with Forest Green</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:48:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:48</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Former Birmingham City player Mark Cooper has been accused of making a vile slur concerning the late Justin Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh tragically passed away over the summer after guiding Leyton Orient back into the Football League and, after a brief spell under Carl Fletcher, Ross Embleton has taken temporary charge of the O’s.</p>
      <p>Embleton’s side were defeated 4-2 by Forest Green at Brisbane Road on Saturday and they are now languishing in 18th position in League Two.</p>

      <p>But the match was overshadowed by an incident between Embleton and Forest Green manager Cooper on the touchline. Embleton became visibly angry with something Cooper said and proceeded to throw chewing gum at the 50-year-old, who spent one season at St Andrew’s during his playing days.</p>
      <p>Cooper's son Charlie also spent time in Blues' academy before joining Forest Green in 2017.</p>
      <p>Referee Chris Sarginson sent Embleton, 38, off after the exchange and the Orient boss has now given his version of events.</p>
      <p>He alleges Cooper said ‘Who do you think you are, Justin Edinburgh?’ during a heated discussion on the touchline, which is why he reacted the way he did.</p>
      <h4>Here is Embleton's post-match interview in full:</h4>
      <p>“I got told I’m an impostor being in and around the environment that I’m in. But it’s great because I’ve spent most of my life being an impostor - I didn’t play football, didn’t have a football career.</p>
      <p>“I’ve worked extremely hard to get myself to where I am and where I have been in my coaching career. It’s a thing which has been thrown at me quite regularly and I quite like it, it’s my thing.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people don’t know my name, a lot of people don’t know who I am and I can accept that. But to follow it up with, ‘Who do I think I am, Justin Edinburgh?’ is something I’ll never accept.</p>

      <p>“I have to apologise to everybody, the fans, the players and the staff, for getting sent off. It has a negative effect on the team and it shows a lack of discipline.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, if there’s anybody out there that wants to get me sent off then use that phrase. For me, it’s totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“I knew of Mark Cooper’s behaviour at times and the way that he approaches different people but today has shown me what he’s all about.</p>

      <p>“I got sent off for throwing my chewing gum at him. Ultimately, that’s something I deserve - you can’t do that sort of thing. However, it was either that or do something a lot more aggressive. That would have been even more naive of me and I probably would spend more time in the stands than perhaps I’m going to.</p>
      <p>“It was the best way for me to deal with it at that moment in time. My blood is still boiling. I suppose the further I go with it, the more difficult I’m going to make it. Everybody is aware of exactly what happened now and it’s a case of focusing on what the game looked like and where we fell short today.”</p>
