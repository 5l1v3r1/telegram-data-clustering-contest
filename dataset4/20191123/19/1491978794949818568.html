      <h1>Enough of Gen Z’s sorry generation game. Get the boomers onside</h1>

      </p>
      <p>If you want to know what generational guilt feels like, try giving a careers talk about getting into an industry in which jobs are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/09/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-dropped-by-a-quarter-since-2008/">steadily shrinking</a>. It’s a difficult balance between providing encouragement to the next generation of journalists, whom the world will need more than ever, and being honest that there are no longer as many routes through the door as there were for my generation, let alone the one above me.</p>
      <p>So I have some sympathy for the “OK Boomer” meme that has mushroomed across the internet in recent weeks. It’s a collective facepalm from Generation Z – born after 1995 – at the raw deal on housing, the climate crisis and pensions bequeathed to them by their parents and grandparents. And it has gone viral: in the past week, #OKBoomer has racked up <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/50503681">732m uses</a> and counting; there are now thousands of <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/%22ok+boomer%22?ref=search_box">OK-boomer-emblazoned products</a> for sale and it even has its own anthem, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3mQuvU_w8">streamed by millions</a> on TikTok.</p>
      <p>Narratives about age as the new social cleavage tend to underplay the importance of class. The concept of one generation stealing another’s future is unlikely to resonate with women in their late 50s with little to no pension provision, struggling to combine caring responsibilities for their ageing parents with low-paid work. Intergenerational inequities only make who your parents are more important than ever, with growing numbers of first-time buyers relying on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/27/bank-of-mum-and-dad-housing-market-unfair-study">parental help</a>. But this doesn’t change the fact that those born in the 1980s and 90s might be the first generation in a long time to be worse off than their parents – and that’s before you take into account the catastrophic levels of global heating we are hurtling towards.</p>
      <p>The problem with #OKBoomer is it falls into a trap set by the Piers Morgans of this world, who goad young “snowflakes” for impeding their own trajectory to homeownership by indulging their taste for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/australian-millionaire-millennials-avocado-toast-house">smashed avocado</a> on toast. It plays into the hands of those who would like to see intergenerational conflict reign over cross-generational solidarity because, not to put too fine a point on it, it suits their own financial interests rather nicely.</p>
      <p>That’s not most baby boomers, though. Their collective failure to “pay it forward” is not generational malice aforethought but the result of political choices. Margaret Thatcher’s sell-off of council homes created a generation of homeowners, but a failure to build more homes and sufficiently tax housing generated huge windfall gains for them at the price of locking a younger generation out of affordable housing.</p>
      <p>The debt-fuelled economic growth that ensued from runaway house price inflation drove increases in living standards measured by people’s ability to consume ever more stuff, with the environmental cost of that dawning too late. But drop my generation or Gen Z back into the mid-70s as young adults and I’m almost certain our current predicament would be no different.</p>

      <p>What has been so disappointing is the lack of reckoning now that that predicament has become so clear. Wealthy boomers are not, collectively, making political choices that see them paying in to support the next generation. This isn’t because they are evil, but because many buy into a trope that is as intuitive as it is wrong: that their financial success has come about much more as a result of their smart choices than through zero-sum economics that has delivered them huge amounts of housing wealth and generous final-salary pensions at the expense of the young.</p>
      <p>Donning an OK Boomer sweatshirt may feel satisfying, but it gets up the noses of at least some of the people you need to get onside to create political change. It papers over some of the struggles on race, gender and sexual identity that boomers fought so our generation would not have to, and it amplifies the alt-right you’re-all-snowflakes brigade at the expense of explaining to people why they owe society a bit more than they might initially think.</p>
      <p>None of this is to blame Gen Z. They are just taking their cue from their elders. Look right or left and politics is being defined by populist blame games, whether the rank scapegoating of immigrants and welfare recipients or attacks on billionaires and bankers. Of course, the latter are infinitely better than the former. But I am sceptical that the politics of resentment will create the social change that we on the left all want to see.</p>
      <p>A problem with the “for the many, not the few” framing adopted by Labour is that it pretty much writes off winning round the hostile “few”; they are implicitly the enemy. The vast majority of us can enjoy a better world, funded by higher taxes on the 5%. I support those taxes, but I think plenty in the 95% might doubt that the costs can be limited to the 5%. Take housing: to improve affordability, we need politicians brave enough to make the case for falling house prices that will affect far more than the top 5%. And some of the 95% may worry that one day they might fall into that 5%. So to win over enough of the 95% – and hopefully some of the 5% too – you have to construct a winning argument, articulated over and over, about why the 5% should be paying in more. But implicit in “them v us” is the supposition that you really should not need an explanation for why immoral freeloaders must be forced to pay more.</p>
      <p>The best way to achieve progressive change is to create broad coalitions of support that build solidarity between people with different values. The left’s successes in winning round conservative voters to equal marriage in the US or abortion reform in Ireland did not come as a result of hectoring them as to why they were wrong, but of pragmatically framing arguments that chimed with people who came from an altogether different starting point. The fact that OK Boomer has taken off so spectacularly should prompt some introspection about the example Generation Z are being set by the rest of us.</p>
