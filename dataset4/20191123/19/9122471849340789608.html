      <h1>Injury Update For Penn State QB Sean Clifford</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:17:14+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Penn State Nittany Lions took the field for a Big Ten battle with arguably the best team in the country: Ohio State.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes opened as a 18-point favorite, but that line eventually slipped to 19.5 just before kickoff.</p>
      <p>The first half showed why Ohio State was such a heavy favorite. Quarterback Justin Fields and running back J.K. Dobbins ran wild against Penn State’s top-10 rush defense.</p>
      <p>Ohio State eventually opened a 21-0 lead on a beautiful touchdown pass from Fields.</p>
      <p>Then things got worse for Penn State.</p>
      <p>Star quarterback Sean Clifford left the game with an apparent leg injury. It’s unclear if Clifford injured his hip or his leg on the play.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>Clifford appears to fall awkwardly on his right leg.</p>
      <p>He remained on the ground for several minutes, where trainers came out to look at him. The Nittany Lions quarterback eventually walked off under his own power and hopped on the stationary bike to work out his leg.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback Will Levis entered the game and led the Nittany Lions to a touchdown. Running back Journey Brown found the endzone to give Penn State its first points of the game.</p>
      <p>Ohio State leads 21-7.</p>
