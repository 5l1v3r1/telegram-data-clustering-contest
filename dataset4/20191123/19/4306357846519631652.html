      <h3>Gary Lineker took to social media to reveal his delight at how entertaining Manchester City’s 2-1 win over Chelsea FC in the Premier League on Saturday evening was.</h3>
      <p>Chelsea FC headed into the game looking to make it seven wins in the Premier League in a row after their recent fine form under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>The Blues took the lead in the 21st minute when N’Golo Kante bundled his shot home.</p>
      <p>However, Manchester City were level shortly after when Kevin De Bruyne’s shot found the net thanks to a hefty deflection.</p>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez then made it 2-1 to Pep Guardiola’s hosts in the 37th minute with a fine finish into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>In stoppage time, Raheem Sterling had a goal chalked off by VAR after he was adjudged to be offside.</p>
      <p>England legend Lineker was clearly enjoying what he was seeing as the game at The Etihad proved to be an entertaining affair.</p>
      <p>After Chelsea FC’s opener, Lineker <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198298373448704001">tweeted</a>: “Terrific goal from @nglkante. Chelsea have been good thus far. Really good.”</p>
      <p>He then <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198300326551576578">added</a> after De Bruyne’s equaliser: “Cracking game and @ManCity level things, albeit a tad fortuitously.”</p>
      <p>And after Mahrez put the home side ahead, he <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198302238080425984">wrote</a>: “Outstanding goal from @Mahrez22. So much quality out there that anything could happen at any moment.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action next weekend with a home clash against London rivals West Ham United on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Before that, they will take on Valencia in the Champions League at home on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Manchester City, meanwhile, will take on Newcastle United away from home next weekend.</p>
