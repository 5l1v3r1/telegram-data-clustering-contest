      <p>Volkswagen finished eleventh ahead of Nissan, Datsun, sister brand Skoda and FCA in October 2019. The company will have a big presence at the 2020 Auto Expo as the forthcoming mid-size SUV based on the MQB A0 IN platform will be showcased in concept or near-production form.</p>
      <p>As part of making a strong impact in the domestic market, Volkswagen and Skoda have merged into a single entity as they have embarked on India 2.0 project with more than one billion euros investment. This mainly deals with localising the upcoming products to allow them have competitive price ranges.</p>

      <p>Volkswagen’s mid-size SUV will draw design cues from the T-Cross while the Kamiq will act as a base for Skoda’s version. Both will enter the market sometime in 2021 while the replacements of the Vento and Rapid also appear to be on the cards in the near future. VW will be pitched as an SUV centric automaker in the coming years capitalising on its premium brand image.</p>
