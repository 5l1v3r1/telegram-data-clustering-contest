        <b>After helping Wales reach Euro 2020 in midweek, Gareth Bale has been named as a substitute for Real Madrid on Saturday</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gareth Bale could make his first LaLiga appearance since October 5 after he was named on a star-studded Real Madrid bench for the home game against Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>Forward Bale has not featured for his club since the 4-2 win over Granada at the start of last month, though he has played four times for Wales since that outing.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old was on international duty during the week, helping Ryan Giggs’ squad secure a place at Euro 2020 with a 2-0 win over Hungary. He celebrated after the final whistle, dancing and singing with a banner that read:  ‘WALES. GOLF. MADRID…IN THAT ORDER’</p>
      <p>The slogan originates from a chant by Wales supporters that pokes fun at perceptions of Bale among the Spanish media, who have accused the former Tottenham player of pushing Madrid down his list of priorities.</p>
      <p>Prior to Saturday’s game with Sociedad, Zinedine Zidane called for the Madrid fans to get behind Bale, who almost moved to China earlier in the year.</p>

      <p>Bale will wait to find out if the Santiago Bernabeu faithful take their head coach’s advice, depending on whether he is involved during proceedings in the capital.</p>
      <p>Toni Kroos, Marcelo and Isco are also substitutes for Madrid, with the only change from the XI that started the 4-0 win over Eibar seeing Rodrygo Goes replace the injured Lucas Vazquez.</p>
