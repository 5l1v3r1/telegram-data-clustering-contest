      <h1>Jurgen Klopp: 'Liverpool not trying to show we invented football'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> has insisted that he is not concerned about breaking records after watching his side make it 30 Premier League games without defeat by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park</a> this afternoon.</h2>

      <p>Only two teams in the competition's history have ever enjoyed longer undefeated streaks, while 20 of Liverpool's last 21 top-flight outings have seen them take all three points.</p>
      <p>The Reds' latest victory ensures that they remain eight points clear at the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">top of the table</a>, but Klopp insists that he is solely focused on the upcoming games rather than his side's place in history.</p>
      <p>"We are not out there to show we invented football because we didn't, we have a job to do. We have to get results for our colours and that's what we did again. Now we play Napoli, then Brighton is coming and then we have the derby so tough games to come. We still create the basis for us - that's still what we are doing and hopefully we can continue with it," he told reporters at his post-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"We really need a result next week against Brighton but before that we have to play against Napoli and then we will see. We really are not out there to break records, we are out there to get the best result over the full season.</p>
      <p>"If on that way we break one or two records good - we take that of course - but winning the next game is much more important than people in 10 or 15 years saying that is the record set by this team. We really have a bigger job to do. If one depends on the other then we'll take both."</p>
      <p>Should Liverpool avoid defeat against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion next weekend then they would equal the club record for their longest ever top-flight unbeaten run.</p>
