      <p>(Reuters) - Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel have cleared the air after a Brazilian Grand Prix collision that put both of them out of the penultimate race of the Formula One season, the team said.</p>
      <p>Team boss Mattia Binotto said after the race at Interlagos that there would be a review with the drivers at the Maranello factory to go through what went on and how to prevent any recurrence.</p>
      <p>“Since last Sunday Mattia and the drivers have spoken every day, as they would normally do anyway, so there was no official summit nor video conference,” a Ferrari spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>“Air is now fully cleared and we are focusing on Abu Dhabi.”</p>
      <p>The collision between the young charger and a four times world champion, who have been battling for supremacy this season, provided a major talking point at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>“They know that silly mistakes are still silly mistakes. What happened today is a shame for the team,” Binotto said at the time.</p>
      <p>The final race of the season at Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina is next week, with both championships already won by Mercedes for an unprecedented sixth season in succession.</p>
      <p>Britain’s Lewis Hamilton wrapped up his sixth title in Texas this month.</p>
      <p>Ferrari are sure of second place in the constructors’ championship.</p>
