      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:07:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:07</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Kilmarnock boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Angelo Alessio</a> praised his side's 'perfect' start as they came firing out of the traps to stun struggling Hearts.</p>
      <p>The Rugby Park side hit three goals in a wild opening 16-minute spell that was inspired by winger Chris Burke.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old contributed two goals and an assist as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Killie</a> moved within three points of third-placed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> with a 3-0 victory.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's difficult to start like that every week but today is perfect because we scored three goals in 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>"Every game in this league is tough but I think the players entered the pitch very well, with a good approach and attitude.</p>
      <p>"We deserved to score three goals because we created a lot of chances in 30 minutes and we deserved to win.</p>
      <p>"Two months ago our difficulty was scoring goals and now we score three goals early on. We are happy but we need to continue to improve.</p>

      <p>"I'm pleased but I've asked the players to recover in the right way as we have lots of games coming up.</p>
      <p>"We have <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> , Celtic and St Mirren away so it was important to win this game today and try and get as many points as possible from those games."</p>
      <p>Burke fired the hosts ahead after nine minutes after he was released by an excellent pass by Mohamed El Makrini.</p>
      <p>The outstanding Burke went from scorer to provider in the 13th minute when he produced a stunning cross for Eamonn Brophy to power a header home.</p>
      <p>The experienced Burke then added his second after a devastating counter-attack.</p>
