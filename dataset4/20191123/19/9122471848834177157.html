      <h1>Penn State Fans Wondering If Sean Clifford Has Lost Starting Job To Will Levis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:52:14+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Penn State has scored 17 unanswered points against Ohio State, and many Nittany Lions fans are wondering if quarterback play is the main reason why. Will Levis, in for an injured Sean Clifford, has led his teams to scores on three consecutive drives.</p>
      <p>Clifford <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/penn-state-nittany-lions/injury-update-for-penn-state-qb-sean-clifford">went down and appeared to injure his leg</a> in the third quarter with the score 21-0 Ohio State. He headed to the medical tent and hasn’t returned to action.</p>
      <p>Levis has been a problem for Ohio State. He’s only thrown a few passes, but he’s been able to keep the chains moving with his legs. He’s rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown thus far.</p>
      <p>Levis is a 6-foot-3, 230-pound redshirt freshman. He was a <a href="https://247sports.com/Player/Will-Levis-92779/">composite three-star player</a> for the class of 2018.</p>
      <p>At the moment, it’s unclear if Clifford is too injured to play – or if Penn State head coach James Franklin is making the decision to keep Levis in the game. It’s currently 21-17 and Levis has looked like the better option.</p>
      <p>Many are wondering if Clifford has lost his job:</p>
