      <p>Stephen Mulhern has warned Ant and Dec: "I'll smash your faces in".</p>
      <p>The comments from Stephen, who is also a present on ITV, came after the cheeky Geordie duo made a swipe at him on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>Ant McPartlin has returned to TV to present I'm A Celeb alongside Declan Donnelly, after Holly Willoughby replaced him last year while he dealt with personal issues.</p>
      <p>However, the pair's 'cruel' joke on I'm A Celebrity has left Stephen incensed - and he issued a brutal response to the pair's brazen cheekiness.</p>

      <p>The cheeky presenters joked that Stephen should front a 'cheap, one dimensional and very low rent show' based on a game invented in the jungle by the I'm A Celebrity campmates.</p>
      <p>Dec joked: "Don’t miss Stephen Mulhern’s Quick Draw next Saturday only on ITV."</p>
      <p>Ant added: "He’ll present anything."</p>
      <p>And turning to face the camera, Dec said: "Hi Stevie."</p>
      <p>The duo tweeted to ask if Stephen was watching and he replied drily: "Didn’t see the show, as was too busy filming the Xmas special of In for A Penny, making more money for you two millionaires #happychristmas. Mention me again and I’ll smash your faces in."</p>
      <p>Fans found the exchange hilarious, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/stephen-mulhern-warns-ant-dec-17300659">Manchester Evening News</a> .</p>
      <p>"You two are a cruel pair," tweeted one with a crying-with-laughter emoji.</p>
      <p>"And the funny thing is, he’s busy because of them," laughed another.</p>
