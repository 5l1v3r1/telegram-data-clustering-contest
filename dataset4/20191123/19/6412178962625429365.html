        <b>Manchester City have moved above Chelsea and into 3rd after a Riyad Mahrez stunner was enough to give them a narrow win over Frank Lampard’s side.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea made the stronger start of the two and took the lead after 20 minutes courtesy of N’Golo Kante after Mateo Kovacic set him up with a stunning pass.</p>
      <p>This sparked Man City into life, and they levelled things up less than 10 minutes later after Kevin de Bruyne’s shot deflected off Kurt Zouma and into the net. They then took the lead in the 36th minute thanks to Riyad Mahrez, who fired in after a glorious run through the Chelsea defence.</p>
      <p>Mahrez almost scored his second at the start of the second-half when he hit a shot inches wide before Kante also came close to his. City, keen on scoring a third, continued to create more chances but struggled to make the most of them.</p>
      <p>Willian stung the hands of Ederson with ten minutes to go but Guardiola’s men held firm and almost scored a third, with Sterling’s 93rd-minute effort ruled out by VAR. It wouldn’t matter though, as they took their fifth consecutive home win of the season.</p>
      <p>The match was an entertaining one with both sides keen to attack. City had a good early chance when Aguero played in De Bruyne but the Belgian drove his shot across goal.</p>
      <p>Chelsea also went close after Tammy Abraham broke clear from a poor Mahrez pass and teed up Willian but the Brazilian fired past the far post.</p>
      <p>The visitors enjoyed a spell in the ascendancy and Abraham curled a shot over from Fikayo Tomori which also missed the target.</p>
      <p>The visitors were rewarded for their positivity when they claimed the lead after 21 minutes. Mateo Kovacic picked out Kante with a well-weighted ball over the top and the Frenchman took a touch before poking a shot under the advancing Ederson.</p>
      <p>That prompted a strong response from the hosts and they were level within eight minutes as De Bruyne struck from the edge of the area, albeit with a slice of luck.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne wrongfooted two defenders with a nice touch but was then fortunate as his shot took two deflections to deceive Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne had a repeat opportunity moments later only to fire over but Mahrez stepped up to put City ahead with a fine individual goal.</p>
      <p>The Algeria international cut inside from the left between two defenders and sent a low shot through the legs of Tomori and into the far corner of the net.</p>
      <p>It might have got worse for Chelsea as Kepa gifted another chance to Aguero in front of goal but the Argentinian thumped his shot against the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Mahrez went close to grabbing a second after the break following another run across the box but this time he clipped his effort wide.</p>
      <p>Mahrez was unlucky again after Cesar Azpilicueta produced a fine block to deny Fernandinho and the ball dropped to him, but this time Kepa touched his powerful drive over.</p>
      <p>Phil Foden looked lively after he was introduced for David Silva – who was suffering from cramp – in the 67th minute but his first effort saw him shoot tamely at Kepa.</p>
      <p>Aguero wanted a penalty after tangling with Reece James on the edge of the area but nothing was given.</p>
      <p>Aguero may have been hurt in that fall as it proved to be his last meaningful involvement and he limped off soon after.</p>
      <p>For all City’s control in the second half, they did not kill off the game and they had scares when Willian volleyed over and Mason Mount curled an injury-time free-kick wide.</p>
      <p>There was drama in the closing moments as Sterling struck but VAR denied him by millimetres.</p>
