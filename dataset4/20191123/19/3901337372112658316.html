      <p>Golden Arrows head coach Steve Komphela has explained where his charges went wrong against Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p><b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/mamelodi-sundowns/telkom-knockout-semi-final-report-golden-arrows-v-mamelodi-sundowns-23-november-2019/668039">Mixed Day For Sirino As Downs Secure TKO Final Spot</a></b>R</p>
      <p>Arrows were dumped out of the Telkom Knockout following a 2-1 loss to Sundowns at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium.</p>
      <p>Komphela felt playing the ball in the air went against his charges on the day.</p>
      <p>"So close, so near yet so far. I thought it was classic example of we didn't have time, if we had more [time towards the end] maybe something could have happened but I thought we had a better second-half," the former Komphela told SuperSport after the match.</p>
      <p>"We played much better, we were more calm, more composed, it was a Golden Arrows that we know. I thought first-half we were too anxious, too many errors, we lacked the composure to defend a free-kick," he went on.</p>
      <p>"Then the second goal, which classifies or characterises [the first-half performance], we were all over the box, we should have done better but second-half was much better, we enjoyed the ball, we played well, we kept the ball on the ground.</p>
      <p>"The only thing we did badly was when we played the ball in the air where it got lost, so you can't play the ball in the air, the amount of time you take when penetrating on the ground is faster than when you launch because when you launch it's 50/50 and we failed to recognise that."</p>
