      <p>Madrid -<b>Â </b>Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil led <b>Canada</b> to their maiden <b>Davis Cup</b> final with victory in a deciding doubles rubber against <b>Russia </b>in Madrid on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Shapovalov had drawn Canada level by beating Karen Khachanov after Andrey Rublev's win over Pospisil in the opening match.</p>
      <p>The Canadian pair then edged out Khachanov and Rublev in a dramatic deciding-set tie-break to set up a final clash against either Britain or hosts Spain on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I thought both teams played phenomenal," Canada captain Frank Dancevic said.</p>
      <p>"The Russians threw everything they had at us, it was just a matter of who came up with the better shots. There was no room for error today - they went for their shots, went big in the big moments, and here we are into the final."</p>
      <p>It was their third Davis Cup semi-final, after previous last-four defeats in 1913 and 2013.</p>
      <p>"We've got a huge day, a historic day for us tomorrow, and we're going to leave it all out there," said world number 150 Pospisil.</p>
      <p>They secured a 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory on their second match point to finish a tie which lasted six and a half hours.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Shapovalov had seen off Khachanov, Russia's leading player in the absence of world number four Daniil Medvedev due to exhaustion, in a dramatic match.</p>
      <p>The left-handed rising star, who reached his maiden Masters final in Paris earlier this month, saved three successive break points while serving for the match.</p>
      <p>The in-form Rublev had made it four singles wins from as many matches this week by brushing aside Pospisil 6-4, 6-4.</p>
      <p>Canada have reached the final despite being without the injured Felix Auger-Aliassime, the world number 22, with Pospisil stepping up instead.</p>
      <p>"I'm at a loss for words," Shapovalov said. "It's incredible how far we've come this week, with me and Vasek playing on a different level.</p>
      <p>"It's unbelievable to see. And to clinch it like this, in the doubles, I wouldn't have it any other way."</p>
      <p>Later on Saturday, Rafael Nadal's Spain take on Britain in the second semi-final.</p>
      <p>British captain Leon Smith again decided to leave out three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray, instead selecting Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans for the two singles matches.</p>
      <p>Edmund will face Pablo Carreno Busta before Evans takes on world number one Nadal and Jamie Murray teams up with Neal Skupski to play Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez.</p>
