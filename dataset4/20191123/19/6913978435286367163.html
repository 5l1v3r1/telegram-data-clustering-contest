      <p><b>MANAMA</b> — Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir cautioned on Saturday against appeasement of Iran, saying sectarian goals cannot be allowed to continue to define Tehran’s foreign policy.<br/><br/>Al-Jubeir while addressing the annual Manama Dialogue in Bahrain painted the region as facing a choice between good and evil after the Sep.14 attacks on Saudi Aramco’s oil facilities.<br/><br/>The Kingdom is not against dialogue with Tehran but deterrence needs to be pursued to prevent Iran from repeating the attacks, he said.<br/><br/>“Appeasement did not work with Hitler. It will not work with the Iranian regime,” Al-Jubeir said.<br/><br/>He said the international community must “extract a price from Iran” for the Sep.14 attacks, which he said “absolutely clearly” were orchestrated with Iranian weapons and “came from the north and not south”.<br/><br/>“The Iranians cannot be allowed to get away with this,” Al-Jubeir said, adding that Saudi Arabia is waiting for the results of an international investigation into the attacks.<br/><br/>Sectarianism spread by Iran is also destructive, Al-Jubeir said, adding that Iran is de facto claiming that every Shiite belongs to Iran, which he termed as “ridiculous”.<br/><br/>“It is like Italy saying every Catholic belongs to Italy. Would Germany accept?” he said. "What we are seeing in region is a vision of light and vision of darkness.”<br/><br/>Speaking at the same event, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash called for a region-wide response to the protests across the Middle East by developing “a positive vision” that preserves stability.<br/><br/>“Along with diplomacy we need a positive vision of stability in the wider region as we see many young people take to the streets in Iran Iraq to Lebanon,” Gargash said.<br/><br/>France's armed forces minister, speaking at the same conference, warned against the dangers of US disengagement in the Middle East.<br/><br/>Florence Parly said while the Arabian Gulf is "accustomed to the ebb and flow of US involvement," America has not pushed back against Tehran after a summer of tensions sparked by President Donald Trump withdrawing unilaterally from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers.<br/><br/>She said: "When the mining of ships went unanswered, a drone got shot (down). When that in turn got unanswered, major oil facilities were bombed. Where does it stop?" —SG</p>
