      <h2>The defender needed to be substituted in the defeat to Liverpool</h2>

      <p>Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward's injury will be assessed on Monday after he picked up a knock in the defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Eagles regular was replaced in the second half by Martin Kelly after initially attempting to carry on after clashing knees.</p>
      <p>Roy Hodgson has admitted he is worried about the injury given Palace's lack of depth in the area after selling Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Palace boss said: "Yes I'm worried because it was a knee to knee clash near the touchline but I can't enlighten you for obvious reasons. He will need to be assessed and that probably won't take place until Monday now. He will have a total examination of the knee injury that he has got then and we will find the extent of it.</p>
      <p>"If it's going to be an injury that takes a period of time it's one we can ill afford because as everybody here knows that is an area of the squad where we don't have as much back up as we do in the midfield area.</p>
      <p>"Today we weren't planning to replace Joel Ward, we were planning on giving James McCarthy his chance to come on alongside Schlupp and replace our two unbelievably hardworking midfield players to the side of Luka but that had to be cancelled when Joel went down and Martin had to deputise for him."</p>
