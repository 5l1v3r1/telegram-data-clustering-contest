      <p>Also charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme is Ejiroghene Eghagha, the airline’s chief of administration and finance.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the allegations Onyema said he has never conducted business with any illegalities and he was willing to defend his innocence in the United States court.</p>
      <p>Onyema said: <i>“Thank you for reaching out to me. I can confirm to you that all allegations are false and are in no way in line with my character as a person and as a businessman whose only aim has been to build Nigeria and improve wellbeing.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I never laundered money in my life, neither have I committed bank fraud anywhere in the world. Every Kobo I transferred to the US for aircraft purchase went through the Central Bank of Nigeria LC regime and all were used for the same purpose."</i>
