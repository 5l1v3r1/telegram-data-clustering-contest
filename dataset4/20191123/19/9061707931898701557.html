      <h1>Couple shed more than eight stone after eating tons of takeaways piled on the pounds</h1>
      <h2>The cob van lady used to know their daily order as they went so often</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rhea Turner</a></address>
      <p>Bingeing on takeaways and a daily visit to the cob van led to a husband and wife piling on the pounds.</p>
      <p>But now the couple are in seventh heaven after ditching fast food and shedding an impressive eight stones between them.</p>
      <p>Dawn and Mark Smith weighed in at almost 50 stone between them but ditching the junk food has certainly paid dividends.</p>
      <p>Dawn, 29, from Ashby, has told how she was always overweight but she became tired of seeing her 'Winnie the Pooh' belly. She used to tip the scales at 20 stone, she said.</p>
      <p>While husband Mark weighed in at almost 30 stone and the pair decided it was time to change and they went on a diet together.</p>
      <p>Dawn, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/family">who is mum to Cynthia</a>, seven, and Isabelle, five, said: "I was always the fat kid at school. I have always been active and on the go but I just ate the wrong foods.</p>
      <p>"McDonald's and Chinese food are my favourites and I was always popping into Greggs on the playgroup run."</p>

      <p>Dawn said her mum used to poke fun at her 'Winnie the Pooh belly' and she became embarrassed when the woman who runs the 'cob van' knew her order every day.</p>
      <p>The mum said: "Shortbread is my real downfall but we would also snack on chocolate and crisps, sitting on the settee binging on them every night.</p>
      <p>"We would eat takeaways every night and between Mark and myself could get through at least half a loaf of bread at breakfast - just the two of us.</p>
      <p>"It was getting ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"In fact, it was so bad that the cob van lady always knew my order.</p>
      <p>"I was living in leggings and T-shirts. It was just getting embarrassing.</p>
      <p>Mark, 37, weighed in at almost 30 stone, and had diabetes and other health issues.</p>
      <p>Said Dawn: "We just sat down and talked about our weight. We needed to be around for our girls."</p>

      <p>After being inspired by Dawn’s <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/slimming-world-diet-transformation-3190488">mum’s incredible 10-stone weight loss, </a>the couple joined her at the Woodville Slimming World group in January 2019 and saw results straight away.</p>
      <p>Dawn said: "I had tried Slimming World before and it worked but I stopped going and piled the weight back on again.</p>
      <p>"I told myself that I will stick this out and I am not going to give in like I normally do.</p>
      <p>"Luckily I saw results straight away. In the first week I lost 9lbs and my clothes started feeling looser.</p>
      <p>"I felt good and it really spurred me on.</p>
      <p>"We used to be so negative and we were our own worst enemies because we had no motivation.</p>
      <p>"Now we are so proud of each other."</p>
      <p>Since joining the group <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/colin-wheeldon-slimming-world-success-3211143">Dawn, who was a size 26 to 28 and tipped the scales </a>at 20 stone and half a pound, and dropped five dress sizes and weighed around 16 stone 7.5lb.</p>
      <p>An incredible transformation in 33 weeks.</p>

      <p>The pair’s weight loss has shocked lots of people, and many have commented on Dawn’s new figure.</p>
      <p>She said: "My friends and family are all <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/cancer-a-level-burton-education-3214037">surprised at the difference in me but really proud</a>.</p>
      <p>"I cannot believe how much of a reaction I have been getting since losing the weight.</p>
      <p>"I have had strangers coming up to me in the street saying 'I have seen you around and I can’t believe you have lost so much weight. You look great'.</p>
      <p>"I am so proud of Mark, and the girls are always excited to see if we have bought any certificates back.</p>
      <p>"It just shows that if I can do it, I believe anyone can.</p>

      <p>"I used to have anxiety and panic attacks but now I sit up in the group and I give out advice.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/foremark-reservoir-save-boys-life-3263816">I won woman of the year 2019 and together we won </a>Slimming World couple of the year for 2019.</p>
      <p>"I feel so much better, so much healthier since losing weight."</p>
      <p>The couple, who run their own company, MD Smiths LTD (Electrical Contractors), are already making big plans for the future.</p>
      <p>Dawn said: "The only time I have gained weight in 33 weeks is when I went on holiday to Greece.</p>
      <p>"I am tall so I want to lose another three stone and<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/colin-wheeldon-slimming-world-success-3211143"> Mark wants to lose a total of 10 stone this year.</a></p>
      <p>"I am going to be 30 in March and I really want to have a big party and wear a nice dress and impress.</p>
      <p>"I want people to say 'oh my god' and be shocked at how I look. I can’t wait."</p>
