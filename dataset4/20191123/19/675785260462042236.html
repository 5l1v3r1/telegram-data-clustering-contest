      <p>Celebrity chefs are charging a packet to stuff diners with festive treats that will certainly eat into their wallet.</p>
      <p>Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck has the biggest bill at £375 a head… and it may not include turkey.</p>
      <p>The Fable Tree menu – an “edible adventure” exploring the role of the Christmas fir – is shrouded in secrecy.</p>
      <p>Diners heading to Bray, Berks, will be greeted by an advent calendar-style menu with seven windows which guide them through their meal.</p>
      <p>But what do they get? A staff member said: “We don’t want to ruin the surprise.”</p>
      <p>Heston himself teased: “I love the sights, sounds and smells of the festive period, but I can’t stand the traditional <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">Christmas dinner</a> .”</p>

      <p>There are fewer surprises at Gordon Ramsay’s place but the fayre is equally mouthwatering and the fee equally eye-watering – £195 for a Christmas meal and £350 for the New Year’s Eve special.</p>
      <p>Visitors to his Royal Hospital Road restaurant in Chelsea, West London, can choose from a Hogmanay menu including scallops and Cornish turbot.</p>

      <p>TV’s Tom Kerridge wants £145 for a traditional Christmas Day lunch at The Bull &amp; Bear in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Michel Roux’s Landau restaurant at the Langham Hotel in central London is £125 for a Christmas blowout – rising to £175 with wine.</p>
      <p>There are cheaper options. Weekend diners at James Martin’s Manchester restaurant get a three-course Christmas meal for £45.</p>
      <p>Marco Pierre White’s English Chophouse in London’s Whitechapel has three courses at £39.50 while Rick Stein’s restaurants in Winchester, Marlborough and Sandbanks are charging £37.50.</p>
