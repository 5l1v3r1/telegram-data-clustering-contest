      <p>PADUCAH, Ky. - Authorities say an explosion at the Dippin’ Dots production facility in Kentucky has injured four people.</p>
      <p>Dippin’ Dots CEO Scott Fischer says the explosion occurred in a production area around 10 p.m. Friday evening. Fischer said in a release that it would be premature to comment on the cause of the blast.</p>
      <p>“At this moment what is most important to us is our employees, especially our four team members who were injured last night,” Fischer said.</p>
      <p>Paducah city spokeswoman Pam Spencer said the plant had a nitrogen leak, but it was unclear whether that leak caused the explosion or happened afterward. Nitrogen is used to flash-freeze Dippin’ Dots novelty ice cream.</p>
      <p>All four people injured were hospitalized. WPSD-TV reported that one of the injured workers was released from the hospital early Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>At one point employees were not being allowed inside the building after the incident because the oxygen level was too low, the power was shut off and smoke remained inside</p>
      <p>Along with firefighters, personnel from Atmos Energy, Jackson Purchase Energy Corporation and Paducah Water were at the scene. Dippin’ Dots is headquartered in Paducah, a western Kentucky city near the Illinois state line.</p>
