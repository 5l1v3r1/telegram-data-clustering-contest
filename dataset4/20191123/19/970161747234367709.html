      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pep-guardiola/">Pep Guardiola</a> has provided a worrying injury update on Sergio Aguero after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> victory over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>.</p>
      <p>Defending champions City came from behind to beat Frank Lampard’s Chelsea 2-1 at the Etihad on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>N’Golo Kante gave Chelsea the lead after 21 minutes but Kevin De Bruyne levelled for the hosts eight minutes later.</p>
      <p>Shortly before half-time, Riyad Mahrez cut in the from the right wing and slotted a fine strike past Blues goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>
      <p>Despite the win, Manchester City fans were left concerned after star striker Aguero hobbled off in the second-half and Guardiola admitted it could be a ‘bad’ injury.</p>
      <p>‘I think Sergio will be bad,’ Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>‘We will see tomorrow. But it is what it is. We have young players who can come in.’</p>
