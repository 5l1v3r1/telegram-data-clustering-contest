      <p>This Is Us star Justin Hartley has filed for divorce from his wife, Chrishell Hartley, after two years of marriage.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old officially filed the paperwork on Friday in Los Angeles, with the reason cited as ‘irreconcilable differences’ and ‘dissolution without minor children’, according to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-hartley-files-for-divorce-from-wife-chrishell-hartley/">Us Weekly.</a></p>
      <p>Although Justin has listed their split as 8 July, the two have been seen together on a number of occasions, and more recently at a pre-Golden Globes party just last week.</p>
      <p>The actor also took the time out to wish his now ex-wife well on her birthday at the end of July.</p>
      <p>‘Let’s all wish this young gem of a human a very happy birthday!’ he wrote on Instagram.</p>
      <p>‘To many more years of love and laughs!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY @chrishellhartley!!!!!!!!’</p>
      <p>Justin and Chrishell had begun dating in January 2014, with Justin proposing to his future wife in July 2016, before the two wed the following year in October 2017.</p>

      <p>Chrishell had previously opened up about holding off on expanding her family with Justin and having another child.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t know [when] yet,’ she told <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/justin-chrishell-hartley-are-not-rushing-to-have-kids-together/">Us Weekly</a> back in May. ‘I have a stepdaughter (Justin has a daughter), so we’ve got our hands full with high school.’</p>
      <p>She also joked that Justin was nothing like his This Is Us character, Kevin Pearson: ‘Thank God because he wouldn’t be a very good husband.</p>
      <p>‘There’s parts of Kevin that are good, but I don’t think I’d want to be married to him, you know?</p>
      <p>‘So luckily, Kevin gets all of his charm, but I get both. I also get the good husband’s side. So I win!’</p>
