      <h1>Texas Announces 2 Key Players Won’t Play vs. Baylor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:29:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Despite a 6-4 record which includes three losses in Big 12 play, the Texas Longhorns still have a shot to make the conference title game. First things first, the Longhorns must beat No. 13 Baylor on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That’ll be difficult to do as a recent report suggest two key Texas players will not play against the Bears. The Longhorns will be without WR Collin Johnson and DB D.J. Foster. Johnson continues to deal with a hamstring injury while Foster is dealing with a neck injury.</p>

      <p>This is a huge loss for a Texas team hoping to upset the Bears today. Both players are high impact players for the Longhorns.</p>
      <p>Johnson has missed several games already due to a lingering hamstring injury. This will be his second-straight missed game as he also missed the Longhorns’ contest against Iowa State last week. Texas struggled to move the ball without him en route to a 23-21 defeat.</p>
      <p>This will be Johnson’s fifth missed game this season. In just six games, the lengthy receiver has 35 receptions for 497 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>As for Foster, the defensive back’s injury popped up late this week during practice. Foster has also missed several games as this will be the fourth game he’s been unable to play. In seven games this season, the defensive back has 31 tackles and one interception.</p>
      <p>Texas will have to respond to some adversity against the Baylor Bears on Saturday.</p>
