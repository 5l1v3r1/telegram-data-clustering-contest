      <h1>Guardiola Issues Defiant Man City Battle Cry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:52:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has issued a defiant message to runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool, saying his Manchester City side are not going to give up despite the yawning points gap.</p>
      <p>The City boss acknowledges that his team have it all to do, in fourth place and trailing the leaders by nine points after just 12 games.</p>
      <p>But they were 10 points adrift of Jurgen Klopp’s team in late December last year before pipping the Reds to the title on the final day by a single point.</p>
      <p>“People and the pundits say ‘it’s gone, it’s over,” he said. “Why should I think it’s over? Until May, we are the champions and we want to defend it.</p>
      <p>“We have more pressure. They can lose one or two and I prefer their position.</p>
      <p>“Three teams have more chance to win the Premier League than us but we are in November and we’ll see how we behave.”</p>
      <p>City welcome Chelsea to the Etihad on Saturday, with Frank Lampard’s team one place above them in the table, level on points with second-placed Leicester, but eight adrift of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>So before they can even think about narrowing the gap to Liverpool, City must get past Chelsea, who have won six league matches on the spin.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has taken comfort from the way City played despite losing 3-1 at Anfield a fortnight ago and believes they can turn their fortunes around.</p>
      <p>“We are nine points behind because one team won all the games except one,” he said. “The second reason is that we had some games that can happen after back-to-back (titles).</p>
      <p>“If we hadn’t made back-to-back, it would not happen. But the football we have is still there.</p>
      <p>“We have two options — give up or don’t give up. I think the way we played at Anfield, we are not going to give up.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola has cut a frustrated figure in the early months of the season and that showed in his reactions and sarcastic comments towards the match officials during the game at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>There has been speculation that he is unhappy, while his agent issued a statement insisting that Guardiola was not interested in a return to Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The man himself said such talk was wide of the mark.</p>
      <p>“If the people ask, ‘do I want to stay? I want to stay,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have any reasons to move from here. I am incredibly satisfied to work with this club and with these players.</p>
      <p>“If the people think I am going to resign or be sacked for these results and being nine points behind, then people don’t know me.</p>
      <p>“I like this challenge. I love to be in this position.</p>
      <p>“If the club wants me next season, I want to be here 100 percent. I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and I want to live and work with them.”</p>
