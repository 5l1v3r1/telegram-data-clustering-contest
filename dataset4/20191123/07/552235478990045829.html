      <h1>Amazing online iPhone 11 deal gives you 100GB of data for £40 a month with NO upfront cost</h1>
      <h2>Black Friday is bringing out the best prices for the latest handsets with huge data bundles and this is one of the best we’ve spotted so far</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:35:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:35</time> by <a rel="author">Linda Howard</a></address>
      <p>The countdown to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is turning out to be even better than the upcoming day itself as retailers across the land slash their prices in an effort to catch the attention of savvy shoppers.</p>
      <p>And we’re not easily swayed - we Scots know how to look for a bargain and won’t part with our hard-earned cash until we’re sure it’s what we’re after.</p>
      <p>And if it’s a mobile phone you’re searching the sales for, this is the best time of year to get one.</p>
      <p>Retailers are falling over themselves to try and get you to look at their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> stalls.</p>
      <p>What shoppers don’t realise is that while some of the deluxe freebies being given away with the latest handsets are worth a couple of hundred quid - that often means a pricey tariff that you’re tied into for anywhere between 12 and 24 months.</p>
      <p>SIM-only is always a great option and <a href="https://fave.co/3369lec">Three Mobile’s 8GB of data for £8 a month for 12 months</a> is ideal for most users. It comes with unlimited calls and texts and is a super-cheap option if you’re not in the market for a new handset - even financial expert, Martin Lewis recommended it on Good Morning Britain during the week.</p>
