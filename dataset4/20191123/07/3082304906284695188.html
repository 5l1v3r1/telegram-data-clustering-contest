        <b>According to reports, Gareth Bale has only one Premier League club in mind, where he has decided to join should he leave Real Madrid in January or next summer – Manchester United.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is <i>Mundo Deportivo</i> who claims, via <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/bale-only-has-one-club-in-mind-if-he-makes-premier-league-return"><i>TeamTalk</i></a> that Bale would still rather join Manchester United than his former club Tottenham Hotspur, despite Jose Mourinho’s appointment as their new head coach.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Spanish newspaper <i>AS </i>reported that Bale will come back to Tottenham as “a treat of Mourinho”, who “intends to make him return to London next summer”.</p>
      <p>But on Friday, <i>Mundo Deportivo</i> claimed that Mourinho’s arrival at Spurs actually “complicates” the Welshman’s expected return to the North London outfit.</p>
      <p>The news agency further added that Manchester United are still “the Premier option” for Bale.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane also asked fans to support the 30-year-old, despite his controversial flag celebration after Wales qualified to the 2020 UEFA Euro Cup.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of noise because of Bale’s gestures but in the end, the most important thing is football,” Zidane said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“Regarding Bale, I am just going to look at the sporting side, not what happens outside.”</p>
      <p>“He is a part of our team. You don’t have to look at anything else. People have to be with Bale because he is with us. He is fine and has trained normally.”</p>
