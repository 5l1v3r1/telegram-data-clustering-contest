India’s richest businessman had hosted a pre-wedding party at his house on 10 November when a host of Bollywood celebrities including Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai and others had joined the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Isha Ambani too was also a star attraction at her cousin’s wedding as she flaunted her shimmery gold <i>lehenga</i> with colourful 3D floral embellishments.
