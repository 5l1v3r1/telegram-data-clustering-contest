      <p>Nigerians who were shocked by the news have taken to social media to react to his response to the allegations. See some reactions below;</p>
      <blockquote>Please before you slander Allen Onyema’s reputation hope you have read the entire document. And you read this paragraph too. – @ChidiRolex<br/><br/>We don’t know the truth about Allen Onyema’s indictment just yet. But i do know one thing, same man stepped-up and saved lives of stranded Nigerians in SA during the xenophobic attacks. Um, let’s take this one with a pinch of salt until he’s proven guilty.🙂 I’m just saying… – @iam_kennyking<br/><br/>“Allen Onyema” Is a great icon. He lifted freely our brothers in SA during xenophobia crisis. He invested back home and helped reduce unemployment in Nigeria. Other countries rich business men too may have 1 or 2 odds against them but they protect their people. Let’s protect OURs – @OFFICIAL_JERRRY<br/><br/>Read this Allen Onyema indictment, I am not a lawyer but from the little I know, I think it’s bogus. First they didn’t say he stole anybody money. Second the monies were transfered from his accounts in Njgeria to his other business’ account in the USA and used to buy planes. – @ronaldnzimora<br/><br/>Stop trying to pull people down with frivolous lies that can’t hold water if tested in the temple of justice. Mr. Allen Onyema has done more for humanity to deserve this your hatred targeted to malign his reputation. Stop this ethnocentric bigotry. – @IPO_censored<br/><br/>Allen Onyema purchased 10 airplanes years back. An American journalist made a phony tweets on how a “3rd world country” business man could afford to purchase that fleet of flight. Today, They’re charging him of Money laundry which they haven’t proven (very unlike them). – @UchePOkoye</blockquote>
