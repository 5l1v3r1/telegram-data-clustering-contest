      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fadnavis, Ajit Pawar form govt; nation stunned</li>
        <li>Sharad Pawar says Ajit's move doesn't have NCP backing</li>
        <li>Warns NCP MLAs against defecting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday said his party didn't support his nephew Ajit Pawar's decision to join a BJP-led government in Maharashtra, and warned his MLAs against offering support to the rebel leader.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, the nation watched in disbelief as Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP and Ajit Pawar took oath at Raj Bhavan in Mumbai -- a development that went very much against the run of play, for the NCP had been in talks with the Shiv Sena and the Congress for days.</p>
      <p>At a joint press conference with the Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawar reminded NCP MLAs of the anti-defection law and said they could lose their membership. He said he'd learned that 10-11 lawmakers had gone with Ajit Pawar, but also that some of them had begun contacting the parent faction.</p>
      <p>NCP MLAs present at the press meet said they didn't know they were being taken to Raj Bhavan for a swearing-in ceremony.</p>
      <p>Later, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said Ajit Pawar would be "alone".</p>
      <p>Sources have said the NCP could expel Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar said at the press meet that a decision on replacing Ajit as the NCP's legislature party leader would be taken at a later meeting.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who spoke after Sharad Pawar, described the morning's developments as a "surgical strike" against Maharashtra and dared the BJP to try and break his party.</p>
      <p>The Congress, which was part of the prospective opposition alliance taking shape in recent days, did not have representatives present at the press meet.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar said a legislature party meeting of the Congress was under way at the time.</p>
