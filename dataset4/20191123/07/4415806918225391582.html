      <p>Arif Ansari, head of news for BBC Asian Network, tweeted a picture showing a handful of chips next to a piece of chicken.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “New rules in the BBC canteen limit the number of chips to six! The staff seemed shocked that I didn’t go with the unlimited couscous instead.”</p>
      <p>Dom Stirling, a freelance radio producer at the BBC, added: “There is currently uproar in the canteen as the ‘6 chip rule’ is introduced… In which servers are instructed to individually count out 6 chips per person. I wish this was a joke.”</p>
      <p>The BBC denied any such rule had been introduced.</p>

      <p>The official Twitter account of its press office shared a picture of a food box containing at least nine chips.</p>
      <p>It said: “There’s something a little fishy about this as there is definitely no six-chip rule (see today’s lunch for evidence!) – we don’t want to get chippy about it but we’re frying to get to the bottom of it.”</p>
