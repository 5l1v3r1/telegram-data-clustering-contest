      <p>Family members, comprising a man, his wife and their son were found dead on Friday in their room located at North Bank, Makurdi, Benue State.</p>
      <p>The incident is coming five days after the acting permanent secretary in the state alongside his wife and two children died in a fire that gutted their residence.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness, who identified himself as Tondo, said the second child of the family, a girl, was spared as the cause of death remained a mystery.</p>
      <p>Tondo said there was no clue to suggest that they were killed because there was no mark of violence on them.</p>
      <p>“We woke up this morning and discovered the development. We found the husband, wife and their son dead.</p>
      <p>“Ironically, nothing happens to their little girl who should be about two years. Policemen were contacted and they took the corpses away,” Tondo said.</p>
      <p>When contacted, the spokesperson for the state police command, Catherine Anene, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, confirmed the incident.</p>
      <p>She said, “We received information from people around the area that three family members were dead. It is investigation that we show us the cause of death because there is no mark of violence on their bodies.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the only girl found alive in the room is about two years old and could not say anything about the incident.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Ogun Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps on Friday said one person died while three others sustained injuries in a road accident on Idiroko Road, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>Sango-Ota Area Commander of TRACE, Adekunle Ajibade, made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria in Ota.</p>
      <p>Ajibade said the accident which happened at 10am on Friday around Iyana-Iyesi on Idiroko Road, involved a tipper, a jeep and a tricycle.</p>
      <p>He stated that the tipper with the number plate, MUS 217 YL, lost control due to brake failure and rammed into a tricycle marked, LAR 304 VD and an Acura Jeep with the number plate, KTU 636 DQ.</p>
      <p>He added said that four persons comprising three males and a female were involved in the accident which resulted in death of one person, while three others sustained injuries.</p>
      <p>“The corpse of the male victim has been deposited at the morgue of the state hospital, Ota while the survivors are also receiving treatment at the same hospital,” Ajibade said.</p>
      <p>Ajibade advised motorists and other road users to be careful as the yuletide period approaches to avoid loss of lives and property.</p>
