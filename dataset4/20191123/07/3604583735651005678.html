      <h1>Celebrating ethically-sourced fresh beef as mobile abattoir company Provenir prepares Victorian launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Ford</a></address>
      <p>It's not often your rhubarb and lemon curd dessert comes with a layer of beef bouillon, or your sorbet with snap-frozen beef rousong.</p>
      <p>Nor are beef sweet breads spotted on the menu much, with panko crumbs and Japanese-style picked vegetables.</p>
      <p>The Talbot Provedore and Eatery, which this week won its third Golden Plate award in a row, hosted a Celebration of Beef last weekend as part of its seasonal dinner series.</p>

      <p>This one was a little different.</p>
      <p>Owners Christopher Howe and Jayne Newgreen are also co-owners of Provenir, a company which has designed Australia's first mobile on-farm abattoir.</p>
      <p>It's taken years of work to design the processing unit, which fits into an over-size truck trailer, and perfect the system.</p>

      <p>Provenir's benefits for farmers and consumers, according to its owners, are reducing stress for livestock, and producing fresher meat, which is noticeably different.</p>
      <p>However, Victorian legislation blocked the Bannockburn-based company from operating in its home state.</p>
      <p>In the past few months, the company has made arrangements with farmers in the Riverina, and the results so far have been spectacular.</p>

      <p>As well as the feedback from chefs and consumers - Ms Newgreen noted there'd been a lot of positive expletives in the written comments - the farmers themselves felt included, as each package of meat includes a QR code, which links to a profile of the farm the beef came from.</p>
      <p>"One farmer, from Spring Creek in NSW, said through Provenir, his name is connected to the steak on the customer's plate, it gives him the opportunity to see in what quality and where their product ends up," Ms Newgreen said.</p>

      <p>"They get a real sense of pride out of that."</p>
      <p>Chefs and home cooks looking for a premium product are genuinely impressed too, she added.</p>
      <p>"We're getting some incredible feedback from chefs, one of the words we keep hearing is juicy - there seems to be some moisture retention in the meat that is not present in other meats," she said.</p>
      <p>"It does cost more to produce, but the demand is there on the consumer side to see quite substantial growth."</p>
      <p>Mr Howe, who helped design the degustation menu with Provedore's head chef Stephan Zimmermann, said Provenir would also promote more ethical eating.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He referred to "the fifth quarter" of an animal, or edible offal, and "nose-to-tail eating".</p>
      <p>"I'm in the unique position of being owner, operator, and a beef operator, so I can access cuts like sweet breads (thymus or pancreas)," he said.</p>
      <p>"I can't think of anyone else in Australia who's in that unique position."</p>

      <p>The degustation menu was designed to "challenge" diners, matched with a selection of Pyrenees wines from Dogrock Winery,which has a red five star James Halliday rating.</p>
      <p>An amuse bouche of boeuf consomme - with local sourdough and truffle oil - was first up, followed by char-grilled beef tongue on vermicelli.</p>
      <p>It was at this stage diners realised what they were in for, though the texture of the tongue was astounding.</p>

      <p>The panko-crumbed sweet breads followed, then crumbed marrow with lentils and the first red of the evening.</p>
      <p>An oxtail boeuf bourguignon, with polenta and salsa verde, was next.</p>
      <p>The chefs were truly showing off with the tissue-paper thin carpaccio of eye of round, before the tender filet de boeuf.</p>

      <p>Eyebrows were raised at the cleanser - beetroot and pomegranate sorbet with the aforementioned dried-out beef rousong - but it was good preparation for the finish, the rhurbarb and lemon curd (from Jayne's garden), with thyme-infused biscuit crumb and the bouillon.</p>
      <p>It was like the sharpness of Vegemite cutting through, when one had a mouthful of every ingredient together.</p>

      <p>While perhaps not for everyone, the adventurousness paid off.</p>
      <p>"I think those dishes, especially with the local wine - we're very much about the local producers and nose-to-tail cooking," Mr Howe explained.</p>
      <p>"I see our role and responsibility as chefs and abattoir operators to use the animal differently, and as meat eaters, we have a responsibility to consume the whole animal, not just the prime cuts we're used to.</p>
      <p>"I see it as a responsibility to push the envelope and challenge people a little bit.</p>

      <p>"The first four courses were all essentially offal, but hopefully the diners would agree there was so much texture and flavour there."</p>
      <p>Now that the legislation has changed - to be specific, the Primary Industry Legislative Amendment has passed through parliament with the words "or vehicle" added to the definition of abattoir - Mr Howe said the company's breathing a sigh of relief before getting onto the next phase.</p>
      <p>"It was a long time coming," he said.</p>
      <p>"What we're busy doing now is canvassing producers in Victoria who have made contact with us over the years, and hopefully we'll hear back in terms of supply."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He envisions a fleet of the mobile processing unit trucks - the abattoirs themselves - servicing central hubs based in regional towns.</p>
      <p>"It'll be supported by up to three mobile processing units that can circulate in a certain radius - anywhere beef is produced in Australia, we see having one of those hubs supported by a number of mobile abattoirs that cover a certain territory," he explained.</p>
      <p>"(Onsite processing) makes the beef the best it can be."</p>
      <p>The state government's PrimeSafe agency and Meat and Livestock Australia were contacted for comment.</p>
