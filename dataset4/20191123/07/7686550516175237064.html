      <h1>Hold the jam! Christmas is not my time to stir up preserves of any kind</h1>
      <h2>I cannot, in short, preserve stuff for toffee...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lynne Barrett-Lee</a></address>
      <p>I have to watch myself at this time of year. This rule holds true generally - from early October right through into January - and specifically, when we reach tomorrow’s key flashpoint, which the cakey-bakey set will already know is ‘stir-up Sunday’.</p>
      <p>My desire to make a timely Christmas cake has never dimmed. It’s one of those ambitions which, though annually scuppered by circumstance (everyone in my family hates Christmas cake, me included) refuses to lie down and die.</p>
      <p>Oh, and before you suggest the ‘make for friends instead’ option, I am already surrounded by friends who make Christmas cake. And though they’ll tell you that their families absolutely LOVE their Christmas cake, there is always an amount of it still circulating in January. A suspicious amount, frankly. Just saying.</p>
      <p>The cake urge is, of course, part response to the media, who, despite (or perhaps because of) a wealth of news about mad bad, and sad middle-aged white men currently, have festive-themed column inches to fill.</p>
      <p>It’s part response to the supermarkets, who have raisins to sell.</p>
      <p>It’s part knee-jerk anxiety about not ‘getting ahead’ enough.</p>
      <p>But the far greater part is evolutionary biology. We’re hard-wired as a species - and this is laughable, when you think about the word I’m about to type next - to ‘conserve’.</p>
      <p>Absolutely nothing wrong about that. Quite the opposite. One of the enduring joys of this summer and autumn has been the regularity with which I’ve fetched up at Luke’s, for nanna duties, to find a pot of homemade red gooseberry jam has been left for me by Charlotte’s parents.</p>
      <p>Another was the year when, as a strapped-for-cash culinary arts student, Luke produced homemade flavoured oils for Christmas presents (yes, a tear was shed).</p>
      <p>So preserving stuff good, gifting preserved stuff even better. There is absolutely nothing not to like here. Specially now, when my companion urge - to buy less, re-purpose stuff more - is so strong.</p>
      <p>But evolution by natural selection has its quirks. Sometimes it creates irresistible evolutionary urges not remotely matched by evolutionary fitness. I give you me - all the Darwinian gear, no idea. Or, rather, ALL the ideas, but without any of the skills required to execute them.</p>
      <p>And this despite a paternal bloodline that boasts a second place certificate for kumquat and ginger jam and a pickled shallot recipe so coveted in East Sussex that, now we’ve inherited it, we have to keep it in a special vault.</p>
      <p>Irony alert - the one thing of Dad’s I most wanted to keep? The preserving pan I bought him in 1979. Because, obviously, it’s in my genes, right?</p>
      <p>So I’m nothing if not committed. I scrub and store jam jars with the commitment of an apocalypse-fearing zealot... though not without a little hard-won self-knowledge.</p>
      <p>I store mostly very LITTLE jars (caper jars, pesto jars, mustard jars and so on) because experience has taught me that, in a majority of cases - Ian and Mary’s delicious jam obviously a happy outlier - the amount left in a jar of gifted homemade seasonal jams or pickles is inversely correlated to the giftee’s desire to keep consuming them - “Enough already with the bloody spiced courgette chutney, PLEASE. It’s been three times already this week!”</p>
      <p>Bottom line, making stuff to be shared, stored and eaten later just feels so damned good. It connects us to our forebears, makes the kitchen smell delicious, speaks to the part of us that wants to toil for the greater good. In the right hands, it’s a joy for all involved in the process.</p>
      <p>It’s just that my hands aren’t necessarily the right hands. Witness the 10 jars of blackberry ‘jam’ that set like concrete. Witness the Christmas pudding (the urge got the better of me - no-one in the family likes that either) that I boiled in a special sphere, for max historical accuracy, and deconstructed to soggy crumbs the very second it was released.</p>
      <p>Witness the spiced courgette chutney, above, that was the colour of silage and contained just two flavour notes – ‘burnt’ and ‘wrong kind of sugar’.</p>
      <p>Witness the peppermint ‘creams’ that ripped out my nanny’s dentures. Witness the pickled shallots (sorry, dad) that had all the crisp bite of lemon curd.</p>
      <p>I cannot, in short, preserve stuff for toffee (even toffee - see ‘dentures’, above).</p>
      <p>This ‘stir-up Sunday’, then, I shall endeavour to stir absolutely nothing. Specially the beast that makes me think I can and that I should.</p>
      <p>No, I’ll gather some twigs from the garden and make a wreath instead. At least that will be intentionally inedible.</p>
