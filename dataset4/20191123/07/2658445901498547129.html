      <p>A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Olumide Aju and a former University of Lagos lecturer who was also a NADECO chieftain, Dr Amos Akingba have challenged Nigerian youths to turn the current challenges the country is going through to motivations to attaining new heights and taking over leadership in the country at all fronts.</p>
      <p>The duo who spoke at reception organised in honour of Aju, recently conferred with the SAN award, were united in their view that youths more than other classes in the country have much at stake and therefore more roles to play in efforts to revamp the country, return her a viable position to perform her roles to her citizen.</p>
      <p>According to the senior advocate, “Nigerian youths must be determined and be focused in the pursuit of their ambition whatever the country is going through today is not enough reason for youths not to attain virtuous life ambition, in other parts of the world youths taking over regardless of the prevailing circumstances, therefore Nigeria should not be an exception.”</p>
