      <h1>Luis Suarez tempted by transfer to MLS with David Beckham's Inter Miami team</h1>
      <h2>Luis Suarez is out of contract at Barcelona at the end of next season. Meanwhile, David Beckham's Inter Miami is set to make their debut in the MLS next season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:39:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Luis Suarez has suggested that he could be tempted with a move to America when his time at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> comes to an end.</p>
      <p>Striker Suarez is out of contract at Barca at the end of next season, but the Catalan giants could choose to cash in on him, and start their rebuilding process, during one of the next three transfer windows.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan has been at Barca since his £65million move from Liverpool in 2014 and has scored 185 times in 260 appearances, having formed a vital partnership with Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>Suarez has been regularly linked with being one of David Beckham's first signings when his MLS side Inter Miami joins the league next season.</p>

      <p>And the 32-year-old has admitted that would be an exciting prospect as he praised the MLS.</p>
      <p>"MLS is a competition which has grown a lot in the last few years and you can see that with the young players that have moved there in the last two years, above all the South Americans," Suarez told <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/3995508/barcelonas-luis-suarez-mls-transfer-a-nice-possibility">ESPN FC.</a></p>
      <p>"That shows that the league wants to grow and not just bring in players of a certain age that are going to retire there. They look for that mix to make the league better.</p>
      <p>"I have a contract with Barca and I am very happy here. In the future you never know, it's an attractive league.</p>

      <p>"Given that I have been lucky to have had success at the top level for a long time, what I would look out for [next] is stability for my family and the well-being of my children. They would all make the decision along with me and the United States is a nice possibility."</p>
      <p>Suarez became a legend at Liverpool during a three and a half season stint at Anfield.</p>
      <p>He narrowly missed out on a Premier League title in his last year at the Reds - where they came second to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and Suarez picked up the Golden Boot.</p>
      <p>The Reds are flying again this year and already boast an eight point gap at the top of the table - and Suarez can't see his former outfit mucking it up.</p>
      <p>"[Winning the Premier League] is difficult because the season is very long," Suarez told <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/3995508/barcelonas-luis-suarez-mls-transfer-a-nice-possibility">ESPN FC.</a> "But they have a nice advantage at the moment and with this current <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> side, it's complicated [to imagine] them letting that slip. But we all know how football is.</p>
      <p>"They had a similar advantage at one stage last season and, in the end, Manchester City won the league.”</p>
      <p>"We were close to winning the league at Liverpool with young players.</p>
      <p>"We almost managed it without the budget they have today. Given everything Liverpool are now, to have won it then would have had more merit."</p>
