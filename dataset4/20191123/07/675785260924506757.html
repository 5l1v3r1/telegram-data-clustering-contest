      <h1>Liverpool's predicted line-up vs Crystal Palace after Mohamed Salah decision</h1>
      <h2>The Reds look to maintain their unbeaten start and build on the eight-point lead they've opened up at the top of the table, although Salah has been a fitness doubt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will be boosted by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-salah">Mohamed Salah's</a> return to fitness in time for the trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>The Egyptian forward faced a battle to recover from a recurrence of an ongoing ankle injury originally sustained at the beginning of last month.</p>
      <p>Salah sported a protective boot whilst on international duty, and played no part in Egypt's scheduled matches.</p>
      <p>He is set to start at Selhurst Park however as Liverpool look to continue their rampant form.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> had several other injury concerns, but captain Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum will both feature after shaking off respective illnesses.</p>

      <p>Andy Robertson will miss out however, after aggravating a persistent ankle problem - similar to Salah's - which forced him to sit out Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifiers last week.</p>
      <p>He will be replaced in the starting XI by the dependable James Milner, who was the Reds' regular left-back prior to Robertson's arrival.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the side, Joel Matip is still ruled out, so Dejan Lovren keeps his place alongside Virgil van Dijk in defence, with Joe Gomez expected to be among the substitutes.</p>

      <p>One man who won't be included on the bench is Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri, despite making his return to training after six weeks out.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has played just 16 minutes of Premier League action so far this season, but boss Jurgen Klopp was adamant Shaqiri will play a key role over the rest of the campaign.</p>
      <p>"He needs to get match fitness again," Klopp said. "He trained this week, we gave him some different things to do. He needs to get used to the intensity again.</p>
      <p>“We are in this season, and for this season Shaqiri is an important player. When I'm with him he's completely happy. It's about getting the intensity back.”</p>
      <p><b>Predicted Liverpool XI vs Crystal Palace:</b> Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Milner, Fabinho, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane</p>
