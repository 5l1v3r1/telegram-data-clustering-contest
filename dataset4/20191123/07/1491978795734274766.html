      <p>My partner is desperate for Apple AirPods Pro wireless earbuds for Christmas, but they cost £250. I’m convinced he’ll lose them in a week. There are £50 wireless ones on the market. Are they really that much different to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> ones? Please recommend me a good, low priced rival.</p>
