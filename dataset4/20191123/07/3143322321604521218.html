      <p>MBOMBELA – According to John Meintjies, chairman of Nelspruit’s Community Policing Forum (CPF), there is definitely an escalation of criminal activity in Mbombela.</p>
      <p>He explained that it is “that time of the year” and people on farms are soft targets.</p>
      <p>“There were six housebreakings reported in the first week of October, which increased to 10 in the first week in November.”</p>

      <p>Victor Uys, communications official of Nelspruit’s Community Policing Sub Forum (CPSF) stated that he had intercepted 12 reported occurrences last week. The offences range from destruction of property, theft, attempted theft and housebreaking.</p>
      <blockquote>“We have seen an increase from three transgressions a month, to seven or more per week. We have already identified two groups or gangs operating in the vicinity of the farms on the R40 Barberton road to just after Hilltop Pass,” he said.</blockquote>
      <p>On November 16 just after 03:00, a BMW R1200 RT motorbike was stolen from a farm next to the R40. Corné Janse van Vuuren, the daughter of the farmer whose bike was stolen, told Lowvelder that the suspects had to use a bakkie to transport it.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is all very well – planned and organised; they obviously had us under constant surveillance and even tried to break in through the fence a week before,” she disclosed.</blockquote>
      <p>“Thankfully, a driver of White River Towing Services saw the bike on the back of the bakkie and when the perpetrators saw him, they abandoned the stolen bike,” Janse van Vuuren said.</p>
      <p>The provincial police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi, said the upsurge in farm burglaries and theft are due to opportunistic criminals taking advantage of the festive season mindset.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is that time of the year when there is a lot going on and people are going on vacation. We want to work with the security companies and CPF to tackle crime during this festive period. We have a current ongoing Safer Festive Season campaign, which will run until March.”</blockquote>
      <p>Hlathi appealed to community members to be extra vigilant.</p>
      <p>Meintjies advised people who stay in rural areas to start WhatsApp groups to keep in touch and organise meetings.</p>

      <p>“They must also establish a CPF sub forum, which will force the police to participate and get involved. You can have the best security system installed, but if the burglars are determined to get into your house, they will find a way. Get to know your neighbour; he is your quickest source of protection,” Meintjies explained.</p>
