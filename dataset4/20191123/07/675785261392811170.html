      <h2>Report card has emerged that showed where young Xavi had room for improvement before becoming one of Barcelona and Spain's greatest ever players</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:41:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona's report card for a 14-year-old has emerged - and the budding midfielder is marked as average in two categories.</p>
      <p>Xavi would go on to become a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> legend and one of the game's greatest ever midfielders.</p>
      <p>He made 767 appearances for Barca, winning four Champions League titles, eight La Liga crowns and the Copa del Rey three times.</p>
      <p>Famed for his passing and positioning and therefore regarded as the embodiment of Barcelona's tiki-taka style of play, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/xavi-hernandez">Xavi</a> is also regarded by many as Spain's greatest ever player.</p>
      <p>He was a vital member of the great Spain teams that won the 2010 World Cup, sandwiched by glory in the 2008 and 2012 European Championships.</p>

      <p>And there are certainly signs of that illustrious future in the report card on a young Xavi's progress at Barcelona's famed academy, La Masia.</p>
      <p>The report has come to light in a new book by Cristian Martin titled 'La Masia'</p>
      <p>Xavi is marked 'excellent' for control and positioning, and very good for passing - qualities that made him the perfect successor to Pep Guardiola as Barcelona's playmaker, and then a crucial member of the latter's all-conquering Barca team between 2008 and 2012.</p>
      <p>However, he is marked as 'average' for speed and aggression. His coaches wrote he had trouble picking up speed, and that his 'eminently technical style' made his aggression 'hard to judge'.</p>
      <p>Those limitations certainly didn't stop him, however. He went on to win 31 trophies with Barcelona - surpassed only by teammate Andreas Iniesta as Spain's most decorated player of all time.</p>
      <p>Xavi is now manager of Quatar Stars League football club Al Sadd.</p>

      <p>Here's what Xavi's report card said about the 14-year-old hopeful, courtesy of Spanish publication <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/11/22/5dd7b617268e3ef3218b4635.html">Marca</a> :</p>
      <p><b>Running:</b> He runs on his heels, his movements are slow and he has trouble picking up speed.</p>
      <p><b>Balance:</b> Average</p>
      <p><b>Coordination:</b> Good. His movements are correct, but lack speed.</p>
      <p><b>Flexibility:</b> Average. He needs a lot of work in this regard.</p>
      <p><b>Skill:</b> Good, without it being his forte. He has the resources in his game to take advantage of any situation.</p>

      <p><b>Fitness:</b> Good. He has everything a good midfielder should.</p>
      <p><b>Muscle endurance:</b> Good.</p>
      <p><b>Speed:</b> Average. He has to improve his agility and speed of movement.</p>
      <p><b>Starting Speed:</b> Average</p>
      <p><b>Rapid strength:</b> Average</p>
      <p><b>Control:</b> Excellent. He offsets his lack of speed in movement with exceptional ball control.</p>
      <p><b>Passing:</b> Very good. He should improve with his left foot, but this is his great strength on the pitch.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Crossing:</b> Good. He is almost never forced into this action.</p>
      <p><b>Shooting:</b> Acceptable. He should improve this for when he gets forward in attack, like Guardiola.</p>
      <p><b>Running:</b> Very good. He has a good sense of protecting the ball, he almost never loses it.</p>
      <p><b>Dribbling:</b> Good. Without being his best asset, his technical level is impressive.</p>
      <p><b>Positioning:</b> Excellent. It is undoubtedly his best quality. He is always where he should be and always offers support and an option for teammates.</p>
      <p><b>Aggression:</b> Average. His eminently technical style sometimes makes this aspect difficult to judge.</p>
