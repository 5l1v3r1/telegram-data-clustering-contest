      <h1>How your number plate could land you with a £1,000 fine - the rules you need to know</h1>
      <h2>Here are 7 car number plate rules every driver should know</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Road safety experts have revealed number plate rules which every driver should know.</p>
      <p>In a bid to make the country's roads safer, they are encouraging motorists to ensure their number plates are legally sound.</p>
      <p>According to LeaseCar.uk, it's becoming increasingly common to see registration numbers displayed with quirky fonts, sizes and even the incorrect gapping.</p>
      <p>However, number plate offences could see individuals dealt a hefty fine of £1,000, with the vehicle also failing its MOT test.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from LeaseCar.uk said: “Customising cars can be part of the fun of owning one, being able to choose the make, model and colour to match your needs.</p>
      <p>“There is, however, a line which must not be crossed.</p>
      <p>"A registration number is essentially a car’s passport – and you wouldn’t change the format of your own.</p>
      <p>“They carry lots of important information to do with tax and licencing, and so not following the rules can result in some very large fines.”</p>
      <p>These are seven rules every motorist should follow when it comes to number plates:</p>
      <h3>1. Background</h3>
      <p>Depending on where your number plates are placed, the background colours should be different.</p>
      <p>Those at the front of a vehicle should have a white background, with the rear number plate having a yellow background.</p>
      <h3>2. Font</h3>
      <p>There is a standard font which must be used for number plates.</p>
      <p>Characters cannot be in italics – as was previously allowed before 2001 – but you can personalise the font, only in making the characters 3D.</p>
      <h3>3. Visibility</h3>
      <p>Number plates must be displayed at all times on the vehicle – both front and back – and the letters and numbers must be visible at all times, so make sure they’re kept clean.</p>
      <p>Theft resistant plates are available to make it more difficult for them to be removed.</p>
      <h3>4. Size</h3>
      <p>In order to ensure number plates are easy to read, there are lots of specific measurements with regards to the individual characters.</p>
      <p>They must be 79mm tall and the thickness of the black print 14mm. More details can be found on the government website.</p>
      <h3>5. Flags</h3>
      <p>You are allowed to display a flag on the left-hand side of the number plate, but only if it relates to the destination the car’s from.</p>
      <p>They must be smaller than 5mm wide. A GB sticker must be displayed if you plan to travel in Europe – a flag on the number plate will suffice.</p>
      <h3>6. Formation</h3>
      <p>Each car is issued with a regular formation of two letters, which identifies where the car was originally registered, two numbers which show the age of the car, followed by three random letters.</p>
      <p>It is illegal to put plates on a car which makes it look younger than it is.</p>
      <h3>7. Personalised plates</h3>
      <p>Personalised number plates can also be purchased. These adhere to all of the above rules, apart from they can follow different formations.</p>
      <p>These plates don’t show the age of the car, one of the reasons individuals may choose to buy them.</p>
