      <h1>Saudi Aramco's Bid To Starve The U.S. Market Failed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:26:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:26</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Boslego</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aramco's strategy was to target the U.S. market for reduced exports.</li>
        <li>The goal was to reduce U.S. crude stocks to push prices up for its IPO.</li>
        <li>But the plan failed.</li>
        <li>U.S. domestic production rose along with non-OPEC imports.</li>
        <li>Now the IPO is failing vs. the targeted valuation and lack of international participation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Last December, Saudi Aramco (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARMCO">ARMCO</a>) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/oil-holds-near-lows-as-supply-outlook-makes-for-cautious-market">notified</a> U.S. oil refiners of a "steep drop" in crude oil exports to the U.S. starting in January. This was part of a plan to drain U.S. crude inventories to shore-up prices. The idea was that U.S. stocks are reported weekly, and so a drop in U.S. crude stocks would have an outsized impact on world oil prices.</p>

      <p>And imports from Saudi Arabia were sharply reduced in 2019. In the year-to-date, Saudi imports are down 38% vs. last year. As of the four weeks ending November 15th, imports were about 65% lower than over the same weeks a year ago.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, U.S. crude stocks have built about 10 million barrels year-to-date. That was not as much as last year, but stocks are still higher than a year ago.</p>

      <p>U.S. crude imports have been 13% lower year-to-date than last year, over one million barrels per day. But net imports (including exports) have been 34% lower in the same comparison, that's more than 2 million barrels per day.</p>
      <p>Domestic crude production in 2019 was about 1.5 million barrels per day higher y-o-y in 2019 vs. 2018. And "other" petroleum supplies (mainly NGLs) were almost 500,000 b/d higher.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude imports from OPEC countries dropped by 1.1 million barrels per day through August. But imports from non-OPEC countries rose by 151,000 b/d. The U.S. has been replacing OPEC barrels with non-OPEC barrels over the past several years and by domestic production.</p>

      <p>And so the Aramco strategy to try to embargo the U.S. in order to create a shortfall and support world prices for its IPO did not work. And speaking of the IPO, Aramco decided to cancel its international road show due to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-petronas/aramco-ipo-its-a-thanks-but-no-thanks-from-petronas-idUSKBN1XW0JD">lack of interest</a> from foreign institutional investors. Aramco has yet to name any major foreign investors.</p>
      <p>Instead, wealthy local investors have <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Wealthy-Saudis-Are-Being-Bullied-Into-Buying-Aramco.html">reportedly</a> been "strong armed," "coerced" and "bullied" into being anchor investors. And the Kingdom has <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Latest-Trick-To-Boost-Aramco-Investment.html">doubled</a> the leverage limit for retail investors who buy shares in Aramco.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aramco's strategy to force U.S. crude inventories lower with target export cuts to the U.S. has failed. And now it cannot get the $2 trillion valuation it wanted, nor international participation at the $1.6 to $1.7 trillion valuation it currently seeks. Instead, it had to coerce wealthy Saudis to invest and bend its banking rules to get local retail investors to participate.</p>
