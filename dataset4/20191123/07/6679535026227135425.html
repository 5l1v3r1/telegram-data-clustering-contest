      <h2>A mockery of democracy, say CPI, RJD</h2>

      <p>The Left parties and the Rashtriya Janata Dal were the only Opposition parties to speak out against the abrupt developments in Maharashtra. The Trinamool Congress and the Telugu Desam Party, two leading forces in the Opposition unity, have remained mum.</p>
      <p>The CPI(M) Polit Bureau in a statement here said the events showed that the political immorality of the BJP had reached its nadir. The party, which was denied a berth in the Congress-NCP alliance, won one seat in the recent Assembly polls.</p>
      <p>“The clandestine manner in which the Chief Minister and his Deputy have been sworn in shows the extent to which the BJP can stoop to grab power,” it said in a statement here.</p>
      <p>The BJP did similar political machinations, the party said, in Goa, Karnataka and the northeastern States.</p>
      <p>“It is unfortunate that both the Constitutional authorities — the President’s office and the Governor’s office — have been misused to achieve their political purpose,” it said.</p>
      <p>CPI general secretary D. Raja called the events a mockery of democracy. “The BJP has manipulated the situation with all the powers at its command. Even before the people of Maharashtra could wake up from their sleep, a new Chief Minister and a Deputy Chief Minister were in place. The office of the Governor and the President have been misused by the Narendra Modi government,” he told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>While RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav hasn’t yet spoken or tweeted on the issue, the official handle of the party said in a tweet in Hindi that a joke had been played on voters and if it continued people would lose faith in democracy. “For the last few years, the way governments are being formed by misusing the Governor, buying and selling, forcibly, it is a joke on the people of the country, the Constitution and democracy!,” the RJD said.</p>
      <p>The party said India was the only country to see such “shameful circus” for power. “If it goes on people will lose faith in democracy!”.</p>
