      <p>The English Premier League, the top tier of English football, comes second to none in terms of following, with an incredible global TV audience of 3.3 billion. In a league that attracts such a huge following, there are some very interesting stats that make it even more fascinating to watch. Here is a compilation of 7 <a href="https://www.betway.co.ke/blog/little-known-facts-about-the-english-premier-league">facts about the English Premier League</a> you probably didn’t know you could bet on with Betway:</p>
      <h3>1. Ryan Giggs is the most decorated player in English Football</h3>
      <p>Welsh Ryan Giggs played and scored for <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/?s=Manchester+United+">Manchester United</a> in 21 consecutive seasons, the only player to ever achieve that in the EPL. He may have hang his boots quarter-way into his last season where he did not find the net, but his stats are amazing. He made 632 appearances for the Red Devils, winning 13 Premier League titles. Beat that!</p>
      <h3>2. Allan Shearer holds the Premier League’s top scorer award</h3>
      <p>The newly-turned TV pundit played for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers, and finally Newcastle United in a career spanning almost two decades. He scored 283 league goals (including 11 hat-tricks), a tally no one has ever been able to match to date. Lethal!</p>
      <h3>3. Peter Crouch scored 53 headed goals</h3>
      <p>The tall forward may not have possessed the physique of a lethal finisher, but he beat all odds to amass an incredible haul of 53 headed goals in the English Premier League. Allan Shearer had previously held the record for headers with 46 of them, but the former Stoke striker beat him to that.</p>
      <h3>4. Mario Balotelli had one goal assist in 70 appearances</h3>
      <p>Super Mario was not so super after all. The former Manchester City and<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/?s=+Liverpool+"> Liverpool</a> forward had only one successful assist throughout his premier league spell in 70 league appearances. It was a case of saving the best for last, though, as his assist to Sergio Aguero handed the Citizens their first English Premier League trophy in 44 years.</p>
      <h3>5. Sir Alex Ferguson is the most successful manager in the English Premier League</h3>
      <p>Retired former Manchester United Manager Sir Alex Ferguson won 13 EPL titles with the Red Devils, a record that no other manager will come close to breaking in our time. He famously announced that he was coming to Manchester United to end Liverpool’s dominance in the local scene, which he most definitely did.</p>
      <h3>6. James Milner never loses when he scores</h3>
      <p>Remember this name; Mr. Dependable has never lost in a match in which he has found the back of the net. Darius Vassell previously held the record for scoring in 46 league matches without losing, but Liverpool’s James Milner has since broken that. Given he is still actively playing for the European Champions; we don’t know how far Millie will stretch it. As you follow the EPL from every corner of the globe, here is a tip; you can always bet on matches with Betway for Liverpool not to lose when Milner scores.</p>
      <h3>7. Sergio Aguero is the only active player to score 5 in a single match</h3>
      <p>Of the five players to ever strike five times in a match, only Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero is still playing in the EPL. He achieved that fete in a 6-1 drubbing of Newcastle in 2015. Other players include the retired trio of Allan Shearer, Dimitar Berbatov, Andy Cole, and Jermain Defoe who is currently playing for Glasgow Rangers in the Scottish Premier League.</p>
