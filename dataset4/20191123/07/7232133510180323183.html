      <p>Ethereum has had the week from hell. Despite solid fundamentals and a growing decentralized finance ecosystem, the world’s second largest crypto asset has dumped 20% since Monday. A major upgrade is imminent for the ETH network but can it revive prices?</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Istanbul Imminent</h3>
      <p>The eighth hard fork for the Ethereum blockchain is upon us and will occur in two weeks’ time around December 6 according to the <a href="https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/9069000">Istanbul countdown</a>. The fixed block number for the transition is 9069000 and the network upgrade is one of many on the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/11/buterin-in-beast-mode-as-work-on-ethereum-2-0-continues/">path to Serenity</a>, or ETH 2.0.</p>
      <p>ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin posted an update detailing the changes taking place on the network.</p>

      <p>There will be six Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) implemented to improve security, interoperability and reduce network costs.</p>
      <p>The first, EIP-152, allows easier interoperability between <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/how-ethereum-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-digital-finance-powerhouse/">Ethereum</a> and Zcash in addition to other Equihash-based proof of work tokens. This is achieved by implementing the Blake2 hash function. EIP-1108 is involved with precompiling gas costs which will assist a number of privacy solutions and scaling solutions.</p>
      <p>EIP-1344 is a security improvement which uses the chain ID to prevent replay attacks between different chains while EIP-1844 reprices certain opcodes, or instruction sets on the Ethereum Virtual Machins, to obtain a good balance between gas expenditure and resource consumption.</p>
      <p>Gas costs for calling on-chain data are reduced with EIP-2028. This will have the effect of increasing the bandwidth as more data can fit into each single block. Finally, EIP-2200 also deals with gas costs by providing a structured definition of net gas metering changes for contract storage.</p>
      <p>Ethereum holders will not be affected but exchanges and third part wallets may require some additional action according to the article.</p>
      <p>There will be further hard forks after Istanbul in the run up to Serenity which will begin with the rollout of Beacon Chain. This is a Proof of Stake blockchain which marks the execution of the long-planned switched from PoW to PoS consensus mechanism. The <a href="https://media.consensys.net/the-roadmap-to-serenity-bc25d5807268">roadmap</a> has been simplified in this video.</p>

      <h3>ETH Price Update</h3>
      <p>It has been hoped that these long awaited network upgrades will bring more security, stability and scalability to the Ethereum blockchain. It is also hoped that ETH prices will get a much needed boost as they’re currently down in the doldrums and have been for much of the past year.</p>
      <p>Since this time last week ETH has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/23/is-there-bigger-plunge-awaiting-for-bitcoin-why-analysts-target-6k/">followed its big brother</a> into the digital abyss and dumped 20%. It dumped to a seven month low of $140 overnight but has recovered slightly to return to support at $150 at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>Since Ethereum has failed to decouple from Bitcoin any further losses could see the token plunge down to $135 before any attempt at recovery is made. Fundamentally though things are looking good with upgrades rolling out and a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/how-does-the-ethereum-dump-affect-defi-markets/">growing DeFi ecosystem</a> at a time when decentralized banking is in great need.</p>
