      <p>Samsung Galaxy A81 Might Launch with S Pen Stylus Support<br/>2 (40%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>At the beginning of every single year, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> announces its top of the line flagship smartphone under the Galaxy S lineup. It seems like this time the smartphone maker might also be unveiling a brand new Galaxy A smartphone. A recent report suggests that the chaebol might be working on <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/17/galaxy-a80-will-get-a-new-256gb-storage-variant/">Galaxy A81</a> with the S-Pen stylus support. If this report is to be believed, this will be the first Samsung smartphone to feature S-Pen stylus except for the obvious Galaxy Note devices.</p>
      <h3>Samsung SM-AN815F Could Be the Samsung Galaxy A81</h3>
      <p>A new Samsung smartphone with the model number SM-AN815F recently made an appearance online. Generally, every single Samsung smartphone or tablet comes with a model number that starts with SN followed by a single letter. For instance, the S-series lineup follows SM-Gxxxx while the Note lineup comes with the SM-Nxxxx model. The A-series, on the other hand, features a model number that looks like this SM-Axxxx. Well, the recently surfaced SM-AN815F is quite different since it does not follow any of the standard model numbers.</p>
      <p>As per the recent report, this device could very well be the Samsung Galaxy A81 with the S-Pen stylus support. The N in the model number might indicate the inclusion of S-Pen stylus. Considering previous reports that indicate that the Galaxy A91 and Galaxy S10 Lite both are the same smartphones, we might have the rebranded Galaxy Note 10 Lite here for some markets. It would be interesting to see whether the smartphone maker brings the support of stylus to the cheaper Galaxy A lineup.</p>
      <p>As of now, we donâ€™t have much information on the Galaxy A81 smartphone except for the fact that it will come with a 128GB onboard memory. Furthermore, no software is currently in the development stage for this device meaning information like this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Although if the brand does end up launching a Galaxy A81, it would be interesting to see whether it will feature a swivel camera system like its predecessor or not.</p>
