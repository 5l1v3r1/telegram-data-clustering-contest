      <h1>Tottenham fans react as Michel Vorm gets injured</h1>
      <h2>Paulo Gazzaniga is the only senior goalkeeper.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:45:44+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Michel Vorm, signed to cover for Hugo Lloris, has picked up an injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1197513196162170880">Tottenham Hotspur’s official Twitter page has given an injury update</a> on a number of players. This includes notifying the fans of Vorm’s injury – which he picked up in training.</p>
      <p>Vorm was released by Tottenham last summer but he re-signed recently. Lloris dislocated his elbow when conceding a goal against Brighton, leaving Tottenham light in the goalkeeper department.</p>
      <p>With Lloris out until the new year at the earliest, Paulo Gazzaniga took the number one spot. Vorm was brought in to provide experienced cover while Alfie Whiteman waits in reserve.</p>

      <p>But now Vorm has joined Lloris on the sidelines. <a href="https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1197513196162170880">Tottenham confirmed</a> that the Dutch goalkeeper has suffered a calf strain. He picked up the injury in training earlier this week and will not return to action until December.</p>
      <p>Tottenham fans have been frustrated with a number of injuries this season. But Vorm’s is bordering on ridiculous. The 36-year-old was only signed to fill in while Lloris was injured but now he has picked up an injury too.</p>
      <p>Here are some fans reacting to the Vorm update.</p>
