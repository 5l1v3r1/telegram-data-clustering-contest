      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are up against their former manager Roy Hodgson when they take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Reds are unbeaten in the league this season and hold an eight-point lead at the top after a 3-1 win over champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in their last game.</p>
      <p>Palace, on the other hand, have lost three of their last four top-flight games and will be desperate to avoid a fourth consecutive home league defeat by the Reds.</p>
      <p>It is sure to be an entertaining encounter as both teams look to return from the international break in impressive fashion.</p>
