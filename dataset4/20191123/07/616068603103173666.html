      <p>There are more woes for the beleaguered BC forest industry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/new-shutdown-to-put-thousands-of-b-c-loggers-out-of-work-monday-1.4698655">CTV News Vancouver Island</a> is reporting forest management company Mosaic plans to temporarily shutter its logging operations.</p>
      <p>The company said harvesting operations will cease on Monday, Nov. 25, a move that will impact roughly 2,000 workers.</p>
      <p>“We are currently experiencing very challenging pricing and market conditions,” said Pam Agnew, communications manager for Mosaic Forest Management. “As a result, we are shutting down earlier, ahead of a usual winter shutdown.”</p>
      <p>The company’s website says it employs people throughout Vancouver Island and Coastal B.C. </p>
      <p>“The temporary curtailment impacts contractors, both union and non-union – approximately 2,000 people across the coast,” said Agnew. </p>
      <p>In the Okanagan, Tolko Industries has recently announced plant closures, slow downs and layoffs.</p>
