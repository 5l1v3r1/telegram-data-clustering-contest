      <h1>IBAC probe into alleged council corruption not a moment too soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">The Age's View</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ibac.vic.gov.au/investigating-corruption/public-examinations/operation-sandon">opening statement</a> of an investigation delving into alleged corruption at a council in Melbourne's south-east lays out a simple proposition by quoting a High Court judge: "One universally recognised form of corruption is for a public official to receive money in a private capacity in circumstances calculated to influence the performance of the official's public duties." In many respects, the principle of quid pro quo goes to the heart of the anti-corruption probe by IBAC into the City of Casey.</p>
      <p>Taking in the rapidly-growing suburbs of Cranbourne, Berwick, Clyde and Hallam, the council gives the thumbs up, or down, to thousands of planning applications each year. For the decisions to be above reproach requires diligent adherence by councillors and staff to transparency and full disclosure to conflicts of interest. The City of Casey fell well short on both fronts.</p>

      <p>At the centre of the allegations is John Woodman, a multi-millionaire who has plied his trade as planning consultant and developer across Melbourne since the 1990s. His who’s who client list has included, or includes, the Fox, Ansett and Baillieu-Myer clans, as well as Tony Madafferi, the man police have alleged to be Melbourne’s mafia boss.</p>
      <p>The IBAC public hearings have revealed Mr Woodman doled out cash to a multitude of political candidates and parties, councillors and private individuals to help smooth the way for developments he was shepherding through the various planning authorities. Of particular interest to the investigation is the personal largesse Mr Woodman handed out to Casey councillors Sam Aziz and Geoff Ablett, to the tune of at least $1.2 million. In return, it's claimed, the councillors did his bidding without ever revealing the money that had come their way.</p>
      <p>Mr Woodman also admitted supporting candidates during an election was useful. During the 2014 state election he was the single biggest property industry donor to the Liberal Party. In 2018, he lobbied senior Andrews government figures while bankrolling Labor candidates with donations worth $158,000. "My experience since the early '90s has been that supporting political parties during an election campaign will promote the opportunity during the elected time to meet with people and discuss a particular issue," Mr Woodman told the IBAC inquiry, adding that the system was stacked against those who could not pay for access.</p>

      <p>Melbourne is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, adding 327 people a day. As the state government implements the biggest infrastructure build in the state's history, there is a multitude of private housing developments being proposed or constructed that can bring in huge profits. Getting the green light to rezone a sizeable piece of farmland into a residential area can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no shortage of financial incentive.</p>
      <p>Among the <a href="https://www.ibac.vic.gov.au/investigating-corruption/public-examinations/operation-sandon">IBAC inquiry's stated goals</a> is to take a very close look at the transparency and integrity of planning and property development decision-making within Victoria, including donations to political candidates, that may result in possible corruption. It will also focus in on whether the use of professional lobbyists or planning consultants to lobby governments has resulted in undue influence over those making the decisions. By the looks of what is going on at the City of Casey, and possibly statewide, it is not a moment too soon.</p>
