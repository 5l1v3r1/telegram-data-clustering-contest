      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. &gt;&gt; Amazon has pulled more than a dozen skin-lightening products with dangerous mercury levels off its website after pushback from Minnesota public-health and environmental activists.</p>
      <p>The Seattle-based company’s change came after the BeautyWell Project and the Sierra Club’s state branch delivered a petition on Wednesday with over 23,000 signatures to Amazon’s fulfillment center in Shakopee.</p>
      <p>That day, the two organizations also took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper demanding that Amazon stop selling toxic skin-lightening creams. The ad had three words in bold print — “Dangerous, racist, and illegal.”</p>
      <p>An Amazon spokesperson told Minnesota Public Radio News in an email Thursday that such products are “no longer available.”</p>
      <p>As of Thursday, all but one of the 15 products with high mercury levels appeared to be removed from Amazon’s website.</p>
