      <p>Eighty years ago, millions of our grandparents went to war, confronting unimaginable terror as they faced Hitler’s Nazi troops on battlefields around Europe, Africa and beyond.</p>
      <p>This fascinating four-part documentary series sees some of the country’s most celebrated actors - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/helena-bonham-carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a>, Mark Rylance, Kristin Scott Thomas and Carey Mulligan - retrace the footsteps of their brave ancestors during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>At historic locations ranging from the beaches of Dunkirk to Prisoner of War camps in Asia, they uncover emotional tales of heroism, sacrifice and suffering.</p>

      <p>In the first episode, movie star Helena learns about her maternal grandfather Eduardo Propper de Callejon, a Spanish diplomat, and her paternal grandmother Lady Violet Bonham, a liberal politician.</p>
      <p>"They weren’t conventional war heroes," she explains.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t win any medals, but I want to discover what they did for myself."</p>
      <p>Eduardo and his family lived in a grand mansion outside Paris, but the Nazi invasion of France saw them flee the capital to seek sanctuary in Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>It was there that Eduardo used his diplomatic powers at the Spanish consulate to grant countless transport visas, so Jewish refugees could escape to Portugal before the Gestapo arrived and sent them to death camps.</p>

      <p>"Eduardo defied the orders of the Spanish government," Helena says.</p>
      <p>"He spent a whole week, day and night, incessantly signing visas which helped thousands of Jews escape the Holocaust."</p>
      <p>Back in the UK, the actress then researches the life of her grandmother Lady Violet, a Baroness, politician and writer who was close friends with Winston Churchill.</p>

      <p>Violet warned about Hitler and the rise of fascism in the 1930s before the war broke out - a campaign which saw her marked for execution by the Nazis.</p>
      <p>Later, during the Luftwaffe’s bombing blitz of London, Violet fearlessly volunteered as an air raid warden, putting her own life at great risk.</p>
      <p>"It was very dangerous, so Violet was both brave and completely bonkers," says Helena, who is currently starring in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-crown">The Crown</a> on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a>.</p>
      <p>"I’m so proud of both my grandparents," says Helena.</p>
      <p>"In the face of strong opposition, they stood up for what they believed in."</p>
