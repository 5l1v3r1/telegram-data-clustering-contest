      <p>An ongoing labour dispute is 'killing' a small BC logging town.</p>
      <p>Port McNeill Mayor Gabriele Wickstrom wrote the open letter to United Steelworkers union negotiator Brian Butler and Western Forest Products labour director Roger MacDougall, and posted it to her Facebook page Friday morning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/forestry-strike-killing-our-communities-says-vancouver-island-mayor-1.4698054">CTV News Vancouver Island</a> is reporting Wickstrom told the two sides, "It’s killing our communities and heartbreaking to see what it’s doing to people. We are struggling and reaching the point where it is going to be very difficult to come back from. We are resilient and look after each other, but we can only take so much before we break.</p>
      <p>"Independent contractors are on the edge of losing their equipment and livelihoods. People have had vehicles repossessed and many more have voluntarily returned them so as not to affect their credit rating,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>"I am begging you, for the sake of every person that lives in a coastal community, to get back into a room together and work out a deal.”</p>
