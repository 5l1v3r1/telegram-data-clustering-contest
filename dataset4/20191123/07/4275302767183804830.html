      <p>Vladimir Matousek, of Nursery Street, Forfar, was caught in the town’s West High Street on October 1 with a breath alcohol reading of 104 microgrammes, against a legal limit of 22.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Derek Reekie told the 60-year-old: “When I heard you decided to drive to the chip shop that is even more alarming.”</p>
      <p>Matousek, who pled guilty, was fined £400 and banned from driving for 18 months.</p>
