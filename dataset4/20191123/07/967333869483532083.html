        <b>Amazon filed a lawsuit on Friday with the Court of Federal Claims in Washington - filed under seal - to challenge the awarding of a lucrative US Department of Defence (DoD) cloud-computing contract worth as much as $10 billion to Microsoft.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the Seattle-based e-commerce giant, the core claims of the suit comprise “unmistakable bias” and “political influence”, which allegedly spoiled the decision-making process, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/22/amazon-files-protest-pentagons-billion-jedi-award-under-seal/">The Washington Post said</a>.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911181077338097-despite-legal-troubles-amazon-india-still-a-draw-for-ceo-jeff-bezos/">reportedly mentions</a>, particularly, the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure cloud-computing project, also known as JEDI.</p>
      <blockquote>The Jedi project attracted media attention earlier this year when the DoD's Inspector General office kicked off a probe into the project after public concerns emerged that the Pentagon was favoring awarding the lucrative contract to Amazon.</blockquote>
      <p>Friday's complaint reportedly includes the July comments of US President Donald Trump, who publicly questioned whether the JEDI contract was competitive enough, citing complaints from Microsoft, Oracle and International Business Machines.</p>
      <blockquote>“We also believe it’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077313976-twitterstorm-as-amazon-sells-blood-capsules-to-fake-virginity-on-first-night/">is free from political influence</a> [...] Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias - and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified”, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said, cited by The Washington Post.</blockquote>
      <p>Microsoft has filed to intervene in the protest, giving it an opportunity to participate in the case.</p>
      <p>Both legal challenges will reportedly delay the Pentagon’s implementation of a multibillion contract the DoD considers critical to its technological upgrade. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910271077159044-trump-told-mattis-screw-amazon-regarding-pentagon-contract-new-book-claims/">JEDI is reportedly meant</a> to create a powerful computing system that can centralize US military agency, from simple logistics to full-scale combat operations.</p>
