      <h1>Are The Recent Arrests Of Prominent Figures Due To Political Pressure?</h1>

      <p>Political analysts are divided on whether this week’s arrests of several high-profile people by the Hawks was the result of political pressure.</p>
      <p>There have been growing calls from citizens for perpetrators of state capture and other crimes against the state to be prosecuted and for assets to be seized.</p>
      <p>However, given the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) track record of going after political opponents in the past, there are concerns around this week’s blitz.</p>
      <p>Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said despite having an NPA head who has integrity, the coordinated nature of this week’s arrests has raised suspicion.</p>
      <p>“Characteristically, these people fall within the classification of former President Jacob Zuma’s allies.”</p>
      <p>African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament and chairperson of Parliament’s portfolio committee on home affairs, Bongani Bongo, was granted R5,000 bail after he was arrested on corruption charges.</p>
      <p>The Hawks also swooped on 10 government officials linked to a dodgy toilet tender in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>Political analyst Lukhona Mnguni said given the political landscape, there could never be certainty when it came to potential interference.</p>
      <p>“There senior political figures in our country that have friends and all sorts of associates within the criminal justice network and they leverage on these.”</p>
      <p>The prosecuting authority said the investigation into the Estina Dairy Farm would be completed this month, meaning more political figures could be in handcuffs.</p>
