      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> customers will be able to save money while buying groceries this month as part of the supermarket's new fuel deal.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can get 10p off every litre when they spent £60 in stores.</p>
      <p>The discount will be available until December 1 and applies to a single shop either in-store or online, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/new-tesco-fuel-deal-give-20919800">Mirror Online reports</a>.</p>
      <p>If you shop in-store, your receipt will automatically include a money-off fuel coupon if you spend at least £60.</p>
      <p>Online shoppers will instead get a fuel coupon when their shopping is delivered.</p>
      <p>Their coupons can be redeemed at any UK Tesco fuel station kiosk.</p>
      <p>However, the deal excludes anything you buy at any café, tobacco kiosk, opticians, phone store, concessions, travel money or Tesco Bank.</p>
      <p>When you receive your fuel coupons, you have two weeks to redeem it.</p>
      <p>Online shoppers have until December 15 to use their coupons however.</p>
