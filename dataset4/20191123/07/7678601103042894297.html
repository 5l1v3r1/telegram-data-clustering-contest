      <h1>Step aside, boomers: Here's Jokowi's new 'millennials' team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:46:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:46</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The State Palace has welcomed seven new faces to the 12-member presidential expert staff. They will assist President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo in making creative and innovative “breakthroughs” in his second and final term in office.</p>
      <p>Aged 23 to 36 years old, with different backgrounds and areas of expertise, the seven millennials will advise the President on subjects including education, entrepreneurship, creative industry, disabled rights and religious tolerance.  </p>
      <p>Jokowi introduced the seven new members of his closest circle on the veranda of Merdeka Palace on Thursday. They sat on colorful bean bag chairs, evoking the atmosphere of a startup ─ the preferred office for many of the world’s millennials.</p>
      <p>The President also posted a picture of the introduction event to his Instagram account <i>@jokowi.</i></p>
      <p>“As members of the presidential expert staff, they will be my partners in discussion every month, every week or every day,” Jokowi wrote in the caption, “With them, I can look for out-of-the-box ideas and leaping breakthroughs towards development.”</p>
      <p>Here are the names Jokowi’s new millennial presidential expert staff members.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Hi, my name is Angkie,” she said after Jokowi’s official announcement. With her right hand, she spelled her name in sign language.</p>
      <p>“I’m a woman with a disability, a woman with special needs who has been given the great opportunity by <i>Bapak</i> President to stand here and speak on behalf of 21 million of people with disability in Indonesia.”</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old with hearing impairment is a social entrepreneur, an activist for the disabled community and an author. She is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Thisable Enterprise, an organization that supports the employment of disabled people.</p>
      <p>One of Thisable’s projects is to partner with ride-hailing app provider Gojek to employ people with disabilities in Gojek’s services like GoAuto for automotive services and GoGlam for beauty services.</p>
      <p>Angkie has published three books – <i><u>Perempuan Tuna Rungu Menembus Batas</u></i> (A Deaf Woman without Limits) in 2011, <i>Setinggi Langit</i> (As High As The Sky) in 2013 and <i>Become Rich As a Socio-preneur</i> in 2019.</p>
      <p> “Here comes the time when [people with] disabilities are no longer seen as minority. We are equal. By becoming a member of the presidential expert staff, it’s my chance to create an inclusive environment. Wish me luck,” she said.</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old is the founder and CEO of education technology startup Ruangguru. He holds a Master of Public Administration and Master of Business Administration from Harvard University and Stanford University in the United States (US), respectively.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Forbes listed Belva and Iman Usman, another Ruangguru cofounder, under its “30 under 30 Asia” for establishing the startup, which connected private tutors with students in Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Belva said it would have been “unimaginable” under the previous administration or in other countries for “young people like us to enter the circle of the State Palace”.</p>
      <p>“This shows a huge commitment from the president to involve the millennial generation in public policy," he said.</p>
      <p>Belva said he and other young staff members had different areas of expertise, but he underlined the importance of maximizing technology in the delivery of public services.</p>
      <p>“In health care, finance and taxes, for instance, perhaps we can think about new ways to apply technology so that we are not left behind other countries.”</p>

      <p>“We are committed to help the President and the government not to work in ‘business-as-usual’ mode, but we will try to implement modernity and technology to realize more effective and efficient governance,” Billy said.</p>
      <p>Billy, who worked for nine years to teach children in remote areas about entrepreneurship, said he would bring his experience to help the government reach out to the country’s outer regions through digital means.</p>
      <p>He said that he and Jokowi were committed to “building Indonesia from Papua”.</p>
      <p> “All along the [narrative] is to develop Papua from Indonesia, but now we will build Indonesia from Papua.”</p>
