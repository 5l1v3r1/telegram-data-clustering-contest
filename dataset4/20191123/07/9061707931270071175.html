      <h2>Have a look at the place you recognise</h2>

      <p>We bet not many people take the time to do this as they go about their daily lives in Burton.</p>
      <p>Whether it's picking up a sandwich at lunch time or buying a few provisions, it's a dead cert that not many people stop to look up as they head out around Burton.</p>
      <p>But the next time you rush out to pick up your lunch or head into one of the shopping centres, stop and look above your head - you will get a whole new view of the town for sure.</p>
      <p>For there are some amazing buildings to admire in the town.</p>
      <p>Walking around the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">streets of Burton</a>, it seems logical that it would not occur to most people to look up at what's above their heads.</p>
      <p>However, doing so will give you a whole new take on Burton and may help you learn a lot more about the place you live.</p>
      <p>Of course, make sure you don't fall for the danger of walking into a lamppost while distracted from what's directly in front of you.</p>
      <p>But by restricting yourself to only seeing what's available at eye-level, you're doing yourself out of a touch of the historic intrigue you could be enjoying about Burton.</p>
      <p>But not to worry to save you from sustaining neck strain injuries, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">we've had a wander round </a>and looked at the top of some of the buildings you probably walk past every day, but don't realise just how significant they are to your town's heritage.</p>

      <h3>A 'look up' at Burton's heritage</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Burton Market Hall</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877257.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-16-at-173546_resultjpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>The market hall has taken pride of place for traders down the years and carries a very interesting sculpture above one of the entrances.</p>
          <p>It is a depiction of an event - the nature of which remains something of a mystery - back in the 11th century involving the monks who lived in the neighbouring abbey, which was where the Winery restaurant now is.</p>
          <p>It carries writing beneath reading: "King John bringing charter granting a fair and weekly market at Burton and confirming the rights and liberties of the abbot and monks of Burton."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Row of shops in Station Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877120.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Station-St-1-2jpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>There is a row of shops in Station Street, leading up to its junction with Guild Street, including the restaurant Veneziaa, with an interesting-looking top end to it.</p>
          <p>The first floor over those shops used to be Burton's museum and art gallery, which was opened in the mid-19th century by the Burton Natural History Society.</p>
          <p>Collections on show included a series of British birds, geological materials and plants.</p>
          <p>It is not known when the museum closed, but it was still running in 1966, when members held wild flower demonstrations for National Nature Week.</p>
        </li>

          <h4>Burton Town Hall</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2893407.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-21-at-172934_resultjpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>A look up at the decorative triangle above the door to one of the main entrances in King Edward Place shows a coat of arms which holds a significant place in Burton's past.</p>
          <p>The Burton County Borough's coat of arms carries the words Honor Alit Artes - Latin which has been interpreted as meaning "Honour all the Arts", "Honour Work" or "Honour Honour".</p>
        </li>

          <h4>The Leopard Inn, Lichfield Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2893374.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-17-at-114347jpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>The facade on this amazing pub carries a cast-iron plaque with the historic symbol of the United Order of Smiths.</p>
          <p>It shows a lathe, a beam engine, a travelling smith passing a milestone and a buck-in-a-park - or deer-like creature.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>The Royal Oak</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877258.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-16-at-173449_resultjpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>The famous old pub in Market Place is in a building which goes back centuries - and historically is the site of many an old ghost story.</p>
          <p>A look up at the living quarters shows four ornate black cross-like symbols which look like they could possibly have gone all the way back to the building's roots in the English Civil War.</p>
          <p>It was reputed to have been the town lock-up, where police in the town would incarcerate wrongdoers.</p>
          <p>In Medieval times, it is thought an old oak tree in Market Place from which the pub derives its name was used to hang the most serious offenders.</p>

          <h4>TL Darby, in New Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877117.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_New-St-1-1jpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>A magnificent crest stands at the peak of this beautiful building, preserving its intriguing history.</p>
          <p>Some people do not know that the building was once Burton Fire Station, with the town left responsible for its own fire brigade until 1974, when it became part of Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service.</p>
          <p>The fire station was replaced by a new one in Moor Street in 1973 and car dealership TL Darby opened in 1979.</p>

          <h4>Langan's Tea Rooms</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877114.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_Guild-Street-1-2jpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Now a hugely popular business to which Burtonians flock on a daily basis, this amazing building, which has some beautiful Tudor features, was once Burton's Liberal Club.</p>
          <p>It was later renamed the George Street Club, but has had various business uses in more recent years.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Disused building in Guild Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877121.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_Guild-Street-2-2jpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>You may not have even noticed this tall, thin building in Guild Street, next to its junction with Station Street. but it has played a significant role in the history of Burton.</p>
          <p>A look up at the stonework near the roof shows a plaque reading "school board".</p>
          <p>As the name suggests, it was once the offices of the School Board and later of Burton Education Committee.</p>
          <p>Next door was Guild Street School, which closed as a school in the 1940s.</p>
          <p>Both the school and the old school board building were used by a carpet firm in recent years, and a wedding dress business has since moved in.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>The Dial, Station Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2893369.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-16-at-181402jpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Jewellers' Baileys once operated where the Dial is now and had a strong line in clock-making and maintenance.</p>
          <p>The clock that is attached to the wall of the popular restaurant dates back to the Baileys days - and was first put up in 1905.</p>
          <p>The popular jeweller closed in the 1990s and the Dial was formed from that building and a couple of neighbouring units, one of which was a pet shop.</p>
          <p>The Dial's name pays homage to the old clock-making business, which is one of Burton's best known 20th-century firms.</p>
        </li>

          <h4>Admiral Casino, High Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877259.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-16-at-173257_resultjpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Scores of Burtonians have headed in here to chance their arm on the slots.</p>
          <p>But before it was an arcade, it was home to one of Burton's first picture houses.</p>
          <p>Back when a trip to the pictures was the undoubted highlight of many people's weeks, the Electric Theatre was the place to be in the early decades of the 20th century.</p>
          <p>Across the road was the Black Cat Billiard Hall, where many revellers whiled the hours away potting balls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>The old Bass offices, High Street</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2877260.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-05-16-at-173020_resultjpeg.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Near Burton Library are the former offices of one of the town's most famous brewing firms.</p>
          <p>It is now thought to be used by Molson Coors, which currently brews the famous ale.</p>
          <p>Looking up at the offices through the black rail gates reveals the famous Bass triangle - which is Britain's oldest trademark, having been registered on January 1, 1876</p>
