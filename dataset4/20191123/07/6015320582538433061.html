      <p>Washington supports continued involvement of India in Afghanistan, a State Department official told reporters on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Nancy Izzo Jackson, a State Department official in charge of Afghanistan said “The United States welcomes India’s substantial investment in and assistance to Afghanistan.”</p>
      <p>Jackson further added “And we will continue to support efforts to achieve an honorable and enduring outcome in Afghanistan that preserves our investment in Afghanistan’s future.”</p>
      <p>India has played a major role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban regime and has invested over $2 billion in various reconstruction and infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p>The construction of the major Salma Dam, the new Afghan parliament building, Zaranj-Delaram highway, and some other projects are among the key investments India has done so far in the country.</p>
      <p>The government of India pledged a fresh aid package of $1 billion to support the reconstruction projects in Afghanistan during a visit by President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani in late 2016.</p>
