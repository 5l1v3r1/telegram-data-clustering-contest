      <p>Congratulating <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>on becoming the chief minister of Maharashtra once again, Union minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/prakash-javadekar">Prakash Javadekar </a>on Saturday said the Shiv Sena betrayed the people of the state by deciding to go with the Congress, which was "synonymous with corruption".</p>
      <p>He also said that despite the Congress being against the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Sena decided to join hands with it.</p>
      <p>Fadnavis took oath as the chief minister of Maharashtra and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar </a>of the NCP as his deputy on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The development raised eyebrows in the political circles as the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress were holding talks over the last few days to form a government in the state. NCP president <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>had even announced that Sena chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uddhav-thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray </a>was the three parties' consensus choice for the top post.</p>
      <p>"Congratulations to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>for becoming the CM of Maharashtra and he becoming the CM is the respect to the mandate given by people," Javadekar said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>He added that the "khichdi" (hotchpotch) being cooked (by the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) was against the people's mandate.</p>
      <p>"People had voted for BJP alliance. Shiv Sena betrayed people &amp; peoples' mandate &amp; decided to go with the Congress, which opposed Ram Mandir &amp; Veer Savarkar; Shiv Sena was happy to go with the Congress, which is synonymous to corruption &amp; had imposed emergency," he said in another tweet.</p>
      <p>"How absurd the argument of Shiv Sena is - If Shiv Sena goes with the NCP it is good and if NCP MLAs come with BJP it is bad. Today what has been honoured is "Peoples' Mandate," the minister said.</p>
