      <h2>The girls' devastated mother carried their bodies into the family home near Brisbane, Australia, in a desperate attempt to cool their bodies, it was reported</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:43:09+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:43</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Two sisters aged just one and two are dead after they were left inside a hot car as the outside temperature soared to 31C.</p>
      <p>The girls' devastated mum discovered them inside the vehicle and carried them into the family home in a desperate attempt to cool their bodies, according to witnesses.</p>
      <p>A neighbour said her granddaughters later saw the sisters' bodies being carried out of the home, near Brisbane, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/australia">Australia,</a> and they were "soaking wet".</p>
      <p>The inside of the car would have been like an oven - experts say the temperature inside a parked car on a warm day can be more than 30C hotter than that outside the car.</p>

      <p>Police and paramedics were called to the home in Logan at about 1.35pm local time on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The sisters were unresponsive when they were discovered and paramedics desperately tried to revive them.</p>
      <p>Police told <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/logan-children-dead-after-being-left-in-hot-car-brisbane-news/d120dba2-d9d2-43ec-97be-0a378e6320a7">9News</a> that the girls died after being left inside the car on a hot spring day.</p>
      <p>The sisters' mother found them and rushed them inside in an attempt to cool their bodies, the report added.</p>

      <p>A neighbour told the <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/crime-and-justice/police-investigate-after-two-children-found-dead-in-car-at-logan/news-story/d2da4d256151f91ef8bd902b014a2054">Courier Mail:</a> "My granddaughters saw the babies being carried out of the house soaking wet.</p>
      <p>"It is a tragic accident, she was a good mum."</p>
      <p>Describing the scene as "tragic" and "distressing", Detective Inspector Mark White said: "Two young children were located at that particular location.</p>
      <p>"QAs (paramedics) made attempts to revive those children, unfortunately they were both declared deceased at the scene.</p>
      <p>"The two children showed evidence of being exposed to extreme heat."</p>

      <p>Police have spoken to the girls' parents.</p>
      <p>No-one has been arrested.</p>
      <p>Officers cordoned off the home with crime scene tape and forensics officers were brought in to examine the car.</p>
      <p>The temperature inside a hot car can be more than 30C hotter than outside the car on a typical Australian summer day, said Australia's National Roads and Motorists' Association.</p>
      <p>Within minutes, a child left in a parked car in that kind of extreme heat can become dehydrated and can die from organ failure, it said.</p>
