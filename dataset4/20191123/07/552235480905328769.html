      <p>A popular Lanarkshire singing ensemble are preparing to take to the stage with their Christmas’ concert in aid of the Advertiser’s Toy Appeal.</p>
      <p>Octave have swapped their usual style of Broadway musicals, classical and popular music for a programme of festive favourites and carol singing.</p>
      <p>And for the third year running the group, who are entirely voluntary, have decided that all proceeds from this event will be donated to our Christmas Toy Appeal.</p>
      <p>The members of the group are Lananrkshire’s Janis Cunningham, John McKenzie, Esther O’Hara, Jonathan Procter, Kirsty Ross, Julie Thomson, Raymond Tulips and Carol Whitelaw.</p>
      <p>Octave were formed by renowned local Musical Director, David Fisher, in 2011 and have been performing at various charity and fundraising events ever since.</p>
      <p>In 2013, they were awarded ‘Best in Class’ in the Mixed Voice Choir section of the Glasgow Music Festival.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Octave told the Advertiser: “The group presented a Christmas concert for the first time in 2017 which went down very well with audiences and as a result we were able to send £1,700 to the Hamilton Advertiser Toy Appeal – hopefully this year’s will be as successful.”</p>
      <p>‘Octave at Christmas’ will be held on Saturday, December 7, at 7.30pm in Motherwell’s Dalziel St Andrew’s Church.</p>
      <p>Tickets, priced £10 (including refreshments), are available from Shona Fisher on 01698 721607 or by emailing shona.fisher2@mail.com.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with little over four weeks to go until Christmas day, here at the Advertiser we’re working our socks off to gather in as many gifts and toys as possible for disadvantaged children across South Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>Advertiser reporter Leona Greenan and Toy Appeal coordinator said: “It really is easy to get on board.</p>
      <p>“All you need to do is pick up a brand new toy or gift for a child aged from newborn to 18 the next time you’re out at the shops or doing a little online retail therapy from your own home.</p>
      <p>“Then just pop along to one of our many drop off points and help spread a little festive cheer this Christmas.”</p>
      <p>If you would like to help the appeal, you can hand in brand new toys, gifts or gift card donations to the Salvation Army Hall, Burnblea Street, Hamilton, with a donation.</p>
      <p>They will welcome you Monday to Friday between 10am and noon.</p>
      <p>Or pop your donations in to Starbucks Hamilton, Palace Grounds Retail Park, from 9am to 8pm or at Rocca, on Cadzow Street, Hamilton, between 9am and 9pm, seven days a week.</p>
      <p>Those in the Larkhall area can hand their gifts in to Happy Feet Nursery on Claude Street, Larkhall, from 9am to 6pm.</p>
      <p>You can also contact our reporter Leona Greenan, toy appeal co-ordinator, on 01698 205179 or by emailing leona.greenan@reachplc.com.</p>
