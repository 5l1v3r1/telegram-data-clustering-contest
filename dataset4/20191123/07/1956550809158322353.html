      <p>Not all of us will be lucky enough to get tickets to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but that doesn’t mean you can’t watch all the action as it unfolds. Loads of bars will be showing the races up on the big screens, and this isn’t just restricted to the venues found on Yas Island.<br/><br/>The whole city is set to embrace the excitement of Formula One Weekend so if you fancy watching the race in a spot that’s away from the crowds and madness of Yas Island, you have plenty of cool sports bars to choose from. Here are some of the best.</p>
      <p><b>Blu Sky Lounge &amp; Grill</b><br/>Themed around Premier League champions Manchester City, who are owned by the UAE capital, the bar here is literally encased by a football-shaped dome. But this modern bar isn’t just a place for football fans. The walls of the long venue are plastered with screens, so you’ll be able to watch all the action from the Grand Prix wherever you are sat. There are loads of great promotions going on throughout the week, too.<br/><i>Southern Sun Abu Dhabi, Al Mina Street, Al Zahiya (02 818 4888).</i></p>
      <p><b>Bridges Bar</b><br/>This up-market sports bar has a prime location at the Fairmont Bab Al Bahr hotel on the Grand Canal. But it doesn’t take itself too seriously, and the walls are covered with sports memorabilia and plenty of big screens where they will be showing all the racing action. It’s a popular place for a post-brunch blow out, and the food is decent if you’re in need of some good grub after all that partying.<br/><i>Fairmont Bab Al Bahr, Khor Al Maqta (02 654 3238).</i></p>

        <b>Cooper’s Bar &amp; Restaurant</b>

      <p>Cooper’s is an old fashioned British-style pub, which of course means there is almost always a game of football on one of the bar’s television screens. But during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula One will take centre stage, and while you’re watching you enjoy tasty bites like super cheesy quesadillas and burgers, and make the most of the long happy hours and frequent ladies’ nights.<br/><i>Park Rotana Abu Dhabi, Khalifa Park Area (02 657 3333).</i></p>
      <p><b>McGettigan’s</b><br/>Lively and spacious, McGettigan’s is one of the most popular pubs in Abu Dhabi, and with good reason. Drink deals keep the hops flowing, the food is some of the best pub grub in the city, and there’s plenty of sport on tap to keep patrons entertained. A dozen screens are placed all over the bar and there’s also a large main projector screen, so wherever you’re sitting you’ll always get a great view of the action throughout the whole weekend.<br/><i>Al Raha Beach Hotel &amp; Resort, Channel Street (02 652 4333).</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>NRG Sports Café</b>

      <p>NRG Sports Café has everything you’ll need to enjoy the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. There are plenty of large televisions screens both inside and outside, plus pool tables if you fancy a game with your mates after it’s all over. During the brilliant daily happy hour pints of hops start from a rather reasonable Dhs25 and once you check it out you’ll soon see why we named it our Best Sports Bar at the Time Out Abu Dhabi Music &amp; Nightlife Awards 2019.<br/><i>Le Méridien Abu Dhabi, Al Zahiyah (02 644 0348).</i></p>
      <p><b>The Sportsman’s Arms</b><br/>This cool gastropub is found in the International Tennis Centre at Zayed Sports City, and it has eight screens spread throughout the venue. This is a family-friendly venue with a wide wooden terrace which is perfect if you fancy soaking up some of the gorgeous Abu Dhabi sunshine. The barbecued meats and pizzas are worth your money, too.<br/><i>International Tennis Centre, Zayed Sports City (02 403 4235).</i></p>
