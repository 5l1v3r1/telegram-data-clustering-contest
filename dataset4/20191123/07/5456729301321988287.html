      <h1>FRSC dismisses 62 personnel for corruption - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:29:53+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/364738-frsc-dismisses-62-personnel-for-corruption.html" target="_blank">Oge Udegbunam</a></address>
      <p>The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said it dismissed 62 of its personnel in 2019.</p>
      <p>The FRSC corps marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, said this on Friday while speaking with reporters in Abuja on efforts to rid the corps of corruption.</p>
      <p>“These consist of 14 officers and 48 marshals with several others receiving various degrees of punishment in accordance with the provisions of the FRSC regulations on discipline,” he said</p>
      <p>He said the collaboration with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the State Security Service (SSS) has led to the investigation of 172 officials.</p>
      <p>“I wish to use this opportunity to urge members of the public not to hesitate to report any wrongdoing by the FRSC personnel for proper disciplinary actions, as the corps will not condone bribery and corruption from any of its personnel,” Mr Oyeyemi said.</p>
      <p>He said the agency will not condone bribery and corruption within its ranks.</p>
      <p>According to him, FRSC is the first government agency to collaborate with the Akin Fadeyi Foundation and MacArthur – both non-governmental organisations (NGOs) – for the launch of Flag-IT, an application developed for reporting corruption cases.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Easy Communication to Nigerians</b>
      </p>
      <p>The corps under the leadership of the present corps marshal established the first National Traffic Radio 107.3 FM, he said.</p>
      <p>“Apart from the cardinal role of sanitizing the public on the best road use culture, the station is to serve as a direct medium through which dissatisfied members of the public can call in to report complaints of service failures, extortion, bribery against members of the corps by aggrieved members of the public.”</p>
