      <p>Most of us have different passwords for various accounts and sometimes, it is tricky to keep track. This app is a password manager that lets you store passwords and also adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.

Multiple accounts can be added and you can access your information from any computer or phone without risking your information. (bit.ly/33ZJy8X)</p>
