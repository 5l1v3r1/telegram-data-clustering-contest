      <h1>Giuliani pal Lev Parnas may be peddling tale linking Devin Nunes to Ukraine</h1>

      <p>Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, discussed digging dirt on Joe Biden during a meeting in Vienna last year with a controversial former Ukrainian prosecutor, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/nunes-vienna-trip-ukrainian-prosecutor-biden/index.html">a CNN report is alleging</a> — citing as its source a lawyer for an indicted pal of Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>The lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, reps Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/10/businessmen-with-links-to-giulianis-ukraine-efforts-arrested-on-conspiracy-charges/">indicted last month on campaign-finance charges</a>.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Parnas learned from former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin that Nunes had met with Shokin in Vienna last December,” Bondy told the news site.</p>
      <p>Nunes was at the time, in late 2018, investigating the origins of the special counsel probe into Russian meddling.</p>
      <p>Such a meeting, if true, would raise conflict-of-interest alarms for Nunes, a staunch supporter of President Trump who has been his vocal defender during the<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/trump-impeachment-hearings-fiona-hill-and-david-holmes-testify-on-capitol-hill/"> Intelligence Committee impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>Parnas is willing to tell Congress that he put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians who could help the congressman dig up dirt on Biden and a theory that Ukraine meddled on Democrats’ behalf in the 2016 presidential election, CNN reported.</p>
      <p>The CNN report follows a similar story detailing a purported Parnas-Nunes link from Thursday, in the Daily Beast,</p>
      <p>Nunes, meanwhile, plans to sue both CNN and the Daily Beast for their “fake” recent hit pieces, he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/22/exclusive-devin-nunes-to-sue-cnn-daily-beast-over-fake-news-attacks/">told Breitbart News late Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>“They will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving,” Nunes told Breitbart.</p>
