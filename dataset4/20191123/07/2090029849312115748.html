      <p>Air Peace CEO Allen Onyema denied the more than $20 million fraud allegations leveled against him by the USAZ.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://lailasnews.com/airpeace-ceo-allen-onyema-bank-fraud-and-money-laundering/"> US Attorneys office in Georgia charged the </a><a href="https://lailasnews.com/airpeace-ceo-allen-onyema-bank-fraud-and-money-laundering/">Chairman, CEO, and founder of Air Peace, Allen Onyema</a>, for his alleged involvement in a bank fraud and money laundering where more than $20 million was moved from Nigeria through United States bank accounts. They claim he did this in a scheme allegedly involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.</p>

      <p>Allen Onyema has responded saying the allegations are false and are in no way in line with his character as a person and as a business man whose only aim has been to build Nigeria and improve wellbeing.</p>
      <blockquote>“As the press statement clearly stated, these are indictment that only contains charges. I am innocent of all charges and the US government will find no dirt on me because I have never conducted business with any illegalities.<br/><br/>“Be rest assured that I also have my lawyers on this and these mere allegations will be refuted. I never laundered money in my life, neither have I committed bank fraud anywhere in the world. Every Kobo I transferred to the US for aircraft purchase went through the Central Bank of Nigeria LC regime and all were used for the same purpose.<br/><br/>“The American companies that received the funds are still in business. I never took a penny from any US bank or Nigerian bank. I am willing to defend my innocence in the US courts,” Onyema stated.</blockquote>
