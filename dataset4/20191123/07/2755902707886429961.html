      <p>Early this morning, <a href="https://iharare.com/vp-chiwenga-back-in-zim-welcomed-by-chinese-ambassador/">Vice President Constantino Chiwenga was welcomed back home</a> following a long medical leave. The Vice President had been in China where he was being treated following reports that <a href="https://iharare.com/fresh-details-emerge-on-ailing-vice-presiden/">he was allegedly poisoned</a> although it is not quite clear who may have committed the dastardly deed. <a href="https://twitter.com/ZimpapersI">State-owned media</a> reported that the Vice President was being treated for an undisclosed ailment.</p>
      <p>The Vice President was welcomed by officials from the Chinese Embassy as well as his older brother Onismo and son Tawanda. However, curiously, his wife Mary appeared no to be at the Airport.  There have been reports that <a href="https://iharare.com/vp-chiwenga-bans-wife-marry/">Chiwenga banned his wife from visiting him because he was paranoid that she was being used to spy on him</a>.</p>
      <p>Here is the video of the return of the Vice President.</p>
