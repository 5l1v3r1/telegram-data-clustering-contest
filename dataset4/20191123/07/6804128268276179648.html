      <h1>Hudson-Odoi, Pulisic, Loftus-Cheek - Latest Chelsea injury news and ahead of Manchester City</h1>
      <h2>The latest injury news for Chelsea as they travel to face champions Manchester City after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:50:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:50</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Harbord, Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>The Premier League is back after the international break.</p>
      <p>Chelsea play in arguably the game of the weekend, as they travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on reigning Champions Manchester City this afternoon (Saturday).</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's men are in third position in the table and are on a brilliant run of form that has put them one place and one point ahead of their opponents going into the match.</p>
      <p>The Blues will be looking to make a statement to the rest of the league and win their seventh Premier League match in a row by taking all three points back to Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>But, to have the best chance of doing that, Lampard will need as many players as possible available.</p>
      <p>So, here's a look at the latest news from the Cobham treatment room:</p>
      <h3>Christian Pulisic</h3>
      <p>Chelsea have faced an anxious wait over the international break to discover the extent of Pulisic's hip injury that kept him out of international duty.</p>
      <p>However, head coach Frank Lampard has delivered news that will be music to Blues fans' ears.</p>
      <p>"He had a problem going into the last game against Palace, hence why he came off after his goal," he said in his pre-match press conference ahead of the trip to Man City.</p>

      <p>"He missed the two games, has started to train again this week so he's in contention to play."</p>
      <p>The news will be a major boost to Chelsea ahead of a massive game as he has been in fine form for the Blues in recent weeks, with his goal against Crystal Palace on Saturday his fifth of the season.</p>
      <h3>Callum Hudson-Odoi</h3>
      <p>While there is good news on Pulisic, one player who may not be available for Lampard is Callum Hudson-Odoi. The midfielder was substituted in the second half of England's game against Kosovo last Sunday, but there was no reported injury at the time.</p>
      <p>However, Lampard has confirmed that the England man may not be in contention to face Man City due to a problem with his hamstring.</p>
      <p>"Callum Hudson-Odoi is probably the one who has a hamstring issue that he picked up in the England game he will struggle to be in contention for this game, but it's short term," said the Chelsea boss.</p>

      <h3>Antonio Rudiger</h3>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger had appeared to have given Frank Lampard a welcome injury boost by declaring himself fit for the Blues' recent trip to Watford.</p>
      <p>The German centre back underwent knee surgery in the summer and has missed a good majority of the season, but won't be available until at least after the international break following an operation at the beginning of the week.</p>
      <p>"He had an operation and he is going to be out probably for three weeks, hopefully,"<a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/lampard-chelsea-press-conference-live-17218718">Lampard confirmed at his pre-Crystal Palace press conference</a>. "Then we will have to see where match fitness comes in because he has been out for a long time now.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"It was nice to get something definitive about it because we have been trying to find a solution and he has been having some issues. It is not easy for a player in that position. So hopefully we are at that stage and hopefully in three weeks time we are in a lot better place."</p>
      <p>Rudiger is not likely to face Manchester City, but could be available for selection next month.</p>
      <h3>Ross Barkley</h3>
      <p>Barkley has not featured since the 1-0 win against Newcastle United last month.</p>
      <p>He has been missing since after picking up an ankle injury in the victory, with Lampard confirming that Barkley wouldn't be fit enough to make the squad for the visit of Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The England international was initially called up to Gareth Southgate's squad for the international fixtures against Montenegro and Kosovo over the international break.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But, the midfielder was forced to pull out of the Three Lions squad prior to the first of two matches, due to the injury.</p>
      <p>That means that Barkley remains a doubt for the City clash, although Premier Injuries rate his chance of being fit for the match at 25%.</p>

      <h3>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</h3>
      <p>Loftus-Cheek was establishing himself as a key member of Maurizio Sarri's squad at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>However, in the post-season friendly ahead of the Europa League final, Loftus-Cheek suffered the same injury as Hudson-Odoi as he ruptured his Achilles' tendon.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is still undergoing rehabilitation, with Loftus-Cheek working towards a return as soon as possible.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"It’s going well!" he recently told <a href="https://versus.uk.com/2019/11/im-coming-back-stronger-ruben-loftus-cheek-ready-return-already-eyes-euro-2020/">Versus</a> when asked about his recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a long time and I’ve had a few setbacks as well. It’s never been just a straight path but I’m close now…I’ve been running and moving, I feel I’m right on the edge. I’m close and I can’t wait."</p>
      <p>However, Lampard has <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/rudiger-loftus-cheek-chelsea-injuries-17225279">warned it could still be a while yet before the midfielder</a> is available for selection.</p>
      <p>A conditional return date of mid December has been suggested by PremierInjuries, with a possible return coming in the Premier League clash against Bournemouth, however, Lampard has confirmed that there is no set date for the player's return.</p>

      <h3>Marco van Ginkel</h3>
      <p>The midfielder is a long term absentee, as he continues his rehabilitation following an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman is on the way to recovery, having posted a video of himself working on the anti-gravity treadmill at the club's training ground.</p>

      <p>However, there is no return date provided for the 26-year-old as yet.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea should welcome back <b>Jorginho</b> after the international break, with the midfielder available for selection again after serving a one-match suspension and in fine form for Italy, scoring and creating another in a 9-1 win against Armenia.</p>
      <p><b>N'Golo Kante</b> has had his injury problems of late, but the Frenchman started for Didier Deschamps' side against Moldova on Thursday, and was an unused substitute against Albania on Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>Emerson </b>was not in the squad for Italy's second match of the international squad, however there doesn't seem to be much concern over an injury for the Italian.</p>
