      <h1>Why China's Navy Is Not to Be Underestimated</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">James Holmes</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> Pride comes before the fall, so America must not dismiss its potential enemies.</p>
      <p>Admirals say the darnedest things. Over at the U.S. Naval Institute’s <i>Proceedings </i>magazine, retired U.S. Pacific Command Intelligence Chief <a href="http://navintpro.org/news/2016/05/05/tonight!-live-remarks-on-the-prc-navy-by-capt-jim-fanell,-usn,-ret/">Capt. Jim Fanell</a> takes PACOM kahunas, past and present, <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-05/r-e-s-p-e-c-t-pla-navy">to task</a> for disparaging China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). Respect for prospective foes, proclaims Captain Fanell, constitutes the most prudent attitude.</p>
      <p>Such counsel is evergreen.</p>
      <p>Military folk must beware of hubris, the worst of all strategic habits. As ancient Greeks warned, hubris begets nemesis, meaning divine retribution. It’s insidious—especially for a force like the U.S. Navy. After all, it’s been twenty-six years since the Cold War. Few sailors or naval aviators now in uniform have known anything except American maritime supremacy. Such a historical interlude can give rise to triumphalism that taints assessments of rising challengers.</p>
      <p>Last month, for instance, erstwhile PACOM commander Adm. Dennis Blair <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/articles/former-pacom-commander-can-it-with-the-china-pessimism">told</a> a naval conference that China’s military has failed to amass “maritime and air superiority” and thus cannot degrade American deterrence or treaty commitments in the Far East. Around the same time, testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, current PACOM supremo, Adm. Harry Harris, <a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN3_20170426_140100_Admiral_Harry_Harris_Says_U.S._Must_Remain_a_Credible_Deterrent_to_North...">likened</a> comparing PLAN and U.S. Navy submarines to “comparing a Model T with a Corvette.”</p>
      <p>The impression conveyed in both instances: nothing to worry about here, move along.</p>
