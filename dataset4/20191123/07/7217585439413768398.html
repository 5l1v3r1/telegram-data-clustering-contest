      <h1>SAWS confirms a tornado struck Utrecht, KwaZulu-Natal on Friday night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:57:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:57</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>Another tornado on Friday struck the KwaZulu-Natal town of Utrecht, the South African Weather Service (SAWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic/status/1198004043223834630">confirmed</a>.</p>
      <p>In two statements posted to Twitter, the service noted that the weather phenomenon occurred on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>SAWS <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic/status/1198159745967968256">explained</a> that the tornado spawned from a “severe storm” that developed between Newcastle and Dundee. While it weakened as it changed course and moved towards Utrecht, it strengthened once again.</p>
      <p>“Spectific radar signatures suggested that tornadic activity was present,” SAWS added.</p>
      <p>It also posted images from <a href="https://newcastleadvertiser.co.za/183457/gallery-devastation-utrechts-reported-tornado-pictures/">local publication Newcastle Advertiser</a> showing destruction to property.</p>
      <p><a href="https://newcastleadvertiser.co.za/183451/just-reported-tornado-rips-utrecht-area/">According to the Advertiser</a>, “barbed wire, branches, trees and more” are scattered across the town. The images also depict damaged cars and houses.</p>

      <p>The Utrecht tornado comes just weeks after tornadoes struck other areas near New Hanover <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic/status/1194940527373893632">and Bergville</a>, KwaZulu-Natal.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, SAWS issued a release regarding phenomena that many believed were tornadoes, seen near Bapsfontein, Gauteng and Delmas, Mpumalanga.</p>
      <p>It confirmed that <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/bapsfontein-tornadoes-gustnadoes/">these were merely “gustnadoes”</a>, a type of dust devil-like whirlwind.</p>
