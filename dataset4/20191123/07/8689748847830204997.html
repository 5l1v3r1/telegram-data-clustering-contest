      <p>After watching the trailer myself some weeks back, I was convinced this is a beautiful movie that could earn an international recognition.</p>
      <p>The concept, dialogue and costume which was set in the past (during the time Ghana was called Gold Coast) is so on point.</p>
      <p>The movie will be premiered on January 3, 2020 at Silverbird Cinemas, Accra Mall and January 4, 2020 at Silverbird Cinemas, West Hills Mall.</p>
