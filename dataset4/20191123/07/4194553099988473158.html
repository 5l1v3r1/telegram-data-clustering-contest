      <h1>(Video) Liverpoolâ€™s potential Club World Cup opponents Flamengo have a song about the Reds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:24:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool, as champions of Europe, will compete in the FIFA Club World Cup next month, and they could be joined by Brazilian side Flamengo.</p>
      <p>Another team who will be present will be selected via the Copa Libertadores final, which takes place this evening and is between Flamengo and River Plate. The winner of that will join the Reds in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>For those in the UK, the Copa Libertadores showpiece game can be watched on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50503501">BBC Two</a> this evening from 19:45.</p>
      <p>If Flamengo do progress to the tournament, the Reds will need no added motivation to win a possible clash in Qatar, given no Liverpool side has won it before, but as the video below shows, revenge is necessary.</p>
      <p>As Twitter user @Brand0nLFC points out, the Reds were beaten by Flamengo in the competition back in 1981, and the Brazilians still sing about it even now.</p>
      <blockquote>Turns out Flamengo have a song about beating us in the Club World Cup Final in 1981, revenge is needed as much as I respect Flamengo. ðŸ”´ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Liverpool?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Liverpool</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Flamengo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Flamengo</a> <a href="https://t.co/Of0T9uS2BA">pic.twitter.com/Of0T9uS2BA<br/></a>â€” Brandon.

      <p>The Redsâ€™ first game of the Club World Cup will be on December 18, just a day after the Carabao Cup quarter-final clash against Aston Villa, with a potential final three days later.</p>
