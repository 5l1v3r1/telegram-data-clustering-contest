      <p>A car burst into flames on a quiet Brooklyn street Friday night, rattling nearby buildings and concerning residents.</p>
      <p>The car, parked on Carroll Street between Smith and Court in Carroll Gardens, erupted just before 11:30 p.m., authorities said.</p>
      <p>Firefighters responded after witnesses called 911; they quickly extinguished the blaze, cops said.</p>
      <p>David Friedman was watching TV with his girlfriend in his fifth-floor apartment when he felt his building shake from the blast, he said.</p>
      <p>“We ran to the window and saw a car on fire, but not super large,” he said in a message Friday.</p>
      <p>“Then the car really caught on fire. Flames were about 20 feet. Trees almost caught,” he added.</p>
      <p>Police were also investigating the fire, but it’s not believed to be an arson, authorities said.</p>
