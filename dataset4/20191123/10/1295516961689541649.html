      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-adam-film/">Black Adam</a> producer Hiram Garcia is hoping Henry Cavill will reprise his role as Superman for Warner Bros.' upcoming comic book caper starring <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-adam-dc-movie-rock-release-delays-reason/">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://comicbook.com/2019/11/21/black-adam-producer-possibility-of-henry-cavill-superman/">ComicBook.com</a>, Garcia discussed Cavill's potential involvement, saying, "I think the DC Universe is a wonderful universe and we're open to everything. We have big aspirations for it. We're friends with Henry. [Dwayne] and Henry are friends, it's a huge comic book brand as well. And I always just loved the idea. Who knows? But man, Black Adam for Superman is really cool. That'd be really powerful."</p>

      <p>Following the box office disappointment of Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon's <i>Justice League</i>, the well-laid plans for the DCEU started to fall apart. Ben Affleck later stepped down as Batman, and Cavill has not since reprised his role, seemingly moving on to a new franchise in <i>The Witcher</i>. Cavill was also rumored to cameo, but was unavailable for filming. Instead, the movie featured <a href="https://www.cbr.com/shazam-movie-superman-cameo-much-better/">a Cavill-inspired version of the character</a> that was only shot from the neck down. That being said, Cavill recently said he's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/henry-cavill-not-ready-stop-playing-superman/">not ready to stop playing the Metropolis Marvel</a>.</p>
      <p>Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, <i>Black Adam</i> stars Dwayne Johnson. The film is scheduled to arrive in theaters Dec. 22, 2021. Production is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/black-adam-production-start-date-dwayne-johnson/">expected to kick off</a> in July.</p>
