The Labour leader was at an Amazon depot in Yorkshire this morning where he vowed to tackle the “tax and wage cheat culture” of multinational companies who “rip off” workers. Mr Corbyn gave crowds “thumbs up” as he held up a banner with his supporters. The Labour manifesto revealed that under his government corporations will be made to pay a 26 per cent duty.</li>

He said: “I met Evo Morales in Mexico last year. “I had a long conversation with him about his country, economic development and the number of people taken out of poverty.”</li>

He told him: “I don’t buy this nice old grandpa… I see that video and that tells me all I need to know and that terrifies me for my daughters.”</li>
