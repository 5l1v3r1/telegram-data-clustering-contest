      <p>The actors co-starred in the famous 'Saturday Night Live' sketch nearly 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>Will Ferrell says Christopher Walken is still mad about his involvement in one of the most famous sketches in <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/saturday-night-live/">Saturday Night Live</a></i> history. During an appearance on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>, Ferrell revealed that the Oscar-winning actor once called him out over the classic “More Cowbell” sketch they co-starred in back in 2000.</p>
      <p>In the famous sketch, Walken plays Blue Oyster Cult producer Bruce Dickinson, while Ferrell sports a tight-fitting, belly-baring shirt to play fictional band member Gene Frenkle in a faux documentary about the band. Former <i>SNL</i> players Chris Kattan, Chris Parnell, Horatio Sanz, and Jimmy Fallon also portray Blue Oyster Cult bandmates in the sketch.</p>
      <p>As the band begins to record their 1976 radio hit “(Don’t Fear) the Reaper” at Sunshine Studios, Walken’s character demands that they up the use of “cowbell.” The cowbell sound becomes a running gag in the lengthy sketch as Ferrell’s character annoys his bandmates with the unlikely instrument while following Walken’s instructions to give him more of it.</p>
      <p>“I gotta have more cowbell,” Walken says at one point. ” I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell.”</p>
      <p>Fallon, meanwhile, can be seen visibly losing it over the sketch as he tries to cover his laughter up by putting drumsticks in front of his face.</p>
      <p>On <i>The Tonight Show</i>, Ferrell told Fallon (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8kIzOr6DP8">YouTube</a>) that years after he co-starred with Walken in the famous parody of the ’70s rock band, he stopped by to see the actor backstage at a theater performance. That’s where Walken laid a guilt trip on him.</p>
      <p>Ferrell said Walken told him, “You know, you’ve ruined my life.”</p>
      <p>“People during the curtain call bring cowbells and ring them. The other day I went for an Italian food lunch and the waiter asked if I wanted more cowbell with my pasta Bolognese,” he quoted the actor as saying.</p>
      <p>Ferrell went on to say he thinks Walken was “really mad” at him over the now-classic sketch. The <i>SNL</i> funnyman pointed out that the movie icon had such a great career before “More Cowbell,” yet the <i>SNL</i> sketch is what he is often associated with.</p>
      <p>“From ‘The Deer Hunter’ to ‘Pulp Fiction’ to ‘More Cowbell.’ That’s all he gets,” Ferrell said.</p>
      <p>Ferrell and Fallon agreed that the famous sketch made so many people happy and only “ruined” one person’s life: Walken’s.</p>

      <p>In a 2016 interview with <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/christopher-walken-talks-career-and-that-more-cowbell-sketch-2-222844/">Rolling Stone</a></i>, Walken addressed his role in the “More Cowbell” sketch and hinted that it still follows him two decades later.</p>
      <p>“I knew it was funny,” Walken said. “Yeah. Will Ferrell was hilarious. But it has stuck, I must say.”</p>
      <p>Luckily, Will Ferrell has no bitter feelings about his days on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. The 52-year-old comedian <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5740426/will-ferrell-snl/">will host</a> this week’s episode of the NBC late-night show and will even earn the coveted Five-Timers status for the guest hosting gig.</p>
