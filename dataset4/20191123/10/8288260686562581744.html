      <p>A blackened princess castle sits in the darkness of a smoke-damaged room following a devastating flat fire in the city.</p>
      <p>It is the heartbreaking image which captures the stark aftermath of a tower block blaze on Friday afternoon (November 22).</p>
      <p>Fortunately no one was injured as flames tore through a 12th floor flat off Priory Road in Edgbaston.</p>
      <p>But pictures shared by West Midlands Fire Service show the destruction of a child's bedroom, the kitchen and the hallway.</p>

      <p>Several panicked residents raised the alarm with the fire service - with thirty firefighters then racing to the scene around 12.30pm.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the six crews managed to get the blaze under control before it affected other floors.</p>
      <p>Ladywood Watch Commander, Mike Long, shared images of the incident and said: "Flat fire on the 12th floor of a block of flats in Edgbaston, quickly under control thanks to rapid intervention of crews today.</p>
      <p>"Note the added danger of fallen cables."</p>

      <p>It is not known what sparked the inferno.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for West Midlands Fire Service added: "We had the call at 12.30pm to the 12th floor of a block of flats just off Priory Road.</p>
      <p>"We had six appliances attending. We had quite a lot of repeat calls about this one. Not believed to be any injuries.</p>
      <p>"We came away at 3.45pm."</p>
