      <h1>FTB: The return of Tyson Barrie</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/295109/tyson-barrie">Tyson Barrie</a> scored his first goal as a Maple Leaf in Thursday’s game against the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/arizona-coyotes">Coyotes</a>. It was a big moment for a player who arrived here as an alleged high-octane offensive defenceman that would provide an immediate boost to scoring, especially on the power play because that had not actually happened.</p>
      <p>Barrie didn’t score any goals at all in the first 23 games of the season. Then Sheldon Keefe replaced Mike Babcock as head coach and, boom, there it was. He scores. The timing evoked an almost <i>deus ex machina</i> element to the story through Keefe arriving as the head coach.</p>
      <p>A prologue to that story could be Barrie scoring again tonight against his old team, the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/colorado-avalanche">Avalanche</a>. The Avalanche, of course, have a long time Leafs fan favourite on their roster now in <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/297312/nazem-kadri">Nazem Kadri</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s going to be a night of very mixed emotions.</p>
      <p>We will have a preview of tonight’s game later this afternoon. One Leafs lineup change has already been confirmed.</p>

      <p>The Marlies are playing the Manitoba Moose <i>(</i><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/winnipeg-jets"><i>Winnipeg Jets</i></a><i> affiliates)</i> this weekend in back-to-back games. The first is this afternoon at 4:00 p.m.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>We’re also watching to see if there’s news about a lineup change on Coaches Corner tonight. I think it’s unlikely Rogers has yet to figure that all out, especially because advertising contracts will likely have to be ripped up and/or rewritten. We shall see by 7:00 p.m. tonight at the latest.</p>
