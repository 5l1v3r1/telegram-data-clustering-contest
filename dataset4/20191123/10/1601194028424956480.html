      <p>The first match of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/t10-cricket-league">T10 League 2019</a> playoffs will feature a battle between the table-toppers <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/maratha-arabians">Maratha Arabians</a> and Dawid Malan's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/qalandars-cricket">Qalandars</a>. Both the sides had performed extremely well in the league and have earned themselves two opportunities to make it to the grand finale.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This match will start at 5 PM IST and the winner will book their ticket for tomorrow's final. The loser, however, will have to take part in the Eliminator 2 scheduled to take place later tonight and a victory in that game can do the job for them.</p>

      <p>Shifting our focus to the star players who will be in action in Qualifier 1, Yuvraj Singh will be the centre of attraction as he had played a whirlwind knock of 23 runs yesterday to drive the Arabians home. Captain Chris Lynn will have to provide a head-start to the Maratha innings while Lasith Malinga and Dwayne Bravo will have the onus of picking the wickets.</p>
      <p>From the Qalandars, Tom Banton can prove to be the X-factor if he is cleared to play for them. In his absence, skipper Dawid Malan and wicket-keeper batsman Tom Kohler-Cadmore will have to shoulder the responsibilities of the batting department. Afghanistan's young spinner, Mujeeb Ur Rahman will lead the team's bowling attack.</p>
