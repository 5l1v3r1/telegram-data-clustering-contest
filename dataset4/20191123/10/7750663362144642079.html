      <h1>Xherdan Shaqiri 'given assurances over Liverpool future'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> has suggested that he expects <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/xherdan-shaqiri/"><b>Xherdan Shaqiri</b></a> to feature in his squad during the upcoming months.</h2>

      <p>As a result of the form of his teammates and injury, Shaqiri has been limited to just three substitute outings in the Premier League and Champions League this season.</p>
      <p>However, after recovering from a calf injury, the Switzerland international has been tipped to make regular outings during a hectic period for the Merseyside giants.</p>
      <p>At a press conference, Klopp told reporters: "He has been really long injured, I think five weeks, so to get the match fitness again that takes time.</p>
      <p>"He trained this week and we gave him some different things to do but that's it, apart from that he should be completely fine."</p>
      <p>"There is no reason to rush it but it's nice to have him back. We saw a lot of really nice things in training this week but it is intense for him and he needs to get used to the intensity again and everything will be fine."</p>
      <p>Shaqiri will hope to feature on the bench when Liverpool face Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.</p>
