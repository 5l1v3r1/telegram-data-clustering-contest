      <h1>Leicester City's Ricardo Pereira: 'Premier League has missed Jose Mourinho'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leicester-city/"><b>Leicester City</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ricardo-pereira/"><b>Ricardo Pereira</b></a> has claimed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>'s arrival at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> is a positive development for the Premier League.</h2>

      <p>Earlier this week, Spurs parted ways with long-serving boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> before swiftly replacing the Argentine with former Chelsea and Manchester United manager Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Pereira, who has previously been linked with a switch to Spurs, has suggested that the 56-year-old's return to the dugout is a boost to both English and Portuguese football.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Record</i>, Pereira said: "He's been missed. He's one of the best coaches in the world.</p>
      <p>"It's always good for us Portuguese people to get back to work here in England. He's one of the big names in Portuguese football. He'll be able to show his value again, he'll be back in the spotlight. It's more of a challenge for him.</p>
      <p>"The league is very balanced. The points difference between 14th and 5th place is quite short."</p>
      <p>Should Spurs make an approach for Pereira in January, Leicester are highly likely to reject the bid.</p>
