      <p>The talks have resulted in a “new pay and conditions proposal” being agreed, Balpa said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“We can confirm that BALPA, BA and ACAS have put together a new pay and conditions proposal and, subject to final checks, BALPA expects it will shortly be consulting its 4,000 BA members on them,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>A British Airways spokeswoman said: “We welcome this positive step.” </p>
      <p>BA has agreed to insert an inflation protection clause to its previous pay offer of an 11.5% rise over three years as part of the deal, according to the Financial Times.</p>
      <p>The airline has also reportedly offered improvements to working conditions, rostering and flight bonuses.</p>
