      <h1>Tories in major blunder as they announce manifesto launch with wrong date</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> was left red-faced today after announcing the launch of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a>’s 2019 manifesto – but getting the date wrong.</p>
      <p>The Tories took to Twitter this morning to inform followers that their long-awaited manifesto would finally be landing on November 24.</p>
      <p>However, in the picture that accompanied their post, they wrote that the manifesto would be coming today, November 23.</p>
      <p>Clearly not realising the mistake, Boris Johnson retweeted the post, reminding his followers to ‘Vote Conservative’.</p>
      <p>However, both posts were hastily deleted minutes later.</p>
      <p>The Tories likely hoped that no one would have noticed their blunder.</p>

      <p>However, it was too late to hide it and people in the comment section soon clocked on.</p>
      <p>Twitter user @Remain4U wrote: ‘Is it today or tomorrow?! You just deleted a tweet saying it was launching today?! #Weakandwobbly #GetBrexitGone’.</p>

      <p>Another person with the Twitter handle @SectionY2018 found the situation amusing, writing: ‘Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Quick delete and get the date right’.</p>
      <p>@milkywaykks also took a swipe at the Conservatives putting ‘How can we trust a government who can’t even get the date right?!’ while @DrDublin1 added: ‘We all saw you lie again about the date.’</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted the Conservative Party for comment.</p>
      <p>The Tories are the last of the major parties to unveil their manifesto, with the Lib Dems doing so on Wednesday and Labour on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The arrival date had been hotly debated and there had been speculation that the party would unveil individual policies at regular intervals throughout their campaign to maximise media coverage.</p>

      <p>Although their full manifesto is still yet to come, the Tories have said they plan to ‘get Brexit done’ which will allow them to invest in public services.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has stated that the Conservatives will recruit 6,000 extra GPs and deliver 50 million more appointments a year by 2024-25 as part of a £33.9 billion boost for the health budget.</p>
      <p>The prime minister also wants to recruit 20,000 new police officers and increase stop-and-search powers in a bid to tackle rising knife crime.</p>
      <p>The manifesto is likely to include promises to cut taxes for ‘working people’ by raising the threshold for national insurance contributions to £12,000 and to deliver ‘at least’ one million homes in the next five years.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives have also pledged to cut business tax by 50% for smaller businesses, to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 and to cut net migration.</p>
