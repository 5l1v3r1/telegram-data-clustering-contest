      <p>LUANG PRABANG — Thailand’s central bank said on Saturday it would ease rules governing the foreign exchange market and international reserves, giving it more scope to tackle the baht’s strength following a series of rate cuts.</p>
      <p>“The policy rate is low when compared with the region … will not be able to lower rates much further,” Bank of Thailand Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob told reporters, adding that negative interest rates would lead to structural problems.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month the central bank lowered its one-day repurchase rates to 1.25%, the lowest level since the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The baht is Asia’s best-performing currency this year, rising 7.7% against the dollar, and putting further pressure on exporters already affected by global trade tensions.</p>
      <p>Veerathai said the central bank would review foreign exchange laws to allow greater flexibility, and to align regulations with new technological developments including digital currencies.</p>
      <p>Outlining the monetary authority’s 2020-2022 strategy, Veerathai said exchange rate volatility was unavoidable because it is closely tied to unpredictable external factors.</p>
      <p>He added that the central bank would look at how to relax foreign reserve measures and let Thai businesses keep currencies abroad because the country already had sufficient international buffers.</p>
      <p>Mathee Supapongse, deputy governor for monetary stability, said the central bank was also studying policies that could be deployed through non-financial institutions to directly impact the market. He did not give further details. (Reporting by Kitiphong Thaichareon Writing by Chayut Setboonsarng Editing by Helen Popper)</p>
