      <h1>Gogglebox viewers in hysterics as Dave the dog steals the show</h1>
      <h2>The Malones' mutt was rather taken by an episode of Mountain Vets</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:57:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author">Natasha Rigler</a></address>
      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/">Gogglebox</a> have concluded that Dave the dog is "the real star" after he got very enthusiastic watching a clip from Mountain Vets during last night's episode of the Channel 4 show.</p>
      <p>The Malone family were watching the documentary series with their Rottweiler when the on-screen vet explained how he was going to artificially inseminate a dog that "wanted puppies".</p>

      <p>But while Tom, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/goggleboxs-julie-malone-weight-loss/">Julie</a>, Tom Jnr and Shaun watched open-mouthed as he collected a sample of semen from a male dog, Dave got right up close to the telly screen.</p>
      <p>He then raced back and laid on Tom's lap, with his legs in the air.</p>
      <aside>Dave says can we get the address of that vets?!</aside>
      <p>Tom laughed: "Dave says can we get the address of that vets?! He likes the look of it!"</p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter, one fan mused: "Dave was very invested in that dog scene on Mountain Vets #Gogglebox #GoggleboxFriday."</p>

      <p>Another tweeted: "Mountain Vets, a bulldog having a happy ending and Dave the Rottweiler being engrossed watching it. I am crying #gogglebox #GoggleboxFriday."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Dave the dog's reaction to watching Mountain Vets has to be the best #gogglebox clip ever ..."</p>

      <p>One viewer even concluded: "Dave the dog stole the show tonight #Gogglebox."</p>
      <p>Dave is one of several dogs that have lived with the Malones that viewers have come to love - but sadly, not all of them are still with us.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, fans also found themselves gushing about Dave on social media <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/gogglebox-viewers-in-stitches-as-confused-malone-family-dog-goes-wild/">after he went wild during another episode of Gogglebox</a>.</p>
      <p>Tom had put on a dog mask for a spot of fun - and Dave just couldn't contain his excitement!</p>
