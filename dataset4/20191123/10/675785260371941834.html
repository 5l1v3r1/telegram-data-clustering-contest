      <p>At about 2am this morning, he hit his head and ran into bushland, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/disoriented-lost-in-the-bush-british-camper-missing-near-twelve-apostles-20191123-p53dea.html">the Age reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Friends he was camping with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/missing-persons">launched a search</a> for Mr King but were unable to find him, as officers warned that he may be disorientated and lost in the bush.</p>

      <p>Mr King "suddenly got up and ran from the area into surrounding bushland" in the early hours of Saturday morning, a police spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The police spokeswoman added: "Itâ€™s believed Aslan may be disoriented and become lost in the bush."</p>
      <p>Mr King's friends, who are also British, told Australia's Nine News that they had been drinking before he appeared to suffer a seizure.</p>
