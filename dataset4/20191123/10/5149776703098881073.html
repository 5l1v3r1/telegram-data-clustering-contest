      <p>The residents of the 19 homes evacuated after a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">mudslide</a> in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a> have been allowed to return home as work continues to find a long-term solution to stabilise the cliff-face behind their homes.</p>
      <p>The 60 people who live in Bank End Close and Stone Bank in Berry Hill Quarry were evacuated when <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/mansfield-mudslide-triggered-torrential-rain-3517304">1,300 tons of sand and rock fell down the cliff-face on November 7</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, many have been living with family and friends, or in temporary accommodation provided by Mansfield District Council.</p>
      <p>The council said it now aims to have a permanent plan in place by Christmas.</p>
      <p>Residents were allowed to return to their homes at 1pm on Friday, November 22 and were greeted with a parcel of essential food items provided by the local One Stop convenience store.</p>

      <p>Laura Allen, 37-year-old shift manager at the One Stop in Madeline Court, said: "We generally try to help where and when we can with things like this in the community. The manager and another member of staff put the hampers together.</p>
      <p>"It's a very tight-knit community down here and so people try to help one another like this. They all use our store frequently and the it was a lot quieter while they've all been away."</p>
      <p>The food parcels were made up of essentials including tea, sugar, milk, biscuits and mince pies.</p>
      <p>Laura added: "We really feel for them but are just glad they are home for Christmas."</p>

      <p>A 90-minute meeting took place on Wednesday, November 20 at the Civic Centre in Mansfield were residents were told they could return home and given information about what steps will be taken to stabilise the cliff and ensure against any future risks.</p>
      <p>Also at the meeting was Paul McMillan, a geotechnical expert with the council's specialist contractor - Fairhurst - who previously <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/council-says-mudslide-mansfield-completely-3541579#">told Nottinghamshire Live the mudslide was "completely unforeseen."</a></p>
      <p>Mike Robinson, Strategic Director of the council, said: “The residents were understandably concerned about the future but they were also extremely grateful for all the help and support they have been receiving from the council's emergency response team since this incident.</p>
      <p>“The land slip was an unforeseen event that was caused by extreme climatic conditions. Our main aim now is to stabilise the cliff to safeguard people’s properties and mitigate against any future risk of land slips.</p>
      <p>“We have studied all the documentation regarding the planning process and we are confident that all the correct investigations were completed prior to planning permission being granted and that all planning conditions that applied to the site were fulfilled.</p>
      <p>“In the immediate future, while there is still some site clearance work to do and some trees to remove, we just want to help residents to move back into their homes and help them pick up their lives and get back to normal.”</p>

      <p>They council have asked residents to allow contractors on to their land to allow the safety work to continue. They have also been asked to stay out of their gardens as much as possible.</p>
      <p>A stone path has been laid and a safety fence put up in the buffer zone along the back of gardens, parallel to the cliff-face.</p>
      <p>Residents affected by the land slip have claimed £120 from Nottinghamshire County Council’s Flood Hardship Fund and the council is arranging for them to receive £500 per household from the Government’s Community Relief Grant which is paid to local authorities affected by extreme weather.</p>
      <p>The affected households will also receive council tax relief for the period of their evacuation.</p>
