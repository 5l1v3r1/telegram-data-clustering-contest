      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:59:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-williams/" target="_blank">Olivia Williams</a></address>
      <p>A pair of Gucci-clad six-year-old twins have set their hopes on becoming Britain's next top models.</p>
      <p>Petra and Geva Foster, from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/maghull">Maghull,</a> have signed up to a modelling agency - Boss Management - and become the faces of the Manchester Arndale's Christmas campaign.</p>
      <p>With their big blue eyes, blonde hair and olive skin the girls' family hope they will make it big in the modelling world.</p>
      <p>Their mum Jodie Foster says the little <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton FC</a> supporters love to dress up and are often spotted dressed head to toe in designer labels.</p>

      <p>Jodie <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO:</a> "The girls do wear a lot of designer and the reason for that is it attracts more followers on their <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> - they are now becoming little fashion influences on there. </p>
      <p>"They are, to be honest, not that concerned with designer clothes although they do know the name Gucci, they just like to wear pretty girlie outfits and change a lot.</p>
      <p>"They always end up wanting to wear the same as now they realise people can’t tell them apart so they love to have fun and trick people."</p>

      <p>She added: "They are doing great in modelling and are really being noticed everywhere they have done jobs for the Manchester Arndale Christmas campaign, Ellesse, studio, Aldi and many more recently appearing on billboards.</p>
      <p>"The girls just love to get their photo taken and are so confident as a result of this. They would love to start going in to film work as they constantly say when can we be on telly?"</p>

      <p>The family said Petra and Geva have been likened to the Clement sisters, twins from America who were dubbed 'the most beautiful girls in the world' from various media outlets.</p>
      <p>The twins' step-mum, Maria Ellinas, who lives in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ormskirk">Ormskirk</a> , said the girls have been tagged on Instagram by people passing the Arndale shopping centre and spotting them in the Christmas adverts in Manchester.</p>

      <p>She <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO</a> : "The campaign has proven very popular and they are regularly getting tagged on their Instagram account by people passing by and photographing their faces on the billboards and tagging them on their social media.</p>
      <p>"The girls are well aware of their work and absolutely love the industry.</p>
      <p>"They are being compared to the Clement twins, who have been named the best looking identical twins in the world.</p>
      <p>"Well these girls are Liverpool’s own pair of modelling super stars."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/scouse-x-factor-finalist-hits-14873571">X Factor finalist</a> Maria, who appeared on the show in Simon Cowell's group in 2014, said she believes the girls' star sign explains why they love the limelight.</p>
      <p>She added: "They're little fashion icons and and they are Leos, so they love it.</p>
      <p>"They would be good in a film or something, they are destined for the screen those two."</p>
