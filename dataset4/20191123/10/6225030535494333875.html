      <p>Carlos Santamaria, who works as an assistant trainer for California-based Simon Callaghan, has handled, among others, multiple Grade 1 winner Bellafina and the promising juvenile filly Donna Veloce.</p>
      <p>In addition to being an integral part of the day-to-day operation of a major racing stable, Santamaria has also been dealing with serious health issues. Earlier this year, Santamaria was diagnosed with kidney failure. Doctors informed him that he needed a transplant, and he needed it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>In April, when Santamaria was at Churchill Downs helping prepare Bellafina for the Kentucky Oaks, he was put in touch with Mulligans, a Louisville-based volunteer organization that supports kidney-failure patients who need live donors.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.fox19.com/2019/11/21/california-horse-trainer-whose-story-went-national-gets-new-kidney-cincinnati/">According to a report from Cincinnati's FOX 19</a></b>, ads were placed to spread awareness that the horseman needed help. He ended up finding it in Suzanne Levanda, a family friend who underwent testing to confirm she's a match.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.fox19.com/2019/11/21/california-horse-trainer-whose-story-went-national-gets-new-kidney-cincinnati/">FOX 19 reported</a></b> the pair underwent surgery on Monday at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</p>
      <p>“Thanks is not enough,” Santamaria told the station. “You know, for me, like I told her, now she’s part of my family. I’m part of her family.”</p>
      <p>“All of my friends, everyone who heads about it, they tell me, ‘you’re heroic,’” Levenda added. “And I say, ‘no, this is about being human.’”</p>
