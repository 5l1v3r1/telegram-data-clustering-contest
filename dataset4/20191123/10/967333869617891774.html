        <b>President Trump and George Conway have an extremely “cordial” relationship and frequently trade insults on Twitter. Conway called Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria a “colossal geopolitical blunder” branding the president “incompetent”. Trump called Conway a “husband from hell”.</b>

      <p>US President Donald Trump has said White House counselor Kellyanne Conway “must have done some bad things” to her husband to make him behave like a “whack job”. Speaking in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Friday, he was asked to comment on George Conway’s speculation about former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley's attempts to become Trump’s running mate in 2020, replacing <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911191077352018-pence-classified-september-18-call-with-ukraines-zelensky---impeachment-witness-lawyer/">Vice President Mike Pence</a>. “Well, first of all, Kellyanne is great, but she’s married to a total whack job. I think she must have done some number on him”, the president said.</p>
      <p>After slamming George Conway, a consistent critic of Trump, who once called the president nuts, Trump reiterated his support for Vice President Mike Pence. “Nikki would be great, but Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as our vice president. He is our guy, he is my friend”, the president said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911201077356136-nikki-haley-mike-pence-us-presidential-elections/">Rumours have percolated for months</a> that Trump may replace Pence with the former US ambassador to the United Nations, who suddenly resigned from her post on 8 October 2018. Former governor of South Carolina, Haley has been widely viewed as a top contender for the Oval Office if she decides to run for president in 2024.</p>
      <p>In the same interview with Fox and Friends, President Trump praised her work as ambassador and speculated that she may return to politics.</p>
      <blockquote>"Nikki will absolutely be involved. She’s a friend of mine. She endorsed me with the most beautiful endorsement you’ve ever heard, she did a great job at the UN. She is now in the private sector. I assume she’s doing very well. But, Nikki will be back in some form because she’s great", President Trump said.</blockquote>
