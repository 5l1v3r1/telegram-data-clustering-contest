      <p>Numerous cars made their way through the parking lot at Taft Stadium on a recent Saturday, but they weren't there for a sports event.</p>
      <p>The stadium at 2101 N May Ave. was the site of a "No Hunger Holidays" outreach sponsored by Feed the Children in partnership with Cornerstone United Methodist Church.</p>
      <p>The outreach coordinated by the church provided an estimated 400 families with food and other items — just in time for Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>"Every Thanksgiving, we would do between 40 and 60 food baskets, but we wouldn't have the resources to do 400 — they do. It's a beautiful partnership," Tony Meazell, a Cornerstone member, said referring to the collaboration with Feed the Children.</p>
      <p>Mike Panas, Feed the Children's chief information officer, said his nonprofit liked the idea of working with local churches like Cornerstone and other groups. He said church members spread the word about the outreach to individuals and families, and that was a major boost to the project. The church also promoted the event at Taft Middle School, which agreed to allow the organizations to use the stadium's parking lot.</p>
      <p>"This church is here to serve the community," Panas said.</p>
      <p>Families who preregistered through the church picked up 25 pounds of food, including nonperishables, plus milk and bread from Braum's. Panas said families also received hygiene personal care boxes that included things like paper products and skin-care items that families can't purchase through government assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — known as WIC. Families also received a women's dignity box that included toiletry items.</p>
      <p>"If we can provide toothbrushes and things like that, that will free up their limited income for food," Panas said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Taft administrators, students and community volunteers took part in the outreach.</p>
      <p>Michelle Adams, the school's assistant principal, said the students were part of Taft's mentoring club and they enjoyed the opportunity to help others.</p>
      <p>"They've all said they like this, that it feels good to help people," Adams said.</p>
      <p>The Rev. John Punni, Cornerstone's senior pastor, was among the church volunteers who helped load cars with boxes of food and other items. He said the outreach was another way for the church, which sits adjacent to Taft Stadium, to serve the community.</p>
      <p>"It's just a great demonstration of love," he said. "We are just blessed to be a part of it."</p>
      <p>
        <b>One outreach begets another</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gary Warren, another Cornerstone member, said the Nov. 16 outreach evolved from Dinner Church, a meal outreach that Cornerstone, 2604 N May Ave., started in 2017. He said the church began offering a free meal to the community one day a month, and it became popular among people of different socioeconomic backgrounds from within and outside the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>In early 2019, the church began offering Dinner Church at 5 p.m. each Sunday, and Warren said about 125 people attend each week. Attendees are treated to a meal and a time to fellowship and pray together. A brief devotional is typically presented by a church leader, but Cornerstone also has had several guest speakers visit to deliver a timely message.</p>
      <p>Warren said church members have been inviting Dinner Church guests to the "No Hunger Holidays" outreach for weeks, and he had seen some of them drive up to get their holiday food boxes.</p>
      <p>Meazell said the meal-and-message dinner model is resonating with individuals and families, and he thinks it's because people have been gathering for food and fellowship for years.</p>
      <p>"Church happens around the dinner table for the most part," he said of Dinner Church. "It's kind of what Jesus did with his disciples. He told them to come, and they gathered around the table."</p>
