      <p>Repairs are set to start on windows broken at the Devon Energy Center when gear on a window-washing basket malfunctioned and it crashed repeatedly into the top of the 50-story tower.</p>
      <p>Two employees of Tulsa-based Budget Window Washing were in the basket during the May 15 incident that was broadcast live throughout the country.</p>
      <p>Surrounding streets and the Myriad Gardens were closed off for two weeks as glass debris was cleared. The Devon Energy campus and sidewalk facing Sheridan Avenue have been fenced off ever since.</p>
      <p>Devon spokesman John Porretto said work is about to begin, but he could not estimate when the work will be completed.</p>
      <p>“We’ve acquired the custom-fitted materials needed to begin the restoration process, and crews have been preparing for the work ahead,” Porretto said. “Completion will depend on weather conditions. We’ll take advantage of every opportunity we have and we’ll work non-stop when we can. The safety perimeter along Sheridan Avenue will remain in place until the restoration is complete.”</p>
