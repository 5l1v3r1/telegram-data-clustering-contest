      <h1>Manchester United 'most likely option' for Gareth Bale</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> are allegedly regarded as the 'premier option' as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gareth-bale/"><b>Gareth Bale</b></a> contemplates an exit from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite having over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, it appears increasingly likely that both parties will attempt to facilitate a transfer in one of the next two windows.</p>
      <p>After the appointment of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>, former club <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> have been suggested as a possible option for Bale in January.</p>
      <p>However, according to reports in Spain, the Wales international views United as his first-choice option should he return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Speculation has persisted regarding a potential swap deal involving <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paul-pogba/"><b>Paul Pogba</b></a>, with Real said to be keen on securing the services of the World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Real <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/transfer-talk/news/real-madrid-rule-out-january-exit-for-gareth-bale_380079.html">appear to have no interest</a> in parting with Bale for a cut-price fee.</p>
