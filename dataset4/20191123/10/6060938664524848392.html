      <h1>Watch 'Thalaivi' teaser: Kangana Ranaut impresses with her first look as late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa in upcoming biopic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:20:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Here it is, the first look of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kangana-Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a> as the late Tamil Nadu CM J <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/J.-Jayalalithaa">Jayalalithaa</a> in the upcoming <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/biopic">biopic</a> titled ‘Thalaivi’!</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the makers of the film and the actress unveiled the character poster that features Kangana looking like a spitting image of the late CM. It is only apt that the first look happens to be a large cut-out poster in itself, much like the ones that the put up in the city streets during the politician’s rallies.</p>
      <p>The impressive look has Kangana donning thick prosthetics, but still managing to bring through the soft Iron Lady’s soft smile while flashing her signature victory sign. The poster sees her donning a green saree with a matching overcoat.</p>
      <p>“The legend we know, but the story that is yet to be told! Presenting #KanganaRanaut, in &amp; as #Thalaivi. A film by #Vijay, arriving in cinemas on 26th June 2020,” Kangana’s sister, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rangoli-Chandel">Rangoli Chandel</a> captioned the poster that she shared on social media.</p>

      <p>Rangoli also surprised fans by dropping the teaser of the film that documents Jayalalithaa’s rise from a “Superstar Heroine” to “A Revolutionary Hero”.</p>
      <p>The 1.32-minute clip gives us a peek of Kangana emulating Jayalalithaa’s dance movies as seen in the 1965 film ‘Vennira Aadai’. The clip then cuts through to her waving the victory sign to all her supporters as she addressed a rally.</p>

      <p>Kangana’s impressive look in this upcoming biopic is the work of renowned Hollywood prosthetics artist, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jason-Collins">Jason Collins</a>, who has worked on films like 'Blade Runner' and 'Captain Marvel'. Interestingly, the actress will reportedly have four different looks in the film to best replicate her changing features and ageing through the course of the film.</p>
      <p>For her role in the film, Kangana has been taking lessons in Tamil and has also been learning the classical dance form - Bharatanatyam, videos of which we have already seen online.</p>
      <p>Directed by Vijay, the film will be shot simultaneously in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi.</p>
