      <p>Neymar was involved in the biggest transfer saga in the last window after the Ligue 1 giants revealed he wanted to leave the club, with a return to Barcelona on the cards.</p>
      <p>Pique revealed last month some of the players would change their contracts due to the Financial Fair Play issue should they sign the Brazilian.</p>
      <p>However, Suarez insists the players had no say when it came to the pursuit of their former star, who registered 105 goals and 76 assists in 186 appearances.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you have to take what Geri says with a pinch of salt," Suarez told Sport.</p>
      <p>"He has the gift of the gab and a lot of experience in making comments. In this case, he knows and is completely aware that the players were completely removed from the Ney case.</p>
      <p>"We were ready to welcome him - him or any other player that wants to come - but always distanced from what was going on."</p>
