      <h1>Asda worker describes how he helped rescue seven-week old baby from house fire</h1>
      <h2>'He's just our Habeel, our hero'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:44:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>An Asda home shopping driver said it was his "natural instinct" to step in and help rescue a baby from a house fire in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>Habeel Khan, 26, had been on his normal delivery rounds when he saw smoke coming from a house near <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/stapleford">Stapleford</a>.</p>
      <p>After stopping to investigate, a woman with two young children shouted her baby was still in the house.</p>
      <p>It was then that Habeel ran into the house with the woman to rescue the seven-week-old baby.</p>
      <p>Habeel, who works at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/asda">Asda</a> Home Shopping Centre in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bulwell">Bulwell</a>, said: "It was a just a normal day at work for me.</p>
      <p>"I was doing my deliveries in the Stapleford area and when I pulled up and looked over to where the customer's house was I saw loads of smoke just gushing out of a house.</p>
      <p>"My natural instinct was to just run across to the house. I could see loads of smoke and lots of people panicking outside.</p>
      <p>"I shouted 'is everyone out of the house?' and that's when a woman with two young children shouted 'my baby; my baby's still in the house.'</p>
      <p>"I don't think she had realised until then and then she ran back into the house and I went with her.</p>
      <p>"She managed to pick up the baby from a room next to the kitchen where the fire had started, then we ran out."</p>

      <p>Habeel stayed with the family and helped to calm them down until firefighters and paramedics arrived, before carrying on with the rest of his deliveries.</p>
      <p>He has been praised for his actions and was recently named Colleagues' Colleague of the Year at the Being Asda Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>He said: "I didn't really think anything of it – I just thought I'd helped out, and had done a little good deed.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I have done anything heroic at all to be honest. Thankfully everyone was okay in the end and the family are back in the house."</p>
      <p>Habeel's colleagues at the Nottingham Home Shopping Centre shared their reaction to his 'little good dead'.</p>
      <p>Claire Wilkes said: "Habeel doesn't think he is a hero, but we certainly do – he's amazing!"</p>
      <p>Bernie Drummond added: "Habeel's just great and everyone loves him here. He's just our Habeel, our hero."</p>
      <p>Habeel's manager Peter Smith said: "We know him as Smiler. He is always happy. He is always doing the right thing by the customer. He is an absolute asset to the team and a credit to the company."</p>
      <p>Asda's senior vice president of operations Anthony Hemmerdinger said: "What Habeel did was remarkable and it's not something we would recommend that our colleagues do, however it's clear that in this instance his instinct kicked in and he did a remarkable job."</p>
