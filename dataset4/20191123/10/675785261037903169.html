      <h1>England stars fully commit to 'lead by example' as Saracens tackle adversity</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:00:45+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Spink, https://www.facebook.com/alexspinkmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Jamie George has revealed a meeting took place at which Saracens’ England stars committed fully to rescuing their shamed club from the jaws of relegation.</p>
      <p>The Londoners play at home today for the first time since being dumped at the foot of the Premiership with a 35-point deduction for breaching salary cap regulations over three seasons.</p>
      <p>Their immediate challenge, against Ospreys, is to avoid losing their opening two matches of a Champions Cup campaign for the first time in nine years.</p>
      <p>After that their focus must quickly switch to the 18 league matches they have to try to make up a 26 point-deficit.</p>

      <p>George, Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, Elliot Daly, George Kruis and the Vunipola brothers were informed of the punishment on their first full day back from the World Cup.</p>
      <p>“We, as a senior playing group, had a chat and said we have to lead by example,” said George, who plays this afternoon along with Mako Vunipola, Kruis and new recruit Daly.</p>
      <p>“It is easy for us to talk about our culture and how strong we are and how tight we are as a group when we are winning trophies, but the real test is now.</p>

      <p>“The squad looks to the senior players. We can’t be moping around or worrying about anything else. We are here to focus on the rugby and drive the standards.”</p>
      <p>George knows internationals are restricted in the number of club matches they can play and that there will be an “extra emphasis” on them in those that they do to “be at the top of our game”.</p>
      <p>He admits to being “hugely excited” by the challenge as “for me it is good to be able to park the disappointment of the World Cup final and have something to go after”.</p>

      <p>But he is also conflicted at the prospect of leaving to play in the Six Nations as the club is in a hole and he wants to do all he can to dig it out.</p>
      <p>“Selfishly you want to progress in your career as much as you can and the way you do that is by playing for your country,” he said. “But we are in trouble at the minute and I just want to do as much as I can. It is a difficult decision that we will have to make.”</p>
      <p>Saracens’ punishment, which followed an investigation into business partnerships between chairman Nigel Wray and senior players, would bring almost any other club to its knees.</p>

      <p>The fact they believe they can beat the drop whilst challenging in Europe says everything about the strength of their squad - and leads many to wonder how they can possibly be under the salary cap now.</p>
      <p>Asked whether the players had been assured that all is now well, George admitted: “We haven’t spoken about it...the club doesn't have all the answers yet".</p>
      <p>Without complete transparency it is hard to see how a line can be drawn under this sorry episode.</p>
