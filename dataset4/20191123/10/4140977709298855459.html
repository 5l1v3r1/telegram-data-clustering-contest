          </p>
          <p>As Barcelona get ready to engulf themselves back into the gruelling and arduous title challenge in La Liga, the table toppers couldn’t have asked for a more easy to tie to resume proceedings in the league. When the side get ready to step out to middle today, they’ll be squaring off against last placed Leganes, a side who should be nothing more than mere pushovers for them.</p>
          <p>With just the one wicket from 13 matches, this Leganes unit is undoubtedly the worst side in the league. The side have put in appalling, abysmal and apathy filled displays, performances which have seen their ardent supporters be left perplexed and exasperated with the brand of football they have been doled out on a persistent basis by the side.</p>

                <p>Hammered down dead into last place, the writing on the wall for the side when Barcelona come calling today looks blatantly clear. For the home side, this encounter is a foregone conclusion, a result which looks set to have only one ending with Leganes’ aspirations of salvaging anything from this encounter begin negligible.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, Barcelona will be looking to not only win this one but thump Leganes in this clash as they look to lay down a marker and put in a pleasing to the eye display, one which sees them mount the pressure on Real Madrid who are persistently snapping on their heels. With both the sides level on 25 points ahead of today’s impending clash, a colossal win for Barcelona would massively spur their title fight, something we envisage the side doing today.</p>

                            <p>
                              <b>Leganes</b>

                            <h3>LEG Vs BAR Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Up against a side who are going to be unsparing in their attacking sojourns, this Leganes defence will be well aware that another callous display at the back will leave them in a qualm yet again. They’ll be needing their shot stopper, Ivan Cuellar to be at the pinnacles of his skill set today and although the likelihood of him emerging unblemished from this one is improbable, the saves he’s yet to accumulate makes him a relatively safe option.</p>
                            <h3>LEG Vs BAR Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Having scored the least goals of all sides in the league at a mere 7, Leganes look unlikely to add to that sorry number today not only owing to their lopsided and inclement attacking sojourns but the fact that Barcelona will be controlling a majority of the ball in this clash. Leganes will hardly be accorded with any chances to move forward, a gripping rhetoric which should see Barcelona peddle out a cleansheet in this tie.</p>
                            <p>It sees us descend on this encounter with the partnership of Charles Lenglet and Junior Firpo owing to this narrative whilst from the other side of this docket we are venturing in with Roberto Rosales. </p>
                            <h3>LEG Vs BAR Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Arthur Melo, Frankie de Jong and Ansu Fati are all being inducted into our Dream 11 side for this imminent encounter with the three players set to run the show in the centre of their side’s formation today. This will be a match where the trio will intertwine their skill set to keep moving the ball quickly and given the time and space they’ll be handed over, the trivalent will be allowed to express themselves freely and get a free hand to canter their way into the opposition’s side of the park.</p>
                            <p>From Leganes meanwhile we have opted for Roque Mesa and Oscar Rodriguez, two players who look the likeliest to string together any meaningful soiree the side will be capable of crafting in this encounter.</p>
                            <h3>LEG Vs BAR Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>His side’s leading scorer with the five goals and three assists, Lionel Messi is only bound to add to his tally when he takes on a defence which is going to be bereft of ideas on how to curtail him. Antoine Griezmann will thrive in this clash as well as he blatantly pummels the opposition to make him our second pick and make this slot all about the picks from Barcelona.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Lenglet will be representing our side as the captain while Messi from the same side is the vice-captain.</p>
