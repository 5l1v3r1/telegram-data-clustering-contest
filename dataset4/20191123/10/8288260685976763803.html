      <h1>'Knocking for him' - Aston Villa receive Jack Grealish transfer plea</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes former striker urging AVFC to hold onto Grealish</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa have been urged to turn down any advances for Jack Grealish and build the team around him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish,</a> 24, has been in inspired form this season after helping his boyhood club achieve promotion back to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>His injury has coincided with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa’s</a> struggles in recent weeks – <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith’s</a> side losing three Premier League games on the spin including the defeat at Manchester City when Grealish hobbled off.</p>
      <p>And Emile Heskey says his former club must to do everything they can to hold onto their talisman when suitors come knocking.</p>

      <p>"It's amazing how far he's come, when I was at Villa he was 15 and getting a run in training with the senior team," Heskey told <a href="https://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/heskey-exclusive-massive-aston-villa-must-build-around-grealish-4304936?utm_source%3Dnewsnow%26utm_medium%3Drss-feed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed-Latest%2BArticles#popup-sso">Tribal Football.</a></p>
      <p>"As a young lad he was running rings around us and making us look silly, we could see the potential even back then. Makes you wonder who else the clubs are producing these days and how many come from the youth teams, especially in your top four clubs.</p>
      <p>"They'll do alright if they can keep a hold of him, but just as importantly develop players or recruit the right kind of squad around him. He's such an important part to that Villa line up, and it wouldn't surprise me if another club comes knocking for him."</p>

      <p>Villa are sat one place above the relegation zone ahead of Monday's clash against Newcastle United but Heskey thinks things will soon turn around.</p>
      <p>"They've got massive potential, easily," Heskey said. “The club has such a huge history and a wonderful stadium but the important part is they don't throw a whole load of money in order to do that.</p>
      <p>"They've got the right idea in building a strong foundation, the rest of it will follow such as revenue, player development and retention, and the on field success as a result of all these things."</p>
