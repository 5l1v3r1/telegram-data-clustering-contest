      <h3>THE Malabon City Land Transportation Office (LTO) will strictly enforce the “No Arbor Policy” to all motorists who will be apprehended for violating traffic rules, particularly drivers who park their vehicles in a no parking zone.</h3>
      <p>Malabon LTO branch chief Milagros Delos Reyes ordered her law enforcement team not to entertain anyone, even police officers or public officials, who will ask to grant favour to erring motorists.</p>
      <p>“Huwag kayong makikipag-usap sa sinumang gustong umarbor, basta tuluyan ninyong isyuhan ng tiket ang lahat ng lalabag sa batas trapiko,” Delos Reyes told her law enforcement team.</p>
      <p>Delos Reyes said the Malabon LTO enforcement team will continue to conduct clearing operation to free all the primary and secondary roads in the city from any obstructions to achieve free flow of traffic on the streets.</p>
      <p>She also ordered the apprehension of drivers of colorum and cutting trip of public utility vehicles while calling for the cooperation of private motorists to follow traffic rules and regulation.</p>
      <p>The Malabon LTO chief said they will continue to hold a series of seminars on road safety operation such as wearing of seatbelts and helmets.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Malabon LTO Enforcement Team emerged as the best team in the National Capital Region.</p>
