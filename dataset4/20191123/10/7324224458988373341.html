      <h1>Let’s hope for Gayle in January sales...</h1>
      <h2>In just six weeks the January transfer window will open.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:12:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>At one stage it looked as though the month would pass by relatively quietly at The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>But now it seems Albion could be in for a busy and potentially season-defining few weeks with a number of issues needing to be resolved.</p>
      <p>The first is the need for a striker who not only suits the way Slaven Bilic wants to play, but also scores goals.</p>
      <p>For whatever reason, it just hasn’t happened for Charlie Austin since his £4million arrival from Southampton.</p>
      <p>The same can be said for Kenneth Zohore – who was also signed for a hefty transfer fee – but has barely featured.</p>
      <p>To the immense credit of Hal Robson-Kanu, he has stepped up while the other forwards have struggled.</p>
      <p>But Albion need more firepower up there. Dwight Gayle is likely to be their primary target.</p>
      <p>The striker netted 24 goals in 41 appearances while on loan with the Baggies last season.</p>
      <p>But he has featured just twice in the Premier League for Newcastle this term.</p>
      <p>And reports in the North East earlier this week suggested Newcastle are willing to listen to offers for the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>Signing Gayle would not only bring goals – it would also be a huge PR victory for the Albion hierarchy.</p>
      <p>But if they can’t get him, there are other options out there, including Britt Assombalonga who is too good to be battling it out at the wrong end of the Championship.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Albion will have to act if Nathan Ferguson is sold or Grady Diangana is recalled from his loan by West Ham.</p>
      <p>When it comes to Diangana, Hammers boss Manuel Pellegrini has done everything he can to suggest the winger will remain at The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>But if the Chilean loses his job, any new boss would be mad not to recall Diangana – just for a few weeks at least – so they can run the rule over him.</p>
      <p>Albion need a contingency with Kyle Edwards and Chris Willock not yet ready to start week-in, week-out. The issue with Ferguson is also fascinating.</p>
      <p>Everyone hopes he will remain at the club with the 19-year-old having been offered an attractive deal to stay.</p>
      <p>But if he isn’t going to sign it, Albion simply have to sell him in January – the club cannot let him run down his contract and leave for a reduced fee.</p>
      <p>Tottenham and Crystal Palace are believed to be the two Premier League teams interested in Ferguson. But Jose Mourinho’s appointment at Spurs may prove a turning point.</p>
      <p>A 19-year-old who hasn’t yet made 15 professional appearances isn’t the type of player the Portuguese boss usually buys.</p>
      <p>And the fact Mauricio Pochettino has been moved on and his replacement named just 24 hours later shows just how quickly things change.</p>
      <p>In Bilic, Ferguson has a head coach who really believes in him, after all the Croatian plucked him from relative obscurity in the summer.</p>
      <p>Maybe Mourinho’s arrival will help Ferguson realise he is better off staying put.</p>
      <p>Albion will hope that January will prove to be a quiet month.</p>
      <p>If Austin and Zohore can start scoring and if Ferguson and Diangana stay, the squad is nicely balanced. But when does the window ever pass without drama? As it stands a striker is a must. And a winger and a right-back may have to follow.</p>
