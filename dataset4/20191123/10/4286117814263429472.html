      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Opposition left reeling by BJP's 'Pawar grab'</li>
        <li>Sharad Pawar says NCP not involved</li>
        <li>Here's a look back at what happened after 2014 polls</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So far, Sharad Pawar's Saturday has been rather more hectic than he might have hoped. Well, that's probably an understatement.</p>
      <p>The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief found out this morning -- like nearly everyone else -- that his nephew Ajit Pawar had joined a BJP-led government as deputy chief minister. Or, did he actually?</p>
      <p>The news was so unexpected that one Congress leader initially thought it was fake. And, then he went on to say "Pawar Saheb tussi great ho" without revealing which Pawar -- Sharad or Ajit.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar quickly tweeted a denial of his involvement. Then, in the afternoon, he and Uddhav Thackeray -- the man he said would be the chief minister of an alliance that looked set to form the next government till late Friday night -- put up a show of unity before a crowd of reporters bursting with questions.</p>
      <p>It may have been the BJP (with help from Ajit Pawar) which sprang today's surprise, but in 2014, it was Sharad Pawar who tried to outmanoeuvre the Shiv Sena after the election that landed Devendra Fadnavis in the chief minister's office.</p>
      <p>In October that year, NCP leader Praful Patel offered outside support to the BJP, which had fallen short of majority -- with 122 seats in a Maharashtra Assembly that has 288 elected members. At the time, the BJP and the Shiv Sena were exploring the possiblity of re-cementing their 25-year-old alliance. The old allies had contested the state election separately.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar himself made the offer the following day, saying that an NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance (the very same combination that appeared poised to take charge this week) would not be possible.</p>
      <p>The BJP had back then politely declined Pawar's offer, believing that the Shiv Sena would come around.</p>
      <p>In the end the Shiv Sena joined the government.</p>
      <p>But the Sena and the BJP have had a difficult, on-again-off-again relationship despite having ideological points of agreement.</p>
      <p>Their most recent falling out came after the October 2019 election, when they could not agree to share the chief minister's job using a rotation policy. President's Rule was imposed after the BJP, the Shiv Sena and the NCP did not show interest to form government in their individual capacities when Governor BS Koshyari invited them to stake claim.</p>
      <p>President's Rule was revoked at 5.47 am today. Shortly after, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar appeared on TV screens across India. They were administered oaths by Koshyari as Maharashtra chief minister and deputy chief minister, respectively.</p>
