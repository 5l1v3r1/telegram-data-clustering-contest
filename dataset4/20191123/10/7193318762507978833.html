      <p>Here's an oddly cropped snapshot of the sluggish Oklahoma City office market, ever beholden to the oil and gas business, which is struggling despite hitting on all cylinders, so to peak — peak production, that is.</p>
      <p>The biggest lease in the third quarter was by an energy company leasing half of its own former headquarters back from local investors who bought it.</p>
      <p>Peak crude oil production, 12.4 million barrels per day in August, the most recent figures available, is not translating into peak anything else for the energy sector — or the office leasing sector.</p>
      <p>Chaparral Energy Inc., laboring under especially anemic stock prices, was the most significant office lessee in the city July-September, according to NAI Sullivan Group's just-released third-quarter office market report.</p>
      <p>The New York Stock Exchange notified Chaparral a week ago, after it failed to meet the minimum average share price of $1 for 30 straight trading days, that it could be delisted if its stock price doesn't improve.</p>
      <p>As The Oklahoman previously reported, Chaparral can get back in the stock exchange's good graces any time in the next six months if, on the last trading day of two consecutive calendar months during the period, its common stock has a closing share price of at least $1. CHAP closed Friday at 88 cents per share.</p>
      <p>Chaparral sold its four-story, 141,537-square-foot headquarters at 701 Cedar Lake Blvd., near Britton Road and N Kelley Avenue, to Skybridge Ventures LLC for $17,699,998 in late August, according to county records. It leased back two floors, 70,800 square feet, NAI Sullivan said. The company said it used proceeds partly to reduce debt by $8 million, even as it also reported boosting production.</p>
      <p>Advances in technology and other changes in the energy business aren't the only reason office leasing is sluggish despite low general unemployment and an increasing metro-area population. The home office trend and tech changes in other sectors are also doing it more harm than good. NAI Sullivan CEO Bob Sullivan said maybe "some event" or "just time" could turn things around.</p>
      <p>The peak price for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude was more than five years ago, at $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Friday afternoon, crude was trading at $57.92 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Rig count doesn't mean anything anymore because of multihole drilling platforms. "Boom" has lost its meaning: More oil is being produced in this country than ever.</p>
      <p>After the '80s oil bust, people in the business in Oklahoma, Texas, and the other oil states hocked their gold nugget rings and ostrich skin boots and prayed (and put on bumperstickers): "Lord, grant us one more oil boom. We promise not to (bleep) it away."</p>
      <p>What's left to sell now? And what do we pray for?</p>
      <p>When times are good in the patch, it is sometimes said that prices in real estate deals by oil companies — office buildings, not trading in mineral rights — are about as important as accounting errors.</p>
      <p>Today, that sounds like gallows humor.</p>
