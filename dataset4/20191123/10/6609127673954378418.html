        <b>CELTIC boss Neil Lennon has cooled talk of a Scotland recall for Scott Brown.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> revealed that the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> captain was refusing to rule out a sensational comeback if Scotland get to Euro 2020.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4982991/euro-2020-scotland-nations-league-play-off/">Israel will be Scotland’s first opponents in the play-offs</a> after the draw was made in Nyon.</p>
      <p>That tie will be at Hampden on March 26, with the winners then travelling to face Norway or Serbia for a place at the finals.</p>
      <p>But Lenny admitted he’d need to “talk to him” if his captain got the call.</p>
      <p>Brown quit <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> for the second time in February 2018, but has now opened the door to a potential return.</p>

      <p>Lennon said: “First of all, there would need to be a conversation between Steve Clarke and Broony, then I’d need to have a conversation with him as well.</p>
      <p>“He’s currently getting a benefit from not playing international football, but how much I don’t know.</p>
      <p>“He’s certainly playing very well at the moment and there’s no question he could still make a contribution to the Scottish team.</p>
      <p>“So it would be down to the chat between those two. I think they’ve had conversations before but I don’t know whether or not that line is still open.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he was to be called up and I totally get the attraction for Scott of having an appearance at a major finals on his CV, but how would his comeback affect the rest of the group, the people who’ve been performing?</p>
      <p>“The Scotland midfield’s functioned very well in their last few games and they have Scott McTominay to come back in as well.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, it will come down to Steve’s call and then we’ll take it from there.”</p>
      <p>However, Lennon hinted he would never try to stop a player playing for his country.</p>
      <p>He insisted: “There’s too much negativity around players who want to go and play for their country.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a group of Scottish lads who have come back buzzing after winning two games.</p>
      <p>“Greg Taylor hasn’t been playing here but he has now got two good international performances under his belt.</p>
      <p>“Some people say they play too much football.</p>
      <p>"But the flip side of that is Greg and Nir Bitton, who haven’t had much game time, have come back into our group fully match fit and happy.</p>
      <p>“Callum McGregor, Ryan Christie and James Forrest were also pleased with the round of games and three wins in a row will be good for them psychologically.</p>
      <p>“You can cast aspersions on the quality of the opposition but that doesn’t matter. Winning is vital and now they have the most important matches for years coming in March.”</p>
