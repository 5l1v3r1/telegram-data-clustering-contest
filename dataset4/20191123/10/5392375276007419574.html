      <p>Visionox Unveils Their Latest Foldable Phone Prototype<br/>4.2 (84%) 5 votes</p>
      <p>Chinese manufacturer Visionox is quickly becoming one of the biggest players in the smartphone display business. The company did indeed produce the AMOLED displays for both the Mi MIX Alpha and Xiaomi Mi Note 10, thus taking the some of the market share previously held by Samsung. Today, the brand made it clear once again that they’re second to none, let alone Samsung. Say hello to the folding phone prototype by Visionox.</p>

      <p>As we can see in the image above, the Visionox foldable prototype sports a design very close to the latest <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/16/motorola-razr-2019-china-5g/">Motorola Razr 2019,</a> this means we have a clamshell design instead of the tablet folding into a phone; like what we see with the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X.</p>
      <p>In the short GIF we also notice that the handset is slightly bent even when totally unfolded, that’s also similar to the Motorola Razr and it probably helps it have less of a crease on the screen.</p>

      <p>The Visionox phone isn’t identical to the Motorola Razr 2019 though. The former does not feature a smaller display on the outside, making it impossible to use when folded. Not that you can do much on the Razr 2019 either.</p>
      <p>At the moment, there are a total of “four” foldable devices on the market. Including the Flexpay, Samsung Galaxy Fold, Huawei Mate X and the Samsung W20 5G; the latter is a Galaxy Fold rebranded for China.</p>

      <p>Hopefully Visionox will be able to bring the fifth ever foldable phone very soon as the folding trend is likely not going away any soon.</p>
