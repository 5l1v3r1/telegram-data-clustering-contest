      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Davido</a>‘s fiancee, Chioma Rowland has shunned some of her Instagram followers who kept lecturing her on how to raise her son, David junior.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> reports that she shared a video of herself bottle feeding her son while listening to a song off Davido’s new album ‘A good time’ when her followers advised her to breastfeed him often.</p>
      <p>A follower said: “absolutely beautiful experience, but please let him suck directly for close bonding” after which she responded by saying she does that often.</p>
      <p>Another follower, “bottle feeding does not create a bond, also it is not healthy”</p>
      <p>In her reaction, Chioma who seemingly lost patience asked the followers to let her be.</p>
      <p>She said “Bruh you people should leave me alone”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/20/davido-chioma-welcome-baby-boy-photo/">Davido had announced the birth of his son</a>, David Adedeji Ifeanyi Adeleke Jr in the early hours of Sunday, October 20.</p>
