      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> fans were reunited with a familiar face earlier this week as a regular actor returned to the cobbles for his fifth stint playing a new character.</p>
      <p>Mark Chatterton is on his fifth stint and fourth role in Weatherfield after first appearing as Neville Hawthorne in a few episodes in 1986.</p>
      <p>He returned for a run in 1992 and 1993 when he was cast as Gordon Blinkhorn, Raquel Wolstenholme’s admirer.</p>
      <p>And after a one-off appearance as Gerry Burton in 2003, he returned as Neville in 2005 and 2007.</p>

      <p>Eagle-eyed Corrie fans noticed the the actor returned to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street-cast">Cobbles cast</a> this week playing his fourth character - pawn shop owner Barry Morgan.</p>
      <p>Mark has also had bit-parts in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/emmerdale">Emmerdale</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/casualty">Casualty</a> , as well as roles in The Cops and My Parents Are Aliens.</p>
      <p>Several fans recognised the actor straight away, as others began wondering where they had seen Barry before.</p>
      <p>Viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after working out where they’d seen her before, with one fan saying: “Classic Corrie guest star alert! That was Raquel’s ex-boyfriend Gordon-slash-Norris’s son in law Neville — actor Mark Chatterton — as the pawn shop owner.”</p>

      <p>Another said: “He's been in Corrie on and off for years. So funny to see him reappear in yet another guise!”</p>
      <p>Hoards of thankful fans replied to thank vigilant Corrie lovers for reminding them why Chatterton’s face was so familiar.</p>
      <p>But this is not the first time Coronation Street devotees have noticed reoccurring actors on the soap.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Carla Connor was reunited with a familiar face as she headed to hospital following her mental breakdown.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/you-recognise-carlas-consultant-coronation-16156339">actress, played by actress Olwen May, had in fact been on the soap before</a> , filming alongside Carla and Peter in 2011 after her harrowing rape ordeal at the hands of evil ex Frank Foster.</p>
      <p>But in this era, she played a different character and portrayed the role of DC Joyce Malone who was leading the investigation into the allegations against Frank.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t the only character Olwen has played on the ITV soap though, with the actress having been on the show in a whopping five different roles.</p>
      <p>Before her stint in 2011, the actress played Jessica Lundy in 1999 and 2000.</p>
      <p>In this stint she was a reverend, and she married Hayley and Roy Cropper.</p>
      <p>Prior to this, Olwen played another detective on the soap, portraying DC Chapman in 1991.</p>
      <p>Finally, her other role in the soap was in 1990, when she played a character named Christine Woods who was a recruitment agent.</p>
