      <p>Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba has lashed at theÂ  Chinese Deputy Ambassador for breaking protocol and welcoming Vice President Constantino Chiwenga at the airport on Saturday morning. <br/><br/>Chiwenga was arriving from a medical pilgrimage in China whe he was being treated for multiple organ failure. <br/><br/>Said Charamba, "TWI-PROTOCOL? Interesting that well-known oppositional twi-voices seek to teach is how to welcome and love our leaders! Itsitsi dzei? For the record, ED who is Head of State and President of Zimbabwe does not - repeat - DOES NOT receive his Deputy. In the same vein, the Chinese Ambassador who personifies the Chinese State here in Zimbabwe WILL NOT receive a Vice President of the State to which he is accredited. Protocol does not allow both cases. For the record, President Mnangagwa and his Deputy enjoyed daily communication while the VP was away."<br/><br/>Charamba said President Mnangagwa will meet Chiwenga at an appropriate time.</p>

      <p>"The President will meet and welcome his Deputy in the appropriate way and setting. In the meantime, all well-meaning Zimbabweans rejoice that Vice President Chiwenga is back and looks fit."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Chiwenga has received President Mnangagwa at his Munhumutapa offices for a briefing.<br/><br/>The President was accompanied by the First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa.</p>
