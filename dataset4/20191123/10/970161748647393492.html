      <p>One potato, two potato, three potato four, five potato, six potato AND NO MORE could be the new mantra among BBC staff if newly imposed restrictions on side orders stick.</p>
      <p>In a half-baked idea the corporation’s canteen cut portions of the popular fried treat to just six chips.</p>
      <p>Servers began ‘counting out’ unhappy meals on Friday causing ‘uproar’ among bemused workers – with several sharing their displeasure on social media.</p>
      <p>Daniel Sandford, a home affairs correspondent for BBC News, wrote on Twitter: ‘I was given six at 12.10pm.’</p>
      <p>Arif Ansari, head of news for BBC Asian Network, tweeted a picture showing a smattering of chips next to a chicken leg dressed in a sort of salsa verde that was unlikely to draw praise from Michelin inspectors.</p>

      <p>He wrote: ‘New rules in the BBC canteen limit the number of chips to six! The staff seemed shocked that I didn’t go with the unlimited couscous instead.’</p>
      <p>Dom Stirling, a freelance radio producer at the BBC, added: ‘There is currently uproar in the canteen as the ‘6 chip rule’ is introduced… In which servers are instructed to individually count out 6 chips per person. I wish this was a joke.’</p>
      <p>The BBC denied any such rule had been introduced and its press office Twitter account shared a picture of a box stuffed with least nine chips.</p>
      <p>It said: ‘There’s something a little fishy about this as there is definitely no six-chip rule (see today’s lunch for evidence!) – we don’t want to get chippy about it but we’re frying to get to the bottom of it.’</p>
      <p>Some have also reported a loosening of the regulation –  although whether this was a formal relaxation of the chip clampdown or the work of rebellious rogue canteen staff is unclear</p>
      <p>BBC News producer Callum May tweeted: ‘UPDATE: Just been told by a canteen source (as I was served a total of 14 chips) that the six-chip rule has been ‘relaxed’.’</p>
      <p>The BBC has been contacted about this story.</p>
      <p>Over at rival broadcaster Sky there is a french fry free-for all.</p>
