      <h1>The first Tottenham line up under Jose Mourinho as Spurs fans pick the team they want to see</h1>
      <h2>Who do fans want to see in the new boss' first starting line up?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Amie Wilson</a></address>
      <p>It has been a busy week at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but attention now turns back to matters on the field as Spurs travel to the London Stadium to take on West Ham United.</p>
      <p>The match is Jose Mourinho's first in charge of the club since taking over from Mauricio Pochettino, and fans will be wondering what changes, if any, he will make to the starting 11.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the match, <b>football.london</b> gave fans the chance to tell Mourinho the team that they would like to see him pick against the Hammers, and here is what they had to say.</p>
      <p>Supporters would like to see two changes in the back line from the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United before the international break, with Juan Foyth and Toby Alderweireld coming into the team, with the former replacing Serge Aurier at right-back.</p>
      <p>Despite Alderweireld's inclusion in defence alongside Davinson Sanchez, Eric Dier still gets to keep a place in the starting line up, but is pushed into a defensive midfield role. Dele Alli and Giovani Lo Celso make up the midfield three, meaning there is no place for Tanguy Ndombele or Moussa Sissoko.</p>
      <p>Lucas Moura was also selected on the right side of a front three, with Son Heung-min and talisman Harry Kane making up the attacking threat.</p>
