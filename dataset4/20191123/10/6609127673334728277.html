        <b>HEARTS caretaker boss Austin MacPhee has hit back at Allan Preston over the former Jambo's criticism of him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Preston blasted the manager and insisted he shouldn't be anywhere near the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Tynecastle club</a> on BBC's Sportsound show before their recent win over St Mirren.</p>

      <p>He made more claims about MacPhee before adding that the interim gaffer had stuck "two fingers up to Craig Levein".</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland have since issued an on-air apology to the Jambos' caretaker boss after they received two official complaints.</p>
      <p>But now MacPhee has blasted Preston in response as he accused the pundit of telling lies about him.</p>
      <p>Speaking yesterday, he said: "The results I have had as the manager speak for themselves.</p>

      <p>"I mentioned them last week and prior to the game I spoke with confidence about what I thought the team could achieve in that game and where I think the club can go.</p>
      <p>"I know in particular Allan Preston on the BBC opened the programme before the game by trying to discredit me with four different statements in particular, which were just lies which I was very disappointed with.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a slight on the players, a slight on the club and for the BBC's voice of Hearts to make these statements I thought was very poor because, for example, he stated that all we were doing was bringing in players from Manchester City's academy.</p>
      <p>"I believe the difference between a lie and an error is if it's done with malice.</p>
      <p>"And I believe that if you open the show heavily critical of me then back it up with four points which are factually incorrect, I believe that's four lies.</p>
      <p>"So the first one was that we are bringing in players from Manchester City's academy.</p>
      <p>"That's fabrication, it's not true. Ryo (Meshino) signed for €1m from Gamba Osaka, he didn't set foot in Manchester City's Academy.</p>
      <p>"The second one was that Craig Wighton was brought in from nowhere so I could stick two fingers up to Craig Levein. That is a complete lie.</p>

      <p>"Craig Wighton, in his last two games when he was fit and available started at Parkhead then came on in the Cup Final before suffering a medial ligament injury in pre-season at Inverness so the Rangers game was the first game that he could be selected.</p>
      <p>"So there is two criticisms of the club and the players.</p>
      <p>"Following that he also said that the academy wasn't working and that the last player to be sold from the academy was Callum Paterson.</p>
      <p>"That's not true either, Callum left in 2017. In 2017 Marc Leonard left for Brighton and in 2018 Jamie Walker left for Wigan so there is three lies to back up his case.</p>
      <p>"The final one is that I brought in Malaury Martin. That again is not true, It is a complete fabrication.</p>
      <p>"If you are going to associate any players with me surely it would be the ones from Northern Ireland which include the top goalscorer since John Robertson, and also the biggest return on investment we have had at the club have been Esmael Goncalves and Kyle Lafferty, two strikers that I recommended be brought in.</p>
      <p>"I was very disappointed to be put on the back foot immediately and I feel that today I have to tell the supporters that they can't trust the information that BBC Hearts expert is putting out there.</p>
      <p>"So I need to address these to defend my players, the team, the academy staff and also make sure that the truth is told.</p>
      <p>"The apology from the BBC apologised for the tone and lack of balance. Honestly, I'm not bothered.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter, but I think particularly in the case of Allan he's better trying to improve his argument than he is raising his voice.</p>
      <p>"And if he's trying to improve his argument with four lies, and there's more, I could go on but we don't have too long, is a better way to go about things."</p>
