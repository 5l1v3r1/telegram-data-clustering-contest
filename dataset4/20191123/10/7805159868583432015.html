      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11e leaked renders reveal triple rear cameras and curved display</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:56:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/aamirsiddiqui/" target="_blank">Aamir Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p>As we inch our way closer to 2020, we are beginning to get our leaks at the next generation of flagships. The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-8-punch-hole-display-triple-cameras-leak/">OnePlus 8</a> was leaked just a week after the launch of the OnePlus 7T, and leaks for the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-8-pro-leaked-renders-show-quad-camera-setup-punch-hole-display/">OnePlus 8 Pro</a> followed along later. Just yesterday, we got our first look at the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-leaked-renders-penta-camera-setup-centered-hole-punch-display/">Samsung Galaxy S11</a>, and today, <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1198254635833802753"><i>@OnLeaks</i></a> has released high-quality renders of the Samsung Galaxy S11e.</p>

      <p>While the Galaxy S11 comes with a penta-rear camera setup, the Galaxy S11e comes with a more modest triple-rear camera system. The camera module follows the same design as the S11 though, despite bearing fewer cameras.</p>

      <p>The back of the device on the S11e is not as exciting as the front is, mainly for the fact that the S11e will come with a curved display and not a flat display as the S10e did. This also means that there are no bezels on the left and right edges of the device and very thin bezels on the top and bottom. <i>@OnLeaks</i> mentions that the display could measure between 6.2″-6.3″ diagonally.</p>

      <p>What it also shares with its elder siblings is the centered punch-hole front camera, as well as the fact that there is no headphone jack on this device either. The device is said to roughly measure 151.7 x 69.1mm x 7.9mm, though the thickness increases to 9.1mm around the camera bump.</p>
      <p>As per our own sources, the Samsung Galaxy S11e will be available in both 5G (SM-G981) and LTE (SM-G980) variants, though India will only get the LTE variant while the USA will only get the 5G variant.</p>
      <p>Internal specifications for the Galaxy S11e are not yet confirmed through reliable sources, but based on past trends, one can guess that the phone will share several hardware and software features with others in the lineup. However, it is unlikely that the S11e will come with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-app-8k-video-209-aspect-ratio-108mp/">108MP primary camera</a>, as it will be positioned as a cheaper alternative to the main phones.</p>
