The track seems a poignant reminder of thanking the unsung heroes of the unfaithful 26/11 attacks.</p>
      <p>Composed and sung by Mithoon along with Sunidhi Chauhan and BPraak, it’s a touching number that reiterates people’s belief in humanity.

      <p>The song encapsulates the same sentiment and has been written by Mithoon himself. The song also features a choir of 40 singers alongside the notable singers. Presented by Zee Studios and Purpose Entertainment,<i> Hotel Mumbai</i> will be released on November 29 in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages.</p>
