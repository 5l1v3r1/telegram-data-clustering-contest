      <p>The social media user, @HMphotographyx revealed he had been waiting to get this admission for 6 years and he now that he got it, he doesn’t have the admission fee and is ready to show proof of his admission. He wrote;</p>
      <blockquote>“I swear I just got admission into Yabatech after waiting for six years, admission fee and school fee him be problem now, I have proof of admission”</blockquote>
      <p>The tweet got Zlatan’s attention but his response was not what the fan must have anticipated. He told said God probably does not want him to go to school, adding that he too didn’t complete his education. He wrote;</p>
      <blockquote>“Maybe God no want make you go school, me sef no finish”</blockquote>
