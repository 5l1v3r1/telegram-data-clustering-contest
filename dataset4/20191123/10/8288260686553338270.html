      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> "remain interested" in Said Benrahma ahead of the January transfer window, according to Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>Villa boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> knows the Algerian winger very well, having signed him for Brentford from Nice when he was in charge at Griffin Park.</p>
      <p>Smith was eager to bring the 24-year-old to Villa Park during the summer, as he prepared his squad for a return to the Premier League, but the club failed to agree a deal with the Bees, who are said to value him at £20m.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports suggest Smith could make a fresh bid for Benrahma, who has scored 12 goals in 51 Championship matches for Brentford, when the January transfer window opens for business, although the price tag might once again prove a stumbling block.</p>
