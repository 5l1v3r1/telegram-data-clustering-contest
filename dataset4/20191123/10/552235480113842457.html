      <h2>A catalogue of ex-SPFL stars have taken the top flight by storm south of the border, and picking a starting lineup from them has never been easier.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:15:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson continue to be named in virtually every all-star XI that gets written up around this time of year, with their role in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> 's phenomenal start to the season catching eyes all over the globe.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, sitting second in the Premier League, are Brendan Rodgers' Leicester, inspired by former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> midfielder James Maddison.</p>
      <p>Despite all the stick the 'tinpot' SPFL gets south of the border, it has never been more abundant that Scottish football is a proven breeding ground for top-class talent.</p>
      <p>Whether it be a home-grown Scot venturing towards the money and making a name for himself, or a foreign import taking the next step after showcasing their talents at a Scottish ground, it is nothing new to see a name familiar to SPFL fans showing what they can do when given a crack at the big-time.</p>
      <p>So, as the latest cusp of SPFL alumni take the football world by storm, <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>have dug deep, and come up with the best XI - in an all-out attacking formation - currently active in the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>GK - Artur Boruc</h3>

      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> keeper is still on the books at Bournemouth, playing second-fiddle to the emerging Aaron Ramsdale after signing a one-year contract extension in the summer.</p>
      <p>Now 39, he's made over 100 appearances for Southampton and the Cherries in the top-flight down south, keeping a respectable 39 clean sheets in the process.</p>
      <h3>RWB - Matt Doherty</h3>

      <p>'He never played in Scotland!' a Wolves fan may reply, foolishly forgetting that their star right-back spent half a season on loan in Leith in the second half of the 2011/12 season.</p>
      <p>Hibs fans might write him out of the memory as well, in fact, seeing as he played 90 minutes in their infamous 5-1 Scottish Cup final drubbing at the hands of Hearts.</p>
      <p>Since then, he's scored or assisted a remarkable 60 goals in 269 appearances for Wolves.</p>
      <h3>CB - Virgil van Dijk</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Is there anything left to say about the Dutch Goliath that hasn't already been said?</p>
      <p>He's widely considered the best central defender the world on his performances at Anfield over the last two years, and he owes a good deal of his development to the 115 appearances he made at Celtic Park.</p>
      <h3>CB - Filip Benkovic</h3>

      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>His injury situation means Benkovic has had a hard time breaking into the Leicester team under Rodgers this season, but his loan spell at Parkhead last season proved he has the quality to make his mark at the King Power when he gets the chance.</p>
      <p>At 22, he remains highly thought of at the club despite his lack of chances, as evidenced by the £13m spent on him last summer.</p>
      <h3>CB - Kieran Tierney</h3>

      <p>The most expensive Scottish export ever found himself dropped for Arsenal's clash with Leicester after his first two start of the season.</p>
      <p>The result was a 2-0 defeat for Unai Emery's strugglers, and the performance of Sead Kolasinac in that one suggests it won't be long before Tierney makes the spot his own.</p>
      <p>He slots in at left centre-half in a back three here - there's another left-back who just edges it.</p>
      <h3>LWB - Andy Robertson</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The Jurgen Klopp era at Liverpool has yielded many a fantastic signing, but the shrewdest among them remains the acquisition of Robertson from Hull in 2017.</p>
      <p>The fee of £8m was seen as a punt on the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United</a> and Queen's Park man, but after taking some time to settle, he has proved himself as one of the most efficient attacking full-backs in the world.</p>
      <h3>CM - Victor Wanywama</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article1743451.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Juventus%20v%20Celtic.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: PA Wire)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>His stock has fallen after falling out of favour during a turbulent time at Tottenham, but Wanyama's Premier League career has proven him to be a capable and destructive force in the engine room.</p>
      <p>The arrival of Jose Mourinho seems likely to spell either the end of his Spurs career or the start of an unlikely arrival, but either way he will have made his mark.</p>
      <p>The Kenyan was linked with a return to Celtic in the summer, and may well pull on the Hoops again one day</p>
      <h3>CM - John McGinn</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Image: SNS Group)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Scotland's new goalscoring talisman after netting seven goals in his last seven internationals, McGinn has gone from strength to strength with some gusto in a whirlwind two years since swapping Hibs for Aston Villa at the beginning of last season.</p>
      <p>Three goals and two assists in the top flight this season suggests his attacking output is not limited to the international stage.</p>
      <h3>RW - Ryan Fraser</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article20861601.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_8302182.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: SNS Group 0141 221 3602)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Former Aberdeen winger Fraser hasn't quite returned to the heights he hit during last season, when only Eden Hazard bettered his 14 league assists, but he nonetheless remains a valuable player for Eddie Howe's side - and a steal at the £400k they paid to secure his services in 2013.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen may be about to profit further as they have a 20% sell-on clause, with Liverpool continuing to be linked with a move for the 25-year-old.</p>
      <h3>CF - Teemu Pukki</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3898451.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS42483988.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Finnish striker never quite got it going during his time at Celtic Park before being shipped out to Denmark, but he returned to the UK to storm the Championship with 29 goals that sealed the title for Norwich last season.</p>
      <p>His Premier League bow started with a bang, as he netted six in his first five - but he hasn't found the net since.</p>
      <h3>LW - James Maddison</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13116839.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_13201313.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: SNS Group)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While on loan at Aberdeen for the first half of the 2016/17 season, there were more than a few hints that there was an unbelievable player in Maddison - <i>that</i> free-kick winner against Rangers arguably the pinnacle.</p>
      <p>Since returning south, he's gone on to star for both the Canaries and more recently Leicester - where he's scored 13 and assisted nine in 51 appearances.</p>
