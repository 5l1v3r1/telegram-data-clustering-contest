      <p>Mourinho was appointed manager of Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday morning following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino the evening before.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese endured a difficult third season at Old Trafford, which resulted in a exit in December last year following a 3-1 loss to rivals Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"When it's like this, you like Jose coming back," Solskjaer, as per Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be a spectacle and a circus and Nemanja has a sense of humour."</p>
      <p>Pochettino was heavily linked with a move to United when Mourinho was sacked, but Solskjaer insists he is not worried about his job with the Argentine now a free agent.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't bother me at all because I've got the best job in the world.</p>
      <p>"I am sure if you are in or out of a job and you are a manager, you would want this job, so it doesn't really matter whatever happens around it.</p>
      <p>"I've got to focus on my job at Manchester United and do it as well as I can. I speak with Ed (Woodward) and the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward.</p>
      <p>"That doesn't change if some other clubs change their managers."</p>
