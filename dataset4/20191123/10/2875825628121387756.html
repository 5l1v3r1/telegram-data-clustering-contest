      <h1>Romelu Lukaku picks out moment he knew Man Utd career was over</h1>
      <h2>Striker Romelu Lukaku only scored six Premier League goals after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho as Man Utd manager before he joined Inter Milan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:07:06+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku has admitted that he knew that his time at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> was over after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shifted him out to the wing.</p>
      <p>Belgium international Lukaku was first pushed out to a wide position after Norwegian Solskjaer took over from Jose Mourinho in December.</p>
      <p>He was utilised on the wing during January's FA Cup tie with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and February's Premier League clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> - where he moved to the flanks after a knock to Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p>Lukaku scored nine goals under Solskjaer, with only six of those coming in the league, before he moved to Inter Milan for £74million this summer.</p>

      <p>And the 26-year-old, who has already bagged nine times in Serie A, has revealed that he knew his time was up at United when his position changed.</p>
      <p>"Once I learned that [Ole Gunnar] Solsjkaer planned to put me on the wing, then I knew my time at Manchester United was over," Lukaku told Corriere dello Sport, <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146756/lukaku-dreamed-inter-some-time">via Football Italia.</a></p>
      <p>At the time, Lukaku was much less negative about the move, saying in February: "Left or right or up front it doesn’t matter to me. Playing for this club is an honour and I just try to do my best in whichever position I play in.</p>

      <p>"If it is on the right then I will try to create chances, which I did against Liverpool, and if it is up front then I will try to score goals. At the end of the day I just try and help my teammates out and try win matches."</p>
      <p>Lukaku replaced Argentina star Mauro Icardi at the San Siro - but he insists he didn't feel any additional pressure to replicate his goals.</p>
      <p>"I don't mind being the most expensive player in Inter's history, nor replacing Icardi, who give a lot here in Milan," Lukaku said. "When I arrived, Mauro was very nice and kind to me. I wish him all the best at Paris-Saint Germain and hope he wins there. We are two different forwards.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice to be Capocannoniere, but I'm not the type of player who says I want this or that individual title. I think of the team first. My biggest motivation is helping the team, and to help the team we score goals.</p>
      <p>"So far everything has been fine, but I want to do better by working to the maximum every day in training. Now I'm at 100%, but I don't stop, I want to show Inter that they decided well in signing me.</p>
      <p>"I've dreamed of Inter for some time. I loved Ronaldo and Adriano, but it was Ibra that taught me everything, especially in our talks on the team bus. I believe he will return to Serie A."</p>
