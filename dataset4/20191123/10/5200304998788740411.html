      <p>Anu Malik’s exit from ‘Indian Idol 11’ has been a voluntary decision. The temporary three-week break was requested by him to clear his name from the sexual harassment and predatory behaviour allegations made by several singers including Sona Mohapatra, Shweta Pandit, Alisha Chinai and Neha Bhasin.</p>
      <p>“I walked up to Sony and I told them that because of these idiotic, horrible, malicious things that you will read on Twitter, how will you work? I told them to give me a three-week break and they said ok. Let me clear my name and come back. I don’t want to say anything further,” Malik told <i>PTI</i>. “I have written a letter to the Music Composers’ Association of India (MCAI) and I have told them to send the letter to the singers association, asking these girls to show evidence against me and where I have gone wrong. What are you saying and why are you saying this?”</p>
      <p>Ashish Rego, general secretary of MCAI, shared “We have received a letter from Mr Anu Malik four to five days back. In the letter he has said that he be allowed an opportunity to present his side. What is present on social media is one side of the story.” MCAI has scheduled a meeting on Saturday to decide how to proceed on this matter.</p>
