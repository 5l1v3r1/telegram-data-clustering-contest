      <p>We have today received many tips from our readers about Nokia smartphones including Nokia 3.2, 5, 6, 6.1, 5.1 Plus receiving the Google Assistant’s Ambient mode feature in India. You can check for the feature availability by going to Settings–&gt;Google–&gt;Account services–&gt;Search, Assistant &amp; Voice–&gt;Google Assistant–&gt;Assistant–&gt;Scroll down to Assitant devices–&gt;Phone.</p>
      <p>While Nokia 6.2 and 7.2 launched with the Google Assistant’s Ambient mode as <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/google-assistants-ambient-mode-exclusive-to-nokia-6-2-7-2-for-some-time-did-you-try-this/">an exclusive feature </a>, it was surprisingly unavailable on even these two devices in India. But readers from other markets <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/many-nokia-smartphones-getting-google-assistants-ambient-mode-now/">started reporting</a> that they were now able to use “Ambient mode” on their Nokia smartphones in what looked like a sever-side roll-out of the feature by Google. So, seems that Google has finally made it available in India too.</p>
      <p>Google describes Ambient Mode as a new visual overview that gets triggered when devices are plugged in. The Ambient Mode makes it easier to see notifications and reminders, start a playlist and control smart home devices on the lock screen of your Nokia smartphone.</p>
      <blockquote>While your mobile device is charging on a nightstand, living room table, or kitchen counter, it can still help you stay on top of your day. Google Assistant’s Ambient Mode is a new visual overview that makes it easier to see notifications and reminders, start a playlist and control smart home devices on the lockscreen of your device.<br/><br/>When you’re done, your screen will turn into a personal digital photo frame linked to your Google Photos account to add another personal touch. Ambient Mode will be available on the upcoming Lenovo™ Smart Tab M8 HD (when placed in its smart charging station) and Lenovo Yoga™ Smart Tab (when you pop out its handy kickstand), as well as when you start charging your new Nokia 7.2 and 6.2.</blockquote>
