      <p>Ryan Bushman and his children brushed away the dry grass to uncover a weathered mauve-colored grave marker at Trice Hill Cemetery.</p>
      <p>The three used a smartphone to take a picture of the marker, and they also recorded the name of the deceased, along with her birth and death dates.</p>
      <p>The Bushmans didn't know the woman whose grave they had uncovered, but they knew the information inscribed on her marker would be cherished by someone.</p>
      <p>The family was among 200 volunteers who spread out across the metro area to help preserve such troves of information for families, genealogists and historians.</p>
      <p>They took part in the Oklahoma City Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' "Save A Cemetery" project in partnership with other Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints groups, the Interfaith Alliance of Oklahoma and The Coltrane Group.</p>
      <p>Peter Adams, public affairs director for the Oklahoma City Latter-day Saints, said volunteers were able to capture information from about 4,000 headstones as part of the Nov. 16 project. Most volunteers met at Trice Hill, 5101 N Coltrane Road, a predominantly black cemetery, while others gathered information at Oakland Cemetery in Canadian County, and cemeteries in Bethany and Moore.</p>
      <p>Groups worked to digitize sections of the burial grounds for the BillionGraves mobile application. BillionGraves describes itself as the largest resource for searchable GPS cemetery data to make such data easily accessible to people around the world.</p>
      <p>The goal of the project was simple: "Find a grave, take a picture, record a life." Volunteers did just that by taking pictures of headstones and transcribing the information on the markers. Both the pictures of the headstones and the transcribed information were downloaded on the app.</p>
      <p>"This is kind of awesome," Ryan Bushman said as he transcribed information with help from his son, Cannon, and daughter Rachel. The family is part of the Oklahoma City Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Our common humanity'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adams and the volunteers were especially proud of the interfaith aspect of the project.</p>
      <p>Toward the end of the project, volunteers gathered around and partnered with a person of a different faith to talk briefly about what the graveyard meant to them and how the project's premise fit with their faith beliefs and worldview.</p>
      <p>Afterward, Verbus Counts, of Edmond, who attends the Edmond Baha'i Faith Center, said he enjoyed taking part in the project.</p>
      <p>"The idea is great because so much history, especially African-American history, gets lost because we don't have records," he said.</p>
      <p>Julian Hilliard, an Oklahoma City Community College professor, participated in the project as part of the Interfaith Alliance's Many Beliefs Serving Together group. Hilliard, who said he has no faith beliefs, brought 11 of his college students to participate in the project.</p>
      <p>He said the Interfaith Alliance joined in the project because the information gleaned from the BillionGraves app is made available to the public for free.</p>
      <p>"What really attracted me is that this is information that will be freely available," he said. "We're all related by our common humanity. That's what the Interfaith Alliance is all about. We have things in common even if our beliefs are different."</p>
      <p>Grant Lyon and Andre Head, an Oklahoma City genealogist and historian, said they particularly enjoyed seeing the project come to fruition.</p>
      <p>Lyon spearheaded a similar project over the past summer as part of his Eagle Scout project with Scouts BSA Troop 0314, which is affiliated with the Oklahoma City Latter-day Saints. Adams paired Lyon with Head, co-founder of The Coltrane Group and president of the Black Genealogy Research Group, who recommended that Lyon and his volunteers turn their attention to Trice Hill.</p>
      <p>Lyon's group captured information from about 1,000 headstones on the west side of the burial groups so he was pleased to see the large group of volunteers gather even more information at the Nov. 16 event.</p>
      <p>"I think this is super awesome. We've been able to get so many more headstones done," he said.</p>
