      <p>Jose Mourinho will kick off life as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> manager with a trip to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a> in the Premier League for what promises to be a fiery London derby on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Spurs supporters will be desperate to see the 56-year-old's arrival galvanise their players ahead of a potentially tricky meeting with Manuel Pellegrini's side.</p>
      <h3>We say: West Ham United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur</h3>
      <p>The boost that Mourinho's arrival gives to any group will be there to see on Saturday, as Spurs head to East London deeply determined to produce a performance of unswerving discipline.</p>
      <p>Against a side that is currently experiencing a poor patch of form, this galvanised mindset will play a decisive role, handing Spurs a much-needed first away win in the league since January.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> will be looking to win in the Premier League for the first time since the start of October when they welcome <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are without a victory in their last four in the top flight, which has left them in sixth spot in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">the table</a> ahead of this weekend's clash with a Southampton side currently in the relegation zone.</p>
      <h3>We say: Arsenal 3-1 Southampton</h3>
      <p>Arsenal's form in recent weeks has been patchy at absolute best, but it is difficult to predict anything other than a home victory this weekend when taking everything into consideration. We fancy the Gunners to run out comfortable winners in front of their own supporters, who will be demanding a response.</p>

      <p>Bournemouth play host to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/wolves/"><b>Wolverhampton Wanderers</b></a> in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon having put together a four-match unbeaten streak at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>However, Nuno Espirito Santo's team make the trip to the south coast having avoided defeat in each of their last four away fixtures in the top flight.</p>
      <h3>We say: Bournemouth 2-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers</h3>
      <p>While we are expecting a closely-fought encounter at the Vitality Stadium, we feel that Bournemouth will be fresher with their players having done less travelling during the international break. With that in mind, we are predicting a narrow victory for the Cherries.</p>

      <p>However, the Seagulls welcome the East Midlands outfit having recorded victories in each of their last three home matches in the top flight.</p>
      <h3>We say: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1-2 Leicester City</h3>
      <p>While Brighton will be confident of earning at least a share of the spoils on the south coast, we cannot back against a Leicester team who are showing both flair and resolve in their bid to remain as the closest challengers to leaders <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a>.</p>

      <p>Liverpool arrive back from the final international break of the calendar year in the enviable position of sitting eight points clear at the top of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League table</a> heading into Saturday's clash with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side have dropped just two points from the 36 on offer so far this season and will be looking to continue that remarkable form against a Palace side winless in four games.</p>
      <h3>We say: Crystal Palace 0-2 Liverpool</h3>
      <p>Crystal Palace's home form has been unconvincing this season, whereas Liverpool just seem to keep on winning. A trip to Selhurst Park is never an easy match, and Liverpool's injury concerns make the task even tougher, but it is difficult to back against Klopp's side on current form. We are predicting Palace to fall to a third consecutive 2-0 home defeat.</p>

      <p>Marco Silva's Toffees are currently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">15th in the table</a>, five places and seven points ahead of their East Anglian opponents.</p>
      <h3>We say: Everton 3-1 Norwich City</h3>
      <p>Norwich's recent form hardly makes for pleasant reading and while there is a good chance that Teemu Pukki will get back among the goals, Everton should have more than enough quality to make it four unbeaten in all competitions.</p>

      <h3>We say: Watford 1-1 Burnley</h3>
      <p>Burnley may be the better side on paper but their struggles away from Turf Moor and Watford's improved form and greater defensive stability in recent weeks should see this one end in a draw.</p>

      <p>While City <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-ruthless-liverpool-overcome-man-city-at-anfield_378576.html">succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Liverpool</a> before the international break, Chelsea make the trip to the North-West having recorded six successive victories in the top flight.</p>
      <h3>We say: Manchester City 4-1 Chelsea</h3>
      <p>Chelsea will be full of confidence ahead of taking on Guardiola's men, but City are motivated to produce a clinical response after falling short at Anfield. While the visitors could make an impact in the final third, we feel that they could be overpowered at the opposite end of the pitch.</p>

      <p>United did win last time out against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/man-utd-vs-brighton-and-hove-albion_game_92619.html">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion by a 3-1 scoreline</a>, but the newly-promoted Blades have claimed five points from their four meetings with the Premier League's 'big six' this season and will not be rolled over.</p>
      <h3>We say: Sheffield United 1-1 Manchester United</h3>
      <p>The Blades are a stubborn outfit and will prove a tough test for Manchester United, who will certainly not feel confident of claiming a point at Bramall Lane. The absence of Henderson may make things tricky for the hosts, but their organisation should still prove enough to earn them another impressive point against a top-six opponent.</p>
