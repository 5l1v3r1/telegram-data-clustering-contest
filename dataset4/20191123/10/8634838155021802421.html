      <p>This has been pointed out to posing a serious threat to Kenyans’ health, security and the economy of the country.</p>
      <p>In September 2019, ACA destroyed an assortment of fake goods worth Ksh5 million including cigarettes in Mombasa.</p>
      <p>“We at ACA want to further open up to the private sectors to assist in law enforcement and consumer awareness programmes to cut the demand side of counterfeiting,'' remarked ACA Chairperson Flora Mutahi.</p>
