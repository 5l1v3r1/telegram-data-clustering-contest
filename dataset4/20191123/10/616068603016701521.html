      <p>Canada's biggest railway says temporary layoffs are likely at the Halifax port due to an ongoing strike by its workers.</p>
      <p>Canadian National Railway Co. says inactivity at the port means some rail employees will likely be placed on furlough if the labour stoppage — now in its fifth day — continues.</p>
      <p>Workers at other ports may also be vulnerable to temporary layoffs as the railway runs at 10 per cent capacity.</p>
      <p>Last week CN confirmed job cuts as it deals with a weakening North American economy that has eroded demand for railroad transportation, with a company source acknowledging 1,600 employees will be laid off from union and management positions.</p>
      <p>About 3,200 CN rail workers, who have been without a contract since July 23, walked off the job early Tuesday morning over worries about long hours, fatigue and what they consider dangerous working conditions.</p>
      <p>The federal government has faced mounting pressure to resolve the strike as premiers and industry voice concerns about lost profits and a propane shortage in Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes.</p>
      <p>Though the striking rail workers are part of the Teamsters union, the potential furloughs in Halifax would affect Unifor members.</p>
      <p>The union did not immediately respond to request for comment on the furloughs.</p>
