      <p>Officers out on patrol stopped a vehicle after it was adapted to make 'police-like noises'.</p>
      <p>Special constables in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/gedling">Gedling</a> posted to Twitter that a vehicle had been stopped on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>They reported the 'sirens' were removed and the person responsible was 'dealt with'.</p>
      <p>The tweet from Notts Police Specials read: "Stopped: Our Gedling Specials have just identified and stopped a vehicle which was adapted to make police-like noises.</p>
      <p>"Safe to say that the person responsible has been dealt with and the ‘sirens’ removed from the vehicle."</p>
      <p>Special constables (or "Specials") are volunteer police officers with the same powers as regular officers.</p>
