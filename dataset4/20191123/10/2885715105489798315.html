      <p>Bollywood comedy Pagalpanti opened with Rs 4.75 crore on its opening day, according to Bollywood Hungama. The Anees Bazmee directorial stars Anil Kapoor, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-abraham/">John Abraham</a>, Ileana D’Cruz, Arshad Warsi, Urvashi Rautela, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/pulkit-samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a>, Kriti Kharbanda and Saurabh Shukla.</p>
      <p>Trade analyst Girish Johar had projected the film’s first-day total to be around Rs 9 to 10 crore.</p>
      <p>Johar told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">Indianexpress.com</a> earlier, “Pagalpanti is a quirky family comedy directed by Anees Bazmee. It has an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Pulkit Samrat and Arshad Warsi among others supporting it. All the actors, with their fan following, have the power to pull the audience to the theaters.”</p>
      <p>He added, “The film looks like a clean commercial comedy. After a long time, a film has come where you can keep your brains out and just enjoy some time with your family. The trailer is also being liked and songs have created awareness among the audience. So, I think Pagalpanti should open at around Rs 9-10 crore. It will probably have a good weekend at the box office.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> film critic Shalini Langer gave the film zero stars. Shalini wrote, “Most of the time it wants us to cheer for three grown men — Abraham (really bad), Warsi (passable), Samrat (unbearable) — deemed unlucky by a pandit (who wears suits and drives a car, in concession for this being London), who fail at everything they venture into. Along the way, the three defraud Sanjana (D’Cruz) and her mama, and soon after, land work at another don’s castle. Essentially they are guinea pigs for this don (Shukla), in his bid to fend off murderous plots planned by rivals. There is dancing, romancing, racing, blasting, and car chasing. There are names like Raja, WiFi (Kapoor), Tullie and Bullie. Men behave like children, women like brainless children dressed in ridiculous clothes (Raja’s daughter played by Kharbanda is officially dismissed as dim-witted).”</p>
      <p>She added, “Among the much too many Indians around in London and the English countryside, there are plenty of white faces in the backdrop, getting kicked around.”</p>
