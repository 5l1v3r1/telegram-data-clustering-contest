      <p>Manchester City host top-four rivals Chelsea in a mouthwatering Premier League tussle this weekend.</p>
      <p>It has been a long two weeks for Pep Guardiola, left to stew on City's defeat to leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , while his players were away on international duty.</p>
      <p>The 3-1 loss at Anfield left City in fourth place, trailing Jurgen Klopp's side by nine points with little room for further error.</p>
      <p>The increased pressure can be felt heading into Saturday's return to action when in-form <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> visit the Etihad, buzzing with youthful confidence after a run of six straight victories in the league.</p>
      <p>Chelsea manager Frank Lampard, who ended his Premier League career with a season at City, has won plaudits for the way he has got the best out of home-grown players.</p>
