      <p>Borderlands 3 will be receiving its first full campaign DLC next month. Based on the trailer, it’s going to be a homage to the antagonist of the second Borderlands title, Handsome Jack.</p>
      <p>The DLC campaign is titled Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot and according to the synopsis, the DLC’s theme revolves around a casino heist; as per the DLC’s title, the casino is called the Handsome Jackpot. Originally a dream project of Moxxi’s, Handsome Jack spitefully stole the deed and rights to the casino from her. When the two characters decided to split up.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the casino went into lockdown immediately after the death of Handsome Jack, leaving the unfortunate souls who were inside at the time both trapped and to their own devices. So, in true Borderlands style, Gearbox Software wants you to shoot your way through to whatever treasure lies at the end of the proverbial rainbow.</p>
