      <h1>The Men’s Cardigan Makes a Comeback</h1>

      <p>Paternal. Sexless. Infinitely square. The cardigan sweater is generally considered the Mister Rogers of men’s wear, and for good reason: <a href="https://www.misterrogers.org/about-fred-rogers/">Fred Rogers</a> made sure of it.</p>
      <p>Over the course of 895 episodes and 33 years of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” Mister Rogers advertised his gentle, nonthreatening nature by slipping from a jacket and tie — symbols of the messy, scary adult professional world — into a humble knit zip-up that was homely both in the British definition (“Simple but cozy and comfortable, as in one’s own home”) and the American (I mean, yikes).</p>
      <p>Mister Rogers’s many, colorful cardigans — one of which is now in the <a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/snapshot/hi-neighbor">Smithsonian</a> — were originally knitted by Mr. Rogers’s mother, Nancy McFeely Rogers. According to a recent article on <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/behind-scenes-quest-find-mister-rogers-signature-cardigans-180973283/">Smithsonian.com</a>, she made a new one for her famous son every Christmas (a McTouchy McFeely detail if there ever was one).</p>
      <p>After she died in 1981, the show’s art director looked to that bastion of saucy style, the United States Postal Service, for inspiration, relying on hand-dyed versions of mail-carrier cardigans.</p>
      <p>Fashion, of course, was not the point. Mister Rogers’s talismanic cardigan, which is faithfully <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/tom-hanks-sweaters-for-mr-rogers-movie-took-9-weeks-to-knit/">recreated </a><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/tom-hanks-sweaters-for-mr-rogers-movie-took-9-weeks-to-knit/">by </a><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/tom-hanks-sweaters-for-mr-rogers-movie-took-9-weeks-to-knit/">Yasemin Esmeck</a> for the new film <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/movies/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review.html?module=inline">“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,”</a> starring Tom Hanks, was the sartorial equivalent of a lullaby — sweet, comforting, bland — and it helped lull generations of American preschoolers into the cozy <a href="https://www.misterrogers.org/articles/the-neighborhood-of-make-believe/">Neighborhood of Make-Believe</a>, where there are no bad people and no bad thoughts.</p>
      <p>This worked well for children, but did no favors for the sweater itself, helping brand the cardigan — any cardigan — as doofuswear, the male equivalent of a chastity belt. (Likewise considered slightly sorority sister for women, it got a power boost after <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/05/14/477926313/mrs-obama-saves-the-cardigan-the-obama-effect-in-fashion">being worn by Michelle Obama for, among other occasions, drinks with the Queen of England.)</a></p>
      <p>It wasn’t all Mr. Rogers’s fault. Unlike the standard form-fitting pullover, many midcentury male cardigans artfully hid the male physique inside a woolly tomb with the contours of a sleeping bag. Generally speaking, this was comfort clothing, designed to steer men toward the den, not the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Lingering associations with sitcom dads (think Ward Cleaver) and lettermen sweaters of the Pat Boone ’50s (sis-boom-blah) only underscored the point: The cardigan was a buttoned-up sweater for a buttoned-up era. Would it ever recover?</p>
      <p>Lately, there are signs.</p>
      <p>Searches for men’s cardigans on <a href="https://poshmark.com/">Poshmark</a>, a fashion resale site, spiked 79 percent since the Tom Hanks film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in early September, as <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/mr-rogers-kurt-cobain-cardigans">Rachel Tashjian</a> recently reported in GQ.</p>
      <p>Last month, the shabby-chic olive-green cardigan that Kurt Cobain wore for his famous “MTV Unplugged” performance in 1993 made headlines, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/us/kurt-cobain-cardigan-trnd/index.html">selling at auction for $334,000, apparently a record for a sweater.</a></p>
      <p>With thrift-store origins, unkempt mohair fibers and early-’90s stains intact, the Cobain sweater is a fitting rebuttal to the Rogers cardigan. A symbol of shaggy punk nihilism, it is the knitwear equivalent of a power chord loud enough to scare the meow-meow out of Henrietta Pussycat.</p>
      <p>The bad-boy potential of the cardigan is also on full display in HBO’s “Succession,” in which Logan Roy, the dark-lord media mogul played by Brian Cox, has made the avuncular <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/succession-logan-roy-shawl-cardigan.html">shawl cardigan</a> the uniform for his weekly adventures in corporate mayhem and subterfuge.</p>
      <p>Outfitting an assassin of the C-suite in an item of apparel typically associated with doting grandfathers and white-haired Irish poets is a mordant costume choice, like slipping an M-80 firecracker into an Easter flower arrangement. Even so, it is hardly the first time anyone has attempted to infuse the cardigan with a little swagger.</p>
      <p>Steve McQueen occasionally <a href="https://bamfstyle.com/2017/09/10/cincinnatikid-cardigan/">rocked a cardigan</a> in the 1960s. Then again, Steve McQueen could rock a scarlet Bozo the Clown wig.</p>
      <p>At the height of the disco era, Paul Michael Glaser of television’s “Starsky &amp; Hutch” injected the cardigan with a dose of street cred. Mr. Glaser’s Starsky looked extremely happening — or at least, extremely ’70s — in <a href="https://www.cozitv.com/video/COZI-Starsky-Sweater-273636211.html">his trademark south-of-the-border shawl cardigan</a>, which was, if nothing else, less risible than the cop duo’s red Ford Gran Torino with the faux-Nike white swoop.</p>
      <p>Sadly for Mr. Glaser, Jeff Bridges undid much of his hard work two decades later, with his Dude character in “The Big Lebowski” seizing on a similar sofa-throwish cardigan — also known as the <a href="https://www.pendleton-usa.com/the-orginal-westerley-cardigan.html">Westerley cardigan, by Pendleton</a> — as a signifier of sunbaked, aging-hipster dissolution. You could practically smell the bong water seeping through its fibers.</p>
      <p>In the years since, countless male celebrities have made game attempts to rescue the cardigan from Mister Rogers’s closet and make it <a href="https://www.gq.com/gallery/iconic-cardigan-looks">safe for the red carpet</a>: David Beckham, Pharrell Williams, Daniel Craig. As 007, Mr. Craig even managed to make a Tom Ford <a href="https://www.bondsuits.com/the-shawl-collar-cardigan-in-quantum-of-solace/">black shawl-collar cardigan</a> look menacing in the 2008 James Bond film, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/movies/14quan.html?module=inline">“Quantum of Solace.”</a></p>
      <p>The takeaway? The cardigan is as every bit as bad as you make it.</p>
