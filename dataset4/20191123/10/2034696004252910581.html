      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> has said that he wants to fight “bully” <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a>, while also showing his admiration for the former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> star.</p>
      <p>Williams <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-reignites-long-running-feud-with-liam-gallagher-2565575">reignited his widely-reported rift with Gallagher earlier this month</a>, telling him to “buy yourself a pair of bollocks” after the ‘Wall Of Glass’ singer said he had “big fuck off fish to fry”.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10397966/robbie-williams-cat-dying-change/"><i>The Sun</i></a>, Williams has now praised Gallagher for his individuality within the music industry – though he’s not prepared to let bygones be bygones just yet.</p>
      <p>“I admire [Gallagher]. He is the voice of a generation, the last of a dying breed, as pop stars are so boring these days,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But I still want to fight him. He represents a school bully to me and I would like to take the bully down.”</p>
      <p>Williams also spoke of how his relationship with former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/take-that">Take That</a> bandmate <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/gary-barlow">Gary Barlow</a> is similar to that of the estranged Gallagher brothers.</p>

      <p>Liam Gallagher and Robbie Williams</p>
      <p>“We had a sibling rivalry. We were the original Liam and Noel,” Williams said, explaining that he was “obsessed by getting even with people” during his younger years.</p>
      <p>Williams and Gallagher were friends back in the ’90s but came to loggerheads on a number of occasions, including when Williams challenged Gallagher to a fight during the 2000 Brit Awards.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Gallagher labelled Williams a “fat fucking idiot” when the latter was given the opportunity to perform at a bigger venue in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/liam-gallagher-accused-noel-trying-shut-twitter-account-2569269#zBshPiZuKy34BdSd.99">Liam Gallagher has accused his brother Noel of trying to shut down his Twitter account</a> as the feud between the two estranged brothers continues.</p>
