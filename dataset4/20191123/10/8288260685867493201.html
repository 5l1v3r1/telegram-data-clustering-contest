      <p>A family have shamed a popular city cinema at a Birmingham multiplex after they were forced clean their own seats.</p>
      <p>Litter, popcorn and empty cups were left strewn across a cinema screen at Star City's Vue Cinema on Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p>Shocking images capture the mess from previous viewers - which was not cleaned as usual due to a rota blunder, Vue later admitted.</p>
      <p>A 26-year-old, who had gone to see a Punjabi movie with his family, hit out at the cinema, saying they had to clear others' popcorn from their seats.</p>

      <p>The cinema-goer, visiting with his mum and brother, told BirminghamLive: "There were no clean seats.</p>
      <p>"We had to move the popcorn with our own hands. It was all up the stairs."</p>
      <p>The son had spent £15 to see the late showing of Daaka at the leisure complex's cinema.</p>
      <p>But on arrival, they were greeted by popcorn strewn across the floor, seats and stairs.</p>

      <p>Empty bottles still filled the cup holders and litter was seen dumped on every row from the last viewers.</p>
      <p>"We got there about 11.30pm, went to the counter and was waiting 5-6 minutes, so we got our tickets from the machine.</p>
      <p>"We went in about 11.40 - 11.45pm. It was a complete mess. I took pictures and I complained to one of the staff members in the cinema and he apologised. But he didn't say why it happened.</p>
      <p>"While I was at the cinema I emailed Vue. I've tried to phone them but it kept getting disconnected."</p>

      <p>Vue apologised for the state of the cinema and said Screen 10 had been overlooked due to a mix up with the cleaning rota.</p>
      <p>It has since issued the family with three complimentary tickets,</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesperson said: “The images taken at our Star City site clearly don’t meet our high standards of cleanliness.</p>
      <p>"Following a review of the cleaning rota and system in place screen 10 was unfortunately overlooked on this evening.</p>
      <p>"This would normally not occur and management have taken action to ensure this can’t happen again.</p>
      <p>"We would like to apologise to customers who were affected.”</p>
