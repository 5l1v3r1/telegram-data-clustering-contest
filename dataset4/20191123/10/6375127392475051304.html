      <h3>AT least 21 drug rehab centers will get a budget of P1.2 billion for their operations in 2020, a House leader said.</h3>
      <p>Anak Kalusugan Rep. Mike Defensor, chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts, said the funds are included in the proposed budget of the Department of Health (DOH).</p>
      <p>Defensor said the Congress considers the needed budget of the 21 public residential drug treatment and rehabilitation centers as part of the anti-drug campaign of the administration.</p>
      <p>These are Bicutan Rehabilitation Center (P171 million); Las Piñas Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million); Dagupan Rehabilitation Center (P86 million); San Fernando, La Union Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million); Isabela Rehabilitation Center (P58 million); Central Luzon Centers for Health Development (P121 million); Bataan Rehabilitation Center (P57 million); Tagaytay Rehabilitation Center (P91 million); Camarines Sur Rehabilitation Center (P56 million); Malinao, Albay Rehabilitation Center (P55 million); Pototan, Iloilo Rehabilitation Center (P52 million); Argao, Cebu Rehabilitation Center (P68 million); Cebu City Rehabilitation Center (P43 million); Dulag, Leyte Rehabilitation Center (P60 million); Zamboanga City Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million); Cagayan de Oro Rehabilitation Center (P63 million); Malaybalay, Bukidnon Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million); Malagos, Davao Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million); Alabel, Sarangani Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million); CARAGA Rehabilitation Center (P57 million); and San Francisco, Agusan del Sur Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (P12 million).</p>
      <p>A supplemental P55 million for the operations of the centers would also be available at the DOH’s central office, Defensor said.</p>
      <p>“At present, drug abusers, with the help of their families, may voluntarily seek admission to any of these centers. Or they may be compelled to seek treatment in these centers,” Defensor added.</p>
      <p>Under the law, Defensor said families have the option to petition for the compulsory rehabilitation of a member who is a known drug abuser.</p>
      <p>Defensor said drug abusers caught possessing small quantities of illegal drugs may also be subjected to compulsory rehabilitation in lieu of a jail term.</p>
      <p>The solon said that while they undergo compulsory treatment for not more than six months, their jail sentences may be suspended by a trial judge.</p>
      <p>Defensor earlier urged Vice President Leni Robredo, the country’s new anti-drug czar, “to concentrate on suppressing the demand side of the drug problem by sending as many abusers as possible to compulsory treatment.”</p>
      <p>The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, with the help of other agencies, is presumed to be already forcefully addressing the supply side of the drug problem by running after big-time traffickers.</p>
