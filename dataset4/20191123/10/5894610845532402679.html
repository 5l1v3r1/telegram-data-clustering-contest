      <p>The heartbroken mother of Danny McGee (21) from Longford who died after a fatal assault in New York last year said that “just one punch” ended the life of someone who had so much to look forward to.</p>
      <p>Steven O’Brien (26) from Dublin, pleaded guilty to the assault charge in Queens County Criminal Court on Thursday and will serve six months in prison.</p>
      <p>He is to be formally sentenced on January 8 after being released on continuing bail.</p>
      <p>Mr McGee, originally from Drumlish, was found lying unresponsive outside of a bar in Queens shortly before 4am on November 22 last year.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital and later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast this morning, his mother Colleen McGee said that the family was heartbroken by Danny’s untimely death.</p>
      <p>“We’re heartbroken, he was an older and younger brother.</p>
      <p>“We all missed him so much when he was away and he was going to return home in February.”</p>
      <p>She paid tribute to her son and said that he was a “larger than life” person.</p>
      <p>“He was a larger than life character, he was extremely entertaining,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He was a great kid, he loved nothing more than going out with his friends for a night.</p>
      <p>“He made friends everywhere he went, children loved him, older people loved him. He had friends everywhere,” she said.</p>
      <p>Danny had attended college for a year but after finding that “it wasn’t for him”, he went to New York in September 2017.</p>
      <p>A little over a year since he first arrived in New York, Ms McGee remembered gardaí coming to her door on the night of November 22 2018, the day that he died.</p>

      <p>“I was home on that evening,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The guards came to my door, asked me if I was Colleen and the first thing I said was, ‘Please don’t tell me something has happened to my son’.</p>
      <p>“They came in and told me what had happened,” she added.</p>
      <p>She said that while she isn’t sure what exactly happened outside of the bar, she said that “there was a punch thrown and that was it”.</p>
      <p>Ms McGee added that his death should serve as a warning to other young men.</p>
      <p>“If you get involved in a heated situation, please just walk away. And in the heat of the moment, I don’t really know what happened, but one punch ended a young life, he had so much to look forward to,” she added.</p>
      <p>A tribute mass arranged by the Longford Association of New York will take place later on today and a remembrance mass will also take place in Drumlish, Longford, on December 14.</p>
