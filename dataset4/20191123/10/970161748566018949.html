      <h1>I'm A Celebrity will suffer by ignoring YouTube generation after Jack Maynard</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:23:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/louise-griffin/" target="_blank">Louise Griffin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here looked all set to be a pioneer for the digital world in mainstream TV back in 2017.</p>
      <p>Jack Maynard, a well-loved member of the YouTube community, was booked, and jetted off to the Australian jungle. And then things rapidly went horribly wrong.</p>
      <p>TV history was made when the YouTuber left the jungle just two days into the show after racist and homophobic tweets were unearthed. After quickly making his departure, he uploaded the inevitable apology video, with the whole drama blowing over by the end of the series.</p>
      <p>But it’s had a huge impact on the legacy of the show, indirectly leading to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/roman-kemp-apologises-abusive-social-media-posts-ahead-im-celeb-stint-im-utterly-sorry-11069831/">bizarre situations like </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/roman-kemp-apologises-abusive-social-media-posts-ahead-im-celeb-stint-im-utterly-sorry-11069831/"> apologising for all his old tweets in advance</a> (presumably before anyone can find them), and the show giving us a big old tumbleweed on the YouTuber front ever since.</p>

      <p>Now, there could be any number of reasons why the show has stayed well away from the digital generation since the Great YouTuber Drama of 2017. But it’s certainly not going to do them any favours.</p>
      <p>Take Strictly for example – in 2018, the show took a chance on one of the UK’s most beloved social stars, Joe Sugg. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/14/former-strictly-come-dancing-pro-robin-windsor-no-idea-new-contestant-joe-sugg-7839213/">After feathers were inevitably ruffled</a>, the internet’s answer to Billy Elliot charmed the nation after reaching the final, and is still going strong.</p>
      <p>While Saffron Barker’s success on the show is yet to be determined, she’s also undoubtedly brought a huge amount of new viewers to the show – a win on any front.</p>

      <p>As a result, Strictly’s ended up being the real pioneer of the digital age, with viewers flocking to see their favourite YouTuber hit the dance floor.</p>
      <p>As for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/im-celebrity-2019-line-start-11070107/">I’m A Celebrity line-up over the past couple of years</a>, it’s undeniably a bit dry.</p>
      <p>Aside from Caitlyn Jenner, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-face-huge-fines-exposing-kardashian-family-secrets-11194080/">who admittedly could be set to spill KarJenner gossip galore</a>, we’re left with two sportsmen, two radio DJs, two singers, three soap stars – and Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>Even Caitlyn wasn’t afraid to throw some shade <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-apologises-throws-shade-soap-stars-andy-whyment-cliff-parisi-11198083/">at the absolute army of soap stars taking over the camp this year</a>, with her ‘What’s the deal with all these f***ing soap people?’</p>

      <p>That’s definitely not to say this year’s squad won’t be entertaining. After all, we’ve already had our fair share of camp bants, rows, and emotions running high.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But, at some point, the show is going to have to liven up their pool of celebs. And if there’s anyone who can do drama, laughter, and tears, it’s a YouTuber.</p>
      <p>So who do we propose should take on the task of repping Team Internet in years to come? So glad you asked.</p>

      <p>Alfie Deyes, Jim Chapman, and Tanya Burr are all obvious choices to begin with. As YouTube OGs, they’ve proven they’ve got the metal to stay relevant over a number of years, and they’re definitely not short of entertainment value.</p>
      <p>After<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksi-triumphs-logan-paul-boxing-rematch-fierce-fight-11068044/"> KSI’s fight with Logan Paul this year,</a> he’s also proven he’s made of strong stuff – and there’s no doubt he could bring in the viewers after stirring up the world of boxing. Plus, he’s already got the bandana look down. What more do you need?</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>There are countless choices of people who could cause a bit of chaos in the I’m A Celebrity camp.</p>
      <p>Even if the show decides against it in years to come, it’s surely only a matter of time before the YouTube community takes things into their own hands and airs their own version instead.</p>
      <p>Just know, if you’re blessed with KSI and Logan Paul being stuck in a jungle together with nowhere to escape, you’ve got us to thank.</p>
