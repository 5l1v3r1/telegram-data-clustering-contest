        <b>Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga joined a host of Jubilee leaders who attended a thanksgiving ceremony organised by McDonald Mariga at The Bomas of Kenya on November 22, 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The vocal senator thanked Kibra residents for the love and support they showed during the November 7 by-election, despite the chaos Deputy President William Ruto alleged was orchestrated by ODM leader Raila Odinga.</p>
      <p>"Today I would like to thank the men, women, and youth of Kibra for showing us much love when we sought votes for Mariga. We know what happened on November 7, our people were intimidated and others were injured." Omanga spoke.</p>

      <p>However, Omanga called out the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party and issued a warning over the fracas that was witnessed in Kibra.</p>
      <p>"What I would like to inform you is that ODM has no monopoly over violence. We went into the election thinking it would be peaceful, and that is why we did not cause any fracas or retaliate," she remarked.</p>
      <p>"The journey to 2022 has now begun, those we campaigned with here in Kibra and others not from here, will form William Ruto's army in 2022. We will offer tight security, <i>sisi ndio tutakua na hizo 'bundee'</i> 2022," she added.</p>
      <p>Omanga's remarks were prompted by the alleged violence that occurred during the campaign period in Kibra during the election.</p>
      <p>She called upon the residents to rise up and rally against the opposition in a bid to aid DP Ruto's 2022 bid and for Mariga to clinch the Kibra seat in 2022.</p>

      <p>Kimilili MP Didymus Barasa joined Omanga in sending a warning to the ODM Party. He cautioned that he would not hold back in 2022.</p>
      <p>"I want to tell Raila that if he wants to cause chaos in 2022, the person he will be up against is Didmus Barasa and Nickson Korir here," he spoke.</p>
