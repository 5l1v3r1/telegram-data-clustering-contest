      <h3>BONGABON, Nueva Ecija – Acting on an information provided by two surrendered New People’s Army rebels, the police and the military raided a suspected arms “depot” here on Friday and recovered two high-powered firearms with several rounds of ammunition, including wires that are believed used as detonating cords, a major component in the making of improvised explosive device.</h3>
      <p>Lt. Col. Dennis Wenceslao, provincial mobile force company commander said his men and members of the 91st Infantry Battalion under Lt. Col. Jose Mari Torrenueva swooped down on the said suspected NPA rebel lair in Bgy. Labi at 1:30 p.m. based on a tip given by two rebels who surrendered to the government on Nov. 21 here.</p>

      <p>Wenceslao said the raid was conducted after two surrendered rebels, identified as alias Ninoy, 24, vice commander of the KLG-Sierra Madre Platun dos, and alias Megan, squad medic of said front, both of Bgy. Catacte, Bustos, Bulacan, squealed to the authorities the location of the said arms cache.</p>
