      <h3>POLICE seized around 40-grams of shabu placed in a monkey stuffed toy with an estimated street value of P275,400 from a jobless man and his live-in partner in a buy-bust operation before dawn yesterday in Pasay City.</h3>
      <p>Pasay city police chief P/Col. Bernard Yang identified the arrested suspects as Bienvenido Rensales, 52, and Jocelyn Guillen, 26, both of 166 Twin Pioneer, Don Carlos, Bgy. 148 Zone 16 who were allegedly considered as high value targets.</p>
      <p>Col. Yang said elements of Station Drug Enforcement Unit (SDEU), led by P/Capt. Deni Mari Pedrozo conducted a buy-bust operation against the two at around 1 a.m. inside their house which is allegedly being used as drug den after more than a week of surveillance operation.</p>
      <p>When Rensales handed the plastic sachet of shabu to a police poseur-buyer in exchange for P500 marked money, the latter gave the pre-arranged signal prompting elements of SDEU  to swoop down on the house.</p>
      <p>Recovered from the suspects were nine medium sized plastic sachets containing shabu, the P500 marked money and several pieces of drug paraphernalia. </p>
