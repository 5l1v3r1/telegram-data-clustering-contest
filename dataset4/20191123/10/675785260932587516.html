      <h1>Peter Andre mysteriously deletes gushing tribute to three-year-old son Theo</h1>
      <h2>The father-of-four took to social media to celebrate Theo's birthday but then destroyed the evidence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:52:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Peter Andre made a gushing post to mark the third birthday of his youngest son - and then promptly deleted all trace of his tribute.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/peter-andre">The 46-year-old Mysterious Girl singer</a> has four children - two with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">glamour model ex-wife Katie Price, 41,</a> and two with current wife, 30-year-old doctor Emily MacDonagh.</p>
      <p>And youngest child Theo turned three-years-old on Friday - with Pete taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to proudly celebrate his son’s big day.</p>
      <p>Pete shared two images for followers to like and admire - with one showing a giant birthday cake made by Emily featuring Toy Story characters, and another image of Theo wearing a backpack.</p>

      <p>“My boy's all grown up. Three today,” the Australian music legend gushed.</p>
      <p>"Happy 3rd birthday my beautiful boy. Love you Theo soooooo much. Cake made by Emily,” he added as he captioned both photos.</p>
      <p>Fans and followers were deeply impressed by Emily’s cake making skills - with many taking to the comments section of the post to remark about her skills.</p>

      <p>"Emily is talented! Happy birthday Theo!" wrote one fan, with another commenting: "Wow Emily you're so talented happy birthday Theo x."</p>
      <p>However, mystery ensued as Peter later deleted the posts - along with all others he had shared over the previous four days.</p>
      <p>Peter and Emily married in 2015 and also have a five-year-old daughter named Amelia.</p>

      <p>While Pete also has a 14-year-old son named Junior Savva Andreas Andre and a 12-year-old daughter, Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre, from his failed marriage to Katie.</p>
      <p>Katie and Pete have endured a long-running fued over the rights to share photos of their shared offspring on social media with each banning the other from using them in their own photos.</p>
      <p>While Emily and Pete appear to keep their two children relatively out of the public eye by rarely sharing photos of either of them.</p>
