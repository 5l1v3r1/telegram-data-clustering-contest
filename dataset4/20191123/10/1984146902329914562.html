      <h1>Revealed: What would-be Newcastle United owner Joseph DaGrosa told executives at Soccerex</h1>
      <h2>It's Newcastle United Notebook time and Joseph DaGrosa, Federico Fernandez, the Wyscout Forum, Monday night football and Floyd Mayweather all feature</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Douglas, Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Would-be Newcastle United owner Joseph DaGrosa told a room full of executives at the Soccerex conference this week that the financial might of the US will ensure the country comes to dominate football in the coming years.</p>
      <p>DaGrosa – whose interest in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">the Magpies</a>, sources suggest, remains very much alive and kicking – set out his vision for the future of football in the US and said that the influence of players and executives from the States will continue to grow.</p>
      <p>DaGrosa, speaking at the Miami version of Soccerex that his GACP group co-own, said: “I believe that Europe wins (in football) in the short term, but the US will win in the long term, because the money is here, the economic power of the United States when it gets behind a project is virtually unstoppable.”</p>
      <p>The bullish businessman was addressing the conference that brings together 2,000 attendees and is seen as the prime location for US football’s movers and shakers. Those are the sort of circles that DaGrosa and his group are hoping to raise the finance to complete a deal for Newcastle.</p>

      <p>In another room at the conference was a forum on why US investors are so keen to invest in football at the moment. <br/>DaGrosa did not speak publicly about Newcastle – largely because, according to people close to him who confirmed he would not speak on the Magpies before he left, the interest is ongoing and he doesn’t want to ruin ongoing talks with United – but he did speak about how US investors are keen to boost their influence on the sport across Europe and the globe.</p>
      <p>He spoke about “identifying and capitalising investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth” – presumably his biggest motivation for looking at Newcastle. And while the finance doesn’t appear to yet be in place to launch a bid for Newcastle, it’s believed the optimism that the group expressed originally has not dimmed.</p>
      <p>GACP and Kenyon have been in talks with Newcastle since 2018. United, for their part, insist it is business as usual as they plan for the future. (MD)</p>

      <p>Federico Fernandez has made a huge impact since his return to Newcastle United's starting line-up - but there have not yet been talks about extending the defender's contract.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old made his first league start of the season against Wolves last month, after Fabian Schar was ruled out with a sore knee, and has kept his place ever since.</p>
      <p>As well as being solid at the back, Fernandez has stepped up with a goal and two assists in his last three games and proved a real handful at set-pieces.</p>
      <p>Steve Bruce likes Fernandez, and was struck by his professionalism and hard work while he was out of the team, but the Argentine's contract expires next summer.</p>
      <p>ChronicleLive understands Fernandez's camp are adopting a 'let's see in January' stance to talks but the centre-back's family are settled in Newcastle, with his second child having been born on Tyneside, and he would like to stay at St James' Park. (CK)</p>

      <p>Newcastle United were among the 147 registered clubs who sent representatives to attend the 2019 Wyscout Forum in Amsterdam last week.</p>
      <p>The two-day event, held in the Johan Cruyff Arena, is billed as the world's number one event in football for transfer negotiations. In a speed dating style setting, Newcastle were able to set up 15-minute meetings in advance, with club-to-club networking and club-to-agent meetings dominating the agenda.</p>
      <p>Newcastle staff - analysts, coaches and scouts - use both Wyscout and partner Hudl on a day to day to day basis. The Wyscout tool has a new scouting area coming next year to help improve the links between agents, data and scouting. (CK)</p>
      <p>******</p>
      <p>Newcastle United will play their 14th consecutive Monday night away game when they kick off at Villa Park next week – more than any other club in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>The Magpies have not played a Monday night home game since 2012, when they hosted Wigan in the Europa League season. It is some record and feels unacceptable for a club where fans already have to do more travelling than others.</p>
      <p>Sky and BT Sport’s attitude is that with the amount of money they spend, they are entitled to move fixtures, while Newcastle themselves say their hands are tied. The Newcastle United Supporters Trust have registered their opposition to matches continually moving. (MD)</p>
      <p>******</p>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather is returning to Newcastle on his speaking tour in March – which might be a chance to get some clarity on the oddest takeover rumour of last year.</p>
      <p>The boxing great, who recently hinted that he was coming out of retirement, was quoted in the Daily Star as saying he’d be keen to buy Newcastle.</p>
      <p>He said: “I love Newcastle. Those guys like to party as hard as any city I have been to anywhere in the world. I met some of the players last year – and they are good guys. I am always open to new business opportunities and I love all sports, but I invest with my head not my heart.</p>
      <p>“Investing with your heart is the quickest way to lose money. But if somebody put together a business plan and my people looking over it and went ‘Floyd that can make money’ then I would invest. Soccer might not be my game but I’ve got connections everywhere.</p>
      <p>“Cristiano Ronaldo has been a long-time supporter and buddy of mine, so I might even be able to get him to finish his career off at Newcastle.”</p>
      <p>Needless to say, nothing happened after those quotes. (MD)</p>
