        <b>Marnus Labuschagne scored his maiden Test century as Australia strengthened their grip on the first Test against Pakistan on day three at The Gabba.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The hosts resumed on 312-1 but David Warner added three to his 151 before Steve Smith (4) was dismissed by Yasir Shah for the seventh time in six Tests.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne hit 20 boundaries in his 185 but was one of five wickets to fall for 35 runs as Australia totalled 580.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Starc then took two wickets as Pakistan reached 64-3, 276 runs adrift.</p>
      <p>Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir had picked up two of the final three Australia wickets, but his bowling analysis of 4-205 means he is the first bowler to concede more than 200 runs in a Test match on three occasions.</p>
      <p>The day belonged to Australia number three Labuschagne, although the South Africa-born batsman reached his first century, in his 16th Test innings, with one of his few false strokes - a thick outside-edge through third man to the boundary.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old batted for a touch over six hours and when he was eventually dismissed, caught in the gully by Babar Azam off Shaheen Afridi, he left to congratulations from the Pakistan players.</p>
      <p>Warner had previously become 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah's maiden Test wicket, edging to wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan after adding just three runs off 25 balls.</p>
      <p>That had brought Smith to the crease, but after hitting a boundary, he was bowled by Yasir. Only England's Stuart Broad has removed Smith more often in Tests than the leg-spinner, although his eight dismissals have come in 24 matches.</p>
      <p>Matthew Wade scored 60 in a 110-run fourth-wicket partnership with Labuschagne and Travis Head chipped in with 24 as the hosts posted a mammoth total.</p>
