      <h1>Searching for an ‘honest’ police general</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:48:24+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/alfred-p-dalizon" target="_blank">Alfred P. Dalizon</a></address>
      <h3>THE joke going around Camp Crame nowadays is about a police general who, when interviewed by the President looking for his next PNP chief looked straight into the eyes of his Commander-in-Chief and seriously told him that “Yes Mr. President, I am really competent but… I am not honest.’”</h3>
      <p>The joke started when President Duterte said he is looking for an honest official who will be the 3rd PNP chief under his administration and the 23rd in the PNP’s history after resigned Gen. Oscar Albayalde.</p>
      <p>Right now, there is still a continuing guessing game in Camp Crame about who will be the next PNP chief. Supposed to be, the new Chief would have been appointed by President Duterte after Albayalde quit his post last October 28.</p>
      <p>But instead, he designated Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa, the PNP Deputy Chief for Administration as PNP Officer-in-Charge. The former Davao City mayor also did not appoint a new PNP chief when Albayalde officially retired from the police force last November 8.</p>
      <p>This week, the President also did not announce who would be his new PNP Chief during a joint PNP-Armed Forces command conference in Malacañang Palace. For many present in the conference, It seems that Gen. Gamboa will be the PNP-OIC until the end of the year.</p>
      <p>It also means that President Duterte is still searching for an ‘honest’ police general to be his Chief,PNP at present and most likely is having a hard time in making a decision even with the different recommendation from many people surrounding him.</p>
      <p>I’ve made some research and found out that the adjective ‘honest’ is perfect for describing someone who tells the truth. “If you’re always honest, it means you’re truthful and sincere no matter what.’</p>
      <p>‘Honest’ came from the Latin word ‘honestus’ which means ‘honorable and respected’ and around 1300, ‘honest was popularly used to mean ‘respectable and of neat appearance. However at present, we don’t use it to describe the way someone dresses but instead how truthful they are, and sometimes to emphasize how simple and straightforward something is, like “good, honest home-cooked food” or even an ‘honest reporting.’</p>
      <p>Being honest means gaining or earning something without cheating or stealing. It means being fair, equitable, just. For many children, honesty means you ‘don’t tell a lie.’ That child’s thought has definitely become part of being honest. So if somebody would ask anybody of us if we are honest based on a child’s description,  I think that the big answer would be no. Definitely, many of us are not cheating or stealing, but it really would be next to impossible not to tell a lie.</p>
      <p>However, honesty means more than not lying. A more complete definition of honesty shows that an honest person doesn’t do things that are morally wrong. It is the quality of uprightness and fairness, of telling the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, the President is still looking for an honest police general whom he will appoint as PNP chief. It’s also the prerogative of the President to choose any of the 1-star generals up to 3-star generals as the law says.</p>
      <p>.Right now, the job is being handled by the members of the PNP Command Group and the top contenders for the post: Gamboa, Lt. Gen. Pikoy Cascolan and Major Gen. Gilor Eleazar.  </p>
      <p>However, as I have written many times before, new names have been added to the list including some classmates from PMA Class 1987 of Gen. Eleazar, a PNP Academy graduate named Brig. Gen. Gilbert Cruz and of course, the names of two young members of PMA Class 1991, Brig. Generals Vic Danao of the Calabarzon police and Filmore Escobal of the Southern Mindanao police force.</p>
      <p>BLESS OUR COPS MOVEMENT</p>
      <p>Speaking of real honesty, Gen. Gamboa this week led the 9th Bless Our Cops (BOC) Movement’s annual meeting in Tagaytay City with high hopes the organization will  further help produce a truly God-fearing and law-abiding police force where senior officers act as their ‘Brothers’ keepers’ and where cops literally read and follow the teachings of the Holy Bible.</p>
      <p>Members of the group which include Major Generals Lyndon Cubos, Cesar Binag and Bong Durana and  Brigadier Generals Dionards Carlos and Bernie Banac— all Peemayers— are embarking on an all-out effort to strengthen their relationship with the Lord Almighty and attracting more policemen to join them and help enrich their spiritual values particularly when it comes to decision-making and in responding to their day-to-day duties. It’s actually bringing God in every cop.</p>
      <p>The movement started in 1994 when then a group of junior officers including then Majors Cubos, Binag and Durana regularly held a small group fellowship with the belief that the only way to bring out change in the PNP is by introducing Christ into the life of each policeman. Congratulations to the group.</p>
      <p>On a personal note, I learned that around 50 PNP officers and 200 volunteer-pastors motored to the Tagaytay City-based Center for Community Transformation to attend the annual conference. I just wonder why there were only 50 PNP officers in the meeting, greatly outnumbered by the pastors.  Does it mean that the movement is having difficulty  attracting recruits?</p>
      <p>I have also been informed that during their stints as police station commanders, some of these officers turned down protection money being offered by operators of illegal vices including ‘jueteng’ in their areas.</p>
