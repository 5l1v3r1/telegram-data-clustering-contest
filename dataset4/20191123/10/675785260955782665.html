      <p>Cody was the last of seven children to be released from a Tuscan, Arizona, hospital last Saturday.</p>

      <p>The injured boy was travelling in a convoy of SUVs with seventeen members of the LeBaron Mormon community to visit family when they were attacked around 70 miles south of the US border.</p>
      <p>The families were travelling from their home on the La Mora ranch to a settlement along a hostile road controlled by men financed by Mexico’s illegal drugs trade, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-50339377">the BBC reported.</a></p>
      <p>Dawna Ray Langford and her sons Trevor, 11, and Rogan, two, were killed in one car while Christina Langford Johnson, 31, was killed in another. Her seven-month-old baby, Faith Langford, survived and was found on the floor of the vehicle. </p>
      <p>Mum Rhonita Maria LeBaron, 33, was killed along with her six-month-old twin babies, Titus and Tiana, and two other children - Crystal, eight, and Howard, 10. The others were allegedly taken hostage eight miles up the road.</p>

      <p>Mexican reports said the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity, as the family were travelling in SUVs similar to those used by cartel.</p>
      <p>Others say they could have been targeted in a crossfire.</p>
      <p>Cody’s extraordinary recovery has been documented online.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the youngster had his jaw wired shut and had to undergo further rounds of surgery after medics located yet another bullet.</p>
      <p>Video footage shows Cody in pyshio, his leg bandaged, practising to straighten his legs and learning to walk.</p>

      <p>So far the GoFundMe page has raised more than £190,000 which the father, David Langford, will use to cover medical expenses and split with the Miller and Johnson families, who were also caught up in the shooting.</p>
      <p>Mr Langford told ABC: "Every one of my children that survived that are living miracles," Langford said. "How many bullet holes were fired into that vehicle … at that horrific scene and how many children were involved. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's beyond amazing that they survived."</p>
      <p>Mr Langford said he wants the attackers to face justice. He added: "I believe in forgiveness, but I also believe in justice and forgiveness doesn't rob justice. You don't get justice too much in Mexico," he said.</p>
      <p>Most of the extended LeBaron family plan to leave Mexico after the shooting.</p>
