      <h3>NATIONAL Capital Region Police Office director, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas yesterday said they have officially activated a 24-hour Southeast Asian Games 2019 hotline where all information regarding peace and order condition and other concerns may be relayed as part of their major effort to ensure a ‘trouble-free SEA Games.’</h3>
      <p>The NCRPO SEA Games SMS and Viber hotline numbers are: 0915-983-4636 for Globe subscribers and 0998-325-5626 for Smart subscribers, the official said. According to Sinas, only SMS and viber messages can be sent to the hotlines and strictly no calls at all.</p>
      <p>The NCRPO official assured the public of prompt response to all queries, reports and complaints that will be sent to the 30th SEA Games hotlines. He explained that the hotlines will be monitored 24/7 by trained and competent policemen assigned with the NCRPO Operations Division at Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.</p>
      <p>According to Sinas, all information relayed to the hotlines will be referred to the concerned Task Group Commanders or units for immediate action.</p>
      <p>During the final coordinating meeting of Task Force NCR, Sinas said they have been ordered by Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa to ensure ‘zero-trouble’ during the major sporting event to be hosted by the Duterte government.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa and Sinas on Thursday led the send-off ceremonies for members of the NCR Task Group assigned to secure the 30th SEA Games starting this November 30.</p>
      <p>The Task Group NCR is composed of officers and men from the NCRPO and the Armed Forces of the Philippines as well as other member-agencies making a ‘whole-of government’ approach to turn the 30th SEA Games into a success with all athletes, coaching staff and other delegates secured until the games are over.</p>
      <p>During the send-off ceremonies held at the NCRPO headquarters in Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City, officers involved in the safety, security and emergency coverage at the Games which will be hosted by the Duterte government were told to be fully prepared for any contingencies.</p>
      <p>NCRPO Regional Chief of Staff and commander of the Task Group Reactionary Standby Support Force, Colonel Danilo P. Macerin presented the members of the task force and their resources.</p>
      <p>The 17,734-strong task force was received by the commander of the Security Task Force, Brig. Gen. Rey Lyndon T. Lawas, also the director of the PNP Training Service.</p>
      <p>Apart from the PNP and the AFP, other members of the task force come from the Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine Coast Guard, Office of Civil Defense and other government instrumentalities and local government units.</p>
      <p>The Functional Area Director for Games, Security and Safety Manila Cluster of the Philippine SEA Games Organizing Committee, retired AFP chief, Gen. Gregorio Pio C. Catapang Jr. called on the members of the task force to make the country proud.</p>
      <p>“Do Good: galingan niyo ang trabaho ninyo; Look Good: make sure you look good because you represent not only the PNP but the whole country; Talk good: we all have to talk good about the SEA Games, ito ay ating piyesta na idadaos natin kasama ang iba’t-ibang mga atleta,” Catapang said.</p>
      <p>For his part, Lt. Gen. Gamboa said he expects participating police officers to perform their tasks with the highest degree of professionalism, dedication, integrity and courage.</p>
      <p>“The 30th SEA Games event calls for the active participation and collaboration of every concerned entity not only to ensure its success but rather to deliver the best SEA Games 2019 edition, beating the high expectation of our counterparts,” the PNP-OIC said.</p>
      <p>Police are already enforcing a gun ban in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon regions and La Union province where all Permit-to-Carry-Firearms-Outside-of-Residence or PTCFORs issued to licensed gunholders have been suspended starting Wednesday until December 14 as part of the massive security preparations.</p>
