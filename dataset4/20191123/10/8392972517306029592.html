      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> are begging Jack Branning to bring down Leo Cameron.</p>
      <p>Viewers know Leo has been targeting Whitney Dean for several weeks and trying to gain her trust.</p>
      <p>Leo <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-reveals-biancas-mystery-man-is-tony-kings-son-leo/">is the son of paedophile Tony King</a>, the man who groomed Whitney from the ages of 12 to 16.</p>

      <p>However, Leo believes his father was innocent and is out for revenge on Whitney, who is now an adult. But will his plan be rumbled by Jack?</p>
      <p>In Thursday night's episode of EastEnders (November 22 2019), Jack was in court seeing to a case of a man who was up for perverting the court of justice, but it was apparent he should also be up for murder.</p>

      <p>As the accused came into the courthouse, Leo began grabbing at him calling him "murdering scum" and telling him he doesn't get to hide.</p>
      <p>Witnessing Leo's outburst, Jack had him arrested but Leo was able to talk his way out of it without being charged, as he's a paralegal.</p>
      <p>Later in The Vic while Leo and Whitney had a drink, Jack walked in and Whitney introduced Leo to her Uncle, but of course they already knew each other.</p>
      <p>Leo soon started looking Jack up online and later threatened him, pointing out that he didn't have the cleanest record.</p>
