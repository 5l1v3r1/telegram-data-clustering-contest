      <p>Earlier today, in a stunning political development, Maharashtra Governor B.S. Koshyari administered the oath of office to Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis as the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar as the new Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>The two were sworn-in at a function in the Raj Bhavan held around 8 a.m. in the presence of a few BJP and NCP leaders, and other government officials.</p>
      <p>Soon afterwards, Fadnavis said that the Governor would give them a letter instructing when to prove the new government's majority on the floor of the Assembly.</p>
      <p>He added that the cabinet would be expanded at a later date.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conveyed his best wishes to Fadnavis for taking over as the CM for a second consecutive term, and to Pawar on his appointment as Dy.CM.</p>
      <p>A letter was issued from Union Home Ministry simultaneously that said that President's Rule was lifted from Maharashtra.</p>
