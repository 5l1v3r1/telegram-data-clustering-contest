      <h1>Lauren London Praises Nipsey Hussle’s Greatness And Explains Why She Feels Humble With Tear-Jerking Message</h1>

      <p>Lauren London has never been one to hide the fact that she admired Nipsey Hussle and cherished the time they had together, and she has talked about their relationship quite often in the past.</p>
      <p>And now, months after the rapper’s death, London has continued to make it clear that she was deeply in love with her man, and she is still mourning her loss of him.</p>
      <p>This week, it was announced that the late Nipsey became Grammy-nominated artist.</p>
      <p>The rapper and activist earned three mentions posthumously, including Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for “Racks in the Middle” with Roddy Ricch and Hit-Boy and Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Higher” with “DJ Khaled and John Legend.</p>

      <p>London praised the musician and took the decision to open up about her relationship with Nipsey, and has shared various details about the way things between them were.</p>
      <p>And one thing is clear from it all — London was very appreciative of what Nipsey did for her, and for the community around him.</p>
      <p>She claimed that she was humbled to be around his greatness and proclaimed her eternal love for him.</p>
      <p>And of course, many fans of the rapper quickly poured on social media to express their own condolences for her loss, and to remind her that she still has a lot of support from the community, and should keep her head up.</p>

      <p>Not that she needs a reminder of that, though.</p>
      <p>One person said this: “My boy was fruitful with his craft before he departed 💙💙If he wins, please don’t let his mother accept it on his behalf. We can’t go through one of those speeches again. God bless her, but we just can’t. 🥴”</p>
      <p>This follower shared: “He had already been nominated for Victory Lap before he passed for the ones who are saying only because of his death. Well deserved”</p>
      <p>Another backer wrote: “Y’all should’ve given him his award when he got nominated last year when he was alive 🙄He wouldn’t have gotten this if he was alive 🚶🏾‍♀️ y’all only show love when they’re gone.”</p>

      <p>London is pretty obviously still standing strong, and she will continue to live her life to its fullest, even if she has to do it without the help of Nipsey by her side.</p>

      <p>She does seem to get along with the rapper’s fan community quite well, though, so hopefully, she will manage to pull through this difficult time and come out stronger in the end.</p>
      <p>The actress is a mother of two.</p>
