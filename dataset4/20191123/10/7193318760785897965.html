      <p>Renovations are set to move forward that would restore the appearance of the former Walter E. Allen Chrysler Plymouth dealership at NW 13 and Harvey Avenue in Midtown.</p>
      <p>The building has been home to Able Rents for the past 30 years while the west service garage half of the building was sold separately five years ago and renovated into offices.</p>
      <p>The Pivot Project purchased the building in August for $1.8 million, adding it to a growing list of historic properties the group has redeveloped, including the Tower Theatre, the Main Street Arcade and the Sunshine Laundry.</p>
      <p>Ben Sellers, who is a partner in the project with Jonathan Dodson and David Wanzer, said they are presenting plans for an exterior renovation at the December meeting of the Downtown Design Review Committee.</p>
      <p>Renderings show concrete panels will be removed from the former showroom, allowing for restoration of the two-story window facade. Windows closed years ago also will be reopened.</p>
      <p>Sellers said the plan is to do “core and shell” renovations with further work to await tenant leases.</p>
      <p>“We currently don't have a tenant in place for this, but are pursuing a couple of potential office tenants,” Sellers said. “We allowed Able to stay in the building for a brief time after acquisition, but they have finally moved out as of this week.”</p>
