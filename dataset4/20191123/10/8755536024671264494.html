      <p>Joe Duffy has backed calls to name an RTÉ building after the late Gay Byrne.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Councillor Mannix Flynn said the broadcaster should do something special to honour the former Late Late Show host, and shouldn’t wait “20 years” to do so.</p>
      <p>Agreeing with Mannix, Joe told the Irish Sun: “Yeah absolutely we’ve a building in RTE, a new building that’s called stage 7 I think.”</p>
      <p>“I think absolutely it should be renamed the Gay Byrne building. Definitely, absolutely, totally, completely, 100 hundred percent – I’ll paint the sign myself.”</p>

      <p>“I’ll decorate the new building. It’s not stage 7 we’ve rechristened it ‘The Gay Byrne memorial building’. I’ll paint the sign. Seriously,” he added.</p>
      <p>Gay Byrne passed away at his home on November 4 at the age of 85, following a long battle with cancer.</p>
      <p>Irish people were left devastated by his death, and <a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/people-from-all-over-the-country-flock-to-dublin-to-say-goodbye-to-gay-byrne-190251">mourners from all over the country travelled to Dublin to say goodbye to him</a> on the day of his funeral.</p>
