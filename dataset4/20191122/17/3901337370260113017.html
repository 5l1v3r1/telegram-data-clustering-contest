      <p>It can be said that Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune had a whirlwind of a week, that's if his activity and reactions on social media was anything to go by. We take a look at how crazy Khune's week has been online. Check it out!</p>
      <p>From Monday onwards, Khune's name was arguably on every fan's lips and was a trending topic online for a large chunk of the week. Even on Friday, the Bafana Bafana star was part of the South African trends list on Twitter after Chiefs declared "Itu" fit to play again.</p>

      <p>On 18 November, Khune's partner Sphelele Mak took to her Instagram account to reveal that the shot-stopper had paid lobola for her. Her post "broke the internet" as fans subsequently reacted to the news and congratulated the pair.</p>
      <p>A day later, Khune ignited more discussion on social media when he uploaded an image of his fiance to his Instagram account along with with a caption that read: "Hey #MrsK."</p>
      <p>The crowd favourite even posted an image of himself caressing the seemingly pregnant belly of his model partner, but he deleted the photo shortly thereafter.</p>
