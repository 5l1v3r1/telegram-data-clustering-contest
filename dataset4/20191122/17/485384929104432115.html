      <h1>From spills to scandals, the Betoota Advocate want us all to ask 'How Good's Australia?'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:13:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/bridget-judd/6651912" target="_blank">Bridget Judd</a></address>
      <p>Errol Parker adopts his signature deadpan drawl when asked about the publication's plans for the year ahead.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't mind having a Betoota corporate jet, and of course we'll be moving the organisation on paper over to Panama."</p>
      <p>From stinging political satires ("Abbott Family Decide It Might Be Time To Put Dad In A Home"), to cultural caricatures ("Unsupervised Boomer Finds Himself Watching SBS Food Again"), it's this tongue-in-cheek, take no prisoners approach that has propelled the Betoota Advocate into the national consciousness.</p>
      <p>Founded by Parker and his co-editor, Clancy Overell, "Australia's oldest newspaper" (actually a satirical news site) has grown exponentially since its entry into the media market — and so too has its personal brand.</p>
      <p>Purportedly forged in the fires of Betoota, a regional ghost town in Queensland's Channel Country ("We're one of the biggest employers in the Diamantina Shire," says Parker), the publication is no longer just two boys from the bush behind a keyboard: they have their own beer line and merchandising, and now their forthcoming book, How Good's Australia.</p>

      <p>So how do they stop themselves from becoming exactly what they're taking the piss out of?</p>
      <p>"As long as the person staring back at you in the mirror is a joke, it makes it easier," Parker quips, without skipping a beat.</p>
      <h3>'There's no-one we don't touch'</h3>
      <p>Tracking the nation's journey through chaos and confusion, How Good's Australia canvasses everything from <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-11/david-warner-insists-he-and-steve-smith-have-good-relationship/10485856">Sandpaper Gate</a> and the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-17/marriage-in-australia-how-love-and-law-have-changed-in-130-years/8430254">same-sex marriage plebiscite</a>, through to the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-23/barnaby-joyce-resigns/9477942">rise and fall of Barnaby Joyce</a> and last year's <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-23/heres-what-you-think-about-the-liberal-leadership-drama/10156964">Liberal leadership spill</a> (or the "night of the long knives," as Overell calls it).</p>
      <p>With titles like "Explorers Shocked To Discover Palmer United Leaflets At The Bottom Of The Mariana Trench", it would be easy to write the publication off as a bit of a laugh, immune to the responsibilities of the fourth estate.</p>

      <p>But beneath the headlines lie some pretty cut-through cultural criticisms — and by all accounts, the duo takes seriously their duty to hold those in power to account.</p>
      <blockquote>"There's no-one we don't touch, but we have noticed that certain factions or brands across all parties, some have jaws that are a bit more brittle," Overell says.</blockquote>
      <p>"With all of these issues in the world now, if there's people who take umbrage with what we do, I think they're looking in the wrong direction," adds Parker.</p>
      <h3>What's paid content and satire?</h3>
      <p>Amid the publication's growth, the duo has found themselves at somewhat of a crossroads.</p>
      <p>While they're renowned for turning the crosshairs on sponsored content ("Instagram Influencer Posts Instructional Video On How To Cut Fruit While Wearing A Sports Bra," reads one headline), in a bid to turn a buck, they're guilty of it too.</p>
      <p>For a cool $8,500, the site <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/09/25/betoota-advocate-sponsored-content/">sells news articles to advertisers</a>, in what they have dubbed their "bread-and-butter brand integration", Crikey first reported.</p>
      <p>It promises a "fun and humorous" experience, "authentic to our audience" — but at times, it's hard to tell the difference between what's paid content and what's satire ("A Couple Of Chips Identified As Gateway To Half Of Boyfriend's Meal" was actually an ad for KFC).</p>

      </p>
      <p>So do they feel like they're deceiving their audience?</p>
      <p>"Not really, we've been open about this in the past and no-one gets any favours done for them," says Overell.</p>
      <blockquote>"If we were to turn around the next day and put a particular brand on blast, the only people we'd be betraying is the people from the advertising agency, who we have very little respect for."</blockquote>
      <p>The duo doesn't shy away from the state of play: there are advertisers who believe the publication's audience will have an affinity with their brand, and they need to make a living.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But they're quick to stress that they steer away from taking money from "any industry that looks like it's going to end up in front of a royal commission — or has already done so".</p>
      <p>"So we've said no to a lot of banks and betting agencies," says Overell.</p>
      <h3>'I don't think it ever changes'</h3>
      <p>Despite the pressures of the 24-hour news cycle, the duo insists they're just like any other newsroom but they're cagey on their staffing numbers ("We have about 240 writers ... we do tend to be absolutely dumped in the payroll tax every year," Parker jokes).</p>
      <p>The vast majority of their content is workshopped on the day, and like any outlet, they face the challenge of staying timely and relevant to their audience.</p>
      <p>"Things have always been exciting and ridiculous, but you didn't have the 25-minute turnaround during children overboard," says Overell.</p>
      <blockquote>"We just wish we were around during the Rudd, Gillard, Rudd years — I don't think it ever changes."</blockquote>
      <p>Channelling their trademark sense of humour, the pair reflect on the current political climate — and the events that preceded it — with optimism.</p>
      <p>The culture wars are over, they say, and Australia is ready to herald a new era.</p>
      <p>"We now have a Prime Minister that we get to elect for a full term, or it looks like it'll be a full term at this rate," Overell jokes.</p>
      <p>"And of course we've got a federal cabinet with some of the most amazing minds in the country that are going to lead us to economic and environmental stability."</p>

      <p>If How Good's Australia is anything to go by, it seems unlikely the Betoota Advocate will find themselves short of political fodder in the years to come.</p>
      <p>So what's next for the nation's most fearless journalists?</p>
      <p>"With current trends, I'd say we'd be looking to do a 100 per cent sponsored content model — I've got my eye on an Aston Martin," quips Parker.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How Good's Australia is out November 26. The Betoota Advocate will be hosting a book launch in Brisbane on December 7, in Sydney on December 10 and 11 and in Melbourne on December 14.</b>
