      <p>Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde has warned Gerard Pique he must stay focused on football despite his other commitments this week.</p>
      <p>Pique is heavily involved with the Davis Cup tennis event that is currently ongoing in Madrid but is still expected to play at Leganes on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It is true that Gerard has issues outside of football,” the manager said at a pre-match press conference.</p>

      <p>“But curiously it is said that football players do not do things outside football and then when they do… ”</p>
      <p>“If he is focused he will play, if not I will play another. I see him as being focused.”</p>
      <p>Valverde was wary of underestimating bottom-of-the-table Leganes, especially now the club are led by a new manager in Javier Aguirre.</p>
      <p>“We are not to think that they are small enemies,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is true that Leganes are last but last year they beat us. We must focus on the three points and regain motivation.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what can change with the change of coach. I have the reference of the other teams that Aguirre has trained and I guess he will adapt to what he has.</p>
      <p>“He has a high level of motivation. He will try to wake them up, push them.”</p>
      <p>Aguirre says his squad “have a debt to people” as they prepare to host the league leaders.</p>
      <p>The Mexican manager was appointed on November 4 after a luckless run saw the team slip to the foot of the table with only one LaLiga victory to their name.</p>

      <p>Aguirre’s first fixture at the helm resulted in a 1-1 draw with fifth-placed Real Sociedad and another significant test awaits.</p>
      <p>“The team trained very well, we’ll see if we can capture it on the field because we are gaining confidence,” Aguirre said at a pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>“I told the players to separate the final result. Let’s play football, let the people who come to support us go home happy. We have a debt to people.</p>
      <p>“How many here would give a finger to play against them tomorrow, to play against (Lionel) Messi? I don’t know if a finger, but at least a nail. Millions of people will see it and if we win, people will know us.</p>

      <p>“It helps a lot that the team come out wanting to win the game, wanting to defend their colours and their shirt against their people.</p>
      <p>“Generally, Barcelona take your ball and you have to know how to play well without it.</p>
      <p>“The plan is not to make unnecessary fouls. Nor let them pass, but we must be intelligent. We will try to minimize Leo’s high probability of scoring goals.</p>
      <p>“I want people to go home saying ‘I liked my Leganes, I liked what I saw’.”</p>
