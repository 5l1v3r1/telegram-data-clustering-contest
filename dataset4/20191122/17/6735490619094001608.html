      <p>A car driving backwards in circles is peculiar enough. Now imagine thinking a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/dogs/">dog</a> is at the wheel.</p>
      <p>At around 8 a.m. on Thursday, Port St. Lucie, Fla., police received reports of a car circling for nearly an hour in a residential cul-de-sac.</p>
      <p>To make matters more interesting, a dog — and only a dog — was inside it.</p>

      <p>Police officers showed up in the area to investigate and discovered the car doing backwards doughnuts.</p>
      <p>In video footage shared with Global News, the silver vehicle can be seen moving in reverse as an officer slowly approaches it.</p>
      <p>According to Senior Sgt. Lisa Marie Carrasquillo of the Port St. Lucie Police Department, the owner realized he took a wrong turn and exited his car, leaving his dog behind in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>“The dog named Max accidentally hit the shift into reverse, causing the car to circle the cul-de-sac, leaving the owner locked out of the car,” Carrasquillo wrote in a media release shared with Global News.</p>

      <p>In attempt to get the car under control, police asked the owner for his extra car fob. The batteries, however, were dead, rendering the fob useless.</p>
      <p>In a second attempt, police successfully gained access by entering the code on the keypad located on the driver-side door.</p>
      <p>The circling car struck and damaged a mailbox, but otherwise, no injuries were reported. The car, meanwhile, sustained minor damage.</p>
      <p>Luckily, Max was left unharmed, too.</p>
