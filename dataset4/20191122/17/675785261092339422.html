      <p>Three men have been jailed for life after a homeless man was savagely beaten, wrapped in a sleeping bag and dumped in a UK road 'like a bag of rubbish' - before his attackers went off to buy booze.</p>
      <p>Homeless Latvian man Sandris Abimeicevs, 55, was brutally battered and left with brain damage, smashed ribs and a broken nose among a total of 50 visible injuries in a booze-fuelled attack.</p>
      <p>Russian national Olegas Borisovskis, 60, along with Lithuanian nationals Saulius Lemezonas, 44, and Vytautus Medeckis, 30, left his body before going to buy alcohol.</p>
      <p>They have no been jailed for life for murdering Mr Abimeicevs, wrapping him in the sleeping bag on November 6 last year.</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Farrer QC ordered Lemezonas and Medeckis to serve a minimum of 20 years and Borisovskis 18 years in jail before being considered for release.</p>
      <p>He told Birmingham Crown Court: "All of the defendants were drinking heavily. I have no doubt they were drunk during much if not all of this period. There was a disagreement which lead to violence.</p>

      <p>"The precise nature of the falling out is not clear but it appears to have stemmed from the belief that Mr Abimeicevs stole money from Borisovskis.</p>
      <p>"Mr Abimeicevs was subjected to a brutal and sustained beating. The violence extended over many hours.</p>
      <p>"I have no doubt he was struck numerous times with fists, feet and a weapon which may have been part of a broken chair."</p>
      <p>One of his attackers filmed Abimeicevs being taunted.</p>
      <p>The judge said there was a pause in the violence when on a video the defendants could be heard discussing the condition of the victim and describing as a "rat."</p>

      <p>He went on: "The three of you were involved in beating and humiliating an already seriously injured and therefore helpless man.</p>
      <p>"On any view the behaviour by the defendants demonstrated a complete indifference as to whether Mr Abimeicevs died or not."</p>
      <p>A horrified neighbour saw the trio dragging his body and alerted emergency services who were unable to save Mr Abimeicevs.</p>
      <p>Police arrested the men, who were covered in blood, at the scene and they were found guilty of murder following a three-week trial.</p>
      <p>The court heard Mr Abimeicevs was homeless and staying with the other two defendants, who were also homeless, in a bedsit which was let to Borisovskis.</p>
      <p>He had allowed Mr Abimeicevs to stay along with Lemezonas and Medeckis.</p>

      <p>All four men had been drinking over two to three days, but on the evening of the murder, a neighbour saw three men drag something down the stairs and dump it in the street.</p>
      <p>Two of the men were also captured on CCTV going to a local store to buy more alcohol.</p>
      <p>When they were interviewed by police they tried to blame each other but the jury found them all guilty of murder.</p>
      <p>Rachel Brand QC, prosecuting, said it was not known exactly what went on in the flat between the late afternoon of November 5 and early evening of November 6 and that the beating went on over a protracted period of time.</p>
      <p>"When it was clear he was dead or dying they put him in a sleeping bag and took him outside in the street where they dragged him along the pavement and left him like a bag of rubbish," she said.</p>
      <p>"There was no good reason to kill Mr Abimeicevs but they were all very drunk, all three of them and maybe that is an explanation."</p>
      <p>She said a neighbour, who had heard loud noises, had witnessed the "incredible scene" of the victim's body being dragged down the stairs and had called the police.</p>
      <p>The defendants blamed each other when quizzed by the police.</p>
      <p>Rossaro Scamardella QC, for Lemezonas, said he had been in the UK for 11 years after coming from Lithuania and had worked in labouring jobs.</p>
      <p>His criminal record was indicative of someone who's life had been "blighted by drink" and which had "culminated in this appalling incident".</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Michelle Allen, from West Midlands Police homicide unit, said: "This was a brutal attack on a man outnumbered by the other three, who didn't stand a chance to defend himself.</p>
      <p>"He would have known extreme pain before his death and I am pleased the jury recognised that all three are culpable for his murder.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts remain with Sandris' family, I hope that this verdict brings them a sense of justice and allows them to start to come to terms with his tragic and senseless death."</p>
