      <p>Ferland Mendy joined Los Blancos from Olympique Lyon for a reported fee of €53 million (R859 million) at the beginning of the season, but things could have been very different for the France international defender.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old recently revealed how a hip injury during his youth nearly put an end to his career as a footballer before it had even begun.</p>
      <p>"(The injury came) when I was 14, almost 15 years old, on the left hip," Mendy said, as reported by <i>Marca.</i></p>

      <p>"Being told at that age that football is over for you and you won't play anymore, I thought that I would never fulfil my dream.</p>
      <p>"I spent two months in the hospital with both legs in plaster and that's when I understood that I had to learn to walk again.</p>
      <p>"I started and I was like four or five months in rehab.</p>
      <p>"I learned to walk a month later, although I forced myself too much, because it kept hurting for a year or two."</p>
