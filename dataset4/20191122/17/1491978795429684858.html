      <p>Incident commander and assistant chief fire officer Mark Andrews said: “The fire spread from the basement through to the upper floors. There is considerable smoke in the area and we are advising people to keep doors and windows closed. We will now work to ensure that the fire is completely put out.</p>
      <p>“This will take several hours and so the roads in the area are likely to remain closed for the foreseeable future.”</p>
      <p>Andrews added: “The swift actions of the hotel staff meant everyone got out of the hotel safely, and we thank them for their efforts.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Eastbourne borough council said: “Forty people have been looked after today at our rest centre that was set up in Eastbourne town hall after the fire at the Claremont hotel.</p>
      <p>“Most of those were residents of Elms Avenue, who were evacuated from their homes as a safety precaution and will be able to return home this evening.”</p>
      <p>It added: “We also provided shelter for two cats, who were temporarily housed in the mayor’s parlour, and one dog.</p>
      <p>“Another couple had lost their phones in the fire and a member of our team was able to contact their daughter on social media to let her know that they were safe.</p>
      <p>“Hotel accommodation was arranged for one couple with medical needs who were unable to return to their flat because of smoke damage.</p>
      <p>“Blankets, wash kits, refreshments, hot food and pet food were provided. Beds were also brought in case anyone needed to stay overnight.</p>
      <p>“Twenty members of our team have been involved in this operation today and worked hard to help those affected by the fire. We would like to thank them for their efforts.”</p>
      <p>It said the seafront road near the Claremont hotel would remain closed while structural engineers investigate the site.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire will be investigated.</p>
