      <p>(CNN) - It's rare to find an almost-perfect copy of Marvel Comics' first comic book, aptly named "Marvel Comics 1." But one in near-mint condition just sold for a record $1.26 million.</p>
      <p>It's the "finest known copy" of the comic book, according to Heritage Auctions, which handled the bidding. It's also the most anyone has ever paid for a comic from Marvel Comics, it said.</p>
      <p>The comic book was first released on October 1, 1939, and it introduced fans to characters including the Human Torch, Angel, Sub-Mariner and the Masked Raider.</p>
      <p>The auctioned comic was bought off a newsstand rack soon after its release by a mailman in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Heritage Auctions said in a news release.</p>
      <p>"This is a historic copy of a historic comic book," Ed Jaster, the auction house's senior vice president, said in the statement.</p>
      <p>But it's still not the most expensive comic book ever sold. "Action Comics #1," the first Superman comic, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html">sold for more than $3.2 million in 2014 on eBay</a>.</p>
