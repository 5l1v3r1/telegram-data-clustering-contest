      <h1>Virginia Man Adopts Highways in President Trump's Honor</h1>
      <h2>A young man in Fairfax County, Virginia, is showing his support for Trump by adopting highways in the president’s honor.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:21:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Furr</a></address>
      <p>Nick Umbs, who is a <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/adopt-a-highway-sign-shows-love-for-president-trump-in-fairfax-county">member</a> of a small group called the President Trump Fan Club, cares for sections of highway on Ox Road and Burke Lake Road, Fox 5 reported.</p>
      <p>Even though the fan club has only a few members, Umbs said he wanted to do something positive for President Trump.</p>
      <p>He commented:</p>
      <blockquote>I thought it would be kind of a neat idea to do something kind of in support because all of this publicity that we see is always negative, negative, negative. And I wanted to show that there are people out there who are supportive of the president who are doing good and good for the community.</blockquote>
      <p>Twice this year, Umbs and his girlfriend, who is also a member of the fan club, have picked up trash along the highways where the signs stand, bearing the president’s name.</p>
      <p>Umbs <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/11/19/the-president-trump-fan-club-is-cleaning-up-roads-in-a-deep-blue-part-of-virginia/">told</a> the <i>Washingtonian</i> that he enjoyed tidying up the two-and-a-half-mile stretch of roads, even though “it’s a pretty liberal area.”</p>
      <p>“No matter what side of the aisle people are on they thank us, they roll down the window and give us a thumbs up, honk their horn,” he said.</p>
      <p>When asked what he will do if Trump does not win a second term, Umbs stated, “That is a really good question! I guess I would just keep cleaning it up. I think the permits are good for three years. I don’t think my support’s going to change.”</p>
      <p>In 2016, Fairfax County gave President Trump just a little more than 28 percent of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-man-supports-trump-by-adopting-highways-in-his-honor">vote</a>, whereas Hillary Clinton got 64 percent, according to Fox News.</p>
      <p>However, that fact has not caused the young man to question his support for the president.</p>
      <p>“I really like President Trump,” Umbs said. “I really feel like he follows through with what he says, and number one that he absolutely loves the country … and if I have to clean up trash to show my support, I’m willing to do that.”</p>
