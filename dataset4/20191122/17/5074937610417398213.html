      <p>Accra, Nov 22, GNA - Maariba, an artisan job matching platform, has sign a partnership agreement with the Artisans Association of Ghana (AAG) to ensure that more artisans are connected to jobs easily.</p>
      <p>The alliance between the two bodies in Accra promises to respond to artisans growing difficulty of identifying job opportunities to support themselves and families.</p>
      <p>Mr David Achaw, Executive Director, Maariba speaking at the launch of the alliance said many artisans found it difficult to access jobs and the synergy would bring more artisans on board the platform and give them access to jobs around the clock.</p>
      <p>He said within a year of Maariba’s operation, it recorded about 7,000 users on its platform within the country and across sub-Sahara Africa and was hopeful that with the partnership the platform would now be accessible to about 20,000 artisans.</p>
      <p>Mr Achaw said it was the target of the partners to increase the users on the platform to 50,000 in the next 4 months and to 400,000 by the close of 2020.</p>
      <p>He said they were committed to their core mandate to provide artisans with customers, link them to offices, homes and to provide services at the most competitive and affordable rates.</p>
      <p>He said artisans were skilled and trained professionals and needed the necessary training for capacity building to make them marketable.</p>
      <p>Mr Eric Mac-Dorgbey, Finance and Administrative Manager, AAG said it was the mandate of AAG to promote the general interest of artisans and the partnership would make it easier for member’s access jobs from the comfort of their workshops.</p>
      <p>He said mostly both artisans and customers went through a lot to access  services from each other, but with Maariba that would be of the past.</p>
      <p>He said for the past seven years, the Association put together capacity building workshops to enhance the craftsmanship of its members adding that initially membership was opened to only artisans within the construction field, but now other professionals such as hairdresser, tailors, interior decorators also joined.</p>
