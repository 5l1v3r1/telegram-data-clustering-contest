      <h1>Mazda CX-3 121PS 2WD GT Sport Nav+ review – Crossover is the real deal</h1>
      <h2>The Mazda CX-3 is great value as it ticks all the boxes for those seeking a smaller family crossover. Here, we give you the lowdown on spec, performance and price of the top-end 121PS 2WD GT Sport Nav+ version.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:30:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Giles Blair, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/giles-blair/</a></address>
      <p>IF YOU’RE in the market for a small family crossover/SUV, Mazda’s CX-3 should be high on your list of contenders.</p>
      <p>It is very competitively priced given its quality, stylish design and choice of cracking powertrains. I’ve recently tested the special edition GT Sport Nav+ and couldn’t believe that it cost just £24,095, given the amount of on-board goodies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mazda">The Japanese car maker's</a> CX-3 immediately catches the eye thanks to its bold, muscular front-end and rear that are connected by flowing lines along the profile. You’re also sure to notice the 18in 10-spoke bright alloys that this version sports.</p>
      <p>I loved the matt silver front and rear skid plates, high-end signature LED daytime running lights, bright silver door mirrors and good use of chrome and silver accents – including the dual tailpipes.</p>

      <p>The premium feel continues inside with a perforated Nappa leather seat trim complemented by white faux leather inserts for the door trim and across the dash.</p>
      <p>The splashes of chrome and carbon-fibre effect finishing were also pleasing and, as well as the soft-touch materials, there was good use of durable plastics on areas of the car that might be more prone to receiving a bashing.</p>
      <p>There is good room for a family of four to travel in comfort, along with various cubby holes to take all the possessions and four cup holders.</p>
      <p>The boot is sensibly shaped for easy loading but the trade-off for the Bose sound system in the GT Sport Nav+ is that its size drops from 350 to 287 litres. It still took my golf trolley with ease, though.</p>

      <p>What is likely to impress drivers and passengers most about this top-spec CX-3 is the level and nature of the creature comforts.</p>
      <p>A colour head-up display featuring traffic sign recognition, vehicle speed including warnings, navigation directions and cruise control info is a rarity in vehicles in this price bracket but most welcome.</p>
      <p>Comfort for the driver is assured thanks to powered seat adjustment – including a memory function – while both front seats and the leather steering wheel are heated.</p>

      <p>This model also comes with one of my favourite driver aids – an auto hold/disengage function as part of the electronic parking brake. It makes driving in busy traffic situations so much easier.</p>
      <p>Everyone will enjoy the very effective climate control, while the motorist is sure to appreciate the cruise control, silky smooth stop/start set-up and keyless entry and start.</p>
      <p>The infotainment system uses a seven-inch colour touchscreen atop the dash, which can also be controlled by Multimedia Commander dials and buttons between the driver and front passenger.</p>
      <p>The set-up allows for hands-free phone calls and music selection from the DAB or internet radio, CD player or connected device. It also provides access to various car functions, sat nav, and even Facebook and Twitter.</p>

      <p>There are a raft of electronic braking and stability systems, including smart city brake support that will automatically apply the brakes to help avoid a crash at up to 50mph. Other useful features are a lane departure warning system and a reversing camera.</p>
      <p>The GT Sport Nav+ is powered by a 121PS 2.0-litre petrol engine mated to a six-speed manual gearbox driving the front wheels. This powertrain is refined and ideal for everyday family driving, as are the nicely weighted steering and fairly soft suspension.</p>
      <p>A 0-62mph time of 9.0 seconds, top speed of 119mph, average fuel economy of 42.8mpg and CO2 emissions of 141g/km are also likely to meet with approval.</p>
