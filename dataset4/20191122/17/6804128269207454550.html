      <h1>Kieran Tierney responds to Aubameyang and Lacazette after they noticed what he did in training</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal full-back was trolled on social media by his teammates</h2>

      <p>Kieran Tierney is beginning to gain a rather unique reputation at <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>'s training ground.</p>
      <p>Despite the freezing temperatures, the Scottish defender has regularly been pictured at London Colney in recent weeks wearing nothing but a short-sleeved training kit, and shorts.</p>
      <p>This is in comparison to his teammates, who have been seen wrapped up in long-sleeved sweatshirts, gloves and snoods.</p>
      <p>Strikers Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang were pictured in disbelief with Aubameyang posting a snap of their exaggerated reaction to Tierney on Instagram.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal captain wrote: '@kierantierney : with short sleeves and Shorts. Us: Daaaammmmnnnnn @Lacazettealex'. Tierney responded by sharing the picture, and posting laughing face emojis.</p>

      <p>The former Celtic defender is set to be involved on Saturday as Arsenal take on Southampton at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>The Scottish international joined Arsenal from Celtic for £25million in the summer, and the full-back says he is adjusting well to living in England following his move across the border, revealing that several of his fellow Arsenal defenders have helped him settle into life in London.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqKAv5vgk8M&amp;feature=youtu.be">Pro Direct Soccer</a> , Tierney revealed that he has formed bonds with the likes of Hector Bellerin, Dino Mavropanos, Callum Chambers and Rob Holding since arriving at the Emirates, and that Celtic fans on Arsenal's staff have also helped.</p>
      <p>"Because I’ve been injured and Bellerin was injured and Big Dino as well, I’ve been close with them," he said.</p>
      <p>“Hector is a big voice in the changing room as well so he’s helped me settle in. Rob Holding and Calum Chambers as well have looked after me.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to say though because everyone has been great, even the staff.</p>
      <p>"There’s a few Scottish staff as well – Celtic fans – so they’ve helped me settle in and make me feel at home.”</p>
