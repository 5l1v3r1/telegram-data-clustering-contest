      <h1>VirnetX patent win against Apple vacated by U.S. appeals court</h1>

      <p>(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday voided a jury’s calculation that Apple Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O">AAPL.O</a>) should pay $503 million for infringing patents owned by licensing firm VirnetX Holdings Corp , setting the stage for another potential trial in a decade-old legal battle.</p>
      <p>In a partial victory for VirnetX, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left in place a Texas jury’s finding that Apple iPhones infringed two VirnetX patents relating to secure communications technology.</p>
      <p>The court reversed the jury’s infringement finding on two other patents, however. Based on that ruling, the court sent the case back to a Texas judge for further proceedings.</p>
      <p>The Texas judge must consider whether to hold a new damages-only trial or to recalculate damages without holding one, the appeals court said.</p>
      <p>VirnetX’s stock price dropped more than 50 percent on the news before recovering slightly in later trading.</p>
      <p>Representatives of VirnetX and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Zephyr Cove, Nevada-based VirnetX, which was founded by employees at government contractor Science Applications International Corp, holds patents related to secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links.</p>
      <p>VirnetX and Apple have been fighting over patents since 2010 in rollercoaster litigation that has triggered wild swings in the technology licensing company’s stock price.</p>
      <p>The case at issue in Friday’s ruling, which went to trial in April 2018, is one of a handful of lawsuits VirnetX has brought against Apple alleging unauthorized use of patented technology.</p>
