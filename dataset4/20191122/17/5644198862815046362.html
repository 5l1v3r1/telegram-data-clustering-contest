      <p>The fundraising comes as private equity firms globally shift from focusing purely on buyouts towards becoming all-round investment houses with a series of alternative assets, such as infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit.</p>
      <p>KKR has about a dozen people in the region focused on infrastructure, according to the person. It made its first investment in the sector with a US$400 million deal taking control of India Grid Trust (IndiGrid).</p>
      <p>Separately, the firm has begun raising its fourth Asian private equity fund, aiming to raise US$15 billion, Reuters reported this month.</p>
      <p>The firm has also been raising a real estate fund for Asia,targeting US$1.5 billion, Reuters reported in March.</p>
