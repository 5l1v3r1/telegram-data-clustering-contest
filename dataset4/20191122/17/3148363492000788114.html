      <p>With a caption reading, “His reign will soon be over. Woe to the loyal subjects of this counterfeit king,” the <i>Dumb &amp; Dumber</i> star’s cartoon features the president dressed in an Elvis Presley jumpsuit and singing the lyrics to The King’s hit song, “Suspicious Mind.”</p>
      <p>In the drawing, Elvis-Trump is singing, “They’re caught in a trap. They can’t walk out. Because they love me too much, baby.”</p>
      <p>The president’s microphone cord is also wrapped around a pack of Republicans and cabinet members who are tied up by their support for the president.</p>

      <p>The <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>star repeatedly uses his politically charged drawings and his Twitter account as an outlet to release his frustrations with the president, his family, and Republican lawmakers. Only weeks ago, Carrey <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/02/jim-carrey-promotes-impeachment-drawing-of-pelosi-crushing-trumps-testicles/">posted</a> a drawing he entitled “Welcome to Nancy’s Wheelhouse,” depicting the Democrat Speaker of the House smashing President Trump’s testicles with her speaker’s gavel.</p>
      <p>“This is a cartoon I call ‘Welcome to Nancy’s Wheelhouse.’ It’s intended for mature audiences,” Jim Carrey said promoting the graphic piece.</p>

      <p>Last month Jim Carrey even took out after presidential adviser Rudy Giuliani with a cartoon <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/17/new-york-magazine-publishes-jim-carrey-drawing-monster-rudy-guiliani/">calling</a> the former New York City mayor a “monster.”</p>
