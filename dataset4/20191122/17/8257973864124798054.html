      <p>The contractor has received several contract modifications for the ship's engineered overhaul this year, including modifications for $67 million and <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/09/25/HII-awarded-58M-for-work-on-Columbus-Helena-submarines/8011569413932/">$20 million</a>, both in September, and <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/04/05/HII-awarded-189M-for-upgrades-on-USS-Columbus-ship/7681554467221/">an $18.9 million modification</a> in April.</p>
      <p>Funds have been obligated at the time of the award and will expire at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Work under the latest deal will be performed in the company's shipyards in Newport News, Virginia and is expected to be complete by November 2020.</p>
