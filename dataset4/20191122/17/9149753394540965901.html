      <h1>WWE 2K20 patch 1.03 has been corrupting some players' save data</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:23:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p>WWE 2K20 is a bit of a mess. In October, it launched in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/wwe-2k20-is-ridiculous/">laughably bad state</a>, and now the latest patch, ostensibly meant to tackle crashes and bugs with wrestlers' hair and clothes, has been corrupting some players' save data. </p>
      <p>YouTuber SmackTalk and others posted screenshots of the warning message, post-update, informing them that their save data had been corrupted and a new save would have to be made. Other players also chimed in below the tweet with similar issues. </p>

      <p>Neither the WWE 2K20 or 2K support accounts addressed the problem, though the game appears to have been rolled back to 1.02, before the save corruption. If you didn't make a new save, you should hopefully be able to access your old one. </p>
      <p>I asked 2K about the issue with the update and what the status of the patch is, but it's yet to respond. </p>
