        <b>Brad Potts has been the man who Preston boss Alex Neil has turned to the most to come off the bench this season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Championship games, the midfielder has joined the action as a substitute seven times.</p>
      <p>Only three times has last January’s buy from Barnsley started in the league this campaign.</p>
      <p>That is in contrast to the second-half of last season when Potts started 10 games in a row and never finished on the losing side. Knee surgery was to bring his season to an premature end in March.</p>
      <p>When his knee needed more rest during pre-season, that appeared to have a knock-on effect in terms of the first three months of this campaign.</p>
      <p>Potts had not quite found his rhythm, hence others getting in ahead of him in the midfield.</p>
      <p>Last season, Potts and Alan Browne were used an attacking midfielders in a 4-1-4-1 system.</p>
      <p>With Neil favouring more of a 4-2-3-1, there has only been one No.10 role up for grabs, with Daniel Johnson and Browne filling that between them.</p>
      <p>It is Browne who has the joint second highest number of substitute appearances in the league, coming off the bench six times – he shares that statistic with Jayden Stockley.</p>
      <p>The last time Browne was a sub was at Reading a month ago, with him having started the last four Preston games.</p>
      <p>Like Browne, Stockley has also forced his way back into the side of late, starting the last two matches after that game-changing appearance from the bench against Blackburn.</p>
      <p>Paul Gallagher and Andre Green have come off the bench four times and David Nugent three times.</p>
