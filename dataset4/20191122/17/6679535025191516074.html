      <p>Andhra wicketkeeper-batsman Srikar Bharat has been asked to join the Indian team in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Talking to <i>The Hindu</i>, the 26-year-old Bharat said, “It’s a big moment. It means my performances are being recognised.”</p>
      <p>Apparently, the Indian team-management wants to have a closer look at Bharat who has earned praise for his ’keeping skills, ahead of the tour of New Zealand.</p>
      <h3>Learned from Saha</h3>
      <p>Bharat said he learned much from Wriddhiman Saha during the India ‘A’ tour of the West Indies this year. “Saha treated me like a younger brother, we spoke about different aspects of ’keeping.”</p>
      <p>While the basics in ’keeping were important, Bharat added, “What matters at the highest level is how you cope with and react to pressure.”</p>
      <p>Somebody who averages 37.58 with the bat in First Class cricket, Bharat revealed he learnt much from the legendary Rahul Dravid.</p>
      <h3>Dravid’s advice</h3>
      <p>Bharat said, “Dravid sir would speak about reading the game situation, batting through sessions.”</p>
      <p>And Bharat honed his skills, particularly standing up, playing in the first division league in Chennai, at Young Stars, for five years before moving to MRC-A.</p>
      <p>Bharat, whose idol is M.S. Dhoni, believed the competition for ’keeping slots in the Indian team was healthy.</p>
