      <p>The Caldwell County, Missouri, Sheriff’s Office confirmed Friday <u><a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/human-remains-found-in-nebraska-could-belong-to-brothers-killed-in-braymer">the human remains found in a livestock trailer</a> </u>in Nebraska belong to one of two brothers from Wisconsin who went missing while on a business trip in northwest Missouri.</p>
      <p>The remains were discovered Nov. 15 by a rancher in Hershey, Nebraska, inside a large, plastic tub full of dirt that had been in a stock trailer he purchased in Missouri.</p>
      <p>The Caldwell County Sheriff’s Office said the remains had been identified as Justin Diemel’s.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Diemel’s were found on a farm in rural Caldwell County which belonged to 25-year-old Garland Nelson.</p>
      <p>Both identities were confirmed using dental records, the sheriff’s office said.</p>
      <p>The brothers <u><a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/brothers-from-wisconsin-go-missing-in-missouri-clinton-county-sheriff-investigating">went missing in July</a> </u>after coming to Braymer, Missouri, to conduct business with Nelson on his cattle farm.</p>
      <p>Nelson <u><a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/braymer-man-charged-with-murder-in-wisconsin-brothers-deaths">faces a slew of charges in the deaths,</a> </u>including two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of abandonment of a corpse, two counts of tampering with physical evidence, two counts of armed criminal action, tampering with a motor vehicle and unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
      <p>Nelson remains jailed without bond.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office said the investigation into the brothers’ deaths is ongoing with assistance from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.</p>
