      <p>Another week in the bag, and I can’t tell if it was an eventful one or not. It certainly sped by rather quickly but did I get much gaming done? Not really.</p>
      <p>I finished off the original Luigi’s Mansion on 3DS last weekend, meaning that I could return to Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch and pick up where I left off. There’s been a huge shift in gameplay depth, in addition to just how much prettier it is. Beyond that, a lashing of Destiny 2 and some Age of Wonders: Planetfall – Revelations made up the rest of my gaming week. I’ve also been trying to remember what I’ve done with my gloves, now that it’s nippy as anything out and about…</p>
      <p><b>Dom</b> has been playing with Google Stadia, dipping into Destiny 2 and Samurai Shodown on the new streaming service, and saying “it really works!” Aside from that, he’s been reviewing Terminator Resistance, Planet Zoo, Skybolt Zack, Super Monkey Ball Blitz and playing some Castlestorm with his son, who’s been hunting down the strategy games on his PC.</p>
      <p><b>Aran</b> popped up to tell us about squeezing Red Dead Redemption 2 and Narcos: Rise of the Cartels in and around drafting essays. It’s the latter of these that has really taken precedence. Three essays to do, 12,000 words to churn out and a deadline on Monday! Good luck, Aran!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Gamoc</b> has been immersing himself in a whole other world to essay writing. Specifically those of VR Ping Pong Pro, Last Labyrinth and Golem, all on PlayStation VR. When returning to the real world, he’s hopped into Killing Floor 2, “which is a rare game I actually enjoy playing online. It’s awesome.”</p>
      <p>It’s a familiar jaunt into Destiny 2 for <b>Tom</b>, who’s nabbed a couple of the game’s pinnacle weapons and made another run through the Garden of Salvation raid. He’s also spent a lot of time with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which he thinks might just be his game of the year!</p>
      <p>Putting off all things non-video game related, <b>Miguel</b> finished Control, “which was absolutely amazing”, and has split the rest of his time since with Death Stranding, Pokémon Sword, and just for the hell of it, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Also enjoying Pokémon was <b>Nic B</b>, who complimented it with Minecraft Earth, and Deemo Reborn, which is excellent in his estimation.</p>
      <p><b>Steve’s</b> had a solid week of gaming. Welcome to Hanwell was buggy but interesting, he’s spent a few hours in the demolition derbies of Flatout Ultimate Carnage, and finished Sparklite for an upcoming review. He’s on the other side of coursework, with undergrad marking to do…</p>
      <p>It’s been more Beat Saber for <b>Jim</b>, who’s been enjoying the new Rocket League music Pack, and he’s also immersed himseld in Shenmue III, which is exactly what he expected – “There’s a certain tone and pace there that hasn’t changed even after 18 years” – and he booted up Prince of Persia on PS3 for a throwback to simpler times.</p>
      <p>And finally, <b>Tuffcub</b> is back to wearing jeans in the cold misery of the UK. He played Assassin’s Creed Liberation on PS Vita on his trip back, and started Control at 2AM this morning because of jet lag. He’s not that impressed. “So far I can’t see what the hype was about,” he says.</p>
