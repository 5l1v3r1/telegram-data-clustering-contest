      <p>A 17-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> McDonald’s employee was hit with a brick and beaten unconscious earlier this week after she refused to give free food to a group of teen boys, her cousin said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">attack</a> on Charm Sullivan began while she was working behind the counter Wednesday night, her cousin, Khadijah Lovett, told NBC 10. She said at least four boys approached her and asked for free food, but when Sullivan denied their request, they began attacking her and followed her when she tried to flee into the restaurant’s bathroom.</p>
      <p>“The only thing she keeps saying is she doesn’t know why her. Why her?” Lovett told the station.</p>
