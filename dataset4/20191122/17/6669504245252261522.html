      <p>VICTORIA - BC Hydro says its customers are largely unprepared for power outages despite increasingly severe winter storms.</p>
      <p>The Crown utility says in a report that it's seeing increasing damage to its infrastructure because of storms in recent years.</p>
      <p>A powerful windstorm last December left 750,000 customers without power and tens of thousands waited more than three days before it was reconnected in the largest outage in the utility's history.</p>
      <p>BC Hydro says a survey of 800 customers found more than 60 per cent have not taken steps to prepare for storm-related power outages and only half have an emergency kit.</p>
      <p>The survey found that most people affected by the December 2018 storm felt they could have been more prepared, yet only half have taken any steps toward that since then.</p>
      <p>BC Hydro is encouraging customers to stock emergency kits with enough supplies to sustain each member of a household for at least three days.</p>
      <p>A kit should include a flashlight with extra batteries, a first-aid kit, any required medication, non-perishable food and bottled water.</p>
      <p>The utility is also reminding people to call 911 if they come across a downed or damaged power line, which should be considered live and dangerous.</p>
      <p>In December 2017, an ice storm that hit the Fraser Valley caused challenges for crews when freezing rain and below-zero temperatures caused ice to form on trees, which broke and fell onto power lines or knocked down power poles.</p>
      <p>BC Hydro says its equipment became encased in ice and the poor weather conditions made it extremely difficult for crews to respond.</p>
      <p>In August 2015, a summer windstorm knocked out power to more than 700,000 customers over a three-day period on the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.</p>
