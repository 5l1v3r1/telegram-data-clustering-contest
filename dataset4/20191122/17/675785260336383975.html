      <h1>How Man City's record-breakers handed Pep Guardiola his worst ever start to a season</h1>
      <h2>ANALYSIS: Manchester City enter the weekend nine points behind league leaders Liverpool, and are stumbling in the wake of the Reds' relentlessness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Keble</a></address>
      <p>Even setting aside Liverpool’s commanding nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League table <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>’s 2019/20 season has been disastrous by Pep Guardiola’s high standards.</p>
      <p>Having failed to win a third of their 12 games and currently on track for 79 points, this is statistically Guardiola's worst ever start to a campaign.</p>
      <p>Man City are still among the best in the world; are still playing scintillating football and, with a bit more luck, would be closer to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> at the top.</p>
      <p>The xG statistics certainly suggest they should have won more points at this stage, and indeed any critique of City’s shortcomings this year must acknowledge Guardiola’s side are a victim of their own success.</p>
      <p>We have come to expect perfection.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Nevertheless City are notably weaker than last season due to subtle tactics changes made by Guardiola and emerging problems in several key areas of the pitch.</p>
      <p>The most obvious flaw is in central defence, where without the injured Aymeric Laporte and the departed Vincent Kompany City lack leadership, positional discipline, and confidence.</p>
      <p>Guardiola’s deployment of an extremely high defensive line and a constant high press requires self-belief as much as tactical coaching, leaving no room for hesitant or error-prone defenders.</p>
      <p>The individual mistakes and collective lack of chemistry has too often created a zigzag back line, allowing the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> and Norwich to counter-attack directly through the centre of the pitch, breaking into huge open patches of grass in front of Ederson’s goal.</p>

      <p>But equally important is the knock-on effect of their nervous defending.</p>
      <p>City aren’t pressing as aggressively, or passing the ball with the same urgency as 2018-19, because a subconscious distrust in what’s behind them (namely Nicolas Otamendi and Fernandinho) makes them shrink slightly.</p>
      <p>Guardiola’s high-risk football demands bravery, demands confidence in your team-mates. The psychological shift is almost imperceptibly small, but in such a complexly woven tactical setup the slightest movement can knock everything out of position.</p>
      <p>And speaking of wrong positions, Fernandinho’s removal from defensive midfield to deputise for Laporte has also weakened City. Rodri is yet to settle into the speed of English football and Ilkay Gundogan doesn’t spot danger as quickly as Fernandinho, meaning City lack that vital screening presence.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When they lose the ball in the opposition third, Guardiola’s team are now vulnerable to a counter-attack where previously their Brazilian midfielder would shut it down at source. And if you can evade the first wave of the City press, then countering at Otamendi can be very fruitful.</p>
      <p>Chopping and changing their left-back has also contributed to a worsening defensive record.</p>
      <p>Angelino couldn’t cope with Mohamed Salah at Anfield a fortnight ago, although Guardiola’s overall tactical plan was more to blame for that defeat.</p>
      <p>His 4-4-2 formation was too narrow, giving Liverpool’s full-backs the freedom to dominate the game, allowing the hosts to easily cut through an under-stocked central midfield.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that for all City’s tactical problems this season, a better system at Anfield might have reversed the result, cutting the gap to three points and ending concerns regarding tactical problems at City. These are fine margins indeed.</p>
      <p>But defeat at Anfield was widely expected largely because City don’t quite look themselves – and not just in defence.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Kevin de Bruyne has shifted out from the number eight position to the right wing this season, repeatedly popping up on the flank to interact with Bernardo Silva and cross into the box.</p>
      <p>This is a big change form 2017/18 when he floated, in tandem with David Silva, into central attacking midfield and built City’s attacks through the central column of the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Belgian’s new role is certainly a peculiar tactical switch for Guardiola to have made considering the club’s extraordinary success over the previous two years.</p>
      <p>Without De Bruyne in central areas City are unable to build so fluidly into the final third, and with De Bruyne out on the right they are too frequently relying on crossing the ball; no doubt De Bruyne's delivery is excellent - witness his assist for the opening goal against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> - but it doesn't suit the overall side and crossing has become too predominant.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>So far, City top the Premier League charts for crosses attempted: 323 in total, 27 per game.</p>
      <p>That not only reflects De Bruyne’s changing influence but a desperate ‘plan B’ that has surfaced in recent weeks; when needing a late goal, City are resorting to repeatedly pumping the ball into the box, with mixed results.</p>
      <p>In recent campaigns sitting in a deep defensive blockade didn’t work against Guardiola teams.</p>
      <p>But this season opponents are increasingly realising they can frustrate City by patiently inviting pressure; <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> held out for 70 minutes earlier this month by retreating into a shell and Man City responded by attempting 62 crosses.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>This secondary tactical plan lacks guile and has led to a downturn in the attacking rhythms that have been this City side's forte and a substantial decrease in what was once City’s archetypal goal: short passing on one flank to drag the opponent across, a sudden diagonal switch that opens space, a run to the byline meeting a ball in behind, followed by a cut-back for a tap-in.</p>
      <p>City don’t do this anymore, partly because De Bruyne isn’t in the right place to play the killer through ball - often crossing from a position deeper on the right - partly because of Leroy Sane’s season-ending injury, and partly because 33-year-old David Silva’s influence is beginning to wane.</p>
      <p>It would be a mistake, of course, to overstate these issues. They were extremely unlucky to draw 2-2 with Spurs, lost in freak circumstances to Norwich, and should feel no shame in losing at Anfield.</p>
      <p>In fact, given Liverpool have a hectic December schedule of 10 games in 30 days and continue to squeeze through matches (outperforming their xG to such an extent their ‘xPoints’ reads 10 fewer than reality), Man City could yet win the title. One Liverpool defeat, cutting the lead to six points, would shift the narrative.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But the problems are real, and do need fixing. Unfortunately, this weekend’s opponents <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> have just as likely to inflict further damage as provide City with an opportunity to heal.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s carefree Chelsea prioritise quick vertical passes into the final third, their 4-2-3-1 using inverted wingers to bunch up in the No.10 space.</p>
      <p>Racing chaotically forward on the counter - but happy to sit back when the hosts have the ball - Chelsea could be just the team to further highlight City’s softness through the middle and their confusion at the back.</p>
      <p>Then again, Guardiola loves opponents who come to the Eithad to play, and Chelsea’s decompression between the lines continues to cause problems for them in the transitions.</p>
      <p>Man City obviously have the world-class attacking talent to outscore Chelsea if the match descends into chaos.</p>
      <p>It promises to be a crucial moment in the title race.</p>
      <p>Defeat for Man City could, as Liverpool fade out of view, trigger a psychological downturn that exacerbates their emerging tactical concerns, whereas victory would provide a short-term lift.</p>
      <p>But what City really need goes a little deeper.</p>
      <p>They need new signings and new ideas if the Guardiola era is to get back to the record-breaking heights of the previous two years.</p>
