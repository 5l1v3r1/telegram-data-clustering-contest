      <p><b>CANTON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The mayor's race in an Ohio village has once again been decided by a coin flip.</p>
      <p>The Canton Repository reports Travis Boyd's call of heads Thursday at the Stark County Board of Elections has won him a seat as mayor of Magnolia for the next four years.</p>
      <p>An election Nov. 5 left Boyd and opponent Grant Downes tied at 147 votes each. The two men shook hands after the flip.</p>
      <p>"It's a giant relief, to tell you the truth, that this is over for sure," Boyd said.</p>
      <p>Downes took the defeat in stride while acknowledging the final result was disappointing.</p>
      <p>"We're all competitive," he said. "But it's still going to be a good outcome. Travis is going to do a good job for us."</p>
      <p>The men ran for the position after longtime Mayor Robert Leach decided not to seek reelection. Leach was elected the Magnolia mayor in 1979 after winning, that's right, a coin flip. He ran unopposed for his next nine terms.</p>
      <p>Magnolia's population is just under 1,000 people. It's roughly 70 miles (120 kilometers) south of Cleveland.</p>
