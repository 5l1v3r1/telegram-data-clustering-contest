      <p>Now that it's late November, we're basically in the midst of Christmas. It's time banish that niggling Grinch-Esque phase, "It's too early", it's time to get the tree up, wrap up those pressies and jam as many Christmas themed events in as possible. Cue, the first-ever Guinness Winterfest.</p>
      <p>This December, the <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/dspca-condemn-video-chicken-pint-guinness-342588"><i>Guinness</i></a> Open Gate Brewery will be transformed into an extraordinary Christmas festival, complete with a seasonally inspired line-up of entertainment.</p>

      <p>You can expect a jam-packed evening full of festive fun, if you will. Just like other amazing <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/first-ever-christmas-market-held-dublin-castle-next-month-343519"><i>Christmas markets</i></a> around Ireland, there's plenty of stalls to browse through for fun and different gifts that go beyond the usual Christmas wish list.</p>
      <p>Expect gorgeous crafts and jewellery, print and quirky cards, apparel and homewares, confectionary and decorations and more.</p>
      <p>As for the foodies, there's even more to enjoy. With everything from sweet to savoury, we'll be making a bee-line for the bubbling cheese toasties, followed by the churros with chocolate dip.</p>
