      <h2>Toyota's revamped C-HR compact crossover is more enjoyable than ever and the Japanese marque is obviously looking for big slices of the hybrid and SUV markets. You can find out all about the specs, performances and prices of the refreshed model here.</h2>

      <p>PASSION and emotion aren’t words that necessarily spring to mind when you think of a car – but try telling that to Toyota. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/toyota">The Japanese marque</a> is both passionate and emotional about the new C-HR model.</p>
      <p>After its initial launch in 2016, Toyota’s first compact crossover, or Coupe High-Rider to give it its proper title, went on to become a hit, selling an impressive 400,000 units, with 50,000 sold in the UK alone – accounting for 40 per cent of the UK’s “alternative fuelled” market.</p>
      <p>Takatomo Suzuki, the chief engineer of the new C-HR, explained that Toyota wanted to “refine core values” and make the new C-HR “more dynamic, more premium and more capable”.</p>

      <p>Designed and styled in Brussels, and with 50million euros spent on development, Toyota has high expectations for its revamped C-HR.</p>
      <p>So the Far East car giant is aiming straight at the competitive European market. As a result, Toyota expects to take about eight per cent of the market share and hopes to attract new customers to the brand.</p>
      <p>Styling is always subjective but there’s no denying that the C-HR has a distinctive design. In fact, while test driving the new model in Portugal, its sleek looks merited several curious head turns.</p>

      <p>Subtle design changes, including a wider front grille, new bumper, repositioned fog lights and new LED lights front and rear, all help the new 2020 C-HR create a strong road presence.</p>
      <p>With new, improved suspension and shock absorbers, Toyota is aiming to make the C-HR a more engaging drive.</p>
      <p>Enhanced power steering, better handling and improved driving dynamics all help, making for a pleasant and fun experience at the wheel. And with a low centre of gravity, body roll is almost non-existent.</p>

      <p>The new C-HR is also more refined than before thanks to noise reduction and engine insulation measures. Meanwhile, the CVT automatic gearbox provides a smooth ride.</p>
      <p>The interior hasn’t changed too drastically, with functionality and usability still prominent. Materials are solid and well made, with the soft-touch door panels and dashboard interspersed with some durable plastic.</p>

      <p>The eight-inch multimedia touchscreen is easy to operate and comes with an optional 800watt JBL premium audio system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity are now standard and sync up easily with the media system.</p>
      <p>With a small back window and thick rear pillars, visibility is slightly restricted but you are thankfully aided by parking sensors and a camera. There’s plenty space for a family of four, although rear headroom is tight for taller adults, due in part to the sloping roofline.</p>
      <p>Toyota has fitted a plethora of enhanced safety features as standard, including a pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, road sign assist and lane departure warning. There’s optional adaptive front-lighting and blind spot monitor.</p>

      <p>With a choice of colours and bi-tone variables on offer, you should be able to create a C-HR to suit your tastes. The newcomer is also the latest Toyota model in the UK to be more environmentally friendly – it’s become all-hybrid.</p>
      <p>The full petrol-electric hybrid system works well, offering a good balance of combined efficiency and power. Alongside a new smaller electric motor, there are two powertrains available – a 1.8-litre and an all-new 2.0-litre.</p>
      <p>The 1.8-litre delivers 122bhp, 54 to 58mpg, CO2 emissions of 86 to 100g/km and 0-62mph in 11 seconds, with a top speed of 105mph.</p>

      <p>I tested the top-of-the-range £32,595 Orange Edition, which had a smooth yet punchy 2.0-litre unit delivering 184bhp, returning 49 to 54mpg and emitting 92 to 118g/km of CO2.</p>
      <p>The 0-62mph dash is achieved in 8.2 seconds, with a maximum speed of 112mph. Toyota says the new 2.0-litre will produce 80 per cent zero emissions in urban areas. The Orange Edition will have a limited run of only 500 units for the UK, with the C-HR arriving on our shores early next year.</p>
      <p>Prices start at £25,625 for the base 1.8-litre Icon model and all variants come with a five-year warranty as standard. Packed with gadgets and gizmos, the new, refined C-HR hybrid is poised to ride high.</p>
