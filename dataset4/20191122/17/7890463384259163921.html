      <h1>Microsoft Flight Simulator isn’t “legally problematic,” despite depicting the entire world</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:14:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Carrie Talbot</a></address>

        <b>With <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/microsoft-flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> drawing on real-world satellite imagery to generate the world (yes, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/microsoft-flight-simulator/map">including your house</a>), you’d think its devs at Asobo Studios might run into all kinds of tricky legal issues in developing it. Not so, according to Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann – because the sim’s based on pictures, “and the pictures are true.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an interview with PCGamesN at X019, we asked Neumann whether the Microsoft Flight Simulator devs ran into any legal or privacy-related issues when building a map of the entire world, to which he replied no. “The only thing that’s legally problematic, really, is borders, country names – and we have none of that. We just have the pictures. And the pictures are true.”</p>
      <p>Given the flight sim’s satellite imagery – taken from Microsoft-owned Bing’s maps and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/microsoft-flight-simulator/map">combined</a> with cloud processing – will recreate the world as it looks, this means it should be free of any potential questions around country or region naming. An example of this was raised during a spate of <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/review-bomb">Warframe review bombs</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>You can get a sneak peek at the world through Microsoft Flight Simulator’s eyes in the X019 trailer below:</p>

      <p>Neumann also revealed at the Xbox show that the sim’s use of <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/microsoft-flight-simulator/bing">Bing’s mapping data</a> is not just a one-way street – “we actually give some stuff back to Bing.”</p>
      <p>Neumann also told us that scientists and military veterans are helping make <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/microsoft-flight-simulator/accessibility">Microsoft Flight Simulator accessible</a> to everyone, with the idea of “Leave no pilot behind” being the studio’s goal.</p>
