      <h2>Focusing on companies with "wide moats" can set you up for decades of successful investing.</h2>

      <h3>Q: I've been reading about <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/warren-buffett-stocks-investing-advice.aspx">Warren Buffett's investing style</a>, and one concept that he's mentioned often is looking for sustainable competitive advantages, or a "wide moat," in stocks he buys. Aside from looking at Buffett's portfolio, how can I find stocks with wide moats?</h3>
      <p>First, to help understand the term "wide moat," think about a castle in the Middle Ages. If the castle had a wide moat, it wasn't easy for invaders to get in. Similarly, if a company has a durable competitive advantage, it's not easy for competitors to steal its market share.</p>
      <p>These competitive advantages come in several forms, and if you can identify one or more of these in a company, it could be worthy of a closer look for your portfolio.</p>
      <p>Cost advantages are an example. This can mean that a company can profitably sell a product at a lower cost than its competitors, or that it has a lower cost structure than its peers, or that it has the ability to charge more than rivals for the same type of product. Think of companies like <b>Coca-Cola</b>. Its large and efficient distribution network allows it to move its products all over the world in a cost-effective way, and its brand power allows it to charge more than other soft drink brands.</p>
      <p>Network effects can be another extremely durable moat. Consider <b>Facebook</b>: The social network has more than 2 billion users, and if people want to keep up with their friends, they almost <i>have</i> to use Facebook.</p>
      <p>There are several other advantages you can look for as well. For example, if a company owns valuable intellectual property like patents, it can be a big advantage. If it's expensive to stop using a company's product in favor of a competitor (high switching costs), it can also be a major advantage.</p>
      <p>If you apply these concepts to stocks you have your eye on, you'll be able to separate those companies with great businesses <i>now</i> from companies that will still have great businesses tomorrow.</p>
