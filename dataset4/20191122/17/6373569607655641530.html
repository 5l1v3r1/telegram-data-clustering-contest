      <p>A Plymouth woman is devastated after she believes her beloved dog was stolen from a Plymouth street.</p>
      <p>Local lady Diane Green, 73, was walking her dogs along Norwich Avenue in <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/whitleigh">Whitleigh </a>when her shih tzu was allegedly stolen on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>Mrs Green told Plymouth Live: "Somebody took her. I was walking along the pavement with my other dog - and she, my shih tzu, was walking behind me," but when Mrs Green turned around, her dog was 'gone'.</p>
      <p>Mrs Green believes her dog, named Kizzy, has been stolen, but didn't see anybody abduct her.</p>
      <p>Mrs Green is heartbroken and is offering a reward for the safe return of the stolen dog.</p>

      <p>Mrs Green told Plymouth Live: "Somebody's taken her, I was walking along the pavement with my other dog - and she, my shih tzu, was walking behind me."</p>
      <p>Mrs Green's daughter-in-law, Vicky Green added: "When she turned around, she [Kizzy the dog] was gone."</p>
      <p>Kizzy the dog 'never ever runs away from me,' says Mrs Green, and 'always stays behind me and always keeps her eye on me'.</p>
      <p>She said: "My dog knows this place [Whitleigh] back to front. If I had left her there, she would be able to get home, [she hasn't] so somebody's taken her."</p>
      <p>The incident is thought to have happened at 3.30pm on Saturday, November 16 at Norwich Avenue in Whitleigh.</p>
      <p>The dog is a small black and white 'going grey' shih tzu named Kizzy, who is 13 years old and has one eye missing.</p>
      <p>Kizzy also has a 'large lump on her side' and wears a pink collar with no tag, Mrs Green says. Kizzy is also chipped.</p>
      <p>Mrs Green says she's having panic attacks from the stress of her missing dog.</p>
      <p>Mrs Green said: "She's been with me all her life - this is breaking my heart, it could kill me off.</p>
      <p>"I'm having panic attacks because of it."</p>
      <p>There are posters around the area and everyone knows Kizzy, says Mrs Green, but no one has come forward with her missing dog.</p>
      <p>She is offering a reward for her shih tzu's safe return.</p>
      <p>"Please, please bring her back, bring her back home," she added.</p>
      <p>If you have any information about Mrs Green's missing dog, please contact the police on 101@dc.police.uk, quoting crime reference CR-105337-19.</p>
