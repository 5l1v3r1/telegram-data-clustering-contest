      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caroline-flack/">Caroline Flack</a> was living her absolute best life as she stripped down to enjoy a glass of champagne in a steaming hot bubble bath as part of her latest photoshoot.</p>
      <p>And she was clearly unafraid to show it off on Instagram.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> presenter shared a video to her 2.3 million followers of her drinking champagne while in the bath, posing up a storm as she had her picture taken for the camera.</p>

      <p>It’s possible she might be a Lady Gaga fan, as her hit single Just Dance could be heard playing in the background. Or perhaps Caroline was taking inspiration from the singer herself, after she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/21/lady-gagas-gruelling-post-show-ice-baths-put-athlete-shame-10956639/">previously showed off her ice cold baths</a> on her own Instagram page?</p>
      <p>‘I take baths really seriously, shoot TBC,’ she captioned the post.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long until fans rushed to the comments to compliment Caroline on her looks.</p>
      <p>‘Whoa this is steamy,’ one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>‘Oh Caroline!! Stop it,’ another added.</p>

      <p>‘Go on girl!!’ another fan commented.</p>
      <p>While some fans seemed concerned she was about to spill her champagne into the bath.</p>
      <p>‘I was so worried you were going to spill your drink!’ one said.</p>
      <p>Another chipped in: ‘I couldn’t stop thinking…… don’t spill ur drink in the bath!’</p>
      <p>But thankfully, the drink remained intact.</p>
      <p>Caroline previously teased she was shooting something ‘exciting’, as she also shared a behind the scenes glamour shot from the shoot to Instagram.</p>

      <p>‘Shooting something so so exciting today,’ she wrote.</p>
      <p>Asides from exciting photoshoots, the 40-year-old has also given us another reason to be excited: she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caroline-flack-heads-cape-town-filming-winter-love-island-officially-begins-11181828/">recently flew to Cape Town</a> to begin filming for the upcoming winter series of Love Island.</p>
      <p>Although she previously told <b>Metro.co.uk</b> that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/caroline-flack-dreading-juggling-winter-love-island-in-south-africa-and-uk-aftersun-as-filming-kicks-off-this-weekend-11091430/">she is not looking forward to flying back and forth from South Africa</a> once the series commences.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘It’s a 13 hour flight [to South Africa],’ she said. ‘I’ve got to go back and forth the whole time do Aftersun over here.’</p>
      <p>She also added that it’s a ‘long old flight just do that walking’ – but we’re convinced it will be worth it for her iconic slow-mo walks.</p>
