      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:34:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>This weekend will be a special occasion for the Iowa Hawkeyes as they’ll honor their seniors in the final home game of the season. It’ll be an emotional day for the upperclassmen, but they’ll need to be ready for war against the Illinois Fighting Illini.</p>
      <p>Iowa handed Minnesota its first loss of the season in Week 12 due to its tenacious defense. Nathan Stanley also played well, completing 14-of-23 pass attempts for 173 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Last season, the Hawkeyes dismantled the Fighting Illini on the road. Head coach Lovie Smith told the media that he remembers the 63-0 beatdown his team suffered.</p>
      <p>Illinois is already eligible for a bowl game this season, but Smith believes the team hasn’t reached its ceiling yet. He’s hoping the Fighting Illini can play spoiler on Iowa’s senior day.</p>
      <p>Both defenses have played very well this season, so it’s possible that it’s a low-scoring game.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for this weekend’s Iowa-Illinois showdown:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>Big Ten Network</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spread: </b>
        <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112155">Iowa -15.5</a>
      </p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>47</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Kevin Kugler, Matt Millen</p>
      <p>In order for Illinois to pull off the upset on Saturday, quarterback Brandon Peters will need to be sharp against an Iowa defense that surrenders only 196.6 passing yards per game.</p>
      <p>As for Iowa, the team performs best when it jumps out to an early lead and then allows superstar defensive end A.J. Epenesa to get after the opposing quarterback.</p>
      <p>Will the Hawkeyes send off their seniors with a win, or will the Fighting Illini avenge last season’s loss?</p>
