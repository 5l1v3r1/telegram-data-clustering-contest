      <h1>Ireland Will Discover Venue For Slovakia Playoff Match Next Month</h1>

        <b>The Republic of Ireland’s route to Euro 2020 is now clear.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side must beat <b>Slovakia</b> away in a one-legged playoff on March 26. If they come through that tie, they will play the winner of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> versus <b>Northern Ireland</b> in a final on March 31 for a spot at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/ireland-euro-2020-playoff-northern-ireland/">Ireland will be away from home in both games</a>, which means they could end up playing Northern Ireland in Belfast at Windsor Park for a place at the tournament next summer.</p>
      <p>After scoring just seven goals in qualifying, and failing to beat Denmark and Switzerland across four games, the matches in March won’t be easy for McCarthy’s side.</p>

      <p>The Ireland manager has said as much. McCarthy reckons that fans should not dismiss Slovakia, who are ranked 31st in the world, because, like the Boys in Green, they also finished third in their group. (As it stands, Ireland are currently 4/1 with some bookmakers to reach Euro 2020).</p>
      <p>“It’s a tough game,” <a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/ireland-will-face-northern-ireland-or-bosnia-away-in-euro-2020-playoffs-if-they-beat-slovakia-following-nightmare-draw-38716266.html">McCarthy told reporters</a> in Nyon, Switzerland ahead of the Euro 2020 playoff draw.</p>
      <blockquote>“People have said to me ‘You’ll be playing one of the poorer sides, one of the third teams in the group’ and I said ‘Yes, exactly like us’.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Ireland manager also said that Slovakia have the advantage in the tie because they will be playing at home.</p>
      <p>“That has an impact on it, the venue, the crowd getting behind them, the fact that they feel happier at home and don’t have to travel. That does have an impact and influence, whether it has such a big influence, we will see.</p>
      <blockquote>“It will be a difficult game, I have no doubt. They were in Wales’ group so I am sure I will be able to get info on them, though we can get it anyway from our analysts.”</blockquote>

      <p>Following the playoff draw, <a href="https://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/mccarthy-we-know-what-we-have-to-do">McCarthy</a> reiterated that the semi-final against Slovakia is the team’s only concern at the moment. And, if they come through that tie, Ireland will “fancy their chances anywhere else” – away to Bosnia or in Belfast against Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“We will have our analysis done on all three teams, but our focus is on Slovakia first and getting ready for them in the New Year,” the Ireland manager said after Friday’s draw.</p>
      <blockquote>“We know what we have to do, we have to go there and win the game. Home advantage is just that but if we play as well as we did against Denmark then I will settle for that. We set the bar high on Monday night and that is the standard we will have to play at to win two games.”</blockquote>

      <p>Meanwhile, on December 20, Ireland will discover the venue for the match against Slovakia. The Slovaks played their home qualification games in Trnava while a new stadium was being built in Bratislava.</p>
      <p>The national team played their first match at the venue in Bratislava, the Tehelné pole stadium, in October, a friendly game against Paraguay, and the stadium is expected to host Ireland in March.</p>
      <p>The fixture details will be confirmed next month. Irish fans are currently guaranteed five per cent of the tickets for the 22,500-seat stadium, but the FAI have said they will attempt to get more tickets for travelling supporters.</p>

      <p>The FAI released a statement on the situation, which <a href="https://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/mccarthy-we-know-what-we-have-to-do">reads</a>:</p>
      <p>“Slovakia have intimated the game will take place in Bratislava but they have some final checks to make on the ground there before they can confirm it as the venue.</p>
      <p>“We have also opened talks with them on the allocation of tickets and will update our fans as soon as we can. We are guaranteed 5 per cent of the tickets but we are negotiating for more.</p>
      <p>“Tickets will be allocated to supporters based on away attendance records from the last two campaigns. We will announce the application process as soon as we know our allocation.”</p>
