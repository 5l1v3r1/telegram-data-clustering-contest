      <p>Residents on Roberts Road in Lake Country were asked to leave their homes yesterday after police responded to a call about a distraught man.</p>
      <p>The incident started at about 5:45 p.m. yesterday, Nov. 21, when police were called, according to an RCMP media release. When they arrived, they found the man in a wooded area and noted he had a weapon so they shut down the street and evacuated nearby homes.</p>
      <p>The RCMP Crisis Negotiation Team was called in to speak to the man, who surrendered about four hours later, RCMP said.</p>
      <p>No charges have been laid in the case.</p>
