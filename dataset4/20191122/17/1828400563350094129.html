      <p>PCSOs Trevor Sterling and Richard Fisher from Kirkham Police station gave a presentation to the children in class.</p>
      <p>Wesham town councillor Louise Walker, inset, lives on the same road and her seven-year-old son William attends the school.</p>
      <p>She has campaigned before to catch motorists speeding through the town.</p>
      <p>She said: “We walked the children to the junction at Mowbreck Lane and Garstang Road North which is a hotspot for speeders despite it being 20mph.</p>

      <p>“All the children had a go on the gun and most motorists did between 20- 28 mph.</p>
      <p>“The worst offender was caught by one of the children. child caught was 32 mph</p>
      <p>“It was by a local coach company. I as a councillor will be informing said company about their speeding in a very vulnerable area.”</p>
      <p>Coun Walker said the children ‘absolutely enjoyed’ the experience and loved when drivers stayed at the legal speed limit.</p>
      <p>However, she added: “One disgruntled driver who was signalled to slow at 31mph got out of his car to complain about it.</p>
      <p>“I shall continue to campaign and push Lancashire County Council for some slowing system and I will continue to try push to educate kids on dangers of speeding.”</p>
