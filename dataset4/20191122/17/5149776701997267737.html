      <p>"Unfortunately, in order to allow the works to take place, the path that runs between Tesco and the bus/tram interchange will be closed permanently from Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>"This will allow access to the utilities that run underneath it so they can be diverted to make way for the main construction work.</p>
      <p>"We ran a consultation on this earlier this year. A new replacement path will be created as part of the new development."</p>
