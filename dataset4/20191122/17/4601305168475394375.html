      <p>This Coke can disappearing act is a fun experiment that reveals the hidden layer inside the soda's packaging.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://melscience.com/US-en/articles/secret-aluminum-can-what-it-hiding/">MEL Science</a>, who posted their own version of this experiment in May, Coke is packaged in two layers of protective material, and only one of them can withstand drain cleaner.</p>
      <blockquote>This or­di­nary alu­minum can is con­ceal­ing a de­vi­ous se­cret – it is cov­ered with a pro­tec­tive lay­er not only on the out­side, but on the in­side as well! When we re­move its paint coat­ing, we ex­pose the alu­minum, which eas­i­ly re­acts with a drain clean­er that con­tains an al­ka­line com­po­nent. But even when the alu­minum has dis­solved com­plete­ly, the drink will not leak out. There is a sec­ond ma­te­ri­al in­side the can – a lay­er of plas­tic that keeps the drink it­self from in­ter­act­ing with the alu­minum.</blockquote>
      <p>If you try it yourself, MEL Science adds a safety precaution: "Wear pro­tec­tive gloves, glass­es, and a mask. Work in a well-ven­ti­lat­ed area. Per­form this ex­per­i­ment un­der adult su­per­vi­sion only!"</p>
