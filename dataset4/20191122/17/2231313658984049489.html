      <h1>Ask a Fool: Is a Covered Call a Risk-Free Income Strategy?</h1>
      <h2>A covered call can reduce your risk and provide income, but it comes at a price.</h2>

      <h3>Q: I've been learning about options and am thinking about writing covered calls against some of the stocks in my portfolio. It seems like this is a pretty risk-free way to generate income -- what's the catch?</h3>
      <p>First off, for those who aren't familiar, a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/21/what-is-a-covered-call.aspx">covered call</a> essentially means that you sell someone else the right to buy a <a href="https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/stocks.aspx">stock you own</a>. As an example, if Company X trades for $65 per share and you own 100 shares, you might sell a call option that allows another investor to buy your shares at $70 each anytime within the next two months. In exchange for selling this right, you receive a payment.</p>
      <p>It's true that covered calls are a risk-free income strategy in the sense that once you sell the contract, the payment you receive is your to keep, no matter what happens.</p>
      <p>To understand the downside, consider the three things that can happen <i>after</i> you sell the covered call:</p>
      <p>First, the stock could go down, in which case the option expires worthless. You keep the premium and your loss is less than it otherwise would have been.</p>
      <p>Second, the stock could go up, but remain below the contract price (called the "strike" price). The option expires worthless, your stock is worth more, <i>and</i> you get to keep the money you collected for selling the option.</p>
      <p>Third, the stock could rise to a price greater than the strike price before expiration. You still keep the option income, but you're now forced to sell your shares for less than the current market value. <i>This</i> is the potential drawback of selling covered calls against your stocks.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, covered calls can be a great income strategy, but they're not a free lunch. You're essentially giving up some of your upside potential in exchange for income. This can still be a desirable arrangement for some investors, especially if income is your priority, but it's important to be aware of what happens if your stock jumps higher.</p>
