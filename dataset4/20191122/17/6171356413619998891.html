      <h1>Nokia teases new phone set to be unveiled on December 5th</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:46:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/zach-laidlaw/" target="_blank">Zach Laidlaw</a></address>
      <p>Nokia may be far from its <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2013/06/25/three-weeks-with-the-nokia-lumia-928-an-in-depth-look-from-an-android-perspective/">Lumia heyday</a> of the early 2010s, but the iconic phone manufacturer still has some tricks up its sleeve. According to a post on Nokia's official Twitter page, the next handset in its <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/01/nokias-comeback-explained-historic-phone-company-suddenly-making-android-phones/">Android resurgence</a> is poised to make its debut as soon as December 5th.</p>
      <p>Nokia hasn't provided much to go on, aside from this vague video teaser. The only glimpse we see of what <i>could</i> be the phone is a rectangular outline with rounded edges laid atop a mountainous horizon. The silhouette alludes to a possible bezeless display, which would be a welcome change to Nokia's <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/07/18/nokia-x5-jumps-notch-bandwagon-modest-specs-fitting-price/">recent notched designs</a>, though what we're seeing could purely be a marketing stunt. What we <i>do</i> know is that Nokia is great at providing a <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/02/26/nokia-brings-back-lumias-beloved-camera-pro-android-devices/">premium camera experience</a>, so this next device will likely be packing a sufficient camera array.</p>

      <p>Given that most phone manufacturers have already wrapped up their high-end 2019 hardware pipelines and are gearing up for the retail holiday season, this device is probably aimed at the lesser lauded mid-tier market, like the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/05/nokia-8-1-launches-as-global-edition-of-chinas-nokia-x7-sporting-a-snapdragon-710-for-e399/">Nokia 8.1 that was released around this time last year</a>. We'll have more to say when the phone lands on December 5th. so be on the lookout for an update.</p>
