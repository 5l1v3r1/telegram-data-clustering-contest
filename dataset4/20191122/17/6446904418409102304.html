      <p>TWO RAPISTS WHO hugged and high-fived each other while their 23-year-old female victim lay in extreme pain in the toilets of a Soho nightclub have each been jailed for seven-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>Ferdinando Orlando, 25, and Lorenzo Costanzo, 26, both Italian nationals, were arrested after police discovered them re-enacting the attack on the club’s CCTV recordings.</p>
      <p>Officers searched through hours of footage to find the moment they graphically re-enacted what they had earlier done to the woman in the maintenance room of the Toy Room club on Argyll Street in central London on 26 February 2017.</p>
      <p>CCTV also caught the two men watching back footage they had taken of the attack on a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Police said the two men escaped justice for more than a year by returning to Italy, but they were eventually caught after Costanzo travelled to the UK to watch an Arsenal versus AC Milan football match in 2018.</p>
      <p>A jury found them guilty of two counts of rape each following a trial.</p>
      <p>Sentencing the pair at Isleworth Crown Court today, Judge Giles Curtis-Raleigh said they had committed “very serious offences” against “an entirely innocent and vulnerable young woman”.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Rebecca Woodsford, from the Metropolitan Police, said she had informed the victim of the sentence over the phone.</p>
      <p>Speaking on her behalf, the officer said: “It does matter to her but it was the conviction, and that the jury believed her, is what she has taken away from this.”</p>
      <p>In an impact statement, the victim said the rape had left her in “constant fear” and unable to relax or enjoy drinking with friends when she goes out.</p>

      <p>She has no memory of the attack and only learned of its full details during the trial.</p>
      <p>The victim said:</p>
      <blockquote>I truly struggle with how two humans could behave like such animals to another person and think of that as funny and like a badge of honour.</blockquote>
      <p>Police said CCTV footage from the night of the attack showed the defendants each kissing and dancing with the victim, who was visibly drunk and unsteady on her feet.</p>
      <p>Within eight minutes of first meeting her, they walked her to the maintenance room, where there were no cameras, and raped her.</p>
      <p>Police and prosecutors argued the woman’s condition meant she was unable to consent to sex.</p>
      <p>Orlando and Costanzo admitted filming the incident, but claimed they had consensual sex with the victim.</p>
      <p>About 16 minutes later, the pair re-emerged with their victim, but they abandoned her in the female toilets before running off.</p>
      <p>She was found by club staff in severe pain and helped home by concerned strangers.</p>

      <p>She later went to hospital and required surgery on an injury.</p>
      <p>The judge said medical evidence in the trial did not show how the injury happened so he would not sentence the defendants on the basis they caused it.</p>
      <p>He said the pair had acted together and displayed “triumphalist behaviour”, with the attack having “very considerable psychological harm” on the victim.</p>
      <p>Mitigating, Sarah Elliott QC, representing Orlando, said he was a “fundamentally decent… young man who made a colossal error of judgment”.</p>
      <p>Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, representing Costanzo, said he was of “previous exemplary character” and there had been no “malice” or “force” but a “terrible error of misjudgment”.</p>
      <p>Both said the two men, who have no previous convictions, felt “regret” and “remorse”.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Toy Room nightclub said it was “appalled” by the incident.</p>
      <p>He added: “The safety of our guests is our top priority, and we’ve done everything we can to co-operate fully with the police to help them bring this case to trial and ensure a conviction.”</p>
