        <b>Cork boxer Gary 'Spike' O'Sullivan is set for a huge fight against unbeaten Mexican Jaime Munguia in a headline bout at the Alamadome in San Antonio, Texas, on January 11.</b>
      </p>
      <p>O'Sullivan [30-3. 21KOs] recently moved to light-middleweight, where he's won twice, but he'll return to 160 pounds for the contest with Munguia [34-0, 27KOs].</p>
      <p>The fight will be Munguia's middleweight debut.</p>
      <p>Munguia has successfully defended the light-middleweight world title five times, most recently in September.</p>
      <p>Munguia, 23, has long been linked with a move up to middleweight.</p>
      <p>O'Sullivan, 36, recently told <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/sport/exclusive-spike-osullivan-film-world-title-dreams-339724"><i>BuzzSport</i></a> about his goal to win a world title but this high-profile bout will be massive for the Mahon native.</p>
      <p>It will be broadcast live on DAZN in the US and possible Sky Sports in Europe.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's a dream come true to fight the undefeated champion of the world, and the number one ranked fighter in the world," O'Sullivan said. "It makes it even better that he's Mexican. I grew up watching the great Mexican champions, and to get the opportunity to fight Jaime is an honor. I will leave no stone unturned in my preparation for this fight. I can't recall feeling more motivated by any other fight in my career thus far. I believe this fight will be a war that the fans will talk about for many years to come."</p>
