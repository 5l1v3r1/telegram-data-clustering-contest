      <h1>A Swansea business is letting homeless people say they live there so they can vote in the General Election 2019</h1>
      <h2>Without a registered address, people can not get on the electoral register</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:02:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Nino Williams</a></address>
      <p>A Swansea business is using its premises to give homeless people the chance to vote.</p>
      <p>The deadline to register to vote in next month’s general election is November 26, after which anyone who is eligible but who hasn’t registered will not be able to cast a vote.</p>
      <p>But to register, people need to have a registered address, which instantly excludes the homeless.</p>
      <p>However, independent business Cinema &amp; Co has taken inspiration from <a href="https://www.bristol247.com/news-and-features/news/city-centre-bar-allows-homeless-people-to-use-their-address-so-they-can-vote-in-general-election/?fbclid=IwAR1-OZH9-A3S-YFYKVvg2oUJCp73ak5OzCzk58RhMt-ljhkSD93UhHoU-fk">another business in Bristol</a> , which has offered to help rough sleepers by letting them use its address, and so enabling them to vote.</p>
      <p>Cinema &amp; Co owner Anna Redfern said: “It’s more important than ever to vote in the upcoming general election and especially to give a voice to those who can no longer exercise their basic human rights, let alone their right to vote.</p>
      <p>“We sincerely hope that providing a safe place for the homeless to register will empower them to have a say in such a vital decision”.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission confirmed that people who didn’t have a permanent home could register to vote at an address where they spent a part of their time, such as a shelter or night shelter, or a friend’s place.</p>

      <p>Cinema &amp; Co is inviting homeless people to visit the business in Castle Street on Monday, November 25, when they can fill out a voter registration form which will be submitted on their behalf.</p>
      <p>They will also screen a Christmas themed film, at 1pm, and provide hot drinks.</p>
      <p>Homeless charity Crisis is also offering advice for rough sleepers who want to vote, <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-help/information-for-crisis-members/member-news/how-to-register-to-vote-if-you-re-homeless/?fbclid=IwAR0LrSC5352ytzhHnezwwK0WRxM1PJVF2JHge-nBmPW37fbFPLXYTsgzHDE">here</a> .</p>
