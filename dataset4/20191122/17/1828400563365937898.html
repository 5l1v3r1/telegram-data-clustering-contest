      <h2>A promise to give Blackpool residents free admission to attractions has come under fire after inquiries revealed no  record of formal discussions in relation to the plan.</h2>

      <p>The town's Labour group included the pledge in its manifesto ahead of the May local elections when it retained control of the town hall for a third term.</p>
      <p>A Freedom of Information (FOI) request asking about progress on the scheme has found all discussions so far have been informal and there are no written guarantees.</p>
      <p>But council leader Coun Simon Blackburn says the scheme remains on track to be introduced ahead of the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>Bispham resident Paul Siddall submitted an FOI in October asking the council when the first inquiry had been made to attractions about the proposals.</p>
      <p>Mr Siddall also wanted to see documents relating to each attraction's response, details of meetings and the cost to existing financial budgets.</p>
      <p>In its response the council was unable to provide any written documents and admitted the dates of the first inquiries to local attractions are "not recorded".</p>
      <p>The response says: "There have been several informal discussions over the past few months between council officers and local attractions in relation to the free ticket scheme."</p>
      <p>It adds: "All of the discussions to date have been verbal. There are no written responses held by the council."</p>
      <p>There are also "no recorded meetings" in relation to the financing of the scheme, although it is "not intended to impact on council finance budgets".</p>
      <p>In response to Mr Siddall's request for dated copies of all relevant documents in relation to the scheme, the council says: "There is no written documentation held in relation to this matter."</p>
      <p>Coun Blackburn said it was "naive" to think there would be public records of initial confidential meetings.</p>
      <p>He said: “We continue to negotiate with a variety of operators, and it is our intention to launch the scheme prior to the start of the 2020 season, as promised, and as originally planned.</p>
      <p>"It is naive in the extreme to imagine that we would keep public written records of initial and exploratory commercially sensitive discussions.”</p>
      <p>But Mr Siddall said he believed the answers showed Labour had included the pledge just to win votes.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was purely to persuade people to vote for the Labour party.</p>
      <p>"The council can't tell me who has made the contacts and to which attractions.</p>
      <p>"When they publicised it they should have said it would take 12 months, but they chose not to do so in order to persuade people to vote Labour."</p>
      <p>When Labour made the pledge last April as part of its election manifesto, Coun Blackburn said it could be met without any cost to council tax payers.</p>
      <p>He said it was "fully costed and fully deliverable" and that residents would be "able to enjoy a wide and growing list of attractions for free, including free parking, and it won’t cost the council tax payer a penny.”</p>
