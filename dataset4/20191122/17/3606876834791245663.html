Here's what we know about Tom Hanks' net worth.</p>
      <h3>Tom Hanks' net worth is an estimated $400 million .</h3>
      <p>The actor has been a major money maker for a very long time, and in the '90s and early aughts, he was commanding some seriously huge paychecks. Hanks earned <a href="https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celeb/actors/tom-hanks-net-worth/">$40 million </a>for Saving Private Ryan in 1998 and <a href="https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celeb/actors/tom-hanks-net-worth/">$70 million </a>for Forrest Gump in 1994 earnings movie stars rarely see nowadays, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/celebrity-salaries-daniel-craig-jennifer-lawrence-leonardo-dicaprio-1202801717/">Variety </a>.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Hanks earned $45 million, and he placed third on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2010/09/08/depp-stiller-hanks-sandler-business-entertainment-highest-paid-actors.html#671c2fcc1ca8">Forbes </a>' list of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. Movies like Angels &amp; Demons and Larry Crowne contributed to his massive salary, as did HBO's The Pacific, which Hanks produced.</p>
      <p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/599b0ba431358e60d7768f66/12-tom-hanks/#e74a797d0238">Forbes </a>ranked Hanks number 12 on its list of the world's highest-paid actors for his $31 million salary. Hanks could thank his starring roles in Sully, Inferno, and The Circle for his massive earnings that year.</p>
      <p>Awards wise, Hanks earned the Oscar for Best Actor two years in row for 1994's Philadelphia and 1995's Forrest Gump. He also won back-to-back Golden Globes for his work in those movies as well, and he's also landed himself multiple Emmy and SAG awards too.</p>
      <p>In 2019, Hanks reprised his role as Woody in Toy Story 4, and the movie pulled in $434 million domestically and $1.07 billion worldwide. And as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2019/11/21/box-office-how-high-can-tom-hanks-propel-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood/#19167be52fe9">Forbes </a>reports, experts are predicting a $25 million opening weekend A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which is actually above his opening weekend average of $15.3 million.</p>
