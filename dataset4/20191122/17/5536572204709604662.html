      <p>Internet detectives seemed to have found another burner account on Twitter and all signs seemed to point at Nelson Agholor.</p>
      <p>The burner account criticized Carson Wentz and said Nick Foles throws a better football. Agholor, who has been ripped all season for dropping catches, vehemently denied having a burner account when asked by reporters.</p>

      <p>“He was like, ‘This is crazy, somebody talked about you having a burner account, which is nuts,’” said Agholor. “I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ I talked to our PR people and they told me.”</p>
      <p>Agholor asked reporters to put it on Twitter that the account was not his, asking them to tweet, “all right stop playing with Nelson, this wasn’t him.”</p>
      <p>“Social media is a place where you can influence for the positive but once the energy isn’t helpful, there’s no need for it,” said Agholor. “I have to focus on the Eagles, the guys in this locker room, and our loyal fans who need us to play well, and I have to have positive energy. It’s part of eliminating distractions.</p>
      <p>“I hadn’t been on there, wasn’t really active on there. It was my family that was telling me about it. So I was like this makes no sense. They don’t need to be worried about that, so it was unneeded.”</p>
      <p>Agholor, who is set to be a free agent after the 2019 season, has 36 catches for 322 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
