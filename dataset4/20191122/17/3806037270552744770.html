      <h2>The fast-rising Bay Area rapper is on the verge of blowing up.</h2>

      <p>Adding to his current momentum, fast-rising San Francisco rapper <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/lil-bean">Lil Bean</a> continues his ascent by serving up a new visual for his latest major single, “True Colors.” Today’s clip for “True Colors” was put together by director @Mota_Media, and follows Lil Bean and his crew as they enjoy a night out on the town. Notably, the “True Colors” video comes to us in support of Lil Bean’s upcoming full-length project <i>Hood Hero</i>, which is on course to see release next month. The follow-up to July’s <i>Hood Chronicles</i> tape, <i>Hood Hero</i> will deliver 13 new tracks to listeners, including collaborations with fellow northern California artists ShooterGang Kony, Sage the Gemini and ZayBang.</p>
      <p>“Life’s course taught me that some of your close friends can become your distant enemies, And over time whatever feelings someone feels towards you eventually will show,” Lil Bean shares with us, breaking down the theme of “True Colors.”</p>
      <p>“The term ‘Hood Hero’ is not me sayin I’m the ‘Hero of my hood,’ it’s me sayin I’m a Hero from the hood,” Lil Bean adds, opening up about the narrative of his forthcoming full-length. “I feel that we all heroes; we all Kings of where we come from and I think we should own up to that.”</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the @Mota_Media-directed music video for Lil Bean’s new single “True Colors” above, while his next studio album <i>Hood Hero</i> will hit streaming services and similar platforms on December 6. Lil Bean’s <i>Hood Hero</i> LP is also available for pre-order via <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/hoodhero/1488409729">iTunes</a> and other outlets.</p>
