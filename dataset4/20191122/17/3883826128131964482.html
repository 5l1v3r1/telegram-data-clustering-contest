        <b>Eniola Aluko will leave Juventus in December after nearly 18 months with the Serie A champions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The striker, 32, is England Women's joint-10th most capped international, with 102 senior appearances.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Birmingham City forward Aluko was also part of Great Britain's team at the 2012 Olympics.</p>
      <p>"I feel very fortunate to have achieved such success with all of you," she told <a href="https://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2019/thanks-for-everything--eniola-.php">Juventus' website.</a> "I have come to the difficult decision to leave Juventus."</p>
      <p>Aluko, who helped Juve retain their league title last term, added: "My heart is full to know that I have added three trophies at a special club with special memories. I thank you all so much for this."</p>
      <p>She was also part of the side that recently lifted the Italian Supercoppa, having won the Coppa Italia earlier in 2019.</p>
      <p>Her final game for the Turin-based club will be 30 November's meeting with title rivals Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>Aluko told the Guardian that she was "excited to be moving back to London, and back into women's football in England at a time when there are a lot of exciting opportunities" in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/eni-aluko-leave-juventus-early?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">an article on Friday.</a></p>
      <p>She was involved in a discrimination case against former England boss Mark Sampson in 2017 and has not played for the national team since 2016.</p>
      <p>The Football Association apologised to Aluko in October 2017 for racially discriminatory remarks made by the Welshman in 2014.</p>
