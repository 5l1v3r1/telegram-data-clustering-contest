      <p>Tired of being enveloped in low-lying clouds?</p>
      <p>Just drive a few minutes, and the skies will clear.</p>
      <p>Vernon has been under a blanket of grey the last few days while other areas, like neighbouring Coldstream, basked in sunshine.</p>
      <p>Environment Canada meteorologist Bobby Sekhon said the inversion is caused by a ridge of high pressure over the area.</p>
      <p>“That can cause clear conditions in the higher elevations, but that can also mean the moisture closer to the ground gets trapped under the inversion,” said Sekhon. “An inversion is basically temperatures that increases with height and any moisture that is trapped under that, stays under that unless there is something to clear it out.”</p>
      <p>That something is typically warmth from the sun.</p>
      <p>“Now that we are getting close to the winter equinox, we are not feeling as much power from the sun and days are shorter, so we are not getting as much burning off of fog and low cloud from the sun,” said Sekhon.</p>
      <p>“So we have seen that low cloud and fog stick around.”</p>
