      <p>Childhood sweethearts who have been together for decades face the fight of their lives after both received lung cancer diagnoses just weeks apart.</p>
      <p>Lisa and Seth Doyle have been together since they were 18, but they have known each each other since they were 14-years-old in Gloucester, Virginia.</p>
      <p>They said they have gone through good times and bad times together – although nothing as difficult as the cancer diagnosis they both received just five weeks apart.</p>
      <p>Lisa was diagnosed with lung cancer in July after several persistent bouts of bronchitis.</p>
      <p>She told WAVY that the news did not register right away, saying: ‘The doctor said: ‘I’ve been looking at your scans all afternoon and I’m sorry, it’s lung cancer.’</p>

      <p>Seth was optimistic that they would get through wife Lisa’s treatment together – but then he got similar news that was even worse.</p>

      <p>‘But then things took a turn, because my husband was also diagnosed with the same lung cancer. His is terminal, it spread to his brain. He has 14 tumors in his body,’ Lisa said.</p>
      <p>Seth added: ‘I may have a year, a year and a half. I’m scared of what’s going to happen to her, I’m not scared about me dying because I’m going to a better place.’</p>
      <p>‘I’m scared of leaving her here… all by herself, sick, bills rolling in, that’s what scares me the most.’ The couple previously smoked, but have given up, and were exposed to asbestos at work. But no concrete evidence of what caused both to contract the disease was given by doctors.</p>
      <p>They now visit the hospital together, and have shocked staff there with their resilience.</p>

      <p>‘I was giving him the thumbs up, he’s all prepped for surgery, with his blue hat on, I went in first,’ Lisa said.</p>
      <p>‘We wake up in recovery together and you have nurses coming up saying ‘Oh my god, really?’</p>
      <p>She said she has put her chemotherapy on hold as her husband continues radiation.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve known him since I was 14, been together since we were 18, I can’t sit back and do treatment and be fighting for my life and be a positive to live as I watch him die,’ Lisa said.</p>

      <p>‘It’s a chance I’m willing to take, I can’t have both of us back in there laying in the bed. He says he wants me to be happy again, he wants me to go into remission and have a happy life.’</p>
      <p>Seth said: ‘If something happens to me, she’s still young enough. So, it’s not looking good for me, so why should she hold off on her treatment, when I’m not looking anyway? And I think she would, if something happens to me, she’s still young enough.’</p>
