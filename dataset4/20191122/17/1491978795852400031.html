      <p>Grace Millane loved handbags. She had a large collection, her family said, “each one to compliment another outfit she’d be able to just throw on”.</p>
      <p>And so earlier this year, while her devastated parents, two older brothers and wider family struggled to come to terms with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/grace-millane-murder-trial-guilty-new-zealand-man-british-backpacker">the appalling tragedy that had befallen </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/grace-millane-murder-trial-guilty-new-zealand-man-british-backpacker">her</a>, they decided to channel their grief <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lovegrace_uk/">into a project of which she would certainly have approved</a>: filling handbags with essential toiletries and little luxuries and donating them to their local domestic abuse charity in Essex.</p>
      <p>More than 150 bags have been donated so far, greatly exceeding their expectations. To each, a small tag is tied bearing the message, “Love Grace x”.</p>
      <p>On Friday, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/grace-millane-murder-trial-guilty-new-zealand-man-british-backpacker">conviction of a 27-year-old man in New Zealand</a> for Millane’s murder almost exactly a year ago, her family can finally reclaim their daughter from the lurid headlines that have dominated his trial, and remember a young woman whom her devastated father described outside court as “our sunshine”.</p>
      <p>Millane, who was about to turn 22 when she died, had embarked on the trip of a lifetime just weeks before she died, travelling first to Chile, Patagonia and Peru and on to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a>, arriving in Auckland on 29 November, two days before her death.</p>
      <p>Described by her family as a fun-loving free spirit, she had graduated earlier in the year from Lincoln University with a degree in advertising and marketing, but wanted to travel before settling down, undaunted about setting off around the world alone.</p>
      <p>“She had a passion to see the world before she settled into a job,”<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/grace-millane-family-exclusive-our-gorgeous-girl-was-following-her-dream-hxgkqpd0c"> her brother Michael said</a> of the meticulously planned trip. “Her mind was set that she wanted to do this thing.” One of her last acts was to cut off most of her very long hair and donate it to a charity that makes wigs for children undergoing cancer treatment.</p>

      <p>For all her independence, however, Millane was close to her family at home in the village of Ramsden Heath in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/essex">Essex</a>, and was in contact every day by phone or social media with her parents, brothers or other family members.</p>
      <p>Though she was in New Zealand only for a short time, her father, David, said the fact she had “bombarded [them with] numerous photos of her various adventures” showed how much she was loving her visit. The last message she sent her parents was a picture of a Christmas tree, taken on the day she died.</p>
      <p>Throughout the three-week trial of her killer – whom the Guardian still cannot name for legal reasons – Millane’s parents have been obliged to hear lengthy discussions of their daughter’s sexual history and preferences and the dating sites she used, as the defence sought to argue that she had died when a consensual sex game went awry.</p>
      <p>But the jury instead chose to agree with the prosecution barrister who had argued that Millane’s sexual history was irrelevant since “you can’t consent to murder”.</p>
      <p>His daughter’s dating choices, David Millane had told the court, were not even his business. “I don’t believe children tell their parents everything, and nor should they, necessarily.”</p>
      <p>Instead he has made pains to stress that her death “should not deter any man or woman” from following their dreams. “We all fly the nest.”</p>
      <p>And to the many women who have received gifts from the <a href="https://changingpathways.org/">Love Grace</a> project, it is clear that she is still having an impact, according to Philippa Robson, the chief executive of <a href="https://changingpathways.org/">Changing Pathway</a><a href="https://changingpathways.org/">s</a>, the domestic abuse charity to which many of the handbags have been donated.</p>
      <p>“When we give them to the women, it’s quite an emotional process. Just that little bit of luxury changes their day and makes them feel they are valued,” she said.</p>
      <p>A number of women had even taken the “Love Grace” tags to difficult court or police appointments, she said. “Just kind of holding it in their pockets, it’s making them feel valued, that somebody is there, almost rooting for them.”</p>
