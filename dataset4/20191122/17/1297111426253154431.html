      <p>Dickenson was the runner-up for coach-of-the-year.</p>
      <p>Orlondo Steinauer of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats received the award after guiding his team to a 15-3 record and a berth in Sunday’s Grey Cup game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>“Craig Dickenson, you could be up here very easily,” Steinauer, who received 38 first-place votes, said after receiving his award. “Congratulations to you.”</p>
      <p>Dickenson extended congratulations in return.</p>
      <p>“Coach O is very well-deserving of the award,” Dickenson told CKRM’s Derek Taylor. “I was disappointed our guys didn’t get them, but it doesn’t mean they were any less successful or had any less of a great season.</p>
      <p>“I think we had a great season all around and I was proud of the guys, regardless of whether any awards came up.”</p>
      <p>Ex-Roughrider Willie Jefferson, now of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, was named the most outstanding defensive player. He received 39 first-place votes. Hamilton’s Simoni Lawrence was the runner-up.</p>
      <p>Also honoured were Hamilton teammates Chris Van Zeyl (most outstanding offensive lineman) and Frankie Williams (top special-teams player), along with Calgary Stampeders linebacker Nate Holley (rookie of the year).</p>
      <p>Jim Lawson, chairman of the CFL’s board of governors, received the Commissioner’s Award.</p>
      <p>Stampeders general manager and president John Hufnagel received the Hugh Campbell Distinguished Leadership Award.</p>
      <p>The Tom Pate Memorial Award was presented to Stampeders punter Rob Maver, in recognition of his sportsmanship and contributions to the team and his community.</p>
      <p>Montreal long-snapper Martin Bedard received the Jake Gaudaur Veterans’ Award.</p>
      <p>The Stampeders’ director of video operations, Ross Folan, was the inaugural winner of the Jane Mawby Tribute Award, which honours an often-unsung employee at the club or league level.</p>
