      <p>The synopsis of the next episode of <b>Batwoman</b> reads:</p>
      <p>Kate (Ruby Rose) and Alice (Rachel Skarsten) continue their sister/nemesis dance, while Alice and Mouse (guest star Sam Littlefield) construct their most evil plan yet. Mary (Nicole Kang) invites Kate to a special event honoring Catherine (Elizabeth Anweis) and Jacob (Dougray Scott) makes a decision that leaves Kate perplexed. Meagan Tandy and Camrus Johnson also star.</p>
      <p>Holly Dale directed the episode written by Nancy Kiu.</p>
      <p>After a dishonorable discharge from military school and years of brutal survival training, Kate returns home when the Alice in Wonderland gang targets her father and his security firm, by kidnapping his best Crow officer Sophie Moore (Meagan Tandy). Although remarried to wealthy socialite Catherine Hamilton-Kane (Elizabeth Anweis), who bankrolls the Crows, Jacob still struggles with the family he lost, while keeping Kate — the daughter he still has — at a distance.</p>
      <p>Based on the characters from DC, <b>Batwoman</b> comes from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television with executive producers Greg Berlanti, Caroline Dries, as well as Geoff Johns, and Sarah Schechter. Additionally, David Nutter and Marcos Siega executive produced the pilot.</p>
      <p>The next episode of <b>Batwoman </b>airs December 1 on The CW. What do you think about the first season of <b>Batwoman </b>so far? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
