      <p>A US appeals court has upheld two rulings that Apple infringed VirnetX patents, but reversed the decision on two others. The nearly decade-long legal case must now go back a Texas judge who will consider further hearings.</p>

      <p>A Texas jury's previous decision that <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple">Apple</a> must pay <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/VirnetX">VirnetX</a> Holdings Corp $503 million for <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/patent">patent</a> infringement has been overturned. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit agreed that Apple had infringed two VirnetX patents regarding secure telecommunications technology, including FaceTime, used in the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPhone">iPhone</a>, but upheld two others.<br/><br/>According to <i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-virnetx-verdict/virnetx-patent-win-against-apple-vacated-by-u-s-appeals-court-idUSKBN1XW1TS">Reuters</a></i>, the decision means that the court is now returning the case to a Texas judge for further proceedings.<br/><br/>That judge may decide to recalculate the sum Apple is to pay VirnetX. However he or she may also conduct a new trial, limited specifically to determining damages.<br/><br/>This would mean that the case, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/376050142/VirnetX-Patent-Suit-2012">first filed</a> in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, in 2010, would be heading back to court. <br/><br/>Last month, a Federal Court panel suggested that the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/07/federal-court-uncertain-it-can-uphold-600m-virnetx-ruling-against-apple">damages awarded could be affected</a> by patent claims still being determined. <br/><br/>This is not the first time that Apple has had a sum of damages vacated. The first lawsuit in 2010 saw the company ordered to pay $368 million for infringing one patent, only for that to be reversed two years later.<br/><br/>A 2016 retrial saw the damages rise to $625 million, but that trial was claimed to be unfair because of jury confusion. Two more retrials followed before an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/04/10/apple-ordered-to-pay-virnetx-5026m-in-patent-infringement-row">April 2018 ruling</a> appeared to conclude the case.</p>
