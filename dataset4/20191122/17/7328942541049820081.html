      <p>Well, I'm sure you remember the time <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/elon-musk-tried-to-send-a-tweet-via-starlink-satellite-and-whoa-it-worked">Elon</a> Musk smoked a blunt on Joe Rogan's podcast and it went completely viral. </p>

      <p>After this, it caused a kind of trouble for him and his companies, SpaceX and Tesla. So, he <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-apologized-spacex-smoking-weed">apologized</a> in a mass email to SpaceX employees, saying "SpaceX maintains a drug-free workplace."</p>

      <p>Turns out, it really isn't. The Tesla <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/tesla-gigafactory-in-trouble-over-sudden-monopoly-of-battery-supply">Gigafactory</a> in Nevada was <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/police-reports-tesla-drugs-meth-cocaine-heroin">found</a> out to be not drug-free at all. </p>

      <p>According to the reports obtained from police in Storey County, Nevada, the work-space of Gigafactory is actually full of drugs such as meth, heroin, and cocaine left open by workers.</p>

      <p>Police found a white rock substance in a clear plastic container on the warehouse floor and tested the substance only to find out that it was cocaine. </p>

      <p>Another thing police found was a small brown square in a greenish cellophane bag. It was titled "Possible Heroin," by one report. </p>

      <p>Also, drugs aren't the only thing that Tesla is accused of having. A report says that a Tesla commercial truck hit a horse and injured the animal so badly that an officer had to kill it with a shotgun. </p>
      <p>Well, Tesla and SpaceX have crazily advanced technologies that may lead us to think they can't be done with a sober mind. But is it ethical or safe, that's the most significant point. </p>
