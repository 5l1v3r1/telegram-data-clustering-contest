      <h1>Black Friday Brings the Cost of BT's Fibre Internet Down to a New Low</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>The internet providers certainly love to try and flog their services, because why wouldn't they? Now BT is up to those tricks as well, <a href="https://www.bt.com/broadband/deals/blackfridayoffers?s_cid=con_FURL_blackfriday">announcing new savings on fibre internet packages, BT Sport, and phone deals. </a>Because for some reason BT sells mobile contracts itself, despite owning EE.</p>
      <p>BT's Superfast Fibre Essential package can be purchased for just £25 a month, saving people a total of £120 over the course of 24 months. You can also get the Superfast Fibre Essential package (which comes with the 'Complete Wi-Fi' package) for £35 instead of the usual £40.</p>
      <p>On top of this BT TV customers will be able to add BT Sport to their package for an extra £5 a month. If you're with Sky TV you can also get a discount, but it'll cost you £10 a month instead - provided you have BT broadband. If you're on Sky or TalkTalk it'll cost you £20.</p>
      <p>Finally are the mobile deals, which can get you 20GB of data for £15 a month, 40GB of data for £25 a month, all with unlimited minutes and texts.  The unlimited data plan is £30 a month, though BT customers are eligible for an extra £5 discount on all deals.</p>
      <p>Phone wise you can get the iPhone 8 on a 12GB data plan for £29 a month (saving £144), or an iPhone 7 with prices starting at £21 a month. iPhone 8 buyers can also upgrade to 45GB of data for an extra £2 a month, and iPhone 7 owners can get 12 times the amount of data for an extra £35 a month.</p>
      <p>If you're not into Apple the Sony Xperia L1 starts at £10 a month (1GB of data), he Huawei P Smart 2019 starts at £12 a month, and the O30 Lite starts at £17 a month. Meanwhile the Samsung Galaxy A40 costs £15 a month with 3GB of data, with the option to get 12GB for £17. The Galaxy A70 starts at £19, with an extra £3 a month for 12GB of data.</p>
      <p>That's barely scratching the surface, though, and you can check out the rest of <a href="https://www.bt.com/broadband/deals/blackfridayoffers?s_cid=con_FURL_blackfriday">BT's deals over on its website.</a></p>
