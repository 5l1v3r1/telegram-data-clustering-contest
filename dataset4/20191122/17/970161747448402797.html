      <p>The controversial right-wing shock jock Alex Jones has ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jByhRA4Nydg">stormed</a>’ an Apple factory in the ‘InfoWars Battle Tank’.</p>
      <p>Jones, who is banned from Facebook, Twitter and Youtube, rocked up outside a facility in Texas which builds Mac Pro computers.</p>
      <p>The factory employs thousands of people and is part of Apple’s $1 billion plan to make more of its products in the USA.</p>
      <p>‘When you build it in the United States, you don’t have to worry about tariffs,’ Trump said after touring the building.</p>
      <p>Outside, Alex Jones squared off against anti-Trump protesters.</p>

      <p>Driving an armoured car and yelling through a bullhorn, Alex Jones slammed left-wingers and called for free speech to be protected.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to hear exactly what he shouted, but it sounded something like: ‘We have come here in an armoured vehicle to protect us from the left.</p>
      <p>‘They are the same as the communist Chinese who ran over people in tanks to suppress their speech.</p>
      <p>‘We are here to promote free speech.’</p>
      <p>He also yelled: ‘America is back. Donald Trump is fighting corruption. Donald Trump is innocent and America loves Trump.;</p>
