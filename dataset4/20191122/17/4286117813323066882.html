      <h1>Jharkhand Assembly: Myth of Speaker's jinx</h1>
      <h2>Since Jharkhand assembly's inception 19 years ago, no sitting assembly speaker has ever won the next election.</h2>

      <p>Jharkhand assembly turned 19 on Friday. After its inception on this day in the year 2000, it has witnessed a lot of ups and downs - more than 10 changes of guards. But there has been one constant - the speaker who chaired the assembly lost subsequent elections. This has happened in 2005, 2009 and 2014. The sitting assembly speaker has never won the next election.</p>
      <p>In 2005 when Jharkhand went to elections, MP Singh was on the chair. He was denied ticket from Jamshedpur West to accommodate Saryu Rai. Irked Speaker contested on an RJD ticket and lost the battle.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Alam Gir Alam who contested in 2009 as a sitting speaker lost the election from Pakur as Congress, RJD and JMM contested the elections on their own without an alliance. JMM emerged victorious from Pakur. Again in 2014, JMM, Congress and RJD could not come to terms and went alone in electoral fray and the then Speaker Shashank Shekhar Bhokta lost the contest from Sarath Constituency in Deoghar.</p>
      <p>Political expert Baidyanath Mishra, aware of the nitty-gritty and nuances of Jharkhand, says it's a coincidence that no sitting speaker has been able to break the jinx but there is always a valid logic behind why they lost.</p>
      <p>CP Singh, the urban development minister in Raghuwar cabinet, had chaired the assembly from 2009 to till Hemant Soren took over in 2013. He is confident that the jinx of the speaker will definitely break with the win of Dinesh Oran, the current speaker who is contesting from Sisai constituency.</p>
