      <h1>Coldplay will no longer tour until shows are environmentally sustainable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:34:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Coldplay will not go on a world tour to promote its latest album, citing <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientists-officially-declare-climate-emergency-untold-suffering-study-today-2019-11-05/">environmental concerns</a>. The British band said it won't tour again until the shows can be done in a sustainable way. </p>
      <p>"We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral," frontman <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">Chris Martin told BBC News</a> Thursday. He said the band wants to figure out how a tour can be not only sustainable, but actually beneficial to the environment. </p>

      <p>Traditionally, concerts have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carbon-dioxide-emissions-will-rise-until-2040-even-if-world-meets-its-reduction-promises-international-energy-agency/">large carbon footprints</a> and produce a massive amount of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-plastic-pavement-curb-the-worlds-epidemic-of-plastic-waste/">plastic waste</a>. The travel of both fans and performers, lighting and merchandise all have negative environmental impacts. </p>
      <p>The band's latest album, "Everyday Life" was released globally Friday. Instead of a world tour, the band played two shows in Amman, Jordan, on Friday, which can be <a href="https://twitter.com/coldplay/status/1197883372904820738">viewed globally for free</a> on YouTube. </p>
      <p>Coldplay will also play one show on Monday at London's Natural History Museum. All proceeds from that performance will be donated to an environmental charity, BBC reports.</p>
      <p>"Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally," Martin said, referring to the band's last world tour in 2016 and 2017, which featured over 100 shows across five continents.</p>
      <p>"The hardest thing is the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flight-shame-could-hurt-airlines-as-travelers-shun-air-travel/">flying side of things</a>," he said. "But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/european-union-ban-on-single-use-plastics-comes-closer/">single-use plastic</a>, to have it largely solar-powered." </p>

      <p>Martin said the band will spend the next couple of years figuring out how to develop a tour that actively benefits the environment.</p>
      <p>"We've done a lot of big tours at this point," he continued. "How do we turn it around so it's not so much taking as giving?"</p>
