      <h1>Liverpool lift temporary ban of fan responsible for offensive Divock Origi banner</h1>
      <h2>The supporter is now free from suspension after agreeing to undergo an education course</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:17:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/dan-kay/" target="_blank">Dan Kay</a></address>
      <p>A Liverpool fan whose offensive banner of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/divock-origi">Divock Origi</a> prompted a police and club investigation has had his temporary ban lifted.</p>
      <p>The PA news agency understands the supporter is now free from suspension from all matches involving the Reds after agreeing to undergo an education course with football's equality and inclusion organisation Kick It Out.</p>
      <p>He will also attend a session within the club's community programme as part of the resolution.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> had condemned the Photoshopped banner of the striker for "perpetuating a racial stereotype" when they became aware of its presence prior to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league">Champions League</a> match at Genk last month.</p>
      <p>However, the incident was not logged with UEFA's match delegate and therefore cannot be subject to disciplinary proceedings by European football's governing body.</p>
      <p>Liverpool released this statement on the night the banner was seen: "Liverpool Football Club condemns the offensive banner displayed in our section of the ground, prior to kick-off.</p>
      <p>"To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.</p>
      <p>"Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process."</p>
      <p>Supporters' group Spirit of Shankly welcomed the swift action taken by the club, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-fan-behind-offensive-origi-17142226">and said last week:</a> "Spirit of Shankly oppose all forms of racism. The club took swift action in the removal of the offensive banner that perpetuates racial stereotyping.</p>
      <p>"Football isn't separate from society, it is part of it and we all have a responsibility in ensuring people understand there is no room for racism.</p>
      <p>"Simply banning people is not the answer. Education and reaffirming there is no place for discrimination in society has to form part of the solution."</p>
