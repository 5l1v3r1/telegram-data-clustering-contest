      <h1>GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn tweets conspiratorial smear against Lt. Col Vindman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:54:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Krawczyk</a></address>
      <p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) has it out for a Purple Heart veteran.</p>
      <p>When Lt. Col Alexander Vindman testified in the impeachment hearing into President Trump on Tuesday, Trump and other Republicans <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879460/trump-questions-why-lt-col-vindman-wearing-army-uniform-testify-even-though-hes-required">questioned his military bonafides</a> and seemed skeptical of the fact that he doesn't know who the Ukraine whistleblower is. And in a Friday tweet, Blackburn kept the attacks going, tweeting that "Vindictive Vindman is the 'whistleblower’s' handler."</p>

      <p>There's a lot wrong with this short tweet. First, it suggests Vindman has something against Trump, furthering the <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/874943/fox-news-already-attacking-lt-col-alexander-vindman-next-house-impeachment-witness-msnbc-notes">right-wing rhetoric</a> that claims he's less American because he was born in the Soviet Union. And second, it falsely claims Vindman knows the identity of the whistleblower — something that isn't true, but didn't stop Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) from trying to get Vindman to <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879406/devin-nunes-tries-fails-lt-col-vindman-whistleblower">spill their identity</a> on Tuesday. And third, it's an outright smear on a high-ranking military official who received heaps of praise for his service before, during, and after his hearing.</p>
