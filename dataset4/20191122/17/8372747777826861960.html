      <p>"It’s an 800-number; the phones are staffed by experts."</p>
      <p>Fans of The West Wing are quite familiar with the famous scene when President Bartlet was surprised that there is an 800-hotline to ask questions about how to prepare a turkey. Decades later, the Turkey Talk Line has evolved into more than a hotline.</p>
      <p>The hotline still exists, but there are other ways to get your critical turkey questions answered by experts.</p>
      <p>Here are the ways to get help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Butterball Skill for Amazon Alexa:</b> Users can simply say, “Alexa, ask Butterball…” to enable the skill. Once enabled, just ask the Butterball skill your cooking questions and hear trusted Talk-Line experts share answers. Users can even watch how-to videos on compatible Alexa-enabled devices (Echo Show, Echo Spot and Amazon Fire TV).</li>
        <li><b>Text (844-877-3456)</b>: With nearly one in three first-time cooks saying they’d text the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line for cooking help, it only makes sense that, for the fourth year in a row, the Turkey Talk-Line offers text support in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving.</li>

      <p>“Over the past 40 years, the Turkey Talk-Line has witnessed first-hand the evolution of Thanksgiving celebrations among the people we help every year,” Butterball Turkey Talk-Line Director Nicole Johnson said. “From hosting your first Friendsgiving to testing different cooking methods – like air-frying – we are here to help answer all those turkey questions so you can celebrate the big day—when, where and however you decide.”</p>
      <p>According to Butterball, 50 million people have used the Turkey Talk Line. Butterball employs a staff of 50, some of whom are able to offer advice in Spanish.</p>
