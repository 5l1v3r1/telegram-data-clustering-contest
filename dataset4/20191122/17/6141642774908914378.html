      <p>British-born US security adviser Fiona Hill has been praised in her home town as a great example of a strong northern woman.</p>
      <p>The Russian analyst for the Trump administration wowed observers, particularly his political opponents, while she gave evidence at his impeachment hearing in Washington on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The daughter of a coalminer, she was born in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, where her widowed mother, a retired midwife, still lives.</p>
      <p>Commentators on Twitter have called her a “bad ass”, wished she could be president, demanded a TV mini-series be made of her life, and hailed her straight-talking style.</p>
      <p>The Mayor of Bishop Auckland, Councillor Joy Allen, said: “I cannot imagine what it must have been like for her, to go out and give evidence when the world was watching.</p>
      <blockquote>She (Fiona Hill) is a shining light<cite>Joy Allen, Mayor of Bishop Auckland</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“She must have nerves of steel.</p>
      <p>“She came across so well, so honest and so trustworthy.</p>
      <p>“It is great for the North East, great for northern women, and she is a really great role model.</p>
      <p>“I am really proud of her coming from Bishop Auckland and doing so well.</p>
      <p>“She is a shining light.”</p>
      <p>During her evidence, Dr Hill explained how she became a US citizen by choice, saying: “This country has offered for me opportunities I never would have had in England.</p>
      <p>“I grew up poor, with a very distinctive working-class accent.</p>
      <p>“In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement.</p>

      <p>She also confirmed a story about a boy setting fire to her pigtails when she was 11, while she as taking a school test, and she calmly put the flames out and carried on with the exam.</p>
      <p>In 2016 she told The Guardian newspaper about trying to win a place at Oxford University in the 1980s and compared it to a scene from the film Billy Elliot, which features a schoolboy from County Durham attending the Royal Ballet School.</p>
      <p>She said: “People were making fun of me for my accent and the way I was dressed.</p>
      <p>“It was the most embarrassing, awful experience I had ever had in my life.”</p>

      <p>History writer Dan Jackson, author of the best-selling book The Northumbrians: North-East England And Its People, questioned whether a Geordie accent was still a block to success in the way Dr Hill surmised.</p>
      <p>He said: “If you look at Ant and Dec, it’s not held them back, they have been voted Britain’s most popular entertainers 18 years running.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure part of their appeal is that people like their accents.”</p>
      <p>The writer also addressed the vexatious question of whether, as someone from County Durham, she was correctly labelled as having a Geordie accent, because some believe the term only refers to people born in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Until recently, he said, people from Sunderland were also called Geordies, not just those from Newcastle – and the author said those from Northumberland or County Durham could make a claim to that name if they wanted.</p>
      <p>He said: “There’s no consensus on it, no arbitrating authority.</p>
      <p>“It’s a matter of self-identity.”</p>
