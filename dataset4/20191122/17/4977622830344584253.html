      <p>Karnataka Police on Friday (22 November) carted away a contingent of 59 Bangladeshi illegal migrants by train to Kolkata as part of the state's deportation exercise, an official said here.</p>
      <p>"They (illegal migrants) have been taken by a train, they are travelling towards Howrah. They have already boarded the train along with 30 Karnataka policemen," Bengaluru East Deputy Commissioner of Police S D Sharanappa told IANS.</p>
      <p>Including women police officers, the 30-member Karnataka police team is escorting 18 men, 23 women and 18 children for handing over to the West Bengal Police and the Border Security Force (BSF).</p>
      <p>"We spoke to the concerned agencies of West Bengal Police and also the BSF, we are coordinating with the Karnataka Home Department and the Union Home Ministry," said Sharanappa.</p>
      <p>According to him, there are no cases against the illegal migrants as they are victims of human trafficking.</p>
      <p>The train carrying the illegal migrant contingent is scheduled to reach Kolkata around 3 PM on Saturday (23 November), after which they will be handed over to the West Bengal Police and BSF, he added.</p>
      <p>Police had to move the Bangladeshis to the Puttaparthi railway station of Ananthapur district in Andhra Pradesh to board the train, as the South Western Railway zone could not provide a full coach to accommodate the police right from Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>A standard second class sleeper compartment has 72 berths.</p>
