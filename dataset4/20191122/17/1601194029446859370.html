      <p>The penultimate league match of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/t10-cricket-league">T10 League 2019</a> witnessed a clash between the tournament's two most successful teams, Bangla Tigers and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/maratha-arabians">Maratha Arabians</a>. The Arabians sealed their place at the top of the points table with a resounding 7-wicket win over their opponents.</p>
      <p>The Tigers had won the toss and elected to bat first on a flat track at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. Thisara Perera's men got off to a disastrous start as they lost their top three batsmen inside the first 13 balls of the innings. The Sri Lankan duo of Kasun Rajitha (2/18) and Lasith Malinga (1/25) grabbed the three wickets.</p>
      <p>Wicket-keeper batsman Tom Moores (43*) held one end however, he received no support from the other batsmen. Ultimately, Robbie Frylinck's (18) cameo helped the Tigers post 106 runs on the board. Dwayne Bravo (2/24) starred for the Maratha side with his variations.</p>

      <p>Chasing 107 off 60 balls, Maratha Arabians got off to a flier as Chris Lynn (23) and Adam Lyth (14) added 30 runs for the first wicket. The Bangla Tigers reduced them to 48/3 in 4.3 overs but, the Indian big-hitter Yuvraj Singh (23*) and Najibullah Zadran (36*) took the Arabians home with their aggressive batting. Both the batsmen struck two sixes each in their 61-run partnership for the fourth wicket.</p>
      <p>Liam Plunkett (1/15) tried his best to save the day for the Tigers but now they will have to win the Eliminator tomorrow to stay alive in the competition.</p>

      <p>Najibullah won the Player of the Match award for his whirlwind knock while this win has cemented Maratha Arabians' top spot in the standings. They will meet the Qalandars tomorrow in their Qualifier and the Eliminator match of T10 League 2019 will feature the Deccan Gladiators and Bangla Tigers.</p>
