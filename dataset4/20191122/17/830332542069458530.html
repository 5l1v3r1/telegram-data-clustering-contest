      <h3>A Storm will lash the East this weekend</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/weather/2019/11/22/daily-weather-forecast-thanksgiving-travel-weekend-rain-flood.cnn.html">A storm affecting the Southeast on Friday will ride up the eastern seaboard through the weekend</a> affecting travel through Sunday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Friday, showers and storms stretch through East Texas, Louisiana and much of the Southeast. There could be airport delays in Houston, Memphis and Jackson, with 1 to 2 inches of rain possible.</li>
        <li>Saturday, rain continues to push east, bringing rain and snow to the Ohio Valley and heavy rain to the Southeast. By the afternoon, rain starts moving into the mid-Atlantic. There could be airport delays in New Orleans, Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, DC and Philadelphia. Rain of 1 to 2 inches is possible.</li>
        <li>Sunday, rain continues for the Northeast with snow for portions of the Ohio Valley and west of I-95. Airport delays will include DC, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Rain of 1 to 2 inches is possible with gusty winds.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Another storm will batter the Midwest Tuesday into Wednesday</h3>
      <p>Low pressure pushes east of the Rockies during the day on Tuesday, bringing a quick round of snow to the Plains before quickly strengthening and taking aim at the Midwest.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicago will start with rain Tuesday afternoon, then turn to snow late Tuesday. The snow should be out of Chicago by Wednesday morning.</li>
        <li>Parts of Wisconsin and Michigan will get a round of heavy snow on Tuesday and early Wednesday before clearing out.</li>
        <li>Behind the system, temperatures will drop 5 to 15 degrees. Much of the Midwest will have highs in the upper 30s to low 40s for Thanksgiving Day, with dry conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The next system moves through the West Wednesday</h3>
      <p>An area of low pressure will pump moisture into California late Wednesday and throughout the day Thursday, leaving Thanksgiving Day gray and dreary.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A quick shot of rain for Northern California and the Bay Area is expected late Tuesday into Wednesday morning.</li>
        <li>The heaviest rain will be in Southern California and Western Arizona -- including Los Angeles and San Diego throughout the day Wednesday and Thursday.</li>
        <li>A quick round of snow will blanket the Sierras on Thursday.</li>
        <li>Much of the rain and snow will be moving out of the Southwest by Saturday morning.</li>
        <li>Snow is also forecast for the Rockies through Saturday.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What about the Northeast and Macy's Parade?</h3>
      <p>There will be a quick round of rain for the Northeast on Wednesday, but it should be cleared out by Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will drop about 10 to 15 degrees behind the front, so Thanksgiving will be cooler but closer to average.</p>
      <p>So far, the forecast looks dry for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The start of the parade should be under partly cloudy skies with temperatures in the low 40s and a Northwest wind 10-15 mph. Highs are expected in the mid-40s.</p>
      <h3>Busiest travel season</h3>
      <p>AAA is expecting this year to have<a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2019/11/aaa-more-than-55-million-travelers-taking-to-the-roads-and-skies-this-thanksgiving/"> the second-highest number of travelers in at least a decade</a>. The organization is predicting an increase of 1.6 million travelers compared to last year, with most people driving to their destination thanks to lower gas prices.</p>
      <p>Wednesday is expected to have the most traffic congestion. Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Houston and San Francisco could see more than three times their norms.</p>
