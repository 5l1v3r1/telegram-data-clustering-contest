      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/mwc-2019/">MWC 2019</a> saw Huawei take the wraps off its own take on the foldable smartphone, the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/337552-forget-the-galaxy-fold-huaweis-5g-foldable-smartphone-has-the-x-factor/">Mate X</a>. Sporting a price that makes the wallet whimper in fear, it goes beyond saying that repairing the foldable smartphone is not going to be cheap. But, how much would it cost to replace the display on the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345327-china-is-getting-the-foldable-huawei-mate-x-smartphone-this-month/">Mate X</a>, I hear you ask?</p>
      <p>In a world where flagship smartphone prices have breached the $1000 threshold (hello <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342838-samsung-waters-down-the-note-line-with-the-note-10-launch/">Galaxy Note 10+</a>), how much would you deem acceptable to pay for a new display for your handset? $100? Perhaps even $200-350? Well, how about paying the same amount as you might for a Galaxy Note 10+? Yup, that’s right, replacing the Mate X display will cost you a cool $1000. A thousand dollars. For the moment, the Mate X is only on <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345608-huaweis-mate-x-the-backwards-foldable-phone-ships-in-november-for-2400/">sale in China</a>, sans Google apps and services, so it’s unlikely that you’ll need this service anytime soon.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Gizchina</i>, Huawei’s service centers in China will charge 7,080 yuan ($1,000) for screen replacement/repair, which is just a little short of half the phone’s asking price of 16,888 yuan ($2,403) while a new motherboard will set you back around $510. Other repairs are much more reasonable, with a new battery costing around $40, a replacement rear camera $99, and a new battery cover priced at $51.</p>
      <p>Getting back on topic, $1000 for a replacement display for the Mate X folding smartphone that wears its display on the outside is more than a little worrying. Imagine spending $2,400 on a phone and being terrified of using it because you knew you couldn’t afford to fix it?</p>
      <p>Anyhow, would you still buy the Mate X (if it was on sale outside of China) despite the likely repair cost if you broke the display?</p>
