      <p>Lorenzo-Vera, who shook off the effects of a lung infection to open up a one-shot advantage on Thursday, dropped two shots in the final four holes of the second round but still managed to set a clubhouse target at 12-under at Jumeirah Golf Estates.</p>
      <p>England’s Fleetwood, who won the Nedbank Golf Challenge last weekend to step up his pursuit of the season-ending European number one crown, sank seven birdies in a round of 68 to claim a share of the second spot.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a classic case of trying to stay in the moment and take each shot as it comes,” said Fleetwood, bidding for his second Race to Dubai title in three years.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot going on over the weekend, there’s a lot of different scenarios and players in the mix.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of things going on around you so the more internally focused you can be and the more you can just stay in your bubble, it will just be a great challenge going into the weekend trying to do that.”</p>
      <p>Rahm is also one of the five players who can finish at the top of the European Tour’s money list on Sunday and the Spaniard signed for a 69 to sit alongside Fleetwood on the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger, the current leader of the Race to Dubai standings, was tied for 13th and nine shots off the lead.</p>
      <h3>‘FICKLE GAME’</h3>
      <p>World number two Rory McIlroy failed to build on a stellar opening round display as he dropped to a share of fifth at six-under after making just two birdies in the second round.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman started with a double bogey at the par-three sixth and, after carding a brilliant eagle on the 18th on Thursday, hit the tee shot into the water on Friday to settle for a par on the last.</p>
      <p>“I just wasn’t quite there,” said McIlroy, who is making his final appearance of the year before taking a two-month break.</p>
      <p>“The wind was tricky and the course played a little trickier, but obviously I just didn’t quite play as well as yesterday. It’s a very fickle game.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always said that one day it can seem very easy and someone up there says ‘no, not so fast’, and brings you back down to earth. That’s golf!”</p>
      <p>McIlroy, a three-times Race to Dubai champion, finished with a 74, 10 shots worse than his opener.</p>
