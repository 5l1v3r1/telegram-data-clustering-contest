      <h1>Get the $330 Ring Video Doorbell Pro + Echo Show 5 bundle for $189 today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:26:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Some Black Friday 2019 bundles are a little weird, with retailers trying to lump things together that really have no place being sold as a bundle. It’s almost like they’re just trying to unload inventory that they couldn’t get rid of earlier in the year. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Doorbell-existing-doorbell-required/dp/B07RS88HZC?tag=b0c55-20">Ring Video Doorbell Pro and Echo Show 5</a>, on the other hand, are the perfect bundle for two reasons. First, you can see who’s at your door on the Echo Show 5’s display. And second, you can use Alexa commands and say things like “Alexa, show me who’s at the front door.” It’s an awesome bundle and it sells for $330 on a normal day. Today is the first day of Amazon’s big Black Friday 2019 blowout, however, so the bundle is down to an all-time low of just $189!</p>
