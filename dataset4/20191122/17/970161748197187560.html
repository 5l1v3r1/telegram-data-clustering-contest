      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> goalkeeper Ederson is set to be fit for his side’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clash against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> at the Etihad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian missed City’s 3-1 defeat to Liverpool a fortnight ago after his removal in the draw against Atalanta with a hamstring strain.</p>
      <p>Claudio Bravo deputised for Ederson at Anfield and was arguably culpable for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a>’s crucial third goal when he stayed rooted to his line for Jordan Henderson’s cross.</p>
      <p>However, Guardiola confirmed today that his number one is now fit again and is set to return against Chelsea.</p>

      <p>‘Ederson is back,’ said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>‘He trained in the last few days without pain.’</p>

      <p>However, the news on Aymeric Laporte and Leroy Sane was less positive.</p>
      <p>The pair are both out with long-term knee injuries and recent reports had suggested the Frenchman in particular was ahead of schedule in his return.</p>
      <p>But Guardiola says both players could still be out for another three months.</p>
      <p>‘Laporte and Sane are still injured for two or three months.’</p>
