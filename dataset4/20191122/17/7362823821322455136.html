      <p>Media mogul <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/us-firm-liberty-media-buying-formula-one-auto-racing-series">John Malone</a> indicated on Thursday that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> wasn't the right person to lead the country, arguing that his administration had produced "chaos."</p>
      <p>“Half the people that he’s hired and thrown under the bus are now trying to kill him. I mean, what kind of thing is that? It’s chaos," he told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/media-mogul-john-malone-says-trump-causes-chaos-likes-bloomberg.html">CNBC.</a></p>
      <p>“I just don’t think he’s the right guy to do it. He just doesn’t build a team, I think that’s the No. 1 problem."</p>
      <p>Malone is the chairman of Liberty Media, which owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team and has a <a href="http://www.libertymedia.com/companies/liberty-siriusxm-group.html">71 percent ownership</a> of Sirius XM satellite radio.</p>

      <p>His comments came as House Democrats pressed on with an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> against the president and Trump's administration saw a succession of high-profile departures like former National Security Adviser (NSA) John Bolton. Bolton was Trump's third NSA since he took office in 2017.</p>
      <p>Malone said that he would support former New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> if he ran for president in 2020, although he wasn't sure if the billionaire had "much of a chance."</p>

      <p>While Bloomberg hasn't officially announced his run, he's filed to place his name on multiple state primary ballots, including Texas and Michigan.</p>
      <p>During his Thursday interview, Malone added that Trump has done a lot of "great" things but "I just don’t think he’s the right guy to do it."</p>
