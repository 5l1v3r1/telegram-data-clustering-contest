      <p><b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a></b> called into “Fox &amp; Friends” this morning for a nearly hourlong interview. </p>

        <b>TRUMP REPEATED HIS DEBUNKED CLAIM THAT UKRAINE IS CONNECTED TO A HACKED 2016 DEMOCRATIC SERVER:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Trump said on “Fox &amp; Friends”:</b> "They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it’s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian, and I still want to see that server. ... A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?"</p>
      <p><b>Co-host Steve Doocey asked:</b> "Are you sure they did that?" </p>
      <p><b>Trump</b>: "That’s what the word is. That’s what I asked actually on my phone call you know. I asked it very point-blank because we’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption. Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries when there’s this kind of corruption?"</p>
      <p><b>Keep in mind</b>: “Trump made the claim a day after a former White House official with expertise on Russia, <b>Fiona Hill</b>, chastised Republicans for giving air in the impeachment hearings to conspiracy theories that Ukraine, and not Russia, was a driver of electoral interference in the 2016 election.” <a href="http://bit.ly/2rkjI0Y">http://bit.ly/2rkjI0Y</a></p>

      <p>"Kellyanne is great but she’s married to a total whack job,” Trump said on the show. “I think, she must have done some number on him ... I don’t know what Kellyanne did to that guy because I don’t even know him ... he’s got to be some kind of a nut job. She must have done some bad things to him because that guy’s crazy." <a href="http://bit.ly/2KLFh11">http://bit.ly/2KLFh11</a></p>

        <u>IN THE WHITE HOUSE</u>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>It’s me, Prince Charming:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Via The Hill’s <b>Alexander Bolton</b>, “<b>President Trump</b> stepped up his charm offensive with Senate Republicans, who will handle any House impeachment charges, by meeting Thursday with a group of GOP lawmakers that included two of his biggest critics: Sens. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/willard-mitt-romney">Mitt Romney</a></b> (Utah) and <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/susan-collins">Susan Collins</a></b> (Maine).” <a href="http://bit.ly/2D3ZLOx">http://bit.ly/2D3ZLOx</a></p>
      <p><b>What they discussed, besides impeachment of course</b>: “Legislation to lower prescription drug costs, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal and proposals to curb vaping products.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>REACTIONS FROM REPUBLICANS INVOLVED:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine):</b> Collins said “the vast majority of the discussion was on prescription drugs and vaping.” And she said Trump’s comments on impeachment were “brief.”</p>
      <p><b>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/shelley-moore-capito">Shelley Moore Capito</a> (R-W.Va.):</b> “It was good.” She also said she got to pitch the president on her bill to protect minors from sale for financial gain. </p>
      <p><b>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-cornyn">John Cornyn</a> (R-Texas):</b> “We work together necessarily to pass legislation, so I don’t think getting together and having conversations about issues is anything wrong. I think senators will do their duty as they see it, regardless of a free lunch.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>TIDBIT FROM <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-bolton">John Bolton</a> THIS MORNING:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former national security adviser John Bolton tweeted this morning, “Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned........” <a href="http://bit.ly/2reOl7O">http://bit.ly/2reOl7O</a></p>
      <p><b>He then followed up two hours later</b>: “We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come.....” <a href="http://bit.ly/2XAsFza">http://bit.ly/2XAsFza</a></p>

        <u>LATEST WITH THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY</u>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Interesting poll — independents aren’t keen on impeachment:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>For context</b>: That’s a 6-point swing since October, when 48 percent supported impeachment and 44 percent opposed it.</p>
      <p><b>I.e.: </b>More independents now oppose impeachment than support it. </p>
