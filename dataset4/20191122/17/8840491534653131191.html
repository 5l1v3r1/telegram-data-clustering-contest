      <p>Mayo University Hospital is extending its visiting restrictions across the hospital due to increasing numbers of patients displaying symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting usually caused by Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by the hospital said: “We are aware that there are people in the community with the virus and visiting will increase the risk of our patients getting the virus.</p>
      <p>“When the virus becomes active in a ward it is very difficult to control it due to high numbers of patients.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with recent symptoms of diarrhoea and/or vomiting or who has had contact with others who have these symptoms must not visit patients in the hospital.</p>
      <p>“In order to protect vulnerable patients please ensure that you use alcohol gel on your hands before visiting and when leaving your relative. In these circumstances, visitors are advised to limit their movement throughout the hospital.</p>
      <p>“Children should not visit the hospital during this time as they may be particularly susceptible to the illness or carrying the virus.</p>
      <p>“The hospital management has put control measures in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading to other areas/departments within the hospital. It is important that ill and vulnerable patients are not impacted by this.</p>
      <p>“The situation is being monitored closely and the visiting restrictions will be lifted as soon as possible. The hospital would like to thank members of the public for their co-operation.”</p>
