      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a> has been very outspoken about wanting to face <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> since the former WWE Champion made his debut on FS1 show WWE Backstage last week.</p>
      <p>In response, Punk said he did not join the show to “shoot your little angles” and gave his opinion that the four-time World Champion is making himself look like a “fool” by tweeting about him all the time.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mandatory.com/wrestlezone/news/1154317-seth-rollins-calls-out-cm-punk-wrestlemania">Wrestlezone’s Kevin Kellam</a> on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wrestlezoneradio">101WKQX Chicago</a>, Rollins continued the war of words by saying Punk “couldn’t bust a cherry in a fruit fight”, while he also suggested that the former MMA fighter was “a little keyboard warrior-ish” with his comments on WWE Backstage.</p>
      <blockquote>“I want to make some money, so if CM Punk wants to talk all of the smack in the world, I’ve invited him a million times to come to my ring, to my domain on live television where you can’t hide behind anything, no desk in LA. Let’s do this thing, man. Let’s fight. Let’s fight it out like men.”</blockquote>
      <p>Although Punk has repeatedly said he is not actively pursuing an in-ring return, Rollins explained that he has recently targeted “The Best In The World” because he wants to go one-on-one against him in the main event of WrestleMania.</p>
      <blockquote>“For me, the only place the match happens is WrestleMania in the main event. That’s the only reason I’m picking a fight with him, I’ve got no other interest than that. If he’s interested, it’s out there. Any time you’re ready, let’s go.”</blockquote>
