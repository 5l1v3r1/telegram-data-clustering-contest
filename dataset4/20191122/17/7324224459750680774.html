      <p>This includes its production of the Golf GTI TCR racing car, which is eligible for a number of touring car series globally. According to Motorsport.com, this decision will also bring an immediate end to a TCR-regulated version of the Mk8 Golf, which is said to have been testing as recently as this week.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if this will have an effect on plans for new TCR road car, or production of the outgoing Mk7.5 Golf TCR.</p>
      <p>Sven Smeets, Volkswagen Motorsport director, said: “Electric mobility offers enormous development potential, and in this regard motorsport can be a trailblazer: on the one hand, it serves as a dynamic laboratory for the development of future production cars and, on the other, as a convincing marketing platform to inspire people even more towards electric mobility.</p>

      <p>“That is why we are going to focus more than ever on factory-backed electric drive commitments and continue to expand our activities with the development of the [latest Volkswagen car platform]. Innovative technology relevant to the car of the future is our focus.”</p>
      <p>The firm will continue to produce the Polo GTI R5 rally car for customer teams and provide support. It will however signal an end for any factory-backed efforts with the car.</p>
