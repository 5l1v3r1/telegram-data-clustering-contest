      <h1>Kamlesh Tiwari’s Wife Receives Death Threat Written In Urdu From Maharashtra; Lucknow Police Launch Probe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:19:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>Kiran Tiwari, wife of slain Hindu Samaj Party leader Kamlesh Tiwari, who was shot dead in broad daylight last month, has now received a death threat.</p>
      <p>According to Kiran Tiwari, who is now the president of the Hindu Samaj Party, she has received a letter from Latur in Maharashtra that threatened to eliminate her.</p>
      <p>The letter has purportedly been written by one Ganesh Nago Rao and two of the nine pages were written in Urdu.</p>
      <p>Kiran Tiwari said that though she received the letter on 14 November (Thursday), it took her time to get the Urdu pages translated. When the translation was done, it was found that the letter carried a death threat.</p>
      <p>Kiran has lodged a case in this regard at the Naka Hindola police station and has demanded Z-Plus security for herself.</p>
      <p>The Lucknow police have initiated investigations and is contacting its counterparts in Maharashtra to establish if the letter was actually written by Ganesh Nago Rao.</p>
      <p>Kamlesh Tiwari was shot dead in his office by two men who were later identified as Ashfaq and Moinuddin. Both were later arrested from Gujarat along with half a dozen others who helped them in either carrying out the murder or escaping after the crime.</p>
