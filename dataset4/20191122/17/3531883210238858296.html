      <p>To have not only the foresight to keep the original 1Malaysia Development Bhd audit report, but also the guts to do so at a time when the perpetrator was the most powerful public official in the nation, takes raw courage.</p>
      <p>I wonder how many times she had thought about destroying that crucial evidence when she turned up for work every day. She knew the dire consequences if she was caught with it.</p>
      <p>The National Audit Department director must have had countless sleepless nights worrying about the possibility of a raid and being arrested for being a national security threat under preventive laws or for offences under the Official Secrets Act.</p>
      <p>How many of her colleagues knew? Were they all trustworthy? She would have been worried, and feared everyone around her.</p>
      <p>All those who knew and kept silent are heroes, too. I presume that gave her further confidence.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the spectrum is the sad fact that she could not turn to the criminal justice system to seek proper action. This is the biggest let-down of all. Basically, she was on her own.</p>
      <p>We need to share her concerns with regard to the custodians of our justice system. A million times she must have contemplated the destruction of such a crucial piece of evidence, as the powers that be looked too powerful and draconian.</p>
      <p>Her courage – and fear – must have been extreme. Her worry for not just her own, but also her family’s safety must have been tremendous. However, she did not take the easy way out. She hung on to the file like her life depended on it.</p>
      <p>Duty, love for the nation, and doing what she believed to be the right thing gave her the courage to take this great risk.</p>
      <p>Nor Salwani is a true hero, and deserves the highest award for bravery. With all my heart, I salute her for the great service she has done for our nation.</p>
      <p>Her story must be told in great detail. Her courage and honour must be made known to all, so that young Malaysians truly understand how grave the 1MDB scandal was.</p>
      <p>It must be impressed upon all Malaysians that we can never go back to such a treacherous abuse of power.</p>
      <p>Nor Salwani is a shining example of the potential we all have within, as true Malaysians. We only need the right leadership to take us there. – November 22, 2019.</p>
