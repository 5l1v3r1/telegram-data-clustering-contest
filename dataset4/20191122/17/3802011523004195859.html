      <p>“Josiyas’s body was discovered hanging from a tree on the following day by a passer-by who then reported the matter to the police.</p>
      <p>“The police attended the scene and a search was carried which led to the discovery of the toddler’s body that was floating in the dam while Josiya’s vehicle was found parked near the dam.”</p>
      <p>Ass Insp Mukwende appealed to the public to solve their disputes amicably.</p>
      <p>“The police are appealing to members of the public to solve issues amicably by engaging third parties in the form of church elders, community leaders or elders as well as the police.
