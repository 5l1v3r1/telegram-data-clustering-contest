      <p>Adelani Adepegba, Abuja</p>
      <p>President of the United Nations General Assembly, Prof. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, has said that the UN remained committed to eradicating poverty and hunger across the world.</p>
      <p>He also said that the global body was committed to ensuring peace, security, and quality education worldwide.</p>
      <p>He stated this in Abuja on Friday, during his visit to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama as part of scheduled activities on his first official visit to the country as President of the UNGA.</p>
      <p>According to him, poverty eradication, ensuring peace and security, inclusion, quality education, climate action are in line with his vision and mandate as the 74th President of the UN General Assembly.</p>
      <p>He added that achieving the set-out vision and mandate would go a long way toward achieving the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
      <p>Bands said, “I am always conscious that I will not fail Nigeria in my capacity as President of the General Assembly at the 74th Session.</p>
      <p>“We have within two months set the proper pace and we are very happy that everyone that has had an association with the system has stated that we have started really well.</p>
      <p>“Our mandates are very clear as stated. Poverty eradiation must be key. So is peace and security. So will be education. So will be inclusion.”</p>
      <p>He said that the UN system had supported Nigeria in dealing with the regional problem of Boko Haram and it was glad to see that by all accounts, “there is light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
      <p>Onyeama pledged Nigeria’s support to Muhammad-Bande in his official mandate as President of the UNGA, saying that his vision was in tandem with the priorities of the government.</p>
