        <b>Hong Kong X’tals is stocking its Global Navigation Satellite System Disciplined Oscillator (GNSSDO) of the K-Star series at Rutronik.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The disciplined oscillator receives signals from satellites to generate one pulse-per-second output. It supports concurrent reception of signals from GPS, Glonass, Beidu and Galileo. The K-Star GNSSDO is available in a form factor of 155x165x55mm at Rutronik UK.</p>

      <p>The K-Star series GNSSDO is time and frequency synchronised to UTC and provides a low-noise 10MHz reference output.</p>
      <p>It can receive GNSS-signals with a sensitivity of -167dBm. With a long-term frequency stability that shows deviations of less than 1E-12, the K-Star achieves stratum 2 of the network time protocol and ITU-T Type II (G.812) of the International Telecommunication Union.</p>
      <p>The K-Star GNSSDO is able to learn and compensate the influence of temperature and aging characteristics thanks to its AOM system modelling algorithm.</p>
      <p>The oscillator’s holdover performance for the 1PPS output exceeds ±1.5μs accuracy over 24 hours under temperature variation of up to 20°C.</p>
      <p>The K-Star GNSSDO is suited for 4G and 5G LTE-TDD base stations. Other applications could be found in the energy industry where operators require an accurate time source to monitor the energy flow of their networks and finance and stock exchanges where accurate time stamping is required to trace all transactions.</p>
