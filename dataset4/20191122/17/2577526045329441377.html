      <h1>London's Pop-Up Pokémon Center Will Be Back Next Summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:01:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>If the temporary nature of London’s Pokémon Center meant you didn’t get a chance to visit for yourself, never fear. A press release earlier today confirmed that the store will be returning next summer during the Pokémon World Championships.</p>
      <p>That press release suggests the store received more than 30,000 visitors over the course of just four weeks (leading to enormous queues and limits on the amount of plushies guests could purchase). Despite issues with stock and <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/10/25/londons-pokemon-center-is-mobbed-with-no-tents-allowed">would-be campers</a>, that’s clearly enough people that The Pokémon Company is happy for the shop to open its doors once more.</p>
      <p>Next year’s venue is yet to be announced, but as London is the host city, I doubt we’ll be heading too far out of the South-East. We also don’t have exact dates, but the placeholder for the Championships - which feature both videogame and trading card formats - is August 21, so you might want some sunscreen if you plan to be waiting in those queues.</p>
