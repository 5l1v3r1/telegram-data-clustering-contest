      <p>There was heartbreak for Duleek NS in the Boys Div 1 Shield as they threw away a big lead with Louis Keane firing 2-2 to inspire a stunning comeback victory for St Seachnall's by 5-5 to 3-8.</p>

      <p>The final game of the day was mostly played in lashing rain and fading light, but huge credit must go to both St Columbanus NS and Robinstown for serving up a thriller in the Boys Div 2/3 Shield final which the Ballivor boys won 4-7 to 3-4.</p>
