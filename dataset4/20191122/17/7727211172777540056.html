      <h2>The council plans to knock down the building and replace it with a temporary car park</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/huyton">Huyton</a> wedding venue will close in the new year and could be knocked down and replaced with a temporary car park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley-council">Knowsley Council’s</a> cabinet agreed in a private session on Wednesday night to close <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/seven-things-youll-remember-you-16663297">The Venue</a> in Huyton town centre in the face of continued financial losses.</p>
      <p>Council documents reveal that The Venue was £87,000 in the red last year and is on course to lose the council £106,000 this year.</p>
      <p>The local authority estimated it would also need to invest £2.2 million over the next 10 years in maintaining the building, which is used for a range of events including concerts and weddings.</p>
      <p>A council spokesperson said: “Following a thorough review, Cabinet has made the decision to close The Venue in Huyton.</p>
      <p>“The building has been running at a financial loss and needs a significant amount of investment in the structure and fabric of the building to keep it open.</p>
      <p>“In addition, despite extensive efforts over the last six years to increase usage, it is under-utilised. The Venue will close on 1 January 2020.”</p>
      <p>When the possibility of closing The Venue <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/merseyside-wedding-venues-future-doubt-16824890">was floated in August</a> , a council spokesperson said the “current financial climate” and continuing cuts from central government meant the council “cannot continue to subsidise The Venue”.</p>
      <p>In its place, documents suggest, the council intends to provide a temporary car park at the cost of £450,000 but there is no indication of any longer-term plans for the site.</p>
      <p>A council report said: “The demolition of The Venue and the provision of a temporary surface car park will contribute to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/more-shop-fronts-being-transformed-17197460">proposed regeneration of the Huyton Village centre</a> and thereby enable accelerated business growth and the creation of new jobs and housing.”</p>
