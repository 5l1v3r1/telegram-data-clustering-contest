      <h1>Titans Season 2 Finale Promo Reveals the Nightwing Suit in Action</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:50:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>DC Universe has released a new promo for the upcoming <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/titans"><b>Titans</b></a> Season 2 Finale, which is just a week away from now. The teaser implies that one member of the Team will fall next week, as a new Titan will rise. It’s quite easy to guess the name of the one who rises, as we catch a glimpse of the brand new Nightwing suit for Dick Grayson.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen which Titan falls. It may be just a metaphor for the old identity of Dick Grayson, who has destroyed his Robin costume. But the trailer implies also that it may also be Raven, as she’s absent from the shot in which the team gathers. One thing is for sure, though: Deathstroke will play a pivotal role in the upcoming episode.</p>
      <p>You can watch the new <b>Titans </b>Season 2 finale promo in the player below.</p>
