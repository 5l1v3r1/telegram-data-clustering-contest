        <li>Find Location and tap to open the menu</li>
        <li>Turn of High accuracy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will increase the GPS accuracy and hopefully, the GPS on your phone will start working without any issues.</p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Update Google Maps</h4>

You should make sure you have the latest version of the app. What you need to do is to open Play Store, tap on the hamburger icon to open the menu and then tap My apps &amp; games. Find Google Maps, and if there is an update, install it.</p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Update the software</h4>
      <p>Software updates bring bug fixes, and not just that. They also bring security patches and some fresh features. That is why it is advisable to get the latest version as soon as it becomes available. To update the software on your Samsung Galaxy Note 9, follow the steps below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigate to Settings</li>
        <li>Now tap Software update</li>
        <li>Tap Check for updates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If there is a new version, follow the on-screen steps to download it and then install it.</p>
      <h4>Solution 7: Make sure your SIM card is not damaged</h4>

      <h4>Solution 8: Factory data reset</h4>
      <p>If nothing works, you should restore your phone to factory defaults. The first thing you need to do is creating a back up of your data because a factory reset deletes everything you store on your phone. When you are done, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings &gt; General Management</li>
        <li>Tap Reset &gt; Factory data reset</li>
        <li>Tap Reset</li>
        <li>Next, tap Delete All</li>
        <li>Enter your PIN, pattern, or password if required</li>
        <li>Tap Confirm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Wait for the phone to finish the process. Set it up from scratch.</p>
