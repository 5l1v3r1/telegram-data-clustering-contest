      <h1>Carli Lloyd Is Serious About Being An NFL Kicker After 2020 Olympics: “I Know I Can Do It’ (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>A few months ago, Carli Lloyd had social media buzzing when video surfaced of the U.S. Women’s National Team star nailing a 55-yard field goal. That moment has not left her mind.</p>
      <p>Lloyd is serious about pursuing an NFL kicking career, as she stated on “The Rich Eisen Show” on Wednesday.</p>
      <blockquote>“This isn’t just a publicity stunt or something that I’m having fun, just string the media along. I know that I can do it,” Lloyd said. “I know that I have the mental capacity in pressure situations. I know that there would be loads of people that want to see me fail. That’s no different than the entirety of my career.”</blockquote>

      <p>The two-time World Cup champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist said that she has even kicked field goals in full pads and a helmet. Right now, however, she is fully focused on making the 2020 Olympic soccer team before shifting her thoughts to the NFL.</p>
      <blockquote>“I definitely want to entertain it, but I want to be good at it,” Lloyd said. “I want to be able to do it. That’s ultimately what it comes down to.”<br/><br/>“There’s obviously a lot of other things that are a bit challenging, with big men on the line and people running at you.”</blockquote>
      <p>Lloyd also revealed that two NFL teams actually reached out with offers to kick in a preseason game, but she had to decline to her own playing schedule.</p>
      <p>“If I can help pioneer and break down some doors for other women in the future, that would be amazing,” Lloyd, 37, added.</p>
