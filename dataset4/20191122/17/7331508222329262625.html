      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers">Auburn</a> is retiring its 20-year-old golden eagle mascot two years after it was grounded from flying at football games because of heart disease.</p>
      <p>A university statement issued Friday said the bird named Nova is being replaced by another golden eagle named Aurea that will become War Eagle VIII.</p>
      <p>A ceremony marking the transition is planned for Auburn's home game against Samford on Saturday. Nova has been sidelined since 2017 after being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, which is a chronic heart disease.</p>

      <p>Nova made nearly 58 pregame flights since its debut in 2004, with the Tigers going 44-14 in those games. Veterinarian Seth Oster said in a statement that Nova will mostly be restricted to presentations at the university's raptor center.</p>
      <p>Aurea is a 5-year-old female with a more than 6.5-foot wingspan. Aurea was brought to the raptor center in 2016 with an injured wing.</p>
      <p>"Her flight stamina isn't quite good enough for her to be released into the wild, but it doesn't affect her flying in the stadium because she's not chasing a live animal," said Andrew Hopkins, assistant director of raptor training and education at Auburn.</p>
