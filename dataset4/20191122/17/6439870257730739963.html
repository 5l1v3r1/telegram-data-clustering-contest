      <p>JOHNSTON COUNTY, N.C. (WNCN) - The family of the man shot and killed while protecting his mother is calling him a hero.</p>
      <p>Joseph Bowling, 23, was killed last week at the Watchman near Benson. His family told CBS 17 he loved the outdoors, fishing and spending time with his nieces and nephews.</p>
      <p>“He touched many hearts in his lifetime. He was just that good of a person,” said his sister-in-law Emmily Mangum.</p>
      <p>Mangum said Bowling’s mom worked the night shift at the Scotchman near Benson. He’d often go sit with her during her shift.</p>
      <p>“He was a big mama’s boy. He loved his mama.”</p>
      <p>That’s what he was doing a week ago.</p>
      <p>It was the day after his 23rd birthday.</p>
      <p>Bowling was spending time with his mom at the gas station when a group walked in, demanding money.</p>
      <p>“From what I’m told, he told them to have what you want we don’t want no trouble,” said Mangum.</p>
      <p>She said Bowling went behind the counter to stand in front of his mom.</p>
      <p>The robbers took money and both their phones, said Mangum.</p>
      <p>Police said one of the suspects started firing inside the store, shooting and killing Bowling as he protected his mother.</p>

      <p>“I think everybody is in shock really. You never think it’ll be your family until something like that happens,” said Mangum.</p>
      <p>Bowling’s gathered for his wake and funeral this week.</p>
      <p>His loved ones say many people showed up to remember who they lovingly call “Scrap.”</p>
      <p>“He had a huge heart, like he’d give you the shirt off his back. He was an awesome person.”</p>
      <p>The gas station paid for his funeral.</p>
      <p>The family is raising money for the rest of the expenses. You can donate <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/burial-exspenses-for-joseph-bowling?utm_source=facebook.">here</a>.</p>
