      <p>Jordan Peele fans (Get Out, Us) rejoice – he has just produced a new Amazon series, Hunters, which comes out sometime in 2020. As an added bonus, it stars Al Pacino.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=111&amp;v=hYxTHcoRpNo&amp;feature=emb_logo">YouTube</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Inspired by true events, HUNTERS follows a diverse band of Nazi Hunters in 1977 New York City who discover that hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in America. And so, they do what any bad-ass vigilante squad would do: they set out on a bloody quest for revenge and justice. But they soon discover a far-reaching conspiracy and must race against time to thwart the Nazis’ new genocidal plans.</blockquote>
