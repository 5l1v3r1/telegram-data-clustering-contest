      <h2>The debutant takes four wickets to set up victory over Mumbai.</h2>

      <p>Left-arm spinner M. Siddharth starred on debut for Tamil Nadu with a brilliant four-wicket haul to set up an easy seven-wicket win over Mumbai in the Super League match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Electing to field, Siddharth and fellow left-arm spinner R. Sai Kishore spun a web around the Mumbai batsmen, picking seven wickets amongst them to restrict the opposition to just 121.</p>
      <p>In reply, TN openers M. Shahrukh Khan and C. Hari Nishanth attacked right from the beginning to give TN a blazing start.</p>
      <p>Nishanth looked like he was given the license to go for his shots and took on Mumbai bowlers — especially the spinners Dhrumil Matkar, Siddhesh Lad and Shams Mulani — with a swashbuckling unbeaten 73 (44b, 5x4, 6x6) to help his side make short work of the target in just 13.5 overs.</p>
      <p>For Mumbai, Mulani was the star performer of the day, making a valiant 73 and picking all three TN wickets.</p>
      <p>Put in to bat, Mumbai’s slide started from the first over, when Sai Kishore struck in the second ball of the match for TN — Aditya Tare dragged himself outside the crease as he went for an expansive drive only to miss it and get stumped.</p>
      <p>In the next over, the 21-year-old Siddharth got into the act off his third ball with a tossed up delivery to remove Suryakumar Yadav. The Mumbai skipper was bowled as he tried to give room and go inside out and missed completely.</p>
      <p>Prithvi Shaw and Shams Mulani then came together for a good partnership, going after the TN bowlers with a 42-run partnership for the third wicket. Shaw went after Washington Sundar in particular in the PowerPlay, hitting him for three boundaries and a six in his first two overs.</p>
      <p>Siddarth, who came back for his second spell, bowled Shaw with an arm ball whose bounce surprised the batsman. He then had Shreyas Iyer caught at long-off, getting a leading trying to go over the top before Siddhesh Lad offered a simple return catch off the last ball of his spell to finish with figures of 4/16.</p>
      <p>Sai Kishore then picked up two wickets in the 13th over, removing Shubham Ranjane bowled and Shivam Dube caught at long-on to reduce Mumbai to 78/7.</p>
      <p>Amidst the carnage at the other end, Mulani looked untroubled as he punished the TN bowlers whenever they erred, and made things happen with well-timed reverse sweeps in his knock of 73 (52b, 10x4, 1x6).</p>
      <p>Brief scores: Mumbai 121/9 in 20 overs (Shams Mulani 73, Prithvi Shaw 30, M. Siddharth 4/16, R. Sai Kishore 3/18) lost to Tamil Nadu 122/3 in 13.5 overs (C. Hari Nishanth 73 n.o., Shams Mulani 3/26).</p>
