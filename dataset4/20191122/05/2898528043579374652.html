      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:14:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:14</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>It appears <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3494/valentina-shevchenko">Valentina Shevchenko</a> has her next assignment as the women’s flyweight champion is expected to face surging contender <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3009/katlyn-chookagian">Katlyn Chookagian</a> at a UFC event currently scheduled for Feb. 8 in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources close to the situation confirmed the news to MMA Fighting on Thursday following an initial report from <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28129244/valentina-shevchenko-third-flyweight-defense-february-ufc-ppv">ESPN</a>. The UFC has made no official announcements about the fight or the Feb. 8 card, which is expected to be a pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>Regarded as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the sport, Shevchenko has run roughshod over the 125-pound division in the UFC ever since the weight class was first introduced.</p>
      <p>She’s currently 4-0 in the division with two title defenses already under her belt including a highlight reel knockout against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1287/jessica-eye">Jessica Eye</a> back in June. Shevchenko most recently fought in August when she defended her belt against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/519/liz-carmouche">Liz Carmouche</a> in a lopsided decision after five rounds.</p>
      <p>As for Chookagian, her opportunity to fight for UFC gold comes after building a 4-1 resume at flyweight inside the Octagon including two consecutive wins in a row.</p>
      <p>Chookagian has most recently defeated <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1848/joanne-calderwood">Joanne Calderwood</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2274/jennifer-maia">Jennifer Maia</a> while also holding wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1073/alexis-davis">Alexis Davis</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4113/mara-romero-borella">Mara Romero Borella</a> in the division.</p>
      <p>Now she will get the chance to pull off the upset against Shevchenko in a flyweight title fight that is expected to join the Feb. 8 UFC pay-per-view currently rumored for the Toyota Center in Houston.</p>
