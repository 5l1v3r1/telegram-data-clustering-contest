      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is already getting its <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday</a> on, with a discount of $200. But Amazon is also tossing in a free pair of Galaxy Buds for that same price.</p>
      <p>Basically, for $899, you're getting one of the best smartphones to come out this year, in the Galaxy Note 10+, and a pair of Galaxy Buds. Together, this would normally cost you close to $1400. That's a pretty sweet deal.</p>
      <p>We'd say that this is better than any other Black Friday deal for the Galaxy Note 10+ because the others require a trade-in. And you may not get the full value for your trade-in, to get the deal that Samsung is promoting for Black Friday.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy Note 10+ is a really great smartphone, sporting a large 6.4-inch display, which is a Quad HD+ curved AMOLED display. It also has the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That's nearly four-times the storage of the Pixel 4, for the same price.</p>
      <p>Samsung also included triple cameras on the backside, with an ultrawide, main and telephoto sensor. There's also a time of flight sensor back there that is going to help with the bokeh effects on Live Focus â€“ as well as Live Focus for Video. So that's a really cool addition here too.</p>
      <p>This is all powered by a massive 4200mAh capacity battery, that should keep it going all day long. And if it doesn't there is 45W fast charging available too. So you can quickly charge up on the go. Now, in the box, the included charger only does 25W, which is still really fast, but you'll need to buy Samsung's 45W fast charger to get that super fast charging on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.</p>
