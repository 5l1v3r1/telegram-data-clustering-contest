      <h1>How Grace Millane's dream trip turned to tragedy after Tinder date with sick killer</h1>
      <h2>University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane, 22, from Wickford, Essex, was fatally strangled in a New Zealand apartment at the hands of a man she met on a dating app</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:14:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:14</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, exploring new countries and getting a taste of different cultures.</p>
      <p>Graduate Grace Millane was full of excitement at embarking upon the exciting gap year adventure before she resigned to the daily 9-5 grind of a job.</p>
      <p>But instead of returning to her Essex home full of tales of her far-flung travels, she was reunited with her family in a coffin.</p>
      <p>It was a Tinder date with death that saw her promising life brought to a devastating end - and today the man was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grace-millane-man-found-guilty-20933408">found guilty</a> of her murder.</p>
      <p>The bright 22-year-old, from Wickford, spent her final hours in Auckland, New Zealand, sipping cocktails, giggling and sharing kisses before she was choked lifeless while having sex.</p>

      <p>Her body was later stuffed in the foetal position into a suitcase coffin and buried in a shallow grave with a blanket of mud and foliage shovelled on top.</p>
      <p>It would be days later, that police made the grisly discovery in a wooded area.</p>
      <p>Her family had reported her missing when she didn't reply to messages wishing her a happy 22nd birthday, on December 2, the day after the Tinder date.</p>
      <p>As police tried to piece together the backpacker's last known movements, a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/grace-millane-suppression-order-cant-20933973">26-year-old man</a> was arrested for her murder.</p>
      <p>Grace's bruised body was found the next day on December 9 - eight days after her death.</p>

      <p>It followed a "concise, stringent and thorough investigation" which saw more than 24 officers work around the clock with little sleep to solve the "heinous crime."</p>
      <p>The burial location, Waitakere Ranges, was a short drive from where Grace had last been seen entering the CityLife complex at 9.41pm with her date.</p>
      <p>It signalled an agonising end to a week of absolute hell for her loved ones.</p>
      <p>At her funeral on January 10, held at Brentwood Cathedral, in her hometown, mum Gill, dad David and brothers Michael and Declan described her as "our sunshine".</p>
      <p>Sassy and family-orientated Grace, whose laugh would light up a room, had recently graduated from the University of Lincoln with a degree in advertising and marketing.</p>

      <p>Before knuckling down and securing a job, she decided to go and enjoy herself on a gap year and travel the world until June.</p>
      <p>Her adventure began in mid-October, and she arrived in New Zealand on November 20, before she checked into an Auckland backpacker hostel.</p>
      <p>She loved the country, its people and the lifestyle.</p>
      <p>The night before her birthday, she arranged to have drinks with a man after making contact with him through the dating app Tinder.</p>
      <p>They met outside a 'winter wonderland' display, went to a trendy burger bar, as well as another popular drinking establishment.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Grace drank four mango cocktails, one tequila shot, two whisky cocktails and shared three half litre jugs of margaritas and sangria with the man.</p>
      <p>The pair were revelling in each other's company, with Grace messaging a friend: “I click with him so well”.</p>
      <p>At 9.29pm, just 11 minutes before leaving one of the bars, the man wrote: “Beautiful, very radiant” under Grace’s Facebook profile picture.</p>
      <p>The intoxicated pair then strolled arm-in-arm, hugged and shared kisses before walking to CityLife complex where her date had been living in a £190-a-week apartment.</p>
      <p>CCTV showed Grace following him out of the hotel lifts into the corridor at 9.41pm.</p>

      <p>It was the last time she was seen alive.</p>
      <p>The truth of what went on inside the apartment bedroom in the hours that followed is now only known by one person.</p>
      <p>But what is not disputed, is that Grace did not leave it alive.</p>
      <p>In court, the prosecution claimed her death by strangulation was murder, while the defence argued it was an accident.</p>
      <p>Her date claimed she encouraged him to put his hands around her neck as they were having consensual sexual intercourse.</p>

        <figcaption>The pair were seen on CCTV in the lift before heading to the man's hotel apartment</figcaption>

      <p>The murder trial heard she was a fan of the 50 Shades of Grey movies and had profiles on BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance and submission) websites.</p>
      <p>They were "in the heat of the moment" and their "judgment and perceptions were impaired by alcohol," the man's lawyer Ian Brookie told the court.</p>
      <p>The man claimed he fell asleep in the bathroom and when he woke up assumed Grace had left.</p>
      <p>But upon returning to the bedroom he found her lifeless with blood coming out of her nose, he told the court.</p>

      <p>“I picked her up and tried to wake her. I was like screaming 'Grace, Grace'," he said.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to shake her. I was listening to see if her breathing was coming through and that’s when I panicked. She was cold.”</p>
      <p>He claimed he had begun calling for an ambulance "but I didn’t hit the button because I was scared how bad it looked."</p>
      <p>The now 27-year-old added: "There’s a dead person in my room. I thought it looked terrible."</p>
      <p>However, his version of events was in court branded a “labyrinth of storytelling” by the prosecution, who instead argued the fateful night was a “compelling case of murder”. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>They alleged intimate photos were taken of Grace as she lay dead and that the man searched for and watched a number of hardcore pornographic videos.</p>
      <p>They claimed he had taken the “trophy photographs” because of a “morbid interest in a dead woman’s genitalia.”</p>
      <p>And they said he had been “seeking total domination and some sort of weird thrill over women who were his sexual partners”.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Brian Dickey argued that Grace’s sexual history, in which she practiced consensual choking with a former partner, was irrelevant.</p>
      <p>Mr Dickey added that evidence by expert pathology witnesses was clear that it would have taken between five and 10 minutes of sustained pressure before Grace died.</p>

      <p>"At some point of which she lost consciousness and would have become limp and lifeless and he had to carry on," he said.</p>
      <p>“And if that’s not reckless murder someone will have to explain to me what is.”</p>
      <p>After realising Grace was dead, rather than calling emergency services, the man made a number of other searches on his phone.</p>
      <p>They included “waitakere ranges”, the hills where he later buried Grace's body, and “hottest fire”.</p>
      <p>He also started to destroy evidence and threw Grace's phone in a park bin along with her clothes, bag and shoes, which have never been found.</p>
      <p>He bought cleaning supplies and - as Grace lay dead in his room - arranged a date with another woman he met through Tinder.</p>
      <p>The court heard a few hours later, he was drinking beers with the woman, a former journalist.</p>
      <p>“He was very intense, quite calm though," she said, adding that the conversation moved on to crime.</p>
      <p>“He said he had heard of a guy who asked his girlfriend to have rough sex with him including strangulation or suffocation and it had gone wrong and she had died in the process and he had got done for manslaughter."</p>

      <p>She told the court the man also said how her his police friends were “having a tough time because a lot of people are going missing.”</p>
      <p>He said a number of people were thought to be disappearing in the hills west of Auckland, where he would bury Grace’s body the next morning.</p>
      <p>Grace's parents wept along with their police chaperone as they watched footage of their daughter’s body being taken to the woods.</p>
      <p>The man was seen wheeling a luggage trolley into a lift at the complex before returning with the trolley laden with two suitcases, one of which he has since admitted contained Grace’s naked body.</p>
      <p>He also purchased a shovel and hired a red Toyota hatchback to drive to Waitakere Ranges where he dug a shallow grave and buried Grace.</p>
      <p>He told jurors "The whole time I just kept saying, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry’.”</p>

      <p>He claims he then tried to take an overdose but the prosecution said this was a lie in a bid to try and "make out he’s a decent human being.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mr Dickey refuted the man's versions of events and instead said it was a “compelling case of murder”.</p>
      <p>He argued: "It’s not safe sex play that killed Grace Millane, it’s strangulation.</p>
      <p>“She must have gone limp and he must have carried on and that must be murder.”</p>
      <p>The jury of seven women and five men returned a unanimous guilty verdict after just five hours deliberation at Auckland High Court.</p>
      <p>Grace's parents have sat in court over the past three weeks listening to the harrowing details of their daughter's death.</p>
      <p>In a tearful speech outside the court, dad David said: "The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace.</p>
      <p>"It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year. Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>"This will be with us for the rest of our lives. Grace was a beautiful, talented, loving daughter. Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever. She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way on her gap year.</p>
      <p>"We must return home and try and pick up the pieces of our lives... without our beloved Grace."</p>
