      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The Legislative Yuan on Friday (November 22) approved the NT$247.23 billion (US$8.1 billion) budget to procure 66 F-16V jets from the United States.</p>
      <p>The passage of the third reading for the budget happened quickly and with only NT$10 million being cut from the government proposal, allowing the military to sign an agreement with the U.S. next month, the Central News Agency reported.</p>
      <p>The “Viper” jets will eventually be stationed at the Zhihang Air Force Base in Southeastern Taiwan’s Taitung County.</p>
      <p>According to a motion passed last October 29, a maximum limit of NT$250 billion was imposed on the special budget for the jets.</p>
      <p>Government officials had described the approval of the sale by the U.S. as proof that Washington regarded Taiwan as a key partner in its Indo-Pacific strategy as China continued strengthening its military, and in particular its Air Force and Navy.</p>
      <p>The fact that it took Taiwan’s lawmakers less than a month to pass the third reading of the budget could be described as fast, according to CNA. Legislators from both government and opposition agreed to drop the frequent one-month negotiation period available in such cases due to what they regarded as the importance of the jet deal to the country’s defense capabilities.</p>
