      <p>The South Okanagan Real Estate Board’s annual Warm Up for Winter event provided everything from blankets to boots for free to anyone who needed them on Thursday, the product of two large cube trucks full of donations from the community.</p>
      <p>Lori Lancaster, who helped organize the event at St. Saviours Church Hall, said they collected two large cube trucks chock full of winter season needs. </p>
      <p>"I was quite nervous we wouldn't have enough, but as you can see, we have more than enough, so it's fantastic," Lancaster said, gesturing to the large hall filled with clothing racks, tables piled high with toques and gloves, and plenty of blankets. </p>
      <p>Members of SOREB also donated snacks to hand out in case anyone was hungry, and volunteers from the real estate board as well as the church kept the hall tidy and helped customers. </p>
      <p>"And create a unique free shopping experience!" Lancaster said. </p>
      <p>For her, the cause hits close to heart. </p>
      <p>"Last year was my first time doing it, as being a mother, a working mother, it really spoke to me to see the mums rushing in here after work," Lancaster said. </p>
      <p>"These are individuals that have jobs, that unfortunately life is just so expensive now, but we have functioning, working families that actually need this service to provide for their families."</p>
      <p>She said watching kids picking out items and knowing they will get to go to school with items they are proud of means everything. </p>
      <p>"That is the key for our real estate board, we want to give the gratitude back that we have had in a successful run in the market. We want to give back to the community," Lancaster explained. </p>
      <p>Any items remaining after the shopping spree will be donated to local organizations. </p>
