      <h1>Israeli Prime Minister alleges attempted ‘coup’ after being formally indicted on corruption charges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:44:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has angrily accused prosecutors of an “attempted coup” after being indicted in a series of corruption cases, throwing Israel’s political system into disarray.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu, who’s had a 10 year grip on power, is refusing to resign.</p>
      <p>The disgraced leader was indicted on corruption charges, including bribery, breach of trust and fraud, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced on Friday (Australian time) following a three-year investigation. </p>
      <p>“A day in which the attorney general decides to serve an indictment against a seated prime minister for serious crimes of corrupt governance is a heavy and sad day, for the Israeli public and for me personally,” Mr Mandelblit, who was appointed by Mr Netanyahu, told reporters.</p>
      <p>Pink champagne and cigars are some of the thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts Israeli Mr Netanyahu is alleged to have accepted from billionaire friends, including Australian James Packer.</p>
      <p>It is the first time in the country’s history that a serving Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu is suspected to have been bribed with hundreds of thousands of dollars of champagne and cigars so that wealthy businessmen like Mr Packer could see their political interests advanced.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu denied acting inappropriately in exchange for them, relegating the gifts to mere symbols of friendship.</p>
      <p>Following Mr Mandelblit’s decision to indict him, Mr Netanyahu said :</p>
      <blockquote>“We are witnessing a government coup attempt”.</blockquote>
      <p>The prime minister said “it should be blind to not see that something bad is going on in the police and the prosecutor’s office”, news website <i>Walla</i> reported.</p>
      <p>He has also been accused of striking a deal with the owner of Israel’s daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth to receive favourable media coverage in return for legislation that would slow the growth of competing newspaper Israel Hayom.</p>
      <p>It is further alleged Mr Netanyahu promoted regulatory decisions that favoured Israeli telecommunications giant Bezeq in exchange for favourable coverage on <i>Walla!</i></p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu, who has vehemently denied wrongdoing in three corruption cases, is under no legal obligation to resign after being charged. </p>
      <p>The charges have increased pressure on him to resign, heightening uncertainty over who will lead a country mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections this year.</p>
      <p>It is understood the entire process of an indictment and trial could take two years. He would therefore only be forced to step down from the post if he is eventually convicted.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu said he was the victim of a politically orchestrated “witch-hunt” by the media and his left-wing opponents who wanted to force him from office.</p>
      <p>The indictment may still not be “the end of the story”, according to Hugh Lovatt, Israel-Palestine analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
      <p>“Israel will now have to brace for a political roller-coaster ride over the coming months. Now more than ever Netanyahu will be fighting for his political and personal life,” Mr Lovatt told <i>Al Jazeera</i>.</p>
      <p>Police recommended in February Mr Mandelblit file criminal charges against the right-wing prime minister in the long-running investigations dubbed Cases 1000, 2000 and 4000.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully accepting $US264,000 ($388,598) worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons and of dispensing favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by Israel’s biggest-selling newspaper, <i>Yedioth Ahronoth</i>, and the <i>Walla</i> website.</p>
      <p>Israel’s longest-serving premier could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum 3-year term for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
