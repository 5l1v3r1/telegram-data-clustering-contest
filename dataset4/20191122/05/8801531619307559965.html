      <p>The Karnataka High Court has directed the Principal Secretary (Home department) or any other official incharge in the state government to file an affidavit by Tuesday, detailing the number of detention centers in Bengaluru and other districts of the state, to house illegal foreign nationals, staying without valid visa, in the state. Also list out steps on how state will take care of them if they came out on bail or after conviction.</p>
      <p>Justice K N Phaneendra while hearing a bunch of bail applications filed by alleged Bangladeshi nationals, Babu Khan and others, who have been arrested for staying illegally in the state, under the Foreigners Registration Act said "What is the remedy after conviction or grant of bail? Who has to take care of the accused and how? State machinery will have to take care."</p>
      <p>The bench was informed that the constitutional court is hearing a Public Interest Litigation, in regards to a similar issue raised. To which the court said "I am only concerned with the judicial proceedings before me. I have not disposed off matters because of this particular issue as it is a continuous offence, even if the accused is released on bail or after conviction."</p>
      <p>The state government informed the court 58 illegal foreign nationals will be deported on Friday to the respective countries. Around 566 foreigners are at present detained at various locations in the state. Advocate for the Union Government, informed the court that as per the International Convention, the foreign national is deported back to his/her respective countries and if the other country does not accept them, as was in the case of terrorist, Ajmal Kasab, detenu has to be kept in India for his life at the cost of the taxpayers money. This is how a civilized country like ours treats them. Such cases are very few and maintaining the persons is not a big burden to the country. The court has now posted the matter for further hearing, on November 26.</p>
