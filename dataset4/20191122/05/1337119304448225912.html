      <h1>Google really wants you to hack the Pixel’s Titan M security chip</h1>
      <h2>The company’s bug bounty program boosted to a $1.5 million top prize</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jon-porter" target="_blank">Jon Porter</a></address>
      <p>Google has increased the maximum prize for its Android bug bounty program to $1 million for anyone who can compromise the Titan M security chip found in its Pixel phones. The top prize is for a “full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence” of the dedicated security chip. On top of that, there’s an additional 50 percent bonus if a security researcher is able to find an exploit on specific developer preview versions of Android, resulting in a potential prize of $1.5 million. The new rewards take effect starting today.</p>
      <p>Introduced with 2018’s Pixel 3, Google’s Titan M security chip <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-titan-m-security-chip-pixel-3/">cordons off your smartphone’s most sensitive data</a> from its main processor to protect against certain attacks. Google says the chip offers “on-device protection for login credentials, disk encryption, app data, and the integrity of the operating system.” Since its introduction, the chip has also been integrated with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18295348/google-android-phone-fido-webauthn-phishing-two-factor-authentication">Android’s security key functionality</a> where it’s used to store a person’s FIDO credentials. Suffice it to say, the integrity of the Titan M is an important element for the security of recent Pixel devices.</p>
      <aside>Google has now paid out over $4 million as part of its Android Security Rewards program</aside>
      <p>Along with the Titan M reward, Google has also announced a number of new categories of exploits to the Android Security Rewards program, which it launched in 2015. These go up to $500,000 and include exploits involving data exfiltration and lock screen bypass. Full details are available on the <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">program’s rewards page</a>.</p>
      <p>Google says it’s paid out a total of $1.5 million in 2019 as part of its bug bounty program for a total of over $4 million over the last four years. In 2019, Google awarded an average bounty of over $15,000 per researcher. The biggest single reward given out this year was $161,337, for the first reported “1-click remote code execution exploit chain on the Pixel 3 device.”</p>
