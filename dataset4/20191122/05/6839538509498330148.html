      <p>It’s enough to make your heart melt. Yorkes schoolchildren have thanked their hometown bushfire heroes with gorgeous handwritten cards.</p>
      <p>St Columba’s Memorial School students at Yorketown delivered handmade thank you cards to Country Fire Services volunteers on Thursday alongside a short video expressing their gratitude.</p>
      <p>The school community is banding together after some of their staff and students’ families lost properties in the blaze that <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/71f5b7314b2dac73cf4d2ab55e294823">burnt 5000ha in the southern Yorke Peninsula earlier this week</a>.</p>

      <p>The primary school was closed on Wednesday due to catastrophic fire danger rating issued for the district and the day reached 43.9C.</p>
      <p>Assistant principal Miriam Honner said 25 out of 84 students returned to the R-7 school on Thursday.</p>
      <p>She said the thank you letters helped the children “looked towards the positive” amid the loss locals now face.</p>
      <p>“In a bad situation, look to the people who helped,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We got them to think about the firefighters and away from the damage and the fire.”</p>

      <p>The students wrote dozens of letters and made salads, which were handed to Country Fire Service volunteers at the Yorketown RSL staging area.</p>
      <p>One card read, “Thank you for everything you did for us we are so lucky to have you. From SCMS”.</p>
      <p>Another, with a picture of water bombers dousing flames, read: “Thank you for protecting us from the fire. We are thinking about your bravery and achievement.”</p>
