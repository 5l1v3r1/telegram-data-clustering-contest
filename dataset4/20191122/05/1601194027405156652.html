      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a> has been in the headlines recently over his comments about losing his passion for fighting. He's on a 2-fight losing skid and has lost 3 out of his last 4 since 2016. He most recently fought this past July where he was knocked out cold by <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, he's been focused on outside ventures and says that he's happy to not be fighting again. In the same interview with <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-RTzjByfM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Submission Radio</a></i>, Rockhold revealed an interesting proposition that would get him back to the Octagon sooner - a 195-pound division!</p>
      <p>Since his last fight showed that he was small for Light Heavyweight and he had to cut too much for Middleweight, this is the weight class that's ideal for him. He said (H/T <b><i><a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/luke-rockhold-says-hed-consider-returning-if-ufc-adds-195-pound-division">BJPenn.com</a></i></b>):</p>
      <blockquote>“Weight issues, trying to make weight. For me, I feel like I’m killing myself to get down to 185, so I don’t see it. That was my reasoning. More weight classes, add them in. Where’s that 195-weight division? Then maybe I think about coming back.”</blockquote>
      <p>This is probably the first time that a <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> fighter has proposed the idea of a 195-pound division. Over the last year and a half, the biggest talk among the roster was to introduce a 165-pound division and it made sense since there would be a lot of talent coming over from both Lightweight (the most stacked division of the roster) and Welterweight.</p>
      <p>The talent pool at 165 would be unbelievable but despite the pleas from the roster, Dana White insisted that there are no plans to make a 165-pound division right now. As for Rockhold, he's going to have to wait around longer to see where he wants to return.</p>
      <p>He has stated that he's happy not fighting right now so it's likely that we're going to see him have another long layoff. It's probably for the best and we hope that he comes back stronger than ever!</p>
