      <p>"If it's cold, let them in." A mantra for pet owners, but most people would agree that this does not apply to rats.</p>
      <p>There was a significant increase in the rat population in the Okanagan this summer with social media pages buzzing about the pests taking over yards and gardens.</p>
      <p>Social media is once again buzzing about rats, but now it's about the rodents looking for a warm place to spend the winter.</p>
      <p>Matt Wright, with Orkin Vernon, said rats can find their way into a home through even the smallest of openings.</p>
      <p>But there are things people can do to keep the critters out of the house.</p>
      <p>“They are looking for any place out of the weather, so they will look at sheds, garages and stuff like that for sure,” said Wright. “Attics are a top priority for them because they are nice and warm up there.”</p>
      <p>Wright recommends cutting back trees and shrubs from touching the house so rats cannot climb up onto the roof and find a way in.</p>
      <p>It is also a good idea to get rid of any fruit, such as fallen apples, that may still may still be in the yard as that will be an attractant for the rodents.</p>
      <p>The compost should be turned over regularly, or be put in a rodent-proof bin will also reduce attractants for the critters.</p>
      <p>Wright said snap traps, live traps – where the rats will then be relocated – or poisons are the only way to wage war on rats.</p>
      <p>Some people on social media expressed concerns about using poisons on rats for fear a cat, owl or some other domestic predator would then eat the poisoned rat and die, but Andrea Deneumoustier with Pest Detective, said the poison is placed in bait traps so no other animals can get at it.</p>
      <p>And if a cat or bird does eat a poisoned rat, Deneumoustier said the amount of poison in the rat's system would not harm the larger animals.</p>
      <p>“The amount of rats they would have to consume would be a lot,” she said.</p>
