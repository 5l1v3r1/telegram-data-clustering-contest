      <p>No wonder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kartik-Aaryan">Kartik Aaryan</a> is a busy bee these days. After taking a few hours break from his 'Dostana 2' shoot to launch a new song, 'Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare', from '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pati-Patni-Aur-Woh">Pati Patni Aur Woh</a>', he returned to complete his pending 'Dostana 2' shoot in Patiala and the handsome hunk is back in Mumbai to celebrate his birthday.</p>
      <p>As the actor had no special plans on his birthday due to his work schedule, his parents decided to surprise their sweetheart with a small birthday celebration. Today, Kartik took to his Instagram handle to share a few pictures from the bash.</p>
      <p>He adorably captioned pictures and shared,"Jab Mummy Papa ne bday pe surprise kiya ...‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫." In the pictures, we can see Kartik's parents wishing him happy birthday as the young lad cuts the cake. The cake table can be seen decorated with colorful ballons with Kartik's pictures on each and candles. In one of the pictures, Kartik is offering a cake piece to his mother while in the other he is posing with the very delicious looking two chocolate cakes.</p>
      <p>While one cake says 'Happy birthday, Kartik', the other has his nickname 'Kaki' written over it.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Kartik Aaryan just finished his 'Dostana 2' shoot with Janhvi Kapoor and is now geared up for his next release,'Pati Patni Aur Woh'. Kartik also has a film alongside Sara Ali Khan, titled, '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Love-Aaj-Kal">Love Aaj Kal</a> 2'.</p>
