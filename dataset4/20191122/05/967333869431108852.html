        <b>A man has alarmed the small Russian town of Koltushi, located near St. Petersburg with gunfire purportedly from a military-grade assault rifle. The incident has been caught on video by local eyewitnesses.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The video depicting the incident shows a couple of obscure silhouettes allegedly grappling on the balcony of an apartment block.</p>
      <blockquote>A female eyewitness, who purportedly filmed the incident, says in Russian: "Take a look! What are they doing there? Fighting? Wow...!" and after a brief comment by the eyewitness, automatic weapon shots are fired. </blockquote>

      <p>The quality of the footage makes it impossible to identify the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201812131070638043-russia-weapons-super-gun-defence/">exact type of weapon used by the individual</a>. Local media said that police have responded to the incident. There has been no information on damage or casualties. The shooter reportedly opened fire after a family squabble.</p>
