      <p>Bihar government's alcohol ban in the state may or may not have delivered desired results yet, but the move has put a huge burden on the judiciary.</p>
      <p>The judiciary, already burdened with a large number of pending cases, has to now settle over 200,000 prohibition-related cases, including nearly 40,000 bail petitions pending with the Patna High Court.</p>
      <p>The HC has asked Nitish Kumar-led <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bihar-government">Bihar government </a>to explain the details of the infrastructure and mechanism it plans to develop to deal with mounting prohibition-related cases, according to a news report in The Times of India.</p>
      <p>"In how many such cases has the state government appealed the high court's order in the Supreme Court?," a bench asked advocate general Lalit Kishore.</p>
      <p>In reply, the advocate general said the state government had moved the SC on several occasions but he didn't mention the number of cases.</p>
      <p>The bench also sought to know what action the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bihar-government">Bihar government </a>has taken to pursue the cases filed in the SC challenging the enforcement of prohibition in the state.</p>
      <p>Till date, 167,000 people have been arrested on charges of violating the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 and more than 5 lakh litres of alcohol have been seized, the report said.</p>
