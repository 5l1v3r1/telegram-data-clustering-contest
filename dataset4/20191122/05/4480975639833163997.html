      <p>Analysts at Rabobank recently came out with their check of the United Kingdom’s (UK) opposition Labour Party manifesto that was released on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <blockquote>Labour is pledging to: boost spending on health, with up to 5% pay-rises for front-line staff; raise the minimum wage from GBP8.21 to 10; freeze the age of receiving a pension at 66.<br/><br/>Introduce a National Care Service; move to net-zero carbon emissions within the 2030s; nationalise the big-six energy firms, the national grid, water, Royal Mail, the railways.<br/><br/>Broadband (which will be free); move towards a 4-day week; start a new benefits system; free bus travel for under 25s; build 100,000 council homes a year; and abolish university tuition fees.<br/><br/>Taxes will also rise by GBP80bn via 5% income tax increases for top earners; large corporation tax up from 19% to 26%; capital gains tax equalised with income tax; inheritance tax thresholds lowered to a level far below the average price of a house in the Southeast; taxing second homes; and placing VAT on private education.<br/><br/>The Institute for Fiscal Studies rejects Labour’s claims that this will mean no tax change for 95% of Brits, and states these plans would raise the tax burden to the highest level since WW2, even surpassing the Denis Healey “Squeeze the rich until the pips squeak” 70’s.<br/><br/>Obviously, markets don’t like it – but will voters? Do these bread and lots of butter matters outweigh the Tories’ Brexit focus?<br/><br/>For now, there is still no Tory manifesto, just a--relatively--feeble promise to raise the National Insurance threshold over five years, eventually putting GBP500 a year in people’s pockets.<br/><br/>GBP will therefore be watching with keen interest as we move towards seeing what is on offer when the Conservatives “put their right arm in; their right arm out; in, out, in, out and shake it all about.”</blockquote>
