      <p>Gap Inc on Thursday reported better-than-expected quarterly net sales, nearly two weeks after the retailer's longtime Chief Executive Officer Art Peck stepped down, sending its shares up 4per cent.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Apparel retailer Gap Inc nudged past tempered quarterly profit expectations and reiterated its plan to separate Old Navy from the namesake brand.</p>
      <p>Gap replaced longtime Chief Executive Officer Art Peck with Robert Fisher, a member of the founding family, as its interim head nearly two weeks ago and cut its full-year profit forecast, blaming weak traffic and operating challenges across key brands.</p>

      <p>"We continue to make progress against our separation plans, which will provide improved focus and a further catalyst for transformation," said Fisher.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based retailer, which has long struggled to grow sales at two of its flagship brands, reported net sales that fell 2.2per cent to US$4 billion in the third quarter ended Nov. 2, but still beat the analysts' average estimate of US$3.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>"We are not pleased with the third quarter results and are focused on aggressively addressing the operational issues that are hindering the performance of our brands," Fisher said.</p>
      <p>The retailer in February said it would separate its better-performing Old Navy brand, giving investors hopes that the standalone company would be able to show better results than the Gap brand.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, the company earned 53 cents per share, compared with the analysts' average estimate of 51 cents.</p>
      <p>The company earlier this month said it was expecting to earn between 50 cents to 52 cents per share.</p>
      <p>Gap's shares, which have fallen 37per cent this year, were up about 3per cent in trading after the bell.</p>
