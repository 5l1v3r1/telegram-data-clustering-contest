      <h1>Uber will ‘soon’ begin recording background audio during your rides</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/20/uber-plans-start-audio-recording-rides-us-safety/">The Washington Post</a>, Uber is planning to start recording audio during trips in the United States for added safety.</p>
      <p>The feature, which was first spotted by <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/09/uber-record-audio-feature/">Jane Manchun Wong in late September</a>, will allow the Uber app to record rides in an attempt to protect both drivers and riders from harassment.</p>
      <p>Users can either opt into the feature for each ride or activate recording for all rides. Additionally, both drivers and riders will not be able to listen to playback audio.</p>
      <p>“When the trip ends, the user will be asked if everything is okay and be able to report a safety incident and submit the audio recording to Uber with a few taps,” Uber explained in documents obtained by The Washington Post.</p>
      <p>If an audio recording is submitted, it will be further evaluated by Uber’s customer support agents.</p>
      <p>The company later confirmed that the new feature will begin rolling out in the US “soon” but didn’t state when or if it will be made available worldwide.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Uber last week also launched its <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/uber-ridecheck-south-africa/">RideCheck safety feature</a> in South Africa.</p>
