        <b>A Spanish corporation and an NHS trust are researching whether patients’ mobile data could be used to predict mental health crises.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Telefonica, which owns mobile firm O2, is working with Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust to see whether using call records, location information and other forms of “mobile network data” can be used to flag people about to go into crisis.</p>
      <p>Neither the company nor the trust would confirm what sort of mobile data would be used in the project, and whether this would include details from the content of messages and internet searches.</p>
      <p>The trust told <i>HSJ</i>: “[This part] of the predictive analytics project is still in its infancy and the trust is in consultation with national and local partners to determine the project plan.”</p>
      <p>The trust, which is working with service user groups to develop a webpage and information leaflet, has approached the Information Commissioner’s Office about phase two of the project, according to board papers. The trust told <i>HSJ</i> it has spent roughly £8,250 on advice from a QC about “consent, communications and data processing elements”.</p>
      <p>However, a confidentiality and consent campaign group has raised concerns about the lack of clarity surrounding the role of mobile data in the project.</p>
      <p>Sam Smith from medConfidential told <i>HSJ</i>: “Why the secrecy and refusal to answer simple questions?</p>
      <p>“They’re withholding the details, but it appears Telefonica want detailed mental health data in return for nothing much — it’s unclear whether this work meets national norms for ‘innovation,’ and the secrecy certainly shouldn’t.</p>
      <p>“What do O2 have to hide about how they’re matching call records with NHS mental health data?”</p>
      <p>A Telefonica spokesman said: “We strongly believe in the importance of doing this research in the right way, and as we look to improve the predictions provided to clinicians through a second phase, we are working closely with the trust and the regulators to carefully plan the work.”</p>
      <p>The trust has already completed a pilot project with the company. The project team used anonymised historical health records to build an algorithm that aims to flag patients at risk of crisis. This “phase one” algorithm did not use mobile network data.</p>
      <p>The team tested the algorithm on 25 service users over a six-month pilot project, and hopes to launch a clinical investigation next year, according to the trust’s <a href="https://www.bsmhft.nhs.uk/about-us/trust-documents/board-papers/2019/?assetdet1104285=98746&amp;categoryesctl1106359=874">October board papers</a>.</p>
      <p>In parallel, they will investigate whether mobile network data, including location details and call and message records, can improve the algorithm.</p>

      <h4><anchor name="Phase_one_algorithm"/>“Phase one” algorithm</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The algorithm uses information such as referrals, contact with services, prior crises, and missed appointments</li>
        <li>Every two weeks, clinicians receive a stratified list of 25 patients, flagging those deemed at risk of crisis within the next 28 days</li>
        <li>Clinicians decide whether to take “proactive” steps, such as contacting them by phone or offering an outpatient appointment</li>
        <li>Roughly two-thirds of 60 clinicians in four community health teams found the algorithm beneficial in a pilot</li>
        <li>Researchers are planning a clinical investigation of the algorithm</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><anchor name="Phase_two_algorithm"/>“Phase two” algorithm</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The team think introducing mobile network data could reduce the number of “false positives” produced by the “phase one” algorithm</li>
        <li>They are researching whether mobile data can be combined with health records to improve the algorithm</li>
        <li>If successful, this “phase two” algorithm may be used to create a mobile application</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>The trust received support from the Health Research Authority’s research ethics committee for its “phase one” pilot. It told <i>HSJ</i> it “actively” engaged with the patients involved before and during the pilot. The trust did not seek consent for the use of historical health records used to train the algorithm because this data “cannot be linked to an individual patient”.</p>
      <p>The trust told <i>HSJ</i>: “Clinicians hope to see the current phase one algorithm developed and embedded into their routine practice as a clinical support tool.</p>
      <p>“This would provide an additional input into existing clinical decision making and enhance their risk and caseload management.</p>
      <p>“The vision is that this will allow clinicians to intervene and offer support to service users before they reach a crisis.”</p>
      <p>The Telefonica spokesman said: “We are proud of what we’ve achieved so far in phase one, analysing historic, anonymous health data, and we are excited to be working with the trust as its clinicians test these algorithms as an aid to their practice.”</p>
      <p>The project stems from the first wave of a national “test bed” programme, which ran from 2016 to 2018. Announced by Simon Stevens, the NHS England programme helped fund innovative initiatives between NHS bodies, other regional groups and commercial partners.</p>
      <p>The first phase also received funding from Telefonica and The Health Foundation, via the trust’s research and innovation department, which is externally funded, for the first phase.</p>
      <p>The phase two project is funded by Telefonica and the trust using global digital exemplar funding, according to the board papers.</p>
      <p>An NHS England spokesman told <i>HSJ</i> it is not involved in the second phase of the project.</p>
      <h3><anchor name="HSJ_Transforming_Mental_Health_Summit"/>HSJ Transforming Mental Health Summit</h3>
      <p>The HSJ Transforming Mental Health Summit, taking place at the <b>Hilton Leeds</b> from <b>28-29 November 2019</b>, unites 120+ senior figures from across the NHS, local authority and wider mental health service delivery landscape to discuss how to realise the visions of the NHS long-term plan and ensure successful local implementation of national priorities.</p>
      <p>Held under the Chatham House Rule, attendees will quiz Paul Farmer and other national figures on general policy direction and co-develop solutions to their local challenges with NHS and local government colleagues from across the country. The summit is free to attend for senior NHS and public sector figures.</p>
