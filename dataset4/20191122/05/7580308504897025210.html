      <p>The bulls maintained dominance at the end of transactions yesterday, on the equities sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), as market capitalisation appreciated further by N46 billion.<br/> <br/>The All Share Index (ASI) rose by 95.94 points or 0.36 per cent to 26,872.09 points.

      <p>Analysts expressed optimism that the equities market would sustain the gains in the near term, but, noted that sentiment still remains weak.<br/>   <br/>For instance, analysts at United Capital Plc, said: “Looking ahead, we still expect investors to position in value and dividend paying stocks, in expectation of making solid gains.”<br/>   <br/>Market breadth closed positive as 21 stocks posted gains while 12 declined.

Ikeja Hotel edged 9.62 per cent to close at N1.14 per share.<br/>   <br/>FCMB Group appreciated by 7.39 per cent to close at N2.18 per share.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), led the losers’ chart with 10 per cent to close at N18 per share.<br/> <br/>Jaiz Bank followed with eight per cent to close at 69 kobo, and Lasaco Assurance 7.41 per cent to close at 25 kobo, per share.<br/>   <br/>Unilever Nigeria lost 5.68 per cent to close at N17.45, while Unity Bank for Africa shed 1.94 per cent to close at N7.60, per share.<br/>   <br/>However, the total volume traded dropped by 10.5 per cent to 239.22 million shares, worth N2.28 billion, traded in 3,585 deals.   <br/>   <br/>Transactions in the shares of FBN Holdings topped the activity chart with 74.03 million shares valued at N558.42 million.
