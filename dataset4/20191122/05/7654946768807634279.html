      <p>President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on Thursday met the caskets of two soldiers <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/2-us-service-members-killed-in-chopper-crash-in-afghanistan/">killed Wednesday in a helicopter crash</a> in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The first couple went unannounced to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to salute the remains of fallen heroes David Knadle, of Texas, and Kirk Fuchigami Jr., of Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Trump was also accompanied by Army Gen. and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, and National Security Adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien.</p>
      <p>The president and his entourage stood at attention as six military personnel in army fatigues, white gloves and black berets lifted flag-draped transfer cases onto a van.</p>
