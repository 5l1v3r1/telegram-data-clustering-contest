      <p>The company in February said it would separate its better-performing Old Navy brand, giving investors hopes that the standalone company would be able to show better results than the Gap brand.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based company said net sales fell 2.2per cent to US$4 billion in the third quarter ended Nov. 2, but was still above the analysts' average estimate of US$3.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
