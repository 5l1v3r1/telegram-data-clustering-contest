      <p>“You have these handed over to you, yet you said you have inherited an economic mess. Meanwhile, your own GDP, today, is on the basis of those two oil fields that have been handed over to you. Since the 1980s, we have always known that every three or so years, we go through an energy crisis”, he said on Wednesday at the NDC’s forum on the 2020 budget presented by the Finance minister last week.</p>
