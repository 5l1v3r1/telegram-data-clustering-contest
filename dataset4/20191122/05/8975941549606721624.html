      <p>Money makes the world go around, but most Americans aren’t keen on investing their money around the world. That’s a bit short-sighted, given that the U.S. economy is growing at a slower pace, and U.S. stocks currently look expensive relative to that growth.</p>
      <p>So, if you’re inclined to spend money abroad without actually going there, check out a timely story on where in the world to put your money now, and why. Also, don’t miss MarketWatch’s coverage of the mutual-fund success story that is Vanguard Group, why negative-yielding bonds might appeal to retirees, and an interview with economist Robert Shiller about catalysts that could drive U.S. stocks “substantially” higher.</p>
