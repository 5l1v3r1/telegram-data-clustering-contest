      <p>The official, moreover, have been asked to take action against people that have invaded the areas.</p>
      <p>Deputy Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Juliana Shonza, issued the order when she launched the sports for health care campaign at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma recently.</p>
      <p>Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, in cooperation with other government sectors, organized the campaign that aimed at backing efforts to curb such non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, sickle cells and mental disorder.</p>
      <p>The weeklong event, which brought together government officials, saw participants compete in events, which include basketball, tug-of-war, marathon and netball.</p>
      <p>Juliana pointed out communities have to embrace fitness exercises, since report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children show non communicable diseases affect low income earners.</p>
      <p>“Prevention is better than cure, let all people do exercises wherever they are, the government spends 40 percent of its annual budget in health," she disclosed.</p>
      <p>She emphasized citizens should use commuter buses for early morning routes from their residences to training centers, instead of using private cars to do away with traffic jam.</p>
      <p>The sports for health care campaign’s netball coordinator, Chantal Mishako, said the sports for health care campaign will be hosted on regular basis.</p>
      <p>The event, she disclosed, is set to be part of the Uhuru torch race’s slogan, given the event is organized by the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>
