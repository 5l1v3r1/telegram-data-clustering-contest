      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> Galaxy Fold included only one large display. Well, according to new <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1197516569787523072?s=20">information</a> its successor may include two displays. Max Weinbach shared some information via Twitter, which reveals that the Galaxy Fold 2 will include a small secondary, cover display.</p>
      <p>Mr. Weinbach has discovered such information in the System UI from the Galaxy Note 9 One UI beta build. The info is connected to the codename 'Bloom', which stands for the Galaxy Fold 2 in Samsung.</p>
      <p>The charging animations are tagged as 'bloom_front', which suggests a front-facing secondary panel for the Galaxy Fold 2. You can check out one of the charging animation via <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/share/TB7atr">this link</a>.</p>

      <h3>The secondary display on the Galaxy Fold 2 will feature rounded corners</h3>
      <p>That small, secondary display will have rounded corners. It will be pill-shaped, it seems. It will be able to offer various different animations, probably.</p>
      <p>Now, on top of this secondary display information, the source also confirmed that the Galaxy Fold 2 will support Super Fast Charging. In other words, the device will support at least 25W wired charging.</p>
      <p>Samsung actually <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/samsung-folding-flip-phone-tease-sdc-2019.html">teased</a> the arrival of the Galaxy Fold 2 during this year's Samsung Developer Conference. That conference took place at the end of last month, and the company more or less confirmed the phone's design.</p>

      <p>Renders that Samsung showed off clearly indicated that the Galaxy Fold 2 will be a vertically-folding smartphone. In that respect, it will be similar to the Motorola Razr.</p>
      <p>Do note that the company never said "this is the Galaxy Fold 2", or anything of the sort. Those renders could just be a proof of concept or something of the sort.</p>
      <p>If those renders are somewhat accurate, the phone will include a display camera hole at the top of the display, and thin bezels all around. It will not offer that unseemly display notch as the original Galaxy Fold.</p>

      <h3>Samsung's second-gen foldable will hopefully be less fragile</h3>
      <p>It seems like the device will fold right down the middle. We still don't have any information regarding its hinge or anything else, but Samsung hopefully made some improvements compared to the Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>You have to be really careful while using the Galaxy Fold, mainly due to its fragile displays. The Motorola Razr, on the other hand, does not seem as fragile, nor did Motorola said you need to baby it.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 is expected to arrive next year. The phone may arrive alongside the Galaxy S11 in February, as the Galaxy Fold did with the Galaxy S10. Samsung may opt to introduce this phone during a separate event, though, we'll see.</p>
