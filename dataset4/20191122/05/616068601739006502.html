      <p>If the cold weather is coating your car with frost that can only come off from scraping, imagine what it does to someone who doesn't have a home. Homeless shelters are usually packed full even during the warmer months, so when winter rolls around, space is very limited and hard to come by.</p>
      <p>Turning Points Collaborative Society in Vernon runs three shelters around the city, and they are opening up some extra spots for the winter season.</p>
      <p>"We are opening up a 20-bed winter shelter today to provide cover from the cold," says Randene Wejr, the co-executive director of the Society. "We expect the spaces to fill up very quickly."</p>
      <p>For the Upper Room Mission, they provide other things for the homeless population.</p>
      <p>"During cold snaps like these we offer things like blankets and winter boots, when we have them," says Naomi Rouck, the general manager at the Mission. "The community has really stepped up year after year to donate warm-clothing items for those who don't have the means to get them on their own."</p>
      <p>Weather forecasts are showing temperatures steadily dropping below freezing at night starting on Sunday. During the day, temperatures will be at freezing or below for the foreseeable future starting Tuesday.</p>
