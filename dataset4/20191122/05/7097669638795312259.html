      <p>A former FBI lawyer is being criminally investigated over an altered document related to the 2016 Russia investigation, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/fbi-fisa-russia-investigation/index.html">CNN reported</a> Thursday, citing people briefed on the matter.</p>
      <p>The allegations are reportedly being levied by the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who is expected to release a report on December 9 reviewing the FBI's actions during the Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>The document in question is associated with the court-approved surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, sources told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/inspector-generals-report-on-fbis-russia-probe-to-be-delivered-dec-9/2019/11/21/6d6d789e-0c70-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html#comments-wrapper">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
      <p>The news of the allegation comes amid the public impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>It is unclear which document was thought to be altered by the FBI lawyer, nor what changes were made or whether the document had any impact on the Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>The allegation against the ex-FBI employee is included in Horowitz's hotly anticipated report, which will "examine whether the FBI violated surveillance laws or policies by obtaining a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant" to investigate Page, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/fbi-trump-russia-probe-inspector-general-report-072433">according to Politico</a>.</p>
      <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a loyal ally to Trump, said Horowitz was expected to appear before lawmakers to testify on December 11, The Post reported.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to reviewing the report and hearing Mr. Horowitz's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he will deliver a detailed account of what he found regarding his investigation, along with recommendations as to how to make our judicial and investigative systems better," Graham said in a statement to Politico.</p>
      <p>A representative from the Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment.</p>
