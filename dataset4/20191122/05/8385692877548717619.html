      <p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">great deal</a> on the Ring Video Doorbell 2 right now, which includes the Echo Show 5. Bringing the price of this bundle down to just $139.</p>
      <p>Now for reference, the Ring Video Doorbell 2 is normally $199 by itself. So you're saving $60 and getting an Echo Show 5 out of the deal. That's not a bad deal at all.</p>
      <p>The Ring Video Doorbell 2 is going to allow you to see everyone that comes to your door, even if they don't want you to know they are there. Ring will alert you through the app. From there, you can talk to the person, or just watch and see what they do. The alerts also come up on Echo devices like the Echo Show 5, hence the deal.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>And with the Echo Show 5 having a display, it makes it easier to actually see what's going on outside of your home. The Ring Video Doorbell 2 is a really good way to keep an eye on any packages that are being delivered to your home. Since it is that time of the year and there are plenty of package thieves out there.</p>
      <p>The Echo Show 5 is basically an Echo with a display. So when you ask Alexa for different things, you can also see the results. Take the weather for example, when you ask for the weather, Alexa will tell you the highs and lows for the day. But you can also see that information, as well as the conditions and what the weather will be for the next few days. That is a very helpful feature.</p>
      <p>This also works for your Daily Briefing, so you are able to actually see the news, instead of just hearing it.</p>
