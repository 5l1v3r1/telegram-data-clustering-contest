      <p>A federal judge on Thursday rejected a U.S. government effort to disqualify lawyers representing state attorneys general in their effort to block T-Mobile US' deal to buy Sprint Corp</p>
      <p>NEW YORK: A federal judge on Thursday rejected a U.S. government effort to disqualify a lawyer representing 15 states and the District of Columbia in their effort to block T-Mobile US' deal to buy Sprint Corp.</p>
      <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger said the Department of Justice waited too long to seek the disqualification of Glenn Pomerantz, who had represented the department in 2011 when it stopped AT&amp;T's purchase of T-Mobile. He also said Pomerantz's firm, Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson LLP, could stay on the case.</p>

      <p>The decision was made in a hearing before a Dec. 9 trial to determine whether T-Mobile, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, may go forward with its planned US$26.5 billion merger with smaller rival Sprint Corp , the fourth-largest wireless carrier.</p>
      <p>State attorneys general from 15 states and the District of Columbia argue that the deal will lead to higher prices for consumers, particularly poorer ones.</p>
      <p>Lehrburger said the Justice Department knew in mid-April about Pomerantz's role and should not have waited until a few weeks before the scheduled trial - and after the originally scheduled October trial date - to speak up.</p>
      <p>"The division's application is untimely," the Manhattan judge said, referring to the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. "The division could have and should have moved much earlier."</p>
