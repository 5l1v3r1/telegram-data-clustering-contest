      <p>Jessica Jewels will celebrate her birthday a little differently this Saturday, and she’s inviting the public to join her.</p>
      <p>The Lake Country resident is raising funds for a Kenya missions trip, where she will help underprivileged children at the House of Hope Orphanage affected by recent flooding. </p>
      <p>Jewels, an <a href="https://www.isagenix.com/en-CA/">Isagenix</a> athlete, is partnering with its charitable foundation<a href="https://www.isafoundation.net/"> The ISA Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.servone.org/">SERV International</a> for the trip, which departs Canada at the end of the month. </p>
      <p>This Saturday, she’ll spend her birthday evening at Dakoda’s Bar and Grill for the ’Stand up for Kenya’ show, and hopes residents of Kelowna will turn up to show their support while enjoying a laugh or two. </p>
      <p>It’s the first time Jewels has gone on a trip of this kind, where she’ll be providing healthy nutrition and support for children, helping orphanage staff and providing aid in wake of the flooding disaster.</p>
      <p>She says she’s most looking forward to having the chance to be on the ground and do something tangible to make a difference for children and families in need. </p>
      <p>"I have always loved helping others and making a difference wherever I go. I love showing my children the importance of being the difference in this world by being yourself and making change happen. I have travelled globally and know the difference kindness and support truly makes.</p>
      <p>"We will be able to see the area for the new greenhouse that the ISA Foundation has provided, as well as give nutritious food to people in Northwest Kenya. Ending this trip, we will be doing a safari in Masai Mara. I will be updating along the way and sharing as much as I possibly can.”</p>
      <p>The comedy fundraiser starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday. </p>
      <p>All proceeds from ticket sales will go towards her trip, including money raised through silent auction items. Tables can be reserved by calling Dakoda’s at 250 860 9500.  Jewels has also set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/rce9z-kenya-service-trip">GoFundMe page</a> to raise support for her trip.</p>
