      <p>Boots shoppers were left devastated last month when they noticed the retailer was no longer offering its 3-for-2 deal on Christmas presents.</p>
      <p>But it looks like the retailer has changed its mind as the deal is now back with shoppers also able to get an extra 10% off when they spend £50 or more online.</p>
      <p>The annual sale, which includes gift sets from brands such as Ted Baker, Yankee Candle, Soap and Glory and more, allows you to pick up the cheapest item for free in stores and online throughout the festive season, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/boots-finally-brings-back-3-20919586">MirrorOnline.</a></p>
      <p>The extra 10% offer is running until Wednesday, November 27.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Boots said: "Every year we aim to offer better savings for our customers throughout the festive period.</p>
      <p>We aim to improve our savings throughout the festive period every year.</p>
      <p>"Our customers tell us how much they value 3 for 2 when they have lots of gifts to buy, however, we know not all of our customers want or need to buy 3 gifts, so, this year we’re introducing new and different ways to help all our customers get great value at Boots, whatever their budget.</p>
      <p>"Customers can expect to see either 3 for 2 or save 25% discount offers go live on amazing giftsets in the run up to Christmas, and don’t forget our unmissable Big Deals which are available until stocks last.</p>
