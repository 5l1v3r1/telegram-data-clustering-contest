      <p>In a tragic twist,  Form 4 student at Nyamauru High School in Mutare, who had just finished writing her “O” Level exams died on her way home after she was struck by a bolt of lightning which burnt through her clothes and left her with fatal burns.</p>
      <p>Dangamvura residents were pained by the untimely death of the 16-year-old Paidamoyo Murepa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manicapost.co.zw/lightning-kills-student-after-exams/">She died instantly after sustaining severe burns</a> on her stomach and was coming from school after finishing writing her final Ordinary Level exam.</p>
      <aside>“Paidamoyo was coming from school at around 5pm. It was raining. She was struck by a lightning bolt and fell on the ground. She had severe burns on her stomach. Memory Sithole (55) saw her lying on the ground and reported the matter to Dangamvura Police Station. Her body was taken to Mutare Provincial Hospital,” said Manicaland deputy provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Luxson Chananda.</aside>
      <p>Her father said the death was a huge loss to the family.</p>
      <aside>“I am still in shock. This is the saddest moment of my life. I was coming from Birchenough Bridge when she called me and told me that she was happy that she had completed her Ordinary Level exams. She was in a jovial mood and she instructed me to buy some okra for her. Before I reached home I received a call from a family member who broke the sad news that she was dead,” he said.</aside>
