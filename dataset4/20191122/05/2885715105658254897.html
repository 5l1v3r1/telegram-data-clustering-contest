      <p>Welcoming the efforts of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has partnered with Piramal Foundation to set up a tribal health collaborative, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) said improving indicators of health among tribal communities will need special focus and tailored interventions.</p>
      <p>The collaborative will work with the centre towards achieving Universal Health Coverage that will focus on improving the health and nutrition in high-burden and tribal districts in the country, an official statement issued here said.</p>
      <p>The average maternal mortality rate in India is 130 deaths per 100,000 births, while tribal communities average 230 deaths per 100,000 births. Similarly, other health indicators such as infant mortality, child malnutrition rates, and incidence of malaria and tuberculosis are much higher among tribal communities than the general population.</p>
      <p>The setting up of such a collaborative is towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 by 2030 on ensuring healthy lives, said Ajay Piramal, founder of Piramal Foundation, in a statement.</p>
      <p>The focus is on addressing the needs of marginalised sections of society, particularly tribal communities, covering a population of more than 150 million across several districts including Aspirational Districts in Central, Eastern, and North-Eastern India, he said. India’s tribal population has poor health indicators when compared to the general population.</p>
      <p>The Piramal Foundation has been working with underserved tribal communities in areas including 25 aspirational districts. Joining hands with the Gates Foundation and working with the Centre will help facilitate the implementation of key public health interventions in partnership with government functionaries across all levels, the statement added.</p>
