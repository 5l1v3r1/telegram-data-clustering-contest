      <h1>MSC year nine student Tayla Simpson completes work experience at The Moree Champion</h1>

      <p>Over this past week I have been fortunate enough to complete my work experience at <i>The Moree Champion.</i></p>
      <p>On Monday, November 18 I began my first day of work experience here and I have enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
      <p>I came here because I wanted to experience what it is like to be a journalist and the different paths you can take in journalism.</p>
      <p>However, whilst I've been here not only have I learnt that but so much more.</p>
      <p>During my time at <i>The Moree Champion </i>I have worked very closely with the amazing senior journalist Sophie Harris. I am so grateful for all that she has taught me; it has been an unforgettable experience that I will always cherish.</p>
      <p>Whilst being here I have learnt so many new and interesting things such as how to write a story in the format that journalists use, how to copyfit a story, what interviewing a person looks like and the general role of a journalist.</p>
      <p>Not only have I learnt the job of a journalist, but I have also been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of all of the other behind-the-scenes parts of a newspaper including how they book and lay out the advertisements and how it all comes together.</p>
      <p>The highlight of my week at <i>The Moree Champion </i>definitely would have to be when we would go interview people or go out and attend events, for example <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6504157/woolworths-moree-celebrates-20th-birthday-with-special-morning-tea/?cs=2772">Woolworth's 20<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations</a>, so that we could write stories on them.</p>
      <p>Another major highlight would have to be when I came up with my own ideas for stories - such as <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6503574/fundraising-continues-for-ancient-history-europe-excursion/?cs=1483">MSC's ancient history Europe excursion fundraiser</a> - and then I got to bring them to life.</p>

      <p>After this incredible week I definitely believe being a journalist is something that I am highly interested in, because I just really enjoy it.</p>
      <p>It is just so fun, interesting, exciting and you never know what the next day will bring which is what I love most.</p>
