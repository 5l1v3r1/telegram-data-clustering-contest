      <h1>England are grateful to their all round talents Sam Curran and Ben Stokes for keeping New Zealand under pressure on Day Two</h1>
      <h2>Curran delivered with the ball in a big way to remove the New Zealand skipper</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:33:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:33</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Wilson, https://www.facebook.com/DeanWilsonCricketMirror/</a></address>
      <p>England were beaming at the all round skills of Sam Curran and Ben Stokes that kept them on top on another arm wrestle of a day at the Bay Oval.</p>
      <p>Curran flopped first ball with the bat, but proved his worth with two wickets including the crucial scalp of skipper Kane Williamson for 51.</p>
      <p>Stokes top scored with the bat in making 91 before England suffered an all too familiar mini collapse on their way to 353 all out.</p>
      <p>And he was back in the thick of the action with the ball when he had Ross Taylor caught in the deep to break an ominous partnership between the Blackcaps two most senior batsmen.</p>

      <p>The efforts of Curran and Stokes, with a little help from Jack Leach, meant that New Zealand closed day two on 144-4, still 209 behind England's first innings score.</p>
      <p>And while the pitch remains more helpful for batsmen than bowlers, the sight of Curran surprising Williamson with one that bounced more than expected to take the gloves and loop to Stokes at second slip suggests things will only get tougher.</p>
      <p>And there was obvious concern when Jofra Archer, who went wicketless, clunked Henry Nicholls on the back of his helmet late in the day with a quick short-pitched delivery before he batted on.</p>
      <p>After beating Chris Woakes to a place in the team Curran showed his obvious delight at removing the Tauranga-born Williamson who had only just moved to his fifty and would have wanted nothing more than to be the first Test century maker at his home ground.</p>

      <p>Curran had earlier removed Tom Latham lbw with his third ball of the match, trapping him lbw for eight although had he reviewed it an inside edge would have saved him.</p>
      <p>Leach's dismissal of Jeet Raval was little more than a gift as he tried to slog sweep the spinner too many times and was caught by Joe Denly at a deepish mid-wicket.</p>
      <p>All this after Stokes had come within just nine runs of a ninth Test hundred but was stopped in his tracks by a stunning one handed catch at slip by Taylor.</p>

      <p>Tim Southee had his tail up as a result and was able to tempt Ollie Pope into a rash drive at a wide one on 29 and the very next ball had Curran lbw.</p>
      <p>If it wasn't for Jos Buttler's partnership of 52 with the increasingly reliable Leach, England could have even fallen short of 300 when they had been eyeing a total beginning with a four.</p>
      <p>Buttler was eventually removed for 43, caught on the point boundary, although Mitchell Santner had to vault the advertising hoardings where he had been signing autographs to make it back on the field before the ball was bowled.</p>
      <p>There was no protest from Buttler who presumably knew there was a fielder there having hit the ball in that direction beforehand.</p>
