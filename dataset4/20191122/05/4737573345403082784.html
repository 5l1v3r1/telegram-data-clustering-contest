      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An undergrounding project has been completed on a scenic stretch of Taitung County Route 197 from Chihshang Township to Taitung City to remove the eyesore of omnipresent overhead cables and utility poles, CNA reported on Thursday (Nov. 21).</p>
      <p>According to the Chihshang Township Office, the undergrounding project on the first 2-kilometer stretch of Taitung County Route 197, which cost NT$60 million (US$1.88 million) to complete, has created a landscape of a straight rural highway going through vast paddy fields, with mountains in the background and no utility poles in sight.</p>
      <p>The office went on to say that it took one year to complete the road beautifying project, which involved changing tape-water pipes and moving power lines, telecommunication cables, and manholes underground, the news agency reported.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the completion of the project, the office has invited members of the public to participate in a hiking activity on Sunday (Nov. 24) to experience the magnificent scenery free of utility poles, the report said.</p>
      <p>In the past, few tourists would bike on the country road. However, now the 2-kilometer stretch is frequented by photo op-seeking tourists, and some of them even mistake it as Chihshang Township's famous Mr. Brown Avenue, according to the news agency.</p>
