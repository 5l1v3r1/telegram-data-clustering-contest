      <p>However, there is no place for Tanzania’s national team ‘Taifa Stars’ skipper Mbwana Samatta, who has scored 19 goals and grabbed six assists across all competitions for club and country so far in 2019.</p>
      <p>Samatta could hardly have enjoyed a better 2019 year. He fired Genk to Belgium’s Jupiler League title and won the Ebony Shoe for his efforts, an award given to the best African or player of African origin in the Belgian top-flight. He also helped Tanzania qualify for the AFCON finals for the first time in 39 years.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old striker and 2015 best African player based in Africa has hit eight goals in 19 games this season as well as 32 goals in 51 appearances last term to attract interest from English Premier League clubs.</p>
      <p>Uganda captain Dennis Onyango, who plays for Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa, and Kenya’s skipper Victor Wanyama, who plies his trade in Belgium, are the only East African players on the list.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) champions Algeria dominate the list with a total of 10 players amongst the full list of 55 players.</p>
      <p>The final team will be announced on January 7, 2020 at the CAF headquarters in Cairo at the annual awards ceremony.</p>
