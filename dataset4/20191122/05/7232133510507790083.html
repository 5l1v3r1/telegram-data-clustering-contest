        <i>Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market cap tumbling with a strong bearish angle. BNB, TRX are recovering, while <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/ethereum-eth-hits-final-bearish-target-whats-next/">Ethereum</a> (ETH), litecoin, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/ripple-xrp-price-trend-overwhelmingly-negative-bitcoin-dives-to-7-5k/">ripple</a>, BCH, XLM, and EOS down more than 5%.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, BCH price followed a bearish path below the $265 support against the US Dollar. BCH even failed to hold the $235 support and recently declined more than 8%. It is now trading near the $220 support, below which there is a risk of more losses towards the $205 level.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $235 level. However, the main hurdle is now near the $250 level for the bulls.</p>
      <h3>Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Binance coin (BNB) started a nasty decline after it settled below the $20.00 support area. BNB price broke many supports such as $18.50 and $17.80. BNB price is now trading near the $17.00 level and it seems like it could test the $16.20 support in the near term.</p>
      <p>Litecoin price is down more than 8% and it traded below the $52.50 and $51.20 support levels. LTC price even spiked below $50.00 and it is now consolidating above the $50.00 level. On the upside, the previous support near $51.20 may perhaps act as a resistance.</p>
      <p>Tron price is also under a lot of selling pressure and it broke the key $0.0165 support area. TRX price is now trading near the $0.0152 support and it might soon test the $0.0150 support area. On the upside, the $0.0162 and $0.0165 levels are now important resistances.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Looking at the total cryptocurrency market cap 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-TOTAL/">chart</a>, there was a sharp decline below the $210.0B support area. The market cap even broke the $200.0B support area (yesterday’s bearish target). It seems like there are chances of more downsides towards the $185.0B and $180.0B support levels in the near term.</p>
      <p>Therefore, upsides are likely to be capped in bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, litecoin, ripple, binance coin, BCH, TRX, XMR, XLM and other altcoins in the near term.</p>
