      <p>The Deputy Minister for Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Paul Essien has said the statement being attributed to his boss about a decision to build a national shrine is false.</p>
      <p>It will be recalled that the honourable minister for Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Mr. Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, at the meet the press series on Wednesday 20th November 2019 reportedly declared plans his ministry had with to construct a national shrine to match the construction of a national Cathedral.</p>
      <p>However, speaking on Atinka FM’s AM Drive with popular host Ekourba Gyasi, the Deputy Minister for Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Paul Essien stated that his boss was misquoted and that he did not state emphatically that the Ministry was putting measures in place to build a national shrine.</p>
      <p>“During question and answers section with the media, Mr. Samuel Kofi Dzamesi was asked if the ministry was considering building a national shrine for Traditional rulers since the ministry is already building a national cathedral for Christians, the Minister responded that it is the duty of the Ministry to ensure that one religion is not elevated than the other and that should the Traditional rulers come together to demand a national shrine the Ministry will look into it and facilitate”, he told Atinka FM’s listeners.</p>
      <p>According to him, this did not in anyway mean there was going to a National Shrine sponsored by government as was widely reported.</p>
