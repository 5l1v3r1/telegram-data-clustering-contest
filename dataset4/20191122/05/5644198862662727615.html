      <p>A Chinese antitrust regulator has approved Boeing Co's deal to buy a controlling stake in the commercial jet division of Brazilian planemaker Embraer , according to a statement on the regulator's website.</p>
      <p>BRASILIA: A Chinese antitrust regulator has approved Boeing Co's deal to buy a controlling stake in the commercial jet division of Brazilian planemaker Embraer , according to a statement on the regulator's website.</p>
      <p>The Boeing-Embraer deal appears on a list dated Nov. 19 of transactions "approved unconditionally" that is posted to the website of the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation's anti-monopoly department.</p>

      <p>The document gives no further details, only saying that the case was adjudicated 10 days earlier on Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, has been seeking to finalize its purchase of 80per cent of Embraer's commercial jet division in a bid to compete with Europe's Airbus in the market for planes with fewer than 150 seats.</p>
      <p>China's approval comes as EU regulators have delayed a decision until both companies provide additional documents, which Embraer has said it is trying to do as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The companies originally said they expected to close the deal this year.</p>
