      <h1>China's J-20 Stealth Fighter Has One Big Advantage over the F-35</h1>
      <h2>Two words: missile range.  </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Episkopos</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> Beijing's fighter might not be as advanced, but its missiles can shoot farther than America's can.</p>
      <p>The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force made waves at the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow with<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2172993/china-reveals-j-20-stealth-fighters-missile-carrying-capability"> the latest showing</a> of their flagship fifth-generation stealth fighter, the J-20.</p>
      <p>As is common with airshow coverage, large swaths of the ensuing commentary focused on the J-20’s handling and maneuverability as it performed a series of rolls and a climb. But this elides what is perhaps the most significant aspect of the J-20’s Zhuhai showing: its weapons system.</p>
      <p>During the performance, the J-20 opened its missile bay doors to reveal four PL-15 missiles accompanied by two PL-10 missiles on either side. The PL-15 is a long range air-to-air missile slated to enter service in 2018. Outfitted with an active electronically scanned radar and featuring a reported maximum range of up to 300 km, the PL-15’s impressive specifications<a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/print/volume-27/issue-5/news/trends/can-u-s-air-to-air-missiles-stand-up-to-modern-enemy-electronic-warfare.html"> place it in the ranks</a> of the top air-to-air missiles along with the European Meteor missile and Russian K-37M.</p>
      <p>The PL-15’s effective range in actual aerial engagements is certain to be lower than the maximum range 300 km, but is nonetheless much higher than its American AIM-120 AMRAAM counterpart’s estimated 180 km or less. American general Herbert Carlisle<a href="https://www.csis.org/events/military-strategy-forum-general-herbert-hawk-carlisle-air-combat-command-todays-conflicts-and"> voiced serious concerns</a> in 2015 when the development of the PL-15 entered the public knowledge: “Look at our adversaries and what they’re developing, things like the PL-15 and the range of that weapon.” General Carlisle<a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-seeks-interim-champ-longer-range-air-to-air-416828/"> raised the same</a> issue in an interview with FlightGlobal: “The PL-15 and the range of that missile, we’ve got to be able to out-stick that missile.”</p>
      <p>The American<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/air-force-f-22-has-two-new-weapons-heres-what-they-can-do-33481"> F-22</a> and F-35 fighters are now equipped with the latest AIM 120-D missiles, but a massive range deficit remains nonetheless. The challenge of the PL-15 comes on the heels of questions about the<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/america-close-maxing-out-its-deadly-aim-120-amraam-missile-16223"> uncertain future</a> of the aging AMRAAM system. As Captain James Stoneman put it to the <i>National Interest</i>: “Currently there is no program of record for a follow-on… we’ve probably close to maxing it out.” Development of the latest Block III iteration of the short range AIM-9X was<a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/f-35-fires-aim-9x-as-raytheon-snags-next-gen-weapons-421133/"> cancelled</a>, and Raytheon<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/smr/2017/07/27/dod-slashes-amraam-missile-buy-as-raytheon-struggles-with-tech-refresh/"> struggles</a> with a necessary AMRAAM refresh.</p>
      <p>The J-20’s two side-mounted PL-10 missiles, while less conspicuous than their long range counterpart, are a key factor in the J-20’s operational versatility. A short-range infrared air-to-air missile, the PL-10 can be fired at off boresight angles of 90 degrees using the J-20’s Helmet Mounted Display (HMD). In other words, the PL-10’s on the J-20 can be fired in the direction that the pilot points their head.</p>
      <p>Off boresight targeting is<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/air-war-air-force-f-15c-vs-russias-deadly-su-57-who-wins-26344"> by no means a new technology</a>. In fact, the PL-10 is China’s response to the AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder short range missiles that the United States is<a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3329281"> selling to Taiwan</a>. There is no reliable information on the PL-10’s range at the time of writing, but it is expected to at least match AIM-9X’s reported maximum range of 20-22 km. Iterative performance differences aside, it is a bigger long-term concern is that the PL-10 and PL-15 are reportedly built with the latest anti-jamming technology at a time when the AIM- 9X and AIM-120D are perceived as<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-militarys-top-guns-the-air-have-big-weakness-14065"> increasingly vulnerable</a> to modern digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jamming techniques.</p>
      <p>There is much that is still unknown about the J-20, including its launch mechanism and the final specifications of its WS-15 engine currently in development. It remains to be seen if this particular armament configuration makes it into the regular production process, but the juxtaposition of the PL-15 and PL-10 inside the J-20’s frame can become a stark concern for the United States and some of its regional allies who continue to rely on aging AMRAAM technology.</p>
