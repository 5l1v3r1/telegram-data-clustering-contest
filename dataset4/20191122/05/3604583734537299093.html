      <h1>Coffee shop talk in 4EK campaign this weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:57:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:57</time> by <a rel="author">Melanie Whelan</a></address>
      <p>FREE small coffees have become a major talking point on the Western Freeway in Leigh Creek this week. So too, have the cheap larger-sized hot beverages.</p>
      <p>Baristas at 143 Degrees East say when customers question the promotion, it allows a chance to talk about 4EK.</p>
      <p>The roadside cafe has been asking for donations to the 4EK foundation, which raises awareness and money to support families affected by meningococcal nationwide. The foundation does so in memory of <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/4993421/helping-to-make-sense-of-emma-kates-senseless-passing/">Ballarat teenager Emma-Kate McGrath</a>, who died from meningococcal septicaemia strain W more than two years ago in what was her first year of nursing studies.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Coffee consumers had donated about $900 leading into the weekend, plus a single $500 online donation to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Cafe staff have fliers on hand to help spread the 4EK message.</p>
      <p>Globally, there are 13 strains of meningococcal with five strains mainly responsible for cases in Australia. Young people are most likely to spread the bacterial disease to each other and everyone is urged to check with their doctors for vaccination.</p>
      <p>Baristas at 143 Degrees East will be rattling 4EK tins all Saturday and Sunday.</p>
