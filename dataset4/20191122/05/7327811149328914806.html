      <h1>GM recalls 640,000 pickup trucks over possible carpet fires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:27:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:27</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p>General Motors is recalling over 640,000 pickup trucks worldwide because hot gas from a high-tech seat belt can set the carpeting on fire.</p>
      <p>The recall covers certain 2019 and 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500 trucks. Also included are some 2020 Silverado and Sierra 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty pickups. All have carpet as a floor covering, and most are in North America.</p>
      <p>GM says it uses a small explosion to move a piston that tightens the belts before a crash. The explosion can release hot gas through an opening in a bracket, possibly setting the carpet on fire. The company reports two fires but no injuries.</p>
      <p>Dealers will close the opening at no cost to owners. No date was given for the recall to start.</p>
