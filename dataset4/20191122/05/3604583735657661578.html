      <h3>Despite problem times, MaxiTRANS remains important to BallaratÂ employment</h3>
      <p>Over the past 2 years MaxiTRANS in Ballarat would have offered over 100 short to medium term casual jobs to people in the Ballarat community.</p>
      <p>Because these opportunities are casual, people with extensive experience that are in work do not consider them, this means these opportunities are filled either by people that are out of work or by people that lack the experience to gain a full time ongoing job.</p>
      <p>Thanks to MaxiTRANS people new to Ballarat that need work quickly or people who have lost their job at short notice are able to gain work quickly because "Maxi is always hiring", this offers them a medium term solution while they work out there long term future.</p>
      <p>MaxiTRANS also does a wonderful job breaking down roles into high a low skilled, allowing them to hire younger people, that are really struggling to 'get a go'.</p>
      <p>Thanks to MaxiTRANS they get that opportunity, build some skills that open them up to more opportunities as they get their career started.</p>

      <p>Large manufacturers like MaxiTRANS are required to respond to the needs of their customers, these needs can fluctuate considerably and unpredictably.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this means they rely on a flexible workforce, which sucks for those that have lost their jobs recently but let's not forget the significant opportunities MaxiTRANS offers people in our community.</p>
      <p>We are lucky they are in Ballarat and should all hope to see them bounce back with a big start to 2020, it will be the people of Ballarat that will benefit the most.</p>
