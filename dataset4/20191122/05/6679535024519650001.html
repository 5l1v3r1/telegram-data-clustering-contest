      <p>Lok Sabha | 1:00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, INC, speaks on the need for climate justice. "Why shoul common people be the victims of the lackadaisical and cavalier approach of the government?" he asks. "We need a climate smart economy". It is an extremely profitable type of economy, he says, citing an environmentalist.</p>
      <p>He commends the efforts of Sweden's Greta Thunberg.</p>
      <p>Cimate change was not even mentioned once in the budget speeches of the NDA over the last couple of years, Mr. Chowdhury alleges.</p>

      <p>He expands on the difference between climate change and air pollution.</p>
      <p>He talks about the four undertakings in the Paris Climate accord. One of them is to include 40% of renewable energy in the country's energy mix so as to cut down on coal. This will be achieved by or even before 2030, he says.</p>
