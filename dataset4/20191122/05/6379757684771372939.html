      <p>The likes of Mbwana Samatta and, more recently, Kelvin John, made their statements as fresh-faced teenagers, tearing defences apart from an early age and never looking back in the senior national team ‘Taifa Stars’.</p>
      <p>Samatta made his senior national team debut at 18 years while John earned his Taifa Stars cap at 16 years, both achieving that feat after impressive outings with the junior national teams.</p>
      <p>However, for majority of Tanzanian players, they have to wait till when they are into their mid-20s to don the senior national team jersey. That is the case for Ditram Nchimbi.</p>
      <p>Nchimbi has made a remarkable turnaround after having originally been considered a flop.</p>
      <p>He is now in his fifth Tanzania Premier League Club after not so successful stints at Mbeya City FC, Njombe Mji FC, Mwadui and Azam FC.</p>
      <p>It was at Azam FC where he struggling to truly show just what he could be considered a top striker.</p>
      <p>Azam FC signed him for two years but deemed him surplus to requirement. He made not more than three appearances before being loaned out to Mwadui where he formed a good partnership with Salim Aiyee.</p>
      <p>Despite his good outing with Mwadui he was still considered not good enough for Azam FC and was once again loaned out to Police Tanzania for the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Luckily, Nchimbi has managed to establish himself as one of the Vodacom Premier league’s dominant forward.</p>
      <p>He scored a hat-trick against Young Africans ‘Yanga’ which earned him a senior national team call up.</p>
      <p>There was murmur of disapproval but coach Etienne Ndayiragije stuck with his decision.</p>
      <p>Nchimbi who had his fair share of doubters, had a wonderful second half national team debut against Rwanda before he struck a wonderful goal and grabbed an assist against Sudan to announce his arrival in senior national team colours in a grand style.</p>
      <p>It is a goal he will remember all his life but more significantly, it is one that has pressed his claims for the national team centre forward jersey. It was no surprise he was picked as the first substitute against Equatorial Guinea and went on to grab an assist when he set up Salum Abubakar ‘Sure Boy’ sweet winning goal in injury time.</p>
      <p>Things could not have gone much better for the 24-year-old since, with Nchimbi scoring one goal and assisting two in three competitive matches for Taifa Stars.</p>
      <p>Since the decline of Thomas Ulimwengu, Taifa Stars had missed a striker with physicality and movement until the arrival of Nchimbi.</p>
      <p>With Nchimbi in the side, Taifa Stars have a forward who can bother defenders. He is ever chasing balls, vies for the 50-50 aerial balls by using his muscular frame to legally wrestle them.</p>
      <p>His detractors still point to the number of chances he puts to waste, and his lack of hold up against, but strikers are nominally judged on the goals they score. Goals stick in the memory, missed chances fade.</p>
      <p>Nchimbi is already a dead cert for Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) Cameroon 2021 and is increasingly looking like he will figure highly in Ndayiragije’s plans for the rest of this AFCON qualification campaign and the 2022 World Cup qualifiers next year.</p>
      <p>It also helps Nchimbi that he is playing regularly for Police Tanzania at home and Ndayiragije together with his assistants Juma Mgunda and Selemani Matola can easily check his progress.</p>
      <p>Timing is key in sport and, with the injury of John Bocco and the lack of game time for the more talented Shaban Chilunda at Azam  FC, Nchimbi could not have picked a more opportune time to properly announce his arrival after a fledgling career.</p>
