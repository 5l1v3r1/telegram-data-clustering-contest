      <p>Sadio Mane has described Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp as the best manager in the world.</p>
      <p>Liverpool is top of the Premier League and are eight points ahead of second-place Leicester City.</p>
      <p>And Mane, who is Liverpool’s top scorer so far in the league this season with seven goals, has hailed Klopp’s influence.</p>
      <p>‘There are a lot of good managers in Europe but what I can say is that our manager always has the right words and the right things to manage his team, especially knowing how to deal with his team.</p>
      <p>I would always trust his influence on the team. He is a winner and I would say he is the best in the world.’</p>
      <p>Liverpool resume domestic action with a tricky trip to Selhurst Park to play Crystal Palace tomorrow.</p>
