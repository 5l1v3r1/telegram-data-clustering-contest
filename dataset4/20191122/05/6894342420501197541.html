      <h1>Valve Expands Availability Of Index VR Headset; Malaysia Not In The List</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>Hot on the tail of the official <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199970/half-life-alyx-drops-in-march-2020-takes-place-before-half-life-2/">announcement</a> of Half-Life: Alyx, Valve has announced plans to expand the availabily of its <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/185103/valve-index-vr-headset-now-official-features-displays-with-120hz-refresh-rate/">Index VR</a> headset. According to The Verge, the VR headset and its controllers are now available in Canada and Japan. Prior to this, they were only available only in the US and Europe.</p>
      <p>No doubt the company  made this move to promote both products simultaneously. The new Half-Life game will actually not require Valve’s Index. But Ars Technica’s <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199594/valve-confirms-half-life-alyx-on-twitter/">previous report</a> indicates that the experience of the company’s game will likely be more complete with its own VR headset and controllers. All this will mainly be down to the Knuckles controller. But it’s not clear yet what’s the digree of the difference the controller will make.</p>

      <p>As mentioned during the Half-Life: Alyx announcement, those who already own the Valve Index VR headset will get the game for free. Those who get the headset before the end of the year will also get in-game cosmetics.</p>
      <p>But, unfortunately, Malaysia is not part of the new regions where the Valve Index will be available. There’s also no indication as to when, if ever, we’ll ever have it on our shores.</p>
