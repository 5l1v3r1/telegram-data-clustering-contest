      <h1>Shaun Wright-Phillips' comments on Jose Mourinho will excite Tottenham fans</h1>
      <h2>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager was appointed as the new Tottenham head coach on Wednesday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Connor O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips has opened up on what it is like to play under Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager was appointed as the new Tottenham head coach on Wednesday morning after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by the club on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes over a Spurs side that are without a win in their past five games and have slipped to 14th in the Premier League, 20 points behind leaders Liverpool after just 12 matches.</p>
      <p>And Wright-Phillips, who spent three years working under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge, has revealed why he is the best manager he worked under in his playing career.</p>
      <p>“You have to give your all,” the former winger told <a href="https://twitter.com/5livesport/status/1197799516033839105?s=21">BBC Radio Five Live</a> .</p>
      <p>“For me now, he's the best manager I played under. Even though I wasn’t in the team week in week out I still enjoyed being there. I still felt part of the team and I still felt like we all battered in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“I think if he brings that to Spurs and they all put their blood out there for Spurs, then they have a great chance because managers like him don’t come and go that often, and you don’t just lose what you have.”</p>

      <p>While the former England international also believes that a squad shake up at the club is exactly what is needed.</p>
      <p>“For me, I feel like Spurs might need that,” Wright-Phillips replied when asked if any of Spurs’ players will be nervous about their future under Mourinho.</p>
      <p>“I feel like they always get to the final hurdle and just fail, and I think he might be the person to take them across the line.”</p>
