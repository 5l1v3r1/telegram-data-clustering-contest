      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: A worrying rise in men are using the 'sex game gone wrong' defence and dragging up victims' sexual past to justify violent murders, says criminologist Professor Elizabeth Yardley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:01:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A twisted killer who used Grace Millane's sexual history in an attempt to get off scot-free for her murder is the "tip of the iceberg" of a worrying trend, a criminologist has said.</p>
      <p>Professor Elizabeth Yardley has told how an increasing number of men are using the 'sex game gone wrong' defence as a sick excuse for violent killings.</p>
      <p>And she believes the use of victims' sexual history is a devious ploy to deflect attention away from the murderers' actions, including rape.</p>
      <p>"It's easy for the perpetrator to pin their actions on this - as their victim has been silenced," said Prof Yardley, from Birmingham City University.</p>
      <p>Grace, 21, from Wickford, Essex, was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grace-millanes-tinder-date-death-20926706">choked to death</a> during sexual intercourse, before being stuffed inside a suitcase and buried in woodland.</p>

        <figcaption>Grace's killer tried to claim it was an accident and that she spoke of an interest in BDSM</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite the wicked actions, her killer insisted her death was an accident and that the university graduate had asked him to put his hands around her neck.</p>
      <p>In the trial, prosecutor Brian Dickey said: "It’s not safe sex play that killed Grace Millane, it’s strangulation.</p>
      <p>“She must have gone limp and he must have carried on and that must be murder.”</p>
      <p>Grace is the 59th UK woman to be killed by a man in what he claims to be sex - that she requested - gone wrong, according to charity We Can't Consent to This.</p>
      <p>Her 27-year-old killer's murder conviction is a "huge relief" to the people behind the organisation, who followed the trial and work tirelessly to insist there is no 'rough sex' defence to the killing or violent injury of females.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman told the Mirror today: "All of us at We Can't Consent to This are relieved to hear of the murder verdict and hope it may bring small comfort to Grace's family and friends."</p>
      <p>They also condemned women's sexual history being used in court in an attempt by defendants to evade prosecution and blame the victim.</p>
      <p>"Even where these men convicted of murder, they use the women's sexual history against her, their claims repeated in headlines. We must stop blaming women for their own homicides," they said.</p>
      <p>Over the last five years, the 'sex game' or 'rough sex' defence was successful in nine of the 18 killings of a woman which reached trial, with the man being found not guilty or receiving a manslaughter conviction.</p>
      <p>Deaths of these kind have also risen by 90 per cent in the last decade. Two thirds involve strangulation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/25/fatal-hateful-rise-of-choking-during-sex">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

      <p>In 2010, mum-of-two Michelle Stonall, 34, was found strangled with her dog’s lead in Sheldon Country Park, Birmingham.</p>
      <p>David Connors admitted manslaughter, but claimed it was the result of a sex game that had gone wrong.</p>
      <p>Less than two months after that, classroom assistant Anna Banks, 23, from Lancashire, was strangled by her boyfriend of four months.</p>
      <p>Daniel Lancaster, then 25, claimed she “enjoyed being throttled during intercourse”. He was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and given a four-year sentence.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Robert Simpson-Scott, 44, told a court he accidentally strangled his partner of 15 years, Sally Cavender, while she was performing a sex act.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty of murder.</p>

      <p>However, Prof Yardley said many violent deaths during sex do not even see the inside of a courtroom and are instead branded as misadventure.</p>
      <p>And, she highlights, it is only the perpetrators' word that it was even consensual as there is often a lack of proof.</p>
      <p>"Grace's case is a guilty verdict, but I think we need to remember that this is the tip of the iceberg," she said.</p>
      <p>"We are increasingly seeing a lot of homicides with the sex game gone wrong defence.</p>
      <p>"The first assumption is that the woman had a degree of freedom and was able to leave the relationship or say no to sex acts.</p>
      <p>"I am surprised how much weight is being given to the perpetrators' version of events."</p>

      <p>Prof Yardley believes films such as Fifty Shades of Grey, as well as the amble online access to porn, and "appalling" sex-related articles in women's magazines are normalising violence during sex.</p>
      <p>"It is a factor in the background that men are drawing upon," she said.</p>
      <p>"It used to be the nagging and sh*gging defence, where men would say there wives were nagging them and they snapped. But now the sex game gone wrong has emerged in its place.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is exposed to BDSM even if they just mention it to a friend, therefore it makes it seem consensual and this needs challenging."</p>
      <p>Prof Yardley also believes the "traditional" judicial system, with often elderly judges, needs to not be afraid to introduce sex experts in cases of this kind.</p>
      <p>She feels they would be crucial to delve deeper into 'sex game gone wrong' defences.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, speaking of Grace's killer, she condemned him for using her like "throwaway plastic" disposing of her once he got what he wanted.</p>
      <p>"He's clearly somebody who has a sense of entitlement to get what he wants," she said.</p>
