      <p>Volkswagen no longer makes the Scirocco, with production of the third-generation coupé ceasing back in 2017. But that hasn’t stopped a digital artist from dreaming up a new version, complete with <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-volkswagen-golf-8-official-details-and-more-images-revealed/">Golf 8</a> styling cues.</p>
      <p>Brazilian artist <a href="https://www.behance.net/designerklebers">Kleber Silva</a> created the renderings you see here, retaining the general shape of the final Scirocco generation, but updating the details with various design elements inspired by the eighth-generation Golf.</p>
      <p>The approach makes sense, considering the Scirocco has historically borrowed its platform from its mainstream hatchback cousin. Up front, the rendered model features the latest Golf’s headlamp and grille arrangement, while retaining the old Scirocco’s lower grille design and alloy wheels (as used on the GTS).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Silva has left the rear end largely unchanged, tweaking only the lighting signature and moving the “GTS” badge to the centre.</p>
      <p>Of course, if VW does indeed decide to revive the Scirocco nameplate (and that's a pretty big "if"), expect the two-door model to return in electric rather than combustion-engine form, running on the Wolfsburg-based company’s MEB platform.</p>
