      <p>There’s mixed availability for Kaizer Chiefs as they go into their big Telkom Knockout semi-final on Sunday, with the club giving an update on their status today…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/categories/kaizer-chiefs/poll/a-key-figure-at-kaizer-chiefs-has-resigned/667938">Key Chiefs Figure Resigns!</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp already has Daniel Akpeyi, Willard Katsande and Erick Mathoho out of the game with Maritzburg United due to suspension, while South African youth internationals, Happy Mashiane and Siyabonga Ngezana, are also unavailable.</p>
      <p>There is good news though regarding Kearyn Baccus, who is set to return to the squad, while young Nkosingiphile Ngcobo ‘has made steady progress’ following his Achilles injury and could be back in contention in the near future.</p>
      <p>On the club’s official website, they confirmed the return of Baccus, saying, “Making a welcome return from an ankle injury is Kearyn Baccus. The midfield maestro was on fine form before getting injured in Telkom Knockout Cup Round of 16 match against Cape Town City in October.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fans could also see young Ngcobo back in the squad sooner rather than later, with Chiefs adding, “It is a matter of time before we see Nkosingiphile Ngcobo back in contention for his place in the team. The youngster has made steady progress through the Reserves league matches, playing ninety minutes in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge Soweto Derby last Saturday. Ngcobo ruptured his Achilles tendon in March in a game against SuperSport United.”</p>
      <p>The club went on to confirm – although it was recently reported anyway – that both Mashiane and Ngezana have remained with South Africa’s U23s at the African Cup of Nations in Egypt for their encounter with Ghana today.</p>

      <p>Chiefs' young duo will be hoping to return to South Africa as qualifiers for the Olympic Games next year, with a win this afternoon booking their place at Tokyo 2020. </p>
