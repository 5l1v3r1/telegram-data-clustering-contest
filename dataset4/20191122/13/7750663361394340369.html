      <p>The 24-year-old has been with Bayern since 2015, making close 200 appearances for the German giants in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Although primarily a defender, Kimmich has also played in midfield on a number of occasions this season, contributing one goal and five assists in 18 outings in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The Germany international has a contract at the Allianz Arena until the summer of 2023, but according to <i>Mundo Deportivo</i>, Barca are keen to bring him to Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>The report claims that the Spanish club's sporting director <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-abidal/"><b>Eric Abidal</b></a> has identified Kimmich as an ideal signing to boost the squad in next summer's transfer window.</p>
      <p>Barca, who are back in La Liga action away to Leganes on Saturday afternoon, are also allegedly in the market for a new striker and central defender.</p>
