      <p>Between PWHPA games, the Dream Gap Tour and the Rivalry Series, there’s a lot of women’s hockey coming at you in the next few months. To make sure you don’t miss any of it, we’ve combined all the currently scheduled games in Ontario and all the likely-to-be streamed or broadcast games into one convenient list.</p>
      <h3>Watching from home</h3>
      <h4>PWHPA</h4>
      <p>Since nothing has really been announced about streaming for Ontario games, we can’t guarantee much, but if you’re not able to go to any of these games you should check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQAnDykeWDgdasxf7Sm61qg">PWHPA Youtube channel</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/sports/Live%20Streaming">CBC Sports</a> or the <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/">CBC Gem app</a> for PWHPA games - definitely for the Dream Gap tour and maybe for some of the others.</p>
      <p>There has been some mention that some of the PWHPA games in other areas might be streamed, and there are still Dream Gap tourdates yet to be announced, so you also want to keep an eye on the <a href="http://pwhpa.com/events/">PWHPA Events page</a> for those. <b>EDIT: Again, the PWHPA dates included in this list are the Ontario dates only, if you are not in Ontario, there are more PWHPA dates available (some for this upcoming weekend, Nov 22-24) listed on the PWHPA Events page, however this is a Toronto-focused blog and as of last night there were no livestream links pre-posted on Youtube for anything this weekend.</b></p>
      <h4>Hockey Canada</h4>
      <p>Again, nothing has been officially announced regarding broadcast details for the Rivalry Series, but Hockey Canada’s broadcast deal is with <a href="https://www.tsn.ca/live">TSN</a> and <a href="https://www.rds.ca/en-direct">RDS</a> so check them out for those dates, as well as for Women’s Worlds in April. Americans should keep an eye on NBC Sports, the NHL network and <a href="http://HockeyTV.com/">HockeyTV.com</a>.</p>
      <p>If you’re local to Toronto and Kingston some more mini-camps - four day Women’s National Team camps on weekdays that will include some scrimmages - are going to happen but Hockey Canada hasn’t actually publicized those yet. Information will be available <a href="https://hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/team-canada/women/national/2019-20/mini-camps/schedule">here</a> or through the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/HC_Women">@HC_Women</a> twitter account</p>
      <h4>U-18 Worlds</h4>
      <p>Streaming is touch and go on this tournament and having it scheduled at the exact same time as the men’s U-20 tournament (World Juniors) doesn’t help. If there are streams, they’re likely to be linked from the <a href="https://www.iihf.com/en/events/2020/ww18">IIHF.com</a> site.</p>
