      <p>Sony’s official PlayStation Store Black Friday deals are looking pretty good, with FIFA 20 for £40 and Borderlands 3 for £35.</p>
      <p>By next year it’s probably going to be called Black November, not Black Friday, so it’ll come as no surprise to find that Sony’s Black Friday PlayStation deals have already started.</p>
      <p>The full list of deals is available via the <a href="https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2019/11/22/playstation-stores-black-friday-discounts-start-today-save-on-games-ps-plus-and-movies/">PlayStation Blog</a>, but amongst the most tempting are <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0006-CUSA15545_00-FIFAFOOTBALL2020">FIFA 20</a> for just £39.99, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1001-CUSA16386_00-NBA2K20000000000">NBA 2K20</a> for £29.99, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA11995_00-MARVELSSPIDERMAN">Marvel’s Spider-Man</a> for £15.99, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1004-CUSA00411_00-PREMIUMPACKOG001">GTA V Premium Online Edition</a> for just £7.99.</p>
