      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-stubbs/"><b>Sam Stubbs</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/scott-martin/"><b>Scott Martin</b></a> are both suspended for the showdown with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steven-gerrard/"><b>Steven Gerrard</b></a>'s team while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/blair-alston/"><b>Blair Alston</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ciaran-mckenna/"><b>Ciaran McKenna</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-fulton/"><b>Ryan Fulton</b></a> (all knee) and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-mcgowan/"><b>Aaron McGowan</b></a> (hamstring) are all definitely missing too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brian-easton/"><b>Brian Easton</b></a> (thigh) and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marios-ogkmpoe/"><b>Marios Ogkmpoe</b></a> (ankle) are also doubts, meaning Rice may be forced to hand out-of-favour club captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/darian-mackinnon/"><b>Darian Mackinnon</b></a> his first start since August.</p>
      <p>Rangers boss Steven Gerrard has the luxury of a near fully-fit squad to choose from.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jordan-jones/"><b>Jordan Jones</b></a> has returned to full training after an 11-week absence resulting from the knee injury he picked up in September's Old Firm defeat, although he is still 10-days away from being ready for first-team action.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alfredo-morelos/"><b>Alfredo Morelos</b></a> is not due back from international duty with Colombia until Saturday, so it remains to be seen if he will be rushed back into Gerrard's team.</p>
      <p>Hamilton provisional squad: Fon Williams, Fjortoft, Hamilton, Hunt, McMann, Want, Gogic, Hughes, MacKinnon, Beck, Smith, Cunningham, Oakley, Miller, Moyo, Davies, Gourlay.</p>
      <p>Rangers provisional squad: McGregor, Flanagan, Tavernier, Helander, Halliday, Barisic, Edmundson, Goldson, Katic, Davis, Jack, Aribo, Kamara, King, Arfield, Barker, Kent, Ojo, Defoe, Morelos, Stewart, Murphy, Foderingham.</p>
