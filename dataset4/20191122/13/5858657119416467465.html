      <p>“IHIT is seeking to develop a timeline of events leading up to the report of the burning vehicle and discovery of the body. While we are unable to confirm if Mr. Dhaliwal was the victim in this case, we are interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen or spoken to him, says Sgt. Frank Jang in a release. We must also wait for the conclusive findings from the autopsy as well as DNA verification before we are able to positively identify the victim.”</p>
      <p>Police want anyone with information to call the IHIT information line at 1-877-551- IHIT (4448), or send an email to ihitinfo@rcmp-grc.gc.ca.</p>
