      <h1>Gen Z's meme streak hits home as battle of the generations begins – again</h1>
      <h2>The younger folk aren't happy. And they have the branded sweatshirts, phone cases, stickers and pins to prove it.</h2>

      <p>The world is overdue a good, old-fashioned battle of the generations. There hasn’t been one in ages, at least not in my lifetime. When I was growing up, the quintessential parent-child relationship on television was Saffy and Edina’s on<i> Absolutely Fabulou</i>s: an eye-rolling, flannel-shirt-wearing daughter, forever attempting to coax her bell-bottomed, hard-partying mother away from the Dom Perignon, at least until after breakfast.</p>
      <p>Saffy was quintessential Gen X, in that she couldn’t be bothered rebelling. Then along came Millennials. We were also the children of Boomers, but rather than begrudgingly accept a flawed status quo, we embraced it. Capitalism, meet apps. Our patron saint is Mark Zuckerberg, who is very good at exploiting resources – in this case the basest human emotions – while claiming to do good. (His most recent revisionist claim is that Facebook got started not as a way to meet girls but rather as a forum to express concerns about the Iraq War. “Sure, Jan,” is the Millennials’ internet meme for expressing scepticism; it’s an appropriate response here.)</p>

      <p>Gen Zers are different. They’re leaving high school, voting in their first elections, looking around and realising they don’t like how things look, not one little bit. And their new catchphrase? “OK, Boomer”, with the comma essential for conveying a soupçon of icy disdain. Young people blame the demographic born between 1945 and 1963 for rising inequality, unaffordable university fees, political polarisation and the climate crisis, and they have the “OK, Boomer” branded sweatshirts, phone cases, stickers and pins to prove it.</p>
      <p>“OK, Boomer” started where all trends nowadays do, on the social media app TikTok, where teenagers swap short and aggressively edited videos. It recently spread all the way to the New Zealand parliament after a 25-year-old Green Party MP used it to shut down a heckler. It’s a powerful putdown, but the tech columnist Farhad Manjoo (a Gen Xer, always looking to make peace) has suggested that vilifying an age group is the wrong way of bringing about change. Instead, he writes, “Okay, billionaire” would be a more effective rallying cry, because it gets at the drivers of inequality, which many (especially younger people) see as the defining problem of our time.</p>
      <p>There is significant crossover between billionaires and Boomers (Gates, Bezos, Ballmer). But for every notorious Boomer (Donald Trump) there’s a universally beloved one (Oprah). There are also plenty of older people trying to help change things right now. Such as Jane Fonda, who has been arrested every Friday for the past month or so protesting about climate change outside of Congress here in Washington, DC. Fonda feels so strongly about the issue that she has moved to the nation’s capital, sometimes called “Hollywood for ugly people” – all so she can shine her starlight on the plight of a warming world.</p>

      <p>Now, Fonda isn’t technically a Boomer at all (she was born in 1937), but she’s a figurehead of that generation for her role in its signature fight, against the Vietnam War. Dismissing an entire cohort of people as useless does make me uncomfortable, but maybe making oldies uncomfortable is the entire point of being young. Besides – in sparking a generational conflict, isn’t Gen Z paying the ultimate compliment to the Boomers before them? Next we’ll be telling them they need to cut their hair.</p>
