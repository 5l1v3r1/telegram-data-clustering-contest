      <h1>Retirement Advisor: Between A Lump Sum And An Annuity (Podcast)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">SA For FAs</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Brookings Institution’s Retirement Security Project suggests that managed-payout funds might be the Goldilocks option between lump sums and annuities.</li>
        <li>Unlike target-date funds, which seek capital appreciation, mitigated by an age-based formula for reducing exposure to market risk, managed-payout funds offer a distribution target, such as 4%.</li>
        <li>Investors don’t get the guarantee of an annuity, but they get a conservatively managed fund, providing a retirement paycheck, and their capital does not die with them.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This podcast (<b>6:44</b>) notes that Brookings’ policy wonks are proposing very much the sort of retirement portfolio that many financial advisors seek to put in place – a growth portfolio, a monthly paycheck, an emergency fund and longevity protection.</p>
