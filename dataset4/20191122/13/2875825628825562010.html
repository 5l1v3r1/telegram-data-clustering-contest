      <p>Trevor Lunn was visiting a business called Lambeg Dog Walking on what he says was a planning issue when the incident occurred on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A video of the incident was shared on the business’s <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> on Thursday and sparked an angry reaction from some people.</p>
      <p>It is understood an issue exists with regard to planning involving the business and <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/lisburn-city-and-castlereagh-district-council">Lisburn &amp; Castlereagh City Council.</a></p>

      <p>In a statement issued on Friday, <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/alliance-party">Mr Lunn</a> said: “I visited the facility on a planning issue and spent a few minutes inside with the dogs. We went into the yard and one of the dogs jumped up.</p>
      <p>“I intended to shoo it down but if I hit the dog, I apologise unreservedly. The owner of the facility, who was standing beside me, said nothing at the time.</p>
      <p>“There was no intent to hurt the animal, and as an animal lover and pet owner myself, I am mortified anyone thinks I struck a dog deliberately.”</p>
