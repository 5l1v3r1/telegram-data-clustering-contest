      <p>Obrafour’s old friend, Yaw Labito is really speaking from the pain he has harboured all these years.</p>
      <p>The highlife artiste who sang the chorus on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw8HnNsjjcU">Obrafour’s ‘Odo’ song</a> has revealed that after putting his silky voice on the song, he was forced to live under the shadow.</p>
      <p>To him, his shine was taken from him as Obrafour intentionally refused to feature him in the music video.</p>
      <p>According to Yaw Labito in an interview with Sammy Flex, <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/obrafours-old-friend-yaw-labito-fights-him-over-his-popular-odo-song/">Obrafour intentionally neglected his presence during the video shoot of the ‘Odo’ song.</a></p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>“We recorded ‘Odo’ and the song became an instant hit. We went behind Achimota forest to shoot the video for the song. When it got to my part of the song, the director asked Obrafour to let me sing my part of the, but to my surprise, he told the director in my presence that the video will be used for a documentary.”</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><i><b>“I felt bad but told people who asked why I wasn’t featured in the video that I had travelled during the shoot,”</b></i> he narrated.</p>
      <p>After all these years, he thought the dust will finally settle for him to get his shine but he was once again neglected during Obrafour’s recent concert, ‘Pae Mu Ka at 20’.</p>
      <p>According to Yaw Labito, he was called by Obraofur to help him with the ‘Back to Taifa’ which was held in October, some few weeks before the grand ‘Pae Mu Ka’ concert.</p>
      <p>He agreed and performed with Obrafour on the same ‘Odo’ song but during the ‘Pae Mu Ka’ concert, he was substituted for Bisa Kdei who sang his part of the song.</p>
      <p>Narrating what happened, he revealed that he reached out to Obrafour prior to the concert but was told he was granting a radio interview and will be attended to after the interview but that didn’t happen. He tried several times but all proved futile.</p>
      <p>He later saw the video after several people started calling him on why he didn’t make an appearance during the performance of the song.</p>
