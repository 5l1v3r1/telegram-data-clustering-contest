      <p>Take Me Out plummets into toilet humour with gruesome "hair poo" flirting.</p>
      <p>In eyebrow raising scenes, potential date Chloe asks guest Charlie if his poo is "really hairy" when they speak for the first time on the dating show.</p>
      <p>In his VT, the guest's mum divulges her son's bizarre habit of perfectly shaping his eyebrows and devouring all the hairs.</p>
      <p>As always, the audience of girls waiting to go on a date with the handsome sports therapist had a lot of questions.</p>
      <p>But Chloe only has one thing on her mind. She says: "I’ve got a question, is your poo really hairy?"</p>
      <p>Take Me Out host Paddy McGuinness jaw hits the floor when he watches on in horror.</p>
      <p>Feeling the embarrassment, the TV host crawls into the lift and pleads for it to go up.</p>

      <p>He says: "Take me up, anything! That’s a vision I’ll never be able to unsee!"</p>
      <p>Already, Paddy is left feeling sick by the idea of Charlie munching on his eyebrows.</p>
      <p>The dad gags and pretends to be sick after the VT plays out on the screen for the potential pool of dates.</p>

      <p>He says: "I went with the egg whites Charlie but I’m not having that! [to Chloe] I mean, Chloe, I’m gonna ask you why you turned off but I think we know why."</p>
      <p>Charlie's mum let her son's secret out the bag as she attempts to get him a date by painting a realistic picture of the sports therapist.</p>
      <p>And as it turns out, she leaves nothing out.</p>
      <p>Charlie’s mum could be heard saying: "My son Charlie, his eyebrows are always on point. But he picks them himself and he has an unusual way of disposing of the remains – he eats them.</p>
      <p>"So girls, if Charlie’s eyebrow munching doesn’t make you frown, he could be the one for you."</p>
