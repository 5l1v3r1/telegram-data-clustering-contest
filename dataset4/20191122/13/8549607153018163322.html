      <h3>Ubisoft to Help in the Capacity of a Corporate Block Producer</h3>
      <p>According to the report, <a href="https://btcmanager.com/tag/ubisoft/">Ubisoft</a> will aid Ultra’s UOS blockchain in the capacity of a corporate block producer during a trial period on the network’s testnet. For the uninitiated, block producers typically provide the required infrastructure to validate transactions on a particular blockchain.</p>
      <p>For Ultra, such transactions include in-game assets creation, ownership transfers between players or payment confirmations. Similarly, for the UOS blockchain – a sister branch of EOSIO – it is of prime importance to onboard block producers who not only have an interest in the space but also the necessary capability and talent to successfully complete technical validation tasks.</p>
      <p>Nicolas Gilot, founder and co-CEO, Ultra, commented on the development saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>Ubisoft’s rich portfolio of world-renowned brands, including Assassin’s Creed, Just Dance, and Far Cry, is a testament to their dedication to creating quality content for all, and their years-long dedication to exploring blockchain technology ensures they have the knowledge and skills to be excellent block producers.</b>“</blockquote>
      <p>In the same vein, Nicolas Pouard, blockchain initiative director, Ubisoft, said:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>Our team at the Strategic Innovation Lab strongly believes that all blockchain use cases that bring value to players are important to support, and Ultra offers a solution that does just that. During this first trial period of collaboration, we hope to help them in bringing it to a larger scale and experiment with the possibilities this opens up for the industry.</b>“</blockquote>
      <h4>Testnet Scheduled to Go-Live Before 2019 End</h4>
      <p>While Ultra has managed to land a big fish in Ubisoft, the exact details about its blockchain’s mainnet launch remain open to speculation. At present, it is only known that Ubisoft will begin contributing to Ultra’s testnet before the end of 2019 and, if successful, will be part of the launch team for the project’s upcoming mainnet.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that this isn’t Ubisoft’s first stint with distributed ledger technology (DLT). As <a href="https://btcmanager.com/ubisoft-sorare-fantasy-football-blockchain-gaming/?q=/ubisoft-sorare-fantasy-football-blockchain-gaming/&amp;">reported</a> by <i>BTCManager</i> on October 11, 2019, the French gaming giant had partnered with blockchain firm Sorare to foster fantasy football blockchain gaming.</p>
