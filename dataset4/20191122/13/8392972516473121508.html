      <p>New neighbours Toby and Celeste Faroe - played by Bobby Gordon and Andrea Ali - move into Mitchell and Cleo's old flat - but all is not what it seems.</p>
      <aside>I couldn't be more proud and excited to join the Hollyoaks team.</aside>
      <p>At first, Darren immediately hits it off with music producer Toby and Mandy finds she has lots in common with modelling agent Celeste.</p>

      <p>The sophisticated couple arrive in the village on Thursday (November 28), and share a manipulative streak that entices them to play some devious mind games with their new 'friends'.</p>
      <p>Talking about his new role, Bobby Gordon said: "My whole life I've been waiting for my opportunity to be on screen and I thought it was never going to happen.</p>
      <p>"After having a year of ups and downs, I was given the chance and I couldn't be more proud and excited to join the Hollyoaks team.</p>
      <p>"Since joining, the crew and cast have been incredible and I still can't believe all of the exciting things they have planned for me in the future."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Andrea Ali said: "Hollyoaks has truly been one the most amazing experiences.</p>
      <p>"The diversity of the cast and the truly relatable storylines are an honour to be a part of. From cast to crew, I couldn't have asked to work with a better set of people!"</p>
      <p>It won't take long for viewers to realise there is far more to the glamorous pair, when it becomes clear they have fiendish plans for Jesse and the other villagers.</p>
      <p>They arrive and promise Jesse they will bring their famous clients and friends to his salon but they let Jesse down at the last minute, leaving him humiliated...</p>

      <p>But what else do they have in store?</p>
      <p>Viewers know that Darren and Mandy have had their fair share of troubles recently, having to come to grips with DJ's true parentage and Ollie's own baby bombshell.</p>
      <p>Are their new neighbours about to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/hollyoaks-spoilers-darren-osborne-faces-very-serious-mental-health-story/">add to their problems</a>?</p>
