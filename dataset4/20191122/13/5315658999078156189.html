      <h1>Medical cannabis company, Puro, breaks crowdfunding record</h1>

      <p>South Island medical cannabis company, Puro, breaks crowdfunding record</p>
      <p>Medical cannabis start-up Puro has already raised just under $2.2 million on PledgeMe, the highest amount ever raised in PledgeMe’s crowdfunding history.</p>
      <p>Christchurch businessman Tim Aldridge, Puro’s managing director, says the response so far has been incredible.</p>
      <p>“There’s a big appetite out there to become part of our journey and make a real difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders,” say Aldridge.</p>
      <p>“Before we went to PledgeMe we worked really hard to get all our ducks in row. We were the first medical cannabis company to undertake an equity crowdfunding campaign with a licence, we secured premium Marlborough land, built an expert team, and had buyers lined up”.</p>
      <p>“The fact that so many kiwis are backing us feels like a real vote of confidence in what we’re doing. It’s also a sign that investors recognise this is a rapidly growing industry with enormous economic potential for New Zealand.”</p>
      <p>Puro is running two simultaneous PledgeMe campaigns. They are seeking to raise $2 million in an equity crowdfunding campaign (minimum investment of $500) and another $2 million in a wholesale campaign (minimum investment of $50,000).</p>
      <p>With 14 days still to go, they have raised $1,641,069 in their equity crowdfunding campaign and $550,000 in their wholesale campaign.</p>
      <p>PledgeMe spokesman Tan Huynh says Puro has surpassed the $2.06 million raised by brewer Behemoth Brewing, who also ran two simultaneous campaigns.</p>
      <p>“We knew craft beer was an exciting for investors but Puro have taken medicinal cannabis to the next level.”</p>
      <p>Huynh says by raising $2.19 million Puro have also eclipsed the Australian PledgeMe record of $2.15million AUD.</p>
      <p>Aldridge says it’s not too late to invest.</p>
      <p>“We’re positioned to become New Zealand’s largest grower of premium medical cannabis grower, and are delighted kiwis can see our potential.”</p>
      <p>The money raised will be spent on building a research centre and initial growing facilities, site security and expansion into overseas markets.</p>
