        <b>The fight that happened between Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz in Bigg Boss 13 was an ugly one. It grabbed a lot of attention and continues being spoken about.

      <p>Things can get unpredictable in the Bigg Boss house. As the inmates are fighting to save themselves, even the best of friends can be at loggerheads or turn enemies.</p>
      <p>Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz’s friendship hit rock bottom in the house. This week, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-november-20-spoiler-alert-sidharth-shukla-asim-riaz-s-fight-goes-worse-shehnaaz-does-drama-again/5dd4a9f387fb571eff7e41f5">the two had an ugly fight</a> during a task which escalated to such an extent that Sidharth pushed Asim while the latter mouthed abuses. Now, ex-contestant Tehseen Poonawalla who also had an altercation with Asim in the past has come out in support of Sidharth.<br/><br/>Speaking exclusively to SpotboyE.com, Tehseen says, “I believe Sidharth is correct. Asim rode on Sidd’s popularity. When I was there, I saw Asim as nothing more than a tail of Sidharth and now the tail thinks! He is a snake! In this case, Sidharth was not at fault. He was doing his task; Shehnaaz wanted an orange not an apple and Sidd was correct in asking for the fruit. Shehnaaz was demanding. Asim was an idiot to be giving apples instead of the oranges that were asked for. On top of it, Asim pushed Sidd first,” he says.</p>

      <p>He adds, “Asim is very unhygienic when it comes to the toilets or even other hygiene. For example, he puts his dirty hands in the sugar jar to eat plain sugar as a sweet and then he puts the same sugar back from his dirty hands, which touched his mouth, into the jar. He also thinks he is a tough kid. I was the only person with whom he did not retaliate when he tried to fight me and I took him on!  He thinks he is a bully but he knew the consequences of messing with me. Hence, he curled his tail between his legs and backed off. Every housemate was happy I put him in his place.”</p>

      <p>Tehseen adds that he would have managed this situation differently if he was there. “Had I been there in the house, after what he did with Sidd, I would have intervened and Asim would have paid heavily for it. Bullying is unacceptable and I just can't stand bullies, who think they can push someone. Play the game decently don't be a bully. That's my advice to everyone there,” he says.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source;- instagram/tehseenpoonawalla</i></p>
