      <h1>'Cultural tragedy': time to celebrate Aussie aviation trailblazers</h1>

      <p>When astronaut Andy Thomas boarded the space shuttle Endeavour in 1996 with the rest of the crew, he carried a souvenir, the cloth wings of two little-known aviation pioneers who grew up in his home state of South Australia.</p>
      <p>In 1919, after PM William “Billy” Hughes offered a prize of £10,000 (almost $1 million in today’s money) for the first successful flight to Australia from Great Britain within 30 days, brothers Ross and Keith Smith flew a remodelled World War I heavy bomber, a “Vickers Vimy”, made of canvas, wire and wood with an open cockpit, from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome, London, to a Darwin airstrip.</p>

      <p>The astonishing 18,000-kilometre journey (the brothers were likely the first to take aerial photos of India’s Taj Mahal) took 28 days, secured them the prizemoney (which they shared with their two onboard mechanics) and paved the way for long-haul travel.</p>

      <p>Thomas believes the names Ross and Keith Smith should be up there beside another more famous Smith: Charles Kingsford, who made the first trans-Pacific flight in 1928.</p>

      <p>“It is a cultural tragedy that the flight has been lost in the mists of history,” says Thomas, who is the host of a new documentary, <i>The Greatest Air Race,</i> which will air on SBS on December 8, on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the Smith brothers’ landing in Darwin on December 10, 1919. Their achievement was lauded in newspapers across the globe – <i>The New York Times </i>called Ross Smith the “foremost living aviator” – and hundreds of thousands greeted them in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.</p>
      <p>Australian aviation anniversaries are in the news at present. Sydney Airport recently celebrated its 100th anniversary with a gala dinner for 600 people just west of its main runway, and next November Qantas will mark a century since the founding of Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services by Hudson Fysh, Paul McGinness and Fergus McMaster.</p>
      <p>“By coincidence, Fysh and McGinness were commissioned to survey northern Australia for landing strips for the Great Air Race,” says Thomas. But the journey of Ross and Keith Smith stays with the 67-year-old the most. “The risks were huge, requiring extreme bravery.”</p>
