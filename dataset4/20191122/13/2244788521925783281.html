      <p>The parliament in Austria has two chambers namely; the national council and federal council. The national council of 183 members are elected by all citizens entitled to vote, every year or sometimes sooner.</p>
      <p>Benjamin, 57, has worked as a management consultant and a director of Meriben Limited, a London-based company, with years of experience in the management sub-sector.</p>
      <p>Nigerians have proven viable outside the country, getting elected as lawmakers in foreign parliaments.</p>
      <p>The likes of Uzoma Asagwara, a nurse, broke a 150-year <b><a href="https://www.thecable.ng/close-up-uzoma-asagwara-nigerian-nurse-who-broke-a-150-year-record-in-canadian-parliament">record</a></b> in Canadian Parliament after emerging as the first black to be elected to the Manitoba legislature representing Union station constituency.</p>
      <p>Also, Zulfat Suara, a Nigerian-American, <a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/zulfat-suara-becomes-first-muslim-elected-to-nashville-city-government"><b>emerged</b></a> as the first Muslim lawmaker in Tennessee in the United States, after making it into the runoff of a Nashville council at-large election.</p>
