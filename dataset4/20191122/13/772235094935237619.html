      <p><b>Darcy Foster • </b>Ken Block is at it again.</p>
      <p>Dubbed <b>‘Climbkhana Two’,</b> the latest 'khana' video sees the rally and drift ace take on the 99-turn, 11km <b>Tianmen Mountain</b> road in <b>China.</b></p>
      <p>Ken’s ascent to ‘Heaven’s Gate’ (the literal Mandarin translation of ‘Tianmen’) required serious planning, but luckily he had one of the newest tools in his automotive arsenal for the job; the Hoonitruck.</p>
      <p>Built by Detroit Speed Inc to Hoonigans exact specification, the Hoonitruck continues Block's recent design philosophy of turning classic vehicles into fire-breathing monsters, starting by the ‘Hoonicorn’ and continued with ‘The Cossie’ (below).</p>

      <p>The Hoonitruck’s power comes from a twin-turbo V6 closely related to the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/ford-gt/">Ford GT’s</a> motor.</p>
      <p>Thanks in part to a 3D-printed intake manifold from Ford Performance, the Hoonitruck produces <b>681kW</b> and around <b>950Nm</b> of torque.</p>
      <p>Drive is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed sequential transmission, complete with a hydraulic handbrake to make those Scandi flicks a tad easier.</p>
      <p>With its stance measured over two metres wide, the Hoonitruck uses a heavily-modified <b>1977 Ford F-150</b> body underpinned by a modular, custom-fabricated chassis.</p>
      <p>This means that it's easier for mechanics to interchange significant portions of the vehicle – with projects/technical lead manager of Detroit Speed Inc, Chris Porter, stating replacing the tail section of the truck could take as little as "30 to 45 minutes".</p>

      <p>Fifteen52 supplied custom wheels specifically for the Hoonitruck with 315/35 20 rubber from Toyo Tyres, and stopping force comes from six-piston Wilwood brake calipers with 14-inch (35.5cm) rotors.</p>
      <p>As the Gymkhana video series has spread, Block has looked to take it abroad – <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/753258/ken-block-australia-speed-limits/">including to Australia.</a></p>
      <p>But unfortunately, the shoot was ultimately cancelled after stringent regulations were imposed on what the film crew could and couldn’t do.</p>
      <p>"The higher we went up the tree, we got to a certain point where that person said, 'okay well, I'm allowing Hoonigan on my streets, okay if you only go the speed limit'," Block told <i>CarAdvice.</i></p>
      <p>Block and his team encountered similar reception from the government in Detroit when scouting locations for Gymkhana 3.</p>
      <p>On a more positive note, he's promised more videos in the future with an electric-powered ‘Hoonicar’ on the way.</p>
