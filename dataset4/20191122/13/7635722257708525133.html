      <h1>Britain labelled "illegal colonial occupier" after refusing to return islands to Mauritius</h1>

        <b>Britain has been labelled an ‘illegal colonial occupier’ for refusing to return a set of islands it took from Mauritius in the 1960s.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes after the UN General overwhelmingly agreed that the Chagos Islands should be returned.</p>
      <p>The archipelago is located around 500km from the Maldives.</p>
      <p>Britain purchased the islands for £3m in 1965 when Mauritius was still a British colony.</p>
      <p>The country has said it was forced to give up the archipelago in exchange for independence, which it won in 1968.</p>
      <p>The UK is refusing to recognise the Mauritius sovereignty over the islands and insisting it has every right to hold on to them.</p>
      <p>One of the islands, Diego Garcia, is home to a US military airbase.</p>
      <p>In order to build the base, Britain expelled thousands of Chagossians from their homelands between 1968 and 1974.</p>
      <p>They were sent more than 1,000 miles away to Mauritius and the Seychelles, where they faced extreme poverty and discrimination.</p>
      <p>The UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for the islands to be returned “as a symbol of the way in which we wish to behave in international law.”</p>
      <p>In May, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly voted for the islands to be returned to Mauritius within six months.</p>
      <p>Some 116 backed the move with only six voting against.</p>
      <p>That came just three months after the UN’s high court called on Britain to leave the islands “as rapidly as possible.”</p>
      <p>The UN said that the decolonisation of Mauritius “was not conducted in a manner consistent with the right to self-determination” and that therefore the UKs contuned administration of the islands “constitutes a wrongful act.”</p>
      <p>The six month deadline passed this afternoon and the Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has said that the UK was now an illegal colonial occupier.</p>
