      <p>The government plans to spend around ¥400 billion ($3.7 billion) to supply more computers to public schools as part of an economic stimulus package, government sources said Friday.</p>
      <p>State and local outlays for the package, which will be formulated early next month, are expected to total around ¥10 trillion, including ¥3 trillion worth of investment and loans for infrastructure development, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The stimulus measures will be financed by an extra budget for fiscal 2019 and an initial budget for fiscal 2020, both of which will be drafted next month.</p>
      <p>To use information and communications technology in education, the government will ensure each student from the fifth to ninth grades has access to a computer at school.</p>
      <p>Nationwide, an average of 5.4 students share one computer in public elementary and junior high schools across the country, according to the education ministry.</p>
      <p>The government will also financially support efforts to set up wireless networks in classrooms and to introduce educational software, the sources said.</p>
      <p>As for infrastructure development, the government will extend around ¥400 billion in loans to finance projects such as a third runway at Narita airport by the end of fiscal 2028, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this month instructed his ministers to draw up the stimulus package to safeguard growth following the consumption tax hike in October to 10 percent.</p>
      <p>The government will also earmark around ¥150 billion to subsidize purchases of vehicles with automatic braking and other advanced safety systems, as well as nearly ¥100 billion to develop highly advanced “post-5G” wireless network technologies, the sources said.</p>
