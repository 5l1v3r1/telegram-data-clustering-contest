      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/victorian-town-mildura-unliveable-massive-dust-storm-40c-heat">The Guardian</a>, Victoria issued a code red bushfire alert as the region faces some of the worst fire conditions in 10 years. <b>Residents of Mildura were shocked to see that the bushfire and dust storm rolling in on midday on Thursday turned the sky an angry red. </b></p>
      <p>Shocking images of the area shows the sky and surroundings an eerie orange and red. Residents said that it was like walking outside into a wall of dust and conditions were seriously unliveable. The dust storm and bushfire had turned the sky into a dark, thick orange and there’s no sound coming from the animals.</p>

      <p>The mass of hot air in the country has blanketed Victoria and South Australia, while winds of destruction carrying flames, smoke and dust were described as near-cyclonic. These strong winds made the bushfires even stronger as the gales fanned the flames. Properties were burned down in parts of South Australia while people were experiencing breathing problems. <b>At least 60 people have suffered from health complications caused by the thick haze and dust this week.</b></p>

Various areas of Australia are still blanketed with haze although the fire crews and authorities are fighting the bushfires.</p>

      <p><b>Residents of Mildura said that these dust storms are becoming more common, and they said that this is due to mismanagement of Australia’s own natural resources, climate change and human greed.</b> One resident said, “The dust storms are becoming incredibly frequent. I actually asked my next-door neighbour, he is 84 years old and has lived in Mildura most of his life. I asked if he had seen it like this before. He said he hasn’t seen anything like this since 1944-45.”</p>

        <i>That’s really scary! Hope the bushfire conditions in Australia get better soon!</i>
