      <p>Bangladesh’s <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Mehidy-Hasan">Mehidy Hasan</a> and Taijul Islam were named concussion substitutes for <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Liton-Das">Liton Das</a> and Nayeem Hasan respectively after both batsmen picked up knocks on the helmet by Mohammed Shami deliveries, during their first innings against India on Day 1 of the second Test at the Eden Gardens on Friday.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh now have two concussion replacements. Mehidy can only bat as he replaced a batsman while Taijul can bowl for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Liton was looking good on 15 when a quick Shami delivery thudded on to his helmet. He took off his helmet immediately and took a look as Shami walked up to apologise.</p>
      <p>The physiotherapist rushed in as per the latest concussion protocols. Liton continued for some time but after umpires Joel Wilson and Marais Erasmus had a look just before tea, he was seen walking off and later retired hurt.</p>
      <p>Liton scored a brisk 24 to show some fight after all Bangladesh batsmen succumbed to the might of the Indian pace battery.</p>
      <p>Nayeem, playing his first match of the two-match series, scored 19 and was hit on the helmet just after tea.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ishant Sharma took five wickets to lead the pacers’ show as Bangladesh were shot out for 106 before the hosts reached 35/1 at dinner break on Day 1 of the first Day-Night Test in the country at the Eden Gardens here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Opener Rohit Sharma, who was dropped on 12 by Al Amin Hossain off Abu Jayed, was batting on 13 with Cheteshwar Pujara who was unbeaten on 7.</p>
      <p>Mayank Agarwal, who scored a career-best 243 in the first Test, was caught at gully by Mehidy Hasan off Al Amin.</p>
