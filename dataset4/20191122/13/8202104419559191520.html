      <h3>Joel Pedersen never really considered himself a role model.</h3>
      <p>Not when he was a Canadian Forces soldier deployed to Cyprus and the Middle East, and not during the quarter-century he spent on the streets as a Saskatoon police officer. He simply tried to conduct himself as a professional, he says.</p>
      <p>It was simply about doing the best he could.</p>
      <p>“I knew I couldn’t save the world. I knew I couldn’t change the world,” the 49-year old entrepreneur said during a recent interview at Station 20 West in Saskatoon as the year’s first snow blanketed the street outside.</p>
      <p>“But I think one of the things I did find pretty quickly is that you can help people. You can’t help everyone, but you can help some,” he said, referring to his time as one of the city’s first Indigenous police officers.</p>
      <p>Today, Pedersen does his best to help people through Fitness 2J2, the “socially responsible, community-based health and fitness” company he founded in 2011 and has been concentrating on since leaving the police in 2016.</p>
      <p>He figures more than 30,000 people across the province and the country have been touched by the company in some way, whether through public programs in Saskatoon or remote First Nations, or private consulting and classes.</p>
      <p>“Joel’s a really good example of what we need more of,” said Jennifer Altenberg, who is serving her third term as chair of the Pleasant Hill Community Association, in the neighbourhood where Pedersen spends much of his time.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t ever have a deficit mindset. He’s constantly looking for opportunities to explore and engage the community,” she said of Fitness 2J2’s programs, which have grown dramatically over the last several years.</p>

      <p>While Altenberg and others are effusive about Pedersen’s efforts to not only provide programs where they would not otherwise exist, but also to infuse young people with a sense of physical and emotional well-being, his influence stretches beyond Fitness 2J2.</p>
      <p>John Langan described his childhood on Keeseekoose First Nation near Kamsack as “not the best.” He wanted to become a police officer, but figured that was never going to happen “because of the stuff I’ve been through,” he said.</p>
      <p>Langan met Pedersen about a decade ago after joining the Canadian Army Reserves. He looked up to the older man immediately, both for his emphasis on fitness as the key to well-being and his infectious and inspiring energy.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Pedersen donned his Saskatoon police uniform for a special ceremony during which he pinned on Langan’s badge. Langan, 31, is now in his third year as a constable, is married and a father to three young children.</p>
      <p>“He made me think that it was actually possible,” Langan said.</p>
      <p>Pedersen now recognizes that the years he spent with the Canadian Army Reserves — where he continues to serve as a chief warrant officer — and with the police showed him he could make a difference.</p>
      <p>But he had the tools to make that difference all along.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Growing up on the banks of the Assiniboine River in Brandon, Manitoba, Pedersen spent as much time as he could outside, paddling canoes and whacking tennis balls in the summer or chasing pucks across the ice in the depths of winter.</p>
      <p>Born to a mother from Fond du Lac Denesuline First Nation and a father from Miskew Cree First Nation in northern Alberta, he spent the first 11 years of his life in Brandon with adoptive parents.</p>
      <p>Although he has spent most of his life working to learn more about his Indigenous culture, he describes his childhood as anything but deprived. It was rich with literature, learning and, most importantly, physical activity, he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a part of my life ever since I was a little kid. I’ve always been physically active.”</p>
      <p>While his family’s long history of service — which he said goes back at least to the Boer War — led him to the military and, later, policing, physical activity has been a constant companion, even when times were tough.</p>
      <p>Pedersen spent his teenage years in Prince Albert after his parents separated, and ultimately joined the Saskatoon police in 1992. It was, he recalls, a “challenging time” — a reference to Neil Stonechild and “starlight tours.”</p>
      <p>As an Indigenous police officer, “you often bore the brunt of it,” up to and including being called a “white racist” by other Indigenous people, he said. But that didn’t deter him from doing his best to help.</p>
      <p>“It’s just the small things — stopping to play a little game of basketball or playing some street hockey with some kids who had not ever seen a uniformed police officer do something like that,” he said.</p>

      <p>Pedersen began contemplating his future in 2011, after around 20 years of policing. He said 25 years was always going to be enough time for him, in part because he didn’t want to be defined by his career.</p>
      <p>That’s when Fitness 2J2 was born — the name refers to his two sons and two daughters, with himself in the middle. It was born from him making a list of the things he enjoyed most: fitness, community and leadership.</p>
      <p>In his view, the company — he has resisted turning it into a non-profit because he does not want his vision altered by a board of directors — helps solve the problem of limited programming he identified in communities large and small.</p>
      <p>“There’s no use tabling reports, having committees saying, ‘These are the problems, this is what needs to be done.’ Who’s doing it? There is nobody doing it. It’s a way of filling some of the gaps,” he said.</p>
      <p>Altenberg, whose Pleasant Hill neighbourhood has been linked to a wave of violence that swept through Saskatoon this summer, praised Pedersen’s responsiveness, self-defence classes being the main example.</p>

      <p>Veronica Morin, who participated in a Fitness 2J2 self-defence class at White Buffalo Youth Lodge last fall, said she hopes the program will build her confidence and help her stay fit and ready for anything.</p>
      <p>“I’m a single parent and oldest of all my siblings, so I’m pretty protective of everybody. It helps to know these things when you’re at home by yourself a lot with your kids and you have to know how to protect your family,” she said.</p>
      <p>That isn’t the only positive Pedersen is offering, Altenberg said. Not only do his classes give people something positive to do for themselves, they also send the right signals to the young and impressionable.</p>
      <p>“That’s going to be a lasting impression into adulthood,” she said.</p>
      <p>Langan said that has a similar effect on First Nations, particularly in the province’s north, where simply staying occupied can be a challenge. Moreover, Pedersen’s success is an inspiration to many he meets, he said.</p>
      <p>Pedersen said he never imagined Fitness 2J2 would touch so many lives, or how emphasizing that physical fitness leads to emotional and spiritual well-being would help so many of them, like Langan.</p>
      <p>“His father passed away many, many years ago, but he invited me to serve him his badge when he graduated. That was really cool,” Pedersen said.</p>
      <p>Asked whether his view on being a role model has changed, Pedersen paused before answering.</p>
      <p>“I don’t take the title lightly at all, if it is a title. But it’s action. And it’s more than just words.”</p>
