      <p>Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, has hailed Igbo efforts on national unity.</p>
      <p>While describing the Igbo as great people, Ooni called for unity among Nigerians regardless of tribes, ethnicity, and religious backgrounds.</p>
      <p>He said a united nation would enjoy peace and progress.</p>
      <p>He spoke during the  World Eri Festival at Enugwu Aguleri, Anambra State.</p>
      <p>The monarch who was represented by the Asoya of Ile Isoya Ife, Oba Murainu Adebanjo said he was happy to be part of the event, describing Ndigbo as great people.</p>
      <p>He said, “I’m interested in national unity because it will guarantee peace as well as bring the best of the people into a more prosperous country where the safety, security and people’s happiness are guaranteed.</p>
      <p>“A peaceful and prosperous country is all that we are praying for and we can only get it when we are strongly united as a people.”</p>
      <p>He commended the Eze Eri and his people for organizing the event, just as he praised the African Americans that attended the function.</p>
      <p>“My prayer is that the festival will continue to serve as a rallying point for the integration of people.</p>
      <p>The President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, said the Eri Kingdom had made Ndigbo proud through the festival.</p>
      <p>He described Ooni’s visit as the most recent handshake across the Niger from the cultural point of view.</p>
      <p>He said, “The festival not only showcases the culture of Ndigbo to the rest of the world but  helps to connect them with others in a manner that enhances friendship between them and their counterparts.”</p>
