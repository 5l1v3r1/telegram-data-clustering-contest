      <h1>Collaborators Awarded Bachmann-Strauss Prize for Excellence in Dystonia Research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Chapman</a></address>
      <p>Investigative collaborators from the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/home/">University of Alabama at Birmingham</a> (UAB) and the <a href="http://web.uniroma2.it/">University of Rome Tor Vergata</a> in Italy have been awarded the fifth annual <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/bachmann-strauss-prize">Bachmann-Strauss Prize for Excellence in Dystonia Research</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/">Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) for Parkinson’s Research</a> presented the awards recently to UAB’s David G. Standaert, MD, PhD, and John N. Whitaker professor and chairman of neurology, and to the University of Rome Tor Vergata’s Antonio Pisani, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurology.</p>
      <p>The award is for significant contributions to <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/dystonia-and-pd/">dystonia</a> research, and comes with an unrestricted grant of $100,000 to support further joint research. Also meant to motivate the next generation of investigators, the award is part of a <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/publication/michael-j-fox-foundation-forms-new-partnership-bachmann-strauss-dystonia-and-parkinsons">partnership announced in 2014</a> between the MJFF and the <a href="http://www.dystonia-parkinsons.org/">Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia &amp; Parkinson Foundation</a> (BSDPF).</p>
      <p>“Drs. Pisani and Standaert have made significant strides in plotting the cellular dysfunction that leads to dystonia,” said Bonnie Strauss, BSDPF founder, MJFF board member, and a dystonia patient, in a <a href="https://www.uab.edu/news/people/item/10926-uab-s-standaert-honored-for-dystonia-research">press release</a>. “This team has laid the groundwork for development and testing of new therapies to help those living with dystonia.”</p>
      <p>A generally poorly understood movement disorder <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160809095141.htm">characterized by painful, protracted muscle contractions</a> that cause abnormal movements and postures, dystonia is both a distinct disorder and a common <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/">symptom</a> of <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/">Parkinson’s disease</a>. Dystonia symptoms usually begin in one body region — such as the neck, face, vocal cords, arm, or leg — then may spread to other areas.</p>
      <p>Having co-authored their first published work in 2006, Standaert and Pisani have collaborated on nine research papers detailing dystonia’s pathology. The investigators, who are also practicing clinicians, have examined the role and relationship of neurotransmitter activity in dystonia, and have profiled a <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-what-dopamine">dopamine</a> imbalance and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11143/">acetylcholine</a> activity in a condition type that usually begins in adolescence.</p>
      <p>“We are honored to receive the prestigious Bachmann-Strauss Prize,” Pisani said. “It means we are working in the right direction for our findings to be recognized with such an award, and that we can continue building knowledge toward new <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/movement_disorders/conditions/dystonia.html">treatments</a> and cures.”</p>
      <p>Added Standaert: “This work with Antonio is a very productive collaboration that has been an engine for discovery. There is a tremendous need for more research in the field, and more researchers. I hope this recognition from Bachmann-Strauss and MJFF will demonstrate to young investigators that there is a support and encouragement for research in dystonia and will attract more of them to this field.”</p>
      <p>The researchers will use award funds to collaboratively study multiple models of a genetic form of dystonia to better understand the mutation’s effect.</p>
      <p>The Bachmann-Strauss prize is intended to honor current research, an individual’s past body of work, or both.</p>

              <p>Mary M. Chapman began her professional career at United Press International, running both print and broadcast desks. She then became a Michigan correspondent for what is now Bloomberg BNA, where she mainly covered the automotive industry plus legal, tax and regulatory issues. A member of the Automotive Press Association and one of a relatively small number of women on the car beat, Chapman has discussed the automotive industry multiple times of National Public Radio, and in 2014 was selected as an honorary judge at the prestigious Cobble Beach Concours d’Elegance. She has written for numerous national outlets including Time, People, Al-Jazeera America, Fortune, Daily Beast, MSN.com, Newsweek, The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press. The winner of the Society of Professional Journalists award for outstanding reporting, Chapman has had dozens of articles in The New York Times, including two on the coveted front page. She has completed a manuscript about centenarian car enthusiast Margaret Dunning, titled “Belle of the Concours.”<br/>Fact Checked By:</p>
