      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has revealed the sweet nickname her grandchildren have for her.</p>
      <p>The transgender star, formerly known as Bruce, split from Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner back in 2013 – but she still sees herself as a grandparent to the Kardashian kids.</p>
      <p>During a chat with her campmates in the jungle, Caitlyn revealed she’ll have 20 grandchildren in December.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway then asked what her grandkids call her, and she said: “They came up with Boom Boom. It kinda stuck, it was easy for them to say.”</p>

      <p>“So, little Stormi [Kylie Jenner’s daughter], yeah, she’s like, ‘Ah Boom Boom’s here,” Caitlyn explained.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn also explained why all her kids still call her ‘Dad’, despite her transition.</p>
      <p>She said: “My kids all call me Dad, Kendall asked me first and I said ‘Dad’, I’m your Dad and I’ll always be your Dad till the day I die.”</p>
      <p>“But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my Dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.”</p>
