      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:59:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> 's Instagram account hasn't shared a single post about her husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dan-osborne">Dan Osborne</a> since she entered I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star, 27, is currently battling it out in the Australian jungle as a contestant on the ITV show.</p>
      <p>She's left her account in the hands of someone she trusts to take care of posting while she's away.</p>
      <p>Since she joined the show, her Insta has featured plenty of snaps of Jacqueline in the jungle, as well as an Insta stories shot of the actress with her two daughters.</p>
      <p>That picture was captioned "jungle mummy".</p>
      <p>However, the star's husband Dan has not featured at all.</p>
      <p>He's been busy sharing updates on his own page, including videos of him sitting at home watching his wife on TV every night.</p>

      <p>Dan hasn't been seen on Jacqueline's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page since September, when she shared a picture of the couple enjoying a holiday in Portugal as a plug for the villa company.</p>
      <p>Before that Dan was absent from her page apart from a snap of them in New York in July.</p>
      <p>It means the former Towie star has only been seen on her page twice in the last four months.</p>

      <p>It's been a difficult year for the couple as they split in March amid allegations Dan had snogged Love Island star Alexandra Cane behind Jac's back.</p>
      <p>Dan denied he'd kissed the reality star, but Jacqueline still threw him out of the house.</p>
      <p>However, they later reconciled and got their marriage back on track.</p>
      <p>They are parents to two daughters, Ella and Mia, and Dan has a son, Teddy, from a previous relationship.</p>
