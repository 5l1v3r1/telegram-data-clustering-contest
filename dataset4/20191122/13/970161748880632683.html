      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> has revealed that he has already spoken to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> after he replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham manager earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Lampard won two Premier League titles during Mourinho’s stint at Chelsea and played a key role in the Portuguese’s success at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old will now face his former manager in the Premier League as Spurs host Chelsea on December 22.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho has already aimed his first dig at Chelsea earlier this month <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/jose-mourinho-praises-frank-lampard-reveals-major-concern-chelsea-side-11075865/">when he raised questions about the mentality of Lampard’s younger players in high-profile games</a>.</p>

      <p>‘We had a couple of messages,’ Lampard revealed on Friday when asked about Mourinho’s move to Spurs.</p>
      <p>‘I think history and results speak for themselves. He has done that consistently. It’s what we measure him and us as managers.</p>

      <p>‘It keeps him off Sky Sports for a while!</p>
      <p>‘He has got a good team. They were a lot of people’s favourites to be in the race. Pochettino did a great job.</p>
      <p>‘They have the structure there and will be a threat. They are in the top four race.</p>
      <p>‘When you look at the quality. The strength that they have, Kane and players like that.’</p>
