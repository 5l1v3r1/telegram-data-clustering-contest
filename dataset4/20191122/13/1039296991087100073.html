      <p>The Chinese manufacturer has received over 700 bookings since its launch in July, 2019</p>
      <p>CFMoto India has inaugurated its first showroom in Mumbai, located in Thane-Mumbai megalopolis area. The Mumbai showroom is a 3S (sales, service, spares) setup and there are plans to open similar setups in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati. The company says these 7 dealerships are designed to offer a one stop solution for its customers.</p>
      <p>CF Moto company claims  that it has received over 700 bookings since it entered the Indian market in July, 2019. At present, CF Moto has introduced four motorcycles in India- 300NK, 650NK, 650MT and 650GT. Prices begin from Rs 2.29 lakh for the 300NK and go up to Rs 5.49 lakh for the 650GT. All prices are ex-showroom, pan-India. We were among the first to ride the MT and GTin India and you can read more about them here.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the opening ceremony, Kenneth Chen, Assistant General Manager – Global Sales CFmoto said, “We are happy to unveil our first individual outlet in Mumbai. The company has seen a tremendous acceptance for our launched models and we look forward to exceeding our customer’s expectations by providing them the best value with our product range. The confidence placed by CFMoto’s aficionados and our dealer partners are truly helping us in building the brand’s confidence which will help us offering an unparalleled customer experience with best in-class sales and service.”</p>
      <p>The opening of the new dealership marks a crucial step in expanding CF Moto’s presence in India, especially considering the fact that it is a largely unknown brand in the country and its motorcycles go up against established competition. That said, it has a fairly large presence in global markets. Founded in 1989, CF Moto is based out of Zhejiang Province in China. Currently, the company has a presence in markets such as Australia, Asia and North America. It recently tied-up with Austrian motorcycle manufacturer KTM in October 2017 to build and sell the KTM Duke range of motorcycles. </p>
