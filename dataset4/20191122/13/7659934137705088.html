      <p>Many thousands of Algerians have taken to the capital’s streets to mark the 40th consecutive Friday of vociferous protests against the North African nation’s leadership amid their fears that next month’s presidential poll will be rigged.<br/><br/>Chanting “no election on Dec. 12" and “nothing will stop us," the demonstrators in Algiers Friday demanded an end to Algeria's post-colonial political system, including the departure of acting leader Abdelkader Bensalah and powerful army chief Gen. Ahmed Gaid Salah.<br/><br/>Two former prime ministers, Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune, are candidates in the election to succeed former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika whom the demonstrators ejected from power in April.<br/><br/>Demonstrators want a fresh national election and brand new leaders, but don't want a vote organized by the current leadership, which they deem corrupt, the Associated Press reported.</p>
