      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Virat Kohli became the fastest to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket as captain</li>
        <li>Kohli broke in his 53rd match (86th innings) as India captain</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Virat Kohli broke yet another batting record on Friday as he became the fastest to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket as captain and only the sixth overall to achieve the feat.</p>
      <p>Kohli needed 32 runs to reach the milestone before the start of the two-match series against Bangladesh. He broke the record set by Australia legend Ricky Ponting on day 1 of the ongoing second Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Ponting had taken 54 matches (97 innings) to set the record, which Kohli broke in his 53<sup>rd</sup> match (86<sup>th</sup> innings) as India captain.</p>

      <p>Kohli is also the only Indian to breach the 5000-run mark as captain. If he manages to get to triple figures in this series then he will overtake Ponting again to grab the second spot on the list of captains with most hundreds in the longest format.</p>

      <p>Both Kohli and Ponting are currently tied on 19 centuries as skipper on the list which is headed by Graeme Smith, who had hit 25 tons as South Africa captain.</p>
      <p>But the India captain wasn’t the only cricketer to break a record in the ongoing Test. Ishant Sharma became the 1<sup>st</sup> Indian bowler to pick up a 5-wicket haul in Day-night Tests as the lanky pacer dished out a superb performance with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma dominated a splendid performance by Indian pacers to bowl out Bangladesh for a paltry106 on the opening day of the landmark Day-night Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma (5/22) claimed five wickets, Umesh Yadav (3/29) snapped three while Mohammed Shami (2/36) took two.</p>
