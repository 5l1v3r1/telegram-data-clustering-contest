      <p>ITV's head of drama, Polly Hill, told The Sun's Bizarre TV column: "This starts with Nilsen's arrest and is looking at him through the eyes of the police officer trying to identify those he killed and deliver justice.</p>
      <p>"David Tennant is going to be brilliant as Nilsen and, with Daniel and Jason, this has an incredible cast."</p>
      <p>The project will also star Jason Watkins as Brian Masters, who wrote a book on the killer, and Daniel Mays as Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay.</p>
