      <h1>The Real Reason Gregg Rolie Left Journey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:03:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/journey/">Journey</a> co-founder <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/gregg-rolie/">Gregg Rolie</a> is attempting to dispel the myth that he quit the band because he was unhappy about <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/steve-perry/">Steve Perry</a>’s arrival.</p>
      <p>Rolie bowed out in 1980, three years after <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/steve-perry-first-journey-concert/">Perry arrived</a> – and just before the band reached their height of fame. Rolie said it has been difficult to share the real story of his departure because the false one is so prevalent on social media.</p>
      <p>“I left because I didn’t like my life anymore,” Rolie tells <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gregg-rolie-interview-journey-santana-ringo-starr-914277/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> in a new interview. “I’ve said this a million times and I know there’s people that say, ‘That’s not the reason.’ But I left because I was unhappy with what I was doing in my own life. I loved the management. I loved the music. I loved what we built. I just wasn’t happy, so I had to blow the horn on it and just stop it.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Everyone thinks it was because Perry came in and started singing all the leads. My God! Again, I was spread so thin with all these keyboards parts and singing leads, he was a welcome sight to me. And he could sing like a bird! It wasn’t too hard to figure out. I was never against it.”</p>
      <p>Among his reasons for quitting was that he was drinking too much, and that he wanted to start a family, he explained. “And by the way, my family was my best work,” Rolie added. “It truly is. My son and daughter, my wife, it’s extraordinary. I did the right thing, but it just doesn’t play well with the guys on Facebook.”</p>
      <p>Rolie also said that he had no problem with the fact that Journey got bigger after he moved on. “I felt very proud that I helped to build something that went to that extreme,” he reported. “I’ve always felt that way. Yeah, without me doing this, that might never have happened. But it’s not about me. It’s about all of it. It’s a misconception in this business of, ‘Who does what?’ We all did something.”</p>
      <p>Steve Perry’s arrival heralded a new approach to songwriting for the band, and Rolie said it was a good change of direction. “There was a jam thing with it, but then it got more congruent and more about the vocals and harmonies,” Rolie recalled. “I’d never done that. I found it very appealing. As a matter of fact, to this day, I use those ideas with my own music. It’s maybe not as strong or as many harmonies and triples and all that stuff, but it’s the same attitude. I learned a lot about writing music from Journey and its … journey.”</p>

      <h3>The Best Song on Every Journey Album</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Journey' (1975): "Of a Lifetime"</h4>
      <p>Journey's recorded output begins here, with a seven-minute jazz fusion-influenced, at times <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/pink-floyd/">Pink Floyd</a>-ish excursion that boldly stepped away from Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon's previous work in <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/santana/">Santana</a>. "Talking about Santana screws up the whole concept of everyone in this band," Rolie lamented in <i>Don't Stop Believin'</i>. "A lot of people would come to see us and expect conga drums. The last thing I was to see for the rest of my life is conga drums!"</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Look Into the Future' (1976): "You're on Your Own"</h4>
      <p>Their slow-fast approach gives "You're on Your Own" a noticeably modern feel; Rolie's heartfelt singing centers it all.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Next' (1977): "Here We Are"</h4>
      <p>Perhaps Journey's heaviest-ever pop song. Rolie had a knack for <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-beatles/">Beatles</a>que touches (see their earlier cover of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/george-harrison/">George Harrison</a>'s "It's All Too Much"), even if it was buried in a cacophony of sound from Schon and Aynsley Dunbar (see their earlier cover etc. etc.).</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Infinity' (1978): "Feeling That Way / Anytime"</h4>
      <p>These paired songs took a convoluted path, as everyone reworked both halves into a legacy-defining moment for Journey and their new singer. "Feeling That Way" began as a Rolie track called "Velvet Curtain" then evolved into "Let Me Stay," which was considered for <i>Next</i>. When Steve Perry arrived, he added a gliding new chorus, and they were halfway there. Meanwhile, the Robert Fleischman co-written "Anytime" – released as a separate, No. 83-charting single but forever linked on the album and rock radio – was going nowhere. At one point, Journey almost dropped it altogether. Then Schon decided to tap the music of his childhood by adding a Beatles-sounding lyric, "Anytime that you want me." The then-new mixture of Perry and Rolie's voices did the rest. "As soon as the vocals were put in, the song came alive," Rolie <a href="http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/07/17/gimme-five-neal-schon-gregg-rolie-steve-smith-on-journeys-send-her-my-love-anytime-ill-be-alright-others/">remembered in 2014</a>, laughing. "I'm glad we didn't can it!" The results meld every great thing about their earthy first era with the pop-facing second era to come. In that way, it's not just the best song on <i>Infinity.</i> "Feeling That Way / Anytime" is the perfect Journey moment.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Evolution' (1979): "Just the Same Way"</h4>
      <p>Built off a Rolie piano riff, "Just the Same Way" once again leveraged Journey's layered harmony vocals, already a trademark of producer Roy Thomas Baker from his previous work with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/queen/">Queen</a>. Baker achieved this effect by having Perry and Rolie double and triple their parts, an incredibly time-consuming new approach that had already almost derailed "Anytime." (Rolie and Schon still considered themselves jam guys at this point.) But that's what ultimately gave this song – and Journey themselves – such a striking propulsion.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Departure' (1980): "Any Way You Want It"</h4>
      <p>Perry said the vocal and guitar interplay on "Any Way You Want It" was inspired by the performances of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/phil-lynott/">Phil Lynott</a>, after <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/thin-lizzy/">Thin Lizzy</a> opened for Journey. "I loved his ability and phrasing," Perry revealed in <i>Open Arms: The Steve Perry Anthology</i>. "This guy is one of the more under-recognized geniuses of that era." Perry and Rolie brought a tight focus to the bursts of shared vocals that close things out, fashioning Journey's second-ever Top 40 hit.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Escape' (1981): "Don't Stop Believin'"</h4>
      <p>It difficult to believe, considering how rightfully ubiquitous this anthem has become, but "Don't Stop Believin'" originally only barely cracked the Top 10. What's up with that, 1981?</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/9-Journey-Send-Her-My-Love-Single.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Frontiers' (1983): "Send Her My Love"</h4>
      <p>One of four Top 40 hits found on this album, the lonesome No. 23 anthem "Send Her My Love" is notable for an ambient turn by Schon (he used a high-end Lexicon 480L echo unit) and perhaps the most intriguing drumming contribution on Journey's string of familiar ballads from Steve Smith. A jazz lover who later founded his own combo, Smith added a slyly involving polyrhythm lifted from Miles Davis' "In a Silent Way." "The drummer on that was Tony Williams," Smith <a href="http://somethingelsereviews.com/2011/07/21/one-track-mind-steve-smith-on-songs-with-journey-jean-luc-ponty-vital-information/">said in 2011</a>, "and he played quarter notes with a cross-stick on the snare drum — a very hypnotic groove." Same here.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Raised on Radio' (1986): "Girl Can't Help It"</h4>
      <p>Perry essentially took control of Journey in the run-up to this project, switching out band members for sidemen with whom he'd worked before, then serving as the project's de facto producer. That led them to some song treatments that moved well away from anything Journey had done before, or since. "Girl Can't Help It," one of three Top 40 singles from <i>Raised on Radio</i>, was the exception. This was classic Journey, spit-shined up for a new era.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Trial by Fire' (1996): "Forever in Blue"</h4>
      <p>As with "Girl Can't Help It," from their most recent album with Perry, "Forever in Blue" represents that rare moment when the latter-day edition puts it all together again.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/12-Journey-Arrival-Album-Cover.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Arrival' (2001): "We Will Meet Again"</h4>
      <p>Deen Castronovo's inventively layered rhythm gives "We Will Meet Again" a distinct character among Journey's more anthemic-leaning tunes, setting the stage for a moment of controlled fury from Perry successor Steve Augeri. It all builds toward a sweeping vista reminiscent of Journey's Roy Thomas Baker-helmed sides like "Winds of March" and "Opened the Door," a welcome development indeed. And as with those two 1978 tracks, "We Will Meet Again" serves as an emotionally resonant side-closing moment.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Generations' (2005): "Faith in the Heartland"</h4>
      <p>The urge to return to an everyday working-stiff theme has been almost unavoidable for a group that, in no small way, is best remembered for "Don't Stop Believin.'" And yet "Heartland" never slips into tribute – or, worse still, parody. Credit goes most of all to Augeri, who strikes a visceral pose on upbeat tracks like this one, singing every line as if his whole heart is in it. Unfortunately, <i>Generations</i> went nowhere, and Augeri – citing throat problems – was gone after just two albums with Journey.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/14-Revelation-Journey-Album-Cover.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Revelation' (2008): "Where Did I Lose Your Love"</h4>
      <p>Here is Arnel Pineda's version of the familiar arena-ballad Journey sound, which is, on one level, very much in the style of their <i>Escape / Frontiers</i> era. Castronovo and Jonathan Cain, who co-wrote this track with Schon, even close things out with a fierce entanglement that must have brought older fans right back to "Separate Ways." But Pineda adds a few new wrinkles along the way to ultimately move past the same old Perry comparisons.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/15-Journey-Eclipse-Album.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Eclipse' (2011): "Edge of the Moment"</h4>
      <p>Castronovo and Ross Valory create a foundation-rattling rhythm, while the big-voiced Pineda ably conveys a fiery sense of sensuality required by the song's narrative. But "Edge of the Moment" will always belong to Neal Schon, who is by turns melodic, out there, gurgling, eruptive – and nothing like we've heard from him since the days of the spaceman 'fro. Long after their hit single-making days, and a couple of albums into Pineda's tenure, Journey finally found their rock-music mojo again on this track, emerging with a sense of furious third-act abandon.</p>
