      <p>Women have found "crude, personal and highly sexual" notes left on their cars after they parked at a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a> station.</p>
      <p>Twice the "disturbing" notes were left with gifts including lollipops and handfuls of Quality Street chocolates.</p>
      <p>Police are now appealing for information about the notes, which have caused the young women "an understandable amount of concern".</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/british-transport-police">British Transport Police</a> said: "Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two young women found a series of disturbing notes and gifts on their cars in Yate station, Gloucestershire.</p>
      <p>"Over a two week period between 30 October and 13 November, both victims parked their cars in the morning at the station and on three separate occasions returned in the evening to find disturbing notes left on the windscreens of their cars.</p>
      <p>"The six notes were all of a crude, personal and highly sexual nature, causing the young women an understandable amount of concern.Â On two occasions, lollipops and handfuls of Quality Street chocolates were left with the notes.</p>
      <p>"Officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen anyone leaving notes or behaving suspiciously in the car park of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/yate">Yate station</a> during this time period to get in touch with them.</p>
      <p>"Anyone with information can contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 655 of 01/11/2019."</p>
