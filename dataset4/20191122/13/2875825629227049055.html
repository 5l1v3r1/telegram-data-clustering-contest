      <p>Fans of The Young Offenders can rejoice as it has today been confirmed that the hit comedy show will be getting a third series.</p>
      <p>Loveable teen troublemakers Conor and Jock are set to return to screens for more of their unruly antics in their native <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork">Cork</a> in the new year.</p>
      <p>The coming of age series which stars Alex Murphy, Chris Walley and Hilary Rose has been commissioned by the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> for a third season, the broadcaster today announced.</p>
      <p>Show creator Peter Foott revealed that extra episodes for the third season had been filmed back-to-back with season two.</p>
      <p>Foott said he was "thrilled" that The Young Offenders  would be returning and that they "had a lot of fun" shooting the two seasons over the summer in Cork.</p>

      <p>He said: "We can't wait for everyone to see more of Conor, Jock, Mairead and all the characters next year in our third series.  We've been really amazed at the huge reaction to series two so far, and we're so happy that we can officially announce that there's more on the way for fans of the show."</p>
      <p>It's no surprise that the comedy series which also airs on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rte">RTE</a> Two is getting another series considering the success it has seen.</p>
      <p>Over 370,000 viewers tuned into RTE for the first episode of season two upon the show's return earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Kate Daughton, Head of BBC Comedy, said: “Young Offenders is spit-your-tea out funny and heartbreakingly emotional.</p>
      <p>Daughton hailed the "passion" of the "very special cast, crew and writing team," saying that the broadcaster "can't wait" to share season three with fans.</p>
