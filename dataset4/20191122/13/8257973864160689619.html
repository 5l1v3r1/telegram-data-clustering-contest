      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Will Ferrell told Jimmy Fallon on <i>The Tonight Show </i>that their famous<i> More Cowbell </i>sketch from <i>Saturday Night Live</i> ruined Christopher Walken's life.</p>
      <p>The sketch, from 2000, featured Walken as a famous music producer that keeps asking Ferrell to keep adding more cowbell to a song that is being recorded.</p>
      <p>Ferrell said on Thursday that years after the sketch, he visited Walken after the actor had performed in a play.</p>
      <p>"I say hello to him backstage and he's like, 'You know, you've ruined my life,'" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8kIzOr6DP8">Ferrell said</a> before he started to mimic Walken</p>
      <p>"'People during the curtain call bring cowbells and ring them. The other day I went for an Italian food lunch and the waiter asked if I wanted more cowbell,'" the comedian continued</p>
      <p>"From <i>The Deer Hunter</i>, to <i>Pulp Fiction</i> to 'More Cowbell.' That's all he gets now," the 52-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Ferrell also played a round of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A97alStXuQA">Whisper Challenge</a> with Fallon with the pair taking turns trying to guess what each person is saying while wearing noise-canceling headphones.</p>
      <p>Ferrell went off-script and gave long stories instead of reading off one phrase. The film star also knew beforehand what phrase Fallon was going to read while he wore the headphones.</p>
