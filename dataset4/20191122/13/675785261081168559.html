      <h2>Jose Mourinho has received a word of advice from legendary former Man Utd boss Sir Alex Ferguson after taking over the Tottenham managerial role</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:41:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:41</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has advised Jose Mourinho he has nothing to lose by playing Tottenham's youngsters.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has come in for criticism in the past - including at United - for failing to successfully bring through young players into the first-team.</p>
      <p>He praised the young players he will have at his disposal at Spurs in his first interview since joining the club, stating that he "really likes" their squad.</p>
      <p>He added: “Looking to the young players, there is not one manager in the world that doesn’t like to play young players and to help young players develop. There is not one."</p>
      <p>And Ferguson, who successfully brought through the famed Class of 92 to provide the backbone of his remarkable Old Trafford success, has advised Mourinho to follow through on his plan.</p>

      <p>Ferguson told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/633202/sir-alex-ferguson-jose-mourinho-tottenham-academy/">talkSPORT</a> : “The thing about young people is, if you give them an opportunity, not only do they seize it, they never let you down.</p>
      <p>“They have enthusiasm to do well.</p>
      <p>“If we go back to the young lads of ‘92, you give them an opportunity to play for Man United in front of 75,000 and they don’t want to miss that.</p>

      <p>“And they all did very well, and they’re also very good human beings.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho appeared to take a swipe at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and United for failing to produce academy players ready for the highest level during his time there.</p>
      <p>“The problem is that sometimes you get into clubs where the work that is below you is not good enough to produce these players," he said.</p>
      <p>"So I look to our history and you see that the academy is always giving the talents that the first team need."</p>
      <p>But he did bring through Scott McTominay at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , with the Scot going on to become a crucial player under successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
