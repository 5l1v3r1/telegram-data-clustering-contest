      <h1>Haulage association insists Verona Murphy is "someone who strives to avoid division"</h1>

        <b>The Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) has defended Verona Murphy, insisting she's someone who "strives to avoid division".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Fine Gael candidate in Wexford has stood aside as president of the organisation for the duration of the by-election campaign.</p>
      <p>The past week has seen the businesswoman come under fire for comments she made about asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>She has apologised twice for the comments, but has <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/martin-immigration-fine-gael-927448">faced continuing criticism</a></b> in recent days.</p>
      <p>Separately, the IRHA today said it has asked Ms Murphy not to comment on allegations about a settlementÂ they had concluded with a former employee of the the association.</p>
      <p>It comes after the <b><a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/fine-gael-in-dark-on-bullying-case-against-besieged-candidate-verona-murphy-38712323.html"><i>Irish Independent</i> reported</a></b> the settlement followed a Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) finding that the staff member was penalised for raising concerns of alleged bullying by Ms Murphy and others.</p>
      <p>The IRHA said the settlement "contained a strict confidentiality clause which the IRHA must respect".</p>
      <h3>'Person of integrity'</h3>
      <p>In their statement today, the management committee of the IRHA also said they wish to express 'solidarity and support' for Ms Murphy amid the ongoing criticism of her recent comments.</p>
      <p>They insist she has been 'extraordinarily dedicated' to her role in the association over the past four years.</p>
      <p>They said: "She has devoted time and energy way above anything that could be expected of a voluntary position.</p>
      <p>"At all times, she has shown compassion and concern for the problems encountered by every member who has sought her counsel and assistance."</p>
      <p>The statement adds: "The descriptions or terms being applied to Verona by some commentators do not represent or reflect the person that she is, the person that we know.</p>
      <p>"Verona is person of integrity, a person who is warm, generous, kind and strives to be a force for good.</p>
      <blockquote>"She is someone who strives to avoid division and seeks to bring people together.</blockquote>
      <p>"A person who, like everyone, is fallible, but knows when to put her hand up and acknowledge that she has made a mistake."</p>
