        <p>To explore the money making mystery in this film, we illustrate with a real-world transaction. Grilled meat in various forms is a worldwide delicacy. Known as Suya in West Africa, the value is in the taste. In order to experience the taste, you have to pay for it. If you will, the seller of the Suya is sacrificing the grilled beef/chicken/ram meat to you for a price, usually N100 to N250 or more for a rolled pack in newspapers depending on where you but it. Simple, straightforward transaction which applies to virtually everything with value that can be measured in units of currency.</p>

          <b>So who pays the Occult for their sacrifices?</b>

          <p>Keeping the Suya example in mind, let's switch to the business model of the Occult. In the movie, actor Ramsey Nouah (who made his Directorial debut with this film) is a wealthy business man by day, and leader of a sinister occult (made up entirely of men) named <i>"The six"</i> by night. Membership of the six requires giving up the life of a loved one in exchange for wealth. So here we have the same scenario with the Suya but here lies the critical question; who pays the occult for the souls they sacrifice?</p>
          <p>
            <b>Does the money for souls appear from thin air?</b>

              <b>Buying Suya in 5 steps</b>
            </p>

              <li>Pull out money</li>
              <li>Hand the money over to the Suya seller</li>
              <li>Receive Suya in exchange</li>
              <li>Enjoy your Suya while the seller enjoys your money</li>
            </ol>

            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Offer sacrifice to.......unknown</li>
              <li>Unknown receives body/soul in an unknown chamber</li>
              <li>Unknown pulls money out of.......somewhere.....</li>
              <li>Money from mysterious source is given to Ramsey Nouah's character</li>
              <li>He buys a Porsche and Private Jet to entice more people to get hooked on his monetary gifts so he can get more sacrifices</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <b>This goes beyond a fictional movie, people believe profitable Occults are real</b>
            </p>
            <p>Millions (possibly billions) of earthlings around the globe believe lives can be exchanged for money. Looking at the Slavery model, humans were sold in exchange for money but it was based on manual labor. The money paid for a slave was done in anticipation of the output of their manual labor yielding returns. The Spirit world of the occult seems to work differently.</p>

              <b>Closing questions</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Why do spirits pay physical money for souls?</li>
              <li>Why don't spirits give something spiritual in exchange for the souls they receive?</li>
              <li>Where do the spirits get their money and where do they keep it?</li>
              <li>How much does one soul cost and has it kept up with inflation and the Naira/Dollar exchange rate?</li>
            </ul>
