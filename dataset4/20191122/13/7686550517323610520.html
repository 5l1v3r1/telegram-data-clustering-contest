        <figcaption>Here's how you can fall asleep in a minute</figcaption>

      <p>Being caught sleeping at work is usually a fast-track to being told off or fired (unless your job is being a mattress tester) but many believe it could actually be beneficial.</p>
      <p>The idea is being talked about because the US government is cracking down on napping in the workplace as time is wasted and productivity is lost.</p>
      <p>However, experts argue that more productivity is lost through workers being tired during office hours and suggest a change in workplace culture is desperately needed.</p>
      <p>Is sleeping in the workplace something to be cracked down on, or should it be encouraged to promote a healthier culture?</p>
      <h3>The Claim</h3>
      <p>Several experts believe offering people places to sleep at work <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50396297">would actually be beneficial for productivity in the long term.</a></p>
      <p>Lots of people aren't getting enough sleep, meaning they are tired at work and therefore far less productive. A lack of sleep also makes a person more susceptible to illness that would keep them away from work for longer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/30/is-lack-of-sleep-affecting-your-work/">Tired people are less communicative, less focused, more easily distracted and have a harder time remembering important information.</a> Wouldn't it be better for them to get a little bit of sleep and perform better for the rest of the day than struggle to stay awake?</p>
      <p>Some countries have a strong culture of sleeping at work, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38498488">sleeping in meetings in Japan is seen as a sign of a hard worker.</a> Some workers even reportedly pretend to be asleep to look like they've been busy (and potentially listen in on colleagues).</p>
      <p>Longer commutes, an increase in working unpaid hours and an increase in businesses providing services 24 hours a day has contributed to an increase in people missing out on sleep.</p>
      <p>More time in the day is dedicated to work and the commute meaning there's less time for everything else. That can't be good.</p>
      <h3>The Counter Claim</h3>
      <p>Some workplaces intending to build a more "modern" culture have special rooms for employees to nap in, but the number of employers providing a place for their workers to sleep is very low.</p>
      <p>If sleeping at work is going to become the new normal it will take a very long time for us to get there. Changing workplace cultures is a long and arduous process.</p>
      <p>Besides, some countries with a more deeply ingrained culture of napping at work have found it's a double-edged sword. As mentioned before, some Japanese workers sleep in their office but <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a2289d48-d944-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8">the country is also suffering from a culture of overwork.</a></p>
      <p>If there's a discussion over whether employees need to have the option of napping at work then shouldn't the real question be whether they're being worked too hard in the first place?</p>
      <p>Letting employees nap at work doesn't tackle the issues which are contributing to people not getting enough sleep in their lives, it just treats a symptom of an unhealthy working culture.</p>
      <h3>The Facts</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4125e528-04f5-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">Financial Times</a> reports the UK loses around 200,000 working days every year due to poor sleep, costing the country Â£30 billion annually in lost productivity.</p>
      <p>Adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night, with serious health penalties for those who don't get enough. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/why-lack-of-sleep-is-bad-for-your-health/">The NHS</a> recommends aiming for eight hours a night as a good balance between sleep, work and free time.</p>
      <p>A lack of sleep is associated with weight gain, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is also linked to mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and depression.</p>
      <p>People naturally feel tired at around 2am and 2pm in the day, so if you're struggling to stay awake in that afternoon meeting there's a biological reason for that. Health experts suggest the ideal time to sleep at work would be between 2pm and 4pm.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Perspecs is a free app that curates the top news stories from a variety of established regional, national and international news sources. Unlike traditional aggregators and news curation services, Perspecs goes a step further and offers readers 3 polarised opinions of the same story.</p>
      <p>How these opinions are categorised can vary. For political stories this could be in the form of 'left', 'background', 'right'. For review items the categories could be 'negative', 'neutral', 'positive'.</p>
      <p>Readers often stick to their regular sources of news therefore often only ever seeing one side of a story. Perspecs will give you the opportunity to see things from a different perspective and allow you to form your own informed opinion.</p>
      <p>Perspecs will publish 1 edition per day and each edition will be packed with a variety of interesting and sometimes controversial topics. Most importantly, there will be three sides to every story.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/perspecs-news/id1049805082?mt=8">Download on the Apple App store</a>

      <p>They also suggest employees struggling to get enough sleep should try and break themselves into a routine with more time allocated for sleep.</p>
      <p>They recommend starting at the weekend, sleeping when tired and waking up naturally with no alarm clocks. After several weeks of going to bed earlier and waking up naturally they expect a person's sleep patterns to be much improved.</p>
      <p>Health problems are particularly bad for people working night shifts, with around 3.2 million Brits in such a situation. Their risk of injury at work is between 25 and 30 per cent higher than those on the day shift and the World Health Organization has described working nights as "probably carcinogenic".</p>
      <p>A third of Brits suffer from insomnia, meaning lack of sleep is a big issue for plenty of people in the workplace. As our understanding of people's health in the workplace develops further the idea of popping off for a quick nap might be more readily accepted.</p>
