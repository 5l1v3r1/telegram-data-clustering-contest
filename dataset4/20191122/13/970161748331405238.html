      <p>A heavily pregnant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> woman was violently punched in the head and stomped on by a stranger while sitting in a cafe in Australia.</p>
      <p>The woman, 31, had been having coffee with friends in Bay Vista cafe, on Church Street, Parramatta, New South Wales, when a man approached their table around 10.30pm on November 20.</p>
      <p>He allegedly screamed ‘Muslims raped my mum’, before lunging across the table and punching her in the head while other customers desperately tried to pull him back.</p>

      <p>Security footage shows the woman, who is 38 weeks pregnant, fall to the ground, with the attacker then beginning to stomp on her before he is dragged away.</p>
      <p>Stipe Lozina, 43, has been charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in connection with the Islamophobic attack.</p>

      <p>He has since been remanded into custody and will appear in court on December 5.</p>
      <p>The victim, from Sydney, has chosen to remain anonymous, but thanked Australia for their support through a statement shared by a friend.</p>
      <p>She wrote that she had experienced racism and ‘occurrences of verbal abuse and hate’ in the past, but ‘never thought that physical abuse of this nature’ would happen to her.</p>
      <p>It was also noted that she is a ‘private person’ but felt the need to speak out to address a few issues and ‘raise awareness’.</p>
      <p>The woman added: ‘I hope the justice system lives up to its name. I fear for the world our children will grow up in if this is not addressed.</p>

      <p>‘I call all Australians, Muslim and non-Muslim, to stand together in protecting innocent people from any racial or religious attacks.’</p>
      <p>The victim told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">The Telegraph</a> through a Muslim community leader, that the attack had left her feeling ‘very fragile’ and in shock.</p>

      <p>She was taken to Westmead Hospital for observation and an assessment of her unborn child and released the next day, having suffered a number of bruises and swelling.</p>
      <p>NSW Police Inspector Luke Sywenkyj told reporters in Sydney the victim seemed ‘somewhat emotionally and physically traumatised’.</p>
      <p>He noted that the woman did not know her attacker, but said he was known to police and had an extensive criminal record.</p>

      <p>Magistrate Tim Keady refused Lozina bail, telling him: ‘After making a comment about Muslims, you approached her and punched her to the head 14 times.</p>
      <p>‘For bail purposes I will treat that as a very strong case against you.’</p>
