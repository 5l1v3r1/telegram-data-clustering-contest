      <p>The police in Rajasthan’s Alwar district ordered nine Muslim members of the force to shave their beards, only to withdraw its instructions a day later.</p>
      <p>The original order on Thursday said the nine policemen were asked to cut their beards so that they acted and looked unbiased.</p>
      <p>As the news got out, on Friday Alwar Superintendent of Police Anil Paris Deshmukh withdrew his own order.</p>
      <p>Police said they had earlier given permission to 32 Muslim personnel to sport beards. Thursday’s order withdrew this permission for nine of them.</p>
      <p>The remaining 23 policemen were allowed to continue with their beards, police said.</p>
      <p>"Policemen should not only work in an unbiased manner but they should also look unbiased," the SP initially told reporters.</p>
      <p>"There is a provision of the state government which allows the HoD (head of department) to permit policemen to keep beards, he said.</p>
      <p>Under the provision, 32 policemen were given permission. The permission for nine policemen has been cancelled while for the rest of them it stands unchanged," he added.</p>
      <p>Deshmukh had said the decision can be reconsidered and those dissatisfied with it can approach the department.</p>
      <p>On Friday, while withdrawing the order, he said, It was an administrative order which has been withdrawn after representation from the aggrieved policemen.</p>
      <p>The permission to sport a beard has been given, he said.</p>
