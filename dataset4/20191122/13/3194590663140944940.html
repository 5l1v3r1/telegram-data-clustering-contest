        <b>Timi Dakolo, Nigerian gospel singer, has put out his much-anticipated album entitled ‘Merry Christmas Darling’ — ahead of the 2019 Yuletide season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 11-track body of work, which was released on Friday, features Emeli Sande, British singer and songwriter, and comes shortly after the 38-year-old award-winning musician had put out ‘<b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/download-timi-dakolo-emeli-sande-team-up-for-merry-christmas-darling/">Merry Christmas Darling</a></b>‘, the lead track off the project.</p>
      <p>The album also comes not long after the singer <b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/timi-dakolo-signs-record-deal-with-virgin-emi/">signed a record deal</a></b> with Virgin EMI, a subsidiary label under the Universal Music Group (UMG).</p>

      <p>Dakolo had embarked on a mission to limelight after he emerged winner of the inaugural season of Idols West Africa in 2007. With his victory, he also got a recording contract with Sony BMG alongside other prizes.</p>
      <p>He had started singing in church at the age of twelve. He also joined the singing group Purple Love as a founding member in 2003. The group later disbanded in 2005.</p>
      <p>In recent times, the singer has been embroiled in a <b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/tag/coza-rape-scandal/">heated legal battle</a></b> with Biodun Fatoyinbo, senior pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) church after Busola, his wife, alleged that the clergyman raped her on two occasions as a teenager.</p>
