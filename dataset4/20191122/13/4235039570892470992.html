      <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has urged investors to invest more in <b>Turkey</b>, pointing out that the country's financial problems are already over, Hürriyet Daily News reported, quoted by BNR.</p>
      <p>We scatter the dark clouds over our country, reducing our inflation to single digits and quickly reducing interest rates. "I hope that 2020 will be a year in which interest rates will go down even more," Erdogan said in a speech.</p>
      <p>“We are lowering and will lower interest rates to single digits in the shortest period,”</p>
      <p>"I call on foreign companies. Come and invest / in <b>Turkey</b> /. I call on every industry, regardless of sector. Come and invest / in <b>Turkey</b> /. Our banks' doors are now open to you and interest rates are quite clear", he said.</p>
      <p>Erdogan said <b>Turkey</b> is taking steps in the economy by using its own currency instead of accumulating foreign currency liabilities.</p>
