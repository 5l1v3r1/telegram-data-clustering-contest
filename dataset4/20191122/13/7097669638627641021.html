      <h1>‘Impeach the f*****’: Live TV call-in halted after man demands Trump’s removal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:45:50+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Colin Drury</a></address>
      <p>It was a TV phone-in offering viewers the chance to have their say on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> – and Monty from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Florida">Florida</a> took full advantage.</p>
      <p>Producers on America’s C-Span network may have already been regretting opening up the lines after a series of rowdy callers offered partisan views on the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/united-states">US</a> president’s ongoing impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>But they presumably thought things would be safe with Monty, a self-evidently polite and articulate gentleman.</p>
      <p>“Howdy,” he said as a live camera feed showed viewers scenes from a break in the House Intelligence Committee hearing. “I just want to apologise, first and foremost, for all the morons on the calls earlier, especially from Alabama.”</p>
      <p>A pause. “Secondly,” he continued, “I just want to say impeach the f*****. Have a great day!”</p>
      <p>After a split second of silence, the unseen anchor styled out the pre-watershed outburst with little more than a weary note of resignation.</p>
      <p>“Thanks, Monty in Florida,” he says cheerfully. “That’s it for our phone calls right now.”</p>
      <p>The call, though blue, echoed the words of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Michigan">Michigan</a> congresswoman <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rashida-tlaib">Rashida Tlaib</a>,</p>
      <p>Shortly after being sworn in in January, the Democrat recalled a conversation with her young son in which she told him: “Baby ... we’re gonna go in there and we’re going to impeach the motherf*****.”</p>
      <p>The impeachment itself is currently reaching a crucial stage with several key witnesses testifying that Mr Trump publicly pushed a fictional narrative with regards to his contentious dealings with Ukraine.</p>
