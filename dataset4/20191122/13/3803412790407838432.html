      <p>These days, it seems that we have an account for everything online, and then some. With so many bank accounts, bills, subscription services, social media logins, work-related accounts, and more, it's important to have a strong and secure password. And not only that, but having a unique strong and secure password for <i>everything</i>. We can't stress that enough â€” <b>never use the same password for multiple accounts</b>, as it increases potential risk if someone ever happens to get a hold of your info.</p>
      <p>But we get it, remembering a billion different combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters is pretty much impossible. Fortunately, there are password management apps designed to help you keep your digital data safe and secure on the Mac, and most of these also have mobile counterparts to simplify your life.</p>

      <p>1Password is one of the most popular password manager apps out there, and it's the one I use personally on a daily basis. It's available on every platform you can think of, and it has a huge set of useful features in a nice interface.</p>
      <p>With 1Password, you're able to store your login details, bank account information, credit cards, ID cards, email accounts, secure notes, and pretty much anything else you can think of. It has a convenient password generator to help you create randomized passwords to use, and the Watchtower feature lets you know when a password has been reused, has been in use for a long time, or even when a site may be compromised, so you should update your password info.</p>
      <p>1Password is free to download, but you will want to grab a subscription to the get the most out of the service. It starts at $3 a month for an individual account, or you can even get a Family account for just $5 a month so everyone is protected.</p>

      <p>A popular alternative to 1Password is LastPass, which is also a free download with plenty of great features in a simplified design.</p>
      <p>With LastPass, you're able to store all of your usernames and passwords in a vault, and sync them across all of your devices for free. If you have a lot of passwords to go through, you can quickly search for what you need, and LastPass automatically fills in your credentials when you need them. There's a password generator, ability to create secure notes and add attachments too, encryption, and more.</p>
      <p>There is a subscription service for LastPass for families and premium users, which includes Emergency Access, so trusted friends and family can access your information in an emergency. A subscription also has other features like unlimited sharing, 1GB of file storage, and more. The subscription costs $24 a year.</p>

      <p>One thing that all of the apps we've mentioned so far have is that they all need a subscription to get the most out of them. But what if you just want a completely free password manager? Look no further than EnPass.</p>
      <p>You can store anything in EnPass, such as your login credentials, bank account information, email accounts, secure notes, and more, without any restrictions. There is also a strong password generator and password audit, which lets you know if your passwords are weak, mediocre, or strong. EnPass automatically locks itself when not in use and you can sync your data across multiple devices. Everything in EnPass is stored locally, and never uploaded to an online server.</p>

      <p>Tired of subscription services but want a premium app that can handle more than a free option? Then pwSafe - Password Safe is the one you should try out.</p>
      <p>The thing that sets pwSafe apart from others is the fact that it is a one-time purchase, and there are no in-app purchases after that. So you spend less than $20 to get the app, and then it's yours forever, at least, until the next major version if they decide to charge for it.</p>
      <p>With pwSafe, you get simple and secure password management for all of your login credentials, bank accounts, credit cards, emails, secure notes, and more. There's a password generator for making those random passwords, and it can fill out the forms you need it to. You can have multiple safes, unlimited saved items, unlimited fields per item, iCloud sync, and more. There is also the option to print out a hardcopy of the items you need, giving you a complete safeguard in case anything happens (store it away in a safety box or something). If you prefer to use a service like Dropbox for backups, that option is in Password Safe too.</p>
      <p>Password Safe is a good option to consider if you just want a one-time price on an app with a premium experience.</p>
