      <h2>A third of the flats planned for Halton 5 are smaller than the government's recommended minimum standard for housing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:07:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/christopher-mckeon/" target="_blank">Christopher McKeon</a></address>
      <p>A former council office block could be converted into 170 flats, but a third of them would be smaller than the government’s recommended minimum standard.</p>
      <p>Doncaster-based Empire Property Concepts has applied to turn the largely vacant Halton 5 office complex, next to ShoppingCity <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/runcorn">Runcorn</a> , into one- and two-bed flats.</p>
      <p>But plans submitted to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/halton-council">Halton Council</a> last week show that many of the proposed flats would fall short of the minimum floor space standards recommended by the government.</p>
      <p>The standards state new one-bed flats should have at least 37m <sup>2</sup> of floor space while two-bed flats should have at least 61m <sup>2</sup> .</p>
      <p>However, 30 of the proposed 118 one-bed flats and 26 of the proposed 42 two-bed flats at Halton 5 do not meet this standard.</p>
      <p>If the developers intend each bedroom to be occupied by two people, then none of the flats would meet the minimum standards, which are higher for flats meant to be occupied by more people.</p>
      <p>The standards, introduced in 2015, are not legally binding but provide a reference for local authorities that wish to incorporate space standards into their planning policies.</p>

      <p>Nor does the size of the flats provide grounds for the council to refuse the planning application.</p>
      <p>Conversions of offices into flats can only be blocked on a limited number of grounds and a report prepared for Halton Council’s development control committee suggest that none of them apply in this case.</p>
      <p>The application will be discussed by the committee on December 2, but officers have recommended delegating the final decision to the head of planning as the consultation will not yet be over but there is no other committee meeting planned before a decision must be made.</p>
      <p>The 1970s block, formerly known as Grosvenor House, used to be occupied by Halton Council but in recent years has stood mostly empty.</p>
      <p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/in-your-area/grosvenor-house-flats-conversion-approved-9055454">a different developer was given permission to convert part of the building</a> into 64 flats, but the work was not carried out.</p>
      <p>Empire Property Concepts was approached for comment but did not reply by time of publication.</p>
