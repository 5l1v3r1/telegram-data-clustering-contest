      <h1>Gold Technical Analysis: Remains vulnerable to retest monthly lows, around $1445 area</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:19:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/haresh-menghani" target="_blank">Haresh Menghani</a></address>

          <b>Gold regains some traction but remains well within a familiar trading range.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bulls need to make it through 100-DMA before aiming towards $1500 mark.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Barring a couple of knee-jerk spikes, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> has been oscillating well within a range over the past one week or so and remained capped below the 100-day SMA. The range-bound trading action constituted towards the formation of a rectangle on hourly charts, which is usually seen a continuation pattern that forms during a pause in the trend.<br/> <br/>Given the recent pullback from multi-year tops and a subsequent break below 100-day SMA, the set-up remains in favour of bearish traders. This coupled with the fact that the commodity has been trending lower along a two-month-old descending trend-channel further points to a well-established downtrend and reinforces the bearish bias.<br/> <br/>Moreover, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> have struggled to recover from the negative territory and reinforce prospects for an extension of the recent pullback from multi-year tops. Hence, some follow-through weakness, towards $1457-55 support zone en-route monthly swing lows around the $1445 region, remains a distinct possibility.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, immediate <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> is pegged near the $1481-82 region (100-DMA), above which the commodity is likely to head back towards reclaiming the key $1500 psychological mark before eventually aiming to challenge a resistance marked by the top end of the mentioned trend-channel, currently near the $1509-10 region.</p>
