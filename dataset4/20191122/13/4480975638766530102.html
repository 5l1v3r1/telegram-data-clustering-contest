      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Retail Sales</a> in Canada decreased for the first time since June, losing 0.1% to $51.6 billion, the monthly data published by Statistics Canada showed on Friday. </p>
      <p>"The decline came from lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations. Excluding these two subsectors, retail sales rose 0.7%," the publication read. "After removing the effects of price changes, retail sales in volume terms decreased 0.1%."</p>
      <p>With the initial market reaction, the CAD gathered strength against its peers and dragged the USD/CAD pair to 1.3250 area. </p>
