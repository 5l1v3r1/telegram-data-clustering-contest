      <h1>South Lanarkshire councillor warns about a 'Grenfell two' happening in Blantyre</h1>
      <h2>Plans for the proposed Blantyre care hub were compared to Grenfell Tower.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:07:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Bark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stephen-bark/</a></address>
      <p>Plans for the proposed Blantyre care hub were compared to Grenfell Tower at a council meeting last week.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Council’s housing and technical resources committee were warned against a “Grenfell two” if a fire was to break out at the proposed hub.</p>
      <p>Councillor Allan Falconer (Hamilton West and Earnock) made the comments after officers said people with “complex care needs” could be housed in third floor flats if the proposals are approved.</p>
      <p>In June 2017, 72 people were killed after a fire broke out in Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, London.</p>
      <p>The committee had been discussing the council’s Strategic Housing Investment Plan (SHIP) for 2020 to 2025 on Wednesday, November 13.</p>
      <p>An update to the Home+ Programme contained within the report said that “the council continues to use the affordable housing programme to increase the supply of specialist housing to meet particular needs”.</p>
      <p>Cllr Falconer queried this in relation to the proposed Blantyre hub adding that the planning application notice in the Hamilton Advertiser had “no mention of the 20 homes for people with complex care needs”.</p>
      <p>Chair of the committee Cllr Josh Wilson (Hamilton South) confirmed that the proposed 45 council homes – including 20 for people with complex care needs – at the former St Joseph’s Primary were included in the SHIP.</p>
      <p>Executive director for housing and technical resources, Daniel Lowe, added that the housing department had “worked really closely with social work” on the plans.</p>
      <p>The 45 council homes would be a mix of single, two and three-storey buildings.</p>
      <p>Deputy leader of the Labour group, Cllr Gerry Convery (East Kilbride Central South) said: “People with complex care needs as high as three storeys, what happens if there is a fire?</p>
      <p>“They would need to be carried down three flights of stairs.”</p>
      <p>Mr Lowe confirmed that people with complex care needs are housed in an appropriate home for their needs and that a complex care need wasn’t necessarily a “complex physical need”.</p>
      <p>The SHIP, which was approved by the committee, includes plans to build 3,141 new council homes across South Lanarkshire by 2025, including 1000 by 2021.</p>
      <p>That includes 977 in Hamilton, 957 in East Kilbride, 821 in Rutherglen and Cambuslang, 176 in Clydesdale and 210 in various locations.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire’s SHIP is a five year rolling plan which will change as new sites become available and others are found to unviable.</p>
