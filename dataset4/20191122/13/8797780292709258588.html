      <p>If Megas XLR taught me anything, it’s that giant robots sell. <i>You </i>dig giant robots. <i>I </i>dig giant robots. <i>Chicks </i>dig giant robots. It’s something that has been missing for far too long in video games, and while Daemon X Machina may have scratched my itch for robotic mayhem, it wasn’t the mechanised topical ointment that I craved for my highly specific rash.</p>
      <p>After twenty years, a new Mechwarrior game aims to change that. Called Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries, the latest chapter in the ancient franchise looks like <i>exactly </i>the kind of robot game I’ve been waiting for. Absolute units of mass destruction, gigantic mechanical marvels stomping around the battlefield and unleashing volleys of ultra devastation on anything that gets in their way.</p>
      <p>It’l be out on December 10 as an Epic Games Store exclusive, but until then here’s a new trailer! In it you’ll find a TLDR guide to Mechwarrior, that details the basic gameplay, keeping your mechs in tip-top fighting shape and how every building around you happens to be made out of wet cardboard whenever you pop up. Delightful stuff:</p>

      <blockquote>Take a look at the upcoming MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries. Take missions, make money, upgrade your Mechs and dominate the battlefield!</blockquote>
      <p>Oh my yes. My big hope with Mechwarrior 5 is that it makes it mechanised battles games of violent chess. Mechwarrior at its best was a game where battles weren’t over in seconds as if they were some sort of Power Ranger showdown. They were slow and surgical, where you sacrificed an arm to ensure that your opponent went down for the count. If Mechwarrior 5 can restore that feeling of piloting 200 tons of awesome, then I’m down for a return to the world of that scrappy robo-brawler.</p>
