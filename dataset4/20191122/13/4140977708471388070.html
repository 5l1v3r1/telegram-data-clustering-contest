                        <i>“When Zidane calls you, it is serious. Honestly, that is something, he has this power over me. He did not do my head in in the middle of the Euros.</i>

                      <p>

                            <p><i>“After the 2018 World Cup, I had wanted to come,”</i> he said. <i>“The bosses at Chelsea said no. I had to do one year with Sarri and I didn’t want to leave Chelsea on bad terms. I tried to do my best.”</i></p>

                              <i>“I passed six great years. The third year, with Mourinho, was more complicated. I played bad matches but there were good seasons and consistency. And I left as one of the best in the world, recognised as such by the others.</i>
