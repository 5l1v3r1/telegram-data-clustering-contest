      <h1>Scottish Junior Cup: Irvine Meadow's injury worries mount ahead of Glenafton tie</h1>
      <h2>But boss Brian McGinty insists he still has enough to win fourth round clash.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:35:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>Brian McGinty insists he won’t use injuries as an excuse if Irvine Meadow crash out the Scottish Junior cup at home to Glenafton this weekend.</p>
      <p>Meadow will be without several key players for the fourth round clash as they look to stay in the competition beyond Christmas.</p>
      <p>Defensive duo Darren Miller and Jared Willet are certain to miss the match while striker Eddie McTernan is a major doubt.</p>
      <p>Miller is struggling to shake off an ankle problem while Willet and McTernan picked up fresh injuries in Saturday’s 4-1 league defeat at Largs.</p>
      <p>McGinty is already without long-term injury absentees Ben Carson, Jordan McGuire and Graham Boyd but believes he still has enough within the ranks to see off Glens.</p>
      <p>“These guys are a huge loss for us, especially with the games coming thick and fast over the next month or so,” said McGinty.</p>
      <p>“But as I’ve always said, we’ve no superstars in this squad. I know whoever comes into the team can do a job for us.</p>
      <p>“It’s up to me to pick the right team and if we play like I know we can, at 100 per cent with real intensity, then I always feel we can beat anyone.”</p>
      <p>Glenafton head to Meadow Park on a high after hammering Auchinleck Talbot 3-0.</p>

      <p>McGinty insists the Loch Park outfit, who won the competition in 2017, are favourites on paper.</p>
      <p>But he’s a firm believer in the form book going out the window for the cup.</p>
      <p>He added: “Glenafton have some excellent players. For me they are one of the top three teams in the West.</p>
      <p>“Most of their boys have cup winners medals and they are very experienced.</p>
      <p>“They come into the game flying while we haven’t really played well for a couple of weeks now, despite picking up a fairly good run of results.</p>
      <p>“That’ll all count for nothing on Saturday though. The players know if they don’t turn up we’ll be out the cup and nothing can be rectified.</p>
      <p>“We want to win this competition and to do that we have to still be in it after Christmas.”</p>
