      <h1>Former Labor minister Eddie Obeid granted parole after three years behind bars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:28:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/emma-elsworthy/" target="_blank">Emma Elsworthy</a></address>
      <p>The NSW State Parole Authority (SPA) has granted parole to disgraced former NSW Labor minister Eddie Obeid after a private meeting.</p>
      <p>The decision means Obeid, 76, could be released from prison as early as December 14.</p>
      <p>He was in 2016 convicted of misconduct in public office and jailed for five years, with a minimum non-parole period of three years.</p>
      <p>Obeid’s conviction came after he failed to disclose his family’s business interests in cafe leases at Sydney’s Circular Quay.</p>
      <p>Obeid was also lobbying a senior bureaucrat about the rights of waterfront retailers in 2007 when he was a member of the NSW Upper House.</p>
      <p>He served as a NSW MLC from 1991 to 2011.</p>
      <p>He was Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Mineral Resources before retiring in early 2011 due to family reasons.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors decided to act following a 2014 investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into Obeid’s secret stake in cafes through his brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>The ICAC found Obeid acted corruptly and “misused his position as an MP” by encouraging the leases not be put to competitive tender.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the SPA said Obeid had “demonstrated satisfactory prison performance”.</p>
      <p>The SPA also took into account Obeid’s age and the fact it was his first incarceration.</p>
      <p>Obeid’s parole conditions stipulate he must not “engage in any activity paid or unpaid involving the control of money or assets of other people or organisations”.</p>
      <p>He is also required to alert a community corrections officer if he changes his address, contact details or employment during his parole.</p>
      <p>Obeid is not permitted to leave the state or country without permission from the authorities.</p>
