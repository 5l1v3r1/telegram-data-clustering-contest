      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:26:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:26</time> by <a rel="author">Giles Blair, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/giles-blair/</a></address>
      <p>IF YOU know someone who loves their car to be their pride and joy then the latest Haynes manual is the ideal Christmas present.</p>
      <p>Car Hacks, by Craig Stewart, is packed with practical and affordable tips to make the car and the whole motoring experience more enjoyable.</p>
      <p>The advice covers every aspect, from sprucing up the interior and exterior to travel and storage hacks to make longer journeys with the family a joy rather than a chore.</p>
      <p>In typical Haynes fashion, many of the tips are written in an easy-to-understand, step-by-step format, allowing anyone to upgrade their vehicle to improve their daily motoring life.</p>
      <p>So among the 126 tricks in the compact book, you can find out how to top up your engine oil without spilling a drop, stop annoying rattles from door bins and avoid your car becoming damp and musty in the cold.</p>

      <p>Other great ideas include using nail polish to fix paint chips and turning to hand sanitiser to de-ice keyholes, as well as a host of tips to maximise your car’s life and fuel economy.</p>
      <p>To keep the kids entertained, you can find out how to create tablet device holders for the back of the front seat headrests or turn magnetic sketch toys into table trays.</p>
      <p>The book also has some ingenious storage solutions as well as a section on ways to modernise your car, such as creating a wi-fi hotspot or installing interior LED lighting.</p>
      <p>Author Craig Stewart has worked on a variety of enthusiasts’ magazines and websites and is an acknowledged expert when it comes to car hacks.</p>
      <p>He said: “We spend more time in our cars than we do socialising, but car interiors aren’t designed to meet the individual’s specific needs and this can be very frustrating for both the driver and passengers.</p>

      <p>“Car Hacks provides some simple ways to create the vehicle you actually need, from adding power sockets and storage where you need them to eradicating annoying rattles.</p>
      <p>“This manual is not about corner-cutting, it’s about how to use the things around your home to improve both your car life and your wellbeing in the process. The book not only takes care of the issues to fix in the vehicle but it also looks at driving enjoyment, offering practical advice on how to avoid road rage.</p>
      <p>“There is also a joy in car hacking, finding little tricks where you thought issues might be impossible or too expensive to fix or repair. Everything can feel so stressful nowadays but having a vehicle should be about freedom and being on the open road. </p>
      <p>“I hope that the book will reignite that feeling of escapism, and make being in the car for long periods of time a bit easier and more fun for the whole family, especially with holiday season coming up.”</p>
      <p>Car Hacks is available now from <a href="https://haynes.com/en-gb/">www.haynes.com</a> priced at £12.99.</p>
