      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:03:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/manoj-kumar-r/" target="_blank">Manoj Kumar R</a></address>
      <p>Telugu actor <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mahesh-babu/">Mahesh Babu</a> on Friday released the teaser of his upcoming film Sarileru Neekevvaru, which is Telugu for ‘you are peerless.’ The teaser opens with a heavy punchline from Mahesh, who is playing the role of Major Ajay Krishan. He delivers the dialogue with his usual I-am-a-serious-guy bass tone, which is interrupted by his sudden switch to sarcasm.</p>
      <p>Judging by the teaser, it is safe to assume that after showing a taste of hell to the local thugs with his fist, Ajay Krishan tries to reasons with them. “We (read Indian army) sacrifice lives at borders to protect you. And you here attack women. Shouldn’t you behave more responsibility?” asks Ajay.</p>
      <p>Mahesh Babu is playing the role of an army officer for the first time in his career. And he seems to have not done much homework to play the role differently. He seems to have brought his usual cock-sure fella with a heart of gold and nerves of steel act to the table again. And as we have seen in previous films, he is again after the life of Prakash Raj.</p>
      <p>From the looks of it, Prakash Raj is playing a corrupt politician, who is challenged by an uncompromising army officer. We also get a glimpse of Vijayashanti, who is making a comeback to the big screen after a gap of 13 years.</p>
      <p>The teaser also hints at several over-the-top action sequences meant to meet the approval of the core fan base of the Tollywood superstar.</p>

      <p>Written and directed by Anil Ravipudi, Sarileru Neekevvaru will release on January 11, instead of January 12 as announced earlier. The Producers Guild of Telugu Cinema on Friday released a statement taking the credit for advancing the release date of the film.</p>
      <p>“Yet another time, the Producers Guild of Telugu cinema has diligently exercised their responsibility of maintaining harmony within the film industry,” read the statement.</p>
      <p>After last averting the clash between Gang Leader and Gaddalakonda Ganesh, they have now successfully managed to do the same for the upcoming major releases Sarileru Neekevvaru and Ala Vaikunthapuramlo. Both the films were scheduled for release on January 12. The members of the Guild intervened to ensure both the films get good revenues. After speaking to producers of both the films, Anil Sunkara and Chinna Babu, the Guild convinced the duo to release Sarileru Nekavvaru on January 11 and Ala Vaikunthapuramlo on January 12.</p>
