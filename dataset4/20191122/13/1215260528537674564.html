        <b>The administration at the Pembroke Hall High School in St Andrew has launched a high-level probe into an incident in which a teacher threatened a child with violence yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident was captured on video and is being circulated through social media.</p>
      <p>Mi wi kill you in yah bwoy,” the teacher told the student.</p>
      <p>She was reprimanding him for talking out of turn.</p>
      <p>

      <p>In response, the student raised his voice at the teacher, further infuriating her.</p>
      <p>“Weh yah shout after mi fah? Mi look like you mumma?” she asked the boy.</p>
      <p>The boy retorted, asking the teacher, why was she telling him about his mother.</p>
      <p>This angered the teacher, who suggested that the student was handicapped and senseless.</p>
      <p>“Did the teacher tell you bout yuh mumma a while ago likkle bwoy?” she asked. “Mi wi mash up you face inna dis!”</p>
      <p>
        <b>'MI HEAD NUH NICE'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The enraged teacher would continue in a tirade for another minute, telling the child: “Yuh nuh have nuh sense, nuh come in yah, cause mi nuh play wid pickney.”</p>
      <p>Eventually, the teacher, saying, “mi head nuh nice”, chased the child out of the classroom.</p>
      <p>“First of all mi mash up pickney head in here,” she said. "Mi wi murder you inna dis."</p>
      <p>The boy, on leaving the classroom told the teacher that she was threatening him.</p>
      <p>"That's a promise! Go tell the police that," she replied.</p>
      <p>This morning, Principal Reverend Claude Ellis denounced the teacher’s behaviour saying an immediate probe has been launched.</p>
      <p>Ellis said, as part of the probe, the teacher has been asked to provide a written statement accounting for what happened.</p>
      <p>He said the written report is due this morning.</p>
      <p>According to the principal, the school board chairman and the acting chief education officer have also been advised about the incident.</p>
      <p>“We will handle the matter,” Ellis sought to assure, adding that once statements are collected, the matter will be turned over to the board for action to be taken.</p>
      <p>He has also responded to allegations that the teacher has had a history of inappropriate behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Since I have been at Pembroke Hall for the past two and a half years, this is the first time I’m dealing with a matter of this nature,” he said.</p>
