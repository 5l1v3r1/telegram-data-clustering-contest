      <h1>Prince Andrew steps down from Pitch@Palace role</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:33:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-cook/" target="_blank">James Cook</a></address>
      <p>The Duke of York has stepped down from his role at the start-up competition Pitch@Palace. The event will now continue without any royal involvement, sources said.</p>
      <p>The series of events will now be known simply as “Pitch” and will continue to be run by the Duke’s former private secretary Amanda Thirsk.</p>
      <p>The competition has now dropped a requirement in its legal terms that entitled the Duke and his company to a stake in the technology businesses which enter the competition <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-refuses-give-pitchpalace-emerges-can-take-cut/">following an investigation by The Telegraph</a>.</p>
      <p>One entrepreneur said earlier this week that it was “absurd beyond belief” that the company could take such a cut and it was “scandalous” that the terms were buried on the final page of the application process.</p>
      <p>A clause in the event's application terms which gave the Duke the ability to claim 2pc of technology businesses was deleted from the Pitch@Palace website on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Royal sources said yesterday the Duke would continue to be allowed to host events “on a commercial basis” at palaces and to maintain his private office at Buckingham Palace. They said Pitch@Palace would move to his “private portfolio”.</p>
      <p>However, the Duke has now stepped down from the helm of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/19/prince-andrew-sponsors-call-step-pet-project-salvage-reputation/">the scheme he founded in 2014 following pressure from sponsors</a>.</p>
      <p>Backers including KPMG, Standard Chartered and Bosch have already pulled out of funding the enterprise.</p>
      <p>Last night, the Duke cancelled a planned trip to Bahrain for a Pitch@Palace event amid the furore.</p>
      <p>Ms Thirsk, the Duke of York’s private secretary who took the blame for persuading him to record the disastrous Newsnight interview, was informed on Thursday night that her role had been abolished.</p>
      <p>It’s understood that Ms Thirsk, a former banker who began working with the Duke in 2004, will continue to run the rebranded “Pitch” event series.</p>
