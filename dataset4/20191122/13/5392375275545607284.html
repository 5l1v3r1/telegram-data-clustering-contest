      <p><a href="https://report.counterpointresearch.com/posts/report_view/IndustryBeats/1561">Counterpoint Research</a> released a report for India’s online smartphone market performance in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>As the report showcases, due to a few factors such as festivals, India’s online smartphone market sold 46% of all shipped smartphones in the country in the third quarter. This is a new record in this market’s history.</p>

      <p>The top three online channels in India are Flipkart, Amazon India, and Xiaomi India Online Mall. This quarter, Flipkart’s sales reached $1 billion, accounting for 57% of the market. Amazon India’s shipments were increased by 75% compared with the same period last year. And now, it has a market share of 33%. Interestingly, India’s Xiaomi online store share reached 9%, ranking third.</p>
      <p>And though Xiaomi’s online channel ranks third, this brand still <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/08/16/idc-report-xiaomi-still-lead-the-indian-smartphone-market-for-q2-2019/">continues leading</a> the overall smartphone market in the country. Its market share is as large as 38%. Another Chines brand Realme ranks second. It was 4.5 times higher than in the same period last year. Samsung ranked third due to its new M-series phones. The fourth place is occupied by VIVO. But the latter also ranked first in the low-end smartphone market. Surprisingly, OnePlus ranked fifth. As you should know, this brand designs only top-end models. India is considered to have many customers with low income. So initially it was assumed high-end smartphones won’t succeed here. But the high-end market in India grew by 79% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>As you see, there are many Chinese brands. And Samsung is fighting against them alone. But where is Huawei?</p>
