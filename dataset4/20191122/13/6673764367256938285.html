      <p><b>OSAKA – </b>Reigning world champions Uta Abe and Joshiro Maruyama missed their chance to become the first Japanese judoka to secure a spot at next summer’s Tokyo Olympics after losing in the finals at the Osaka Grand Slam on Friday.</p>
      <p>Abe lost to France’s Amandine Buchard in extra time in the women’s 52-kg division on the opening day of the three-day meet at Maruzen Intec Arena Osaka.</p>
      <p>In the men’s 66-kg division, Maruyama fell to Abe’s brother Hifumi, who scored a yusei victory during extra time to claim his fourth title. The all-Japanese clash was a rematch of their world championship semifinal in Tokyo in August.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t strong enough,” Maruyama said. “No matter how you cut it, a loss is a loss.”</p>
      <p>The All Japan Judo Federation has announced that judoka winning both the worlds and the Osaka Grand Slam could book tickets to the Olympics if approved by two-thirds of the federation’s development committee officials.</p>
      <p>Akira Sone has a chance to earn an Olympic berth if she wins the women’s over-78 kg later in the meet. The 19-year-old, with three gold medals from the last two world championships, including two in the mixed team event, is looking to compete in her first Olympics.</p>
      <p>Among other Japanese competitors, Rio de Janeiro Olympic bronze medalist Naohisa Takato claimed his fifth title in the men’s 60 kg by beating countryman Ryuju Nagayama.</p>
      <p>Funa Tonaki and Momo Tamaoki won gold in the women’s 48 kg and 57 kg, respectively.</p>
