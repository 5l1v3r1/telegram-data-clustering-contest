      <p>US President Donald Trump appeared to misspeak during an interview with Fox News Friday morning, telling the network: "I do want corruption, always," while discussing the ongoing impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Speaking on "Fox and Friends," Trump was discussing testimony from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union.</p>
      <p>He made the slip while attempting to lay out his defense for seeking an investigation by Ukrainian authorities into Joe Biden: what he says is his genuine desire to root out domestic corruption in Ukraine.</p>

      <p>During testimony Sondland alleged that Trump wanted to dangle a high-profile White House visit for Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid in exchange for the investigation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/impeachment?r=US&amp;IR=T">Trump has consistently maintained that in seeking a Biden probe</a> he was simply asking Ukraine to tackle longstanding corruption, and the decision to freeze the military aid was a "quid pro quo" to pressure Ukraine to meet his demands.</p>
      <p>Twitter users were quick to seize on the mistake, suggesting a Freudian slip from the president.</p>
      <p>One was Danny Wessel, a comms expert for the Democratic National Committee:</p>

      <p>Others joined in, either to read into the president remarks, or simply observe the apparent mistake:</p>
