      <p>A hedge fund manager nicknamed the "Wizard of Oz" is crushing the broader market. </p>
      <p>Greg Coffey's Kirkoswald Asset Management has soared 29% year-to-date through October, according to Bloomberg, which cited an investor letter. That figure is 8 percentage points higher than <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">S&amp;P 500</a>'s gain of 21% during the same period. </p>
      <p>Kirkoswald is a macro fund that makes bets on broad economic trends. The firm — which focuses on emerging markets — is outperforming peers this year that are struggling with historically low interest rates and a growing mountain of negative-yielding debt, Bloomberg found. </p>
      <p>Further, the fund's returns are about five times the average of similar firms tracked by a Bloomberg Index. </p>
      <p>Coffey previously retired at 41 after being mentored by hedge fund legend Louis Bacon, who is planning to close his firm <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/louis-bacon-reportedly-plans-to-close-moore-capital-hedge-fund-2019-11-1028708814?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Moore Capital Management</a> to outside investors, according to a report from earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Bacon's protégé <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/louis-bacon-to-back-greg-coffeys-kirkoswald-hedge-fund-2018-4?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">spent time</a> at both Moore and GLG Partners overseeing emerging-market funds. According to a 2012 <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/greg-coffey-behind-the-curtain-20121106">Financial News report,</a> Bacon once described Coffey as "the most impressive trader" he's ever seen. </p>
      <p>The investor reemerged from retirement in 2018 to launch a big comeback with his own macro-focused hedge fund, and it appears to be working. </p>
      <p>Kirkoswald raised about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greg-coffey-kirkoswald-capital-2019-ytd-returns-through-may-2019-6?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">$1 billion</a> in capital at launch in April of last year. The firm got off to promising start earlier this year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greg-coffey-kirkoswald-capital-2019-ytd-returns-through-may-2019-6?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">returning about 6.9%</a> year-to-date through May as the average macro fund manager gained 2.7% during the same period, according to Hedge Fund Research data. </p>
      <p>A representative from Kirkoswald did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
