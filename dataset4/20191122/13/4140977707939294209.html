          </p>
          <p>When you have managed to squirm your way to a singular win in the five matches you have contested in, you know you don’t stand a chance of making it into the ensuing round of the T10 league. And that’s exactly where this horrid and horrendous Karnataka Tuskers side find themselves with the team slumping into the trenches of the points tally, failing to impress with their despondent brand of cricket.</p>
          <p>The side have been berated and besmirched for the sorry performances they have doled out this edition of the showpiece league with the side finding themselves in 8th place after having played the five matches. The side were routed and trounced by Qalandars yesterday to receive their third defeat, a 32 run defeat which was vindicate of the horrendous cricket they have played this time around.</p>

                <p>Needing 131 to win, the Tuskers ended up losing 9 wickets as they managed to string together a mere 98 runs from their 10 overs. And when they play against Team Abu Dhabi today, the side will be looking to bring down the curtains on their campaign with a fruitful result, one which shows that the side are more than just the mere pushovers they have come across as.</p>
                <p>And in Team Abu Dhabi, they have an opponent who they know they can get past if they imbed some semblance n their performance come today. Their opponents have had a tournamnet akin to them with just the one win from 5 matches seeing them languishing in sixth place. What does still keep the side in the hunt for a spot into the proceeding round is the rain lashed encounter which they endured against Deccan Gladiators with the truncated encounter handing them a crucial one point.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A sublime wicket to come out and bat on, the side winning the toss will be looking to step out and bat first with chasing under the lights being a tentative proposition. No side has won while chasing over here till now in the league and the team batting first know that anything close to 120 will more than enough to defend.</p>

                            <h3>KAT Vs TAB Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>At a time when nothing as gone right for Karnataka Tuskers, especially in the batting order, there has been one player who has managed to show valour and resolve to be held in reverence. It’s Johnson Charles with the side’s opener scoring 24 in a mere 9 balls yesterday, a knock which epitomised how vital a component he’s been of his side’s agonising batting contingent.</p>
                            <p>He will be accompanied by his side’s wicket-keeper, Shafiqullah Shafiq for this encounter with his counterpart managing to string together meaningful performances across his stay in the league.</p>
                            <h3>KAT Vs TAB Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Elvin Lewis comes in as well from Karnataka Tuskers whilst from the opposition we will be lining up our batting slot with a trio of picks, one which begins with Luke Wright. The bat has spared no expense in showing the stomach of a fight and regaling his side in some scintillating displays with the bat to show why he’s considered such a destructive bat in the shortest format of the game.</p>
                            <p>He will find company in the form of Avishka Fernando who got the 17 runs last time around in a match where Wright scored 23 while Wayne Madsen wraps up our selections from the setup after he top scored for the unit with 29 runs.</p>
                            <h3>KAT Vs TAB Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Moeen Ali has refused to come out and have a go with the ball but the player comes out to bat at an escalated spot to see us go in with him. He’s capable of lashing out at the ball and wielding his bat in fruition to peel off some boundaries to make him our choice for this one.</p>
                            <p>From Karnataka Tuskers meanwhile we have decided to divulge in Nathan Rimmington after he sent down the two overs for just seven runs yesterday. It was an imperious display with the ball, one which saw him mix up his deliver to leave batsmen flabbergasted as he cramped them up for room persistently.</p>
                            <h3>KAT Vs TAB Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>We begin with the picks from Team Abu Dhabi with a partnership of picks being selected from the side given the paper thin batting unit of the Tuskers which has been left doing little than picking up the pieces. Both their spearheads in the form of Ben Laughlin and Marchant de Lange are gotten in by us, two players whose wicket to wicket line and length is both to induce wickets at regular intervals.</p>
                            <p>From the other side of the facet meanwhile it’s just the one option for us with Kesrick Williams wrapping up our picks for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Wright has been selected to captain our Dream 11 unit for the day whilst Charles is the vice-captain.</p>
