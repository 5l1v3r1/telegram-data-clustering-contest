      <p>Like weekdays, weekends get in more eyeballs and viewership for the ongoing TV reality show Bigg Boss 13. While host Salman Khan is currently shooting for the Weekend Ka Vaar episode in Filmcity, social media, on the other hand, has started trending in support of Asim Riaz.  Housemate Asim, who is hitting the headlines for his continuous fallout with Sidharth Shukla, has clearly divided the social media into two halves. After hashtags such as #StayStrongSidharth, #<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-asim-riaz-pitted-as-top-contender-asimwinninghearts-trends-on-twitter/5dadce8787fb571eff7e2d25">AsimWinningHearts</a>, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-sidharth-shukla-and-asim-riaz-are-fighting-but-netizens-are-feeling-sorry-for-rashami-desai/5dd7978d0cada251e9c310d5">#StayStrongRashami</a>, netizens are back to supporting Asim.<br/><br/>As per the latest Twitter trend, netizens coming in support of Asim have got #NationWithAsim trending on the first position in India. Seems like, with his huge wave of Asim on Twitter, the contestant shall remain in the house, despite his ugly fallout with Sidharth Shukla, clearly tarnishing some of the rules of the Bigg Boss house. Asim’s fans on the social media platform tweeted, “Majority of BB fans knew #SidharthShukla from the beginning. The majority of BB fans didn't know who #AsimRiaz was. Asim has earned more respect in the last 50 days than what Shukla earned in his 10-15 years. In fact, Shukla has lost his good boy, gentelman image.” Check out more such Tweets below- ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-karanvir-bohra-speaks-up-in-favour-of-asim-riaz-says-don-t-get-family-and-religion-into-it/5dd7d7100cada251e9c31147">Bigg Boss 13: Karanvir Bohra Speaks Up In Favour Of Asim Riaz, Says 'Don't Get Family And Religion Into It'</a></p>
