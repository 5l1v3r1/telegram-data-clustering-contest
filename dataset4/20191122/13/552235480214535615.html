      <h1>Electric Morris JE will be a van-tastic icon of the future</h1>
      <h2>Our columnist John Curtis is smitten by the forthcoming Morris JE electric van – and he explains why here.</h2>

      <p>WHAT is the most ridiculous vehicle you have ever seriously considered buying?</p>
      <p>Over the years, I have played with the notion of buying a Lexus SC 430 and, in a similar design vein, the Diahatsu Copen. But my latest object of desire proves I am losing the plot. I adore the new Morris JE electric van.</p>
      <p>Based on the commercial van of the 1940s, the Morris J, the JE is a blast from the past sprinkled with the fairy dust of the present in the form of it being fully electric. Imagine a post-war grocery van meets the Duracell bunny and you get the idea. What is not to like?</p>
      <p>Well, at a price of £60,000, a prospective owner would need to have deep pockets lined with gold and it is possible to get a Tesla Model 3 and have enough change to buy a genuine 1950s van for that kind of money.</p>
      <p>But that somehow misses the point. In many ways, vehicle design has stagnated to the point that, unless you study every new launch, it is almost impossible to separate one new car from another without seeing the badges.</p>
      <p>There are, of course, exceptions but design is often overlooked due to the cost of production. Then into my life drives the Morris JE. I have only seen publicity shots from the launch but, goodness me, is that one sexy van.</p>
      <p>It has curves where vehicles should, evokes a memory of my childhood and countless black and white films, but delivers on performance. In line with more modern electric van designs, the JE has a 200-mile range, can carry a tonne and weighs in at 2.5 tonnes. It can charge to 80 per cent in 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>What this van has is class. This commercial vehicle will turn heads and capture the hearts and minds of potential customers. If you have a business with something to say, you could do a lot worse than shell out the necessary lolly.</p>
      <p>Sadly, the JE won’t be available to buy until late 2021. But be very sure that if I can find a way of justifying it to “she who must be obeyed”, I will.</p>
