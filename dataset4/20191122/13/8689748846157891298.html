      <h1>‘Do I Look Like Someone Who Can Be sacked?’– Maame Yeboah Asiedu Brags</h1>

      <p>One of the biggest faces who used to work with United Television (UTV), Maame Yeboah Asiedu has finally broken her silence on her unexpected departure from Despite Group of companies.</p>
      <p>The almost plus-size media guru left under a cloud of uncertainty which led to speculations that she was sacked.</p>
      <p>However, when she took her turn on the popular Delay show hosted by Deloris Frimpong Manso, Maame Yeboah Asiedu who also doubles as a counsellor said she was never sacked.</p>
      <p>According to her, no employer can sack because of her pedigree. She continued that the feat she has achieved in her life will make it impossible for any ‘boss’ to fire her.</p>
      <p>When Delay enquired from her if indeed she was fired as it was gathered from the grapevine, Maame Yeboah Asiedu came in with an answer that was shrouded in over confidence.</p>
      <p>“Me, sacked by UTV, for what? Me, I am too good to be sacked. Do I look like one of those they can sack?”, she bragged.</p>
      <p>She then added: “When you are a visionary and you know where you are going, you will not be distracted by hearsays.</p>
      <p>Obviously, at that time I was at my peak, I was the biggest on that TV, so when I left people never expected it, so if I’ve left, people will want to find reasons why I left.</p>
      <p>They may even speculate and wonder if I was sacked or not but the bosses themselves and my colleagues there know I was not sacked. I left, I was not sacked, I resigned”, she concluded.</p>
