      <p>Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said that Vande Bharat Express trains have become a hit and Indian Railways are aiming to introduce a new era of world-class train travel experience, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/railways/new-era-of-travel-delhi-varanasi-delhi-katra-vande-bharat-trains-a-big-hit-with-indian-railways-passengers/1771246/">report</a> <i>Financial Express.</i></p>
      <p>Vande Bharat Express has been well received by passengers with one train running between Delhi-Varanasi and the another between Delhi-Sri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the Railway Ministry informed that train number 22435/36 Delhi-Varanasi-Delhi Vande Bharat Express saw an occupancy of 115.71%, while train number 22439/40 Delhi-Sri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra-Delhi Vande Bharat Express saw an occupancy of 99.27%.</p>
      <p>The occupancy recorded by both these trains is inclusive of bookings done for en-route/intermediate stations.</p>
      <p>These ‘Make in India’ trains have made commuting between Delhi and Varanasi, Delhi and Katra very comfortable and travel time has come down to just 8 hours.</p>
      <p>Both trains are semi-high speed trains with modern facilities and amenities including European-style seats, modular toilets, on-board hotspot WiFi, GPS-based audio-visual passenger information system, LED lighting, automatic doors, etc.</p>
