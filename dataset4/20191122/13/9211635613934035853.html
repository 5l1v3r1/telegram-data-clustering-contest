      <p>The Design Museum has announced Anatomy of an AI System, a digital case study revealing the impact of the Amazon Echo, as the overall winner of the Beazley Designs of the Year 2019 competition.</p>
      <p>The annual competition celebrates innovation across six sectors, including digital, graphic and product design. As well as the overall winner, individual category awards have also been revealed.</p>

      <h3>Winning project</h3>
      <p>Anatomy of an AI System, nominated in the digital category, has been designed by AI and data researchers Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler.</p>
      <p>It is an “anatomical” case study of the Amazon Echo, investigating the human labour cost, data collection and environmental impact of the voice assistant system.</p>

      <p>Displayed as a graphic map, the project charts the life of Amazon’s device, from the manufacturing process through to its arrival in customers’ homes, signposting “issues” and “hazards” along the way.</p>
      <p>For example, at the assembly stage, the case study draws attention to issues around low paid labour as well as illegal working hours.</p>

      <p>The map’s focus-point is the “Amazon Data Center”, which illustrates how the internet company harvests data about users’ voice and behaviour patterns.</p>
      <p>This “quantification of human body, actions and behaviour” reveals how the device profiles individuals on issues ranging from school grades to social media use and medical testing.</p>
      <p>The map also analyses what happens to abandoned devices, and how both informal and formal waste collection of unwanted devices contributes to e-waste.</p>

      <h3>Product design</h3>
      <p>The winning project in the product design category is Catch, a self-testing device that detects HIV from British designer Hans Ramzan.</p>
      <p>The low-cost pocket-size device works by finger-pricking and allows users to self-test in the privacy of their own home. It aims to reduce stigma and encourage users to seek treatment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/27-august-2-september-2018/hiv-home-testing-kit-people-developing-countries/">Ramzan told Design Week</a> that Catch was inspired by his aunt’s death from a “life-threatening illness” and wanting to find a way self-diagnose so that they can seek treatment earlier.</p>

      <h3>Transport winner</h3>
      <p>A collaboration from Japanese lifestyle shop Muji and Finnish automobile company Sensible 4 wins the transport category. Gacha is a self-driving bus that works in a variety of weather<br/>conditions.</p>
      <p>Aimed at serving older people who can no longer drive, the bus — which has no defined front or back — is being trialled in three cities in Finland, with plans for the expanded roll-out in 2020.</p>

      <h3>Graphics</h3>
      <p>Pentagram’s work with David Chipperfield Architects on the Seoul headquarters of cosmetics company Amorepacific was awarded first place for graphic design.</p>
      <p>The signage combines letterforms, numerals and pictograms that refers to the environment; rivers, mountains, parks and the city.</p>
      <p>Pentagram also created a bespoke typeface for the project, Latin, in an attempt to create a consistency across three languages — English, Chinese and Korean — which have different letterforms.</p>

      <h3>Architecture, fashion and public choice awards</h3>
      <p>A school library in Mumbai, which has a curved roof that children can walk over, won the architecture prize. In the fashion category, a collection of Adidas streetwear inspired by Korean clothing from designer Ji Won Choi, took first prize.</p>
      <p>MySleeve — a silicone cover for crutch handles which aims to improve users’ sore hands and grip — won the public choice award.</p>
