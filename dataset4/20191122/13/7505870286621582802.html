      <h1>Walmart’s big pre-Black Friday sale has begun – here are the top 10 deals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:38:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Zach Epstein</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday 2019 has finally begun! Wait, no, it’s only November 22nd and Black Friday isn’t until November 29th. So, what on Earth is going on and why are there so many incredible Black Friday deals out there already? Well, it turns out that the explanation is pretty simple: retailers are offering so many deals for Black Friday 2019 that they couldn’t even manage to cram them all into one week. Instead, several retailers are kicking off their big Black Friday blowouts over a week early.</p>
      <p>The biggest early Black Friday 2019 sale is happening over on Amazon, and you’ll find all the top sales in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Friday?tag=b0c55-20"><b>Amazon’s massive Black Friday 2019 deals hub</b></a>. Of course, Amazon is hardly the only online retailer getting in on the action. Walmart kicked off an early Black Friday sale last night that’s simply called “Pre-Black Friday” (creative!), and it’s home to some truly impressive deals. Shop the full sale <a href="https://www.walmart.com/m/deals/christmas-gifts">right here</a>, and check out our picks for Walmart’s top 10 pre-Black Friday deals below.</p>
