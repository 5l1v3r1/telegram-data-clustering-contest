      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/migos/profile">Migos</a> have been relatively quiet this year but some of their affiliates have been putting in some work. YRN Murk has been on the rise for a minute and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/offset/profile">Offset</a> has been heavily promoting him on his Instagram page. Today, Murk dropped off his latest project, <i>Cranberry Porch</i>. Although none of the Migos make an appearance from it, he does link up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/playboicarti/profile">Playboi Carti</a> for the song, "What Type Of Shit You On." ChaseTheMoney handles the production with an eerie beat that feels like its emerging from a creaky door in bando. Murk effortlessly details the trap with a deadpan voice before Playboi Carti swings in with the baby voice.</p>
