      <p>WASHINGTON: The first comic book produced by Marvel, the famed US publisher behind Spider-Man, X-Men and The Avengers, went under the hammer Thursday (Nov 21), fetching a record US$1.26 million, Heritage Auctions said.</p>
      <p>"This is a historic copy of a historic comic book," Ed Jaster, auction house senior vice president, said of the book, which was published in 1939 by Timely Comics, which later became Marvel.</p>

      <p>"Without question, this is the granddaddy of all Marvel Comics, without which we would not have the characters and stories we enjoy in today's comics and feature films," Jaster added.</p>
      <p>Under the direction of screenwriter Stan Lee, Marvel in the 1960s created superheroes which have become iconic today and whose cinema adaptations have conquered box offices worldwide.</p>
      <p>The first copy of "Marvel Comics" was sold in very good condition and well above the price of 10 cents it fetched back in 1939.</p>
      <p>"Amazing Fantasy #15," in which Spider-Man first appears, slipped to second-highest Marvel comic ever auctioned, having sold for US$1.1 million in 2011.</p>
      <p>The most expensive comic book in history remains the first issue of "Action Comics" published in 1938 in which Superman makes his debut. It sold for US$3.2 million in 2014.</p>
