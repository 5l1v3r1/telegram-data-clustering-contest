      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:37:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>Highlife singer, Yaw Labito has revealed that Hiplife legend, Obrafour after <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/obrafours-old-friend-yaw-labito-fights-him-over-his-popular-odo-song/">refusing to feature him in his popular ‘Odo’ music video</a>, he also refused to help him travel to the UK for a better life even when his locked-up investment was with him and some other people.</p>
      <p>Yaw Labito recounting his sad experience with his friend revealed that after helping Obrafour record his song ‘Odo’, they became close friends thereafter where he asked Obraofur to support him with his album.</p>
      <p>In his narration on Sammy Flex Tv, he revealed that he asked Obrafour to help him with his album where he assured him of a man who will help him with it.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>“After recording my album (Br3br3), Obrafour took it to the UK to master it and later told me those in charge would love to buy the album. We agreed on an amount of GHc7,000(70 million old cedis).</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>“I was given GHC1,000 out of the GHC7,000 from one man in Kumasi.”</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><i><b>“I used the money because my rent and other things had to be paid for and I was virtually left with nothing,”</b></i> he said.</p>
      <p>He continued that they were then invited to a show in the UK but he couldn’t make the trip because he had no money to facilitate his plane ticket and other stuffs. The show went on without him and after 4 months, he decided to go to the UK since his 6 months visa was due to expire.</p>
      <p>He asked for money from Obrafour but he was declined and later went to former Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah to solicit for funds for his plane ticket so he can pay later on his return.</p>
      <p>The then Julius Debrah decided to help him with some money but was later told Obrafour had gone behind his back to convince Julius not to give him(Yaw Labito) the money because his(Julius Debrah) cash would be locked up if he doesn’t return.</p>
