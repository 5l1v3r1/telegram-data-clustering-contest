      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Glen Kamara has been liked with a move to the Premier League with Crystal Palace, Burnley and Brighton and Hove Albion all said to be interested</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:25:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Rangers manager Steven Gerrard has broken his silence on transfer speculation surrounding midfielder Glen Kamara - and says he is willing to offer him an improved contract.</p>
      <p>Kamara has been imperious since moving from Dundee in a bargain £50,000 move in January, with the 24-year-old attracting interest from Aston Villa and Leeds United because of his impressive string of performances.</p>
      <p>The Finland international is under contract until 2023, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/no-no-no-fans-react-17156720">but reports have suggested that Gerrard and his side are willing to thrash out</a> fresh terms to secure the former Arsenal trainee's Ibrox future.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> were linked with a move for Kamara in October, along with Leeds and Premier League trio Brighton and Hove Albion, Burnley and Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>Kamara has made 20 appearances for Rangers and has started the past two League matches - and Gerrard wants to reward the midfielder as long as he keeps his performance levels high.</p>
      <p>"We haven't heard of any interest down south, we've read tons about it though," said Gerrard.</p>
      <p>"But I wouldn't be surprised if there was interest in Glen Kamara because he's an outstanding footballer.</p>
      <p>"He's been outstanding since he walked in the door. Sometimes I still have to pinch myself for how we got him and what we got him for.</p>
      <p>"Glen is doing fine. He got a real strong contract when he came here from Dundee.</p>
      <p>"He's in good form and playing well. The message for Glen and the other players is we always reward our players for consistent performances over a long period of time. Glen will be treated no different.</p>
      <p>"All he needs to worry about is bringing success back to the club and I'm sure he will be well looked after."</p>
