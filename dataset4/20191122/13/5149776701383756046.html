      <h1>'Fragile' - Forest boss reveals what rest of season may hold for Man City loanee Aro Muric</h1>
      <h2>There are concerns goalkeeper's parent club could question his lack of game time at the City Ground and reassess his stay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:03:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi has praised goalkeeper <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/aro-muric">Arijanet Muric</a>’s “professional” attitude while he has been out of the team.</p>
      <p>But the head coach has hinted the youngster will find it tough to get back into the starting line-up in the near future.</p>
      <p>Muric started the campaign as the Reds’ No.1 after <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-aro-muric-transfer-3006533">joining on a season-long loan</a> from Manchester City, before some error-strewn performances saw him lose his place to the more experienced <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/brice-samba">Brice Samba</a>.</p>
      <p>It has left the 21-year-old as back-up shot-stopper on the bench, and some suggestions that his parent club might ask questions about his lack of game time come January.</p>
      <p>Asked if Muric could still have a part to play this term, Lamouchi said: “I am just focused on the situation now, and the situation now must stay like this because I think we have found the right way.</p>
      <p>“But we know it is so fragile, so you never know.</p>
      <p>“But he is doing his job. He is very positive in training sessions and is a nice guy.”</p>

      <p>Muric <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/support-guy-what-nottingham-forest-3545406">has been on international duty</a> during the two-week respite from Championship action, being between the posts for Kosovo in defeats to Czech Republic and England.</p>
      <p>And even though he may not be getting on the pitch for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a>, Lamouchi says he has not let it affect him in training.</p>
      <p>“He’s been good,” said the Frenchman. “He is a young goalkeeper, just 21 years old.</p>
      <p>“He played two games with his national team and has come back and trained with us.</p>
      <p>“He is a professional.”</p>
