        <b>A man who shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow has been found guilty of murder.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sana Muhammad was shot through the abdomen by Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo at her home in Ilford, east London, in November 2018.</p>
      <p>He hid in a shed in his ex-partner's garden armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad's son - her sixth child -was delivered by Caesarean section.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard Unmathallegadoo plotted the attack - buying two crossbows which were discovered near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018.</p>
      <p>After they were removed, he replaced the weapons and organised surveillance on the house in Applegarth Drive.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard the couple's relationship ended in 2012 and at the time of the attack, Unmathallegadoo was the subject of a court order which banned him from going within 100 metres of his ex's home.</p>

      <p>Mrs Muhammad's second husband Imtiaz told the court he was in the garden and thought he was "dreaming" when he saw the defendant step out of the shed with two crossbows.</p>
      <p>He shouted to his wife to run as Unmathallegadoo chased him into their home.</p>
      <p>"When she got an arrow she just screamed. I was thinking, 'what is happening?', I was screaming for her."</p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement he described her as "my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly.</p>
      <p>"Ram has finished everything. We all feel lost now", he said.</p>
      <p>Her mother Ellemah (Joytee) Sutharamandoo said the loss of her only child had had a "profound impact".</p>
      <p>"I lived for my daughter and my grandchildren.</p>
      <p>"I now feel alone, there are days I do not want to live."</p>

      <p>Unmathallegadoo had denied murder and claimed he went to the house to talk to Mr Muhammad about his daughter's religion.</p>
      <p>He told police Mr Muhammad was his target but that his ex-wife got in the way.</p>
      <p>But the prosecution said Unmathallegadoo had wanted to kill the couple and their unborn child.</p>
      <p>The court heard Unmathallegadoo's children tried to take the crossbow from him.</p>
      <p>Susan Krikler, from the CPS, said: "This was a cold-blooded and calculated execution.</p>
      <p>"This devastating attack has left six children without their mother."</p>

      <p>Unmathallegadoo trial in April was discharged after a juror raised an issue about the defendant's mental health despite the judge asking the jury not to speculate on the matter.</p>
