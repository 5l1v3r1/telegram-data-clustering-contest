      <p>A few drivers may have been in too much of a McHurry for food at Penticton's McDonalds, ending up in a three-car crash. </p>
      <p>Mid-morning Friday, some hungry travellers crashed into each other in the lineup for the drive-thru window. </p>
      <p>Penticton deputy fire chief Chris Forster confirmed crews responded to the incident, saying three cars were involved in the rear-enders. </p>
      <p>Nobody was hurt, and it is not known whether those drivers are still hungry. </p>
