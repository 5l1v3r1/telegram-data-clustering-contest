      <p>Analysts at Danske Bank provided a brief preview of the key events/releases, which could potentially move the market in the upcoming week.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Focus continues to be on US-China trade talks and the scope for a phase-one deal. We expect a deal to be reached over the next month but there have been reports that it could drag out further due to disagreements on tariff roll-back and Chinese agricultural purchases.”<br/> <br/>“On the data front, focus is on signs of a bottom in the global business cycle. US core durable goods orders and private consumption will help us gauge what Q4 GDP growth looks like. In <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> area the German IFO index is set to give clues whether German industry has passed the low point.”<br/> <br/>“We expect November euro area core inflation to be unchanged at 1.1%, while US core PCE inflation is expected to be unchanged at 1.7%.”<br/> <br/>“In Scandi focus turns to consumer and business surveys and Q3 GDP in Sweden as well as unemployment and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">retail sales</a> in Norway.”</p>
