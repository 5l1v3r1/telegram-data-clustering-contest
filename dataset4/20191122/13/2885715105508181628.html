      <h1>Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar calls for dialogue over para-teachers’ stir</h1>
      <h2>Over 1,000 para-teachers in Bengal, who are contractual teachers in government-run schools, are on a sit-in since November 11 and 37 of them are on an indefinite fast from Friday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>As the indefinite fast by para-teachers in West Bengal demanding a hike in their salary entered the eighth day on Friday, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar appealed to all sides to initiate a dialogue for resolving the issue.</p>
      <p>“@MamataOfficial. I appeal all sides for dialogue at the highest level as over 1000 para-teachers are on a sit-in since November 11 and 37 of them are on an indefinite fast from Friday,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Referring to the death of para-teacher Revati Raut in West Midnapore district on Thursday, Dhankhar tweeted, “Reported death of Revati Raut, in West Midnapore and illness of others worrisome.”</p>
      <p>Revati Raut, a middle-aged para-teacher who had taken part in the sit-in by para-teachers here for several days, died at her residence in West Midnapore’s Debra on Thursday, Bhagirath Ghosh, Co-Convenor of the ‘Para-Teacher Oikyo Manch’, the organisation which is spearheading the movement, had said. Over 1,000 para-teachers, who are contractual teachers in government-run schools, are on a sit-in since November 11.</p>
      <p>Altogether 37 of them are on an indefinite fast from Friday, with at least 10 falling sick, Ghosh said.</p>
      <p>He said there has been no word from the state government about ways to address their demands — hike in salary and pay parity with Group D employees. Para teachers at primary schools and high schools are paid a monthly salary of Rs 10,000 and Rs 13,000 respectively, which should be raised to Rs 22,000-25,000, Ghosh said.</p>
      <p>State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee had earlier said the para-teachers should show the urge to come for talks with the government.</p>
