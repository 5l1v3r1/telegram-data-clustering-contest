      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.49306/title.janelle-monaes-wondaland-pictures-inks-production-deal-with-universal-pictures">Janelle Monáe</a> is caught in a battle between the Antebellum Period and modern-day America in the trailer for the Gerard Bush-directed movie <i>Antebellum</i>.</p>
      <p>Produced by Sean McKittrick — who also produced the Jordan Peele-directed films, <i>Get Out</i> and <i>Us </i>— the film also stars Eric Lange, Jena Malone, Jack Huston, Kiersey Clemons and Gabourey Sidibe.</p>
      <p>The trailer for the horror-thriller was released by QC Entertainment and Lionsgate on Thursday (November 19). The sweet-yet-haunting score highlights the terror of slavery and the bliss of present day as the singer-actress plays both a slave and a single, working mom.</p>

      <p>Monáe joined production in March, marking her first lead role in a film. Over the past couple of years, she was cast in supporting roles for the Oscar-nominated film <i>Hidden Figures</i> and Academy Award-winning movie <i>Moonlight.</i></p>
      <p>Monáe shared the trailer on her own Twitter account earlier this week with the release date.</p>
      <p>“#Antebellum,” she captioned the post. “April 24, 2020.”</p>
