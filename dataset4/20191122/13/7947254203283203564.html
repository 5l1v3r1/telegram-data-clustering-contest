        <i>Tom Ford’s glittering crystal slippers are made for staying out long after midnight</i>
      </p>
      <p>A crystal slipper might traditionally come with a midnight curfew, but when it comes to <b>Tom Ford</b> there are no such rules – whether at his eponymous label, or at <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/Gucci">Gucci</a> and <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/yves-saint-laurent">Yves Saint Laurent</a> before, the <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/tom-ford">Tom Ford</a> woman has always come to life after-hours. (She is, after all – to borrow the name of a recent fragrance by the designer – <a href="https://www.tomford.co.uk/fucking-fabulous/T6-FABULOUS.html">Fucking Fabulous</a>.)</p>
      <p>That said, his Autumn/Winter 2019 collection – of which these crystal peep-toe platforms, alongside various jewel-toned iterations, were a part – saw the design temp his usual no-holds-barred glamour. If only somewhat: “I’ve never really been a designer who’s talked about a moment in time, how that’s influenced what I design. But you can’t escape the news,” Ford <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-ready-to-wear/tom-ford">said at the time</a>. “I feel frustrated and agitated and exhausted. And I don’t want to wear anything particularly challenging or anything particularly aggressive.” And so there were slouchy silk trousers, in berry and emerald and ruby, nipped-waist velvet jackets, roll-neck sweaters, leather puffer jackets – even the ubiquitous hoodie made an appearance (albeit worn with a perfectly cut, wide-shouldered satin trench).</p>
      <p>But, if all of this marked an exercise in restraint for the designer – a man who waged <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/8296/tom-fords-sexual-revolution-at-gucci-aw96">sexual revolution at Gucci</a> and is synonymous with the hedonistic glamour of the early aughts – then the footwear was proof he’s not going soft. The opposite: sky-high, and encrusted with 18,500 crystal rhinestones, these are heels made for going – and staying – out.</p>
