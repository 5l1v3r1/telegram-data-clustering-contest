      <h1>The Mandalorian Co-Creator Won't Rule Out a Boba Fett Appearance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:11:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Narayan Liu</a></address>
      <p>After a reshuffling of <i>Star Wars</i> canon following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm,Â Boba Fett, the stoic bounty hunter who fell in battle in the first act of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, returned to the grave after several decades-worth of novels, comics and video games had depicted him as having survived the Sarlacc pit.</p>
      <p>Fans have since searched for any indication at the current canon might bring him back once again. Some believe that Disney+'s <a href="http://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian">The Mandalorian</a> will do just that. Director Dave Filoni certainly seems open to the possibility. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he stated, "There's always the possibility. I don't like to limit our storytelling in any way. Who knows? I've been surprised." Filoni then added, "It would be really hypocritical for the guy that helped bring Darth Maul back to life... to say that somebody can't survive a Sarlacc pit, but I don't know."</p>

      <p>Fans will know that -- while Boba Fett possessed similar armor, weaponry and skills -- the bounty hunter is not a true Mandalorian. As the prequel trilogy films established, Boba is a clone of Jango Fett. He was created on Kamino at Jango's request, in exchange for giving the cloners permission to use his genetic material to create a clone army.</p>
      <p>On top of that, the government of Mandalore disassociated themselves with Jango, claiming that the bounty hunter was not Mandalorian at all, and that he had simply stolen their armor. So if Boba does return to the franchise in <i>The Mandalorian</i>, it would certainly be interesting to see how the crumbling warrior society greets him.</p>
      <p>Created by Jon Favreau, <i>The Mandalorian</i> stars Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Emily Swallow, Omid Abtahi, Werner Herzog and Nick Nolte.</p>
