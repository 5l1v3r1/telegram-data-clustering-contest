        <b>Kandara MP Alice Wahome on Friday, November 22, condemned former Gichugu MP Martha Karua for calling out the squabbling between female leaders from both the Inua Mama and Team Embrace factions of Jubilee Party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking during an Inua Mama event in Narok Town, the Kandara lawmaker warned Karua against dressing down other women leaders.</p>
      <p>"You need to understand that the space and the growth of women which you started has now reached another level.</p>
      <p>"When you say that women leaders in [Team] Embrace and Inua Mama are cheerleaders, what do you want to tell Kenyans?" she questioned.</p>

      <p>Wahome took issue with Karua's choice of words in her castigation of the women groups that she termed unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"If she wants to advise us, she is welcome but we refuse and reject the language and the manner in which she delivered her message," she stated.</p>
      <p>On Monday, November 11, while speaking at a conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46255-martha-karua-harshly-criticises-both-inua-mama-and-team-embrace">Karua criticised both factions</a> of Inua Mama (allied to DP Ruto) and Team Embrace (allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga) for the back-and-forth insults.</p>
      <p>"The most unfortunate thing happening in the Kenyan political space right now is the women Parliamentarians agreeing to be the praise choir for male groupings seeking to succeed the current president," the Narc Kenya party leader had stated.</p>
      <p>She further observed that the MPs were agreeing to be 'cheerleaders' for their male counterparts, adding that it was a disservice to fellow women.</p>
      <p>Karua's sentiments came after several months of grueling campaigns and countrywide tours by the two factions as they drummed up support for their preferred candidates.</p>
