      <p>PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Grain trading group COFCO International named Richeng Luan as its new chairman, succeeding Jingtao (Johnny) Chi who stood down to join another Chinese state-controlled grain firm.</p>
      <p>Luan has served as vice-president of COFCO Corporation, the majority owner of COFCO International, since 2016, responsible for the group's grains and oilseeds, sugar and cotton businesses, COFCO International said in a statement.</p>
