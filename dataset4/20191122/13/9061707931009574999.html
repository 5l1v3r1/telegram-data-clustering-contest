      <p>A small number of parents who took their children out of a South Derbyshire school to go on holiday have been criticised by Osted inspectors.</p>
      <p>It comes as staff and pupils at the primary school near Swadlincote had plenty of reason to celebrate after it was declared "good" after an Ofsted inspection.</p>
      <p>Inspectors from education watchdog visited <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/school-children-become-language-experts-2127116">Albert Village Primary School</a> on October 23 and October 24 to carry out the first inspection since the school was converted into an academy in January 2017.</p>
      <p>During the visits, chief inspector Anthony O'Malley, noted that pupils at the primary school seemed to have fun when they were there and worked hard.</p>
      <p>He also praised the school, which has 208 pupils, for the the work carried out by leaders to ensure that the school has continued to improve in recent years.</p>
      <p>However, the report also noted that attendance at the school was below the national average due to a small number of parents taking their children out of lessons for holidays.</p>
      <p>It said: "Attendance is below average. A small minority of parents take their children on holiday during term times. Senior leaders need to work more effectively with these parents to ensure they understand the negative impact of absence on pupils' academic and personal development."</p>
      <p>The head teacher of the school, Sue Savage, said the school is working hard on the issue, but it is partly due to the difference in school holidays across nearby counties, as many children live in Derbyshire, but attend the Leicestershire school, while their siblings may be at schools in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Malley wrote in his report: "Pupils work hard and have fun at school. They enjoy their learning because lessons are interesting. Pupils follow instructions carefully and work hard. They appreciate the help they get if they find something tricky.</p>
      <p>"They have many opportunities to contribute to the life of the school.</p>
      <p>"Leaders have ensured that the school has continued to improve in recent years. They have delivered high-quality training to staff at Albert Village Primary and in other schools. Subject plans identify the knowledge and skills that pupils should learn.</p>
      <p>"Leaders have high ambitions for pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND). Teachers ensure that pupils with SEND work on the same, or very similar, tasks as others. They get all the additional help they need."</p>

      <p>The report also praised the school's use of characters 'Freddy Frog' and 'Max' who come into the school to 'help' the teachers in lessons.</p>
      <p>Head teacher Sue Savage said: "We are proud that Albert Village continues to be a good school and that is down to the hard work and commitment from all staff. We are very proud of our children and the talented, committed, quality staff we have across the board.</p>
      <p>"Our high expectations for every child and innovative and forward thinking work on the curriculum has been praised. Everything we do has the children at heart and our emphasis on both staff and pupil wellbeing was highlighted.</p>
      <p>"Children thrive in our school. The inspection confirms that we are living out our school motto everyday; 'working our way to wisdom; learning our way for life'."</p>
