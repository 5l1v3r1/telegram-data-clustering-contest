      <h1>Most Child Abuse Survivors Do Well as Adults</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Preidt HealthDay Reporter</a></address>
      <p>FRIDAY, Nov. 22, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Two in three survivors of childhood sexual abuse have good <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-making-diagnosis">mental health</a>, but a new study suggests that social isolation, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm">chronic pain</a>, substance abuse and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-basics">depression</a> can hinder recovery.</p>
      <p>Researchers looked at 651 Canadian survivors to identify factors associated with what the researchers call complete <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness">mental health</a>.</p>
      <p>"Remarkably, two-thirds [65%] of the childhood sexual abuse survivors in our sample met the criteria for complete <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/default.htm">mental health</a> -- defined as being happy or satisfied with life most days in the past month, having high levels of social and psychological well-being in the past month, and being free of mental illness, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-recognizing-signs-of-suicide">suicidal thoughts</a> and substance dependence in the past year," said lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson. She is director of the Institute for Life Course and Aging at the University of Toronto.</p>
      <p>"While the prevalence of complete mental health among childhood sexual abuse survivors is higher than we had expected, it is still substantially less than that found in the general population [77%]," Fuller-Thomson said in a university news release.</p>
      <p>Survivors who'd been depressed at any point in their life were significantly less likely to have complete mental health, a finding that highlights the importance of mental health treatment for these patients, according to the authors.</p>
      <p>"Having a confidante was found to be the second-strongest single predictor of complete mental health, increasing the odds of past-year complete mental health nearly sevenfold," said co-author Deborah Goodman, director of the Child Welfare Institute, Children's Aid Society of Toronto.</p>
      <p>"Given the importance of family and social support systems, brief interventions to address trauma post-experience and bolster social and familial support are also called for," Goodman said.</p>
      <p>Also, childhood sexual abuse survivors who had <a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/understanding-pain-management-chronic-pain">chronic pain</a> were half as likely to have complete mental health as those without chronic pain.</p>
      <p>"By expanding our research focus from the devastating consequences of childhood sexual abuse to factors correlated with well-being in adulthood, we may be able to help design more effective interventions for those affected to not only survive, but thrive," Fuller-Thomson said.</p>
      <p>The study was published Nov. 19 online in the journal <i>Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology</i>.</p>
