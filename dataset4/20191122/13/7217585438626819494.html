      <h1>You can now get Google Assistant to buy movie tickets for you</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:58:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Google on Thursday revealed a feature that will allow users to buy movie tickets through Google Assistant if you happen to be in the United States or United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Using the <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/05/25-of-google-duplex-calls-are-made-by-human-beings/">company’s Duplex technology</a>, which allows users to make restaurant reservations, users can now ask the Assistant to show them movie schedules.</p>
      <p>“After selecting a theatre and time that works best for you, you’ll have the option to ‘Buy tickets’ with the Assistant,” Google explained on its <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/save-time-buying-movie-tickets-google-assistant-chrome/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The feature is compatible with over 70 American cinemas, including AMC and Fandango, as well as the UK’s ODEON.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to Duplex on the web technology, the Assistant will be able to navigate the site and input your information,” the company said further.</p>
      <p>According to Google, the Assistant’s next goal is to help users order car rentals.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the company also announced that the Assistant will now be able to <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-assistant-latest-news-united-states/">read the latest news to users</a> as well.</p>
