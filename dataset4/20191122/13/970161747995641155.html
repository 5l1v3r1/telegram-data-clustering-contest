      <p>Fabian Edwards and Mike Shipman had to be separated by security as a heated face-off turned physical on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The middleweights were weighing in for their clash at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bellator/">Bellator</a> London and tempers boiled over.</p>
      <p>Edwards didn’t take his eyes off Shipman when he entered the room to step on the scales and then accused his rival of looking scared.</p>
      <p>‘Why you flinching?’ Edwards said before moving his hand towards the face of Shipman.</p>

      <p>That action prompted a melee, with Shipman lunging at Edwards as security and team members quickly jumped in.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-venom-page/">Michael Venom Page</a>, a gym team-mate of Shipman, rushed in to confront Edwards, but was also wrestled away by security.</p>
