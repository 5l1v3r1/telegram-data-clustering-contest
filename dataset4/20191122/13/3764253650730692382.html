      <p>
        <b>- Rapper Kanye West and legendary producer Dr Dre announced that they are working on a joint album</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The album is to be titled Jesus Is King Part II, paying homage to West's first gospel record Jesus Is King</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kanye West announced a joint project with Dr Dre on his Twitter account late yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>He posted a picture of himself and Dr Dre in the studio. West captioned the picture, "Ye and Dre Jesus is King Part II coming soon."</p>
      <p>This will, surprisingly, be the first time the two stars work together.</p>
      <p>But then again, Dre is quite the recluse these days and hardly releases new music or performs. That's what will make this project extra special for the pair's fans.</p>

      <p>West's fans are super excited to hear what the two talents are going to cook up.</p>

      <p>What's particularly interesting to see are the words of encouragement from the new Christian fan base that West has tapped into.</p>
