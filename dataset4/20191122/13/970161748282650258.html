      <p>A mum-of-six who died while pregnant with her seventh child ‘might have survived’ if she hadn’t taken cocaine in the past, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Lindsey Ann Hughes, 34, became ill in her kitchen on March 14 this year and died in Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital 13 days later.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, which caused her to collapse and led to respiratory failure, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Ms Hughes, from Llangefni, north Wales, was also found to have ‘abnormally high’ levels of the cocaine in her system when she died, and was eight times over drugs limit for driving.</p>
      <p>North West Wales coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones stated that the drugs were likely to have ‘contributed’ to her death.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘If she had not taken cocaine in the past the probability is that she would have survived the bronchopneumonia, but we cannot be sure.</p>

      <p>‘Because of the bronchopneumonia she died of natural causes, this is not a drug death, the cocaine contributed but did not ultimately cause her death.’</p>

      <p>Ms Hughes, who was 15 weeks pregnant with a son when she died, was found to have damage to her heart known as cardiac fibrosis, which can be caused by chronic cocaine use.</p>
      <p>However, the inquest heard she had been carrying a ‘perfectly healthy male fetus’.</p>
      <p>Mr Pritchard Jones issued a warning to the public that cocaine can and does cause long-term issues.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I am seeing far too many cocaine deaths as the use of cocaine in this part of the world is very common.</p>
      <p>‘Cocaine damages the heart by killing off patches of heart tissue and causes a tightening of the vessels.</p>
      <p>‘Even low levels of cocaine can cause catastrophic results and repeat use causes more and more damage. The public think cocaine doesn’t do any long-term harm but it does.</p>
      <p>‘Cocaine use can and does cause long term issues.’</p>
      <p>It was also noted that Ms Hughes’ immune system would have been suppressed due to the fact she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>A friend of Ms Hughes, Helen Evans, told the inquest she had been ‘full of life’ and was a ‘brilliant mother’.</p>
      <p>Ms Evans continued: ‘She was a devoted mother and partner, caring daughter and joyful sister – her death has left a massive hole in so many people’s lives.’</p>

      <p>Ms Hughes’ parents will now care for her six children, Carly, 16, Lennox, 15, Holly, 11, Poppy, six, Jaxton, two, and one year old Xavi.</p>
