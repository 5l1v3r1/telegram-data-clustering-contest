      <p><b>New Delhi</b><b>: </b>Country’s largest power producer NTPC may make an aggressive bid of about Rs 10,000 crore to buy out the Centre’s stake in two hydro power-producing companies – NEEPCO and THDC, two persons having knowledge of the development said.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday cleared strategic disinvestment in the two hydroelectric power generating PSUs in favor of NTPC that is looking to expand its operations and boost the renewable portfolio.</p>
      <p>One of the persons quoted above said that the thermal power generator may offer close to Rs 10,000 crore through the transaction advisor will come to valuations about the entities later. The portfolio of projects with the NEEPCO and THDC make it a fit case to command good value.</p>
      <p>The Centre holds an entire 100 percent stake in NEEPCO that operates close to 1,500 MW of power plants in the northeastern region and has 75 percent holding in THDC. The Uttar Pradesh government holds a 25 percent stake in THDC India. (IANS)</p>
