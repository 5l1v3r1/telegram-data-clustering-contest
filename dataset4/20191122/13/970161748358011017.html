      <p>Thousands of people’s homes are at risk of being swallowed up by the sea.</p>
      <p>That’s the warning from a leading insurance company which fears that the ‘idyllic coastline’ of Britain is doomed to ‘fade away’</p>
      <p>The website Confused.com has released research which indicates the grim effects coastal erosion could have on seaside towns over in the next century.</p>
      <p>It wrote: ‘The Environmental Agency calculated that 7,000 homes, worth more than £1 bilion, will fall into the sea within this century.</p>
      <p>‘The report also states that 520,000 properties are in areas with coastal flooding risk, and without further action this figure could treble to 1.5m by the 2080s.</p>
      <p>‘Recently, Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey stated that “one in six people in England are already living in properties at risk of flooding”.</p>

      <p>‘A combination of coastal erosion, rising sea levels and climate change all contribute to this nationwide issue.’</p>

      <p>It has produced an interactive map to illustrate the problem and has also drawn up graphics to show what could happen over the next 20, 50 and 100 years.</p>
      <p>Here are the towns it thinks are most at risk.</p>
      <h3>1) Happisburgh, Norfolk</h3>
      <p>This is a town just under 20 miles away from Norwich which is one of the highest risk coastal erosion areas in the UK with 318 feet of land predicted to be lost over the next 20 years. This is the equivalent to the length of two football pitches</p>
      <p>More than 30 homes have been lost to land erosion in this area already.</p>
      <h3>2) Kessingland, Suffolk</h3>
      <p>This town is around 30 miles from Norwich.</p>
      <p>It’s feared that by 2039, 230 feet of land will have been eroded and within 50 years it the sea will have swallowed a total of 574 feet.</p>
      <p>Many places near the shore are farmers’ fields, although there are some holiday parks and houses.</p>
      <p>‘As the coastline moves inward, more houses and caravans could be washed away,’ Confused.com warned.</p>

      <h3>3) Hornsea, East Riding of Yorkshire</h3>
      <p>The East Yorkshire town of Hornsea sits by the sea about 16 miles from the city of Hull.</p>
      <p>With coastal erosion in this area already swallowing up around 13ft of land per year on unprotected parts, it’s feared that approximately 237 homes are likely to be lost on East Yorkshire’s coastline in the next nine decades.</p>
