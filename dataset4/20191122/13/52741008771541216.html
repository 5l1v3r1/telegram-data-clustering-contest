      <p>WASHINGTON — A former FBI lawyer is being investigated for allegedly altering a document related to surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser in 2016, according to a person familiar with the case and published news reports.</p>
      <p>The Associated Press confirmed reports by CNN and The Washington Post that the finding will be in a report Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz releases Dec. 9 on early stages of the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s election meddling. The news reports cited unidentified individuals.</p>
      <p>The conduct of the FBI employee, who was forced out, didn’t alter Horowitz’s finding that the surveillance application of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page had a proper legal and factual basis, an official told the Post.</p>
      <p>An FBI spokesman declined comment Friday. An inspector general spokesman didn’t return a message seeking comment</p>
