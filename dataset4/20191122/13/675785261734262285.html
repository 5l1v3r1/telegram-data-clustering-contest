      <p>Let us talk about a political party so economically illiterate that it has promised to spend more while taxing less.</p>
      <p>It is refusing to show you the map of where the magic money forest is or tell you by what means they will harvest these fantabulous financial fruits.</p>
      <p>This party has presided over a national debt that spiralled to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicspending/bulletins/ukgovernmentdebtanddeficitforeurostatmaast/june2019">84% of GDP.</a> The interest payments alone have cost us more than EU membership, yet this party also promises us new roads, hospitals, police officers, healthcare and more benefits for 10m Universal Credit claimants.</p>
      <p>You might expect such a party to be condemned by the Tories for its appalling, secretive, imaginary maths. You may think that, if a single political party's crackpot ideology has cost us so much more than the EU, the Tories would suggest every voter of sense abandon that party in the national interest.</p>
      <p>But you will have to wait a long time for it, because it's the Tories that have done all these fiscally-barking, politically-deadly, and utterly bats*** things.</p>
      <p>But hey, look at the Labour Party manifesto everyone! It's completely mental!</p>

      <p>It's got all this crazy spending, and all these numbers that when you put them together add up to bigger numbers, and they're going to spend it on bus drivers and veterans and care workers. Why, Britain would go down the tubes within a week! We'd be eating our first-born and living in caves by Christmas.</p>
      <p>Bus drivers and veterans and care workers don't matter. Not as much as second-home owners, and parents who send their children to public school, and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnsons-tories-handed-1million-20932980">Bahamas-based billionaire who pays his taxes in the US.</a></p>
      <p>The Tory fake news machine - with fake fact-checkers, restricted press scrutiny and fake websites that scrape your internet data - has done a grand job of making sure everyone thinks Labour's promises are stark, staring mad.</p>
      <p>So let's look at some of them, and judge for ourselves.</p>
      <p>A random glance throws up:</p>
      <h3>* Hundreds of billions of pounds of borrowing to invest in green energy and regional infrastructure</h3>
      <p>Yep, that borrowing word. But nations are not credit cards, and when you invest there is always a return. Green energy businesses that are seeded here will be able to lead the world. Regional projects attract private businesses, create jobs, and improve communities. Bby comparison, Boris Johnson has promised a meagre Â£1bn for electric car companies. Whoop-de-doo.</p>
      <h3>* 5% pay rise for all public sector workers</h3>
      <p>Under austerity, the 5.3m public servants who keep this country ticking had 3 years of pay freezes and then 1% annual caps that were effectively a pay cut. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-pledges-5-public-sector-20929532">The 5% promised by Labour makes their pay what it should have been,</a> and remember - those 5m will all be paying more tax, and spending more, too.</p>
      <p>Imagine working for an organisation that had cut your pay for 9 years in a row! We're lucky any of them still turn up.</p>
      <h3>* Spending 3% of GDP on research and development to provide a long-term future for the steel industry</h3>
      <p>An important one, this - steel is made by burning coal, yet we need it to build almost everything from wind turbines to solar panels and car parts. Labour promises to back British steel with government contracts, which removes the national security risks of buying in low-quality components from other countries. They promise steel recycling plants, a business rate cut for new investors, and research into carbon capture.</p>
      <p>You may want to argue whether a nation has to speculate to accumulate, but there is not a single billionaire who would agree you can make more money by sitting on it.</p>

      <p>Another casual glance throws up a 3% stamp duty increase for foreign property buyers - all those oligarchs who launder cash through UK accounts, all the investors who snap up London riverside properties and never live in them, all those absentee landlords. What a good idea.</p>
      <p>Labour wants to reinstate the 3,000 local bus routes cut in the past decade, and free bus passes for the under-25s. In many places, parents will be able to stop doing the school run, cutting pollution and increasing time at work. Buses carry 3m passengers a year, mainly poorer and lower-paid people, and an improved service gets them to work, school and hospital. Ring your mum, and ask her if that's wrong.</p>
      <p><a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/">Another scroll brings up better funding for community and social care,</a> mental health services for the 3 in 4 children who can't get the help they need, childcare for two-year-olds so parents can get back to work, and paying tax, a bit sooner, an inquiry into fake news, letting football fans have a say in running their clubs. Grab a colleague, and ask them if they'd like that.</p>
      <p>The problem with the Labour manifesto is not with its promises, or its sums.</p>

      <p>Tell your mum, or colleague, that the <i>Tories</i> will bring back neighbourhood policing. That <i>Boris Johnson</i> will let the 4.5m self-employed have free broadband and low-cost business loans. Say the party has promised to continue Theresa May's important work on domestic abuse by properly funding women's refuges. Tell them there's a politician who thinks, when refugees come to this country, they should be get a job, pay taxes, and assimilate.</p>
      <p>They'll probably listen to those ideas. They'll decide if borrowing to achieve some or all of these things is worth it, and will pay dividends in the long term. And if you ask, they'll tell you they'd vote for the party that offers these things.</p>
      <p>Then tell them these are Jeremy Corbyn's ideas, and see what they do.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>It's the Tories who won't show you their sums, and show no sign of doing so while attention is focused on Labour's homework. It's the Tories who racked up the debt. It's the Tories who said not investing in the country would bring its own rewards, which turned out to be knife crime, a social care crisis and jobs bleeding out. It was Johnson who said "f*** business".</p>
      <p>I am no flag-waver for Corbyn. I think his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/justice-nuclear-test-veterans-labour-20147174">offer to recognise nuclear test veterans is decent and sane,</a> and his attitude to anti-Semitism is damaging and mad. But it is possible to look at his manifesto and see the promises of many people, not just the ideas of a few billionaires who came over to dinner. There are policies you can argue with, because he has shown you his sums.</p>
      <p>Johnson's attitude to veterans is that they should not be tried for murder, even if there is evidence they committed one. His offer to Islamophobes is to water down the internal inquiry into them that he promised when he ran for leader. He says there is a magic money forest, just over the hill, and to trust him. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe">Again.</a></p>
      <p>There is one thing Johnson and Corbyn have in common, which is that they are both yet to achieve a single worthwhile thing. Corbyn does, pretty much, what it says on the side of his tin - his manifesto really is a "real change". Johnson is a fairground entertainer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-warn-shoppers-not-fall-11214649">with a three-cup trick, and no way the customer can win.</a></p>
      <p>But this general election is not about choosing which of them you want to run the country. The Labour manifesto has slim chance of ever being enacted. This vote is about whether Boris Johnson gets a majority with which to run riot, or a parliament so hung that it will draw and quarter his political corpse.</p>
      <p>There is only one way to vote, and it is for anyone but this liar, this charlatan, this cruel and unusual fool. Anyone but Boris.</p>
