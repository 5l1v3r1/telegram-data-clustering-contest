      <h1>State ministers to discuss on solid waste management</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:16:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The government will convene a meeting of environment ministers of all states to discuss the problem of single-use plastic and solid waste management and measures to solve it, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in Lok Sabha on Friday.</p>
      <p>Javadekar said collection of thin plastic waste and small pouches of plastic is an issue.</p>
      <p>"We are convening a meeting of environment ministers of all states next month where issues related to single-use plastic and solid waste management will be discussed," he said during Question Hour.</p>
      <p>The minister said 25-30 tons of plastic waste is generated every day in the country and just two thirds of it is collected.</p>
      <p>The rest of the plastic continues to be in the environment as garbage in drains, beaches, roads and other places, he said.</p>
      <p>Javadekar said around 30 crore mobile phones become redundant every year and recycling them is also an issue.</p>
      <p>The minister as well as several MPs suggested that people should give up the use of plastic bags and instead use cloth or jute bags for day-to-day use like shopping.</p>
      <p>The government is also looking into the option of bio-degradable plastic, Javadekar said.</p>
      <p>As there were many questions related to plastic waste, Speaker Om Birla said separate time could be earmarked for a detailed discussions on the issue.</p>
      <p>"This House is the representative body of the country's 130 crore population. There should be a discussion on this important issue. We should take a pledge in this House against plastic waste. I am sure the entire House stands united on this," he said.Â </p>
