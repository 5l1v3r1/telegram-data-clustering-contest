        <b>The management of Ambrose Alli University (AAU) in Edo says it will need about N500 million to construct a befitting mini stadium in the school environment in honour of the country’s sports men and women who graduated from the institution.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ignatius Onimawo, the vice-chancellor of the state-owned university, disclosed this while speaking on the preparations for the institution’s maiden ‘Pillar of Sports Award/Endowment Fund’ billed to hold on November 28.</p>
      <p>Onimawo, who was represented by Aigbokhavbolo Oziegbe, the deputy vice-chancellor (DVC academic), said the aim of constructing the mini-stadium is to ensure steady development of sports in the area and the country in general.</p>
      <p>The vice-chancellor also noted that prominent Edo indigenes, including Odion Ighalo, Super Eagles striker, and Bash Ali, a renowned boxer, would be honoured for their contributions to sports development in the state and in the country.</p>
      <p>He further said Aisha Buhari, wife of the president; Festus Keyamo, minister of state for labour and employment; and Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River, who are graduates of the university, would also be honoured.</p>
      <p>“We want to begin to reward excellence in sports every year and for this to happen we need infrastructure where people can display their talents; this is why we need a mini stadium and we need N500 million for it to be achieved,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>“AAU has come of age. It came into existence in 1981 and, since then, has produced great people for this country, including the First Lady, Mrs Aisha Buhari. The institution has also produced men of God among whom is Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. We have many of them all over the world.</p>
      <p>“When we came on board, the VC had the vision to transform the AAU in all aspect. His target was to make the institution the best state university and also to be among the top 10 in the country. That, we have achieved in terms of ICT, welfare, academic and sports.”</p>
