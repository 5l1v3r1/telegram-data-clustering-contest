      <p>First up, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZeHmnpnlhY&amp;feature=emb_title"><i>The Late Late Show</i></a> with James Corden, the cast of <i>Frozen 2</i> went to the intersection of Beverly Blvd. and Genesee Ave in Los Angeles to deliver and intermittent live performance of musical sequences<i> Frozen Crosswalk: The Musical</i>.

      <p>Next up, since were coming up on Thanksgiving, you’ll be seeing <i>It’s A Wonderful Life</i> airing all over the place. So maybe you’d like to know about the difference between the film and <i>The Greatest Gift</i>, the 40-page short story that inspired it. How do you turn that short of a story into a 130-minute movie? Well, it might help to know that the entire short story serves as only the last third of the movie, so a lot was added to beef this one up.</p>
