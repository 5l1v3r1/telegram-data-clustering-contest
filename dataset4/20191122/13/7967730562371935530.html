      <p>A $6 million plan hatched by Archibald winner <b>Ben Quilty</b> to convert a former dairy into an art gallery at Retford Park, the former home of art-lover <b>James Fairfax</b>, is raising eyebrows in the Southern Highlands art set.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old artist-du-jour has been busy this month opening <i>Quilty</i>, a retrospective of his work at the Art Gallery of NSW, and on Tuesday <i><a href="https://iview.abc.net.au/show/quilty-painting-the-shadows">Quilty: Painting the Shadows</a></i> aired on ABC TV.</p>

      <p>Last Sunday, he spoke at a fundraiser at the stunning property that Fairfax, the former chairman of publisher John Fairfax Ltd, bought from the Hordern family in 1964. Fairfax gifted the grand <i>Italianate</i> style residence to the National Trust in 2016, before he died at the “Gentleman’s Estate” in 2017.</p>
      <p>Quilty has been working solidly for the past 18 months to get permission and financial support for the gallery, which he feels is a perfect fit for the property where Fairfax, an avid art collector, was famous for hosting some of the nation’s best artists, including <b>Sidney Nolan</b>, <b>Margaret Olley, </b><b>Colin Lanceley</b> and <b>Donald Friend</b>.</p>

      <p>In December last year, Minister for the Arts <b>Don Harwin</b> announced the NSW government would tip in $2.49 million through its Regional Cultural Fund. Before that decision, in 2017, Quilty – also a Trustee at the Art Gallery of NSW – gave Mr Harwin one of his works, valued at $4000, which the minister later declared according to the ministerial code of conduct.</p>

      <p>The local Wingecarribee Shire Council has promised $2.5 million in operating costs over five years; former BT Australia banker and art collector <b>Rob Ferguson, </b>who chairs the working committee is believed to have pledged $2 million; and a recent dinner co-hosted by local <b>Skye Leckie</b> and art adviser <b>Justin Miller </b>has ensured the project has the cash to go ahead.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday more than 600 locals gathered to celebrate, dining on local produce and sipping Southern Highlands wines and beers, while resident rocker<b> Jimmy Barnes</b> and his daughter <b>Mahalia</b> belted out tunes. But throughout the genteel, well-heeled district, not everyone raised their glasses in a toast.</p>
      <p>Archibald winner <b>Tim Storrier</b> is said to be nonplussed. "I think it is a good idea, but the key for a regional gallery is to have it somewhere central, the success of a local gallery is all about location, location, location," said <b>Janet Storrier</b>, wife of Tim, who is also the 2017 Moran Portrait winner. Even art doyen and fellow Archibald winner <b>John Olsen</b> has reservations too.</p>
      <p>"John Olsen was sceptical until he saw the place but now he will donate a painting," Quilty told PS. "It's a very ambitious project and we need a place big enough to host the Archibalds and other travelling exhibitions ... I got this up, I did it myself, I have funded staff, paid for a feasibility study and I am an artist. My wife has asked me why do I bother but I believe in this project."</p>

      <p>The Southern Highlands is home to perhaps more Archibald-prize-winning artists and finalists per capita than any other part of regional Australia. But PS understands the gallery location, a few kilometres from public transport and downtown Bowral, has upset some small business owners. "You have to drive through a housing estate to get to it, which looks like Campbelltown," said one, who wished to remain nameless. "If Quilty helps the town by putting the gallery downtown, the town will help Quilty," said another. Many Bowral business owners were reluctant to speak to PS because this is the popular Quilty's passion project.</p>
      <p>Others are unhappy about the way the project has been managed. They claim a lack of transparency from the local Wingecarribee Shire Council, which held an extraordinary general meeting, which was closed to the public, last year to discuss the funding. A lack of a promised business plan was also sited as an issue. A cloud also hangs over the relationship with the National Trust after the resignation of Retford Park manager <b>Scott Pollock</b>.</p>
      <p>"At least eight sites were looked at in the region," says former Goulburn Regional Art Gallery director <b>Jane Cush</b>. "Retford Park as a gallery site has been an entirely Ben Quilty driven venue, which might explain why there is some friction in the community, they haven't had a say."</p>
      <blockquote>If Quilty helps the town by putting the gallery downtown, the town will help Quilty.<cite>An anonymous local</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Blue Mountains artist <b>Ian Milliss</b>, who worked on the establishment of a regional art gallery in Katoomba said: "You want an art gallery in the middle of the local shopping centre so it is accessible to everyone and so the local businesses benefit."</p>
      <p>Others – such as former actresses and now Southern Highlands residents <b>Noelene Brown</b> and <b>Geraldine Turner</b>, who ran unsuccessfully for local council – would have liked an arts centre that incorporated theatre facilities, they told PS. But after a 30-year battle and the local theatre recently closing because of structural problems, they are glad to have at least something for regional arts. Some suggest the former Victorian Bowral courthouse and police station would be a better site. It is across the road from Corbett Park, which hosts the annual tulip festival and draws crowds of around 60,000. The Berrima Jail, which will become available next year, is being canvassed too. This may be an appropriate arts precinct as it is is the site where art was once produced in the form of wooden cuckoo clocks by former inmate and disgraced Corrective Services minister <b>Rex Jackson</b>.</p>
      <p>Quilty, who fought to keep the National Arts School in the old Darlinghurst Jail, believes old Heritage-listed jails are not a great canvas to display artwork. He remains adamant the old dairy is a perfect site, and challenges his critics to see the location.</p>
      <h3>Hutchence remembered 22 years on</h3>
      <p>November 22 marked the 22nd anniversary since INXS frontman <b>Michael Hutchence</b>’s body was found in the old Ritz Carlton Hotel in Double Bay. Two retellings of the Hutchence story by two friends will commemorate it. One – an exhibition by Los Angeles-based rock photographer <b>Chris Cuffaro</b> – opened Thursday night, and the other – the documentary <i>Mystify</i> by <b>Richard Lowenstein</b> – will air on ABC TV on Sunday night.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.517%2C$multiply_1.5109%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_62%2Cf_auto/187b0e43b2be736131a46142570abf5e40314153"/>

      <p>Cuffaro first met Hutchence in 1988 but struck up a friendship with him in LA on October 1, 1993, when he spent the day photographing him for a shoot commissioned for US-based <i>Detour</i> magazine.</p>
      <p>Cuffaro – who has shot photos of everyone in Hollywood, including the wedding of <b>Tom Hanks </b>and <b>Rita Wilson – </b>said he trawled through over 500 images to whittle it down to 40 frames of the larger than life rocker, who would have been 60 next January.</p>
      <p>The exhibition (on until January 10 at Paddington’s Blender Gallery) is just a few hundred metres from the home Hutchence purchased in Wentworth Street Paddington in 1985, with his first love <b>Michelle Bennett</b>. Lownstein’s documentary reveals she was the last person Hutchence called for help before he hung himself. A coroner ruled the 37-year-old had committed suicide by hanging himself while depressed and under the influence of alcohol and drugs.</p>

      <p>In this new work, Lowenstein – who first worked with Hutchence in his 1986 drama <i>Dogs in Space –</i> explores his life with Bennett and includes some frank interviews with <b>Kylie Minogue</b>, who reflects on her romantic years with the Crows Nest-born sex symbol/ singer. It reveals Hutchence’s loss of smell, after sustaining a brain injury in an accident in Copenhagen that ultimately lead to his break-up with Danish model <b>Helena Christensen</b>. It explores the unravelling of his relationship with <b>Paula Yates</b>, and the medications he was on for his brain injury.</p>
      <p>"Michael’s personality changed dramatically," his sister <b>Tina Hutchence</b> said in the film. It's is a must-watch for INXs fans.</p>
      <h3>Elton seeks tennis court</h3>
      <p><b>Elton John</b> will soon arrive in Australia for his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Australian tour, which starts next Saturday in Perth. Although his first Sydney concert isn't scheduled until December 21, his minders are already in town scoping out potential digs for Team Elton. The local leg of his three-year long final world tour, a feat only <b>John Farnham</b> would envy, ends in Parramatta on March 7. The 72-year-old singer is bringing his husband David Furnish and two sons for the nearly four-month stint, so a family-friendly residence is crucial.</p>

      <p>PS has heard the Woollahra colonial mansion Woodlands, owned by former Crown casino boss <b>Rob Rankin</b>, is the most likely contender. The house, which was bought from adman <b>John Singleton</b> for $6,825,000 in 2003, was a temporary home for <b>Hugh Jackman</b> and <b>Deborah Furness</b> on one of their short-term Sydney stays. The only problem with the 1884-built mansion at 85 Wallaroy Road is that it has no tennis court. John, who will employ the same personal trainer he had on his last Sydney stay, is now a keen tennis player. Lucky, then, that his stay coincides with the Australian Open and the Sydney International. His entourage is desperately seeking a generous tennis court owner so John can keep up his training. If not, nearby White City will have to do.</p>
      <h3>Choir still calls Australia home</h3>
      <p>They’ve sung for three Popes, many presidents (<b>Barack Obama</b> and <b>Nelson Mandela</b>), <b>Queen Elizabeth II</b>, <b>Oprah Winfrey</b>, the <b>Dalai Lama</b> and countless dignitaries.</p>
      <p>The Australian Girls Choir, and its Indigenous offshoot The Girls from Oz, have even sung as a surprise for <i>The Boy from Oz</i> star <b>Hugh Jackman </b>at his 40th birthday<b>.</b></p>
      <figure>

      <p>On Sunday, the group will celebrate its 35th birthday and the 90th birthday of choir founder <b>Judith Curphey</b>. Curphey began the choir as a retirement project at the age of 55, wanting to challenge the accepted conventions in 1984 that "boys sang better than girls and that choirs belonged in English Cathedrals". The girls choir is now known affectionately as The Qantas Choir, for the part they played in one of the best known and longest-running (21 years) TV ads of all time. In 1988, then-Qantas CEO <b>Geoff Dixon</b> saw the group perform with The National Boys Choir at Carols by Candlelight at the Myer Music Bowl. He called <b>John Singleton</b>. "I want that choir. I want them on Ayer's Rock, The Brooklyn Bridge and the Great Wall of China," recalls Ms Curphey.</p>
      <p>The filming of four <i>I still call Australian home</i> advertising campaigns took place between 1988 and 2009. The five months of filming for the first took place on a glacier in Argentina, a Massai village in Africa, and amongst the Terracotta Warriors in China. The final shot of the first campaign involved 220 young choristers transported in and out of the King's Canyon Northern Territory by helicopter. They were also hooked to safety lines to climb the Mexican Pyramids and the Sydney Opera House, where on Sunday they will perform a concert to celebrate their success. No harnesses will be required, however, other than to keep the audience in their seats.</p>
