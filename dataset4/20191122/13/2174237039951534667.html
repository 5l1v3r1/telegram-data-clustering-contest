      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-who-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">The Who</a> have released their new single titled <i>I Don’t Wanna Get Wise</i>.</p>
      <p>It follows <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/the-who-launch-furious-new-single-all-this-music-must-fade"><i>All This Music Must Fade</i></a>, with both tracks included on the band’s upcoming studio album <i>Who</i>, which will launch on December 6 through Polydor Records.</p>
      <p>The single comes just days after fans visiting London’s new <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/the-who-become-the-first-artist-to-be-honoured-on-londons-music-walk-of-fame">Music Walk Of Fame</a> were given access to a preview of the track.</p>
      <p>It’s also been revealed that the deluxe edition on the new record will include two ‘lost tracks’ from the 60s: <i>Got Nothing To Prove</i> and <i>Sand</i>.</p>
      <p>Guitarist Pete Townshend says: “Both these songs are from the summer of 1966. They would not have been rejected by the band members but rather by my then creative mentor, Who manager Kit Lambert. </p>
      <p>“In 1967, when the song seemed destined for the bottom drawer, I did offer <i>Got Nothing To Prove</i> to Jimmy James and the Vagabonds who used to support us at The Marquee in 1965. I remember playing him the demo at my house in Twickenham.</p>
      <p>“They were still managed by Peter Meaden who had been so influential on me in particular in the short period he was our PR man in late 1964. </p>
      <p>“Jimmy liked the song, and suggested making it more R&amp;B, in a slower tempo, but nothing happened. I have a feeling Kit may have felt the song sounded as though it was sung by an older and more self-satisfied man than I was in real life. That would have applied to Roger too I suppose.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “Now, it works. Back then, perhaps it didn’t. Dave Sardy and I decided to ask George Fenton to do a Swinging Sixties band arrangement to make the song more interesting, but also to place it firmly in an <i>Austin Powers</i> fantasy. I love it.”</p>
      <p>As for <i>Sand</i>, Townshend says it came from the same period, and adds: “This is a simple idea, about a sunny beach vacation romance that doesn’t last once the lovers get back home to the rain. </p>
      <p>"Again, Kit passed on this, even as an album track, and it simply got filed away. I have always loved it, but have been waiting for computers to get smart enough to fix some of the tape stretch problems that had affected the demo.”</p>
      <p>Townsend reports that some backing vocals and guitar work have been added, along with “a feedback section to properly evoke the era.”</p>
      <p>The deluxe edition will also include the tracks <i>This Gun Will Misfire</i> and <i>Danny &amp; His Ponies</i> – both were recorded and sung by Townshend during the new album sessions.</p>
