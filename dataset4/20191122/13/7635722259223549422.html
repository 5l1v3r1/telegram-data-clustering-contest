      <p>Last week’s Man of the Match Jeremy Loughman, Niall Scannell and John Ryan comprise the front row.</p>
      <p>Beirne partners Jean Kleyn in the second row, with O’Donoghue named in a back row that also includes skipper Peter O’Mahony and CJ Stander.</p>
      <p>Alby Mathewson is among the replacements and is set to play his final game for the province.</p>
      <p>Tyler Bleyendaal is injured and wasn't considered.</p>
