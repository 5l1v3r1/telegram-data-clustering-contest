      <p>The Pinnacles at Silver Star Mountain Resort are at the 'Peak' of construction.</p>
      <p>In response to increasing demand for accommodations at the world-renowned North Okanagan ski hill, The Pinnacles Suites is constructing six, three-storey townhomes, called The Peaks.  </p>
      <p>Opening in January 2020, the new 2000-plus-square-foot townhomes sleep up to 10 people and offer prime ski-in, ski-out access to the slopes and breathtaking views over the village to the Monashee Mountains. </p>
      <p>“As rental accommodations become harder to find on the mountain, people are very excited about these new townhomes and already inquiring about reservations for January,” said Destanne Norris, Pinnacles Suites general manager. “In addition, many families and groups prefer our larger suites where they can all stay together, and even bring their dog.”</p>
      <p>Constructed by Pasechnik Construction of Vernon and Maddocks Construction of Armstrong, the townhomes have tandem garages and are adjacent to the existing Pinnacles Suites. The townhomes are fully furnished with deluxe amenities including high ceilings, full kitchen and dining area with covered deck, slate fireplace, three bedrooms, 2.5 baths including full ensuite in the master, flat screen TVs, washer/dryer, and private, heated patio with a six-person hot tub.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the Pinnacles Suites strata complex, the townhomes are privately owned. </p>
      <p>Only two units are remaining and owners can choose to live in their suites full time, lock and leave, or put them into the rental management pool for periods when they are unoccupied</p>
      <p>There is no speculation tax in the North Okanagan and all come with a 10 year warranty.</p>
      <p>The Peaks is the last and final phase of development at the Pinnacles which was started when a group of ski patrollers bought the day lodge from the resort in the mid-1980s. </p>
      <p>They converted it into suites. In 1991, they added on to the central lodge by building three-story suites on the west wing, and then in 2001, the Pinnacles Slopeside townhomes on the east were constructed. Pinnacles Suites manages the rentals and has in-house housekeeping and front-desk staff.</p>
