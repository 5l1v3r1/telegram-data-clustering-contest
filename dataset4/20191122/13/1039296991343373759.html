      <p>New CFMoto showroom located in Thane, set up as brand's Mumbai-Thane facility; the Chinese manufacturer has received over 700 bookings since its launch in July, 2019.</p>
      <p>CFMoto India has inaugurated its first showroom in India, located in Thane-Mumbai megalopolis. The new showroom is a 3S (sales, service, spares) setup and there are plans to open similar outlets in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati. The company says that these seven dealerships are designed to offer a one-stop solution for its customers.</p>
      <p>The company claims that it has received over 700 bookings since it entered the Indian market in July, 2019. Presently, CFMoto has introduced four motorcycles in India – 300NK, 650NK, 650MT and 650GT. Prices begin from Rs 2.29 lakh for the 300NK and go up to Rs 5.49 lakh for the 650GT. We were among the first to ride the MT and GT in India.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the opening ceremony of the premiere Indian CFMoto facility, Kenneth Chen, Assistant General Manager – Global Sales CFMoto, said, “We are happy to unveil our first individual outlet in Mumbai. The company has seen a tremendous acceptance for our launched models and we look forward to exceeding our customer’s expectations by providing them the best value with our product range. The confidence placed by CFMoto’s aficionados and our dealer partners are truly helping us in building the brand’s confidence which will help us offering an unparalleled customer experience with best-in-class sales and service.”</p>
      <p>The opening of the new dealership marks a crucial step in expanding CFMoto’s presence in India, especially considering that the Chinese manufacturer it is a largely unknown brand in the country, while its motorcycles will go up against established competition. That said, it has a fairly large presence in global markets.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1989, CFMoto is based out of Zhejiang Province in China. Currently, the bike maker has a presence in markets such as Australia, Asia and North America. The company formed a tie-up with Austrian motorcycle manufacturer KTM in October 2017 to build and sell the KTM Duke range of motorcycles in China.</p>
