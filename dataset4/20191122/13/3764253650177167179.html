      <p>These days, many promising graduates work as taxi drivers pending the time they get another job or they just sustain it and hope for the best. Well, a young Nigerian man identified as Ehi Onyibe on Twitter has taken to the site to share his experience with a former university mate turned cab driver who ran away after spotting him.</p>

      <p>Ehi who was with his family eventually had to order a cab home and was told his ride will arrive in a minute.</p>

      <p>The driver eventually arrived in a red car but the driver happened to be his set mate from his university he had bumped into earlier. Rather than wait to pick the passengers, the driver zoomed off and did not respond to further calls from Ehi or his sister-in-law.</p>

      <p>Tweeting further, Ehi explained that he has no idea why the guy zoomed off but if it is because of shame, then he his ashamed of him. After all, he wasnâ€™t seen begging or stealing.</p>
