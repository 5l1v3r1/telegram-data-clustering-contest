      <h2>Commission president ‘has returned home from hospital’ after surgery.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:04:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Jacopo Barigazzi</a></address>
      <p>Jean-Claude Juncker is expected back in his office next week after undergoing surgery, a European Commission spokeswoman said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The president of the Commission “has returned home from the hospital,” spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-180411">said</a> during the Commission's daily press briefing. He “is at home, is recovering well and we expect him back in the office next week,” she added.</p>
      <p>Juncker, 64, had surgery on November 11 “to treat an aneurysm," Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/jean-claude-juncker-to-undergo-surgery-on-november-11/">told</a> POLITICO at the end of October, adding that the president was fine but the surgery needed "to be done."</p>
      <p>Juncker's time in office is coming to an end as on Friday afternoon EU ambassadors are expected to approve a Council document that will trigger the ratification process for the new Commission led by Germany's Ursula von der Leyen, even though the U.K has not put forward a commissioner. The European Parliament is then expected to vote on the new Commission next Wednesday.</p>
