      <h1>Plans for new dog day care, training, and boarding centre revealed</h1>
      <h2>It would the fifth branch under the Action Petz brand</h2>

      <p>Plans for a dog day care, training, café and boarding centre in Somercotes have been submitted.</p>
      <p>The application, put in by Skyhardt Limited, would see the business move into a unit on Birchwood Way in Somercotes.</p>
      <p>It would sit near to Griffiths Foods, Gowercroft Joinery and Precast Construction Technology.</p>
      <p>If approved, by <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/amber-valley-borough-council">Amber Valley Borough Council</a>, the business would trade as Action Petz.</p>
      <p>It would offer a dog day care, dog boarding, dog handler education activities, dog agility training, a dog-friendly café and a dog-friendly co-working space.</p>
      <p>The borough council will decide on the plans in the next few months.</p>
      <p>A report filed with the application says that there would be an average of 20 dogs on the site at any one time – which would have indoor and outdoor park areas.</p>
      <p>It reiterates that overnight dog boarding would only be available to six pets per night, meanwhile there would four-to-six at most training classes, up to a maximum of eight.</p>
      <p>It says dogs are not left in kennels inside or outside to bark at any time.</p>
      <p>It says: “The Action Petz boarding is very exclusive and would only be available to an absolute maximum of six dogs per night, as we will be building six kennels in the daycare area of the warehouse.</p>
      <p>“The dogs would be accompanied by at least one staff member at all times, and never left to bark in kennels or anywhere on site.”</p>
      <p>At peak, it says there would be 15 visitors to the site at any one time.</p>
      <p>All dogs would be supervised around the clock by a qualified “force-free” dog trainer.</p>
      <p>Force-free training is teaching an animal without pain, intimidation, threats or coercion.</p>
      <p>The business would create <a href="https://www.fish4.co.uk/jobs/derby/">11 jobs</a>, five full-time and six part-time, but it anticipates increasing this as the firm grows.</p>
      <p>Action Petz currently has four other locations in Cardiff, Cornwall, Newport and Swansea.</p>
      <p>A statement on its website says: “At Action Petz we are passionate about supporting the fantastic work of animal rescue charities and there will always be a focus on rehabilitating and helping dogs without permanent homes, therefore our centres are completely free for dogs living in rescue centres or foster placements.</p>
      <p>“Our Doggy Day Care is a fun and stimulating service that your dog will absolutely love!</p>
      <p>“During his/her time with us your pooch will be able to socialise, play and interact with all kinds of dogs (puppies, seniors; tiny ones, big ones) in a supervised, caring and structured environment.</p>
      <p>“At Action Petz we do our very best to welcome everyone. During your first visit we will get to know your dog and ask you to complete a temperament questionnaire about your dog.</p>
      <p>“If your dog has any behaviours that are deemed as unsafe/inappropriate for the park environment we can devise a plan for a safe introduction to the park area.</p>
      <p>“This may involve referral to a specialist behaviourist and we may advise that an indoor park environment at this stage is not the best place for your dog.”</p>
