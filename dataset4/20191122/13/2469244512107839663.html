      <p>Sleeping next to a snorer can seriously damage your health, science suggests.</p>
      <p>Those sleepless nights caused by the annoying nasal noises can lead to a range of physical, emotional and mental problems, for long suffering partners.</p>
      <p> Having a fractured sleeping pattern increases the risk of anxiety and depression, as well as our chances of developing obesity or suffering a stroke, so you've got science on your side next time you want to give a not-so-gentle prod to the person next to you, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/sleeping-next-someone-who-snores-20931824">reports The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Losing sleep can have a huge impact on our body's ability to recover and fulfill biological functions, like memory consolidation and regulating metabolism, as reported by <a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/according-to-a-study-sleeping-with-a-snorer-can-take-a-toll-on-your-health-794848/">Bright Side</a>.</p>
      <p>Those who don't get enough rest are prone to make more mistakes, think slowly and have a lower level of productivity - which isnt great news for your colleagues.</p>
      <p>And it should give cause for concern to the snorer too, as the problem is associated with constant irritability, which is likely to have an affect on your relationship.</p>
      <p>Your partner's snoring often interferes with your sleep and waking them up to make it stop will often upset them too, chipping away at your relationship little by little.</p>
      <p>A negative atmosphere at home can result in stress, inflammation, changes in appetite and even a weakened immune system causes by the constant arguing.</p>
      <p>Queen's University in Canada carried out a study to find the affects of snoring on hearing, using four couples in which one person in the relationship had severe sleep apnea.</p>
      <p>It found the sound didn't affect snorers much, but 100% of their partners suffered hearing damage equivalent to sleeping next to an industrial machine, especially in the ear closest to the snores.</p>
      <p>Loud noises can also raise blood pressure , as found in a study by the Imperial College of Science in London.</p>
