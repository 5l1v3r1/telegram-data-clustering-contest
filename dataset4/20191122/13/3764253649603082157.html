        <b>Jose Mourinho has moved to the second position behind Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola on the list of top 10 highest paid managers in the world.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United gaffer was named Tottehham manager this week after the club sacked Mauricio Pochettino who was in charge for five years.</p>
      <p>Before he got the job at Tottenham, Jose Mourinho was without a club for almost a year after being sacked at Manchester United in December 2018.</p>
      <p>After he was thrown out at Old Trafford, Jose Mourinho turned down some jobs and decided to be working as a pundit.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese was given a €17.5 million-per-year deal which is more than double what Pochettino earned at the club.</p>
