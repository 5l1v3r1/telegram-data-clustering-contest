      <p>The USD/CAD pair finally broke down of its daily consolidative trading range and tumbled to fresh session lows, around mid-1.3200s post-Canadian macro data.<br/> <br/>The pair extended previous session pullback from multi-week tops and witnessed some follow-through selling for the second consecutive session on Friday following the release of Canadian monthly retail sales figures.</p>
      <h3>Weighed down by upbeat Canadian data</h3>
      <p>Data released this Friday showed that headline sales recorded a modest 0.1% decline for the third consecutive month in September, while core sale (excluding automobiles) posted a stronger-than-expected growth of 0.2%.<br/> <br/>Against the backdrop of a subdued US dollar demand, this time weighed down by a fresh leg of a downfall in the US Treasury bond yields, further collaborated to the pair's slide back below the very important 200-day SMA.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, the downfall seemed rather unaffected by weaker oil prices, which tend to undermine demand for the commodity-linked currency <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad">loonie</a>, albeit might turn out to be the only factor that might lend some support.<br/> <br/>With Friday's key Canadian data out of the way, market participants now look forward to the US economic docket, featuring the release of flash <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Manufacturing PMI</a> and Michigan Consumer <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">Sentiment</a> Index, for a fresh impetus.</p>
