      <h3>Calgary better for faith leader’s work</h3>
      <p>After 10 years in Calgary and major advances in interfaith collaboration to his credit, Rabbi Shaul Osadchey is leaving town. He will be remembered as a strong force, encouraging good will and collaboration among different faith communities.</p>
      <p>I was honoured to work closely with Rabbi Osadchey during the first two years of the Habitat for Humanity Interfaith Build Project that raised $1 million. He was undaunted by the enormity of the task when I first met him to discuss an interfaith project to support working families struggling to afford housing.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Osadchey agreed to serve as co-chair of the Clergy Leadership Team comprised of Muslim communities, two synagogues, many Christian denominations and the Unitarian Church. As a direct result of his leadership, fundraising flourished as faith leaders collaborated with each other.</p>
      <p>He modelled generosity and respect towards other faiths while inviting me to learn more about the Jewish faith. He mentored me in my naïve efforts at fundraising. Without Rabbi Shaul Osadchey, there would be fewer deserving families enjoying their own home this Christmas.</p>

      <h3>Facts explain oil delivery constriction</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Puzzled over need to expand pipeline, Letters, Nov. 21</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Ron Robinson succeeds at anything, it is in demonstrating the need for Alberta to speak out against misinformation in the oil and gas industry.</p>
      <p>Citing both The Narwhal and economist Robyn Allan as “sources,” Robinson suggests that current capacity of TransMountain, Keystone XL, and Enbridge Line 3 is sufficient for Alberta exports.</p>
      <p>Here are some facts: TransMountain’s existing capacity is fully utilized serving B.C. requirements for refined fuels and Washington refineries’ (and one in Burnaby) requirements for crude oil; Enbridge Line 3 continues to operate at approximately 50 per cent capacity as the replacement project remains in U.S. regulatory purgatory; and the only oil exported by Keystone XL is in Allan’s overactive imagination.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Alberta continues to constrain production by about 175,000 bbls/d, and the CER reports over 300,000 barrels exported by rail in September (latest report).</p>

      <h3>Cutting every non-teaching position would still not meet shortfall</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Lagrange Says CBE Blindsided Her On Layoffs, Nov. 21</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even if the Calgary Board of Education fired (every executive, trustee, superintendent and non-teaching workers), it would not overcome the $32-million dollar shortfall.</p>
      <p>If Don Braid believes schools should work without any administration to oversee board operations and resource allocation, then yes, the CBE could fire almost everyone in the downtown office, but they still would not overcome the shortfall.</p>
      <p>Laying off 300 temporary contract teachers still does not overcome the $32-million by the way, not by a long shot. Other “padding reductions” are still being made. But there is only so much you can reduce after years of reducing.</p>
      <p>An independent audit was done in 2018 which found the same results. I am very curious as to what Lagrange thinks has so drastically changed since then.</p>
