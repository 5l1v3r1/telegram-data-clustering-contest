      <p>Following the conclusion of the Euro 2020 qualifiers earlier in the month, 20 teams have confirmed their participation in the tournament in June next year. </p>
      <p>Belgium, Italy, England, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, France, Poland, Switzerland, Croatia, Netherlands, Russia, Portugal, Turkey, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Czech Republic, Wales, and Finland are the nations who are guaranteed a spot at the European spectacle.</p>
      <p>There are still four remaining places available, however, which will be competed for between 26 and 31 March 2020, between the 16 nations who qualified for the play-offs via their Euro 2020 qualifying results and UEFA Nations League co-efficients. </p>
      <p>This year's play-off process differs from previous editions of the competition in that a different, single knock-out pathway to four unique finals has been created, from which the four winners will join the already-qualified nations. </p>
