      <h1>Outrage after TSB customers were not paid wages due to banking error</h1>
      <h2>One woman said she couldn't pay for the deposit on her flat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:03:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, Christopher Harper</a></address>
      <p>TSB customers were left without access to wages after the bank crashed last night.</p>
      <p>Customers have flooded to social media to claim they weren't been paid which included earnings, benefits and pensions.</p>
      <p>Kerry Louise <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-thousands-tsb-bank-customers-20934337">told the Mirror</a> said she's been unable to pay for a deposit on a flat this morning, waking up to "nothing" on the day her Â£900 payment is due.</p>
      <p>"I was expecting my wages this morning and woke up with nothing. I have an appointment before work to put a deposit down for a flat and now cannot do this.</p>
      <p>"TSB have ruined everything. I am heartbroken. There's been no explanation, no time limit or anything. This is happening too often and I will be changing banks after this. I cannot believe it," the customer explained.</p>
      <p>Another reader told us his wages haven't appeared, despite being issued by his employer, causing an "absolute nightmare".</p>

      <p>It comes just days after a damning report by law firm Slaughter and May criticised TSB's board for lacking "common sense" in the lead-up to last year's IT calamity after a systems upgrade went spectacularly wrong.</p>
      <p>A TSB statement on Friday, said the bank is experiencing some "delays".</p>
      <p>"Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket."</p>
      <p>If you've incurred any extra costs due to today's outage, keep hold of any receipts, call logs and invoices which you can use to make a claim once the issue has been resolved.</p>
      <p>The bank said that customers' cards are still working for payments and withdrawals, and that those who need emergency cash can get in touch using the number on the back of their cards.</p>
      <p>"If TSB customers need emergency cash or have any questions they can visit us in branch or contact us via the number on the back of their card," a statement added.</p>
      <p>"Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash."</p>
      <p>TSB said the issue was resolved at 12pm today.</p>
