      <h1>ECB's Weidmann: Monetary policy accommodation is still warranted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:03:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>The European Central Bank's <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> accommodation is still warranted given the weak growth and low inflation, ECB Governing Council member and Bundesbank President, Jens Weidmann, told a financial conference in Frankfurt on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Monetary policy cannot be complacent if its policy stance raises long-term risks to price stability through the build-up of financial imbalances," Weidmann added, per Reuters. "We should not be over-confident about the role macroprudential policy can play in addressing systemic risks. This policy approach is still in its infancy."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> pair's reaction to these remarks was muted and the pair was last seen trading at 1.1058, where it was virtually unchanged on a daily basis.</p>
