      <p>Geoffrey Simon Brown says we need the ghosts of Charles Dickens’ Victorian classic A Christmas Carol more than ever these days.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Brown was commissioned to write a new stage adaptation of the beloved holiday story to replace the one Theatre Calgary’s former artistic director Dennis Garnhum created in 2011.</p>
      <p>Given his edgy voice in plays such as The Circle, Air and Control and the avant-garde theatre company, Major Matt Mason that he helped create and runs, Brown seemed like an unlikely candidate to work on the family friendly show.</p>
      <p>“Both my parents are librarians. I come from a family that has a great love of literature and my reading tastes are very diverse and eclectic. I enjoyed the challenge of working on A Christmas Carol,” says Brown, who admits “though Dickens was not foreign to me, I wasn’t super well versed in him.</p>
      <p>“I was a fan of his David Copperfield and had read A Christmas Carol but my greatest reference for the story before I started working on my adaptation was The Muppet Christmas Carol,” he says, assuring us Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo will not be making appearances at the Max Bell Theatre.</p>
      <p>What excited Brown most about the commission from Theatre Calgary was that artistic director Stafford Arima told him “to go as crazy and wild as I wanted because they could always pull things back later.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been working on this adaptation for 19 months and submitting regular drafts and no one has pulled back very much at all. I feel this really is my vision and that’s what’s so exciting.”</p>
      <p>As soon as Brown began reading and rereading A Christmas Carol in earnest, he “began to see a lot of parallels between Dickens’ Victorian England and our current society.</p>
      <p>“Dickens was appalled at child labour practices in Victorian England but, just because we don’t have workhouses in Calgary, it doesn’t mean there aren’t kids on the other side of the world working in horrible conditions in factories. Our world has shrunk so these factories seem awfully close to us.”</p>
      <p>Brown says the recession that has hit Alberta”makes us see that poverty is no longer a completely foreign concept. This has made us more compassionate toward people who have fallen on hard times. This is what Scrooge had to learn to appreciate.”</p>
      <p>Something else that many people share with Scrooge is they “find it difficult to change their minds about things. Scrooge knew about the workhouses, prisons and poverty. He just didn’t think it should be any of his concern.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, he’s not alone in such thinking, which means we really need those ghosts these days. A visitation wouldn’t hurt any of us.”</p>
      <p>Brown says his biggest challenging in bringing A Christmas Carol from the page to the stage was trying to balance being true to Dickens’ dialogue and characters and expanding on what was in the text.</p>
      <p>“So much of Dickens’ dialogue is iconic. It’s been used for adaptations by everyone from Disney to Theatre Calgary. You have to be careful not to edit out the most famous of those lines. People will be waiting for them and you have to be true to the world Dickens created for his story.”</p>
      <p>He points out that, in several instances, tradition has actually trumped Dickens himself.</p>
      <p>“In adaptations, Scrooge’s one love Belle always shows up at the Fezziwig Christmas party but in the novella, you don’t see her until they break up and that famous line Scrooge gives Christmas morning to the boy in the street “You there, boy” is not in Dickens. As a writer, you have to decide where you’re going to be true to Dickens and where you’re going to honour tradition.”</p>
      <p>Brown discovered that the female characters in Dickens’ novella didn’t even have names. Alice Cratchit, as she has become known, was simply Bob’s wife “but that doesn’t work on stage and certainly not for me. I was determined to flesh out the female characters.”</p>
      <p>He also wanted to make Fezziwig and his wife “more human. They really are treated like caricatures. Modern audiences are looking for the humanity of characters they see on stage. I’ve even added some characters of my own,” says Brown.</p>
      <p>Audiences for Theatre Calgary’s A Christmas Carol, which runs Nov. 28 to Dec. 28, will not only experience a new adaptation but will see new sets and video images created by Scott Reid, all new costumes by Deitra Kalyn and songs and music by Allison Lynch.</p>
      <p>There will be one familiar face in this new production. Stephen Hair returns for his 26th outing as Scrooge.</p>
