      <p>THANJAVUR</p>
      <p>Tension prevailed for some time at the Thanjavur District Police Headquarters here on Friday as a woman serving as a Home Guard allegedly attempted to commit self-immolation.</p>
      <p>According to the police, Nirosha of Vandikara Street at Gorikulam here came to the DPO around noon along with her two sons. She suddenly pulled out a can containing inflammable liquid from the bag she was carrying with her and poured it on herself and on her two sons.</p>
      <p>On seeing her action, police personnel on duty rushed and thwarted her attempt. Nirosha and her sons were escorted to a safe place and on interrogation she claimed that her complaint about cheating by a neighbour forwarded to the Thanjavur taluk police from the DPO earlier had not been pursued by the taluk police. She was let off with a warning, police said.</p>
