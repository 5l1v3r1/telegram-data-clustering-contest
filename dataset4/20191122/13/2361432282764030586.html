      <h2>Dick Grayson’s post-Robin super-suit looks pretty great in live-action form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:14:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/ross/" target="_blank">Ross A. Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Fans of crime fighting orphans and black and blue tights, your ship has finally come in. On Thursday just ahead of next week’s Season 2 finale, DC Universe unveiled the super-suit that will be worn by Dick Grayson in his Nightwing persona during the third season of “Titans.” And we’ve got pics for you here.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, Nightwing is the superhero alias adopted by Dick Grayson, Batman’s original Robin, after he strikes out on his own. As originally depicted in a 1984 storyline by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, after six years as Robin, 19-year-0ld Dick has a falling out with Batman and is essentially fired. After some soul searching, he adopts the name Nightwing and continues to lead the Teen Titans (the group from which “Titans” takes its name) through some harrowing times.</p>
      <p>Following the 1985 crossover “Crisis on Infinite Earths” the character’s origin story was tweaked slightly (he was dismissed after being shot by the Joker), but he continues to lead the Teen Titans while occasionally popping up to help Batman in Gotham City. Eventually Grayson moves to the nearby city of Bludhaven, where in his civilian identity he joins the police department in order to battle corruption, and as Nightwing serves as the city’s official superheroic protector.</p>

      <p>The Season 2 finale of “Titans” airs Nov. 29, which means we’ll still have to wait a year to see how Brenton Thwaites, who plays Dick Grayson on “Titans,” will actually look in the costume. But you can see it on a super-buff mannequin in the photos below.</p>
      <p>First up, a side by side comparison of the show’s costume — which was designed by Laura Jean Shannon, and built by Creative Character Engineering — and how it currently looks in the comics.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Like a lot of comics-to-live action transitions, the “Titans” version is more like armor than high tech spandex, but Shannon and her team have preserved the essence of the comics version in some cool ways. I particularly like how the blue bird emblem still extends to the shoulders (see a closer look at the top of the page) — and of course who doesn’t love a good domino mask.</p>
      <p>Next, here’s a fuller look at the TV show’s version of the suit:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Of course, while the “Titans” version tracks pretty closely to how the outfit currently looks in the comics, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to find out that Nightwing’s costume has changed a lot in the 35 years since the superhero persona was introduced. And we mean, <i>a lot</i>. Allow me to introduce you to the very first version, from “Tales of the Teen Titans” issue 44:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>To be honest, I kind of have to insist that “Titans” put Dick Grayson in this magical example of 1980s pizzazz at some point, because it truly is, objectively, the best. Laura Jean Shannon, if you’re reading this, consider this a pathetic beg.</p>

          <figcaption><b>34. "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace" (1987)<br/></b>Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman. But "Superman IV" is a bomb in every sense -- partly because of its heavy-handedness about bombs. Nuclear bombs. The film finds Superman trying to eliminate the world's nuclear threat, but his best intentions run afoul of a silly, badly dated villain named Nuclear Man.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>33. "Supergirl" (1984)<br/></b>We had a female-superhero movie in 1984, and it was pure cheese. But hey, at least they tried. The best thing I can say about it is there are worse things in life than this movie.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>32. "Suicide Squad" (2016)<br/></b>Less a movie than it is a fever dream of unrelated sequences and montages that somehow end up using more than two hours of your time. Totally incomprehensible experience.<br/>And, no, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/does-suicide-squad-extended-cut-fix-movie-nope/">the extended cut doesn't do anything that warrants improving its standing</a>.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>29. "Man of Steel" (2013)<br/></b>Could have been worse, I guess. But it's still morally gross and has a plot that doesn't make sense. That it's very pretty to look at doesn't override those things nearly enough to make it watchable.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>26. "Batman &amp; Robin" (1997)<br/></b>Rightly hated, but it's tremendously entertaining here and there. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/uma_thurman/">Uma Thurman</a> and Arnold Schwarzeneggar are going so far over the top I can't help but admire them.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>25. "Superman III" (1983)<br/></b>Featured a brilliant corporate rip-off -- one later referenced in "Office Space" -- but the attempt to funny things up with the addition of <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/richard_pryor/">Richard Pryor</a> didn't gel. There was also a weird bit about a weather satellite creating bad weather, which isn't what weather satellites do. Seeing Clark Kent fight Superman was pretty cool, though.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>24. "Green Lantern" (2011)<br/></b>Overreliance on cartoony visual effects during a period when big blockbusters were moving away from that aesthetic meant this was a movie nobody liked. Not that it was especially horrible. It just looked like a dumb cartoon and is hard to watch.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>23. "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012)<br/></b>Probably wasn't intended to be a grim and gritty Shumacher Batmovie, but that is indeed what it is. This is Nolan going full Hollywood, smashing plot points into place by sheer force of will rather than because they make sense. An extremely theatrical <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/tom_hardy/">Tom Hardy</a> as Bane is amusing front to back, and a nuke with a countdown clock on it will never get old.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>22. "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (2016)<br/></b>A total mess that hates Superman and turns Batman into a total maniac. None of those things are good. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ben_affleck/">Ben Affleck</a> can't save the thing, but he's excellent nonetheless and gives it a huge bump it probably doesn't deserve.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>21. "Watchmen" (2009)<br/></b>I have no particular affection for the revered "Watchmen" comic the way a lot of other nerds do, so my distaste for this adaptation isn't personal. It just doesn't add up to nearly as much as it thinks it does.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>20. "Batman" (1989)<br/></b>Fondly remembered mostly because it was the first Batmovie in a couple decades. It isn't actually very good, though. The reveal that a younger version of the Joker killed Bruce Wayne's parents is as hamfistedly dumb as it gets in a "Batman" movie.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>17. "Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition" (2016)<br/></b>Giving this its own slot because it fundamentally changes the narrative of the movie and the character of Superman in the DC Extended Universe.

        <figure>

          <figcaption><b>14.

"Superman Returns" (2006)<br/></b>Actually a pretty decent attempt by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/bryan_singer/">Bryan Singer</a> to do a Christopher Reeve "Superman" movie in the present day, but <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/brandon_routh/">Brandon Routh</a> couldn't pull off the charisma it takes to be the Man of Steel. It was his first movie, so that's not surprising. But it's a shame, because Routh has gotten much better in the years since.</figcaption>

"The Dark Knight" (2008)<br/></b>Should be way shorter, but <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/heath_ledger/">Heath Ledger</a>'s Joker is far and away the best villain in any of these movies. Ledger elevates what would otherwise be just another self-indulgent <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christopher_nolan/">Christopher Nolan</a> exercise into an endlessly watchable picture.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>9. "Superman II" (1980)<br/></b>Made kids everywhere cry as they watched Superman give up his powers for a normal life with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). There are different edits of this movie, and we frankly can't keep them straight. But the sight of a powerless Clark getting beat up in a diner made Superman as sympathetic as he's ever been.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>8. "Wonder Woman" (2017)<br/></b>Has the standard origin movie problem of "too much story, not enough time." And the standard DC Extended Universe problem of "We gotta have a nonsensical CGI battle at the end." But despite those caveats it's an enormous delight, and a big step forward for the DCEU.</figcaption>

John Williams' score soars, and so does the believable and compelling romance between Superman and Lois Lane. The film convincingly blended camp (in the form of <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/gene_hackman/">Gene Hackman</a>'s wonderful Lex Luthor), an epic origin story that actually felt epic, and funny lines. The scene in which Supes and Lois fly together is one of the most beautiful metaphors for new love ever captured on film.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>2.

Watching it again recently, I found it functions almost perfectly as a parody of the super-serious <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christopher_nolan/">Christopher Nolan</a> Batfilms, which is incredible.</figcaption>
