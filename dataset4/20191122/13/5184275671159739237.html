      <p>“Yeah! Well, I used to jerk off to Leonardo DiCaprio… Uhh, like his acting. I used to have a HUGE crush on Leonardo DiCaprio. I had this huge poster of him from The Beach in my room, and there used to be, like, ‘Leo love books’… Do you remember? Like, right when Titanic came out [when I was] in like third or fourth grade, he was just like, ‘teen milk.’ There were love books and I had all of them. He was the coolest,” Davidson revealed, according to freepressjournal.in.</p>
      <p>Davidson also revealed that he has met Leonardo a couple of times. “I’ve met him twice and I’ve just shaken hands and run away fast,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Davidson has come out with a new magazine cover shoot. Posing in the nude, the comedian has been transformed into a Ken doll, reports metro.co.uk.</p>
