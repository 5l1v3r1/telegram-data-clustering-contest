    <meta property="og:description" content="Synology's DS218j isn't the most powerful NAS in its collection. In fact, it's one of the entry models for those who are new to NAS or require a low-power unit. If you fall into either of these camps, this is a solid deal for you to save on a new home server."/>

      <h1>Grab Synology's DS218j at a super-low price of £122 for today only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:21:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/author/Rich%20Edmonds" target="_blank">Rich Edmonds</a></address>
      <p>If you're on the fence for purchasing your first NAS, this DS218j from Synology is quite the deal right now for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a>. You'll be able to pick up one of the entry-level models from the company's NAS collection for just £122. What this server will allow you to do is create a home server where you can store all your personal files, stream media, and much more.</p>

      <p>A great NAS for someone starting out with their first home server or looking for a simple, low-powered file storage solution.</p>
      <h4>£122 <s>£151</s> £29 Off</h4>

          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076S8NSCD?tag=androcentr-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU72028YYw">See at Amazon</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unlike Synology's traditional all-metal NAS design, the Synology DS218j is a slim, well-designed slab of plastic. It's an enclosed chassis, rather than an open box with a removable drive bay. While this means you'll need to take apart the case to access installed hard drives, it results in a clean overall look and is ideal for those who won't frequently hot-swap drives.</p>
      <p>Because it's a relatively compact NAS, the power supply is not located within the unit. But that's not something to complain about since it's a small brick. There are no ports on the front — just your usual LED status indicator layout. The rear of the NAS houses the single fan, two USB 2.0 ports, LAN, as well as power input.</p>
      <p>If this isn't quite the NAS you're looking for, we expect to see other Synology models — as well as NAS from other vendors — go on sale this Black Friday.</p>
