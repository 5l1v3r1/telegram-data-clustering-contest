      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> 2019 is almost upon us, and even though the day itself isn’t until next week, big brands and online retailers have already started kicking off their sales and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/lidl-black-friday-deal-xbox-one-s-11194493/">offering major discounts</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/black-friday-2019-uk-11083628/">Friday 29 November is Black Friday</a> this year, but the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/john-lewis/">John Lewis</a> and many more have already <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/amazon-black-friday-2019-deals-start-date-11199654/">started slashing the prices on items</a> across their websites.</p>
      <p>To make sure you’re getting the best deal possible, check out our Black Friday hacks below for how to ensure you secure the best prices and biggest bargains on the products you want this year.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday hacks</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Sign up to your favourite brand’s newsletters</b>
      </p>
      <p>Get the best deals straight to your inbox when you sign up to hear from the brand’s you love directly. By joining a mailing list you will ensure that all the latest news and Black Friday deals being offered are sent straight to you, and you’ll get alerts if a sale starts early, gets extended or if items are reduced even further than originally advertised.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>If you don’t want to receive emails once Black Friday has passed, you can simply unsubscribe from the newsletters you no longer want by clicking the related link at the bottom of the emails. Normally you only need to unsubscribe once to no longer receive any emails.</p>

        <b>Know what you want before you shop</b>
      </p>
      <p>Much like going to the supermarket when you are hungry, not really knowing what kind of Black Friday bargains you’re looking for before browsing the thousands on offer online is a recipe for disaster.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/my-black-friday-2019-video-game-shopping-list-readers-feature-11071383/">Make a list</a> of things you need, want and are looking for as gifts and then search for those products specifically online or from your chosen brand or store. This way, you’ll be able to focus on getting the best deals and most money off bigger items, as opposed to getting distracted and spending money on impulsive purchases that may not be as good of a bargain.</p>

        <b>Use a price comparison website</b>
      </p>
      <p>When Amazon launched their first Black Friday sale in the UK back in 2010, there weren’t many other brands jumping on the bandwagon at the time, making the online retailer a one stop shop for the best bargains around.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>These days, there are literally thousands of offers to choose from, all from different stores and being offered by different brands. To ensure you’re getting the best deal (and the cheapest price going for the product you want) use a price comparison website like <a href="https://pricespy.co.uk/">Pricespy.co.uk</a>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pricespy-screenshot-5d4b.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C428&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Like any price comparison website, save time by letting them compare loads of different sites for you. (Picture: pricespy.co.uk)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Not only will the site show you how much a specific product is selling for across multiple sites, but it also tracks the price of that item over time – so you can see if you’re getting a hot Black Friday Deal that needs to be snapped up, or whether actually it’s sold for cheaper at another time of year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Double check delivery costs</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s all well and good securing a great discount on a product you want in a Black Friday sale, but there’s no point saving money to then just spend it on getting your item delivered.</p>
      <p>Many brands will offer free delivery on items over a certain amount, but make sure you double check this cost before you check out. Sometimes you can avoid pricey delivery fees by getting products sent to your local store for free so you can collect them – just maybe pick a day after Black Friday to pop in (you don’t want to be competing with the crowds after you safely shopped online to avoid the crush).</p>

        <b>Cash in on being a new customer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Black Friday deals can offer as much as 50 per cent off big brand products and more, but you can try to get even more off by bagging a discount for being a new customer too.</p>
      <p>Normally, if you haven’t shopped on a store’s website before, you can sign up to their email newsletter to get a percentage off your first purchase with them. Check the terms and conditions, but if this discount is valid with another offer, you’ll be able to add your new customer deal to a Black Friday offer for even more money off.</p>

        <b>Getting a better price with promo codes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don’t fancy signing up to receive a flurry of branded newsletters into your inbox? There is another way you could potentially get even more money off your Black Friday deals by using promotional codes.</p>
      <figure>
