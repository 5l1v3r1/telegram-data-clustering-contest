      <p>Lithuania's Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas Linkevicius has urged not to forget about the Holodomor, an act of genocide of the Ukrainian people during Joseph Stalin's reign.</p>
      <p>"Honoring the victims of [the] Holodomor, a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the brutal Stalin's regime 86 years ago. We must never forget crimes against humanity committed by the totalitarian regimes," he wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/LinkeviciusL/status/1197729979045470209">Twitter</a> on November 22, 2019.</p>
      <p><b>UNIAN memo</b>. In Ukraine, the Holodomor of 1932-1933 is designated as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people, perpetrated by the USSR government by organizing an artificial large-scale famine, which led to millions of deaths in rural areas in the then Ukrainian Soviet Republic.</p>
      <p>Holodomor Remembrance Day is annually marked on the fourth Saturday of November.</p>
