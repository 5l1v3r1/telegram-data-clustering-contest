      <p>Cape Town – As part of their work for Black History Month, children at Woodlands Community Primary School in Birkenhead, England wrote to Her Royal Highness, Duchess Meghan Markle – and she wrote them back!</p>
      <p>Head of correspondence, Claudia Spens, sent letters to the school on behalf of the duchess and wrote, "It was so thoughtful of you to take the trouble to write as you did. Their Royal Highnesses very much enjoyed their visit to Birkenhead and greatly appreciated the warm welcome they received.</p>
      <p>"I would be grateful if you could pass the enclosed envelopes to each child that wrote a lovely letter to Her Royal Highness."</p>

      <p>I think it’s safe to say the students were beaming!</p>
