      <h1>Icardi, Di Maria hand PSG victory on Neymar's latest return</h1>

        <b>Neymar made his latest comeback from injury for Paris Saint-Germain on Friday as first-half goals by Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria saw the Ligue 1 leaders ease to a 2-0 win over Lille at the Parc des Princes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The in-form<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-icardi-87988/"> Icardi </a>opened the scoring from close range in the <b>17th minute</b> with his 10th goal in<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/paris-saint-germain-fc/"> PSG</a>'s last nine games, and <b>Di Maria doubled their lead </b>just after the half-hour mark.</p>
      <p>Despite not being near their best, <b>Thomas Tuchel's side were too strong</b> for the team who finished runners-up behind them in France last season.</p>
      <p>After just 14 games, <b>PSG are 11 points clear of second-placed Marseille</b>, who play on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/neymar-64511/">Neymar</a> <b>had not played for his club since October 5</b>, having suffered a hamstring injury playing for Brazil in a friendly against Nigeria a week later.</p>
      <p>It was just the latest spell on the sidelines for the <b>world's most expensive player, </b>who has featured in barely half of PSG's matches since signing from Barcelona in August 2017.</p>
      <p>His decision to fly to Madrid to take in the Davis Cup tennis this week, just as<b> he was preparing to return to action</b>, did not go down well with Tuchel, but the German coach <b>still handed Neymar a start here.</b></p>
      <p>On just his sixth appearance of the campaign,<b> Neymar lasted a little over an hour before being replaced by Kylian Mbappe,</b> who was on the bench at kick-off having struggled with illness in recent days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>- Fresh for Real Madrid -</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neymar only produced brief glimpses of his class and headed straight to the dressing room after being taken off, with<b> some supporters jeering the 27-year-old as he departed.</b></p>

      <p>The main reason for his withdrawal, however, will have been <b>to keep him fresh for next Tuesday's trip to Real Madrid</b> when he will hope to make his first Champions League appearance of the campaign.</p>
      <p><b>Lille had beaten PSG 5-1 </b>at home when the sides last met in April, but they came here on a run of just one win in nine matches and <b>without an away victory since March.</b></p>
      <p>They were without their top scorer,<b> Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen due to suspension</b>, and coach Christophe Galtier had been left reeling when two of his assistants -- Portuguese duo Joao Sacramento and <b>Nuno Santos</b> -- left 48 hours before this game to team up with <b>Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur.</b></p>
      <p>They still almos<b>t took a second-minute lead through Xeka,</b> but the midfielder's shot was well saved by<b> Keylor Navas</b>.</p>
      <p>Instead it was<b> PSG who went in front from their first real chance,</b> with Icardi converting from close range at the far post after Jose Fonte had failed to cut out Idrissa Gueye's low ball from the right.</p>
      <p>Mike Maignan saved well from Gueye before the home side scored again in the 31st minute through another of their<b> Argentine contingent.</b></p>
      <p>Both <b>Di Maria and Icardi had scored in PSG's last game,</b> a 2-1 win at Brest, and both were fresh here having not featured in the Argentina squad for their recent friendly matches against <b>Brazil and Uruguay.</b></p>
      <p>On form they surely deserve to be playing for their country, however.</p>
      <p><b>Di Maria controlled a Julian Draxler pass </b>and confidently beat Maignan to make it 2-0. That was the end of the scoring, although Draxler and substitute <b>Edinson Cavani both squandered excellent second-half chances.</b></p>
