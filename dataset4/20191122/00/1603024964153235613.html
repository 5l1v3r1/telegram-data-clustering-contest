      <h1>CLSA sees Nifty at 13,700-13,800 levels if index surpasses its earlier high</h1>
      <h2>The sideways movement begun after the index rallied 1,300 points from 10,700 to around 12,000 in a span of just two months on the back of several government measures</h2>

      <p>The Nifty has been finding it tough to breach the psychological 12,000 mark on continuous profit booking around that level.</p>
      <p>In fact, it remains in consolidation mode for the third consecutive week and is trading between 11,850 and 12,000 levels.</p>
      <p>The sideways movement begun after the index rallied 1,300 points from 10,700 to around 12,000 in a span of just two months on the back of several government measures including a cut in the corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points.</p>
      <p>The recent September quarter earnings and cut in corporate tax rate made analysts confident about future corporate earnings growth.</p>
      <p>Laurence Balanco, Technical Analyst at CLSA, believes 12,070-12,118 should provide a platform for resumption of the market long-term uptrend. "A break above 12,070-12,118 would project an upside target of 13,700-13,800, with a shelf of support at 11,098-11,310 levels."</p>
