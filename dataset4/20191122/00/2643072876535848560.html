      <p>Speaking after the meeting which ended at about 11:30 pm, the National Chairman of the party, <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/adams-oshiomhole/"><u>Comrade Adams Oshiomhole</u></a></b>, said issues discussed during last night’s meeting include performance in the last elections, current issues, budget, court cases, and disciplinary matters.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole said, <i>“You know it’s a meeting of National Caucus. Basically, it is just to review the performance in the last elections, current issues, next year’s budget, and disciplinary issues. You know caucus is like an elders’ council to speak on a lot of things that we will discuss at NEC tomorrow (today).”</i></p>
      <p>The APC National Chairman who spoke for the first time after the statement by the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/13/just-in-apc-governors-give-adams-oshiomhole-ultimatum-to-resign-as-national-chairman/"><u><b>Salihu Mohammed Lukman</b></u></a> on how he was running the party, downplayed comments by Lukman.</p>
      <p><i>“There is no pressure. NEC meeting was scheduled like two months ago. We are just waiting for the day to come. It was fixed two months ago. And it is taking place tomorrow (today). Are you not aware of that? “You are talking of what Mr Salihu Lukman said. That is his opinion. Even before he said that, this meeting has been fixed. It is normal to hold a meeting”</i>, he said.</p>
      <p>“<i>We have a NEC meeting to look at our financial statements for previous year, budget for next year, issues that arose during and after the elections, and current outcomes of various cases that went to court; the one we won and the one we lost; going forward; issues in some states where we have disagreements and how to resolve the disagreements. I think that is it. And it went very well. And you can see the president sat all through the meeting.”</i></p>
