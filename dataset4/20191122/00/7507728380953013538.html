      <p>Netflix <i>might</i> have already found <b>Olivia Colman</b>'s successor on <i>The Crown</i>. </p>
      <p>Colman, who took over after <b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/claire_foy">Claire Foy</a></b> starred for two seasons, will continue to star through season four, but <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7712637/Imelda-Staunton-Claire-Foy-Olivia-Colman-Crown.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailceleb&amp;__twitter_impression=true">The Daily Mail</a> reports that <b>Imelda Staunton</b> will take over the role of Queen Elizabeth II in season five. </p>
      <p>Season three of <i>The Crown</i> just went live on Sunday, and covers the mid 60s to the Queen's Jubilee in 1977. Season four, which is currently filming, will include <b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/princess_diana">Princess Diana</a></b> and <b>Margaret Thatcher</b> and likely end in the mid 80s. </p>
      <p>It has always been the plan to recast the show every two seasons, but as Netflix reminded us when we asked for comment, a season five has not actually even been ordered yet. </p>

      <p>"We are currently filming season 4 of <i>The Crown</i> but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation," said a Netflix spokesperson to E! News.</p>
      <p>The official news of Olivia Colman's casting came just a couple of months before the release of season two, in December 2017, so we may not get confirmation on a season five cast for quite a while. </p>
      <p>Staunton, 63, is probably best known as Dolores Umbridge from <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, but she's also the voice of Aunt Lucy in <i>Paddington</i> and <i>Paddington 2</i>, and played Lady Bagshaw in the <i>Downton Abbey</i> movie. </p>
      <p><i>The Crown</i> currently stars Colman, <b>Tobias Menzies</b>, and <b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/helena_bonham_carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a></b>. Season 3 is now streaming on Netflix. </p>
