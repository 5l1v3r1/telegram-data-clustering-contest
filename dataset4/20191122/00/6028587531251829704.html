      <h1>Edmund McMillen Reflects On The Making And Future Of Kickstarted ‘The Binding Of Isaac’ Tabletop Game</h1>

      <p>Last year, Edmund McMillen, the creator of beloved indie titles such as <i>Super Meat Boy</i> and the recently released <i>The Legend of Bum-Bo, </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maxthielmeyer/2018/06/27/binding-of-isaac-card-game-announced-on-kickstarter-already-fully-funded/#40e97542272a">launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> to create <i>The Binding of Isaac</i>: <i>Four Souls, </i>a tabletop version of the highly acclaimed video game series.<i>The Binding of Isaac</i>: <i>Four Souls </i>replicates the solo <i>Binding Of Isaac </i>experience in a multiplayer tabletop setting where players compete against each other to defeat bosses and earn loot. The game captures the excitement of gaining abilities that interact in powerful ways and adds the additional challenges of battling against (or with) your fellow players.</p>

      <p>McMillen aimed to raise $50,000 to make the game a reality — a goal that was met and exceeded just<i> minutes</i> after launch. The game was released in November 2018 after raising over $2.65 million from 38,000 passionate fans who couldn’t wait to get their hands on a new way to play one of their favorite games.</p>
      <p>I had the chance to speak with Edmund McMillen about the game a year after launch, who said that these passionate fans were instrumental not just in funding the game, but also in the development of the game itself.</p>
      <p><b>Max Thielmeyer: </b>With the large amount of preorders and the success of the Kickstarter - does that add pressure to you, or how does it change your outlook on the whole project?</p>
      <p><b>Edmund McMillen: </b>The pressure was there for sure because <i>you can’t patch this game</i>. It’s a physical game, so it has to be perfect. There was a lot of making sure cards are worded correctly, and there was a lot of outsourcing too. Because there was so much fan involvement, we basically outsourced to fans: ‘Okay, you guys are super involved with this, here’s everything that’s going on behind the scenes, you can print it out and test it too.’</p>
      <p>It was cool, it was such an open back-and-forth with fans and I was super grateful for everybody’s help. It took the pressure off and made me feel a lot more confident, because if I was left to my own devices, everything would be misspelled and the words aren’t going to make any sense. It would be an atrocious mess.</p>
      <p>We even have a fan doing “tech support”. If I’m asleep and someone asks me a <i>Four Souls </i>ruling question, he will respond to them before I wake up. And he’s always right, this is his life - doing free tech support on Twitter for me, so I send him free copies of the games and stuff all the time.</p>

      <p><b>MT: </b>That sort of obsession from fans about basically everything you do is really unique, what do you think it is about what you do that creates such a tight knit community around your games that other creators don’t get?</p>
      <p><b>EM: </b>It may be something as simple as I’m really into what I’m doing, and I’m honest about it. There have been times where I haven't been 100% into the project that I’m releasing - its rare but it happens - and people can tell. You get this feeling, this aura of ‘if he doesn’t really like it then it probably wont be that good.’ That’s what I bring to the table, I only work on projects that I’m 100% in on. I’ve made a lot of mistakes when I was younger and worked on projects that I wasn’t 100% into, and it suffers. It suffers and people can see that very clearly.</p>
      <p>Really what made <i>Four Souls </i>special is because it fell out of the sky. Here’s this idea, I prototyped it in two weeks, I called [Studio71] up, they came down and two weeks later the Kickstarter starter. I didn’t even have time to think, so it was just ‘this is happening’, and I was <i>always </i>excited about it from the beginning all the way to the end.</p>
      <blockquote>It felt like only the good parts of developing a video game.</blockquote>
      <p>It was just design. And that’s what I do, just design and art direction. It’s easy and super fun for me to do, and I got to do a lot of live playtesting with my friends for hours and hours. This game felt like a party, I just had my friends over, we’d get pizza, we’d all play this game and talk and joke about it. They were all as invested as I was, and I could see instantly they’re smiling and having fun. It’s the most rewarding playtest ever.</p>
      <p>With video games, you sit around in a dark room for months, and then if you’re lucky and the game’s far enough along, you show it to one or two other developers who are all cold and have their arms crossed and are analyzing what you’re doing.</p>
      <p>With this, we’ve got a bunch of notecards that we’re editing on the fly. ‘Oh that’s a little over powered? Give me another card and I’ll draw it up. We’re going to play with this now, or with a new rule set.’</p>
      <p>It just felt like having fun with my friends, it didn’t feel like work. Which is why I did it, quite honestly. If it started to feel like work to me, I wasn’t going to be into it. It was a crazy experience but it was fun the whole time.</p>
      <p><b>MT: </b>Was it difficult to bring the <i>Binding of Isaac </i>experience to a tabletop game?</p>
      <p><b>EM: </b>It wasn’t hard and it was extremely fun. Again, this is my cup of tea, it’s like putting me in a room full of cake and I can never get sick. Almost all of my games I’ve made are references to something else that exists and I translate it into my own thing and make it work. It’s like I’m doing it now with my own work - can I deconstruct the design that I know so well, and turn it into something that is an enjoyable multiplayer experience?</p>
      <p><b>MT: </b>Something that’s really cool for me as a fan of <i>Isaac</i> is that the tabletop game sort of represents a physical manifestation of a video game that’s inherently digital. It’s something that I can point to and touch as a sort of testament to my enjoyment of the game. Is this a relationship you have with games, and do you feel the same way?</p>
      <p><b>EM: </b>I’m actually really into this sort of touch relationship and physical representations of my <i>own </i>games [laughing]. It was just as cool, if not a lot cooler for me to actually see it. I have every iteration of the box from testing to final and a bunch of cards that went through different phases, and my original prototype set. And of course, all the figures are lined up everywhere.</p>
      <p>There are times I’ve done things, merchandise-wise, where I wouldn’t make much money, or any money at all off of - one time lost money off of making <i>Super Meat Boy </i>stress balls [laughing] but I just do it because as a kid I thought ‘it would be so cool for one day, something that I did to have a toy’. So I really love that physical stuff. And working in the digital realm, nothing feels permanent. Which is why I still do physical retail releases; having a tangible thing makes something feel real, so it was definitely an extra incentive to [make <i>The Four Souls], </i>to achieve that dream.</p>

      <p><b>MT: </b>Where do you see yourself taking the game in the future?</p>
      <p><b>EM: </b>There are things that I played around with that got cut originally, like room modifications and other mechanics that sort of break the game a little bit and create tension between players. Like player rivalries or cards that force other players to side with you. There’s a lot of politics, essentially, that go in the games. People like to play it really safe, and it becomes a Monopoly-length game until somebody basically gets an “auto win” on the table.</p>
      <p>With the expansion I want to force people more into interactions with other players both negative and positive. so you automatically force people in to ‘you’re on my team now’ or ‘you're not’. I want a player method of being able to attack other players as monsters, so you can choose to attack a player. But i’m still playing around wit those of course.</p>
      <p>I’m hoping maybe, that middle to end of next year we’ll have enough sketched out that we can possibly do another Kickstarter. The number one thing we need is a bigger box, and there’s a lot of stuff we didn’t know people want more of like the nickel-sized coins and dimes. With some of the mechanics I want to do, I want to do them with different D6’s, and a lot of other extras. And a lot of fluff too, people want more figures, more plushies, more t-shirts, and more swag in general. I want to do “more game”, I don’t want to break things completely.</p>
      <p>If we did another Kickstarter we could put [the Kickstarter-exclusive cards] out again, and give everyone else an opportunity to get in on what everybody had gotten before. There’s a lot of different reasons why I want to do more on Kickstarter again.</p>
