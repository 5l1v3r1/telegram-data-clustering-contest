      <h1>Roger Stone allowed to travel to Florida for Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jeff-mordock/" target="_blank">Jeff Mordock</a></address>
      <p>A federal judge Friday granted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Roger Stone</a> permission to travel to Florida for Thanksgiving, possibly his last as a free man with a potential prison sentence looming.</p>
      <p>Judge Amy Berman Jackson approved the request continent upon <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a> providing a copy of his itinerary with Pretrial Services.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> requested permission to travel to Orange Park, Florida, which is outside the areas in Florida he is currently allowed to travel.</p>
      <p>A jury last week convicted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a>, a longtime associate of President Trump, on seven criminal counts, including making false statements, obstruction and witness tampering. Jurors concluded <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a> lied to obstruct a Congressional probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
