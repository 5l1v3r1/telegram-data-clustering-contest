      <p>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) - A teenager has been indicted on a capital murder charge in the May shooting of a Biloxi police officer.</p>
      <p>Darian (DEHR-uhn) <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tawan-atkinson/">Tawan Atkinson</a> has been jailed without bail since his arrest after Robert McKeithen was shot to death in the parking lot of the Biloxi police station.</p>
      <p>News outlets report no date has been set for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tawan-atkinson/">Atkinson</a>’s arraignment. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tawan-atkinson/">Atkinson</a> could face a death sentence if convicted.</p>
      <p>A detective said earlier the suspect walked 8 miles (13 kilometers) from his mother’s home to the Biloxi police station with the goal of killing a police officer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tawan-atkinson/">Atkinson</a> was arrested later when an off-duty Biloxi officer spotted him walking along a road in Wiggins. Police say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tawan-atkinson/">Atkinson</a>’s brother drove him there.</p>
