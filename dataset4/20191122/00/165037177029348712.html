      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/d-costa-28178/">Diego Costa</a> has left hospital after he <b>underwent successful surgery on a neck injury</b>, Atletico Madrid have confirmed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/atletico-madrid/">Atletico</a> said this week that<b> </b>the striker had gone under the knife after tests found he had suffered <b>a cervical disk herniation.</b></p>
      <p>Brazil-born Spain international Costa was <b>discharged on Friday</b> after his operation but is <b>expected to be out of action for up to three months.</b></p>
      <p><b>"The functional recovery period is to begin after a few days of rest,</b>" said a short Atletico statement.</p>
      <p>Costa has<b> scored twice in 15 appearances</b> in all competitions this term, having struggled to match the initial impact of new signing <b>Joao Felix</b> or the recent form of <b>Alvaro Morata.</b></p>
