      <p>Books make excellent holiday gifts. They manage to be elegantly simple yet charmingly personal at once. They spread art, knowledge, ideas and inspiration that goes far beyond the four corners of a page. Some of the best books to cross my desk this season are visually focused, with artistic layouts and world-class photography. They are substantial and full of texture both in merit and to the touch. They feel as if they pass along a body of work, yet are approachable to a paragraph. The are global, diverse, wide-reaching.</p>
      <p>These are books that belong out on the counter, to thumb through when a free moment emerges or when one is begging inspiration to strike. They are also suitable to satisfy a household with a balance of precision and general interest.</p>
      <p>Here are four of my suggestions for holiday gift giving, and of course, you’ll require a copy for yourself:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/251121/alpine-cooking-by-meredith-erickson/9781607748748/"><b>“Alpine Cooking: Recipes and Stories from Europe's Grand Mountaintops” </b></a>by Meredith Erickson (Ten Speed Press, Penguin Random House, $50) is 350 pages, 80 recipes and 200 photographs worth of temptation. This book is absolutely beautiful, an immersion into the countries of the Alps. Erickson also includes a list of Alpine wine producers to seek out, including a few of my favorites: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillbarth/2019/03/15/alois-lageder-biodynamic-winemaking-in-italys-alto-adige/#1533a8e7b6a6">Alois Lageder</a>, <a href="https://jillbarth.wordpress.com/2017/01/20/the-biodynamic-vineyards-of-savoie/">Jacque Maillet</a> and <a href="http://www.vins-nicolas-gonin.com/en/domaine-nicolas-gonin-winegrower-vintner-winemaker-france-igp-isere-balmes-dauphinoises.html">Nicolas Gonin</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.papress.com/html/product.details.dna?isbn=9781616898489"><b>“Vineyards”</b></a> is a stunning collection of photographs by Fred Lyon (Princeton Architectural Press, $40). The book captures 70 years’ worth of Lyon’s vineyard travels through France, Chile, Italy, Germany and beyond. Special attention is paid to his Northern California home, the counties of Napa and Sonoma. While each image packs a punch, I found Lyon’s capture of Côte-Rôtie  to be particularly fascinating.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.murdochbooks.com.au/browse/books/cooking-food-drink/national-cuisines/Hong-Kong-Food-City-Tony-Tan-9781760522698"><b>“Hong Kong Food City” </b></a>by Tony Tan (Murdoch Books, $29.99) is filled with 80 contemporary and traditional recipes, shared with a perspective of Hong Kong’s “history, culture, cooking styles and social norms.” There is a travel component as well, and the photographs are vibrant and evocative mirroring the richness of this varied community. I particularly found Tan’s segment on pantry staples to be helpful.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Looking-Up-Catherine-McCormack/dp/0711242178"><b>“The Art of Looking Up”</b></a><b> </b>(White Lion Publishing, $40) by Catherine McCormack deepens our perspective of 40 of the most artistic, fascinating and iconic ceilings around the world. Segmented by theme—Religion, Culture, Power and Politics—this book also has a superb set of fold-outs that provide sweeping and detailed perspective. Sweden’s Metro Stations were one of my favorite features, a playful collection of underground art.</p>
