      <h1>DStv without a decoder planned for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/hanno-labuschagne" target="_blank">Hanno Labuschagne</a></address>
      <p>MultiChoice will soon start testing DStv Now as a standalone service.</p>
      <p>The on-demand platform is currently only available as part of a DStv subscription, which requires a connected decoder and satellite dish.</p>
      <p>MyBroadband spoke to MultiChoice Connected Video CEO Niclas Ekdahl about the company’s plans to launch a standalone DStv Now offering during the company’s Media Showcase in Sandton.</p>
      <p>He said that although the company has been working on a decoder-less product for a while, it is important that the platform is well-optimised before launch.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think the user experience was up to scratch to deliver what the end consumers would expect,” said Ekdahl.</p>
      <p>DStv Now has since added several improvements, which include the introduction of user profiles, watchlists, and recommendations.</p>
      <p>“I think the stuff that we’ve done on DStv Now in the past 12 months is actually bringing us much closer to saying that ‘Yeah, this is a service where I can stand behind’, and say that this is going to be delivering a seamless user journey for our consumers,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also confirmed that the launch of a standalone DStv Now platform is expected before the end of March 2020, after external testing is done.</p>
      <p>“We are about to hit field trials, and I think we announced last year that we will be rolling it out within this fiscal year, so that’s still our plan.”</p>
      <h3>Big growth in OTT services</h3>
      <p>MultiChoice’s interim results <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/327143-big-growth-in-showmax-and-dstv-now-users.html"><b>revealed</b></a> a year-over-year increase of 48% in the monthly active users of its Showmax and DStv Now platforms in Africa.</p>
      <p>Ekdahl said he anticipates that these services will continue to perform well.</p>
      <p>“I think the OTT services will continue to have a healthy growth going forward,” Ekdahl said.</p>
