      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST)</b> —  An Indiana dad died after he plunged four stories from the balcony of a Carnival cruise ship, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Brian Rice, a father of two from Brownsburg, died Friday at sea on the Carnival Horizon near Miami returning from a six-day trip to the Caribbean, the Indianapolis Star reported.</p>
      <p>Police said he fell from a ninth-floor balcony to a deck below on the cruise, where medical staff rendered aid before he succumbed to his injuries.</p>
      <p>The medical examiner said he died from blunt force trauma, and ruled his death an accident, according to USA Today.</p>
      <p>The cruise line said it began cooperating with authorities Saturday when the vessel returned to the Port of Miami.</p>
      <p>“Our CareTeam continues to provide support to the guest’s family and we cooperated with the standard law enforcement investigation when the ship arrived to PortMiami on Saturday morning,” Carnival said in a statement, according to the Indianapolis Star.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe page was launched to provide financial support to his wife and twin 3-year-old boys.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who knew Brian knows how easy it was to call him a friend,” the page said. “He was the most generous person we knew. He’d give the shirt off his back for a stranger and drop everything to help a friend in need.”</p>
      <p>His death comes after 18-month-old Chloe Weigand fatally fell July 7 from an open window on a Royal Caribbean cruise, which was docked in Puerto Rico.</p>
