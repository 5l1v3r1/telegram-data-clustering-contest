      <p>Investing.com -- Here is a summary of regulatory releases from the London Stock Exchange on Friday, 22nd November. Please refresh for updates.</p>
      <p><b>Land Securities </b>(LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/land-securities">LAND</a>) said it has appointed Mark Allan to be its new chief executive officer. Allan is currently CEO of <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/uk-250">FTSE 250</a> member <b>St. Modwen Properties</b> (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/st-modwen-property">SMP</a>) Plc, a role he has held since 1 November 2016. TSt Modwen shares have risen over 50% during his tenure.</p>
      <p>Allan will make the move at the end of May.</p>
      <p>Online estate agent <b>Rightmove </b>(LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/rightmove">RMV</a>) said meanwhile that it has appointed former Shazam CEO and chairman Andrew Fisher as its new chairman. He'll succeed Scott Forbes at the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Software group <b>Playtech</b> (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/playtech-limited">PTEC</a>), which sells its services mainly to the gambling and spread betting industries, warned that full-year earnings are likely to be below consensus due to “highly challenging” conditions for its TradeTech unit and cut-throat competition in Asia.</p>
      <p>The company said it’s “evaluating all options” for TradeTech and is also reviewing the Casual and Social Gaming business.</p>
      <p>Playtech (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/playtech-limited">PTEC</a>) said it now expects full-year EBITDA to be “a little below current consensus”, as its problems with TradeTech have been partly offset by a continued strong performance from the B2B Gambling and Snaitech units.</p>
      <p>Revenue from Asia, where it has tried to expand market share in recent months is seen at 115 million a year at current run rates. It said market conditions are “highly competitive”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/uk-250">FTSE 250</a> precious metals specialist Hochschild Mining (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/hochschild-min">HOCM</a>) cut its forecast for output next year due to delays in obtaining permissions at the Pallancata mine in Peru.</p>
      <p>Overall output is now seen as 432,000 gold equivalent ounces or 35 million silver equivalent ounces. That’s down from 457,000 and 37 million, respectively, this year.</p>
      <p>“We have decided to give our brownfield exploration team more time to deliver additional resources,” CEO Ignacio Bustamante said.</p>
      <p>Hochschild also expects costs to rise as a result of a one-off $22 million project to increase tailings capacity at the flagship Immaculada mine. The all-in sustaining cost from operations in 2020 is expected to be between $1,015 and $1,045 per gold equivalent ounce, or $12.5 and $12.9 per silver equivalent ounce.</p>
      <p>Overall capital expenditures are seen at $115-$130 million, including the tailings project.</p>
