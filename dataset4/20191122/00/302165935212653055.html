      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 22 — A 20-year-old man has been handed seven charges, including taking two photographs of a male student showering in a residential hall at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and making obscene films.</p>
      <p>Lau Jun Wei, whose occupation was not made known, returned to a district court on Wednesday (Nov 20) for a further mention of the case.</p>
      <p>Lau was charged last month with three counts of criminal trespass and one count of causing distress to the student.</p>
      <p>He is also facing three charges under the Films Act, for making obscene films at Jurong Point shopping mall.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NTU incident</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Singaporean, who is neither a student nor an employee of the university, is accused of trespassing into an NTU hostel on three separate days this year:</p>
      <p>Feb 24, at about 5.20pm</p>
      <p>April 16, at about 7.15pm</p>
      <p>April 21, at about 12.30pm</p>
      <p>Court documents showed that Lau allegedly took the photos on April 21. The alleged victim cannot be named due to a court order to protect his identity. </p>
      <p><i>TODAY</i> previously reported that several students helped to detain Lau that day at Hall of Residence 3.</p>
      <p>An NTU spokesperson said then that closed-circuit television cameras cover most of the common areas in residential halls. Campus security guards also regularly patrol the halls and are stationed at every hall from 9pm to 9am.</p>
      <p>If convicted of causing distress to the student under the Protection from Harassment Act, Lau could be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$5,000, or both.</p>
      <p>Criminal trespass carries a maximum punishment of three months’ jail and a fine of S$1,500. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Obscene films</b>
      </p>
      <p>Separately, Lau is accused of using his mobile phone to film a man masturbating another man in a toilet at Jurong Point on July 14 last year, at about 9pm.</p>
      <p>He is also accused of making two films of himself masturbating a man in a toilet at the same mall on April 3.</p>
      <p>First-time offenders convicted of making an obscene film under the Films Act could be jailed up to two years, fined up to S$40,000 or both. Repeat offenders could be jailed up to two years, fined up to S$100,000 or both.</p>
      <p>Lau remains out on bail of S$5,000 and will return to court on December 11. — TODAY</p>
