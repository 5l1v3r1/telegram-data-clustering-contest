      <p>Imelda Staunton has reportedly been cast as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth</a> in The Crown, taking over the role from Olivia Coleman.</p>
      <p>Olivia is currently starring in the third series of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> hit opposite Tobias Menzies as her husband Prince Philip.</p>
      <p>She originally replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/claire-foy/">Claire Foy</a> who played the Queen in series one and two with Matt Smith as Prince Philip.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7712637/Imelda-Staunton-Claire-Foy-Olivia-Colman-Crown.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailceleb">According to Mail Online</a> Imelda, 63, will star in seasons five and six after being ‘approached by senior producers and casting directors to play the Queen from her mid-60s on’.</p>
      <p>The series are likely to span the queen’s reign throughout the 90s, including 1992 which she famously called her ‘annus horribilis’.</p>
      <p>It was the year Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson separated and Princess Anne divorced Captain Mark Phillips.</p>
      <p>The period of time covered is also likely to include the deaths of Princess Diana in 1997, and Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother in 2002.</p>
