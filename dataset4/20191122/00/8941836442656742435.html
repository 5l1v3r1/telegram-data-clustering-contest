      <p>BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) — Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has arrived at a Pennsylvania courthouse to be resentenced.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Sandusky smiled as he was escorted into Centre County Court on Friday in Bellefonte with his hands handcuffed in front of him.</p>
      <p>When a reporter asked him whether he maintains his innocence, he responded with, “absolutely.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-sandusky/">Sandusky</a> was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years.</p>
      <p>An appeals court said mandatory minimum sentences had been improperly applied against him.</p>
