      <h1>Samsung Galaxy A71 renders show off punch-hole display and quad-rear cameras</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:16:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>With the launch of the Galaxy S10 series early this year, Samsung introduced a new solution to house the front-facing camera on its devices — punch-hole displays. Instead of featuring a notch, Samsung’s flagships just had a small cutout at the top of their display for the selfie shooters. This new type of display also made an appearance on the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review/">Galaxy Note 10</a> series, along with several devices from other manufacturers. Earlier this month, we saw <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-show-48mp-quad-rear-cameras-punch-hole-display/">leaked renders of the upcoming Galaxy A51</a> which revealed that the device will also feature a punch-hole display. It seems like Samsung is convinced that punch-hole displays are the future because the company has reportedly included one on another upcoming smartphone.</p>
      <p>Reputed leakster @OnLeaks has now shared high-resolution CAD renders of the Galaxy A71, showcasing a punch-hole display. The device, which is a slightly upgraded version of the Galaxy A51, features a similar design with a slightly larger display. The device packs in a quad-camera setup on the back which is arranged in an L-shape within a rectangular module.</p>

      <p>Other than the camera module, the back of the device looks pretty clean with its rounded edges and the Samsung logo in the center. The volume rocker and power button can be found on the right edge of the device, while the SIM card slot is on the left. Additionally, the device includes a USB Type-C port at the bottom, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a single speaker grille. On top of that, the lack of a physical fingerprint scanner leads us to believe that the device will feature an in-display fingerprint scanner.</p>

      <p>The renders also reveal that the Galaxy A71 will feature a large 6.7-inch display and its overall dimensions are around 163.5 x 76 x 7.9mm. However, the camera bump slightly increases the device’s thickness to 9.2mm. As of now, we have no word on the internal specifications of the device, but we expect to learn more as the launch draws closer.</p>
