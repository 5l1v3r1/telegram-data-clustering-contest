      <h1>RNC spent big on Trump Jr. book ‘Triggered’ prior to debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/andrew-blake/" target="_blank">Andrew Blake</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">Republic National Committee</a> helped make “Triggered” a best-selling book for Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, Federal Election Commission records showed Thursday.</p>
      <p>FEC disclosures showed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a> paid $94,800 to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/books-a-million/">Books-a-Million</a> bookstore chain for “donor mementos” on Oct. 29, a week prior to “Triggered” being released and quickly becoming a bestseller.</p>
      <p>The purchase was made the same day the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a> sent out a fundraising email offering signed copies of “Triggered” in exchange for a minimum contribution of $50.</p>
      <p>“This limited-time opportunity ends SOON, so be sure to claim your signed copy of my new book NOW,” the younger Trump wrote in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a>’s fundraising email last month.</p>
      <p>The first son’s first book, “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,” subsequently debuted at number one on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. That listing was accompanied by a dagger icon, indicating some retailers reported sales categorized as “[i]nstitutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases.”</p>

      <p>The FEC filing was first <a href="https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/1197599033503756288">spotted</a> by a reporter for The New York Times on Twitter who recalled that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a> previously denied having purchased the president’s son’s book in bulk.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a> did not immediately return a related inquiry from The Washington Times.</p>
      <p>Book-a-Million currently sells copies of “Triggered” through its website for about $23, or less than the half of the cost of an autographed copy obtained through the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a>.</p>

        <p>“We have netted $500,000 for the party fundraising off the book,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republic-national-committee/">RNC</a> spokesperson Michael Joyce told BuzzFeed News, the website <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/donald-trump-jr-book-purchase-rnc">reported</a> Thursday.</p>
