      <p><i>The Dragon Prince </i>just keeps getting better.Season 3 of this epic tale of magical elves, gargantuan dragons, and an ancient enmity between the races of men and the magical creatures of Xadia only pushes the story further and deeper while expanding the world ever wider, and solidifying <i>The Dragon Prince </i>as one of the great animated fantasies of our time.</p>
      <p>Oh, and it has literally the cutest baby dragon you will ever see. No joke.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Some spoilers for Season 1 and 2 follow–I will keep this review spoiler free for Season 3.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>The Story So Far</h3>
      <p>In Season 1, the world and its conflict was established, along with a cast of interesting, often complicated characters. We learned that the magical land of Xadia and the human kingdoms had long been enemies. Things only got worse when the humans of Katolis killed the Dragon King.</p>
      <p>Bit by bit over the course of the next two seasons we learned more about just what happened in the backstory. The elves of Xadia believed the humans had destroyed the egg of the Dragon King and Queen, but they had in fact stolen it instead. When the Moonshadow Elves attacked, looking for vengeance against the King Harrow of Katolis (Luc Roderique) their mission appeared to be a success–though we never saw a body.</p>
      <p>Chaos ensued, and Harrow’s two children–his young son and heir Ezren (Sasha Rojen) and older step-son Callum (Jack De Sena)–left with the egg of the Dragon Prince and an unlikely companion, Rayla (Paula Burrows)–a Moonshadow Elf assassin.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They were pursued both by their aunt, General Amaya (who is deaf) as well as the children of the dark mage, Lord Viren (Jason Simpson). Claudia (Racquel Belmonte) is a dark mage apprentice, though far more lighthearted than her father. Soren (Jesse Inocalla) is a somewhat dim kings guard.</p>
      <p>What follows is a grand adventure that constantly upends our expectations of both the characters and the deep, rich history of the fantastical world that creators Aaron Ehasz and Justin Richmond have crafted so lovingly.</p>
      <p>By the end of Season 2 we have a mounting conflict between the races of men and elves. We have a baby dragon, Zym. Callum has become the first human (that we know of) to tap into elemental magic rather than dark magic. Up to this point, only elves and other magical creatures could use magic. Humans had to sacrifice magical creatures to harness dark magic. Somehow Callum figures out how to tap into air magic.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, his relationship to Rayla has grown noticeably closer. Ezren and Zym have a bond that goes beyond mere closeness, with the two actually looking like one another, and even sensing one another over great distances. And the loyalties of Claudia and Soren–torn between the boys and their power-hungry father–have been tested.</p>
      <p>Lord Viren himself has attempted to take power in Katolis, and urged the other four human kingdoms to go to war. He meets a mysterious Startouch elf named Aravos (Erik Dellums) who he finds when gazing into a magic mirror that once belonged to the Dragon King and Queen. Aravos reeks of evil, and we learn that he’s imprisoned somewhere, though he does not know where.</p>
      <p>Viren himself is eventually imprisoned by the remaining powers-that-be in Katolis, though he continues to speak with Aravos by way of a strange little caterpillar that speaks with Aravos’s voice in his ear.</p>

      <p>At the end of Season 2, Ezren abandons the quest to bring Zym to the Dragon Queen, leaving the Dragon Prince with Callum and Rayla, who continue toward Xadia. Ezren heads back to Katolis to take his rightful place on the throne, accompanied by the tracker, Corvus (Omari Newton).</p>
      <p>Claudia and Soren also return. Soren had been paralyzed in a battle with a dragon, and Claudia heals him with dark magic. Soren tells her about what their father instructed him to do–kill the princes–but she doesn’t believe him. They, too, return to Katolis.</p>
      <p>And that’s pretty much where things leave off, though I’m obviously skipping over a ton of details in this brief recap.</p>
      <h3>Season 3</h3>

      <p>Season 3 continues to weave all these various conflicts and adventures together. It’s truly epic. Every character grows in some way, and the backstory and lore only deepens.</p>
      <p>We learn more about exactly what happened between King Harrow, Lord Viren and the Dragon King. And we learn more about the mysterious Aravos, though he remains plenty mysterious by the time the credits role.</p>
      <p>We also get to see a lot more of Xadia, the magical land of the elves and dragons, and it’s at times breathtakingly beautiful and at times simply adorable–well, the creatures are adorable. Zym and Bait continue to be the most adorable, but these little puffball things that Claudia is looking at are pretty darn cute.</p>

      <p>What I love about <i>The Dragon Prince </i>is that it’s never really a show about black and white, pure good vs pure evil. The characters are complex. Sure, some of them are less complex than others. Ezren is clearly a good soul. Callum and Rayla are, too.</p>
      <p>But what about Claudia and Soren? They’re loyal to their father, but they aren’t wicked by any means. Even Viren is more complicated than just “evil dark mage trying to conquer the world” though his growing bond with Avaros sends him further and further down that path.</p>
      <p>Family ties are tested, and old histories dig up new wounds.</p>
      <p>I love that a show ostensibly for children (though I think it’s top-notch for all ages) can have such wonderfully complicated characters and conflicts. The lore and backstory are also so rich that the past is almost as fascinating as the present, perhaps more so. Or rather, the mysteries of the past make the present adventure that much more exciting and intriguing.</p>
      <p>That’s a trick George R.R. Martin did very well in <i>A Song Of Ice And Fire </i>and it works just as well here.</p>
      <p>As we learn more about King Harrow and the Dragon King and the ancient powers that loom behind everything, we gain sympathy in surprising places. And characters who once seemed fairly two-dimensional, suddenly find hidden depths.</p>

      <p>Each season of <i>The Dragon Prince </i>is just 9 episodes long, but what this allows the show to do is tell a fairly complete story each season. Season 3 wraps up what is essentially a three-season arc, though the story is far from over. Still, it ends in a very satisfying way with plenty of resolution, but also plenty left unanswered and a great cliffhanger.</p>
      <p>Think of each season as one long movie. Nine episodes of 20ish minutes per gives us 180 minute seasons, or about a three hour movie. The show’s creators noted how that makes each season about the length of one <i>Lord of the Rings </i>film. So three seasons gives us the full trilogy, and it’s every bit as epic.</p>
      <p>But it’s not over–there are more seasons, and a video game, in the works.</p>

      <p>Other things I love about <i>The Dragon Prince, </i>especially in Season 3 include the dragons themselves. These are some of the most majestic, beautiful dragons I’ve seen in any show, and a part of me wishes I could be my son’s age again, watching this show with the eyes of a nine-year-old.</p>
      <p>The animation continues to improve as well, though I think the leap between Season 1 and 2 was more apparent. It’s a beautifully realized TV show, with really cool magical creatures, lots of different types of elves like Sunfire Elves and Skywing Elves, all with their own magic and different accents (the Sunfire Elves are French; the Moonshadow Elves are Scottish, etc.)</p>

      <p>In Season 3, we’re introduced to several new characters as well, all of whom play an important role in the season’s story.</p>
      <p>Here’s the young and oh-so-serious prince of Neolandia, Kasef:</p>

      <p>And here’s a Skywing Elf surrounded by some truly terrifying creatures our heroes encounter in Xadia’s less hospitable regions:</p>

      <p>Like Ehasz’s previous show, <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Dragon Prince </i>weaves a complex narrative where good and evil isn’t always as clear as it seems. What follows is a story that’s entertaining, funny, heartfelt and often surprising. Season 3 doubles down on all the show’s best qualities, and gives us a satisfying conclusion to the first three-season arc.</p>
      <p>As the title suggests, I think it’s one of the best fantasy shows on TV, and I’m not simply referring to show’s for kids. As a huge fan of <i>The Last Airbender </i>and <i>The Legnd of Korra, </i>I am beyond pleased to have another fantasy show made for families that doesn’t hold hands or make everything easy to understand. I like not knowing for sure where any of this is going, and I like that I can sympathize even with characters like Lord Viren, despite his myriad flaws.</p>
      <p>Characters are constantly presented with hard choices and difficult bargains, and even the kindest soul is faced with problems that good intentions can’t always solve. This leads to organic conflict and some truly epic adventure. I know that my entire family found ourselves completely hooked throughout Season 3 (which I had screeners for) and already eager for Season 4. (The problem with Netflix screeners is you finish the show before it’s even out!)</p>
      <p>If you haven’t watched <i>The Dragon Prince </i>yet, do yourself a favor and add it to your queue. If you’ve watched and couldn’t get pulled in, give it another go. It’s very much worth your time.</p>
      <p>And for those of you who are eagerly awaiting Season 3’s Friday release, I think you’re in for a treat. I can’t wait to hear what you think about it, so hit me up on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/erikkain/">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/erikkainwriter/">Facebook</a> and we can talk <i>The Dragon Prince </i>to our hearts content.</p>
      <p>Another great Netflix fantasy show that released earlier this year was <i>The Dark Crystal: Age Of Resistance. </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/08/29/the-dark-crystal-age-of-resistance-review-a-true-masterpiece/#38896fb57b9f">Read my review of that show here.</a></p>
