      <h1>Dortmund captain Marco Reus blasts ‘shameful’ performance</h1>

      <p>BERLIN (AP) - Borussia Dortmund captain <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Marco Reus</a> apologized to angry fans and blasted what he called a “shameful” first-half performance from his side on Friday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Reus</a> scored in injury time to salvage a 3-3 draw against last-placed Paderborn, but it wasn’t enough to stop irate supporters raging against the players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dortmund/">Dortmund</a> was three goals down and heading for a second consecutive defeat following its 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich before the international break, before Jadon Sancho scored one and set up <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Reus</a>’ equalizer after Axel Witsel scored.</p>
      <p>“I have no explanation for the first half. No idea what we did there. It was shameful. We must never, ever play like that again,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Reus</a> told broadcaster DAZN.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dortmund/">Dortmund</a>, which started the season with Bundesliga title ambitions, looked far from capable of sustaining a challenge after dropping points for the seventh time in 12 games.</p>

      <p>Coach Lucien Favre is coming under increasing pressure, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Reus</a> defended the Swiss tactician and laid all the blame on his teammates.</p>
      <p>“We have to speak about it, there’s no other way,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Reus</a> said. “We didn’t just escape with a blue eye – we were really socked. The coach sets us up super. We’re the ones responsible for delivering our performance.”</p>
      <p>Streli Mamba stunned the home supporters with Paderborn’s opener in the fifth minute, finishing off a counterattack that began with a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dortmund/">Dortmund</a> corner. Kai Pröger outpaced Germany defender Nico Schulz on the right and crossed for Mamba’s simple finish.</p>
      <p>Mamba grabbed his second goal on another counterattack in the 37th, prompting a chorus of whistles from the home fans, and it got even worse from a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dortmund/">Dortmund</a> point of view when Gerrit Holtmann fired through Roman Bürki’s legs to make it 3-0 in the 43rd.</p>

        <p>Paco Alcácer hobbled off before halftime, adding to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dortmund/">Dortmund</a>’s woes. Lucien Favre, who already sent on Julian Brandt for the injured Alcácer, reacted with two changes at the break, sending on Thorgan Hazard and Achraf Hakimi for the off-color Schulz and Mahmoud Dahoud.</p>
        <p>Sancho pulled one back in the 47th, with Hakimi and Brandt both involved in the buildup.</p>
        <p>But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dortmund/">Dortmund</a> was looking increasingly desperate and Mamba came close to completing a hat trick before Witsel finally scored the next goal in the 84th.</p>
        <p>Sancho profited from a poor clearance to set up <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-reus/">Reus</a> in the 92nd.</p>
