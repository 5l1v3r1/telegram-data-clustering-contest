        <b>One after the other, more interested parties for Erling Haaland follow one another. At the moment, the player's father has gone to Arsenal to visit their facilities.</b>
      </p>
      <p>One more to choose from. A very busy summer awaits <b>Salzburg</b> striker,<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-haland-326208/"> Erling Haaland</a>. With the possibility of staying at the Austrian team practically ruled out, the player <b>will now have to choose which is the best option for him.</b></p>
      <p>The footballer's father does not want his son to rush and to make a decision lightly and that's why he is being <b>a key figure in the professional development</b> of the Norweigan footballer.</p>

      <p>Without going any further, his father, on learning of the interest shown in the Premier League for Haaland, <b>has been to visit <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal</a>'s facilities</b> to assess a possible transfer to the 'Gunners' club.Â </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the father of the striker has recommended that his son choose a <b>Bundesliga </b>team, with <b>RB Leipzig having the best chance </b>of taking the player with them.</p>
