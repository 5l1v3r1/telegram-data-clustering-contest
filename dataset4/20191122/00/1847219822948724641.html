        <b>Riga City Council, with its decision to announce the tender for waste management in the current redaction opposite to its previously given promise, demonstrates an open lobby for active waste management service providers in the city. Such behaviour opposes what was discussed in the committee. This is why this topic will be discussed again, says the chairman of Saeima’s National Economy Committee Jānis Vitenbergs.</b>

      <p>«Mr Burovs had a wonderful opportunity to put to rest concerns about lobbying Tīrīga and chase away the spirit of suspicions from the city by cancelling the planned monopoly tender. Based on existing tender requirements it becomes clear the city council is actively continuing creating beneficial conditions for existing service providers, which means it is unlikely other potential contenders, including foreign ones, will be able to participate in the tender for waste management services in Riga,» says Jānis Vitenbergs.</p>
      <p>The head of the National Economy Committee believes Riga City Council has not learned anything from the Competition Council’s decision – instead the city council has decided to arm itself with legal consultants to lobby the same waste management model in a different redaction. The head of the committee does not support extending the state of emergency to after 11 December, because the city council did not act responsibly – no pre-conditions were created to accommodate bigger competition, which is something the Competition Council had hoped for.</p>

      <p>Currently the National Economy Committee is viewing amendments prepared by Environment Protection and Regional Development Ministry to the Law on Waste Management, which provide for Riga City Council dividing waste management into several areas. The committee intends to follow the situation in Riga very carefully to prevent repetition in the future and ensure waste management system is open to competition.</p>
      <h3>«We in the committee will consider the best waste management model in Riga by involving residents in discussions. One of the topics up for discussion is the number of areas in the city council.»</h3>
      <p>«It is possible the number of areas could be increased to four so that other waste management service providers are able to participate, not just the ones who already provide services. We will also review Competition Council’s proposals on free competition market model,» says Vitenbergs.</p>
      <p>The committee’s head agrees with Environment Ministry in regards to Riga City Council’s binding requirements in regards to non-approval of waste management in the capital city, which prohibits the city council from announcing a new tender. The conditions in place have to be developed in the interest of Riga’s residents. There is no place to pick the easy way out and leave everything as is.</p>
