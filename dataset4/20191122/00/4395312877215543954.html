          <i>In reality, what is life all about?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The hummingbird searching desperately for sugar water when snowfalls; the crow or wise raven waiting for the opportune time to strike.</p>
      <p>The greatest philosophers and minds have pondered this question, books have been written, theories posed, spiritualism may provide the answers, yet no one is really clear about this life. It is creation, thereby it involves beginnings and endings, but all that happens in between these two signposts is both detrimental and ephemeral at the same time.</p>
      <p>Stepping back from everything allows one to witness the construction of the human since the day that we are born. The layers that we acquire as our identities are shaped, moving from one expression to the next, one fad to the next, ongoing and changing, and often revolving ourselves.</p>

      <p>The accumulation of knowledge in our lives is not a needless task; it is necessary for our unfolding.</p>
      <p>In the universal equation, our lives become pragmatic because of action, and action is required for life to happen. Knowledge is continuously confronted by itself, research contradicts its own findings, the truth becomes apparent to those who have experienced awakenings and major shifts in the lives. Therefore the accumulation of knowledge is necessary, yet, we must ask ourselves, how much do we really know?</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Knowing something intellectually, and knowing from the heart are typically exclusive~ one being called ‘book’ knowledge while the other “street knowledge”. But, what about knowing what is stored from the ‘great intellect of the heart?’</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This type of knowledge, according to the <a href="https://www.heartmath.org/articles-of-the-heart/science-of-the-heart/the-energetic-heart-is-unfolding/">HeartMath Institue</a> ‘like the brain, generates a powerful electromagnetic field’, McCraty explains in <i>The Energetic Heart, “The heart generates the largest electromagnetic field in the body. The electrical field as measured in an electrocardiogram (ECG) is about 60 times greater in amplitude than the brain waves recorded in an electroencephalogram (EEG).”</i></p>

      <p>This study and more reveal the truth about the heart — it is not only an organ that keeps us alive. It may be that organ that is keeping us organically alive, but what about ‘heart and brain communication’? <i>What does this mean for us?</i></p>
      <p>If the heart produced an EEG of approximately 60% of an EEG of the brain, is astute of us go within and begin to understand the science and electron communication<b><i>-the science of the heart</i></b>; because who knows; our heart may be the best predictor of the science underlying the human system.</p>
