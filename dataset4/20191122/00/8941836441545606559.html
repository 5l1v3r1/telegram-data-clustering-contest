      <p>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A Florida woman has been convicted of fraudulently obtaining Hurricane Irma disaster relief money.</p>
      <p>Court records show that 37-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/karen-latrice-houston/">Karen Latrice Houston</a> was convicted by a jury in Tampa federal court this week of three counts of theft of government funds. She faces up to 10 years in prison for each count.</p>
      <p>Investigators say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/karen-latrice-houston/">Houston</a> filed a false application with the Federal Emergency Management Agency in September 2017, days after Hurricane Irma hit Florida, to obtain disaster relief benefits. She falsely claimed that a Lakeland mobile home where she lived was damaged in the storm, but she had actually been evicted from the mobile home park earlier that year.</p>
      <p>The fraudulent application led to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/karen-latrice-houston/">Houston</a> receiving $21,875.57 in FEMA funds.</p>
