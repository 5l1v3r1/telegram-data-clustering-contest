      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:21:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:21</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A video of an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/instagram">Instagram </a>prankster scaring people on the streets of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">London </a>with a T. rex costume has gone <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/viral">viral</a>.</p>
      <p>The compilation video, posted by London-based social media personality <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DxmE2p133/">Goubtube</a>, shows pedestrians agog as they're confronted by the faux dino.</p>
      <p>The clip starts with a man in a cap dashing around a street corner as he’s being chased by the fake dinosaur. When bystanders see what the man is running from, they quickly make a run for it, too.</p>
      <p>One man even falls flat on his face.</p>

      <p>“Imagine trying to explain to your employer that your late because you got chased by a dinosaur, they’ll send you home,” one Twitter user commented.</p>
      <p>“Life comes at you fast,” another person wrote.</p>

      <p>Goubtube said he decided to prank the public with the T. rex because “I fancied having some harmless fun with the public,” according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7709727/Joker-T-Rex-costume-sparks-panic-street-terrified-pedestrians-fall-over.html">MailOnline</a>.</p>
