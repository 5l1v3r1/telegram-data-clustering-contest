      <p>Gospel musicians, Steve Crown, Erujeje, Chris Shalom have been listed to headline this year’s Just Worship musical concert which holds today at Shepherd Hill Baptist Church, Obanikoro, Lagos.</p>
      <p>According to the Visionary/Lead Worshiper of the event, Rev. Dr. Israel Kristilere, the musical concert which is in its 8th edition is not just a concert but a spiritual exercise.</p>

      <p>“I must state that this is not a concert and the goal is not to have a spectacular musical display in spite  of the invitation of gifted and well-known artistes,” said Rev Kristilere.</p>
      <p>Other artistes expected at the event include Bunmi Akionola, Indian Christian Congregation, Praise and Joy, Sax Angel, Demilade Adepegba, Crusaders, Baptist Mission School Choir, Shepherd’s Voice International, Heritage Kristilere among many others.</p>
