        <b>Diego Pablo Simeone made it clear: Atletico Madrid will not sign in January. Diego Costa's injury is a problem, but there is not need to look away from the squad they have. Men such as Saponjic, Dario Povedo and Riquelme could be the solution.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Simeone spoke before the game against Granada. He was asked<b> if Joao Felix would replace Diego Costa</b> and his answer was blunt. "He is not the main striker.<b> We also have Dario Poveda</b>, who has come in from Atletico B after having a few good games. <b>Saponjic is also available</b>, We have already spoken with him about what we need from him in the team.<b> We have Riquelme</b>, who also gives the possibility of being another forward," he analysed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/d-costa-28178/">Diego Costa</a> suffered a neck injury. "I am in contact with him.<b> It's calm, it went well, thank God.</b> I hope he comes back in the best way, with all the time he needs to get better. First as a person, then as a player," he said.</p>
      <p>And, already looking to the long term<b>, he made it clear that he has people in the squad to take over Costa's role.</b> "I think about it realistically. We have Morata, Dario, Saponjic... Costa is injured.<b> We trust that Dario Poveda will use this stretch to grow.</b> He is young, 20-years-old, tall and has good aerial play," he highlighted.</p>
      <p>Although, he did not close the door fully on<b> possible signings: </b>"You always have to be open to everything. <b>Perhaps someone wants to leave or another wants to come..."</b></p>

      <p>He took advantage of this to ask for the less frequently used players to take a step forward. "There's Saul and Thomas outside. <b>We'll give way to Llorente and Herrera</b> to hold the team. Marcos isn't getting a chance to play because I think others are doing well in midfield. He worked well in these 15 days, he will play a match as a result of that work," he continued.</p>
      <p>Simeone doesn't care about the amount of casualties: he promises to face Granada. "We work as a result of the match.<b> We're not looking for excuses, we represent Atletico</b> and we want to be a team. We're going to try to take the game where we feel comfortable, I'm not moved by anything else at the moment," he concluded.</p>
