      <h1>Tesla unveils its electric Cybertruck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Tesla has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/21/tesla-unveils-its-cybertruck/"><b>unveiled</b></a> its latest motor vehicle – the electric Cybertruck – at an event in California.</p>
      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk showcased the futuristic-looking truck, claiming that it can accelerate from 0-60mph in 2.9 seconds, which he showcased by playing a video of the Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 off the line.</p>
      <p>Musk also highlighted the strength of the vehicle by showing that it can withstand extreme force – including hits from a hammer, ball bearings, and a bullet.</p>
      <p>He also claimed that it can tow 6,350kg, and played a video showing it beating the Ford F-150 in a tug-of-war battle.</p>
      <p>Musk said that there would be three battery variations available which will offer 250+, 300+, and 500+ miles per charge respectively.</p>
      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck has one of the strangest designs of any modern vehicle, with flat, angular panels comprising most of the bodywork.</p>
      <p>The starting price for the Tesla Cybertruck is $39,900, and Tesla is accepting pre-orders for this baseline version of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Production is set to begin late in 2021, with the high-end versions scheduled to start production in 2022.</p>
      <h3>Tesla 4-wheeler</h3>
      <p>Tesla also unveiled an electric four-wheeler alongside the Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>It is not currently available for pre-order, and was primarily used to show how the Cybertruck’s suspension makes loading things into it incredibly easy.</p>
      <p>This vehicle can also charge while stored in the back of the Cybertruck.</p>
