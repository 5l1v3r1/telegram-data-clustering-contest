      <p>We're so glad to see this <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/sony/xperia-1/review-0">five-star phone</a> on sale! It's 4K HDR OLED display at 21:9 aspect ratio makes it perfect for on-the-go binge watchers, and the camera on the back is a great shooter for everyone. Plus now, you can save a whopping 200 quid for Black Friday.</p>

      <p>Even at its original price of £200 the Honor 9 Lite was considered one of the smartphone steals of 2018, so at £80 less it would be absolutely criminal not to take advantage if you’re in the market for an entry level smartphone. Not that the 9 Lite looks cheap, with its glass back and aluminium sides, 18:9 Full HD screen and dual camera setup. The processor’s a bit underpowered and battery life isn’t the best, but at this price those are compromises worth making.</p>

      <p>Not many manufacturers cater for those who don’t want a whopper of a screen these days, so Sony’s 5in Xperia XZ2 Compact is a bit of an anomaly in the smartphone world. While the build quality doesn’t match its bigger brethren and it’s a touch on the chunky side, there’s plenty of power inside, plus this particular deal also comes with a free pair of Sony’s excellent WF-1000X true wireless earphones, which makes it even more of a bargain.</p>

      <p>Honor's tech-packed 20 Pro is an absolute beast - and at this price it’s even more tempting. It’s also far from a one-trick pony, with a shapely design, gorgeous 6.3in edge-to-edge screen, supercharged AI-assisted internals, an impressive battery life and that belter of a 48MP camera. If the circa £1000 asking prices of 2018’s latest flagships has put you off but you don’t want to compromise on specs, you can do a lot worse than a P20 Pro.</p>

      <p>As you may have seen <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/apple/iphone-11-pro/review">in our review</a>, we absolutely love the iPhone 11 Pro.

      <p>It seems like Huawei has come from out of nowhere over the past few years, quickly becoming one of the stand out brands for gadget nerds everywhere! The P30 Pro brings plenty of power to the table, all crammed into that bonkers pearlescent body that really stands out. The camera array produces some stunning shots and the beasty 4,200 mAh battery keeps things running all day.</p>

      <h4>Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (100GB data + zero upfront cost)</h4>
      <p>Big, brilliant and just dripping with top tech. Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus is still one of the best top-end phones of this year, from that gorgeous OLED display to that photography powerhouse of cameras on the back. And, a 1-up on Apple is the price - you can get pro specs it for less than a grand.</p>
      <p>And, it's one of a rare pack of phones that still sports a headphone jack, giving your earphone freedom!</p>
