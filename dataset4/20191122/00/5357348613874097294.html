        <b>ST JOHN'S, Antigua (CMC) – A 36-year-old Jamaican man has been held on multiple drug charges following a drug operation carried out here earlier this month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The police report that Damien George Wilson was remanded to Her Majesty's Prison on Tuesday after being found in possession of 10 pounds of cannabis.</p>
      <p>Police from the narcotics division say they found “compressed furs” hidden inside a bedroom when they searched premises occupied by Wilson.</p>
      <p>The substance was seized and Wilson was later charged with possession of cannabis, possession with intent to transfer and being concerned in the supplying of cannabis.</p>
      <p>According to the police, this is not the first time that Wilson has gotten in trouble with the law.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he was classified as persona non grata by the state, and a deportation order was then made, listing him as an “undesirable resident”. However that order was challenged by his attorney and has reportedly not gone through the court process.</p>
      <p>When Wilson appeared in court earlier this week, he was remanded to prison until Tuesday, November 26.</p>
