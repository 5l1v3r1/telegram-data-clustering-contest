      <h1>What FNB’s former CEO thinks about its cryptocurrency crackdown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>Former FNB CEO and Montegray Capital founder Michael Jordaan has weighed in on FNB’s decision to terminate its banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges and related entities.</p>
      <p>While the bank’s decision affects exchanges and other intermediaries, it should not affect everyday FNB customers, even if they have purchased and sold cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Local exchanges told MyBroadband that FNB would shut down their business banking accounts next year, but the consumer experience would not be affected.</p>
      <p>Jordaan has a simple response to the notification that FNB will be closing cryptocurrency exchanges’ bank accounts – they will simply use other banks.</p>
      <h3>Get off zero</h3>
      <p>Jordaan said to his knowledge, FNB’s decision wasn’t due to pressure from local regulators, but it was a unilateral choice by the bank.</p>
      <p>“As far as I can tell, this closure of customer accounts held by crypto players is a unilateral decision by FNB and not as a result of pressure being brought to bear by regulators on all SA banks,” Jordaan said.</p>
      <p>“It is therefore positive that we have a competitive banking system where banks as well as customers can exercise choices about who they want as banking customers or where they want to bank.”</p>
      <p>Jordaan said he supports two South African-based cryptocurrency initiatives – VALR and DCX. He said that both these entities previously banked with FNB, but are now simply moving to Standard Bank.</p>
      <p>“I’m not involved in any fintech that will use blockchain to compete with banks in the payments space,” Jordaan said. “I understand that banks may see blockchain as a threat to their payments franchise, but I think this is remote.”</p>
      <p>“Bank Zero, for example, has chosen to embrace the sophistication of our local National Payments System to bring fee relief to consumers.”</p>
      <p>Jordaan described himself as a “crypto bull”, but added that the industry has attracted some shady players and urged customers to exercise caution when investing in cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>“But don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater by avoiding the entire crypto phenomenon,” he said. “Get off zero!”</p>
      <h3>Exchange operations</h3>
      <p>Luno has <a href="https://www.luno.com/blog/en/post/statement-on-proposed-fnb-bank-account-closure"><b>published</b></a> an updated statement on its website, stating that it will use its Standard Bank account for all deposits from FNB customers going forward.</p>
      <p>“We can confirm that Luno, along with other similar businesses, is affected by this decision,” the exchange said. “This means that FNB may be closing our business bank account in the second quarter of 2020.”</p>
      <p>“We do not anticipate any impact to our existing or future customers, as we have other banking relationships in place to support deposit and withdrawals on the platform.”</p>
      <p>“Customers with FNB accounts will be able to deposit into Luno’s fully integrated Standard Bank account,” Luno said.</p>
      <p>VALR co-founder Farzam Ehsani said the exchange’s FNB banking facilities remain operational and it is in discussions with FNB regarding the exact date of termination.</p>
      <p>“We will communicate this date to our customers in advance to ensure a seamless transition to our other banking partners, some of whom are already enabled on the VALR platform,” Ehsani said.</p>
      <p>Ehsani told VALR customers who bank with FNB that they might have to wait longer for their deposits to reflect in VALR’s system in future, as the exchange would no longer have an FNB account to receive deposits from FNB customers.</p>
