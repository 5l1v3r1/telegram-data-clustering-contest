      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/russell-westbrook">Russell Westbrook</a>‘s partnership with <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/james-harden">James Harden</a> in Houston has been a success, which did not come as a surprise to <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/paul-george">Paul George</a>.</p>
      <p>George, who played alongside Westbrook in OKC for two seasons before ultimately requesting a trade, says “Russ is a heckuva teammate.”</p>

      <p>PG adds that he spoke to Westbrook first about his desire to relocate to L.A. last summer.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28140424/paul-george-knew-russell-westbrook-james-harden-pairing-rockets-work">ESPN</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I knew it was going to work,” George said at the morning shootaround before the Clippers face the Rockets on Friday night. “Russ is a winner. Russ wants to win, Russ does whatever it takes to win. My time playing with him, Russ doesn’t really have an ego. He puts his ego to the side.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“He allowed me to be myself, he allowed me to be comfortable. And I had one of the best career [years] I had while playing alongside him. Russ is a heckuva teammate.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Playing alongside Westbrook, George finished third in MVP voting last season, averaging career-highs of 28 points and 8.2 rebounds to go with a career-high-tying 4.1 assists per game.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I made sure that was the first thing that I did was talk to Russ and get his temperature and see what he was looking [for] and see where he was at with things,” George told ESPN in October during Clippers training camp. “The relationship [with Westbrook] never stopped. The relationship never was a part of the reason why I left. Me and Russ got along great. I enjoyed [it]. I learned so much from playing alongside Russ. He made me a better player and person.”</i>
