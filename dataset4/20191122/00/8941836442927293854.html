      <p>ROXANA, Ill. (AP) - Relatives say a mother and her 7-year-old son had been returning from an autism therapy session when their minivan ended up in a suburban St. Louis retention pond.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis-post-dispatch/">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> reports that autopsies completed Thursday indicated that 34-year-old Ashly Maynard, and her son, Vincent Maynard, drowned. But a final cause of death won’t be decided until toxicology tests are completed.</p>
      <p>The bodies were found early Wednesday after a motorist spotted headlights in the water near Roxana, Illinois.</p>
      <p>The boy’s paternal grandmother, Mary Maynard of East Alton, described her nonverbal grandson as a “gift from God” and his mother as a forward-thinker.</p>
      <p>Madison County Sheriff John Lakin has said that although there were no skid marks at the scene, there is no indication so far that what happened was intentional.</p>
