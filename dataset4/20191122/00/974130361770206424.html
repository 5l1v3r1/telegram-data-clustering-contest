      <h1>Where To Watch Munster Vs Racing? TV Details For Zebo &amp; Ryan Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Connaughton</a></address>
      <p>After a hugely successful opening weekend for the Irish provinces, the four teams are back in action once again over the coming days. The biggest game of the round comes from Thomond Park, and we have all the tv details on where to watch Munster vs Racing.</p>
      <h3>Where to watch Munster vs Racing? </h3>
      <p>The game takes place in Thomond Park at 5.30pm on Saturday evening. It will be broadcast live on <b>BT Sport 3</b>, with coverage getting underway at 5.15pm. It will be directly preceded by Leinster's clash at Lyon.</p>
      <h3>Munster team news?</h3>
      <p>Munster have made three changes to the team that defeated Ospreys last week, with JJ Hanrahan, Tadhg Beirne and Jack O’Donoghue coming into the side. Tyler Bleyendaal is ruled out due to stiffness.</p>
      <p><b>Munster Team</b>: Mike Haley; Andrew Conway, Chris Farrell, Rory Scannell, Keith Earls; JJ Hanrahan, Conor Murray; Jeremy Loughman, Niall Scannell, John Ryan; Jean Kleyn, Tadhg Beirne; Peter O’Mahony (C), Jack O’Donoghue, CJ Stander.</p>
      <p><b>Replacements</b>: Kevin O’Byrne, James Cronin, Stephen Archer, Billy Holland, Fineen Wycherley, Alby Mathewson, Dan Goggin, Arno Botha.</p>
      <h3>Racing team news?</h3>

      <p><b>Racing Team:</b> Simon Zebo; Teddy Thomas, Virimi Vakatawa, Henry Chavancy, Juan Imhoff; Finn Russell, Maxime Machenaud; Eddy Ben Arous, Camille Chat, Cedate Gomes Sa: Donnacha Ryan, Dominic Bird; Wenceslas Lauret, Boris Palu, Antonie Claassen.</p>
      <p><b>Replacements: </b>Teddy Baubigny, Hassane Kolingar, Ali Oz, Fabien Sanconnie, Yoan Tanga Mangene, Teddy Iribaren, Ben Volavola, Brice Dulin.</p>
      <h3>What's on the line? </h3>
      <p>Both side secured comfortable wins in their opening pool games. Munster secured a bonus point win against Ospreys in Swansea, while Racing has 30-10 home win over a depleted Saracens side.</p>
      <p>Considering the trouble both Ospreys and Saracens find themselves in at the minute, whoever wins this game will no doubt take the initiative in the pool.</p>
      <p>This game will also see the return of Simon Zebo and Donnacha Ryan to Limerick, the two former Munster men who now ply their trade in France. They will no doubt receive a warm reception from the Thomond Park crowd, but that will be the end of the pleasantries.</p>
