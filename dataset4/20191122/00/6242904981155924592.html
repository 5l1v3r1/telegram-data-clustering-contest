      </p>
      <p>Ghana's U-23 team must beat South Africa in the third place play off game to grab the final slot for the continent in next year Olympics.</p>
      <p>“Based on our performance in this competition, I believe we deserve to go to Tokyo ( Olympic Games) but we have to really fight for it tomorrow and am sure that the boys will be up to the task," he said in a pre match conference.</p>
      <p>“It’s our last game in the tournament and it’s also a game that can qualify us to the Olympics so we will put in our best efforts to secure the ticket.</p>
      <p>“We know it won’t be easy because both teams have been good in the tournament”, he added. </p>
      <p>The Black Meteors suffered a disappointing penalty shootout defeat to Ivory on Tuesday to push their wait for a return to the Olympics to Friday.</p>
      <p>After 120 minutes of pulsating football against the Ivorian, Tanko says the players have been psyched for the final game of the competition.</p>
      <p>“Since Tuesday’s game we’ve worked hard on preparing and psyching them to play 100 % and secure the ticket to the Olympic Games on Friday," he said.</p>
