      <p>Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday (Nov 20) while dismissing rumors of meeting with target killer Yousuf ‘Thaliay Wala’, who is accused of ninety six murders, Murad has ordered Inspector General (IG) and Additional IG Sindh to launch an investigation into the case.</p>
      <p>CM’s remarks came a day after <a href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/374644/mqm-chief-case-uk-police-team-awaits-sindh-cops-to-record-statements/">Muttahida Qaumi Movemen</a>t (MQM) leader Farooq Sattar was also accused of being associated with the same man. “Neither do I have links with the accused, nor have I ever met him,” said the chief minister while speaking to media. “In 2017 Yousuf was in custody of Pakistan Rangers not the Police.” “I have instructed the police to launch an inquiry into the matter. I have gotten to the bottom of the matter myself,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Sindh CM also said that the police have been ordered to take action against the vehicle bearing wrong number plate and an FIR against the vehicle has also been registered which has been found to be of the Governor House.</p>
      <p>MQM leader Farooq Sattar on Wednesday (Nov 19)  also refuted allegations against him by the accused. “We do not have any ties with each other neither do I know the accused,” he said. Yousuf ‘Thailay Wala’ in his testimony had said Farooq Sattar provided him with shelter for a month while he was on the run.</p>
      <p>Yousuf Thailay Wala – arrested in murder of 96 people – made startling revelations during the investigation. Yousaf alias Thelay Wala claims to have been in contact with former MQM leader Dr Farooq Sattar. He made this and other startling revelations to the police during interrogation.</p>
      <p>Assassin alleged that he was in contact with Farooq Sattar and used to meet him at Nine Zero. “I used to kill people on the Muttahida Qaumi Movement orders of the party’s leadership,” he claimed.</p>
