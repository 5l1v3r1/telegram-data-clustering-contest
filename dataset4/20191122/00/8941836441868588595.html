      <p>KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) - The Hawaii County Council has become the first local government in the state to ban the use of herbicides on public property, officials said.</p>
      <p>The council passed a bill Wednesday to ban the use of 30 herbicides over four years, West Hawaii Today reported.</p>
      <p>The ban covers parks and areas alongside roads, bikeways, sidewalks, trails, drainage, and waterways owned or maintained by the county, officials said.</p>
      <p>The bill does not apply to private property or to residents who maintain land adjacent to county easements or lease agricultural land from the county, officials said.</p>
      <p>Scientific studies show links between herbicides and cancer, decreased cognitive function and behavioral problems in children, as well as damage to marine environments, supporters said.</p>

      <p>“Cigarettes used to be safe. Climate change used to be fake,” Puna Councilman Matt Kanealii-Kleinfelder said. “A lot of things we thought were safe, we’ve found would kill us.”</p>
      <p>Opponents believe the county’s bill is too expansive and could lead to a larger ban.</p>
      <p>Councilman Tim Richards voted against the measure, which he called “too over-arching, too far-reaching.” Three of the banned chemicals target weeds in soybeans and corn, which the county does not grow, he said.</p>
      <p>“The last thing we need to do is put anything in the way of agriculture to prevent it growing forward,” Richards said. “I completely support the intent, but I do not support the way this bill is written.”</p>

        <p>Parks and Recreation Director Roxcie Waltjen estimated the department would need 400 additional park maintenance workers to implement the measure, at a cost of about $39,000 per worker. Public Works Director David Yamamoto will also need more staff and equipment, but he did not have an estimate.</p>
        <p>Both departments have already cut their herbicide use by half, they said.</p>
