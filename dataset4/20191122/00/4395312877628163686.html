      <p>Starting a business is an exciting and fun decision that, although rewarding, can lead to many high-stress situations. When you are a business founder, there is an endless supply of tasks and choices to complete and make to keep your business afloat. Whether you are a solo founder or have other co-founders to work with, there are many things you can do to reduce the amount of stress you have daily. The less stress you have, the better off you are to achieve success. Here are tips to help you manage the stress as a business founder. </p>
      <p>Take A Look at Your Schedule</p>
      <p>When you are super busy, it can be challenging to take time and check in on yourself. Entrepreneurs are hard-working people who are dedicated to making their business thrive. This dedication and passion can often lead to a person taking on more than they can. Founders should create a schedule that is realistic and also dedicates time for rest and recovery. For a daily calendar, founders should aim to schedule everything they can think of, including time with family and friends. You don’t need to keep a strict schedule down to the minute, but be sure that you know you have time for more than just work.  </p>
      <p>Figure out what time of day you are most productive and schedule your most important or time-consuming duties then. While you create your schedule, use this time to evaluate your workload and decide if there are any tasks that you can <a href="https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/how-to-manage-entrepreneurial-stress.html">delegate</a> to other employees. Also, be sure to add time to work on the unexpected things that can pop up. When you make the time for the things that you enjoy, you can have something to look forward to that can help you manage your stress. </p>
      <p>Make Time for Yourself</p>
      <p>After you have created a schedule that has set aside some time for yourself, find something that you enjoy doing. Find a hobby that you can do that doesn’t involve your work. Creating time for yourself where you do not have to think about business will help you to reduce the stress that you feel. Aside from your favorite hobbies, make sure that you are doing some regular exercise as it can help your mood. Founders can benefit from regularly scheduled<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/325557"> time away from work</a>. Ensure that you plan at least one weekend entirely off every few months. Turn off your work phone and don’t check in on your business for the weekend to ensure you have time to get some rest and return refreshed and motivated. </p>
      <p>All founders are going to deal with stress, just as all business owners do. However, you don’t need to face that stress constantly. Different people have different tactics when it comes to dealing with stress, but planning out your schedule and taking time for yourself are two ways to manage your stress as a founder.</p>
