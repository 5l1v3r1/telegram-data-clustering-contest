      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - A jury is returning for more deliberations in the trial of a man in the shotgun death of his wife in Windham, Maine.</p>
      <p>Jurors deliberated for several hours Wednesday and then all day on Thursday in the trial of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/noah-gaston/">Noah Gaston</a>. They were set to resume their deliberations Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The defense doesn’t dispute that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/noah-gaston/">Gaston</a> shot his wife but contends he thought she was an intruder. Prosecutors said he intended to kill Alicia Gaston, or at least acted recklessly.</p>
      <p>The jury is weighing whether to convict <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/noah-gaston/">Gaston</a> of manslaughter or murder, or neither.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/noah-gaston/">Gaston</a>, who did not testify during the trial, has been held at the Cumberland County Jail since his arrest in January 2016.</p>
