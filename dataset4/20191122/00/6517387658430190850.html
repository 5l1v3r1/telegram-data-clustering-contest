Westlife outsold the rest of the Top 20 combined to secure the top spot.</p>
      <p>Speaking to OfficialCharts.com/Ireland, Westlife said: “Everybody in Ireland, thank you so much for making our brand-new album Spectrum Number 1. It’s our 11<sup>th</sup> Number 1 album so thank you so much guys, it means an awful lot to us. We’ll see you next summer for loads of concerts – Pairc Ui Chaoimh, see you there!”</p>
      <p>Westlife’s 11 Number 1 albums are made up of nine studio albums and two greatest hits collections: Westlife (1999); Coast to Coast (2000); World of Our Own (2001); Unbreakable: The Greatest Hits Volume 1 (2002); Turnaround (2003); Face To Face (2005); The Love Album (2006); Back Home (2007); Gravity (2010); Greatest Hits (2011).</p>
