      <p>A homesick Semi Radradra is reportedly prepared to sacrifice up to $2 million playing rugby union in order to return to the NRL.</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph reports that the Fijian winger has told close friends he wants to return to NRL with South Sydney.</p>
      <p>If reports were to be believed, the South Sydney Rabbitohs could become a likely destination following the retirement of Sam Burgess due to a recurring shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>This however will depend on whether they will receive salary cap dispensation for the English starâ€™s contract which was worth around $1 million per season.</p>
      <p>Radradra has recently been linked with a move to the Rabbitohs while Canterbury expressed interest before he represented Fiji in the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>According to the Telegraph, a third party is acting between Radradra and NRL clubs with the former Kangaroos flyer happy to field offers around $500,000 per season.</p>
