      <h1>Zidane rejected Willian</h1>

        <b>Willian is on Barcelona's agenda... But reports had claimed he was also in the sights of Real Madrid. However, sources now claim Zinedine Zidane decided to reject the player, who had been offered in replacement of Gareth Bale, expected to make an exit soon. He thinks Willian does not fit into the squad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The striker has been a key player at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a><b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/chelsea-fc"> </a>for a few seasons now</b>. Although Barcelona reportedly <b>made an offer for the Brazilian in the past</b>, the English club declined and Willian stayed at Chelsea for another season. </p>
      <p>His <b>market value is high,</b> although at <b>31 years old</b>, the decline has begun. His contract runs until the end of the season, which means that, <b>unless a contract renovation is set up</b>, he could leave for free next summer. </p>

      </ul>
      <p>And that's where the two interested clubs - Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona - come into play. 'The Sun' claims that <b>Zidane first rejected the option of signing Willian</b> because he first wants to deal with Gareth Bale's situation. The Welshman is backed by his coach, but his frequent controversy and bad relationship with fans and teammates mean he will probably be leaving sooner than later. </p>
      <p>This would mean that Barcelona has a clear <b>competition-free path for acquiring Willian</b>. All that remains to be seen is whether they will wait for his contract to end or make an offer in the winter transfer market. </p>
