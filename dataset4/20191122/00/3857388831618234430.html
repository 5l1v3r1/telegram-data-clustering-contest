      <p>The UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said on Tuesday that warring parties need to be given a benefit of patience to complete the outstanding issues within the signed revitalized peace agreement.</p>
      <p>David Shearer, head of UNMISS, told journalists that both President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar need the 100 days to resolve the outstanding issues and that the international community and African Union should give them a benefit of patience.</p>
      <p>"If you look at all the things that they need to do with the demobilisation, who knows how many thousand people in their re-integration, will it happen in 100 days? We know that it's impossible it has never happened in any other country in the world but the start is there and if the momentum continues and the political will continues that's very possible that by the end of 100 days, we will have enough momentum that we can get forward," said Shearer during a press conference in Juba.</p>
      <p>He revealed that the parties need to make progress on the reunification of forces in order to earn trust and confidence. And the issue of states and boundaries requires negotiation and a political settlement.</p>
      <p>Shearer also urged the government to release the remaining money to fund the peace implementation process. So far $33 million have been disbursed by the government for peace implementation.</p>
      <p>The communique signed by both parties after the meeting in the Ugandan city of Entebbe in early November disclosed that they will review progress after 50 days (Jan.1) of the peace implementation process.</p>

      <p>"Everybody believes and thinks that after the 100 days, we might not have everything complete but what we are really looking for is to be in a position where things are moving forward sufficiently. Where everybody goes yes this is working," he said.</p>
      <p>"I have confidence that we can have a transitional government and we will continue to move forward and we will continue to unify the forces and do all other things," added Shearer.</p>
      <p>South Sudan descended into conflict in December 2013 after Kiir sacked his deputy Machar, leading to fighting between soldiers loyal to respective leaders.</p>
