      <p>Twitter has made a crucial change to its <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1197621020229804054?s=20">security settings</a> that allows you to use two-factor authentication (2FA) without supplying your phone number. This is an important change because it means that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2ftechnology%2f2019%2f02%2f07%2ftwitter-reveals-its-daily-active-user-numbers-first-time%2f%3f">Twitter’s 320 million users</a> are less vulnerable to attacks such as Sim swapping if they don’t have their phone number tied to the account.Sim swapping is a type of attack where the hacker uses your phone number and tricks your provider into activating your Sim card on another device. </p>
      <p>Because it potentially allows the attacker to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-prevent-and-respond-to-a-sim-swap-scam-1835627474">deactivate your device</a> and move everything over to their own, the impact can be devastating. One tech journalist at <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sim-swap-horror-story-ive-lost-decades-of-data-and-google-wont-lift-a-finger/">ZDNet</a> wrote an article about the huge effect a Sim swapping attack had on him.</p>
      <p>It’s certainly a scary thought, and something <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey</a> himself is familiar with, since his account was recently hijacked using this type of cyberattack.  </p>
      <p>In addition, the move by Twitter to remove the need for a phone number for 2FA improves your privacy. Twitter came under fire after it admitted it had “unintentionally” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/twitter-admits-it-used-two-factor-phone-numbers-and-emails-for-targeted-advertising/">used people’s phone numbers supplied for 2FA</a> for advertising purposes. </p>
      <p>It is widely agreed that SMS based authentication can still pose a risk, so what should you use instead?</p>
      <p>Ideally, you would use a security key such as Yubico’s YubiKey, which allows you to physically authenticate your account. They are a relatively new thing in the consumer world, but Apple recently added support for security keys in Safari, which is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/11/14/apple-ios-133-is-poised-to-launch-with-this-killer-security-feature/#5a12f17372e5">expected to launch in iOS 13.3</a>, so expect to see their use increase.</p>
      <p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/webauthn.html">Twitter added support for the FIDO2 WebAuthn protocol</a> allowing more people to use security keys in May this year. </p>
      <h3>Improving your Twitter 2FA: What to do</h3>
      <p>If you already have a phone number associated with your Twitter account, it’s easy to remove it in your settings. Go to your account and select to delete your phone number. If you are already using your number for 2FA, you will now need another method of authenticating your account. </p>
      <p>A security key is the best way to secure your account, but you’d need another method such as an app for now.<a href="https://twitter.com/jcmi/status/1197649884645511168?s=20">Twitter engineer Jared Miller</a> said: “Currently we require you to have a second method along with security keys since the latter isn’t currently supported outside web. If you’d like to disable SMS, you need to also have a mobile security app.”</p>
      <p>Security researcher Sean Wright recommends using a security key if you can, along with an app. He says SMS based authentication is “an absolute last resort.” </p>
      <p>Ethical hacker John Opdenakker agrees. “It's good to see that Twitter finally added the option to remove the phone number from your account. SMS based two-factor authentication is known to have serious security risks, like Sim swapping attacks or SS7 attacks in which SMS can be intercepted.”</p>
      <p>ESET security expert Jake Moore also congratulates Twitter for making the move. “Cyber criminals can intercept SMS in a variety of ways. Most recently we have seen an increase in Sim jacking which has been somewhat of a headache for service providers and tech firms alike.”</p>
      <p>He says using authenticator apps such as Google Authenticator or Authy can stop this intrusion and add “total security” when using 2FA. </p>
      <h3>Twitter 2FA: Using authenticator apps </h3>
      <p>Security keys are useful to have in general, but they are not yet widely supported. Therefore Opdenakker recommends authenticator apps as “a good middle ground between security and usability.”</p>
      <p>He says that previously, Twitter had “unnecessarily left people at risk” by making it impossible to delete your phone number. “If you're still using SMS based 2FA for your Twitter account, switch to a more secure option now, and remove your phone number.”</p>
      <p>When using an authenticator app, Opdenakker advises: “Make sure you have backup and recovery in the authenticator app to save you from a lot of trouble.”</p>
      <p>It’s a great move by Twitter, and hopefully it’s also helped to raise awareness of the importance of 2FA in general. So if you are not using an authenticator app yet, why not try a free one now? </p>
