      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - A protest over the policing of New York City’s subways briefly shut down a busy Harlem subway station during rush hour, and news stations say multiple people have been arrested in the fluid demonstration.</p>
      <p>News stations say hundreds of protesters converged Friday evening and marched on and near the major corridor of 125th Street.</p>
      <p>Police spokesmen said they didn’t immediately have arrest information.</p>
      <p>The New York Police Department tweeted around 7 p.m. that there were traffic and mass transit disruptions in the area.</p>
      <p>A half-hour earlier, New York City Transit tweeted that three subway lines bypassed their 125 Street station for a time, then resumed stopping while police barred entry to the station for a while afterward.</p>
