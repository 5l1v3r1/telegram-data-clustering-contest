      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday expressed concerns that enacting his administration's proposed ban on many flavored e-cigarette and vaping products would lead to people obtaining them illegally.</p>
      <p>Trump also raised worries during a raucous meeting with public health and industry representatives that illegal e-cigarette and vaping products could be substandard.</p>
      <p>"If you don't give it to them, it's going to come here illegally," Trump said.</p>
      <p>Seated next to U.S. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who wants children protected from flavored vaping products, Trump listened to the back-and-forth for nearly an hour, peppering each side with questions to try to determine the best way forward.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration said in September it would unveil a sweeping ban on most e-cigarette and vaping flavors seen as attracting young users to addictive nicotine products. But concerns about the potential loss of jobs has prompted him to revisit the issue.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration's announcement that it would take action comes amid public alarm over a mysterious U.S. vaping-related respiratory illness that has sickened more than 2,000 people and killed 47.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Trump, who is gearing up for a 2020 re-election race and trumpets the strength of the U.S. economy daily, was warned by an e-cigarette executive that a ban on the products could lead to a loss of at least 100,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>Harold Wimmer, the head of the American Lung Association, pushed for a ban on all e-cigarette and vaping flavors.</p>
      <p>"That's a big statement," Trump said.</p>
      <p>Wimmer told Trump that his stance was comparable to what Trump had announced in September.</p>
      <p>Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, accused the sector's critics of being funded by a billionaire politician and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>"That's obnoxious," someone replied.</p>
      <p>In September, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bloomberg's charity, announced it was launching a $160 million program aimed at ending youth e-cigarette use.</p>
      <p>"This is one of the most important causes of his life and he will never back down in the face of their criticisms,‚Äù Jean Weinberg, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg Philanthropies, said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>More than 27.5% of American high school students use e-cigarettes, up from 20.7% in 2018, according to a U.S. government study. Evidence has shown that youth exposure to nicotine affects brain development and makes them more susceptible to nicotine addiction in the future.</p>
      <p>"It's the flavors that are drawing the kids in. It's a health emergency ... We have to put the kids first," said Romney, adding that half of high school students in his state use vaping products.</p>
      <p>Romney, in a tweet later on Friday, said he would continue his own push for legislation to ban flavors, make vaping cartridges tamper-proof and bar e-cigarettes from schools.</p>
      <p>Trump reiterated on Friday that his administration was considering raising the age to buy such products to 21. But he indicated that no final decision had been made.</p>
      <p>"We'll let you know ... We want to take care of our kids," he said.</p>
