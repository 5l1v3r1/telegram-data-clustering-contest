      <h1>Zion Williamson On Pace For Mid-December Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/austinkent/" target="_blank">Austin Kent</a></address>
      <p>It’s been one month since the New Orleans Pelicans revealed that Zion Williamson would be sidelined for six-to-eight weeks while <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/zion-williamson-out-6-to-8-weeks-following-surgery/">recovering from knee surgery</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRenderNBA/status/1197748327682596865?s=20">TNT’s Reggie Miller</a> confirms that the big man’s recovery is right on track to get back on the court in mid-December.</p>
      <p>The No. 1 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft dominated preseason but was ruled out of the team’s final exhibition match and hasn’t seen regular season action at all.</p>
      <p>Miller’s revelation came shortly after he speculated that the first-year forward could potentially miss the entire 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>Miller, of course, was courtside commentating on a Pelicans game and could have been corrected by somebody within the organization after broadcasting his more pessimistic “gut feeling”.</p>
      <p>There have been no shortage of hot takes regarding Williamson’s injury, many of which center around the idea that he’s too heavy for his playing style. The team has <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/pelicans-gm-zion-williams-knee-injury-unrelated-to-weight/">emphatically denied</a> that his weight has anything to do with the injury.</p>
