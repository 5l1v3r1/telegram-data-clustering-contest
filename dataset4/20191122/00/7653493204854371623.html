      <h1>Parcel Pickup War: Amazon, Oz Post Set To Slug It Out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/computer-daily-news/" target="_blank">Computer Daily News</a></address>
      <p>Amazon and Australia Post are both looking to make inroads into the Australian market for online goods via establishment of new parcel pick-up services – either via newly installed sealed lockers across the country, or at networks of many hundreds of parcel pick-up points.</p>
      <p>Amazon this week has rolled out a network of hundreds of parcel pick-up points across NSW and Victoria, and pledges to have a nationwide system operating “soon”.</p>
      <p>Australia Post, which already delivers thousands of Amazon purchases, says it now has parcel lockers in more than 350 sites across Australia, and is adding to those via a partnership with fulfilment technology company Doddle.</p>
      <p>This sees customers able to pick up or return their online shopping at sites including 24/7 parcel lockers, pharmacies, supermarkets and department stores, as well as post offices.</p>
      <p>Says Doddle CEO Justin Dery: “Pick-up’ services are the fastest-growing delivery option globally, and with 35 percent of Australian consumers picking up an online order last year, the potential in this market is huge.”</p>
      <p>But the OzPost/Doddle effort now faces potentially very strong opposition from Amazon, which has opened its service in NSW and Victoria.</p>
      <p>The Amazon service involves two pick-up options: either through lockers or at selected “counters”. The lockers are initially available in Commonwealth Bank branches, Victorian news agencies and some Stockland shopping centres.</p>
      <p>But Amazon Oz says hundreds more locations will be “coming soon”.</p>
      <p>Those choosing a “locker” pick-up will receive an e-mail message that includes a unique barcode and a six-digit code. The buyer can go to the locker and either scan the barcode or enter the six-digit code – and retrieve the parcel.</p>
      <p>Amazon Australia has said it hopes to have thousands of Hub locations across the nation by 2020.</p>
