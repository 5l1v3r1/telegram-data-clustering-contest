      <h1>Myles Garrett Fires Back At NFL Over Not Finding Evidence of Racial Slur: ‘I Know What I Heard’ (TWEET)</h1>

      <p>Myles Garrett is not going down without a fight.</p>
      <p>The Cleveland Browns defensive end took to Twitter hours after the NFL stated they “found no such evidence” that Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph directed a racial slur at him during Thursday Night Football that led to a massive brawl.</p>

      <p>Garrett made the allegation during an appeal hearing with the NFL on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Mason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident Thursday night in Cleveland,” Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten said in a statement. “He will not discuss this accusation any further and his focus remains on preparation for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.”</p>
      <p>Rudolph told reporters on Wednesday that he did not say anything to provoke Garrett or escalate the situation.</p>
      <p>Rudolph’s attorney, Timothy M. Younger, said: “According to ESPN, in his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur toward him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason’s uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension. This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing, and conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett.</p>
      <p>“The malicious use of this wild and unfounded allegation is an assault on Mason’s integrity which is far worse than the physical assault witnessed on Thursday. This is reckless and shameful. We will have no further comment.”</p>
