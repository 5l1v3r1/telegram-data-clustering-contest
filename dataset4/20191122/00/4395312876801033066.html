      <h2>In 1963 I saw that our hero President Kennedy was killed. In 1968 Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were shot. When I went to Santa Clara, I took art and humanities classes and joined my friends in the streets protesting the Vietnam War and continued to do so until it was over. Studying with the Jesuits was the greatest joy. It was exhilarating. I looked up so many words that students asked me if I was a foreign student. I paid for my own models and I took every art class available. I talked one of my teachers into tutoring me in anatomy one in one and took my art to the gallery Where he had his work where they then included mine. Three years into school there, one of my teachers, Paul Kos told me about San Francisco Art Institute with a teacher named Sam Tchakalian. I transferred to my uncle’s disapproval. I attended 2 1/2 more years before I graduated with a BFA in 1978. It was a remarkable combination of training in skills and expression. I loved it all. I had been married and it was annulled... life went on. In 1978 I left Robert and moved to San Francisco. Two nights later I went to a light show party in San Francisco and there I met Harvey Johnson Warnke, III. We were married within a week of the completed annulment on New Years Eve 1978. In 1979, I became a commodity and stock broker, tge next year I got involved in realestate development in San Francisco and became part owner of a building in North Beach. Harvey was an inventor. He had two of the first computers on earth at the time. I raised money for his company. Before I was 30 in 1980, I had raised my first million dollars, all while creating art all the way along that path. I got up at 5, got dressed, picked up my espresso at Trieste and walked to Dean Witter, one of the first female brokers. Of course I handled funds from the Steve Miller Band and traded their silver commodity in a declining market. I made them money (because of my New York friend who was a professional commodity broker.). Of course I was hit in by a lecherous boss and had to quit my job.... so many stories... Overall, it was great training. As I worked at Dean Witter, I had exhibitions of my work. Harvey and I moved to Los Angeles in 1982. He built his company. He lost it. He got a job. All the things that entrepreneurs do when they are young. I had exhibitions of my art.</h2>
