      <p>Despite significant economic and political uncertainty, the U.K.’s high-growth technology businesses continue to prosper. By the end of this year, the sector is expected to have raised a record $11 billion in foreign investment and funding according to research from Tech Nation and Dealroom for the U.K. government’s Digital Economy Council. Here are just five of the most exciting U.K. technology companies set for big things in 2020. <b>WhiteHat</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://whitehat.org.uk/">WhiteHat</a> is on a mission to build an outstanding alternative to university through high quality apprenticeships. Founded by Euan Blair and Sophie Adelman in 2016, it aims to match motivated young people with roles in aspirational careers such as software engineering, digital marketing and data science at more than 250 of the world’s best employers. </p>
      <p>For employers, the lure is the opportunity to nurture and develop entry level employees as they seek to mould the next generation of talent. Diversity of talent is critical also to WhiteHat’s offering; so far, 65% of apprentices placed by the business have come from minority ethnic backgrounds. In July 2019, it secured $16 million in Series A funding from Index Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures. </p>

        <b>Koru Kids</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.korukids.co.uk/">Koru Kids</a>, a platform that finds and manages childcare, was founded by Rachel Carrell, who decided to quit her job to create better after-school care options in London. Launched in 2016, it works by matching parents with flexible, part-time nannies. Following the matching process, Koru Kids takes care of all the administration involved, ranging from contracts to payment for work. It also selectively picks and trains up and trains applicants to become nannies and accepts less than 6% of all applicants.</p>
      <p>Currently, nearly 1,000 of the company’s nannies provide care every day in London. More recently, Koru Kids raised $12 million in Series A investment to help the company scale further, with the investment led by Atomico. </p>
