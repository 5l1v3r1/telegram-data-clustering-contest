      <p>The Youth Patriotic Movement (YPM) has lauded the Nana Akufo-Addo-led New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration for policies related to youth development in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The movement noted that the current government has done a lot in that direction and deserves commendation.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Executive Strategic Officer of YPM, Mr Ishmael Osei Ofori, has called on the Ghanaian electorate to consider giving the President a second term, saying it would be prudent to support the second tenure of office for him.</p>
      <p>According to Osei Ofori, it would be prudent to support Nana Akufo-Addo with a second term mandate in the 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>He observed that a nod to keep the government in power would help it to stabilise the economy and continue to create employment avenues for the youth.</p>
      <p>The UPM leadership said Ghanaians, particularly parents and the youth in general, are reaping the full benefits of the free Senior High School (SHS) under the leadership of His Excellency Nana Akufo-Addo, while farmers who could not afford to buy fertilisers and other farm inputs are now also enjoying the benefits of the “Planting for Food and Jobs” project.</p>
      <p>The YPM head also mentioned that university graduates who were seriously frustrated to the extent of forming the Unemployed Graduates Association have now been absorbed into the Nation Builders Corps (NABCO) modules and receiving monthly stipends to support themselves and their families.</p>
      <p>These and many more social interventions go to explain how committed the President was in a bid to improve a lot of the average Ghanaian.</p>
      <p>“We applaud the gallant achievements of the government, and pray that it grows from strength to strength and adds to the list of feats for the benefit of Ghanaians in the ensuing years,” Mr Osei Ofori said in a statement.</p>
