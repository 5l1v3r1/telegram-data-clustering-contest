        <b>Melbourne City beat Western Sydney Wanderers in a lively game at Bankwest Stadium thanks to a couple of goals from Jamie Maclaren.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In-form striker <b>Jamie Maclaren scored in the 92nd minute</b> as Melbourne City snatched a 3-2 win at Western Sydney Wanderers to move four points clear at the A-League summit.</p>
      <p>City conceded four second-half goals to lose 4-3 at Brisbane Roar last weekend, but <b>they bounced back to edge a thrilling game</b> at Bankwest Stadium on Friday. Wanderers could have drawn level on points with their opponents with a victory and they were ahead inside 90 seconds, <b>Kwame Yeboah converting Bruce Kamau's first-time cross</b> - the goal allowed to stand following a VAR check for offside.</p>
      <p>Joshua Brillante and Daniel Georgievski came close to scoring for their respective sides in an open game, but <b>it was Maclaren who netted the game's next goal</b> from the penalty spot after Pirmin Schwegler pulled on Denis Genreau's shirt.</p>

      <p><b>The visitors completed the turnaround 17 minutes later </b>when Lachlan Wales squared the ball for Brillante to tap in,<b> only for Yeboah to hammer past Dean Bouzanis</b> to complete his brace after Alexander Meier unselfishly headed the ball into his path.</p>
      <p>Late drama followed, however, as <b>Maclaren was given time and space to turn inside the box</b> and rifle home late on to make it nine goals for the season.</p>
