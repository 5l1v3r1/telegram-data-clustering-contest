        <b>Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana made it clear in an interview with 'RMC Sport' that he thinks clubs "don't trust black goalkeepers". He argued that there are very few in Europe and that this is not just his perception, "you just have to look."</b>

      <p>Ajax goalkeeper Onana has added to the conversation with his controversial comments: "<b>Clubs do not have faith in black goalkeepers. That’s a reality. It is not me who is saying it.<b> </b>You just have to look<i>,</i></b>" said the Eredivisie player.</p>
