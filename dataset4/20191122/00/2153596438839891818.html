        <li><b>Towing</b> – Tesla said that the Cybbertruck has the ability to pull ‘near infinite mass’ and a towing capability of over 14,000 pounds;</li>
        <li><b>Adaptive</b> <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> – Raise and lower suspension four inches in either direction for easy access to Cybertruck or the vault, while self-levelling capabilities adapt to any occasion and assist with every job;</li>
