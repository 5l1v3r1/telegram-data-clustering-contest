      <p>Just as online brokers dropping trading fees en-masse precursed major merger talks, tee time providers first began jettisoning booking/convenience fees a couple years before major M&amp;A would tee off.Reports of Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) making a big swing and making a play to buy competitor TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ: AMTD) for $26 billion in order to create a mega broker with combined assets in the $5 trillion ballpark may make golf’s round broker tie-up news seem puny by comparison.  But in the world of online tee time reservation, the ramifications of consolidation are just as massive.</p>
      <p>NBC Sport Group has acquired EZLinks Golf, the parent company of TeeOff.com for an undisclosed amount. The merger means that tee time booking industry titans GolfNow and Teeoff.com are now under the same umbrella which stands to give golfers a one-stop option to shop deals and book rounds at upwards of 9000 courses around the globe.</p>
      <p>“Like GOLFNOW, EZLinks has been committed to maintaining an open platform for golf operators,” said Gary Cohen, chief executive officer of EZLinks Golf in a statement. “The combination of our two organizations will only enhance that shared commitment as we work more closely together to serve the needs of our clients and golfers everywhere.”</p>
      <p>The merger will “round out our comprehensive portfolio designed to help courses elevate the golf experience,” Jeff Foster, senior vice president, GolfNow and Emerging Businesses, said in a statement. “Simply put, our strategy is to make golf more accessible, simpler and more enjoyable to play by using tech and services that help better connect golfers and golf courses.”  </p>
      <p>“Teeoff and EZLinks Golf will round out our comprehensive portfolio designed to help courses elevate the golf experience at their venues and to better serve needs of the modern golfer,” added Foster.</p>

        <b>Years of Duking it Out</b>
      </p>
      <p>EZLinks and GolfNow were heated rivals jockeying for control of the tee time booking market.  EZLinks had rebuffed a previous buyout offer from GolfNow and in 2012 EZLinks dropped a lawsuit on their competitor alleging corporate malfeasance by hiring a former EZLinks employee to gain access to confidential trade secrets pertaining to their tee time reservation software. The companies eventually settled the suit. In 2015 the PGA Tour invested in TeeOff.com, rebranding the No. 2 player in the reservation space as TeeOff.com by PGA TOUR and began marketing the platform heavily.</p>
      <p>Golfers who book online or use either the GolfNow or TeeOff mobile app won’t notice any changes straight away, both services are still operate as independent silos for now.</p>
      <p>Will McIntosh, executive vice president of NBC Sports Digital &amp; Consumer Business, said in a release that the company plans to incorporate EZLinks' technology and services “into the comprehensive digital solutions we already offer,” to “enhance our ability to help golf courses operate more efficiently and make the game more accessible for golfers.”</p>
      <p>The latest National Golf Foundation report tabbed the number of golf rounds  played in 2018 at 434 million<b>.</b> While there’s not a definitive statistic on the percentage of those that were booked online, in 2016 EZLinks client data showed that 16% of tee times were reserved online, that’s up from 11% in in 2011. The merger stands to create a third-party tee time reservation goliath and with the entities marketing muscle tag teamed. the percentage of overall rounds booked on the combined platform could be turbocharged. Let’s just hope they resist a conjoined name a la Kraft-Heinz or SiriusXM as “GolfNowTeeOff” would be a mouthful.</p>
