      <p>Forget the farmers market. The Kroger Co. will soon offer even fresher produce options inside more than a dozen stores across the Northwest.Kroger, the largest grocery retailer in the country, is partnering with Berlin-based startup Infarm to install living farms inside its stores, the company announced this week. The initiative, which is the first of its kind in the United States, promises produce “so fresh, you can see the roots.”</p>
      <p>Kroger will launch the initiative month in Washington state – at two QFC groceries in Bellevue and Kirkland, outside Seattle. Kroger says the farms are planned at 15 stores overall. The company did not elaborate on the additional locations. Infarm, in a social media post announcing the collaboration, said it would grow items like herbs and leafy greens.</p>
      <p>Infarm has over 500 farms in stores and distribution centers around the world and has partnered with more than 25 major retailers in seven countries.</p>
      <blockquote>"Our partnership with Infarm allows us to innovate by combining ground-breaking in-store farming technology with our passion for fresh, local produce and ecological sourcing,” Suzy Monford, Kroger’s group vice president of fresh, said in a release. “We're proud to lead the U.S. on this journey."</blockquote>
      <p>Kroger in 2017 announced its “Zero Hunger | Zero Waste” social impact plan to end hunger in local communities and eliminate waste across the company by 2025. The company says 40% of the food produced in the United States is thrown away. An estimated 72 billion pounds ends up in a landfill every year. There’s also an environmental cost for shipping groceries all around the world.</p>
      <p>Living produce farms, which use hydroponic technology, remove the need for extended transportation and storage – which means for a more sustainable, eco-conscious product, Kroger said. The farms are designed to scale. InFarm, founded in 2013, says its systems use 95% less water, 75% less fertilizers and require 90% less transportation than industrial farming.</p>
      <p>InFarm, which bills itself as the world’s fastest-growing urban farming network, uses IoT technologies and machine learning, with patented technologies, to grow greens in controlled-environment cases. The cases are modular and can stack to fit any space, and Infarm can remotely monitor crops and troubleshoot in real time. Its produce offerings include basil, mint, kale, crystal lettuce, water cress and more, but no fruit, although Infarm said that is a possible offering in the future.</p>
      <p>"We want to make fresh, pure, tasty and nutritious produce available and affordable for everyone," Erez Galonska, CEO and co-founder at Infarm, said. "Kroger's commitment to innovation, quality and flavor makes them the perfect partner with which to launch our business in the United States and for the first time in North America."</p>
      <p>Kroger, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates nearly 2,800 stores in 35 states. It owns brands like QFC, Harris Teeter, Ralphs, Fry’s, Fred Meyer and more.</p>
