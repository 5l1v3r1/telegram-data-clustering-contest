      <h1>Donald Trump holds court over fiery White House debate on vaping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/tom-howell-jr/" target="_blank">Tom Howell Jr.</a></address>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> said Friday he wants to raise the legal purchasing age for e-cigarettes to 21 but worries an outright ban on some products would create a black market, weighing in as he hosted a fiery debate between advocates concerned about teen vaping and industry reps who say flavored products create jobs and help adult smokers quit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> is seeking to balance those interests as he wavers on a September pitch to ban all flavored e-cigarettes, except menthol and tobacco-flavored ones.</p>
      <p>Seated at a long table, the president said “we are going to be” raising the age threshold from 18 to 21, though said an outright ban on flavored e-cigs might drive sales underground.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t give it to them, it is going to come here illegally,” he said from the White House. “They could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible.”</p>
      <p>“They are going to have a flavor that is poison,” the president added.</p>

      <p>The administration is alarmed by an “epidemic” of e-cigarette use among teens. Seeing a new generation of Americans become addicted to nicotine is not an acceptable tradeoff for declining smoking rates among adults, officials have said, and mysterious deaths linked to vaping have added a sense of urgency.</p>
      <p>But conservatives and free-market groups want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> to back off a stated plan to wipe the e-cig market of special flavors.</p>
      <p>They say adults weaning off regular cigarettes rely on fruity flavors, and that a ban would put “mom and pop” vape shops out of business.</p>
      <p>“Adults like flavors. That’s precisely why everything from vodka to ice cream comes in a variety of flavors. When it comes to vaping, this holds true,” the groups told <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> in an October letter led by Americans for Tax Reform.</p>

        <p>Anti-vaping advocates, however, told <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> that straight-A students are flunking out of school because they’re addicted to nicotine. They want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> to stick to his guns and ban all flavors.</p>
        <p>From the White House, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said “most adults are not using flavors” and that a major company — JUUL — managed to voluntarily withdraw flavored products.</p>
        <p>Industry leaders at the table objected, saying they often sell flavored products to adults.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romney appeared unmoved, saying at one point: “Utah is a Mormon state, and half the kids in high school are vaping.”</p>
        <p>Democrats such as Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois has said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> will be putting millions of children at risk if he “flip flops” on his earlier bid to ban flavored e-cigs.</p>
        <p>The White House said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a>’s interest in the debate shouldn’t be viewed as a retreat.</p>
        <p>“As the president has said, there is a serious problem among our youth and their growing addiction to e-cigarettes. The policymaking process is not stalled – it continues to move forward,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Judd Deere said.</p>
        <p>He said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> wanted to hear from “all sides” of the issue “as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people.”</p>
        <p>Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who pushed for a crackdown on e-cigarettes, told CNBC on Friday that even if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> got “spooked” by pushback, there may be a path forward. Officials might be able to carve adult-only vape shops out of any ban while cracking down on products sold to youth at convenience and gas stores.</p>
        <p>“You don’t want to just sweep the market of everything,” he said. “You want to leave something for the adults.”</p>
