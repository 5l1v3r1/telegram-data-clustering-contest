      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanlookjr/2019/07/19/is-your-vacation-ruining-the-planet/#739c35c495db">Sustainable travel</a> may seem like just a buzzword to some, but the movement has caught serious momentum in the last few years. With concerns about the impact of travel ranging from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/10/21/the-worst-offenders-for-air-travel-emissions-infographic/#293b7cad30cd">airplane CO2 emissions</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/18/environmental-damage-of-tourism-comes-under-mps-spotlight">ecological damage</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnyjet/2018/08/20/how-is-overtourism-impacting-travel-to-popular-destinations/#4d4c9f8335b8">overtourism in small towns and cities</a>, more and more travelers are making conscious choices to minimize their travel footprints. That may include cutting down on air travel, exploring cities by bike instead of car or avoiding single-use items in favor of reusable alternatives. If you know someone who prioritizes both exploring new destinations <i>and</i> being as low-impact of a traveler as possible, consider one of the gifts below. Many of the companies below are certified <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-corps">B-Corps</a>, which means they’ve met very high standards for environmental and community sustainability. Here are some of the best gift ideas for sustainable travelers, starting at just $20.</p>

      <p>Having a durable bag that will hold up when smushed under an airplane seat or dropped on a motorbike ride is essential for active travelers. Fortunately, Patagonia’s Black Hole bags are just that. Waterproof, rip-proof and nearly indestructible, many of the bags fold up into their own pocket to save space, which carry-on-only travelers will appreciate. The fabric and webbing are made of 100% recycled materials; Patagonia estimates they used 10 million plastic bottles to make the 2019 collection. They come in a <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/shop/luggage-black-hole-bags?srule=price-low&amp;sz=12&amp;start=0">variety of styles</a> starting at $29, including versions with wheels and tiny hip packs.</p>

      <p>Pennsylvania-based United By Blue makes products that straddle the line between ‘hipster’ and ‘outdoor enthusiast,’ which is probably why the brand is growing in popularity with 30-somethings. Their latest product is the Bison Ultralight jacket, available for men and women. It’s insulated with bison fiber, a byproduct that otherwise gets tossed into landfills. UBB is a certified B-corp and uses only <a href="https://unitedbyblue.com/pages/sustainable-materials">sustainable materials</a> and ethical manufacturing practices to create their products, which also include shoes, sweaters and home goods.</p>

      <p>The Prana Transformation Mat scores points on both eco-friendliness and packability, making it ideal for sustainable travelers who like to strike a pose now and then. The mat is made from recycled polyester on a natural (non-Amazon-sourced) rubber base. It’s extra thin, so it folds or rolls up small enough to fit in carry-on luggage. Yogis on-the-go can use it on its own while traveling or use it as a cover on questionably clean hostel or hotel yoga mats.</p>

      <p>Ideal for travelers aiming to minimize their single-use plastics, this cutlery set fits into a small, lightweight bag, making it easy to carry around their hometowns or around foreign countries. The kit includes a fork, knife, spoon, chopsticks, stainless steel straw, toothbrush and your choice of a tumbler or insulated mug. The entire kit packs into a large Package Free-branded bag, though the smaller clip-on bag is better suited to carrying just the utensils. It’s an excellent inexpensive gift for travelers who enjoy eating out but dislike the waste that often comes with grab-and-go dining.</p>

      <p>Cotopaxi’s signature windbreaker is incredibly lightweight, folding down into a small enough package to fit in a pocket, so it’s a no-brainer for hikers. It’d make a good gift for travelers to warmer climates since it protects from whipping winds and light rain without adding warmth. This particular jacket is made with remnant fabric (fabric that would otherwise be thrown in a landfill) and a percentage of all sales go to grants for community-building non-profits. The unisex sizing ensures a comfortable fit with freedom to move, so it’s ideal for active travelers.</p>

      <p>Many companies use vegan leather, but Glass Ladder &amp; Co. takes it a step further by ensuring the leather used in the Amelia Passport Holder is completely sustainable. The company uses materials sourced from pineapples, plastic bottles and even mushrooms. Their products are made without harmful chemicals and have met various international standards for being low on resource consumption. The Amelia Passport Holder comes in a handful of mellow color options and includes pockets for a phone, credit cards and pen.</p>

      <p>Tech gifts and sustainability may not always go hand in hand, which is why House of Marley’s headphones are so unique. The over-the-ear wireless Exodus Headphones have noise cancellation and fold up for easy packing – and you get 28 hours of use on a charge, even with noise cancellation turned on (or 80 hours with it off.) It’s made with sustainably sourced wood, upcycled silicone and recycled metals. The brand also makes more affordable options with the same materials, including the $70 <a href="https://www.thehouseofmarley.com/headphones/positive-vibration2-wireless-headphones.html">Positive Vibrations 2 Wireless Headphones</a>.</p>

      <p>Sustainability doesn’t have to mean minimalism, so if you know someone who loves jewelry and accessories, consider slipping a 4Oceans bracelet into his or her stocking this year. The unisex bracelets are made from post-consumer recycled materials, including ocean plastic and sea glass. 4Ocean makes all their bracelets in Indonesia at factories that provide fair living wages and help build sustainable communities, and the organization pulls a pound of trash from the ocean for every item purchased. Bracelets are available in a variety of color schemes ranging from ‘whale shark’ to ‘jellyfish’ to ‘Everglades.’</p>

      <p>Tap water can be unsafe to drink in some parts of the world, which means travelers often have to buy water in single-use plastic bottles in a pinch. But with the Mini Water Filtration System from Sawyer, travelers can drink water from just about any source, eliminating the need to buy bottled water. The filter is super small and lightweight to fit in a purse, backpack or pocket. Using the filter, travelers can fill their reusable water bottles up from almost any source. One filter can clean 100,000 gallons of water of bacteria, protozoa, e. Coli, giardia, and almost all other water-borne risks. It’s great for adventure travelers, but also an affordable buy for anyone who spends time in developing countries.</p>
