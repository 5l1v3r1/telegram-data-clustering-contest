        <b>FC Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, reviewed his situation at the club with 'Sport' and remembered the heard times in the last few months with the club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leaving <b>Leo Messi</b> to one side, the results in the last few years for <b>Barcelona </b>have been down to <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-suarez-29685/">Luis Suarez</a>'s goals.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan, is, year on year,<b> one of the most important players for</b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona"> Barcelona </a>and since his arrival <b>he has stood out a lot at the club,</b> although his status has been put in doubt.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona fans, as demanding as most, started to <b>shout at Suarez for his performances this season</b>. Some criticisms even came at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>In the same one<b>, Luis Suarez was shouted at and booed after the debacle before Liverpool </b>and lost the final of Cup before Valencia that ended with Barcelona being defeated by 1-2. Many accused him of deleting himself to prepare for the<b> Copa America,</b> something that continues to annoy the Uruguayan.</p>
      <p><b>"It hurt me to be blamed for that defeat in the Copa del Rey.</b> Those weeks <b>they made up a lot of things about me</b>. <b>I was injured at Anfield ten minutes from the end," </b>said the striker in an interview with 'Sport'.</p>

      <p>The number '9' also reviewed <b>his current situation at the club,</b> who seems to have been looking for a replacement for the striker for a long time. Despite this,<b> Suarez says that he is very happy at Camp Nou.</b></p>
      <p><b>"I feel very happy and very valued at Barcelona.</b> Here, the standard is always very high. There is maximum demand and each year we want to win everything," he stated, who despite everything <b>also made some self-criticism.</b></p>
      <p>"It may be that at some point we have all sinned and shouted at someone at some point (to reverse a situation), but<b> I do not want to be like the bad guy,"</b> said the attacker.</p>
      <p>Among other issues, Suarez <b>also spoke of Neymar's frustrated signing last summer</b>. An incorporation that was very close to being made and for which some players, according to Piqué', were willing to modify his salary to make room for him.</p>
      <p>"What if we help finance the signing of Neymar? Well, sometimes<b> Gerard has to be caught with tweezers because he has a lot of lip,</b>" said on the matter a Suarez who trains with the rest of the group for the duel against Leganes.</p>
