      <p>CAIRO –22 November 2019: Egypt U-23 team manager, Shawko Gharib, believes that the U-23 generation will benefit the Egyptian football soon as many of the team players can support the first team. <br/><br/>“Those players will be the backbone of the senior team very soon.” Gharib said. <br/><br/>Gharib led the national team to U-23 Africa Cup of Nations Final for the first time in the history after Egypt defeated South Africa at the semi-finals to secure one of the three tickets for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. <br/><br/>Gharib added “I hope the final is going to be a match for the fans to enjoy. Our target is the title now after we secured our place in the Olympics which was our initial goal.” <br/><br/>Ivory Coast reached the final for the first time in the history after defeating Ghana at the semi-finals and they hope to be the new champion of the competition. <br/><br/>Gharib continued “Cote d’Ivoire is a very good team and I hope we both give a good image for African football.” <br/><br/>The game starts on 8:00 pm.</p>
