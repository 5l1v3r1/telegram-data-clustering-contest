        <b>Ex-Formula 1 driver Brendon Hartley says his Diriyah Formula E debut "wasn't a very successful first day on the job" after finishing 19th with two separate penalties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hartley got off to a difficult start when he crashed in FP1 after sliding wide going through the long Turn 4 right-hander and hitting the wall with the left-rear of his car, breaking his suspension.</p>
      <p>The incident was caused by the track surface breaking up, which led to a track alteration before FP2, in which Hartley only came out for two untimed laps after his car was repaired.</p>
      <p>He qualified 18th after "discovering [the track alteration] and discovering 250kW on the track" during the grid-setting session.</p>
      <p>In the race, Hartley was one of three drivers - along with BMW Andretti's Maximilan Guenther and Ma Qing Hua (NIO) - to receive a drivethrough penalty for a throttle-map infringement described in an FIA bulletin as "power out of RESS [battery] not respecting the homologated throttle pedal map".</p>
      <p>Hartley later had 10 seconds added to his race time for not using the full four minutes of his second attack mode activation, though this did not cost him a position in the final result.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a very successful first day on the job," the Dragon Racing driver told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"We had a crash in the first free practice - the track was breaking up.</p>
      <p>"[That] meant we lost the last bit of time there, and we didn't get out of free practice two. So, we were kind of on the backfoot.</p>
      <p>"We thought we had some pace in the race, but it didn't turn out to be the case - we really struggled for pace and [Dragon is] now investigating why."</p>
      <p>Hartely's Dragon team-mate Nico Muller did not make his debut as the team could not repair his car in time for the start of the race after he crashed in qualifying.</p>
      <p>Ma had 24s added to his race time for not serving his drivethrough penalty during the race, but he remained last - the only lapped finisher - after this was applied.</p>

      <p>Jean-Eric Vergne also picked up a post-race penalty as he was reprimanded and given one penalty point for speeding in the pitlane as he came in to retire with a broken steering rack in the second half of the race.</p>
      <p>Explaining his retirement, Vergne said: "I could not steer anymore, something was stuck - you cannot turn the steering wheel anymore.</p>
      <p>"[The issue started] maybe five laps in, but it was driveable - heavy, but driveable.</p>
      <p>"And then it became like [juddering] - it was only turning like this, I could not be precise anymore. [I thought] 'OK, I can continue like this not being precise, I'm gonna be slow, but maybe I can hold on and score some points'.</p>
      <p>"But in the end, it was becoming too heavy and it was very unsafe for me to drive so I took the decision to stop. It was not possible [to race] anymore."</p>
