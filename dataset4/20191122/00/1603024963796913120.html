      <p>The Minister for Road Transport and Highways was speaking at the inauguration of Agrovision, an expo showcasing a wide range of agricultural products, here.</p>
      <p>He said instead of taking so much interest in covering who is forming the next government in Maharashtra, the media should focus on farmers' issues.</p>
      <p>"Whosoever forms the government, work will be carried out in a good manner. Irrespective of whose government comes to power in Maharashtra, we will get the work done in farmers' interest. Farmers are more important...who is part of the government is insignificant," the minister said.</p>
