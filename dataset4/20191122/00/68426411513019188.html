      <p>Canada’s second-biggest lender, Toronto Dominion Bank, has been added to a global list of systemic banks that must hold extra capital, while Deutsche Bank has dropped a rank within the list, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The international body, based in Basel, Switzerland, was updating its list of systemic banks, introduced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago, when taxpayers in some countries had to bail out struggling lenders.</p>
      <p>The addition of TD Bank brings the total number of systemic banks to 30.</p>
      <p>Systemic banks are slotted into one of five buckets, although the fifth – where banks would be required to hold an extra 3.5 per cent of capital to risk-weighted assets on top of minimum requirements – remains empty.</p>
      <p>TD has been placed in the first bucket, with a 1-per-cent surcharge.</p>
      <p>TD, along with Canada’s five other big banks, is already designated a domestic systemically important bank, which subjects it to a 1-per-cent common equity capital surcharge, according to Canada’s banking regulator. Canadian banks are required to hold 8 per cent of capital to risk-weighed assets, and an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>“Management does not expect any impact to TD’s capital position with this designation,” TD said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The bank is “well-positioned to meet the [global systemically important bank] requirements starting in November 2020,” Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which regulates the industry, said in a separate statement.</p>
      <p>JP Morgan Chase remains the sole occupier of the fourth bucket, with a 2.5-per-cent capital surcharge.</p>
      <p>Citigroup and HSBC are in the third bucket, with a 2-per-cent surcharge.</p>
      <p>Deutsche Bank has dropped from the third to the second bucket, which has a 1.5-per-cent surcharge, in a sign of how the struggling German lender is shrinking and simplifying its operations.</p>
      <p>“This was primarily driven by reductions in leverage, strategic adjustments in the bank’s business and geographic perimeter and lower derivative volumes, together with wider industry developments,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Deutsche Bank is, however, still required to meet a 2-per-cent extra capital requirement as a “domestic systemically important bank,” and therefore the overall capital buffer is expected to remain unchanged, the German bank said.</p>
      <p>Changes to capital requirements come into effect in January, 2021.</p>
      <p>Banks on the list also face more onerous requirements for issuing special bonds that can be written down to replenish capital burnt in a crisis to shield taxpayers.</p>
