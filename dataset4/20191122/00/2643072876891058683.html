      <p><b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/david-west/"><u>Gracious David West</u></a></b>, Suspected Port Harcourt ‘serial killer’, has changed his plea to ‘not guilty’</p>
      <p>West is changing his plea even after confessing that he lured his victims to hotels in Port Harcourt, before drugging and murdering them.</p>
      <p>The police have a video in which West confessed to the crimes</p>
      <p>“The defendant had earlier pleaded guilty to the 9 count charge of murder but has decided to change his plea today,” prosecutor Chidi Ekeh said.</p>
      <p>However, his earlier confession was dismissed by his Lawyer, Vincent Chukwu who described them as having “no legal effect”</p>
      <p><i>“The basis of this matter is the evidence. Let them (the prosecution) put their evidence before the court”</i>, he told AFP.</p>
      <p>It was further gathered that the second suspect arrested in connection to the killings, Nimi Thankgod also pleaded not guilty and was granted bail.</p>
