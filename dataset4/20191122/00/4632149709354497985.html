      <h1>US clears HK rights bill, China warns of retaliation</h1>

      <p>The United States House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills to back protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about human rights, with President Donald Trump expected to sign them into law, despite delicate trade talks with Beijing. <br/><br/>The House sent the bills to the White House after voting 417 to 1 for the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act," which the Senate passed unanimously on Tuesday. Strong support had been expected after the House passed a similar bill last month. <br/><br/>The measure would require the State Department to certify at least once a year that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to qualify for the special US trading consideration that helped it become a world financial center. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, more than 20 protesters inside a Hong Kong university campus surrendered to police on Thursday as the city's largest pro-Beijing political party urged voters to "kick out the black force" in upcoming elections seen as a key gauge of public support for anti-government demonstrations. <br/><br/>It is unclear how many protesters are left behind. They are the holdouts from a much larger group that occupied the campus after battling police over the weekend. <br/><br/><b>'US trying to destroy Hong Kong' <br/></b><br/>China on Thursday accused the United States of seeking to "destroy" Hong Kong and threatened retaliation after Congress passed new legislation supporting the pro-democracy movement that has thrown the city into nearly six months of turmoil.</p>
