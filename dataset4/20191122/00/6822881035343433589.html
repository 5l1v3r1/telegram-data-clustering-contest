        <b>Brazil’s first LGBTI+ bank, which it says is also the first in the world, has launched its beta testing in a bid to support the gay community to bank without fear of discrimination.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Called Pride Bank, the digital prepaid rainbow-adorned credit card provided is in partnership with US-based support organisation Pride Institute – which will take 5% of the bank’s profits – and Rio’s price comparison site Welight which generates donations for non-profit organisations (NGOs).</p>

      <p>“There are so many capable people that could be making money, and making the economy greater but they’re not doing it,” Marcio Orlandi tells <i>Reuters, </i>noting how many outwardly gay people in Brazil still struggle to get jobs and maintain financial stability.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With a mind to add health insurance and travel agency services in future, Orlandi continues: “We want to make sure that this bank is not just another bank, but a bank that really looks to its community […] Making sure that we stand and we resist is really important.”</p>
      <p>Despite legalising gay marriage in 2013, Brazil is still a notably religious country where homophobia is not uncommon. Last year Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, tried to stop LGBTI+ films being publicly funded and threatened to rid school textbooks of homosexuality all together.</p>
      <p>Orlandi says that in a climate where Bolsonaro’s gay hostility could jeapordise the country’s multi-billion dollar tourist economy, the establishment of Pride Bank couldn’t come at a better time.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the world, Michigan state gave approval for LGBT-friendly Superbia Credit Union to launch in the US next year.</p>
