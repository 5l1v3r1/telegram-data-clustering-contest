      <p>Environmentally sensitive but potentially oil-rich areas of Arctic Alaska will be opened to oil development under a new Trump administration proposal to undo Obama-era protections.</p>
      <p>The proposed changes are described in a draft environmental impact statement for managing the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, a 23 million-acre (9.3 million-hectare) unit of federal land on the western side of Alaska’s North Slope.</p>
      <p>The draft, released late on Thursday by the Bureau of Land Management, contains a set of options. The most aggressive would allow oil development in 81 per cent of the reserve. Under the Obama-era management plan enacted in 2013 and currently in effect, about half the reserve is open to oil development and half is protected for its wildlife and cultural values.</p>
      <p>New oil discoveries and the westward spread of North Slope oil-field development justifies increased access for drilling, Trump administration officials argue.</p>
      <p>“With advancements in technology and increased knowledge of the area, it was prudent to develop a new plan that provides greater economic development of our resources while still providing protections for important resources and subsistence access,” Chad Padgett, BLM’s Alaska state director, said in a statement released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The draft environmental impact statement is subject to a 60-day public review. A final statement and an action decision are expected to follow, the BLM said.</p>
      <p>A former Obama administration official who helped craft the 2013 plan said the push for expanded drilling access is part of a pattern of Trump-era environmental rollbacks.</p>
      <p>“It kind of gives some of us who worked on the plan a sad feeling,” said Pat Pourchot, the Interior Department’s former top Alaska official and now a board member of the Alaska Wilderness League.</p>
      <p>“Does oil and gas trump everything in terms of natural resources? Is that the first and highest value for every acre of federal lands? I would think not,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has taken other steps to open up Arctic Alaska territory to new oil development.</p>
      <p>The BLM is planning for a lease sale in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern side of the North Slope, an area that lost its decades-long protective status when Congress passed the 2017 tax overhaul bill. That bill contained a provision requiring oil leasing in the refuge.</p>
      <p>The administration also proposed opening vast areas of Arctic waters to oil drilling. A federal judge earlier this year threw out the Interior Department’s plans for Arctic offshore oil leasing.</p>
