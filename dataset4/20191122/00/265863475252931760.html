      <p>It sounds like the feud between Ray J and Princess Love is getting worse and worse each day! This time, she claims that the rapper has decided to block her on social media!</p>
      <p>As you may know, this new detail about their drama comes after she also accused Ray J of abandoning her as well as their 18 month old daughter in Las Vegas!</p>
      <p>By the way thing are escalating, it really seems like Princess Love may be thinking of putting an end to her relationship with Ray J, regardless of the fact that she is currently expecting their second baby.</p>
      <p>A screenshot taken by The Shade Room shows that Princess Love took to her platform to tell her followers her husband had blocked her on the platform!</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, this unfortunate development in their relationship comes after she also accused the rapper of leaving her and Melody, â€˜strandedâ€™ in Las Vegas a couple of days ago after attending BETâ€™s Soul Train Awards.</p>
      <p>Supposedly, Princess wrote alongside Ray Jâ€™s account that she could no longer check out, that â€˜Somebody tell Scooty boy heâ€™s only hurting himself ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. This is so funny to me.â€™</p>
      <p>And that was not all! One fan then joked that â€˜My future husband would never,â€™ and that is when Princess gave the final blow: â€˜Mine either, sis!â€™ Yikes!</p>
      <p>It sounds like she may just be ready to move on to that â€˜future husbandâ€™ and leave Ray J behind at this point!</p>
      <p>She even tweeted: â€˜Time to let go,â€™ yesterday, seemingly hinting at the end of their marriage.</p>
