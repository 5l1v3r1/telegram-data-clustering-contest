      <p>The current house was rebuilt in the early years of the 19th century after it was burned down in the rising of 1798.</p>
      <p>Henry Stamer, magistrate for Kildare lived there. He was discovered in the house dressed as a maid by the mob, who took him away and murdered hm.</p>
      <p>Grattan Parliament paid for the rebuilding of Downings House, which had a moat and security systems and a sound proof room that folk legend Christy Moore and the future members of Planxty put to good use when they came to record their 1970 album Prosperous.</p>

      <p>The album was recorded in the soundproof vault room underneath the house. During the recording sessions, musicians such as Andy Irvine (mandolin, mouth organ), Liam Óg O'Flynn (uilleann pipes, tin whistle) and Dónal Lunny (guitar, bouzouki). </p>
      <p>The four later gave themselves the name Planxty, making this album something of the first Planxty album in all but name.</p>
      <p>Dr Rynne, a son of authors Stephen and Alice Rynne, has had just as interesting a history, particularly his challenging of the status quo in the late 70s and 80s in relation to reproductive health.</p>
