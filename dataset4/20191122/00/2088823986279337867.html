      <p>No one is accusing the executive director of the Niagara SPCA of high crimes or misdemeanors, but warning signals being sounded about his management of the facility are cause for alarm.</p>
      <p>Three members of the board of directors resigned last week, bringing the total to six board resignations in 2019. One former board member, in her resignation letter, charged Executive Director Timothy G. Brennan with failing to address medical concerns and operational problems at the shelter and refusing to follow the bylaws.</p>
      <p>Brennan’s predecessor in the job, Amy L. Lewis, says she quit her consulting role with the SPCA this year due to Brennan’s “lack of management” skills.</p>
      <p>Brennan denies any wrongdoing, and dismisses his critics. Another former board member, Jennifer R. Pitarresi, told The News that Brennan seemed resentful over having to answer questions “from well-meaning rescue partners.”</p>
      <p>Brennan, who has a background in fundraising and marketing, took over the job in August 2018. When the SPCA announced his hiring, Brennan said, “I have two passions. One is for animals and the other is for not-for-profit work.”</p>
      <p>There have been clashes over control between Brennan and some other passionate animal lovers, including board members. Pitarresi wrote in her resignation letter that animal rescue groups and other members of the public had been complaining about Brennan since January.</p>
      <p>Brennan responded that he has to deal with people, “I’ll call them activists, who think they know more about animal welfare than the people whose job it is.”</p>
      <p>Among the issues that have raised concerns:</p>
      <p>• Four dogs were put to death without approval of the SPCA’s euthanasia committee.</p>
      <p>• There is a discrepancy in two euthanasia reports obtained from the agency’s computer system last week, one saying 208 dogs and cats had been euthanized in a 14-month period, the other listing 138 deaths. Brennan told The News he would ask the software supplier to explain the discrepancy.</p>
      <p>• One of the dogs put down, a husky mix named Rez, was euthanized in a kennel, rather than in the infirmary, as is customary. In an email that a source provided to The News, Brennan acknowledged that Dr. Christopher Brown, the SPCA’s full-time veterinarian, used “very poor judgment” in the case of Rez.</p>
      <p>Bryan Barish, another of the board members who quit last week, wrote, “I have recently lost all confidence in the leadership of this organization.”</p>
      <p>Donna Shepard, the third board member to leave last week, wrote that she “can’t close my eyes to the animal care issues or irresponsible use of donor funding.”</p>
      <p>It’s impossible to know exactly where the blame lies for the breakdown in communications and trust between Brennan and the departed board members. A new board needs to get to the bottom of these issues – quickly.</p>
      <p>Board Chairwoman Susan Agnello-Eberwein told the Niagara Gazette that the board has established a new quality assurance committee to help improve operations at the Lockport Road shelter. For the sake of the animals in their care, it’s incumbent upon a newly constituted board and the director to get the SPCA back on track.</p>
