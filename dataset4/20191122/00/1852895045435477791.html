      <h1>Model Slick Woods Reveals She Has Cancer 1 Year After Walking Savage X Fenty Runway Pregnant</h1>

      <h4>Slick Woods is ‘fighting for her life’ against Stage 3 melanoma cancer, just over a year after welcoming her first child. The iconic model said she’s not a ‘victim,’ though.</h4>
      <p><b>Slick Woods</b>, whose face is synonymous with many of <b>Rihanna’s</b> brands, wants you to know one thing: she’s not a “victim.” The 23-year-old model is battling Stage 3 melanoma cancer and it’s “spreading,” which she revealed to <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5HOeZyB025/">The Shade Room</a> </i>on Nov. 20. The model added that “she’s currently fighting for her life” — melanoma cancer is considered the “the most serious type of skin cancer,” according to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">Mayo Clinic</a>. Regardless, Slick — whose real name is <b>Simone Marie Thompson </b>— remained optimistic when she took to her Instagram on Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>In lieu of a sad announcement, Slick chose to share a photo of herself sticking out her tongue by friends and wrote, “How I feel about chemotherapy, shout out to everyone that gotta go through it.” She even threw in the hashtag “#atleastimalreadybald.” Despite her lighthearted attitude, fans jumped into the comments section to offer their prayers and support, including stars like <b>La La Anthony</b> who wrote, “Love u sis ❤️.” <b>Taraji P. Henson</b> also sent love to the model, writing, “You are already on the other side of this heathy and strong like it never happened. I adore you🙌🏾🙏🏾💋💋💋.”</p>
      <p>Slick doesn’t want fans’ pity, though. A day after followers shared their well-wishes, Slick shared a photo of her 1-year-old son <b>Saphir</b> pouting. “Stop treating me like a victim,” Slick joked in the caption, but repeated “I’m not no victim” in a follow-up <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5GR7szH3Tu/">post</a> shared later that day.</p>

      <p>Slick is a revolutionary force in the modeling world, iconic for her gap tooth and appearances on major magazines like <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Vogue Italia</i>, <i>i-D</i> and Love (she was the cover star for the last two publications). She is a favorite of Rihanna’s, and most recently walked for the multi-hyphenate’s Savage x Fenty Spring/Summer 2020 show in September.</p>

      <p>Slick broke the Internet — and the status quo — by modeling lingerie with a full baby bump in tow a year prior for RiRi’s Savage x Fenty New York Fashion show in 2018. Slick really does possess a fighter’s spirit — RIGHT after the show, Slick reportedly <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/09/13/slick-woods-in-labor-model-rihanna-savage-fenty-show/">went into labor</a>!</p>
