      <p>However, the late former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s name was not considered despite moves by the City of Harare to have him honoured by having a street named after him.</p>
      <p>Also snubbed was Dumiso Dabengwa in the roads-renaming exercise.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a post-Cabinet media briefing last night, acting Information minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said Enterprise Road would be renamed Emmerson Mnangagwa Road.</p>
      <p>Mnangagwa will also have roads named after him in Kwekwe, Bindura, Gweru, Masvingo, Mutare, Chinhoyi and Chegutu.</p>
      <p>“It’s only the sitting President who has a road or building named after him when he is alive,” Ndlovu said.</p>
      <p>Selous Avenue in Harare has been renamed John Landa Nkomo Avenue after the late Vice-President, while Cameron Street will be renamed after his predecessor, Joseph Msika.</p>
      <p>The late Mujuru, a decorated former army commander who died in a mysterious inferno at his Beatrice farm in 2011, had Kirkman Road named after him, while Charter Road will be named after the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</p>
      <p>Livingstone Avenue will be renamed OR Tambo, after South Africa’s anti-apartheid hero and African National Congress stalwart Oliver Tambo.</p>
      <p>Harare Central Hospital was renamed Sally Mugabe Hospital.</p>
      <p>In Bulawayo, 6th Avenue will now be named after Mnangagwa, while Collenbrander Avenue is going to be renamed Lookout Masuku.</p>
      <p>In Mutare, Aerodrome Road will be named after the late national hero Kumbirai Kangai, while Jelf Road is going to renamed Edgar Tekere Road.</p>
      <p>In Gutu, Gutu District Office will take the new name Maud Muzenda, after the late wife to the late former Vice-President Simon Muzenda. – News Day</p>
