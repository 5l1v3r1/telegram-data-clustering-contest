      <p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand - A New Zealand jury has been asked to decide whether a British backpacker was murdered or died accidentally after a sex game went wrong.</p>
      <p>Grace Millane died last December on her 22nd birthday after meeting a man through the dating app Tinder and going back to his hotel apartment in central Auckland. The man later stuffed her body into a suitcase and buried her in a shallow grave.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the man strangled Millane to death. Defence lawyers argue the pair was engaged in consensual erotic choking that went too far.</p>
      <p>After a three-week trial, the judge on Friday summed up the case and turned it over to the jury.</p>
      <p>The name of the 27-year-old charged with murdering Millane is being kept secret for now by court order.</p>
