      <p>Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Friday attacked the BJP-led government over disinvestment of PSUs, accusing it of pursuing privatisation to "pamper" some private players.</p>
      <p>Government is selling family silver of the country to pursue privatisation and is doing so without Parliament scrutiny, he said while speaking after Question Hour.</p>
      <p>Chowdhury said, "Government is selling profit-making PSUs to pamper some private players."</p>
      <p>The Speaker then told him that the time alloted to him was over.</p>
      <p>At this point, Congress members along with Chowdhury walked out of the House.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved strategic disinvestment in five public sector undertakings including BPCL, Shipping Corporation of India and Concor.</p>
