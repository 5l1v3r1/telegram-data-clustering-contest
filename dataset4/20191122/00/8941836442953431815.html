      <p>GEORGETOWN, Del. (AP) - A former University of Delaware baseball player accused of sexually assaulting six women awaits sentencing for his rape conviction in the first case to go to trial.</p>
      <p>Sussex County Superior Court Judge Richard Stokes is scheduled to sentence 23-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clay-conaway/">Clay Conaway</a> on Friday for the June 2018 rape of a woman he met online.</p>
      <p>After a 10-day trial, a jury deliberated for about three hours before convicting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clay-conaway/">Conaway</a> of a fourth-degree rape charge in September. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison but no mandatory prison time.</p>

        <p>The woman testified that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clay-conaway/">Conaway</a> raped her after she drove to his house. The encounter occurred three weeks after they connected on the online social and dating application Bumble, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clay-conaway/">Conaway</a> sent her a nude picture of himself.</p>
