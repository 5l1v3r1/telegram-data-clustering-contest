      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST) –</b> A New Jersey food company has recalled more than 75,000 pounds of packaged salad after seven people were hospitalized with E. coli, the US Department of Agriculture announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>Missa Bay, LLC, of Swedesboro, issued the recall of 75,233 pounds of the bagged salad products sold at Walmart, Target and Aldi — fearing the romaine lettuce may be contaminated with the bacteria after an investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>A total of 17 people, one a 3-year-old, have been infected with the E. coli strain in eight states, according to the CDC.</p>
      <p>Seven people have been hospitalized and two developed a type of kidney failure. There have been no fatalities.</p>
      <p>Two people in Maryland reported eating the chicken Caesar salad produced by Missa Bay before being hospitalized.</p>
      <p>As part of an outbreak investigation, the Maryland Department of Health collected a package of Ready Pac Foods Bistro Chicken Caesar Salad from a sick person’s home and found it tested positive for E. coli.</p>
      <p>A full list of the recalled products is available online and applies to more than 30 packaged salads with the same lot of romaine lettuce believed to be from a farm in California.</p>
      <p>The salads produced from Oct. 14 to 16 have been shipped to 22 states — Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin, the agriculture department said.</p>
      <p>“Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,” the USDA warned.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of E. coli including nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and fever.</p>
      <p>Calls to Missa Bay went unanswered Thursday.</p>
