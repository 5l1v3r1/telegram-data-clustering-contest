      <h1>Kogi/ Bayelsa Election: PDP BoT Set To Take Action Over Defeat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party</b></u></a>‘s Board of Trustees is set to set up a committee to probe the activities of its members which made the party lose in the Kogi and Bayelsa states elections.</p>
      <p>The major opposition party lost in the governorship elections in the two states while the candidates of the All Progressives Congress were declared the winners.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the board, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/walid-jibrin/"><u><b>Walid Jibrin</b></u></a>, during an interview with newsmen in Abuja, said the BoT during its meeting noted the accusations and counter-accusations against its members.</p>
      <p>He noted that the probe is for the general members and adequate punishment will be recommended for those found culpable.</p>
      <p>Jibrin also stated that the board recommended a peace committee to investigate the issues in Edo, Lagos and Kano.</p>
      <p>Jibrin said, <i>“We recommended a committee that will investigate the outcome of the election in Kogi and Bayelsa.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We are very concerned with what is happening in Nigerian politics, especially recently in Kogi and Bayelsa.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We reviewed the situation and condemned in totality the issue of rigging, killings and ballot box snatching that characterised this election; we reviewed the arson that took place, including the death of a Ward chair lady of PDP in Kogi. Such things must stop.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We also viewed the accusations and counter-accusations among our members on the behaviour of some of our members both in Kogi and also in Bayelsa, especially in Bayelsa.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He charged the National Working Committee of the party to investigate the crisis within the party.</p>
      <p>Jubril noted that an interim committee must be set up, the one similar to the committee set up after the 2015 election under the chairmanship of former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and himself.</p>
      <p>There was a report that some members of the board attacked the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, for some action they felt were not good for the party.</p>
      <p>The source claimed that some members wanted to pass a vote of no confidence on Secondus which Jubril was against claiming that it was incorrect to pass such on the chairman of the party.</p>
      <p>He stated that Secondus briefed the BoT and left the meeting to attend to other party matters, adding that at no time was the issue of a vote of no confidence discussed.</p>
