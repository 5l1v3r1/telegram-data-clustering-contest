      <p>DENVER (AP) - A Colorado county has approved spending $10 million on physical and technological upgrades at more than 100 schools and on mental health programming in response to a deadly school shooting in May.</p>
      <p>Douglas County commissioners on Thursday appropriated about $7.7 million for physical safety and set aside $1.3 million for technology for schools to deploy in the future, the Denver Post reported.</p>
      <p>About $990,000 will go toward mental health programs, including curriculum, training and surveys about school culture. That’s enough to cover schools’ requests related to students’ emotional needs, said Commissioner Abe Laydon.</p>
      <p>Ninety-one district schools applied for and received some funding, along with 15 charter schools and eight private schools.</p>
      <p>Laydon said the grants won’t be able to prevent all acts of violence, but they will make it more difficult to harm children in Douglas County.</p>

      <p>Commissioners also committed an additional $3 million to partially fund 26 police officers in county schools and $331,000 in ongoing funding for a mental health response team that launched Monday.</p>
      <p>The May 7 shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch south of Denver killed 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo and left eight other students injured. Two former students have been charged in the shooting and their cases are pending.</p>
      <p>At the meeting, Commissioner Roger Partridge asked for a moment of silence to honor Castillo - who died trying to disarm a gunman - and his parents.</p>
      <p>“It was time for something to be done,” Partridge said.</p>
