      <p>By <a href="https://borkena.com/2019/10/20/privatization-of-key-assets-wont-make-ethiopia-better-kebour-ghenna/">Kebour Ghenna</a></p>
      <p>Dr. Abye Ahmed wants a new national party, so we hear. He believes the EPRDF is facing terminal crises. I have nothing against his initiative. Nor do I particularly admire his decision. The media academia, the oppositions (those with 10k members), and much of the public seem also to be totally indifferent.</p>
      <p>Why this indifference?</p>
      <p>I suppose no one thinks it makes any difference who is elected.</p>
      <p>The problems don’t go away just because there is a new election.</p>
      <p>The trouble is that no one really knows what the ruling elites of Ethiopia’s new republics want. Nor what the Federal politicians’ options are.</p>
      <p>And so, Ethiopia continues down its long, tortuous, violent road to Hell.</p>
      <p>And now, we come to the end… and the beginning.</p>
      <p>The end of an era where the incentives had been twisted and perverted, to a new era where the new elites are preparing to squeeze just about all the juice out of the nation’s assets.</p>
      <p>Here again, the people’s representatives are silently watching. Most of them have no idea what’s going on.</p>
      <p>Ethiopia will not be the first nation ruined by inept elites, runaway debt, and corrupt oligarchy. The formula is classic and so predictable. Many have followed the same route.</p>
      <p>You just borrow more than you can afford… and weaken the institutions and brokers – political parties, career politicians, and activists – that have historically tried to hold politicians accountable to one another, and prevented everyone in the system from pursuing naked self-interest all the time.</p>
      <p>Then, you open your doors to the World Bank and IMF – who made sure earlier that you got the right ratings to access external loans you cannot afford – and now bless their hearts – they call in any one or two of their multinationals buddies to do the rest i.e. grab great assets and great businesses.</p>
      <p>Will tell you nothing much will change. The best assets and best businesses will still be here after the deal. The only real difference will be who owns them.</p>
      <p>What’s coming is the greatest transfer of the little wealth we have. Over the next few years, hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of businesses, land, resources are going to exchange hands – legally, but against citizens’ will.</p>
      <p>Most likely, Ethiopia’s upcoming privatization (read de-nationalization) of its prized assets will be disguised as victory. This government will claim that we finally did it – we brought in the MTNs or Vodafones of this world to Ethiopia. This is the big day. The music starts. The lights go on. And the curtain rises… And there, on stage, Dr. Abye will salute the winner and hands him over part of the fate of the country’s economy, knowing very well that his planned privatization will hardly reduce the debts the country incurred.</p>
      <p>It’s a strange show, wouldn’t you say?</p>
      <p>And yet it doesn’t really need “new thinking,” does it? What it needs is very old-fashioned thinking – and honest restructuring of the companies, self confidence, flexibility in running the business, and public officials with enough dignity and integrity to respect the old rules.</p>
      <p>Anyway, back to our subject of the week: the new party of Dr. Abye.</p>
      <p>I’m not sure if we’ll be asked to vote for Abye or the Party. In any case, let me ask if there is any of the new party’s program you like.</p>
