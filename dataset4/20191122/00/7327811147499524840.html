      <p>SMITHTOWN, Long Island (WABC) -- From school records to county championships, Smithtown's Michael Danzi is already a standout runner.</p>
      <p>Our latest 'Future Star' now hopes to add to that success at one of the nation's top universities.</p>
      <p>As Danzi transitions from cross country to winter track, he reflects on his Suffolk County championship victor earlier in November.</p>
      <p>He is a four-time county champ, four time All-State, the number one returner in the 800 meters in spring track - but it was a different story just a few years ago.</p>
      <p>"I remember winter track my freshman year - the mile. I think in the state for out of freshman I was ranked around like over 100, so I really didn't expect to rise up to number one," said Danzi.</p>
      <p>"He already had several school records...so that meteoric rise, that's unusual for us," said Smithtown Track and Cross Country Coach Peter Schieck.</p>
      <p>In addition to excelling on the course and on the track, Danzi also excels in the classroom. He is currently taking four AP classes and has a 4.0 GPA at Smithtown High School West. He is also in three different honor societies. Danzi is committed to run with Columbia University in the fall.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, it's pretty exciting. Honestly to the college process, I didn't really expect to be going to as good as a school as that," Danzi added.</p>
