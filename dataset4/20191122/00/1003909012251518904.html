      <h1>Record number of people seek mental-health support at Calgary Counselling Centre</h1>

      <p>This year, more people are expected to request mental-health counselling than any other year in the Calgary Counselling Centre’s 57 years of operation.</p>
      <p>After breaking the record for most requests in a single month in October at 1,128, the counselling centre predicts more than 10,000 requests by the end of 2019, which would be an all-time high. While it’s positive that more people are seeking mental-health help, the record numbers are directly tied to the poor economy, according to Dr. Robbie Babins-Wagner, the centre’s CEO.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the community around employment, jobs and things like that. I think that’s driving some of the people who are coming in because we get people who are newly employed or looking for work,” said Babins-Wagner.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the year, the centre has provided more than 31,000 hours of counselling, a 17.7 per cent increase from 2018. The level of service has been skyrocketing since 2014 when the price of oil dropped and unemployment in Calgary increased. But the number of people citing unemployment as the primary reason for their counselling decreased by four per cent from last year, which is a positive change, according to Babins-Wagner.</p>
      <p>Until recently, depression and relationships were the predominant reasons people would seek counselling, however, unstable jobs, dead-end careers and unemployment have resulted in anxiety rising to the top of the list.</p>
      <p>“Some people are finding jobs but the jobs aren’t what they want or meet their specific needs, so that’s where some uncertainty comes in. For a lot of people, things are better than they’ve been but they’re still not where they need to be,” said the counsellor of 27 years.</p>
      <p>Another reason for the significant increase in clients is the reduced stigma in reaching out for mental-health help. Babins-Wagner said people of all ages, social classes and genders are coming to the centre for assistance, which leads to a healthier and safer community.</p>
      <p>“More and more people are coming in because they think it’s OK to call now, it’s OK to look for help and there are fewer barriers than there were in the past,” said Babins-Wagner.</p>
      <p>The centre has hired eight additional counsellors this year to address the increase in clients, staying true to their policy of “no wait lists.” To meet rising demand, they’ve also hired more administration and counselling students.</p>
      <p>“Through the generous support of the community we’ve been able to respond to the people coming in,” said Babins-Wagner, adding that the centre runs on grants, donations and service fees, which haven’t been increased in more than seven years to reduce financial barriers.</p>
      <p>The busiest time of the year for the centre’s counsellors is between the Christmas holidays and Easter, so she expects the numbers will rise before they fall, though she isn’t sure what kind of numbers to expect in 2020.</p>
      <p>The centre doesn’t compare its data to other Canadian cities, so Babins-Wagner says its unclear how Calgary compares with the rest of the country.</p>
