      <p>The Minority in Parliament has challenged the Akufo-Addo administration to publish the number of kindergarten blocks it has constructed since 2018.</p>
      <p>According to Ranking Member on the Education Committee of the House, Peter Nortsu-Kotoe, the government promised to construct 200 blocks to boost access to early childhood education but that is yet to materialise.</p>
      <p>“You do not see any serious attempts being made to make sure that the basic level education is given the necessary attention that it deserves,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He added, “the basic education level is in dire need of infrastructure and if that is not done the future is uncertain.”</p>
      <p>Parliament on Thursday convened to debate over the 2020 Budget and Economic Policy presented by Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta on November 13.</p>
      <p>The Minority further argued the government has paid little attention to basic education thus affecting the quality of education at the foundational level.</p>
      <p>“We need to prepare our children adequately in the basic school to enable them go to Senior High School. So if all our attention is on free SHS and we neglect the basic level, then where are we going,” he asked.</p>
      <p>Mr Nortsu-Kotoe highlighted that the government's failure to provide textbooks of the new curriculum to basic schools as an indication of the deliberate attempt to stifle education at the basic level.</p>
      <p>“What do we expect our teachers to use to teach our children?”</p>
      <p>“Due to that we are being informed that there will be no end of term examination at the basic level this term which is very sorry,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He then called on the Education Minister, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, to ensure textbooks are provided urgently since the first term of the academic year s almost ended.</p>
      <p>“We need to make sure that the adequate funds are provided,” he charged.</p>
