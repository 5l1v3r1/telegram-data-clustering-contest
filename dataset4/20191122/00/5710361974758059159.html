      <p>LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - Germany should not exclude any companies from contracts to build its 5G mobile network from the outset, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday at a meeting of her Christian Democrats at which Huawei's [HWT.UL] German ambitions are a controversial issue.</p>
      <p>Some lawmakers in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) want China's Huawei, which the United States fears could be used by Beijing for spying, to be excluded from 5G contracts.</p>
      <p>Merkel told the CDU party congress in Leipzig Germany must ensure tight security standards, but added: "We shouldn't exclude anyone from the outset."</p>
