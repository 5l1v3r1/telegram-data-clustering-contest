        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/why-bad-looks-good">Why Bad Looks Good</a>
      </p>
      <p>As much as we logically accept the fact that everyone is susceptible to being deceived, we tend to give most people the benefit of the doubt—especially people we like. You might think that your new coworker “seems honest” or “looks truthful.” Such observations suggest that you know what honesty or truthfulness looks like. Do you?</p>
      <p>Sure, good eye contact, smiling, and an <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/extroversion">outgoing</a> demeanor can make someone likable. But that does not make them truthful. Manipulators make a fortune (often literally) by capitalizing on such stereotypical judgments. You are no doubt aware of this to some extent, considering the heightened observation you likely employ when sizing up your best friend´s new paramour, or your daughter´s new boyfriend.</p>
      <p>The good news is that we can enhance our ability to judge credibility, even when interacting with people we genuinely like, through a working knowledge of some common factors that might impact our ability to reach accurate conclusions.</p>

        <b>Social Desirability</b>
      </p>
      <p>As many high profile criminal cases demonstrate, positive public image can obscure private indiscretions. Sure enough, George Visu-Petra et al. (2014) found that social desirability facilitates <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception">deception</a>.[i] They explain this is because habitually presenting oneself favorably in daily situations may include a greater tendency to lie, which makes deception easier over time. Where delayed response time often indicates deception, it is possible that individuals who routinely practice social desirability techniques may be more efficient deceivers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Familiarity Increases Credibility</b>
      </p>
      <p>We also tend to trust people we are familiar with, often regardless of context. This is often because we like them—and like merely <i>seeing</i> them, even if our interaction is limited to greetings and pleasantries. Over time, familiarity can increase both comfort and credibility, causing us to lower our guard, and making us more likely to confidently trust what we see. But should we?</p>
      <p>Not always. But one advantage of familiarity is the ability to establish a behavioral baseline against which to judge aberrant behaviors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Departure From Baseline</b>
      </p>
      <p>People often change their behaviors when lying—even when interacting with people they know well. Consider the cases of Bill Clinton and Saddam Hussein. Stephen Porter and Leanne ten Brinke in ”The truth about lies: What works in detecting high-stakes deception?” (2010) note that Clinton waggled his finger as he proclaimed he “did not have sexual relations with that woman,” thus demonstrating increased illustrator use.[ii] They note that Hussein, by contrast, decreased his illustrator use when lying. They conclude that the key to detecting deception regarding illustrator use appears to be noting a departure from a behavioral baseline.</p>
      <p>When assessing the credibility of socially desirable individuals who have become familiar, consider a few common stereotypes conflating perception and deception.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Age-Related Ability to Perceive and Deceive</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ted Ruffman et al. (2012) note that it can be easier to detect deceit in an older adult than a younger adult, and older adults were less able to separate truth from lies.[iii] Yet they explain that regardless of age, none of the participants had an advantage when judging the credibility of a same-aged speaker. Their research shows that apparently, older people might be more obvious liars, and less able to detect lies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Language Barriers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Research indicates non-native English speakers may be at a disadvantage in terms of credibility. A study by Jacqueline R. Evans and Stephen W. Michael (2014) indicated a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">bias</a> to distrust non-native speakers, believing they were lying.[iv] Researchers suggest using an interpreter may be helpful to reduce the cognitive load of the speaker, which could reduce the display of behavior that might cause bias.</p>
      <p>Even electronic communication with non-native English speakers might cause us to jump to wrong conclusions regarding credibility merely due to the use of words, phrases, or greetings that are unfamiliar or unusual.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No One Size Fits All</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whether attempting to assess credibility on or offline, no two cases are alike, and no method of lie detecting is foolproof. The analysis is complicated even further when attempting to separate credibility from likeability. Remaining aware of our own biases and potential methods of stereotypical thinking can enhance our ability to judge credibility without falling prey to stereotypes—even with socially desirable people we genuinely like.</p>
