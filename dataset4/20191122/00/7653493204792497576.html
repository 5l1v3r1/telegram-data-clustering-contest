      <p>Huawei is sending 24 Australian university students to China this weekend to take part in the Chinese networking giant’s Seeds for the Future program.</p>
      <p>The program gives STEM undergraduates the opportunity to learn about China and experience Huawei’s global business operations.</p>
      <p>After lessons in Mandarin and Chinese culture, the students will travel to Huawei’s global headquarters in Shenzhen.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2013, the program is in its seventh year and has taken more than 100 Australian students under its wing.</p>
      <p>The participants are all graduates of the Clontarf Foundation’s education program which is partnered by Huawei. The program helps improve the education and employment prospects for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</p>
