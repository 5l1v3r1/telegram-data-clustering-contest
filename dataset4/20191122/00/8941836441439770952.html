      <p>STOWE, Vt. (AP) - Snowboarders glided down a Vermont mountain Friday on the opening day of the season as a tribute to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Jake Burton Carpenter</a>, a pioneer in the sport who died this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Carpenter</a>, who founded <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burton-snowboards/">Burton Snowboards</a> in Vermont, died Wednesday of cancer complications. He was 65.</p>
      <p>In announcing his death, CEO John Lacy encouraged employees to do “what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Jake</a> would be doing” on Friday, “and that’s riding.”</p>
      <p>And so they did, taking to the slopes at Stowe Mountain Resort in the rain. They packed onto chairlifts and met at the top for a ceremony at the stone hut, a special place for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Carpenter</a>. Then they rode back down together.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a tough couple of days, but there’s nothing better than being together with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Jake</a>’s big family,” said Ian Warda, who works at Burlington-based <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burton-snowboards/">Burton</a>.</p>

      <p>Some in the crowd shared hugs, and a few had tears in their eyes.</p>
      <p>“It’s an emotional first day of the season,” said Stowe spokesman Jeff Wise. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Jake</a> loved this mountain and was an impactful and inspirational leader in the Stowe community. His legacy will live on forever here.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Carpenter</a> brought the snowboard to the masses and helped turn the sport into a billion-dollar business. He had sent an email to staff this month telling them his cancer had returned.</p>
      <p>Tributes have streamed in from athletes, industry officials and politicians.</p>

        <p>Olympic halfpipe gold medalist Kelly Clark said she was deeply saddened and said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burton-snowboards/">Burton</a> has been more like a family to her than a company.</p>
        <p>“I am so grateful for the impact <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Jake</a> has had on my life personally and in snowboarding,” she wrote.</p>
        <p>Vermont Gov. Phil Scott wrote that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Carpenter</a> was able to move mountains in a single lifetime.</p>
        <p>“From snowboarders being chased from the slopes to Olympic gold medals being placed around their necks, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-burton-carpenter/">Jake</a> led the way and changed winter as we know it,” said Scott in a written statement. “We are forever grateful for his contributions to Vermont and snow sports around the world.”</p>
        <p>This story has been updated to correct the name of the resort to Stowe Mountain, instead of Snow Mountain.</p>
