      <p>Deputy Education Minister, Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum (NPP MP, Bosomtwe) has counseled the youth to build careers for themselves ahead of pursuing partisan politics.<br/><br/>He said politics must not be seen as an end in itself but a means to an end and that all who seek to be in politics should be motivated by a desire to better the lot of society.<br/><br/>Speaking at a forum by the College of Humanities at the University of Cape Coast on Tuesday, the Deputy Minister said while he has always been connected to education through teaching and setting up of schools, he sees politics as an opportunity to transform Ghana’s education system.<br/><br/>“For me, what I know and do is not because I’m deputy education minister. I have a background in education, taught for some time, developed schools for some time, (and) led organisation for some time. So everything I like to do is about Education, and I see politics as an opportunity to transform education”, he said to sustained applause by members and students of the College.<br/><br/>“I always wanted to become a politician not because I wanted to become a politician, but because I felt strongly that if we do not transform our education system, the transformation of our nation will elude us, and invariably if you happen to be the academician… the political establishment may not pay heed to what you say much, so I wanted to be part of the establishment so that I’ll be close to the source of power and I’ll be able to talk about what we need to transform ourselves as a nation”, he explained.<br/><br/>Continuing, Dr. Adutwum said he loves politics because it gives him something that is very different and unique.<br/><br/>“So young men and women if you are thinking politics, think about career first, and walk into politics knowing that you have something to contribute to your country and not see politics as an end in itself but as a means to an end. That end of the socio-transformation of Ghana is the reason why you happen to be sitting here to be thinking about politics. It is not because of power, it is not because you get a Land Cruiser, it is not because people will worship you. That to me doesn’t make politics enjoyable.”<br/><br/>Also at the same forum, Mr Senyo Hosi, Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Bulk Oil Distribution Companies called on the government to urgently commission the various public universities to undertake a thorough study on the impact of the 4th industrial revolution on the country’s Human Resource landscape to help ascertain the necessary changes to the educational curriculum and build a system to ensure graduates are equipped with the skills they need to thrive in future.<br/><br/>Featured Video</p>
