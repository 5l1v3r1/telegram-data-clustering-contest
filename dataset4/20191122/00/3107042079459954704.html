      <p>The heatwave fuelling the devastating bushfires in Australia is drifting over the Tasman this weekend, and it's set to be a scorcher.</p>
      <p>Summer's technically still more than a week away, but tell that to Timaru - it got up to 29 degrees Celsius today.</p>
      <p>MetService forecaster Andy Best said the balmy temperatures for much of the South Island today were well above the norm.</p>
      <p>"On average this time of the year in places like Christchurch and Hokitika and Blenheim and Invercargill - temperatures [would be] between 16degC and 19degC," he said.</p>
      <p>"Whereas today we're looking at temperatures in Blenheim for example of 28degC, Ashburton 27degC, Dunedin 26degC."</p>
      <p>Chris Brandolino from NIWA said the periods of high temperatures - in some places up to 12degC above their monthly average - were to stick around for weeks.</p>
      <p>"What will define the next ... 10 to maybe even 14 days will be unusual warmth - and for many in New Zealand - unusual dryness."</p>
      <p>Hamilton, inland Bay of Plenty and Canterbury, and Wairarapa will be the hottest places, with the rest of the country likely to get well-above-average temperatures.</p>
      <p>Mr Brandolino said it was very dry in Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa, eastern Waikato, Coromandel and Northland and there was very little rain forecast.</p>
      <p>He said it was possible parts of the country could reach heatwave levels' - five consecutive days at 5 degrees above average.</p>
      <p>Fire and Emergency spokesperson John Rasmussen said the fire threat-level across the country was about average for this time of year, but that could change.</p>
      <p>"That next 10-day period of having ... considerably higher temperatures and probably along with that will be lower relative humidity.</p>
      <p>"That will certainly spike the fire dangers up across the country."</p>
      <p>He said people should be careful lighting fires or using machinery that could cause sparks in areas with scrub and tussock.</p>
      <p>Most of the country has already had sweltering temperatures this month - with two top-10 November temperature records - 33 degrees in Cheviot and 34 degrees in the Bay of Plenty - happening in the first days of the month.</p>
      <p>Mr Brandolino said hitting records so early in the month was a sign of climate change.</p>
      <p>NIWA puts out its detailed summer forecast late next week.</p>
