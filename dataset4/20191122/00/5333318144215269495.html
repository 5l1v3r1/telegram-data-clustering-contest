      <h1>Congrats, Lousada!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.innovatorsmag.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Staff reporter</a></address>
      <p>The Portuguese city of <a href="http://www.sustainablecities.eu/transformative-action-award/">Lousada</a> was named the winner of the <a href="https://iclei-europe.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e9013d745130b82733bd93884&amp;id=e8b95b34d0&amp;e=be9b4c3d5a">2019 Transformative Action Award</a> at a ceremony in Brussels this week.</p>
      <p>Held at the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) in the Belgian capital, the continent’s highly respected sustainability award event is spearheaded by <a href="http://www.iclei-europe.org/">ICLEI</a>, the Basque Country and the City of Aalborg (Denmark) and supported by the CoR and the European Investment Bank (EIB).</p>
      <p>A jury of experts picked Lousada on the back of its ‘Integrated education for sustainability’ initiative, which was recognised for its ‘potential to bring about the socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation of its community’. Highlights of the programme include the ‘planting of 40,000 native trees, with the support of over 4,500 volunteers; the restoration of over 20 hectares of degraded land; the creation of more than 20 wildlife ponds; and an increase in waste recycling by over 500 tonnes per year’. Lousada walks away with €10,000 to invest in more transformative actions in the city and the <i>Transformative Action of the Year 2019</i> award.</p>
      <blockquote>“I am deeply impressed by the work carried out by the City of Lousada and eagerly look forward to seeing how their sustainability strategy and plans develop over the coming years. I hope this prize money helps catalyze further action and I look forward to seeing those results,” said Wolfgang Teubner, Jury Member and Regional Director, ICLEI Europe.</blockquote>
      <p>During the Brussels ceremony, a new <a href="https://iclei-europe.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e9013d745130b82733bd93884&amp;id=8491fda5f8&amp;e=be9b4c3d5a">document</a> compiled by ICLEI, with the support of the City of Aalborg, and the Basque Country was launched. It shows how towns and cities and localise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
      <p>“The need for transformation towards sustainability has never been as urgent. We need a technological, socio-economic and socio-cultural transformation of our societies in order to limit catastrophic environmental consequences and ensure a decent quality of life for all. This publication shows the ability and potential of the local level to act, whilst contributing to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals on a global level,” added Teubner.</p>
