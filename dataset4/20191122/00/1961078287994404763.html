      <h1>Virus Outbreak Closes Colorado Schools for More Than 20,000 Students</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:01:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Mariel Padilla</a></address>
      <p>When a virus appeared last week, a Colorado school district closed one high school in an attempt to stymie an outbreak. A few days later, a nearby middle school was closed. By Thursday, administrators were forced to close an entire school district that serves more than 22,000 students.</p>
      <p>More than 40 schools in the Mesa County Valley School District 51 will remain closed until after Thanksgiving break, Dr. Diana Sirko, the district’s superintendent, <a href="https://www.d51schools.org/news/what_s_new/all_district_51_schools_closed_nov__21-22?fbclid=IwAR0mpfESWYkzYvMxXfduKvUQ9zmjIZ5bEykZc5BCm5u5-7rbuhaBfq7UqRk">said in a statement</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Public health officials have not officially identified the illness, but it is acting like norovirus, according to Jeff Kuhr, the executive director of Mesa County Public Health. He said symptoms included vomiting and diarrhea, and usually lasted between 12 and 24 hours.</p>
      <p>This is the first time the school district has closed all of its schools because of an illness, Emily Shockley, a spokeswoman for the district, said. Normally, schools are closed one at a time, and the last time a school was closed over norovirus was in 2014, she added.</p>
      <p>“We are taking this highly unusual action because this virus is extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools,” Tanya Marvin, the district’s nursing coordinator, said in the superintendent’s statement.</p>
      <p>The school district, stretching from the Utah border to Palisade, Colo., is the 14th largest in the state. It has 24 elementary schools, eight middle schools, four high schools, three charter schools, two K-12 schools, one middle/high school and one alternative high school, according to the <a href="https://d51schools.org/about_us">district’s website</a>. The district employs about 3,000 people.</p>
      <p>The first school to close was a high school last Thursday, Ms. Shockley said. On Monday, a middle school was forced to close, and by Wednesday, two more middle schools, a charter school and an elementary school were closed.</p>
      <p>By then, more than 5,000 students were absent from class — though officials could not be sure how many of these students were sick and how many were avoiding contagion.</p>
      <p>“It was pretty out of control,” Mr. Kuhr said. “If all the stars align, norovirus could really wreak havoc on a community. It just feels like that right now.”</p>
      <p>Many of the sick students were throwing up on the floor, not able to make it to the bathroom or a garbage can in time because they did not feel queasy beforehand, Mr. Kuhr said. Everything within a 25-foot radius of the vomit is most likely contaminated, he added.</p>
      <p>The schools tried to fight the outbreak with extra cleaning procedures. Every school that had more than a 10 percent absentee rate was wiped down, bleached and sprayed with disinfectant, according to Ms. Shockley.</p>
      <p>“The decision to close is the right move,” Mr. Kuhr <a href="https://twitter.com/MC_PublicHealth/status/1197309832744722432">said in a statement</a> Wednesday. “Past experience with these types of viruses tell us having a period of time away from close person-to-person contact can be instrumental in these illnesses running their course.”</p>
      <p>Norovirus causes the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/smarter-living/norovirus-prevention-stomach-flu-winter.html?module=inline">vast majority of stomach bugs</a> in the United States. It spreads when someone comes in contact with contaminated feces or vomit, Mr. Kuhr said. The only way to prevent it is by stopping the chain of transmission.</p>
      <p>That means keep people with symptoms away from others, clean with bleach and prioritize hygiene, he said.</p>
