      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Tennessee’s State Fire Marshal’s Office has disclosed requirements for the use of flame effect devices at events after a fire at an NFL game.</p>
      <p>The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance says the fire marshal’s office will accept two methods to show compliance with state law and adopted safety codes.</p>
      <p>Permit applicants are asked to provide information that the flame effect device meets certain requirements from the National Fire Protection Association.</p>
      <p>If that requirement can’t be met, the applicant can provide a letter from a registered engineer certifying the device is reasonably safe and does not endanger property or people’s lives.</p>
      <p>An application will not be approved if it doesn’t meet the requirements.</p>
