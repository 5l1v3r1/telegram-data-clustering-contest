      <h1>An Apocalyptic Wall of Dust Swallowed an Outback Town in Australia Yesterday</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/entire-koala-colonies-are-being-ravaged-by-australia-s-devastating-ongoing-bushfires">As bushfires continue to rage</a> in nearly every corner of Australia, an entirely different sort of nightmare has afflicted the outback town of Mildura in the state of Victoria.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, just as the sun was reaching its peak, hot, high and heavy winds in the north-west of the state of Victoria were doing the same.</p>
      <p>Amid 40-degree heat (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and warnings of disastrous wildfires, a red "wall of dust" barrelled down on the rural city and swallowed it whole.</p>

      <p>Soon enough, the sky began to glow orange, and the whirling dust and grit grew so thick, it settled like a fiery fog on the city's residents, gathering in their eyes and mouths when they ventured out in the 40 kilometre/hour winds (24 mph).</p>
      <p>As winds began to shift, the Bureau of Meteorology in Victoria <a href="https://twitter.com/BOM_Vic/status/1197335122426695680">reported</a> an 8 degree temperature drop in 30 minutes. Nevertheless, the storm remained so dense, visibility at the airport fell from 4 km to just less than 500 metres (540 yards).</p>

      <p>A senior forecaster for the bureau, Tom Delamotte, <a href="https://7news.com.au/weather/melbourne-weather/mildura-dust-storm-hits-on-code-red-day-in-victoria-c-567670?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">told</a> 7 News Australia that dust storms are not uncommon in Mildura, and given how hot and dry the region has been, this wasn't entirely unexpected.</p>
      <p>"Anytime that we have had windy conditions over the past month or two they have seen dust storms," Delamotte <a href="https://7news.com.au/weather/melbourne-weather/mildura-dust-storm-hits-on-code-red-day-in-victoria-c-567670?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">says</a>, "and given that today is very windy we are seeing quite a lot of dust picked up in the air."</p>

      <p>Even still, the frequency of these storms rings of a bigger issue. As climate change drives ever hotter and drier weather in the great south land, residents are having to get used to recurrent storms just like this one.</p>
      <p>Mildura local Sophie Appleby <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/victorian-town-mildura-unliveable-massive-dust-storm-40c-heat">told</a><i>The Guardian</i> she's now learned that the worst has arrived when the birds stop singing.</p>
      <p>"I have been here for 10 years and have never experienced anything like this," Appleby <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/victorian-town-mildura-unliveable-massive-dust-storm-40c-heat">says</a>.</p>
      <p>"We used to have a dust storm a year, this is now a weekly basis. At its worst I couldn't see across the road. This time the heat, because it is 40 °C, coupled with the dust just made it unliveable. You couldn't go outside."</p>
