      <p>SOME HOTELS in Kumasi, the capital of Ashanti Region, have been closed down because they are not operating in accordance with acceptable standards.<br/><br/>The temporal closure of the hotels formed part of a three-day intensive exercise by the Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA) to ensure professionalism in the hotel industry.<br/><br/>The exercise saw officials of the GTA in the Ashanti Region, making unannounced visits to players in the hospitality industry in the city, made up of hotels and restaurants.<br/><br/>During the exercise, hotels and restaurants that were refusing to pay the one percent Tourism Levy were also not spared as punitive measures were instantly taken against them.<br/><br/>During the visits, it was detected that some of the hotels, in particular, were not living up to expectation therefore the GTA was compelled to close them down immediately.<br/><br/>The affected hotels would only return to business, after they have corrected their mistakes by working to improve their operations to meet the standards of the GTA.<br/><br/>Prince Yaw Essah, Administrator of the Tourism Development Fund, said the exercise aimed to ensure excellent service delivery in the hospitality industry.<br/><br/>He said hotels and restaurants in the city that defaulted in the payment of the tourism levy or operated below the statutory safety and security standards would be punished.<br/><br/>Yaw Essah stated that the one per cent Tourism Levy seeks to provide funding for tourism-related projects like capacity building, development of tourism infrastructure and others.<br/>He therefore sternly warned operators who had constantly refused to pay the levy to quickly change their minds and do the right thing, to avoid having issues with the law.
