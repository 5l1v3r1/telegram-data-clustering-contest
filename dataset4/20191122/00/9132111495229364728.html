      <p>Chieftaincy in Ghana is a big deal mainly because the institution was the core system of governance and adjudication before colonial rule.</p>
      <p>The opinions of kings on a variety of issues in the country were and are very much respected and valued even by present day governments.</p>
      <p>In the past, one becomes a king or queen only if the person is from a royal lineage.</p>
      <p>However, due to the modern trends and influx of foreign culture and diversity, there has been a fluidity of chieftaincy in Ghana which has allowed for non-Ghanaians to be enstooled as chiefs.</p>
      <p>These foreign chiefs and queens are purposely enstooled to promote development in the villages where they are enstooled. They are usually referred to as ‘Nkosuohene’ (Development King) or ‘Nkosuohemaa’ (Development Queen).</p>
      <p>Below are some of the non-citizens who earned the title.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Roland James Moxon</b>
      </p>
      <p>Known as the first ‘white man’ to be enstooled in Ghana, Jimmy Moxon alias Nana Kofi Onyaase was a traditional chief of Gold Coast after his contract with the British colonial administration ran out.</p>
      <p>Born in Streusbr, Britain, on January 7, 1920, Roland Jmaes Moxon, in real life, showed his passion for rural administration and related very well with the local people.</p>
      <p>Due to his good relations, he was able to withstand the difficult times in an era of a series of anti-colonial rioting prior to independence.</p>
      <p>James Moxon was enstooled on the eve of independence as Nana Kofi Obonyaa Onyaasahene which in English means chief of the patch of land under the silk cotton tree where his cottage stood.</p>
      <p>He later became Ankobiahene of Aburi, a genuinely important position in tribal culture.</p>
      <p>After several years of service to the people, Jimmy passed away in 1999 at age 79.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lisa Raye</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lisa Raye is an American actress, model and entrepreneur. She was enstooled as a queen mother of Agona Kwanyanko in the Central region during an installment ceremony in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The screen goddess was chosen for the role by the paramount chief of Agona Kwanyako, the chiefs, and the entire Kyidom Traditional Divisional Council.</p>
      <p>She is said to have earned her title as queen mother because of her humanitarian efforts.</p>
      <p>In response to her new role, Raye promised the people that she will do her best to support.</p>
      <p>However, in an interview on The Wendy William Show, Lisa Raye who probably did not understand her title confused it as one that makes her “the Queen mother of Ghana". A blunder which did not go down well with many Ghanaians.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Michael Jai White</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hollywood actor and martial artist, Michael Jai White, was enstooled as ‘Odupong’ of Akwamu Traditional Area by HRM the Akwamuhene Odeneho Kwafo Akoto III – Akwamumanhene.</p>
      <p>The title was bestowed on him during his visit to Ghana with other top Black Hollywood celebrities who chose Ghana as a destination for their vacation and to reconnect with their roots.</p>
      <p>His wife, Gillian Illiana White, who was not on the trip could not hide her joy when she posted a photo of the coronation with excitement.</p>
      <p>“Soooo, yesterday my husband Michael Jai White was enstooled (crowned) a king of Akwamu in Ghana. He is now a Ohene (King) with the title of Nana Akoto lll, Odopon “The Tree With Strong Roots That Does Not Fear…” She wrote on her Instagram.</p>
      <p>Michael Jai White is known to be the first black person to portray a major comic book superhero in a major motion picture, having starred as Al Simmons, the protagonist in the 1997 film Spawn.</p>
      <p>He has starred in various movie roles on the Hollywood screen including portraying boxer Mike Tyson in the 1995 HBO television movie Tyson.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rita Marley</b>
      </p>
      <p>Known in real life as Alpharita Constantia Anderson, she was born in Cuba on July 25, 1947, and was raised in the Trenchtown neighbourhood of Kingston, Jamaica.</p>
      <p>She is a renowned reggae artiste and wife of late Reggae music icon, Bob Marley.</p>
      <p>The award-winning actress, besides pursuing her artistic career, started to commit herself in solidarity projects in Africa, founding two organisations:</p>
      <p>The Bob Marley Foundation, to uplift her husband’s music and memories through a number of events including Bob Marley’s annual birthday party in Jamaica and the Rita Marley Foundation, that operates in Ghana and Jamaica to fight poverty, hunger and inequality in the developing countries.</p>
      <p>In Ghana, the reggae queen was conferred ‘nkusuohemaa’ in the Eastern Region of Ghana.</p>
      <p>According to the Rita Marley Foundation, “In year 2000 Mrs. Rita Marley was enstooled as Nana Afua Adobea (Queen of Development) in Konkonkuru, Ghana. A patron of the Konkonuru Methodist Schools in the Aburi Mountains of Accra Ghana, Nana, as she is affectionately called, assisted over 200 children of the Konkonuru Methodist Schools. She is always soliciting assistance for the children and the Konkonuru community. Nana Rita has successfully spearheaded the repairs to the main road as well as the provision of bore holes to supply safe and clean water. Nana Rita has built the Alpha &amp; Omega Home for the Aged and a clinic to serve residents of Konkonuru.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Michael Jackson</b>
      </p>
      <p>The King of Pop had always ensued a sense of belongingness when it comes to Africa. This was notable when he first paid a visit to Senegal explaining how he fell in love with the continent on a trip to the country with the Jackson Five when he as a teenager.</p>
      <p>"Drums and sounds filled the air with rhythm. I was going crazy … This is it. This is where I come from. The origin." He said.</p>
      <p>It is no surprise when he graciously accepted the Chieftancy title of a former Ghanaian group known as the Kingdom of Sanwi in 1992.</p>
      <p>According to reports by mentalfloss.com, a tribal chief insisted that the Pop star descended from the Sanwi royalty and was therefore a king-in waiting.</p>
      <p>After his crowning as king, Jackson thanked the people in both French and English and then signed the relevant documents to make his coronation official.</p>
      <p>The Agni people, reports suggest belong to the Kingdom of Sanwi, which was formerly located in Ghana. Information available shows that it is presently in Cote D’Ivoire after they moved there in 1740.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Isaac Hayes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Renowned African-American singer of the 1970s, Isaac Hayes, was enstooled the nominal chief for development of the Ada traditional area under the stool name of Nene Katey Ocansey I, in December 1992.</p>
      <p>He was a member of the Ocansey Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Five years after being enstooled, Hayes returned to Ada and presented a cheque of $10,000 for the construction of a training centre in the town.</p>
      <p>In his speech during a ground breaking ceremony for the institute at the Ada Secondary School, Black Moses, as he is popularly known, noted that Ghanaians have a very high work ethics and said the study technology will enable the country's development efforts to become "easier, more precise and effective.”</p>
      <p>He is also known to have sponsored 52 teachers to study technology training programmes. Later, three teachers were sent to the USA to finish their training at a higher level</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Philantropic musician passed on August 10, 2008 but his benevolence has been well impacted on the people of Ada and worldwide.</p>
