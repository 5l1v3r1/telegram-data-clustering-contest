        <b>A Sony patent for a cartridge has been creating considerable speculation recently, with some believing the PlayStation 5 could come with a game cartridge slot while others opined the patent heralded the introduction of external SSDs for the next-gen console. However, it appears the device in the patent drawing is actually destined for use with Sony’s Toio platform.</b>

      <p>There’s no denying any <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-First-showcase-unveiling-specific-release-date-price-and-prime-launch-title-details-leaked.443452.0.html">news</a> about the PS5 can generate excitement nowadays, as the reveal of the next-gen console draws closer. Unfortunately, one suspected PS5-related leak can now be consigned to the “unrelated” folder – the rumored PS5 game/SSD cartridge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-cartridge-ps5-console/">LetsGoDigital</a> has been informed by an industry insider that the patent drawing, which was later turned into renders of rather convincing game cartridges and even more convincing potential external SSD upgrades for the PS5, is for nothing more than a Toio game cartridge.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, a game cartridge function for the PS5 would seem quite odd, and we originally <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Speculation-of-PlayStation-5-game-cartridge-function-or-PlayStation-Vita-2-development-fueled-by-patent.442585.0.html">speculated</a> on the possibility that the patent was for a Toio-related product. However, there was a general agreement – and excitement – over the potential of the cartridge being expandable SSD storage for the PS5. It might be worthwhile for Sony to latch onto the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-console-might-come-with-expandable-storage-in-the-form-of-external-SSD-cartridges.442703.0.html">interest</a> that was shown for that particular speculation and maybe implement a similar system for its next-gen console.</p>
