      <h2>In September 1967, I was working one of my jobs in the principal's office in reception. I had boyfriends in high school that I cared about. They were 17 just as I was. Only being boys, they were being drafted to Vietnam. They were scared. My whole mindset was to save enough money to go to Chicago Art Institute. They were trying to stay alive. So two boyfriends came in to ask me if I would follow them outside. So I did. Outside in the bleachers were many of the students. They were protesting the Vietnam War and dress code. My friends basically pushed me up the scaffold into the platform. To this day, I’m not sure why they thought that I could do something they couldn’t. On the platform were reporters. His name was Mr. Lynch. He shoved a microphone in front of me and barked: “Why are you students doing this?” I looked at my friends and yelled back: “because I don’t want my friends to die!” Later on when it was all over the news, and my Dad had seen it before he saw me, he told me that this is the wrong war and if I was a boy, he would be bringing me to Canada. And oh, by the way: “ I didn’t know that you had it in you.” I loved my family and never ever wanted to leave Chicago. I graduated in 1968 and I was accepted to Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. I was one of six students from high school from the metropolitan area of Chicago. Evidently, no one was accepted directly from Chicago Art Institute our of high school. Of course I was devastated but I figured that I would transfer when I could. Hair was playing next door to CAFA. I went there in the beautiful clothes that my grandmother purchased for me from Marshal Fields. A guy my age came up to me with hair down his back, jeans and no shoes and said to me: “How can you dress like this?” I was thinking the same about him. I had saved every penny except $200 which my parents assured me they would cover. After that I could keep working part time jobs and do what I had to to get through school. To this day, it’s hard to put this in writing. My mother and I had a different relationship once her sister had come to live with us. We were never as close as we had once been after that. I didn’t realize at the time, that my mother had to quit grammar school to help financially with her family. There was a resentment there. So when it came to the $200 she laughingly told me to forget it. I could go back to work Monday and forgot school. The betrayal stayed with me for many years. I put my art supplies away and worked for two years and saved. I’m not sure why I did t make other decisions. Somehow I felt that being an artist or going to college was a betrayal of my family. This thinking was before I realized that every life has a journey, a timing, a kind of spiritual magic all of its own. These were the last two years that I would ever live with my family. My mother, like most mothers, if her spirit knew this, would have wanted that extra time. The 1969 Democratic Convention happened, my boyfriend came back from Vietnam. He came back screaming and stopping the car in the middle of the street and screaming some more. One night he went to hit me. I almost broke his hand. I said, “That would not be allowed.” I broke up with him among many flurries and Private occurrences. He became a stalker. My mother called my uncle who was a Jesuit. He was also Dean of Students of Santa Clara University. My mother’s parents had moved to San José when I was born. They had lived there and we had visited. My grandfather who was a Mason was not thrilled that my uncle wanted to become a priest. My Uncle Steve used to baby sit me before they moved. He spoke seven languages and had a Masters Degree in Spanish that he attended in Spain. He called for me to come to Santa Clara for a few months. I did. I felt like I could breathe. I brought our my art supplies, went to parties, made friends. It was wonderful. I got a job for the summer and an apartment with roommates in San Francisco. My mother decided to come and get me. I drove with her in the car all the way back to Chicago. One night, the old boyfriend called. He was going to come back to get me. I could tell he was high on something. I called the police and had him removed from our home. My mother called my uncle. I was sent back to Santa Clara. And, then, only then was I allowed to go to college. I was almost 21. I began, as my uncle’s niece to attend Santa Clara University. I began art classes immediately.</h2>
