      <h1>In suit, Hawaii woman claims baby powder contaminated with asbestos made her sick</h1>

      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A Big Island woman diagnosed with mesothelioma has sued Johnson &amp; Johnson for selling baby powder she claims was contaminated with asbestos.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Jacqueline Becker filed the suit Thursday morning in Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Becker was diagnosed in February with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer. Becker, an equestrian and show rider, regularly used Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder on her body and to care for her horses.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a big, horrible experience,” Becker said.</p>
      <p>She joins thousands of others around the country who are suing the company over its baby powder.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Justice Department has opened an investigation to determine if Johnson &amp; Johnson misled the public about asbestos risk in talc-based products. Asbestos is known to cause cancer.</p>
      <p>And the main cause of pleural mesothelioma is asbestos, the American Cancer Society reports.</p>
      <p>Last month, Johnson &amp; Johnson issued a recall of 33,000 bottles of baby powder after FDA testing showed asbestos contamination in one of the bottles.</p>
      <p>At the time, Johnson &amp; Johnson said that "thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos.”</p>
      <p>Becker moved to Hawaii in 1991 from Australia. A court date for the suit hasn’t yet been set.</p>
