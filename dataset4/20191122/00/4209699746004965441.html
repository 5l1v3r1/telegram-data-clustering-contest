      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he “can afford to be reckless because” he would not be needing the votes of Nigerians again in another election.</p>
      <p>Buhari made the declaration on Friday during the National Executive Committee meeting of the All Progressives Congress in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.</p>
      <p>He said that apart from the fact that age was no longer on his side, he would not seek a third term in office because it was not backed or supported by the Nigerian constitution.</p>
      <p>Buhari said, “I am not going to make mistake of attempting a third term or whatever term.</p>
      <p>“Besides age, I swore by the holy book that I believe in and will go by the constitution.</p>
      <p>“I know I am in my last term and I can afford to be reckless because I am not going to ask for anybody's vote.”</p>
      <p>In recent days, there have insinuations by some politicians that Buhari was preparing the way for a third term in office.</p>
      <p>Though those around him had always denied such moves, Buhari’s statement on Friday may have put paid to any such talk. </p>
