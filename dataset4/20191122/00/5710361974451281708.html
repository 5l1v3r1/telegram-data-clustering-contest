      <h1>Mediaset plans meeting in hope of breaking deadlock with Vivendi</h1>

      <p>MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset will hold a special shareholder meeting to try and reach agreement with Vivendi over its plan to set up a holding company, the Italian firm said on Friday, as the pair head to court to try and resolve their dispute.</p>
      <p>Mediaset (MI:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/mastercard-cl-a">MA</a>) remains determined to push ahead with its plans for a pan-European holding company to drive international growth, despite objections from its No. 2 shareholder Vivendi (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/vivendi">VIV</a>).</p>
      <p>In a statement ahead of a court hearing to address a request from Vivendi to suspend the pan-Europe TV plan, Mediaset said an attempt at conciliation with the French group "has not, as things stand, resulted in a positive outcome".</p>
      <p>However, in a sign it still hoped for a resolution to the dispute, it said a special shareholder meeting would be held on Jan. 10 to vote on a number of proposed amendments to the project that it hoped could break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>The two groups were given until Friday by a Milan court to reach a compromise in the dispute.</p>
      <p>Following a board meeting, Mediaset said plans for the new Dutch holding dubbed MediaForEurope (MFE) were a strategic priority and would go ahead, adding that "the MFE Project is essential for the future of the Mediaset group".</p>
      <p>It said the importance of the project meant it was ready to accept suggestions received during the conciliation process and a number of amendments would be put forward for approval on Jan. 10.</p>
      <p>"By acting this way ... the Board of Directors hope to gather the approval also by those shareholders who have elected to oppose the MFE Project," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>No comment was immediately available from Vivendi.</p>
      <p>Vivendi is challenging the plan in the courts as it includes a governance structure that would help Fininvest, the holding company of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, to tighten its grip over Mediaset.</p>
      <p>A source with knowledge of the case said the companies might ask a judge to give them extra time to negotiate.</p>
      <p>One of the main stumbling blocks has been price. A source on Thursday said Vivendi was prepared to sell the 20% Mediaset stake held by its Simon Fiduciaria trustee at a price of 3.25 euros each, below the 3.7 euros paid three years ago to build an overall 29% stake.</p>
      <p>Mediaset has offered 2.77 euros to repurchase shares of investors wanting to opt out of its MFE plan.</p>
      <p>Failure to reach a deal over its pan-European plan could complicate Mediaset's efforts to tackle increasing competition from streaming services such as Netflix (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/netflix,-inc.">NFLX</a>) and Amazon Prime (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/amazon-com-inc">AMZN</a>).</p>
      <p>Mediaset shares were trading up 2.4% at 2.7 euros at 1410 GMT.</p>
      <p>"We don't know what is going to happen in the next few hours or days, but today's press reports suggest a good execution of Mediaset's European project is now more likely," one Milan trader said.</p>
