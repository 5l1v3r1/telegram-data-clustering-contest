      <p><b>Newsbrief:<i> </i></b><i>Overwatch</i> maker Blizzard Entertainment and Chinese distributor NetEase have been awarded 4 million yuan ($569,000) after a court found Chinese publisher 4399 Network guilty of copyright infringement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1911136007/">As reported by Shine</a> (a digital Shanghai Daily supplement), the Pudong New Area People's Court found that two of 4399 Network's titles, <i>Clash of Fighters</i> and <i>Gunplay Battlefront</i>, intentionally copied aspects of <i>Overwatch</i> including specific character designs, maps, and gameplay elements.</p>
      <p>4399 Network had attempted to argue that <i>Overwatch </i>itself actually pulled similar elements from other popular games, and therefore it couldn't be accused of copyright infringement. The court, however, sided with Blizzard and NetEase, resulting in the payout.</p>
