      <p>Former head coach of Trinidad and Tobago’s Senior team Stephen Hart is coy on whether he would coach that country’s team again if there was a change of administration in the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation on Sunday.</p>
      <p>William Wallace and Richard Ferguson are challenging incumbent David-John Williams for the president at Sunday’s Annual General Meeting and Elections.</p>
      <p>According to media reports in Trinidad and Tobago, John-Williams’ four-year term has been marred by controversy and he does not enjoy the public trust.</p>
      <p>Legal battles, the poor performance of the national teams, and the perceived lack of transparency involving major projects have hurt his presidency. However, according to observers, it is unclear whether these issues will see him losing on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the outcome on Sunday, Hart, who was awarded a TT$5 million judgment for his wrongful dismissal by the TTFA in 2016, does not see himself returning the job as head coach.</p>
      <p>“First, there is already a coach in place and I have to respect that,” he said. “Were there not a coach in place I would really have to think about it because right now the football is in a very difficult situation.</p>
      <p>“There is little to play for. They are already out of the World Cup. There is a very slim chance of getting into the Gold Cup and unless they are committed to a number of years in terms of building back something and programming, it would be difficult for me to say yes at this point.”</p>
      <p>However, it’s not as if he is looking for work. The 59-year-old Hart is the General Manager of the HFX Wanderers, a new team in the newly formed Canadian Premier League.</p>
