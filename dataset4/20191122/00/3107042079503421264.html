      <p>He spent the weekend baking and collecting toys to take to workers and victims of the attack.</p>
      <p>The school's Kapa Haka Group also put on a performance.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles addressed the crowd and offered condolences on the tragic loss that was endured.</p>
      <p>"I may know something of the terrible anguish, I can appreciate the tense grief you have faced and the despair that can result," he said.</p>
      <p>"The only possible remedy is hope.</p>
      <p>"The remarkable efforts of the students have made a great difference and are worthy of the highest praise.</p>
      <p>"All of the communities have stood proudly with their Muslim brothers and sisters.</p>
