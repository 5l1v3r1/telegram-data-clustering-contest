      <h1>Woolies Trials Self-Serve Checkouts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/computer-daily-news/" target="_blank">Computer Daily News</a></address>
      <p>The Woolworths supermarket chain has introduced a new self-service checkout which it says has been designed to combat an ongoing issue related to emerging technology.</p>
      <p>It is trialling the use of so-called “trolley self-serve lanes” – pictured – at a newly opened store Millers Junction in Melbourne’s south-west, and in Sydney’s Gregory Hills store. Customers who use these lanes will load their groceries onto a conveyer belt before scanning them at a self-service register.</p>
      <p>Woolies says that the self-service trial will coincide with the introduction of “Scan&amp;Go” technology. This is claimed to allow customers to scan products with their smartphones as they shop, before making payment through an app linked to their credit card.</p>
      <p>The company insists that “trolley self-serve” won’t see existing staff shown the door. “We’re pleased the Millers Junction store will provide ongoing employment to more than 100 team members, many of whom will work at the front-of-store to serve our customers,” a spokesman said.</p>
