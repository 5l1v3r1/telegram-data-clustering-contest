      <p>INLAND EMPIRE - (INT) - Forecasters are becoming more confident of a major Thanksgiving storm striking Southern California during the busy holiday travel period. <br/><br/>KEY POINTS <br/> Increased confidence in major winter storm Wednesday through Friday <br/> Widespread moderate to heavy rain, with heavy snow likely in the mountains. <br/> Threat of localized flooding, debris flows, and hazardous travel conditions for the holiday period. <br/> <br/>The National Weather Service is warning that several inches of rain my fall in the valleys and along the coast. The highest precipitation totals are likely in the mountains with the deserts getting the least. Localized flooding is possible and there is a threat of debris flows in/near areas scarred by recent wildfires. Temperatures will turn colder Thanksgiving Day into Black Friday with lower snow levels at many mountain communities. <br/><br/>All this is the result of a storm developing off the Pacific Northwest and then diving south into California. Forecast models depicting storm totals of 2-4 inches or more across Southern California with higher totals focused near the mountains in <br/>orographically-favored areas. <br/><br/>For the time being, expect a pleasant weekend with fair, dry and warmer weather through Monday.</p>
