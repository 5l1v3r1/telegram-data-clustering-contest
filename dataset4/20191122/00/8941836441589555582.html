      <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - A career anti-tax initiative promoter who has been accused by the state attorney general of using campaign donations for his personal use has announced he’s running for governor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tim-eyman/">Tim Eyman</a> made the announcement while testifying at a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sound-transit/">Sound Transit</a> board meeting Thursday in Seattle. The board was meeting about possible legal action against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tim-eyman/">Eyman</a>’s Initiative 976, which voters approved earlier this month. The measure cuts car tabs to $30, which the state has said will lead to deep cuts in road and public transit projects.</p>
      <p>KIRO-TV reports <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tim-eyman/">Eyman</a> says he will file paperwork Monday. If he does, he’ll join a handful of lesser-known candidates who have already declared against Democratic incumbent Gov. Jay Inslee.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tim-eyman/">Eyman</a> has been the subject of a long-running lawsuit by Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who says that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tim-eyman/">Eyman</a> violated state campaign-finance laws and covertly used his initiative drives to enrich himself.</p>
