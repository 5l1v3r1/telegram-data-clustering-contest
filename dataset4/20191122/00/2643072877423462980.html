      <p>Mompha filed the fundamental rights enforcement suit before a High Court of Lagos State.</p>

      <p>Also, Mompha is demanding a court order directing the EFCC to release him unconditionally from its custody.</p>
      <p>He is also asking for a court order of perpetual injunction restraining the anti-graft agency or any person whatsoever acting for or on behalf of the agency from arresting and detaining him in relation to the subject of the suit without recourse to due process of law.</p>
