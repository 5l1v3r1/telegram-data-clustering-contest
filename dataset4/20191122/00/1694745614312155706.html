      <h1>Pete Davidson Transformed Into a Naked Ken Doll, and I'm . . . Uncomfortable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:43:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:43</time> by <a rel="author">Chanel Vargas</a></address>
      <p>Pete Davidson is one of the two cover stars for <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-pete-davidson-2641400317.html?rebelltitem=29#rebelltitem29"><b>Paper</b> magazine's #BreaktheInternet issue</a> this year (BTS is the second), and he left nothing to the imagination in his unique cover shoot. The spread reimagined the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Saturday-Night-Live"><b>Saturday Night Live</b> star</a> as a giant Ken doll complete with biceps, abs, and, uh, no pants. Also, where did his nipples go?</p>
      <p>Pete was joined by a model dressed like Barbie herself, and they had more than a little fun together. The two did everything from tanning in the back garden to enjoying a bubble bath together. There were even a few more risqu√© photos that showed Barbie with her zebra-print heel pressed on his crotch, which definitely seemed like a nod to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/who-has-pete-davidson-dated-46855940">his "HUUUUGE" BDE (Big D*ck Energy)</a>.</p>

      <p>Aside from participating in the imaginative photo shoot, Pete sat down with <b>Paper</b> to discuss everything from his career as a stand-up comedian to his personal love language. In response to whether he prefers one specific love language over another, Pete said, "I do all that sh*t! My love language, when I'm in a relationship, is I treat the person I'm with like a princess."</p>

      <p>Pete then went on to say that the amount of effort put into a relationship is key, and it's important to strike the right balance between intimacy and personal space when you're seeing someone. "I try and go as above and beyond as possible, because that's what you're supposed to do," said Pete, who recently confirmed <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/pete-davidson-kaia-gerber-kissing-at-nyc-concert-photos-46917645">his relationship with model Kaia Gerber</a>. "If you're in a relationship with someone, you're just supposed to make that person feel as special as possible. But sometimes when you put so much on someone, it overwhelms them and then they don't know if they could come close to that."</p>

      <p>When it comes to taking care of himself, Pete said cutting the internet and social media out of his life was one of the best decisions he ever made. "I got rid of the internet because I can't be on it," he said. "Anytime I would go on, I would just see horrible things written about me all the time . . . I would look through the search tab on Instagram and I'm a meme! I'm multiple memes. I'm punchlines or set-ups to jokes, so social media's a little different for me. I had to get rid of it."</p>
      <p>Pete added that he prefers in-person interactions over social media interactions, anyway. "Also, dude, it's like, anytime you put something on the internet or type it out, it could be interpreted so many different ways," he said. "When you see the person saying it, there's no mistaking it at all, so I'm just saving everything for stand-up, and for, you know, sh*t like that."</p>

      <p>It's a little difficult to imagine interacting with a life-size Pete Ken doll IRL, but if his photos are anything to go by, it definitely looks like a wild time.
