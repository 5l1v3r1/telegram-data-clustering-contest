      <p>The Embassy of the Lebanese Republic in Ghana has awarded scholarships to the best law students in the Faculty of Law of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). Ambassador Maher Kheir, Lebanese Ambassador to Ghana, presented the scholarships at the 7th Scholarship Awards Ceremony at the Faculty of Law Auditorium.</p>
      <p>Presenting the scholarships, Ambassador Maher Kheir said Ghana and Lebanon have cooperated and maintained good relations over the years. He said despite the critical situation that Lebanon finds itself in; his outfit will continue to support Ghanaian students through the scholarship scheme.</p>
      <p>He noted that every great nation is built on the practice of law, which is the sharpest sword against injustice, unfairness, and corruption. Law promotes fairness and its students are the inspiration and hope of the future in the building of a patriotic nation, he added.</p>
      <p>Dean of the Faculty of Law, Professor (Mrs.) Lydia Apori Nkansah commended Ambassador Kheir for continuing the legacy of His Excellency Ali Halabi, the former Ambassador. Prof. Mrs. Apori Nkansah said investment in law goes a long way to affect the governance and development of countries positively.</p>
      <p>She said Ghana as an emerging middle-income economy with diverse human resources, needs legal services in order to keep up with the competition in the global economy. In addition, investorsâ€™ attraction to an economy is dependent on their confidence in the legal system.</p>
      <p>She, therefore, commended the Embassy for their investment in law students as quality legal education requires a financial investment.</p>
      <p>Provost of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Professor Imoro Braimah, advised the beneficiaries to learn hard and give back to society. He further encouraged them to form an alumni network.</p>
      <p>The awardees were Asabre Kwame Michael, Ofori Atta Maame Akua, Tuffour Ampem Nana Akua, Isaac Awotwe, Emmanuel Boamah and Sylvanus Akotigah. Others were Adwoa Serwaa Asamoah, Bentsi-Enchill Benjamin, Cudjoe Ezekiel, Sefakor Jasmine, Esinam Vivian S. Woanyah and Waana-ang Martin.</p>
      <p>The Scholarship package, which is strictly based on academic performance and financial status of students, covers tuition fees, and other educational expenses.</p>
