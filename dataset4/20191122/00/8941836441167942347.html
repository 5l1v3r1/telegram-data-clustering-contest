      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> has pulled more than a dozen skin-lightening products with dangerous mercury levels off its website after pushback from Minnesota public-health and environmental activists.</p>
      <p>The Seattle-based company’s change came after the BeautyWell Project and the Sierra Club’s state branch delivered a petition on Wednesday with over 23,000 signatures to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a>’s fulfillment center in Shakopee.</p>
      <p>That day, the two organizations also took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper demanding that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> stop selling toxic skin-lightening creams. The ad had three words in bold print - “Dangerous, racist, and illegal.”</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> spokesperson told Minnesota Public Radio News in an email Thursday that such products are “no longer available.”</p>
      <p>As of Thursday, all but one of the 15 products with high mercury levels appeared to be removed from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a>’s website.</p>
