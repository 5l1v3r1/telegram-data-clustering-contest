      <h1>Antonio Conte Reveals the Sexual Advice (Yes, Really) He Gives All Players During the Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Antonio Conte has publicly admitted he advises players to use 'the minimum of effort' during sex while the football season is ongoing, in order to save energy and avoid injuries before matches. </p>
      <p>It's a topic that doesn't come up too often when discussing football, but Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was once said to have banned players from intercourse altogether before matches. </p>
      <p>And while new <a href="http://90min.com/teams/inter">​Inter</a> boss Conte doesn't quite go that far, the advice he gives his players is somehow more disturbingly intimate - admitting in an interview with French media this week that he advises players to have less frequent, less strenuous sex, the law *<i>sigh</i>* getting laid down in no uncertain terms. </p>

      <p>He also requested that they keep it with their partners, because otherwise it requires 'extra action.'</p>
      <p>"During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Antonio-conte-je-suis-un-esprit-libre-pas-un-leche-cul/1082294">​L’Equipe</a>. "And use positions where they are under their partners. And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action."</p>
      <p>We're not going to ask Conte what he means by 'extra action' because we've already had too much information from him on this matter. And we're <i>definitely </i>not going to speculate on how he knows that, because 90min's lawyers are otherwise occupied this week.</p>

      <p>As, eh, unorthodox as his advice may seem, however, his 'lie back and think of me, Antonio Conte, think of Antonio Conte' theory might actually be working at Inter. </p>
      <p>His new side have lost just once domestically this season - 2-1 to <a href="http://90min.com/teams/juve">​Juventus</a> in October - and they sit just a point off Maurizio Sarri's men at the summit of Serie A, looking set to push them all the way in their bid to regain the title. </p>
      <p>They haven't quite fared as well in Europe after landing in the Champions League group of death, having won just once in their four games so far, but they have the chance to cut the gap on <a href="http://90min.com/teams/barcelona">​Barcelona</a> and Borussia Dortmund when they face Slavia Prague on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Their next European fixture after that comes at home to group leaders Barça in their final group game. Better give your other halves a heads up before that one, lads. </p>
