      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:14:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>As the Rajya Sabha debated the issue of air pollution in Delhi, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said the capital’s air quality has improved over the last three years and that the number of ‘good’ and ‘moderate’ days has increased. “As per continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations data, there is general improvement in air quality of Delhi,” Javadekar said.</p>
      <p>Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa hit back, referring to a recent tweet by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who had advised that eating carrots would help beat air pollution. “They are asking us to eat carrots. Are we goats?” he asked the minister. Bajwa also referred to a tweet by Javadekar in which he said people should start their day by listening to music. “He knows that people’s lungs are stuck now, (their) throats are choked and eyes are not responding as tears are coming out. We are already facing the music,” Bajwa said. “Is this the way the government is tackling pollution?”</p>
      <p>Earlier, informing the House about the steps taken by the government to tackle the issue, Javadekar said a high-level task force was set up under the chairmanship of the principal secretary to the Prime Minister in November 2017, which is closely monitoring the implementation of measures to manage air pollution in Delhi-NCR.</p>
      <p>On vehicular emissions, he said BS VI norms would be applicable from April 1, 2020, and this would lead to 80 per cent reduction in particulate matter emissions.</p>
      <p>To prevent stubble burning, a new central sector scheme on promotion of agricultural mechanisation for in-situ management of crop residue in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is being implemented, he said.</p>
      <p>Kumari Selja of the Congress said farmers alone should not be held responsible and the government should provide them technologies to address the crop residue problem.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> MP Vijay Goel alleged that the Delhi government has done nothing to combat pollution. Sanjay Singh of the AAP said even Union Minister Javadekar has admitted in his report that the pollution in Delhi has reduced in the last two years.</p>
