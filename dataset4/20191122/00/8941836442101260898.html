      <p>SAN DIEGO (AP) - A man suspected of shooting three employees at a fast-food restaurant in San Diego, killing one, has been arrested in Tennessee.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Marshals Service says Albert Blake was taken into custody Friday in Memphis.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear whether he has an attorney. He’s facing extradition to San Diego.</p>
      <p>Blake was sought in connection with the Nov. 6 attack at a Church’s Chicken in the Otay Mesa neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Police say the gunman got into an argument with workers after trying to pay for food with a counterfeit $100 bill.</p>
