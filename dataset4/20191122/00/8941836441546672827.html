      <p>ST. LOUIS (AP) - A St. Louis woman whose diary entry detailed dumping a body along a highway has been sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
      <p>A judge on Friday sentenced 39-year-old Joni Janis. She pleaded guilty in September to abandonment of a corpse and a drug charge.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 26-year-old Kierstin Whitcher of Waterloo, Illinois, died in 2017 of a diabetes complication. Police found Janis’ diary in which she wrote that a male tenant of an apartment in her home left behind the woman, saying she was in a coma.</p>
      <p>Janis explained in her diary that when she realized the woman was dead, she put the body in a car, which was left alongside the highway with the woman inside.</p>
