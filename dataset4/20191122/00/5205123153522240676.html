      <p>The driver of the lorry, 25-year-old Mo Robinson from Co. Armagh, was arrested at the scene. It was alleged that Robinson alerted authorities himself once he made the grizzly discovery of what had happened in his container.</p>
      <p>He was later charged on 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. and appeared before a Magistrate'a Court in Chelmsford, Essex in late October.</p>
      <p>He's due to appear at the Old Bailey in London on Monday.</p>

      <p>Essex Police is seeking the extradition of Eamonn Harrison, 22, a truck driver from Mayobridge, who is being held in the Republic of Ireland, according to the <i><b>BBC</b></i>.</p>
      <p>He appeared at Dublin's Central Criminal Court on Thursday after he was arrested on a European arrest warrant in respect of 39 counts of manslaughter, one count of a human trafficking offence and one count of assisting unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the UK authorities say Mr Harrison drove the truck with the refrigerated container to Zeebrugge in Belgium before it was collected in Essex by Craigavon driver Maurice Robinson.</p>
