      <p>The Chartered Institute of Bankers, Ghana (CIB), the professional body for Banking education in the country, has once again commenced their annual celebrations which usually happen in November but this time around starting with a health walk.<br/><br/>The institute embarked on an about two hours’ walk around their vicinity after which there was a workout session that included activities such as aerobics, and sporting games like football, volley ball and table tennis, to keep fit and remain healthy for the other activities that will mark the celebration.<br/><br/>The President of CIB, Reverend Patricia Sappor, quoting the popular adage ‘a healthy mind lives in a healthy body,” indicated that the health walk was necessary for the bankers to burn some fats and calories in their body in order to maintain good healthy<br/><br/>“Exercising makes a person healthy and for most of our members they are always in their offices working busily so we dedicated this day for them to be able to exercise their body. It also helps to get rid of toxins in the body, keep the mind active and also gives us the opportunity to bond and network.<br/><br/>“Most of the time we are all in our offices busily working on our banking activities to keep the banks going, but when we come together, people are relaxed for us to exercise, chat together, network and bond as an institution,” she said.<br/><br/>The annual celebration for this year is to be marked under the theme: “The Digital Age: Implications for the Growth and Sustainability of the Financial Industry."<br/><br/>Rev. Patricia, commenting on the theme for the celebration explained that banking has changed and is all about digitalisation which is all about convenience for clients, and everybody has gone digital so the motive is to create the awareness for the need for members to go digital.<br/><br/>The other activities to mark the celebration this year includes; the 10th graduation programme of the institution, the 23rd National Banking Conference, launch of Sustainable Banking Principles; Ghana, 54th Annual General Meeting (AGM), and annual bankers’ dinner, after which it will all be climaxed with a thanksgiving service early next year.<br/><br/>The CEO, CIB, Charles Ofori-Acquah, emphasised that growth and sustainability in the financial sector especially the banking industry, in the new digital age is highly important and the idea behind this year’s celebration is for chartered bankers and staff of all banks to build capacity to be able to survive in the new digital age called the fourth industrial revolution.<br/><br/>“We should not be left behind as a country and as a banking profession, and the only way to stay relevant is to sharpen our professional skills and develop all the soft skills that are needed in the new digital age, in order to be able to deliver best service to customers and give good returns to investors in the industry,” he said. <br/>On Saturday 23th November, the next activity on the celebration calendar which is the 10th graduation ceremony will be held at the institution's auditorium.</p>
