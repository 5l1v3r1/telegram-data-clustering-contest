      <p>The Department of Surgery in the College of Health Sciences at the University of Zimbabwe said no medical examinations will be held this November.</p>
      <p>In an internal memo addressed to medical students, the department’s chairperson Mr David Muchuweti said the academic environment is not conducive to mount credible examinations.</p>
      <p>He said students will be informed as and when conditions will be suitable to hold the said examinations.</p>
      <p>Mr Muchuweti said this decision followed deliberations from the departmental board, which saw it fit to halt any examinations for now.</p>
      <p>“The departmental Board of Surgery has deliberated on the issue of examinations for this year and has made the following resolutions:</p>
      <p>“The academic environment is not conducive to mount credible examinations. The department will not be offering any examinations for now.</p>
      <p>“The board will inform you as and when conditions will be suitable to hold the said examinations,” reads part of the memo.</p>
      <p>The latest decision followed concerns by the students indicating that they were not ready for examinations owing to the on-going industrial action in public health institutions, which made it difficult for them to partake their practicals in public health facilities.</p>
