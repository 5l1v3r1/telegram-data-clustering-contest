      <h1>Which Fall Books Lived Up To the Hype? A Mid-Season Sales Survey</h1>

      <p>Every fall promises readers—and, possibly, publishers—unknown riches, with a large slate of new book releases promoted heavily through <i>Publishers Weekly</i> reviews, <i>New York Times Book Review</i> covers, Oprah’s Book Club and too-many-to-count preview packages from the likes of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/books-coming-fall-2019.html"><i>New York</i></a>, <a href="https://ew.com/books/50-most-anticipated-books-2019/"><i>EW</i> </a>and <a href="https://time.com/5661400/best-books-fall-2019/"><i>Time</i></a>. So, which ones have delivered on the hype? <i>Forbes</i> picked 15 of the most hyped books and looked up the total U.S. hardcover sales so far, using data from NPD BookScan from September 10 to November 9. We chose books based on the number of reviews each received from leading publications (nine, on average) and the overall reputation of the author. New books from social science writer Malcolm Gladwell and thriller novelist John Le Carre were included, for example, even though they garnered fewer reviews. </p>

      <p>Three of fall’s most hyped books were among the top ten books with the highest U.S. hardcover sales between September 1 and November 9: <i>The Institute</i> (release date: September 10) by the world’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2018/12/11/worlds-highest-paid-authors-2018-michael-wolff/#652591af2517">third-highest-paid author</a>, Stephen King, which has sold over 300,000 copies; <i>The Testaments </i>(September 10), Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her 1985 blockbuster <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>; and Gladwell’s <i>Talking to Strangers</i> (September 10). Seven other books sold more than 25,000 copies—a threshold for “doing well,” according to Marly Rusoff, a former Houghton Mifflin executive who now runs her own literary agency. Ten of the fifteen books sold more than 20,000 copies. </p>
      <p>Rusoff and Devon Halliday, a literary agent with Susanna Lea Associates, said that in general, the market for nonfiction right now can be greater than for new fiction, as readers turn to political, issue-oriented books to explain a tumultuous moment in U.S. history. “When you got a whole country watching nothing but impeachment trials, the appetite for fiction [is satisfied by the] reality from the world we live in.” </p>
      <p>That helps explain the success of two heavily publicized releases—<i>New Yorker</i> writer Ronan Farrow’s <i>Catch and Kill</i> (released on October 15) and the <i>New York Times’</i> Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s <i>She Said </i>(September 10)—that included those reporters’ Pulitzer-winning efforts in exposing Harvey Weinstein’s history of sexual harassment in Hollywood. Farrow, who also took on his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/10/17/ronan-farrow-on-nbcs-attacks-those-shredded-trump-files-and-getting-death-threats/#cb597a430837">former bosses</a> at NBC in the book, have sold over 93,000 copies; Kantor and Twohey have sold 39,600. </p>
      <p>Rusoff says bestsellers increasingly come only from name-brand authors. Of the top ten bestselling books this fall, all were by well-known authors with the exception of breakout success <i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i>, which is still surging in sales despite hitting shelves last August. And the reputation of the author can often outweigh negative reviews—Malcolm Gladwell’s sixth book was panned by critics (<i>The Atlantic</i> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/when-malcolm-gladwell-says-nothing-at-all/597697/">claimed</a> <i>Talking to Strangers</i> argues “nothing in particular” ) but still sold over 258,000 copies. “He’s established himself as someone who is trustworthy. If it was a debut and it got terrible reviews, it would be very difficult,” Rusoff says.</p>
      <p>Great reviews and media exposure goes only so far. Saeed Jones’ <i>How We Fight for Our Lives</i> (October 8) won the Kirkus Prize for nonfiction and a stellar review from <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, in addition to scoring Jones a book publicist’s major coup—an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/06/776747102/we-re-all-struggling-writer-saeed-jones-reflects-on-identity-and-acceptance">interview </a>with Terry Gross on NPR’s <i>Fresh Air</i>. So far, it has sold a modest 5,400 copies.</p>
