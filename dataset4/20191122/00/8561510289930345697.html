      <h1>MIT Deepfake Shows Nixon Sadly Saying the Moon Astronauts Died</h1>

      <h3>Rewriting History</h3>
      <p>In the event that Apollo 11 — the NASA mission that sent Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the surface of the Moon — failed, President Nixon had a speech written and <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/presidential-libraries/events/centennials/nixon/images/exhibit/rn100-6-1-2.pdf">ready to go</a>.</p>
      <p>Because the mission succeeded, Nixon never delivered the speech, but MIT engineers used deepfake technology to create a news broadcast in which a digitally-reconstructed Nixon delivers the bad news, <i><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/11/22/mit-nixon-deep-fake">WBUR News </a></i><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/11/22/mit-nixon-deep-fake">reports</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaq4sWFvnAY">deepfake</a>, which will be presented at a film festival Friday, illustrates just how easy it is to make virtual puppets deliver convincing speeches, even if they’re totally removed from history.</p>

      <h3>Behind The Scenes</h3>
      <p>Francesca Panetta, co-director of the larger film in which the deepfake appears, told <i>WBUR</i> that she had someone actually read the script while impersonating Nixon’s intonation and then used software to make the recording sound even more like Nixon’s voice. It’s not the <a href="https://futurism.com/pioneer-perfect-deepfake-six-months-away">most advanced way</a> to create deepfakes out there, but it still gets the job done.</p>
      <p>“I had one person say, ‘Oh, so you got an impersonator to impersonate Nixon,'” she told <i>WBUR</i>. “They didn’t think it was a synthetic voice. I had someone else say, ‘Oh, so Nixon actually did record this? They filmed him saying this as a contingency speech then in case it happened?’ And I was like, ‘Wow! OK — you thought they filmed this before. I guess it worked.'”</p>
