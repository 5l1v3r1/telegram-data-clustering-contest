      <p>In 2019 alone, a total of 54 incidents of animals being "ingested" by plane-engines occurred.</p>
      <p>Forty-three of those were "bird strikes" while a further 11 were reported as being hares, living in the grassy areas of the runway, according to the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).</p>
      <p>These instances are considering extremely high-risk situations which have the potential to bring down aircraft.</p>
      <p>Hares getting caught in the engine are considered even more dangerous than bird-strike, because the remains of the hares can be spread over a large area after hitting the engine, and can attract flocks of birds, creating a secondary hazard.</p>

      <p>Airport authorities have been working hard to reduce the number of hares on the runway at Dublin, using flare guns, nets and other elaborate tactics to try and prevent hares getting near the planes.</p>
      <p>The measures have certainly been working, as the number of incidents of engine ingestions has reduced from 102 in 2018.</p>
      <p>A total of 44 hares have been caught at Dublin Airport this year and have been released in Kildare and Wicklow under the supervision of a consultant approved by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the DAA said the safety of passengers is a key priority for Dublin Airport.</p>
      <p>He added: "To maintain the highest levels of safety - and to meet key regulatory requirements - all wildlife in the vicinity of the airport has to be proactively managed to minimise the risk to aviation."</p>
