      <p>South American soccer’s governing body CONMEBOL will launch an official eSports tournament as part of a new licensing agreement with video game publisher EA Sports.The Copa Libertadores, the continent's premier soccer tournament, and secondary competition the Copa Sudamericana will be playable in <i>FIFA 20</i> from March 2020.</p>
      <p>A free update will be rolled out in for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, bringing clubs from Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay and other South American nations into the game. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia are already included, but the inclusion of more players and teams in modes like ‘FIFA Ultimate Team’ could increase the series’ traction in South America.</p>

      </p>
      <p>EA Sports’ rival Konami had been a partner of CONMEBOL for several years, with tournaments official licensed in <i>Pro Evolution Soccer (PES)</i>. Up until 2019, the Japanese publisher had also held the license for UEFA club competitions but also lost that to EA Sports. </p>
      <p>Konami still retains the UEFA international license and will launch an official eSports tournament for the European Championships in 2020 – eEuro 2020.</p>
      <p>However, CONMEBOL will hope the more popular <i>FIFA </i>series will provide exposure to an international audience and also form the basis for a successful eSports competition. According to EA Sports, there were 45 million unique players during its 2019 financial year, while the series has shifted 260 million copies since it launched in 1993. More than 10 million copies of <i>FIFA 20 </i>have been sold since it was released in September.</p>

      <p>“This alliance with EA, one of the largest video game companies, is a major step forward for the worldwide dissemination and image of South American football,” said CONMEBOL Commercial Director, Juan Emilio Roa. “Thanks to this agreement, our tournaments, clubs and players will have greater reach and recognition among the football fans who will have a whole new way to follow their heroes.”</p>
      <p>Players of any level will be able to compete in qualifiers for the eLibertadores, with the eight best players from both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One invited to compete in the grand final, held in March 2020. A prize of $100,000 is on offer, as well as FIFA Global Series Points that can help qualification for world tournaments.</p>
      <p>“The addition of the prestigious CONMEBOL Libertadores to our FIFA 20 Global Series ecosystem strengthens our connection to the global fandom of football and will accelerate the growth of esports in new parts of the world,” said Brent Koning, FIFA Competitive Gaming Commissioner. “We aim to offer the most inclusive esports competition in the world and are eager to welcome South American-based players and aspiring superstars to join the tens of millions already competing in FIFA.”</p>
      <p>Deloitte predicts that by 2020, the global eSports market will generate $1.5 billion in annual revenues thanks to income from sponsorship and advertising. It also believes 600 million people will be regarded as eSports fans.</p>
