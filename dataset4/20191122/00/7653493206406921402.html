      <h1>Vodafone Team Up With Amazon Prime In Time For Christmas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Vodafone and Amazon Australia are teaming up to give customers more value with 12 months of Amazon Prime for free when they sign up or upgrade to a Red or Red Plus plan with a selected Samsung device.</p>
      <p>Valued at $59, even current Vodafone Samsung device users with a Red or Red Plus plan are eligible for the 12 months of Amazon Prime for free expedited delivery in as quick as two days and shopping benefits like Prime Day.</p>
      <p>Following the 12-months Vodafone customers can continue their Amazon Prime subscription for $6.99 a month directly through their Vodafone account for easy and secure billing.</p>
      <p>Vodafone’s Chief Commercial Officer, Ben McIntosh, said customers want more from their phone plan and expect value across more aspects of their life than ever before.</p>
      <p>‘With 12 months of Amazon Prime on us, customers can enjoy extra cash in their back pocket and peace of mind that their membership is taken care of for 12 months’.</p>
      <p>It comes as Vodafone reveals they now have a reported customer base of 5.071 million.</p>
      <p>Eligible Samsung handsets for Vodafone’s Amazon Prime Deal include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy S10</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy Note10+</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy Fold </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And on top of that, thanks to Samsung, customers will receive a bonus pair of Galaxy Buds when they upgrade to purchase the Galaxy Note10, Galaxy S10, Galaxy Tab S6 or Galaxy Watch Active2, until 25 November.</p>
