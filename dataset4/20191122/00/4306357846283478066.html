      <h3>Jose Mourinho has told Tottenham Hotspur fans that he is expecting to see the club climb the Premier League table before the season is out.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho is currently getting used to life at the north London club after having been brought in as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Spurs opted to sack Pochettino and his coaching staff on Tuesday night after a poor start to the season left the north London side languishing in 14th place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been tasked with steering the Lilywhites back up the Premier League table as they look to try and at least break back into the top four.</p>
      <p>First up for Mourinho and his Spurs team is a London derby clash against West Ham United at the London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho has told Spurs fans that he will take it game by game as the Lilywhites look to break back into the top four.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11865830/jose-mourinho-tottenham-head-coach-promises-passion-and-insists-he-could-not-be-happier">Sky Sports</a>, Mourinho said: “In relation to the Premier League, I think we know where we are and we know that we don’t belong there.</p>
      <p>“We should just play match after match, the next match we want to win and that’s the same about the next, and the next, and the next until the last.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the season we will see where we are but I know that we are going to be in a different position than we are now.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to the challenge, to the responsibility to bring happiness to everyone that loves the club.”</p>
      <p>Spurs will then return to Champions League action on Tuesday night when they host Olympiakos in the group stage at their home ground.</p>
      <p>After that, they will host Bournemouth in the Premier League.</p>
