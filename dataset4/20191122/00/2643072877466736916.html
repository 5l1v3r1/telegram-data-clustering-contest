      <p>A video has emerged on the social media, showing the moment Bayelsa Governor-Elect, David Lyon, goofed repeatedly while delivering a speech.</p>
      <p>Naija News recalls that Lyon who contested the Bayelsa governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Nigeria’s ruling party on Saturday, November 16, was declared winner of the Bayelsa election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
      <p>Lyon defeated Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, to emerge Bayelsa Governor-Elect.</p>
      <p>Apparently excited by the victory, Lyon visited Aso Rock, Nigeria’s Presidential Villa on Tuesday, to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for supporting him during the campaign.</p>
      <p>After meeting with the President, Lyon addressed State House Correspondents where he “murdered” English while delivering his speech.</p>
      <p>His words: “Today is one of my great day of my life. The great people of Bayelsans have spoken their mind by taking time to vote for our great party APC.</p>
      <p>“It’s indeed a welcome development because in our own campaigns, we give to them, when being elected and swear in, we give to them security and development; it is our key agendas,” he said in sputtering grammar.</p>
      <p>”And with support of Bayelsans, they have made it possible. Today, on behalf of my APC leaders, I promise Bayelsans we will serve them, not Bayelsans to serve us.</p>
      <p>“We also to promise we will respect leadership. Respect leadership is key to us. And today, their vote has been counted and the people of Bayelsa will be respected.</p>
      <p>“I’m sincerely grateful to our father the president of this country, for his fatherly advice this afternoon. As one of his son in APC, I thank you very much we Bayelsans will not disappoint APC.”</p>
