      <h1>Any Request From President Buhari, Good For Nigeria – Lawan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/ahmad-lawan/"><u><b>Ahmad Lawan</b></u></a>, the Senate President, on Thursday, claimed that any request placed forward by <b>President Muhammadu Buhari</b> is beneficial to Nigerians and such should be acted on expeditiously.</p>
      <p>The President of the Senate stated this during a courtesy visit by the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/itse-sagay/"><u><b>Itse Sagay</b></u></a>, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Sagay charged the Senate to pass the Special Criminal Court and other similar bills, he claimed that such a bill will help fight against anti-corruption and ensure that the fight was successfully won with speed and energy.</p>
      <p>He pleaded with the Senate to consider the confirmation of the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu.</p>
      <p>The Senate President while responding to the plea said, <i>“This is a new Senate. Going by our rules and I believe that goes for the House of Reps too, any issue that was not concluded in the last National Assembly, will have to start all over again.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“So, as far as we are concerned, those bills will have to come again and start to go through the process from the very beginning.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We are ready. In fact, we are in haste if those bills are ready for us to start working on them.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He claimed that there was no request before the upper chamber for the confirmation of Magu as EFCC chairman.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“When such request comes, the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.”</i>
