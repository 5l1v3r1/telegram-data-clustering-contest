      <p>The Petroleum Commission has urged Ghanaians to bring their job application documents for possible employment considerations if opportunity opens in the petroleum upstream sector.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the questions and answers session on the second day of the ongoing local content conference and exhibition in Takoradi, the acting Chief Executive Officer of the Petroleum Commission Egbert Fabille Jnr. revealed that the commission meticulously scrutinized job permits for expatriates.</p>
      <p>“What we have done at the commission is that we have created a database because of what we do for the Ghana Immigration Service, and I am asking Ghanaians to bring us their qualifications and their requisite for us to put it in our database so that when work permit application comes, I will ask my localization manager to go into the database to check if we have any Ghanaian who has the same qualification and competencies like the expatriates.</p>
      <p>“And if we get any, we don’t approve of the working permit and ensure that the said company employs the said Ghanaian and so Ghanaians are getting jobs and are participating fully in the upstream sector so please support the commission because the commission is ensuring that the international oil companies and their service providers employ locally, we will ensure that they train our people as well,” he told the participants who were excited about the call.</p>
      <p>He stated that through the intervention of the Petroleum Commission, some twenty students have completed training in Shielded Material Arc Wedding at Danest Engineering in Takoradi to serve industry needs which were hitherto undertaken outside the country.</p>
      <p>Thousands of upstream industry players, both local and international have gathered in Takoradi over the past three days to strategise. The engagement is expected to end Friday, November 22nd, 2019</p>
