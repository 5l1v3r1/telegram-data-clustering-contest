      <h1>Mourinho's arrival could reactivate some star's renewals!</h1>

        <b>Jose Mourinho's arrival has generated an earthquake in Tottenham. The signing of the Portuguese to manage the team may have caused footballers such as Eriksen, Alderweireld and Vertonghen to change their minds and now renew their contracts with the team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite all the controversy he has caused, if there is one thing <b>Mourinho</b> guarantees in his teams, it is<b> character and competitivity,</b> something which footballers often like. </p>
      <p><b>The Portuguese coach has unleashed madness </b>after his signing for<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc"> Tottenham</a> and his arrival could<b> have an affect on the sporting level beyond imagination. </b></p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b>'s presence as the coach made a number of players reluctant to <b>continue in the ranks</b> of the London team, but the hiring of the Portuguese has<b> totally changed the situation.</b></p>
