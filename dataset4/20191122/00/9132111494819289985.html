      <p>Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Ghana have expressed worry over what they say is an attempt to undermine the work of the Auditor-General, Daniel Domelevo, by some state agencies.</p>
      <p>A release by CSOs said even though Mr Dormelevo was vigorously pursuing his constitutionally-mandated functions and acting without fear or favour in auditing and surcharging a number of state institutions he has courted the anger of some ruling party supporters.</p>
      <p>The CSOs said they believed the purported procurement procedural challenge for which the Mr Dormelevo was currently being harassed could have been cured but various state agencies decided to teach the Auditor General a lesson.</p>
      <p>The CSOs have, therefore, given reasons for which they believe the Auditor-General is being undermined.</p>
      <p>Reasons for which CSOs believe the Auditor-General’s work is being undermined include:</p>
      <p>An on-going feud between the Audit Service Board and the Auditor General.</p>
      <p>The non-approval of the concurrent application for ratification by PPA despite establishing that there was value for money and found no malfeasance or dissipation of public money by the Auditor-General.</p>
      <p>EOCO’s decision to still investigate the matter in the first place, after the PPA has established value for money, and had not found any malfeasance or dissipation of public money.</p>
      <p>The Alliance for Accountable Governance (AFAG), an NPP-affiliated pressure group calling for the Attorney General to take action on the PPA report, as well as calling for the removal of the Auditor General.</p>
