      <p>RUNNING SPRINGS, Calif. (KABC) -- Many in the mountain regions of the Southland woke up to a winter wonderland Thursday morning after a heavy snowstorm moved into the area overnight.<br/><br/>A winter storm warning was downgraded to a winter weather advisory, which is set to expire at 7 p.m. for mountain communities at elevations higher than 5,000 feet.<br/><br/>Running Springs, which is just over 6,000 feet, saw several inches of fresh powder. Snowplows worked overnight to clear roadways in Lake Arrowhead. Mount Pinos saw the most snow, with 8 to 16 inches, according to the National Weather Service.<br/><br/>Authorities established tire-chain checkpoints on roads leading to mountain areas, where freezing temperatures are creating slick, treacherous driving conditions.<br/><br/>"You see the blacktop and you think, 'Oh, I don't need chains,'" chain installer Joel Sunderland said. "You could go up 3/4 of a mile and the road could just be iced up. There's a reason why they're out here, making chain control."<br/><br/>Mountain High Resort is expected to begin its ski season this weekend. Announcements from resorts in the Big Bear area are forthcoming.</p>
