      <p>Hope springs from the lavish layers of quick, thick, colorful oil brushstrokes, circles embodying a deep regard for eternal life that’s interconnected with a passion for Native American culture and an appreciation of textiles.The subconscious mind takes over as the viewer carefully examines the intricacy of Richard Pousette-Dart’s <i>Untitled</i> (1944), a resplendent example of the pioneering Abstract Expressionist master’s exploration of spirituality, humanity, and nature.</p>
      <p>One surrenders to become fully engaged with this and other stunning works on view through January 25, 2020, at <a href="https://www.michaelrosenfeldart.com/">Michael Rosenfeld Gallery</a> in a sublime celebration of the modernist painters and sculptors who revolutionized New York’s art world in the early 1940s.</p>
      <p>We’re transported back to this critical moment in art history, as Charles Alston, William Baziotes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natashagural/2019/08/08/more-than-30-acclaimed-collages-by-legendary-black-artist-romare-bearden-reunited-for-first-time-in-nearly-40-years/">Romare Bearden</a>, Harold Cousins, Dorothy Dehner, Jimmy Ernst, Claire Falkenstein, Herbert Ferber, Michael Goldberg, Arshile Gorky, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Richard Hunt, Gerome Kamrowski, Lee Krasner, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natashagural/2019/05/02/frieze-new-york-takes-us-back-to-gritty-1970s-new-york-and-on-a-diverse-voyage-of-1000-plus-artists/">Norman Lewis</a>, Seymour Lipton, Boris Margo, Roberto Matta, Gordon Onslow Ford, Alfonso Ossorio, Jackson Pollock, Pousette-Dart, Theodore Roszak, Mark Rothko, Charles Seliger, Janet Sobel, Theodoros Stamos, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Laurence Vail, and Hale Woodruff emerge again to exemplify the glory and range of Abstract Expressionism.</p>
      <p>No master is cast in the shadows, as <i>Globalism Pops BACK Into View: The Rise of Abstract Expressionism</i>, the brainchild of art historian Barbara Cavaliere, fires back at disparaging articles by stodgy critic Edward Alden Jewell published in 1943 by <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
      <p>Jewell’s verbose <i>'GLOBALISM' POPS INTO VIEW; Puzzling Pictures in the Show by the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors Exemplify the Artists' Approach</i>, published on June 13, 1943, took aim the Third Annual Exhibition of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors, specifically works by Gottlieb and Rothko.</p>
      <p>In his first review of the Federation’s third exhibition at Wildenstein Gallery in New York from June 2 1943, to June 26, 1943, Jewell wrote: "You will have to make of Marcus Rothko's [Mark Rothko's] <i>The Syrian Bull</i> what you can: nor is this department prepared to shed the slightest enlightenment when it comes to Adolph Gottlieb's <i>Rape of Persephone</i>. John Graham continues his bizarre experimentation with paint, giving us this time a device called just<i> Painting</i>, which might perhaps derive in some queer sort of way from Lautrec, though it also might perhaps not. One can hardly say."</p>
      <p>He didn’t stop there, igniting a letter signed by Gottlieb and Rothko, written with help from artist Barnett Newman. "WE do not intend to defend our pictures. The make their own defense,” the letter stated.</p>
      <p>Those groundbreaking “pictures” and the Federation’s proclamation to “condemn artistic nationalism which negates the world tradition of art at the base of modern art movements” are timely amid today’s socio-political turmoil.</p>
      <p>“Abstract expressionism of the 1940s was my entry point into American art and remains a personal passion of mine,” said Michael Rosenfeld. “I am grateful to Barbara Cavaliere for sharing her expertise and insight into this integral period in the narrative of Abstract Expressionism.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Upon entry to the gallery, we’re greeted by Lewis’s <i>Multitudes</i> (1946), a highlight of the artist’s 1949 solo exhibition at Willard Gallery. Conveying a passion for jazz music with lyrical fine lines, the oil painting is a trailblazing work by the lone African-American Abstract Expressionist of the time. Overlooked and under-appreciated for decades, Lewis shifted his focus from figurative painting and social realism to depict his discontent with post-World War II America.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Surrealism bleeds into abstraction with Onslow Ford’s <i>Untitled</i> (1945), painted during his time in Erongaricuaro, a remote Mexican village populated by the Purépecha Indians and located on the shores of Lake Patzcuaro. British-born Onslow Ford and his American writer-wife Jacqueline Johnson spent six years immersed in the native lifestyle and ceremonies.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Matta’s <i>Cycle Les 120 Journées de Sodoma et Gomorra</i> (circa 1943-1945) is a pivotal work for the Chilean artist, as he moved from drawing to his signature oil painting while emigrating to the United States. The bold lines of the triptych accentuate the distress the figures on a featureless background.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The diversity of sculpture is well represented, with works like Vail’s delightful <i>Out of My Window</i> (circa 1945), a mixed media assemblage on bottle. Known as the King of Bohemia, the Parisian-born writer-artist husband of Peggy Guggenheim began creating collages on bottles after he exhibited two paintings in a collage show at Guggenheim’s London gallery in 1938.</p>
      <p>Guggenheim’s Art of This Century, the Betty Parsons Gallery, and others, along with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natashagural/2019/10/10/the-museum-of-modern-arts-sensational-450-million-expansion-reimagines-recent-art-history/">Museum of Modern Art</a>, hosted exhibitions that gave rise to the Abstract Expressionism in 1940s New York.</p>
