      <h1>Manchester City vs Chelsea: 4 Key Facts &amp; Stats to Impress Your Mates Ahead of Premier League Clash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15403279" target="_blank">Daniel O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>​Manchester City host Chelsea in the Premier League, as the home side look to bounce back after losing ground on Liverpool.</p>
      <p>City, who were beaten by rivals Liverpool 3-1 last time out, will be looking to keep close the gap to the top, which has extended to nine points. The Citizens have failed to regain their end-of-season form from the last campaign, and are struggling to mount a title defence.</p>
      <p>Chelsea, on the other hand, have leapfrogged their opponents and sit in third place. A win in Manchester could see them rise to second, and four points ahead of champions City. They have also won six Premier League games in a row, so confidence is high.</p>
      <p>Here are some key facts that will impress your mates ahead of this crucial fixture in the top four of the Premier League.</p>

      <h3>The Key</h3>

      <p>​Sergio Aguero has been a thorn in the side of Chelsea since his move to England in 2011. He has scored ten goals against the Blues, more than any other player in the history of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Argentine netted a hat-trick in this fixture last season as City smashed Chelsea 6-0, their biggest loss in the competition. Aguero has scored eight in his last six against the away side, but a new-look Chelsea will put up a stronger fight than they did at the Etihad last season.</p>

      <p>For the first time in their history, Chelsea could win eight away games in a row in all competitions. This will not be an easy feat at the Etihad, as City look to bounce back from disappointment.</p>
      <p>Although Chelsea have been in fine form away from home, they have lost three of their last four trips to Manchester, but seem a different side. They have not won at City since 2016, where they went on to win the league.</p>

      <h3>A Side in Disarray?</h3>

      <p>​City are currently in fourth place, with Liverpool, Leicester and opponents Chelsea all higher. Who would have thought that at the start of the season?</p>
      <p>They have already lost three games this season, just one fewer than in all of last term, and one more than their centurion season. With Liverpool improving every game, Leicester and Chelsea looking the real deal, and Jose Mourinho's appointment at Tottenham, Manchester City's reign of dominance could be over.</p>

      <h3>High Scorers</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Expect a high scoring game, as both sides have a capability of exploding into life.</p>
      <p>Manchester City have scored more home goals than any other side (19) this season, but Chelsea have scored the most goals on the road (18). With Tammy Abraham on ten Premier League goals, and Aguero on nine, both strikers have the capability to win the game for their side.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have scored at least two in each of their previous five away matches, showing that they are not only dangerous at Stamford Bridge, but bring goals wherever they go.</p>
