      <h1>Coldplay’s Official Top 20 biggest songs on the UK's Official Chart</h1>
      <h2>They've had plenty of big ones, but these are officially the biggest of the lot...</h2>

      <p>It's almost 20 years since Coldplay's first Official Chart hit – Shiver, back in March 2000 – and the band are showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.</p>
      <p>The band's eighth studio album, Everyday Life, is out now, and in with a pretty good chance of being their eighth Number 1 album (<a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-acts-with-an-unbroken-career-streak-of-number-1-studio-albums__15492/">ALL their studio albums have peaked at Number 1</a>), but Coldplay aren't just an albums act – they're still managing to rack up hit singles.</p>
      <p>They’ve scored 24 Top 40 hits, including 18 Top 10s in the process, two of which were chart-toppers. <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/7620/coldplay/">See where all of Coldplay's singles and albums have charted</a>. But which of their big ones come out on top when sales and streams are combined? </p>
      <p>To mark Coldplay's return, we crunched the numbers and now count down their biggest songs in the UK, based on physical and digital sales, and streams. Before the full Top 20, a few highlights:</p>
      <h3>Yellow</h3>
      <p>This is where it all really began, with their very first Top 10 in 2000. Coldplay’s breakthrough hit went straight in at Number 4 and was taken from their debut album Parachutes, which has sold 2.6 million copies. Yellow has shifted 1.24m across all formats, being their biggest seller on physical format, with 170,000 copies sold. It's also done 419,000 downloads and 65 million streams – not a bad performance in the digital era considering it came out in 2000.</p>

      <h3>In My Place</h3>
      <p>The lead single from the band's much-anticipated second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, In My Place brought Coldplay their then-highest chart peak, going straight in at Number 2 in August 2002 (blocked from the top spot by former Pop Idol contestant Darius, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4jg-Yv1XA">Colourblind</a>). Perhaps surprisingly, despite being their second-biggest selling song on physical format, with 101,000 copies sold, In My Place hasn't really found longevity in the digital era. Its 99,000 downloads and 12.3 million streams see it land in 19th slot on Coldplay's all-time rundown.</p>

      <h3>Fix You</h3>
      <p>One of the band’s signature ballads, Fix You was written by front-man Chris Martin for his then-wife Gwyneth Paltrow following her father's death. Their ‘conscious uncoupling’ would follow nine years later, but the song is still a huge crowd-pleaser - it peaked at Number 4 and has achieved 1.24 million combined sales.</p>
      <h3>Viva La Vida</h3>
      <p>The band’s first Number 1 was a long time coming – after nine Top 10s, the guys were definitely due a chart-topper. The title track from the band’s fourth studio album Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends is their second biggest song of all time, with combined sales of 1.64 million, from 888,000 downloads and 77 million streams. <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20080628/7501">See the full Top 100 from the week Viva La Vida was Number 1.</a></p>

      <h3>Paradise</h3>
      <p>Paradise certainly took its time to become the group’s second chart-topper, it finally reached Number 1 on its tenth week in the chart, knocking off Military Wives and Gareth Malone's Wherever You Are to be the first Number 1 of 2012.</p>
      <p>Paradise has sold over one million downloads (<a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-best-selling-singles-of-all-time-on-the-official-uk-chart__21298/">Coldplay's only million seller</a>) and has been streamed 47 million times.</p>
      <h3>Princess Of China</h3>
      <p>Rihanna loves  collab, and this perhaps unlikely one with Coldplay went Top 5 in 2012. Both performed the track at closing ceremony of that year's Paralympic Games in London, helping it reach Number 4. It's combined sales stand at 852,000. <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/rihanna-s-official-top-40-biggest-selling-singles__10975/">See Rihanna's Official Top 40 best selling singles</a></p>
      <h3>Hymn for the Weekend</h3>
      <p>Speaking of collaborators, there's a very special guest making an uncredited appearance here – Beyoncé. This euphoric tribute to going out and getting off your head was a huge hit in early 2016, spending seven months in the Top 40. it has the second biggest streaming tally of any Coldplay song, with 120 million plays, and also managed 300,000 downloads to land as their fourth biggest song in the UK, with combined sales of 1.49m.</p>
      <h3>Something Just Like This</h3>
      <p>Given Coldplay are a band in constant evolution and not afraid to try new musical style, it's fitting that their biggest track of all time is this poppy collaboration with American duo The Chainsmokers.</p>
      <p>Scoring 140 million audio streams and an impressive 313,000 downloads, Something Just Like This has a combined sales tally of 1.7m. Following a performance at the 2017 BRIT Awards, the song shit up the Official Singles Chart to peak at Number 2. It's the most streamed song on video too.</p>
