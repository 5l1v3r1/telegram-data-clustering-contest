        <b>The English press has recently linked the Finnish midfielder to several Premier League clubs, an interest that Steven Gerrard made sure to deny at a press conference.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rangers coach <b>Steven Gerrard did</b> not hesitate to deny any links at a press conference, after rumours about the departure of <b>Glen Kamara</b> started to flow.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old Finnish international midfielder has been linked in recent hours with a <b>number of English teams</b> who would be willing to bid for his signing next January.</p>

      <p>But Gerrard flatly denied this supposed Premier League interest in his player, a Kamara who has already <b>played 20 official games this year</b>, scoring a goal on one occasion.</p>
      <p>This is Kamara's second season at Rangers, where he <b>landed in the middle of last season from Dundee</b> and with whom he has a contract until June 2023.</p>
