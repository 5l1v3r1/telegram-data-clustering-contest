      <h1>Talking Horses: what would a Labour win mean for the gambling industry?</h1>

        <i>Labour have followed the Lib Dems in pledging stronger regulation, but what might ‘a Gambling Act for the digital age’ actually look like?</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour party and the Liberal Democrats have published their manifestos for next month’s general election over the last two days. While they are understandably keen to differentiate their offers to the British public wherever possible, gambling is one area where both parties appear to be in full agreement on the need for stronger regulation.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems are promising to “introduce a compulsory levy on gambling companies to fund research, education and treatment of problem gambling”. The party also wants to ban the use of credit cards for gambling, “restrict gambling advertising” and “establish a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling">Gambling</a> Ombudsman.”</p>
      <p>Labour are also proposing a levy to tackle problem gambling and a “curb” on gambling advertising in sports, and promises to introduce “a new Gambling Act fit for the digital age”. Its wording is vague, but the aims of the new Act will, it seems, include “establishing gambling limits” and “mechanisms for consumer compensations”.</p>
      <p>An email to Labour’s press office on Thursday afternoon, seeking some clarity on what this might actually mean, has yet to receive a reply at time of writing.</p>
      <p>Should Labour eventually be in a position to legislate on gambling, it will, of course, be seeking to tighten up the regulation of the same industry which it deregulated so thoroughly last time around in 2005. That was the Gambling Act, which legitimised fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in betting shops. The legislation also failed to anticipate that the future of gambling was online, where gamblers can leave themselves at the mercy of an operator simply by clicking a box to agree to their terms.</p>
      <p>So, what might be included in the next Gambling Act if or when it appears? Tom Watson, Labour’s former deputy leader, is stepping down as an MP at this election. He had long been one of the party’s key thinkers on gambling issues before his abrupt departure from politics, and he floated a lot of possibilities in a speech in February.</p>
      <p>A long-overdue ban on gambling with credit cards is already a near-certainty, whoever wins the election (how did anyone ever think it was a good idea in the first place?). But Watson’s speech proposed going much further, introducing “a culture of limits” on online gambling, with “thresholds placed on the spend, stake and speed” that will give safeguards to customers.</p>
      <p>Much of this would presumably focus more on gaming (roulette, slots and other fixed-margin products) than betting on sport and racing. But what Watson described as a “cat-and-mouse game of industry excess and regulatory chasing” has all too often involved bookmakers too.</p>
      <p>The era of VIP accounts – offering incentives to high-rolling losers to keep them betting – could well be drawing to a close, while the use of free bets and grossly distorted odds to attract new customers is another ubiquitous practice that needs close scrutiny.</p>
      <p>From horse racing’s point of view, there could be some concern that while Watson was aware that the sport is uniquely intertwined with betting, whoever picks up the baton on gambling following his exit may not be similarly disposed.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the BHA said on Thursday that “in its September 2018 gambling review, Labour outlined that it would provide exemptions for horse racing, recognising its intrinsic and traditional relationship with betting”, adding that “there is nothing in today’s manifesto which evolves that position.”</p>
      <p>And what of the stake restrictions for winning punters, on racing in particular, that are also standard practice among modern bookies? Watson was no doubt concerned for problem gamblers when he said that “company profits have come before consumer protection for far too long”.</p>
      <p>However, his claim that Labour would put “consumer protection at the centre of the online gambling industry” could equally apply to those whose bets are routinely refused or restricted to pennies. Might the next Gambling Act finally ensure that bookies are no longer free to discriminate against punters smart enough to beat them?</p>
      <p>The latest election betting suggests that neither party will get the chance to put their plans into action. A Conservative majority was a shade of odds-against on Betfair at the start of the campaign, but the price has since contracted to around 1.56 (about 4-7). A hung parliament – and with it, the possibility of a minority or coalition government – is a 2-1 chance.</p>
      <p>In that situation, tighter regulation on gambling could well be one of the few proposals which a substantial majority of MPs might support. That Gambling Act for the digital age could yet prove to be more immediate than many might suppose.</p>
      <h3>Friday’s best bets, by Chris Cook</h3>
      <p>The nap, Impulsive Star, has become a non-runner because of a bad scope. In his absence, <b>Good Man Pat (3.15)</b> is interesting at 8-1 for Ascot’s staying handicap chase, the day’s most interesting contest.</p>
      <p>His jumping let him down at times in his novice season but he was kept to two and a half miles and was possibly having to go a stride quicker than he was really comfortable with. Today’s three miles looks more his trip and he’s on a handy rating when things fall right. He comes from the Greatwood-winning yard of Alan King.</p>
      <p>In the following handicap hurdle, <b>Oakley (3.45) </b>should be sharper for his reappearance run behind a well-treated winner. This is just his third handicap and he represents the team of Philip Hobbs and Ben Jones which is three from six this season.</p>
      <p>The opening novice chase features two Nicky Henderson runners out of a field of four, making it a tricky proposition for punters. But the favourite is Birchdale, who is surely going to need further than today’s trip. <b>Angel’s Breath (1.00) </b>should have the legs of him at 9-4.</p>
      <p>Pick of the other cards could be <b>Miss Zip (2.50)</b>, making her chase debut at Ffos Las. Four runs over hurdles have got this ex-pointer onto an attractive mark and Evan Williams’s charge is 8-1.</p>
