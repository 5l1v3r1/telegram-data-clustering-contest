      <p>The founder and leader of Glorious Word Power Ministry International, Rev Isaac Owusu Bempah is likely to vote ‘Yes’ in the impending December referendum.</p>
      <p>The controversial man of God in an interview with NEAT FM’s morning show ‘Ghana Montie’ noted that government's stance on the referendum is what must be preached to the public .</p>
      <p>He was unhappy with the NDC’s sudden 'U-turn' on the referendum considering the fact that they had all this while been cooperating constructively with the government and other stakeholders to campaign for a 'Yes' vote.</p>
      <p>“I was informed that the NDC agreed to vote for ‘Yes’. I don’t know why they have changed their mind,” he said.</p>
