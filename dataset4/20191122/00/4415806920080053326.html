      <p>Actor and director Edward Norton has told how he stepped in to save Leonardo DiCaprio after the Hollywood star ran out of air during a diving expedition.</p>
      <p>The pair were nearing the end of a trip with marine biologist Sylvia Earle in the Galapagos Islands when DiCaprio dived back into the water to chase after a group of rays.</p>
      <p>Norton, who is an experienced diver, realised DiCaprio did not have enough oxygen to complete the dive and followed him.</p>
      <blockquote>I thought to myself, he’s chasing these things, he’s going to run out of air - and he did</blockquote>
      <p>Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show, Norton decided to set the record straight, saying there was “some truth to this story”.</p>
      <p>“It has been pumped up a bit more than it deserves,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We were in the Galapagos Islands. We were scuba diving with Sylvia Earle, the great oceanographer.</p>
      <p>“I’ve known Leo a long time and he loses his mind around animals. He really has a childlike passion for them.</p>
      <p>“This flight of 100 spotted eagle rays went by below us and I saw the look on his face.</p>

      <p>“I saw him charging off with this camera that he had and I have been diving since I was 16 years old. I reflectively looked at my watch and was like: ‘We’re very close to the end.’</p>
      <p>“I saw him going off and down and I knew that wasn’t a good thing so I followed him because I thought to myself, he’s chasing these things, he’s going to run out of air – and he did.”</p>
      <p>Norton appeared on the sofa with Robbie Williams, David Walliams and the stars of Charlie’s Angels.</p>
      <p>Norton also recalled acting in 2001’s crime thriller The Score alongside Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro.</p>
      <p>He said: “That’s one you do just because of the poster… Some things you do just for the story and for the experience.”</p>
      <p>The Jonathan Ross Show airs at 10.10pm on Saturday November 23 on ITV.</p>
