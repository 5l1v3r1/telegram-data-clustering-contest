        <b>Ghana forward Kevin-Prince Boateng has revealed that he will be starting his own task force in 2020 to tackle racism in football. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old claims he is sick of it, saying that clubs should be punished with a points deduction system if they can’t make their fans behave in Italian stadiums.</p>
      <p>“It’s not enough to prevent the access of part of the fans after the insults towards [Mario] Balotelli,” he told the Corriere della Sera. “I hope the public has learned something and no longer replicate certain behaviour.</p>
      <p>“We need to ban them. The clubs need to pay for their fans’ behaviour. And if necessary, punish them with a point deduction."</p>
      <p>After a speech at a UN meeting on racial discrimination in sports, Boateng is not happy with the actions carried out by the clubs.</p>
      <p>“It was an important day in my life. But after that, what has been done to stop the trend?” he added. “There’s been a task force, summarized by a series of meetings and ideas. The “No to Racism” campaign in the Champions League is not enough.</p>
      <p>“I’ll do it myself in 2020. I’m organising my task force with events involving other players.</p>
      <p>“I’m sick of it. People don’t understand how Balotelli, Boateng or [Kalidou] Koulibaly feel when they get home.</p>
      <p>“We are alone. I go crazy when I hear comments like, ‘so what, you earn €5m’. There are scars on you that you can’t erase.”</p>
