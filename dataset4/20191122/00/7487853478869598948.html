      <h1>Predicting Manchester City's Starting XI for Premier League Clash With Chelsea</h1>

      <p>​Something has to change, right? There is no feasible way that Manchester City can retain their Premier League crown this season unless they beat Chelsea, <i>right</i>?</p>
      <p>Saturday's late kickoff has become an undoubted must-win for Pep Guardiola's side having seen City fall a full nine points behind league leaders Liverpool following their 3-1 loss at Anfield last time out.</p>

      <p>That crushing defeat has, in the minds of some people, all-but handed the Reds their first Premier League title, with the rest of the season now simply a battle to secure a top-four spot. Speaking of which, ​Chelsea have firmly placed themselves in the running for. </p>
      <p>Moreover, one point and one place above the City in the table, they themselves have earned a spot in the title race.</p>
      <p>It merely adds lashings of flavour to an already tasty encounter.</p>
      <p>So, who could Guardiola pick to ensure the Blues leave the Etihad Stadium empty handed? Let's take a look.</p>

      <h3>Goalkeepers &amp; Defenders</h3>

        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fatalanta-v-manchester-city-group-c-uefa-champions-league-5dd7e4558317e2e78d000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.5585475671750182&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.46&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.181484593837535&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.022857142857142857&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=578&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=325"/>

      <p><b>Ederson (GK) </b>- Looking like being fit in time for Saturday's clash, Ederson will waltz straight back into <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​City</a>'s lineup with the Brazilian undoubtedly among the finest stoppers in world football at present. Claudio Bravo - and Kyle Walker - won't be challenging him for the number one jersey anytime soon, and his presence is imperative to City's way of playing.</p>
      <p><b>Kyle Walker (RB) </b>- Joao Cancelo has endured a frustrating start to his career in the north-west, so far finding it nigh-on impossible to dislodge <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/kyle-walker">​Walker</a> from the right-back slot. Guardiola is a big fan of the England international, with his pace and attacking prowess likely to cause either Marcos Alonso or Emerson plenty of problems at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p><b>Nicolas Otamendi (CB) </b>- One of the supposed weak links in the team, Otamendi had struggled for form this season with some costly errors that have come back to haunt him and his side already. Aymeric Laporte's injury has coincided with City's failings in the league, and the Argentine will need to step up to the plate in his absence.</p>
      <p><b>John Stones (CB) </b>- Not without blame himself, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/john-stones">​Stones</a> has endured three injury-ravaged full seasons for City, while his inconsistent form has done little to aid his cause during that time. Still, those issues aside, he remains the best City have on the ball in their injury-hit defence, with his close-range passing crucial to the way Guardiola likes to build from the back.</p>
      <p><b>Angelino (LB) </b>- For whatever reason, be it form or his tendency to lead a lavish off-field lifestyle, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/benjamin-mendy">​Benjamin Mendy</a> has fallen out of favour massively under Guardiola, with Angelino getting the nod over his French teammate in recent weeks. That is likely to continue against Chelsea on the weekend, with Guardiola placing plenty of trust in his fellow Spaniard.</p>

      <h3>Midfielders</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Fernandinho (DM) </b>- The decision to play Otamendi in defence may simply be as a means to take Fernandinho out of the backline. Even at 34-years-old, the Brazilian's role in the centre of midfield has been a pivotal element to City's <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> domination over the last two seasons, where he has a much greater effect on proceedings.</p>
      <p><b>David Silva (CM) </b>- Was left out of the starting lineup for the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> defeat, but his ball retention and ability to weave out of tight situations will make him a key player against the opposing midfield trio, and is still a reliable big game player.</p>
      <p><b>Kevin De Bruyne (CM) </b>- One of the first names on the team sheet, only in the case of injury will the Belgian ever not be placed in Guardiola's lineup. With a range of pass few other in the world can match, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/kevin-de-bruyne">​De Bruyne</a> has capabilities to carve defences open at the drop of a hat, and vision in the final third (or indeed anywhere) that stands head and shoulders above any other of the league's creators.</p>

      <h3>Forwards </h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Riyad Mahrez (RW) </b>- Would probably have lost his place in the side to <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/bernardo-silva">​Bernardo Silva</a>, but suspension will mean <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/riyad-mahrez">​Mahrez</a> is likely to get the nod ahead of him. What the Algerian can offer is the option of slotting into the midfield to outnumber the Chelsea trio, allowing for space for Walker to run in behind.</p>
      <p><b>Gabriel Jesus (ST) </b>- It would be very typical Guardiola to bench <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/sergio-aguero">​Sergio Aguero</a> for such a crunch encounter, and something suggests he may do just that after the striker's misses at Anfield. The only thing he will need to be wary of is not allowing <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/gabriel-jesus">​Jesus</a> to take penalties. He isn't very good at those.</p>
      <p><b>Raheem Sterling (LW) </b>- Alongside De Bruyne, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/raheem-sterling">​Sterling</a> is one of the first names locked down in this City side. His importance to the team is immeasurable, and his eight goal contributions this season follow on from a staggering 27 in the league last season. He will probably be the one player the Blues backline will be fearing the most on Saturday.</p>
