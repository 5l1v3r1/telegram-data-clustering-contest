      <h1>5G opportunities for startups and scaleups presented at Slush</h1>

      <p>The world’s leading two-day tech startup event for innovative collaboration is in full swing, and new start-ups and scale-ups aren’t the only ones in attendance.</p>
      <p>Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, AWS, Samsung, Nokia and other big names like Telia – a leading telephone and mobile network operator in the Nordics and Baltics – are also present, showcasing their offerings and looking for potential new partners.</p>
      <h3>How 5G benefits entrepreneurs</h3>
      <p>In an interview with Telia, we looked at how its Nokia-powered 5G solution benefits startups.</p>
      <p>In partnership with Telia, Nokia has launched FastMile 5G Gateway – a Fixed Wireless Access network – which gives users access to new and enhanced ultra-broadband services.</p>
      <p>As a result, Telia is now offering Fixed Wireless subscriptions for its users in Finland.</p>
      <p>“Basically, it’s almost like a fixed wide fibre connection – it’s a fast, really high-bandwidth connectivity solution which you can use for any type of content and it’s very easy to install. Customers can simply buy it as a service for a fixed monthly fee,” said Mika Raitola, Innovation Lead at Telia Finland, Telia Company.</p>
      <p>This not only enables it to give its home and business users a very fast connection with low latency, but also makes it much easier for startups and scale-ups to focus on the core of their business without having to worry about whether the network can handle all their devices and bandwidth demands.</p>
      <p>This is because this solution can handle many more devices within a square kilometre than previous-generation technologies and does not require a router.</p>
      <p>It also eliminates previous challenges for larger organisations or those looking to scale their business or invest a lot of money into sophisticated networking technologies.</p>
      <p>According to Raitola, FastMile 5G Gateway also allows entrepreneurs to easily move their businesses.</p>
      <p>“Entrepreneurs in the retail space can, for example, start with a pop-up store and then scale, move, and expand as needed. They will also be able to expand on their service offerings and will have more flexibility with things like audio and video. The possibilities are limitless,” concluded Raitola.</p>
