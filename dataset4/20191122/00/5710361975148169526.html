      <p>Investing.com - U.S. futures were slightly higher on Friday, after Chinese President Xi Jinping said he wants a trade deal with the U.S. but is not afraid to “fight back.”</p>
      <p>“As we always said, we don’t want to start the trade war but we are not afraid,” Xi told a U.S. business delegation in Beijing. “When necessary we will fight back but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war.”</p>
      <p>Doubts over whether a trade deal will be reached by the end of the year have risen this week. Earlier in the week, there were reports that China had invited U.S. officials to Beijing for further talks but it’s unclear if the U.S. has accepted.</p>
