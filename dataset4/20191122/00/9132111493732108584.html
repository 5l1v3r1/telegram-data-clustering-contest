      <p>Director-General of the National Road Safety Authority, Mrs May Obiri Yeboah, has revealed that 1,915 accident deaths were recorded between January and October 2019.</p>
      <p>Mrs May Obiri Yeboah, speaking at the launch of the National Road Safety Campaign for the upcoming festive season at Kaneshie Lorry Station, said provisional statistics for the month of January to October 2019, recorded a total number of 11,342 crashes resulting in 1,915 deaths.</p>
      <p>2,418 pedestrians were knocked down and 11,520 injuries were also recorded.</p>
      <p>She added that a total of 18,252 vehicles were involved.</p>
      <p>She revealed again that about 6, 951 commercial cars and 7,932 private vehicles were involved.</p>
      <p>Comparing this year’s figure to that of last year, she said 11,159 cases of accidents were recorded last year.</p>
      <p>Mrs Yeboah added that her outfit will continue to embark on sensitisation programmes to ensure that road crashes are completely reduced.</p>
      <p>She attributed the accidents to over-speeding.</p>
      <p>Director in Charge of Education at the Motor, Traffic and Transport Department of the Ghana Police Service, Alexander Obeng, speaking at the event, said over 5,000 drivers have been arrested out of which 4,200 were sent to court. And 3,288 were found guilty.</p>
      <p>He added that at least 32 drivers have been jailed for over-speeding.</p>
      <p>Mr Obeng explained further that 603 out of the 1,915 deaths involved pedestrians.</p>
      <p>He, therefore, urged pedestrians to use the pedestrian walkway instead of the road shoulders.</p>
      <p>Mr Obeng again said some drivers were also fined and the amount generated from January to October was GH¢291, 911.00.</p>
