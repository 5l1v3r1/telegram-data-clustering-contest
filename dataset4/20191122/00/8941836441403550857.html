      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Saddled with four fouls and struggling with his shot, Brandon Ingram stayed aggressive.</p>
      <p>It worked out quite well.</p>
      <p>Ingram scored 15 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and JJ <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/redick/">Redick</a> had 26 points, leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 124-121 win over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Phoenix Suns</a> on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“Just seeing what the defense was giving me. I was forcing it a little bit in the first half,” Ingram said. “Not letting the game come to me. I tried to open up the floor a little bit by passing it to my teammates for shot on the wings, then finally finding attack space and knocking down shots.”</p>
      <p>Jrue Holiday had 23 points and nine assists for the Pelicans, who earned their third straight win. E’Twaun Moore added a season-high 19 points.</p>

      <p>Ingram’s drive and strong finish at the rim while being fouled helped New Orleans open a 122-115 lead with 1:25 to play.</p>
      <p>But a technical foul, a turnover and a foul on a 3-pointer gave Phoenix a little hope.</p>
      <p>Holiday missed two free throws with 0.5 seconds to play, giving the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> a chance to tie after a quick timeout. But the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> couldn’t get a good shot up.</p>
      <p>“Anytime you can win on the road it’s a great win, but obviously we have to do much better than that,” Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. “We have to be smarter down the stretch.”</p>

        <p>Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 25 points in its third consecutive loss. Devin Booker had 19 for the short-handed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a>, who were without starting center Aron Baynes and starting point guard Ricky Rubio.</p>
        <p>The Pelicans held the lead in the fourth quarter from start to finish. Phoenix got as close as two points down at 117-115 with 2:22 remaining.</p>
        <p>Ingram then made a turnaround jumper before his big three-point play, helping New Orleans pull away again.</p>
        <p>The Pelicans made their first 10 shots of the third quarter to take an 83-76 lead, with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/redick/">Redick</a> scoring 10 points in that run. New Orleans didn’t miss a shot until the 5:34 mark, but lost the lead briefly before carrying a 95-94 advantage into the fourth.</p>
        <p>“We came out (in the third) and I think they scored 15 points in four minutes,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> coach Monty Williams said. “There’s no scheme for that, you just have to be more locked into the game.”</p>
        <p>Kenrich Williams’ layup - his only two points of the game - off a pass from Ingram put the Pelicans ahead 105-96 at the 10:18 mark of the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Oubre’s 3 at the second-quarter buzzer gave the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> their largest lead of the half at 66-59.</p>
        <p>Oubre blew kisses to the crowd after the shot. He had 17 first-half points.</p>
        <p>Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball came off the bench and had eight points and five assists in his first game since Nov. 8. Ball had been dealing with a strained groin.</p>
        <p>ARENA PROJECT UNVEILED</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> unveiled renderings and details of the planned renovation of Talking Stick Resort Arena during a pregame event at the nearby Phoenix Convention Center. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> managing partner Robert Sarver went over the numerous upgrades for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a>’ home, which opened in 1992.</p>
        <p>The $230 million project is a joint effort between the team and Phoenix city government.</p>
        <p>“Most importantly, (the project) will feature state-of-the-art improvements that will allow us to deliver a world-class guest experience to all of our great fans,” Sarver said in a statement from the team.</p>
