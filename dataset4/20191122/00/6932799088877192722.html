        <b>The Galaxy A71 appears to combine the rear camera bump design from Apple's iPhone 11 models with the display similar to the one found on the Galaxy Note 10 that has the punch-hole selfie cam placed in the upper center.

      <p>2020 is upon us and Samsung still has not released premium smartphones with bleeding edge cameras. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-5G-Smartphone-Review-A-turbocharged-S10-with-a-cutting-edge-addition.428293.0.html">Galaxy S10</a>-series and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Smartphone-Review-Optimised-SoC-promises-better-runtimes.433424.0.html">Note 10</a> featured measly 16 MP sensors when most Chinese competitors already offer <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-officially-announces-the-Mi-Note-10-with-five-cameras-and-a-108-MP-shooter.440501.0.html">108 MP</a> cameras. Not to mention that Samsung itself released <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-announces-new-64-MP-image-sensor-for-mobile-devices.420351.0.html">64</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Mi-MIX-4-to-be-first-with-Samsung-s-mega-108MP-sensor.428825.0.html">108</a> MP sensors this year, but the latter is nowhere to be found on any of its flagships. <br/><br/>Now, some premium mid-rangers from the Korean company already sport the 64 MP sensors, and this should make the 108 MP sensors flagship-exclusive, while the 48 MP sensors may become the bare minimum for the lower mid-range products. Speaking of mid-range models, Steve H.McFly aka OnLeaks got hold of some alleged renders of next year’s Samsung’s A71, and it looks like the rear camera setup designs will be heavily inspired from Apple’s products.<br/><br/>The new Galaxy A71 randers reveal a 6.7-inch display that does not appear to extend to the sides. Additionally, the selfie cam comes in punch-hole style and is placed in the upper center of the screen. As far as the rear cam setup is concerned, there should be 4 sensors plus a LED flash. The Galaxy <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-A70s.442150.0.html">A70s</a> was the first to integrate a 64 MP camera, so it would make sense to see a similar main sensor on the A71. The camera bump looks quite similar to what Apple released this year with the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Smartphone-Review-Triple-rear-facing-cameras-and-more-power-than-you-could-shake-a-stick-at.435092.0.html">iPhone 11</a> series, although it is a tad larger to accommodate more sensors.<br/><br/>Other rumored features include 8 GB of RAM, a 4,5000 mAh battery with fast charging capabilities, and possibly a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-675-SoC-Benchmarks-and-Specs.423846.0.html">Snapdragon 675 SoC</a>, although <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Details-of-the-Snapdragon-735-revealed-An-incremental-upgrade-on-the-Snapdragon-730.440159.0.html">a 700-series</a> might make more sense. The A 71 will most likely be unveiled at MWC in February next year.</p>
