        <b>SCOTTISH Labour will unveil a General Election pledge today for free school meals for all - even though Jeremy Corbyn would have no power to introduce the policy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Richard Leonard, the party’s boss in Scotland, will make the promise today as he published his own manifesto ahead of December 12.</p>

      <p>But the UK Government has no control over the Scottish education system, which is devolved.</p>
      <p>And aides admitted they could only guarantee it become reality if Scottish Labour - currently the Scottish Parliament’s third party - win the 2021 Holyrood elections.</p>
      <p>But they said the Scottish Government should use extra cash coming to Scotland via increased public spending down south for the policy.</p>
      <p>Mr Leonard said it would benefit about 700,000 children primary, secondary and special educational schools, and cost an extra £190 million per year</p>
      <p>He said: “It cannot be right that in the fifth biggest economy in the world, one in every four children in Scotland is living in poverty.</p>
      <p>"After a decade of Tory austerity and SNP complacency, it is time for real and radical change.</p>
      <p>“That is why I am proud to announce today that a UK Labour government will provide the funds for a free meal for every child 365 days a year, regardless of their social and economic backgrounds.</p>
      <p>"Children should not be put in a position where they are left behind through no fault of their own and through no fault of their family.</p>
      <p>"Scottish Labour will end the scourge of child poverty once and for all.”</p>
