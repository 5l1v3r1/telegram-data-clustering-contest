      <p>Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Six months into his new administration, rumours have started circulating that <b><a href="https://mg.co.za/article/2019-11-22-00-cabinet-reshuffle-on-the-cards">president Cyril Ramaphosa is already gearing up for a cabinet reshuffle.</a></b> According to sources speaking to the Mail &amp; Guardian, the reshuffle will ostensibly be about filling vacant positions, but in reality would be to move around political players after alliances and loyalties with the ANC have shifted.

      <ul>
        <li>The wheels of justice finally appear to be turning regarding state capture, <b><a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-11-21-asset-forfeiture-unit-deals-devastating-blow-to-regiments-capital-trio/">with the seizure of assets belonging to three businessmen at the centre of State Capture</a> </b>— Eric Wood, Niven Pillay and Litha Nyhonyha. The order also hints that the three are going to be defendants in a possible criminal case which could be launched by the NPA some time in the near future. [Daily Maverick]</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>With the City of Joburg’s future uncertain, following the resignation of mayor Herman Mashaba, the EFF is making a power move, laying down an ultimatum of sorts to the DA and ANC – <b><a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2019-11-21-give-us-joburg-and-well-give-you-tshwane-malema-lays-down-the-gauntlet-to-da-anc/">give the EFF Joburg to govern, and the party will give whoever helped them the City of Tshwane.</a></b> Following the 2016 municipal elections, the EFF emerged as the kingmaker in the province, with its voting power needed to elect leadership.

      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/economy/saa-will-not-be-paying-staff-salaries-on-time-37726458">SAA staff will not be getting their November salaries on time, as acting CEO Zuks Ramasia says that it has run out of cash.</a></b> The airline has been trying to secure R2 billion from lenders to continue operating, but has been unsuccessful – in the meantime, the week-long strike by workers has led to further losses. Unions leading the strike have deadlocked over wage increases, and government has said that no bailouts or further support will be forthcoming. [IOL]</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>South Africa’s rand firmed on Thursday, supported by a weaker dollar and the central bank’s decision to keep the repo rate unchanged, while stocks edged lower. The US dollar eased against other major currencies, with investors focused on the latest developments in a 16-month long trade dispute between the US and China. <b><a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=USD&amp;To=ZAR">On Friday the rand was at R14.68 to the dollar, R18.97 to the pound and R16.25 to the dollar</a></b>.</li>
