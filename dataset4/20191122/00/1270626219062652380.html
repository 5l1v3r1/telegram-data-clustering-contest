      <p>Measles has killed nearly 5,000 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019, after the disease spread to all the provinces in the country.</p>
      <p>Close to a quarter of a million people have been infected this year alone.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization says this is the world's largest and fastest-moving epidemic.</p>
      <p>Measles in DR Congo has now killed more than twice the number who have died of Ebola there in the last 15 months.</p>
      <p>The Congolese government and the WHO launched an emergency vaccination programme in September that aimed to inoculate more than 800,000 children.</p>
