      <p>Disney didn’t rush to capitalize on a sequel to <i>Frozen</i> (2013), instead, taking years to allow a new story to gestate; that’s why it’s such a surprise that <i>Frozen II </i>is so inferior to the original. There was a reason <i>Frozen </i>exploded into a pop culture juggernaut; it was a Disney movie that managed to empower the princess without turning her into a warrior, Elsa’s ice power a wonderful metaphor for emotional repression, a barrier between her and the rest of the world, but more importantly, her sister. </p>
      <p>The structure was clean, simple, the plot (along with the annoyingly catchy songs) fueled by character motivations; two sisters separated, Elsa embraces her powers, and the two come together to reject the deceptive prince and restore balance to the kingdom.</p>
      <p>It was clean, powerful stuff, and <i>Frozen II </i>makes the mistake of pursuing a plot that has almost nothing to do with the sisters themselves, from an emotional perspective, an exposition dump at the beginning sparking a quest to discover the root of Elsa’s powers (if you were curious), their parent’s past, and the founding of Arendelle. </p>
      <p><i>Frozen II</i> exists purely as a companion piece, constantly, perhaps self-consciously, referencing the original film, along with Disney itself, with Marvel-esque meta humor and several callbacks to <i>Frozen</i>; the sequel just can’t seem to ... let it go (I’m sorry, I had to). </p>
      <p>Of course, this movie isn’t aimed at someone like me; <i>Frozen II</i> is made for those who grew up obsessing over the first film, now entering teenagehood, seeking a nostalgia trip rather than another Disney classic. And it very much succeeds in that regard; I attended a packed screening with my son, filled with ecstatic tweens who audibly loved every single second. In contrast, my son (5 years old), said he enjoyed it, but couldn’t remember any plot points and told me it was “really, really long, like three days long.”</p>
      <p>I’ve been watching Disney+ with my kids all week, so the contrast between this and the Disney classics was particularly stark; this movie wasn’t made to stand by itself. It’s not designed to be a strong, simple fairytale, but an expansion of the lore of the original, increasing the scale of adventure, but lacking the emotional depth.  </p>
      <p>In some regards, it feels like a wasted opportunity, as the world-building is genuinely interesting, and the visuals are absolutely spectacular; one sequence in which Elsa tames a wild water spirit is just as memorable as <i>Let It Go</i> (although lacks the sense of catharsis).   </p>
      <p>There’s much to be impressed by - beautifully rendered rock giants, grand battles with elementals, but the pacing feels slow, with little urgency, or meaning, to the narrative. The characters are taking a small step forward rather than a leap; Anna is about to be proposed to, Elsa is on another journey of self-discovery, and Olaf is contemplating his newfound maturity, a reminder that he was literally conceived during the last film. In fact, Olaf is surprisingly enjoyable this time around, his role as annoying sidekick having switched to fourth-wall breaker.  </p>
      <p>But the songs aren’t nearly as catchy, and lack the emotional resonance. There’s also a clumsy commentary on the founding of America and the genocide of the indigenous people that accompanied it. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spoilers Ahead</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the film rightly acknowledges that the crimes of the past have been whitewashed (something Disney once actively contributed to with <i>Pocahontas</i>), it ends with Elsa erasing the sins of her ancestors (everything’s fine now!) and becoming a shaman to the natives of the forest, which is, amusingly, the very definition of a white savior; why does Disney bother commentating on the heavy stuff if they’re not willing to make an effort to understand it? </p>
      <p>But again, this film wasn’t made for me (or five year olds, for that matter). There is one memorable moment during the climax, in which Olaf melts into tiny snowflakes, <i>Infinity War</i>-style, a tragic, metaphorical death of the childhoods of all the tweens watching, a reminder that those magical days of building snowmen are gone, forever. </p>
      <p>But then he comes back to life again, so whatever. </p>
      <p>Indeed, the resurrection of Olaf summarizes the problem with <i>Frozen II </i>; the movie has one foot in the past and another in the future, unwilling to take the leap and plunge into a more mature adventure; it’s stuck in an aimless, crowd-pleasing limbo.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen II </i>is, undoubtedly, going to make a tremendous amount of money at the box office, but I don’t think it will achieve anywhere near the cultural impact of the first. Then again, it’s not really trying to; the goal of the film is to expand the world, and leave a door open for a sequel, or two.   </p>
