      <h1>Secret Service spent over $250,000 at Trump hotels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:23:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/jessica-campisi" target="_blank">Jessica Campisi</a></address>
      <p>The Secret Service spent more than $250,000 at <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>’s properties over a five-month period in 2017, according to newly released records.</p>
      <p>A Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Property of the People, a nonprofit watchdog group, returned <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/document-detail/?doc-id=6556375-Secret-Service-Payments-to-Trump-Properties-Jan">documents</a> that showed $250,020.94 in credit card purchases at Trump’s properties and businesses between Jan. 27, 2017, and June 29, 2017.</p>
      <p>Most of the expenditures that took place during the time period were at Trump’s golf clubs, while the Secret Service spent more than $45,000 at Trump Hotel in Las Vegas in March 2017, according to the documents.</p>
      <p>The agency spent another total of more than $32,000 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the documents show.</p>
      <p>Multiple $10,000 charges went through on the same day, with Politico noting that since Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida reportedly can’t process individual charges over $10,000, it’s likely that that’s where most of these expenditures took place.</p>
      <p>The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.</p>
      <p>The report comes as Trump continues to face scrutiny over concerns about his decision not to put his company in a blind trust, noting that lobbyists, foreign officials and political insiders may frequent his businesses to earn favor with the administration.</p>
      <p>Multiple <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/administration/461278-appeals-court-allows-trump-emoluments-case-to-move-forward">lawsuits</a> have alleged Trump is in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign governments without Congress’s approval. </p>
      <p>Reports earlier this year revealed the U.S. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/460343-oversight-panel-investigating-air-force-crews-stop-at-trump-property-in">Air Force was spending money</a> at Trump’s Turnberry resort in Scotland and that crews had been sent there <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/air-force/461221-air-force-sent-crews-to-trump-resort-in-scotland-up-to-40-times">up to 40 times</a> in 2015. Around the same time, Vice President Pence <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/460196-democrats-seek-records-from-white-house-on-admin-officials-staying">raised eyebrows</a> when he stayed at the president’s Doonbeg hotel in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Trump has also faced backlash for his since-reversed plan to host the Group of Seven summit at his Doral property. He has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/466732-trump-dismisses-phony-emoluments-clause-after-doral-criticism">dismissed the Emoluments Clause</a> as “phony.”</p>
