      <h1>German Designer Marcell Von Berlin Brings Street Couture To Los Angeles</h1>

      <p>Since the opening of his eponymous store in Los Angeles last year, designer Marcell von Berlin has confidently landed on his feet in the USA’s competitive fashion market. Berlin’s unique street culture that continuously inspires Marcell von Berlin to create clothes that are labeled “street couture.” Masculine and feminine, confident and sensual - the bold sex appeal of his looks were already spotted on some celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Malika Haqq, and <a href="https://www.zedd.net/">Zedd</a>. In addition to his womenswear, menswear and accessories collections, <a href="https://marcellvonberlin.com/en/">Marcell von Berlin</a> has expanded this Fall with an underwear line that pays homage to West Hollywood’s increasingly gender-fluid crowd. Understanding your target customers is one element of success, but it is not everything. Reflecting on his first year doing business in the USA, I sat down with German designer Marcell von Berlin to better understand his formula for success as a young fashion brand on the rise.</p>

        <b>How would you describe the current state of fashion in LA? In Berlin? </b>
      </p>
      <p>Both cities transport a hip "easy-to-wear" vibe that inspires me. They also have a lot in common - it's not for nothing that they are sister cities. Both Berlin and L.A. offer enough space for personal development. Everyone is free to make their own choices and choose their own clothes to express themselves with. For me, fashion means a combination of things - freedom, a light attitude toward life that can be projected onto the style and a certain sexiness.</p>

        <b>Why was it important for you to open a physical store in LA vs other US cities, like NYC?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Los Angeles has become my second home next to Berlin, which made it clear to me that we needed to open the flagship store here.  There is a special spirit in L.A. – it’s the place where a large majority of stars call home and the world pays attention to the fashion on the Hollywood red carpets. I loved the idea of adapting the color scheme of the two cities within the store concept.  While Berlin is a bit darker, sexier and more glamorous, the color concept at the Los Angeles store is more aligned with the blue sky, the ocean, the sun and thus creates an individual experience for each location.</p>

        <b>Do you believe influencers have a role in fashion marketing?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a brand, we regularly work with fashion influencers.  Recently, we worked with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/areyoukitty">@areyoukitty</a> (Kiddy Akita Lou) in the US, as well as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marinathemoss/">@marinathemoss</a> (Marina Ilic) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tommyhey/">@tommyhey</a> (Tommy Hey) in Germany. The industry benefits from their fresh takes on fashion and I believe they have democratized the industry a bit. But just like working with VIPs, the person must fit the brand. Our brand ambassadors are artsy, provocative and have an eye for high-quality fashion. Overall, I see my customers as a new generation of fashion-conscious cool kids with a lot of power and influence, who set trends and allow themselves to be inspired by others.</p>

        <b>How did you come up with that controversial lining print that was featured in your last collection? What was consumer’s reaction to it? </b>
      </p>
      <p>Our provocative visual language is our trademark and exactly what our customers expect from us. Our prints are created in our in-house atelier and are therefore unique. I love prints with a high recognition value - hence the unconventional motifs. These make the Marcell von Berlin signature unique and are an important part of our brand personality.</p>

        <b>What music is currently playing in your office? In your home?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love techno - especially tracks from the Berlin underground. No matter if I am at home, at the gym or in my atelier - the beats drive me. Atmospheric synths, a rolling beat and pulsating rhythm all stand for the spirit of Berlin - just like my brand.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can fashion be both sustainable and sexy? </b>
      </p>
      <p>I've never thought about fashion having to save the world - but it makes life more beautiful, colorful and diverse. Fashion underlines personality, raises self-confidence and is therefore much more than just fabric. As a designer, I'm aware of the responsibility during the creation and I take this into account in the production process. All designs are created at our atelier in Berlin and manufactured to high quality standards in Europe.</p>

        <b>You underwent a personal transformation  over the past few months - focusing on your body and mind - explain your process and methodology that used to arrive at you positive results.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Transformation for me is ongoing.  Focusing on both your body and mind is hard work.  I've been fortunate to have the time to evolve through the years and look forward to future transformations.   If you want to set trends, you must constantly reinvent yourself. It's not that this drive comes from outside, it's simply me. I have a lot of energy that I use to create.</p>
