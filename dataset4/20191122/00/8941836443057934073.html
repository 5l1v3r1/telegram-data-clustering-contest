      <h1>Sharks topple Golden Knights 2-1 in overtime</h1>

      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Logan Couture isn’t always following the calendar enough to know who’s next on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose-sharks/">San Jose Sharks</a>’ schedule. He knew the Golden Knights were coming, though, because the team uses the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/las-vegas/">Las Vegas</a> trip as part of its annual Father’s Trip.</p>
      <p>He made some dads plenty happy Thursday night, scoring in overtime to back 37 save from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-dell/">Aaron Dell</a> in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a>’s 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>“I can barely remember who we play the next game,” Couture said. “You get in the middle of a season, games just kind of happen.”</p>
      <p>This was the first meeting of the Pacific Division rivals since Vegas swept a home-and-home set to open the regular season. The teams have met in the previous two postseasons, splitting those series.</p>
      <p>“Any time we play these guys it’s gonna be a tough game,” Couture said. “They’re a very good team. At the end of the year they’re gonna be near the top of the division, so it was a good test for us.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a> is 7-3-0 in November to improve to 11-11-1 overall. It arrived in Vegas eager for a victory after its six-game winning streak was snapped in Tuesday’s home loss to Edmonton.</p>
      <p>“I think we all know we’re a good team,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose-sharks/">Sharks</a> defenseman Erik Karlsson said.</p>
      <p>Even when they’re short-handed.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose-sharks/">Sharks</a> played without forward Tomas Hertl, who was a late scratch, resulting in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose-sharks/">Sharks</a> using 11 forwards and seven defensemen, rather than the traditional 12/6 ratio. They finished without forward Melker Karlsson and defenseman Radim Simek, both of whom left in the third period.</p>

        <p>Much of the credit went to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-dell/">Dell</a>, who had perhaps his best performance of the season against a team that had given him fits in his three prior meetings. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-dell/">Dell</a> came in 0-2-1 with a 4.28 goals against average and an .868 save percentage against the Golden Knights, but he stopped 33 of 34 shots in regulation and four more in overtime.</p>
        <p>“It was a great character win,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-dell/">Dell</a> said. “I think we really showed that it doesn’t matter who’s in and who’s out, that we can get the job done.”</p>
        <p>Vegas was thwarted on all three attempts by the league’s best penalty kill. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a> has been successful on 22 of its last 24 penalty kills.</p>
        <p>“Our PK was good tonight again,” Karlsson said. “I don’t think they created anything more than a few chances here and there, which is gonna happen. Overall it’s been one of the best parts of our game.”</p>
        <p>Timo Meier scored early in the second period for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a>, and Brayden McNabb tied it midway through the third.</p>
        <p>Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, coming off a highlight-reel save Tuesday, stopped 27 shots.</p>
        <p>“We played pretty good,” Fleury said. “We’re at home. We’re playing against them, too, so we always want to beat them, but at least we battled back to get that point.”</p>
        <p>After a physical start, including a first period that featured 29 combined hits and 20 shots on goal, Meier showed off his strength by holding off defenseman Nate Schmidt. He backhanded the puck past Fleury 1:26 into the second.</p>
        <p>McNabb scored and invigorated Vegas midway through the third, when he fired a shot from the top of the right circle and beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-dell/">Dell</a> glove side with his second goal of the season. Both of the defenseman’s goals this season have come against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a>.</p>
        <p>NOTES: Vegas F Paul Stastny is now two games away from playing in the 900th of his career. … Fans chanted “pay your marker” at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a> F Evander Kane following recent allegations by The Cosmopolitan of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/las-vegas/">Las Vegas</a> that he owes the casino $500,000 in gambling debt. … Dan O’Halloran, one of the two referees in Game 7 of last season’s Western Conference quarterfinal series between Vegas and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a>, was on the ice. O’Halloran was one of the two referees assigned to Game 7, which included a disputed major penalty call on Knights center Cody Eakin that ignited <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-jose/">San Jose</a>’s come-from-behind win in overtime. … Vegas was 2-for-2 with its penalty kill after allowing at least one power-play goal in five of its last seven games. … Vegas F Ryan Reaves, who leads the league with 120 hits and is averaging 5.0 hits per game, registered 12 - his highest total with the Golden Knights.</p>
