      <p>The boxer praised PM Imran Khan as a ‘great sports player and a great politician’, however, saying that he has ‘not done much for sports’. “So you know even though he is a great person but for sports he has not done nothing. Being a sportsman, he has not done anything for sports,” said the boxing star.</p>
      <p>Amir Khan went on with saying, “all the people in Pakistan are crying”. The boxing champion credited himself for being “the only person that does anything for sports” adding that he was taking Pakistani boxers ‘around the world to put them in fights’. Amir Khan revealed that on several occasions in Pakistan he wanted to establish more boxing academies, but he was not getting the help to do so.</p>
