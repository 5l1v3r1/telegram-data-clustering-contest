      <p>At the end of 2020, after over a decade in beta, Google will pick up its product-ending shotgun and take Cloud Print for a talk behind the back shed, from which it will never return. <br/><br/>"Beginning January 1, 2021, devices across all operating systems will no longer be able to print using Google Cloud Print," Google said in a <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006">support note</a>. <br/><br/>"We recommend that over the next year, you identify an alternative solution and execute a migration strategy." <br/><br/>Last week for its own Chrome OS operating system, Google added <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome-enterprise/chrome-enterprise-now-offers-native-print-management/">CUPS printing</a>, which it will use instead of Cloud Print. <br/><br/>"For environments besides Chrome OS, or in multi-OS scenarios, we encourage you to use the respective platform's native printing infrastructure and/or partner with a print solutions provider," Google added.</p>

      <p>In the intervening years, printer vendors <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-hp-eprint-enabled-printers-are-ready-for-google-cloud-print/">added support</a> for the soon-to-be-deceased Cloud Print. <br/><br/>Over the course of 2019, Google has ended a number products. <br/><br/>In June it sent its best email client, Inbox, to the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-sending-trips-to-great-abandoned-app-pile-in-the-sky/">great abandoned app pile in the sky</a>. This was followed by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-to-end-successful-hire-service-in-september-2020/">ending support</a> for its Hire product at the end of August. <br/><br/>Earlier in the year, Google <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-hit-by-second-api-bug-impacting-52-5-million-users/">brought forward</a> the kill date for its Google+ product, and flagged the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-is-when-google-hangouts-will-close-its-doors/">departure of the consumer version</a> of its Hangouts products in January.</p>
