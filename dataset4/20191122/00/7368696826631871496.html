      <blockquote>Serial Cleaner is a story-driven, fast-paced stealth/action game, set in 1970s America. You are a professional cleaner. Your job is to clean up murder scenes by disposing of bodies, cleaning up blood stains and hiding incriminating evidence. A good cleaner never gets caught so you have to make sure you get in, clean up and get out without leaving a trace of evidence for the police to find.</blockquote>
