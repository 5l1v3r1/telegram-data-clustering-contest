      <p>Water &amp; Wastes Digest and Industrial Water &amp; Wastes Digest awarded their 2019 Top Project winners with crystal awards Monday, Sept. 23, at Maggiano’s Little Italy in Chicago during WEFTEC 2019. Each project was nominated through forms on the Water &amp; Wastes Digest website and were evaluated by the editorial team. The winners exemplified excellence in collaboration, strength in overcoming project challenges and by taking their project beyond construction and technical goals. </p>
      <p>Also awarded at the ceremony was the 2019 WWD Industry Icon. This award is given to an individual in the industry who has gone above and beyond to elevate an industry issue, making themselves iconic for their work. This year’s Industry Icon is Doug Riseden, technical support manager for Krausz Hymax. Riseden wants to make everybody in the industry safer, particularly those working in trenches. He has hosted seminars and has taught trench safety lessons at events across the country, and his passion for the issue is seemingly unmatched. Riseden was featured in an article in the September 2019 issue of WWD.</p>
