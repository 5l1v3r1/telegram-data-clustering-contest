      <p>Four youths were arrested for torturing a 12-year-old boy under the pretext of teaching him how to swim inside Sampangiram Nagar lake near Kanteerava Stadium. The four youths pushed him into the water and recorded him while he was struggling to come outside. <br/><br/>The complainant, Lakshmi R, a resident of SR Nagar and a teacher by profession, filed a complaint with the police on November 12 stating that her relativeâ€™s son had sustained injuries after his friends tortured him and beat him up inside the lake. Police said that among the four who have been arrested, three are minors and the fourth accused has been identified as Sandeep, 18. <br/><br/><br/>They were arrested on Friday and sent to juvenile home while Sandeep was sent to judicial custody. In the video, the boy was seen crying and pleading them to leave him alone. The four are seen hitting him and throwing him inside the water.</p>
