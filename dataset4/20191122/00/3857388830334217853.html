      <p>Ethiopia’s ruling coalition on Thursday approved the merger of three of its four ethnic-based parties into a single national one ahead of the 2020 elections, part of the prime minister’s efforts to unite the country, but one of the parties boycotted the meeting and vote.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said the decision to merge had been taken unanimously, as the dissenting members of the coalition were not in the room.</p>
      <p>He also announced that the new party would be called Prosperity Party.</p>
      <p>“The unanimous decision passed today to merge the Party is a crucial step in harnessing our energy to work toward a shared vision. Prosperity Party is committed to strengthening &amp; applying a true Federal system which recognizes the diversity and contributions of all Ethiopians,” he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>The coalition’s leaders approved the new party’s program, coalition spokesman Fekadu Tessema told state broadcaster EBC after the meeting.</p>
      <p>The manoeuvring showed how the country—Africa’s second most populous—is torn between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s unifying drive and various ethnic groups seeking more autonomy.</p>

        <b>Rapid reforms</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abiy is hoping his rapid reforms can win over voters alienated by decades of abuse by the ruling coalition before next year’s elections and he frequently invokes unity.</p>
      <p>Critics say Ethiopia’s 105 million citizens come from more than 80 ethnic groups, and that attempts to impose unity—including forming a single national political party—are doomed.</p>
      <p>“We can’t whitewash the ethnonationalist sentiment, which is the reality,” said Zerihun Teshome, an Addis Ababa-based political analyst and chief executive of a local media company.</p>
      <p>The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) set up a political system after it seized power in 1991 that gives significant autonomy to nine ethnically-based regions, which control local taxes, education, and their own security forces.</p>
      <p>The Sidama ethnic group voted in a referendum this week on whether to create Ethiopia’s 10th region. Results have not yet been released.</p>
      <p>The party that boycotted Thursday’s coalition meeting and abstained from voting condemned the move to form a single party as rushed and undemocratic.</p>
      <p>“The whole process is a total sham. The prime minister didn’t follow the right procedures...it was wrong as well as undemocratic,” said Getachew Reda, a senior member of the Tigrayan party, which dominated the EPRDF before it appointed Abiy, from the Oromo ethnic group.</p>
      <p>Reda said that Abiy had not consulted the coalition’s lower level cadres.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Abiy’s office referred a request for comment on Getachew’s allegation to the ruling coalition spokesman, who was not immediately reachable.</p>
