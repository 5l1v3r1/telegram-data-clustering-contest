      <p>Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold equities worth Rs 22,500 crore in the Indian market in the September quarter, as concerns over weak macroeconomic environment and uncertainty around the US-China trade talks and Brexit kept the risk appetite low.</p>
      <p>There was a shift in the preferences of stocks and sectors as well.</p>
      <p>According to a Kotak Institutional Equities report, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/hotels/lemontreehotelsltd/LTH">Lemon Tree Hotels</a>, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/food-processing/varunbeverages/VB05">Varun Beverages</a> and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/finance-leasing-hire-purchase/shriramtransportfinancecorporation/STF">Shriram Transport</a> saw the highest increase in the stake by FPIs, while <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/computers-software/mindtree/MT13">Mindtree</a>, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/yesbank/YB">Yes Bank</a> and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/finance-housing/lichousingfinance/LIC">LIC Housing Finance</a> saw the biggest drop in stake.</p>
      <p>Diversified financials, IT services and oil, gas and consumable fuels sectors witnessed FPI selling. FPI ownership in the BSE-200 Index declined to 23.8 percent in the September quarter from 24.1 percent in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought banks, consumer staples and oil, gas &amp; consumable fuels sectors. "DIIs holding in the BSE-200 Index increased to 14 percent in the September quarter from 13.5 percent in June quarter," Kotak Institutional Equities said.</p>
