      <h1>'It doesn't look promising': Jim Jordan says Trump will probably be impeached</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:43:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:43</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Pearce</a></address>
      <p>Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said he believes the House will eventually vote to impeach President Trump and force the president to stand trial in the Senate.</p>
      <p>Jordan appeared on Fox News with host Bret Baier on Thursday evening after a day of testimony by former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill and United States Embassy in Ukraine official David Holmes. Thursday may be the final day of impeachment hearings, as no other witnesses have been scheduled to testify.</p>
      <p>Baier asked Jordan if the House will pass articles of impeachment against Trump now that the hearings are likely over.</p>
      <p>"They've got the numbers, but I think what was most telling about that vote a few weeks ago is two Democrats came over to our side. My guess is there will be a few more Democrats come our way," Jordan said, referring to the Oct. 31 House <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">vote</a> to approve the impeachment investigation into Trump.</p>
      <p>"Whether we can have enough to stop them from sending it to the Senate, I don't know. It doesn't look promising," Jordan added.</p>

      <p>The impeachment investigation into Trump began after an anonymous whistleblower filed a complaint alleging Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to force its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>News reports suggest that the whistleblower is Eric Ciaramella, a career CIA analyst. The 33-year-old was the National Security Council's Ukraine expert during the end of the Obama administration, and he stayed in the post for several months into the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Examiner</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-and-whistleblower-still-work-together-on-u-s-policy-towards-ukraine">reported</a> on Oct. 7 that Ciaramella is now a deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council, reporting to the director of national intelligence.</p>
