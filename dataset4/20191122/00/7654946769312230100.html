      <h1>‘The Feed’ is a scary mix of ‘Black Mirror’ and ‘Succession’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:03:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:03</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren Sarner</a></address>
      <p>Channing Powell knows her way around zombies.</p>
      <p>“The Walking Dead” writer and producer is the showrunner for Amazon’s “The Feed,” a British thriller about technology gone awry, turning the masses into metaphorical zombies.</p>
      <p>“I had been on <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/the-walking-dead/">‘The Walking Dead’</a> for five seasons and I was looking for something that felt new and fresh, but that I also felt comfortable with,” Powell tells The Post.</p>
      <p>“This felt like a different way of showing a world where we’re fighting some sort of battle against some sort of enemy or virus that you can’t control. So that felt familiar enough for me to be able to do it, but different enough for it to feel unique.”</p>
      <p>Premiering Friday on Amazon, and based on a 2018 novel of the same name, “The Feed” is set in near-future London and follows the wealthy and famous family of Lawrence Hatflied, the inventor of a piece of technology that, once implanted in people’s brains, enables everyone to share information, emotions and memories. When the implants malfunction and people turn murderous, the family struggles to control their Frankenstein-like creation.</p>
      <p>Starring David Thewlis (“Harry Potter”) as Lawrence, and Michelle Fairley (“Game of Thrones) as Meredith, the show is “Black Mirror” meets “Succession.”</p>
      <p>“It’s in the zeitgeist, everybody is worried about technological advancement, where we’re going with it,” Powell says. “Being somebody who feels inundated by the news every single day … it’s all so overwhelming. It feels like this beast you’re just trying to live amongst and carve out your own sense of well being. That is a permeating anxiety among society today. It feels kind of like we’re all fighting this little battle to have our own existence that feels OK.”</p>
      <p>In the show, which was filmed in Manchester and London, Lawrence and Meredith clash with their son Tom (Guy Burnet, “Chicago Fire”) a psychiatrist who has long been concerned about the effects of the feed. Matters become complicated when his wife Kate (Nina Toussaint-White, “Bodyguard”) seemingly falls prey to its unpleasant side effects after they have a baby.</p>
      <p>The series is so in the zeitgeist that all the social media “feeds” it drew inspiration from — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram — were under scrutiny while Powell was writing it.</p>
      <p>“The hacks with Facebook and [Mark] Zuckerberg going before Congress were all happening as we were writing,” she says. “So it was really interesting to watch all of that unfold. It all felt very of the time and like it was happening in our daily lives. We just had a different presentation for it with ‘The Feed.’ Call it a fantasy, but it is all taken from real life events.”</p>
      <p>The characters of Lawrence and Meredith were inspired by figures such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, she says.</p>
      <p>‘[For] David’s costumes — we tried to envision what Mark Zuckerberg would look like 30 years from now, what would the hoodie turn into. We didn’t want him to be too scientific or buttoned up. I did as much research as I could, I looked into Elon Musk’s Neuralink, and Facebook is allegedly working on something very similar to a brain implantation. But also with that in mind, try and make it feel as accessible as possible to everybody, that it’s not too specific to Facebook or Instagram or Twitter that three years from now, it will feel ancient.”</p>
