      <p><b>to design deqing living house, <a href="http://www.lacime-sh.com/">lacime</a> has followed a traditional layout of axial symmetry, around which three courtyards are positioned. </b>the three main buildings enclosed in the central courtyard sit in the east, west and north respectively. these are called <i>yunbo pavilion</i> in the east, <i>tianqing house</i> in the west and <i>chuoming hall</i> in the north, between which corridors connect each structure.</p>

      <p><b>as the entrance to the building, yunbo pavilion and tianqing house connect both verandas in the south and north, providing sheltered circulation for visitors on rainy days.</b> chuoming hall is divided into above-ground and below-ground space due to the contours of the land. the double-height space above ground is used for reception purpose, while the underground space accessed via a spiral staircase in the west is designed for exhibitions, talks, tea drinking, fitness and swimming.</p>

      <p><b>marking the entrance to the main courtyard, the yunbo pavilion is articulated with a hipped roof to highlight its importance as a gateway.</b> as the exit, tianqing house is furnished with an overhanging gable roof, and as the centerpiece on the central axis, chuoming hall is a major place for receiving guests and adopts a double-eave roof form.</p>

      <p><b>the structural design comes from traditional chinese wooden architecture. </b>the building has a simple architectural structure, comprising of beams, columns and purlins, which are left exposed on the suspended ceiling. the complex is articulated by elements of timber, glazing and water, which together create a tranquil place, ultimately befitting the forest location.</p>
