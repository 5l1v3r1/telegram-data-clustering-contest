      <p>Lyricist-turned-director Kaviraj returns with <i>Kaalidaasa Kannada Meshtru</i>, a comedy film that dwells on the issues concerning school education. The film releasing today is made under the Uday Films banner of producer UR Udaykumar, with Jaggesh and Meghana Gaonkar playing the lead roles. <br/><br/>Kaviraj says the film will get the audience to take a closer look at the state of education, especially in schools. “We always criticise the current system that focuses more on attaining marks than actual learning. <i>Kalidaasa Kannada Meshtru</i> touches upon the issues concerning education in a fun manner. But at the end of it, you come out convinced that there needs to be a fundamental change in the system. <br/><br/><br/>That is the result towards which the film aspires. You will be reminded of your school days,” he said. There is no dearth of entertainment in the film says Kaviraj. “Though the film has a serious issue at its core, it is full of entertainment. Fans of Jaggesh expect him to act and deliver dialogues in a particular way. This is the first combination of Jaggesh and Meghana Gaonkar,” Kaviraj said.</p>
