      <h1>The Situation at Syracuse Is A “Woke” Up Call For Us All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Kwittken</a></address>
      <p>In active shooter drills we are taught to “run, hide, fight.” If you can’t run to safety then try to shelter safely in place. If you can’t do that, then fight for your life. In the world of crisis communications we adopt the exact opposite mantra. Instead, it’s just “fight.”  Never run from the issue. Don’t try to hide it or <i>from </i>it and always be prepared to respond swiftly. To be clear, when I say fight, what I really mean is comment, engage, participate, address, own and act on the issue. Engage key stakeholders, be transparent, be remorseful, humble, preemptive and proactive.</p>
      <p>Syracuse University is the latest high-profile example of a university finding itself in the crosshairs of a crisis – and the practice of crisis communications – following a series of ugly, hateful racist incidents on campus. For a brief recap of the last ten days of this crisis, read this story by <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/syracuse-university/2019/11/notagainsu-a-timeline-of-racist-incidents-at-syracuse-university.html">Syracuse.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Like companies and other organizations, universities are not immune to scandal, acts of violence, hate, hateful speech and misconduct.  From salacious and insidious behavior from the likes of Penn and Michigan State to the unmasking of the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, there’s new and unprecedented amounts of pressure on deans, chancellors and trustees to be better prepared and ready to communicate quickly and deliberately.</p>
      <p>And while companies sometimes have to deal with protestors, strikes and unions alike, universities, especially the U.S.-based ones, have always had a long, proud and storied history of being at the forefront of social activism and change and have a built-in, ready-to-go populace of protestors – as seen at Syracuse by way of sit-in’s, protests and long lists of student demands seen <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/syracuse-university/2019/11/syracuse-chancellor-kent-syverud-signs-list-of-student-demands-with-3-edits.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Rather than dissect a developing crisis and criticize how Syracuse has been handling the situation in real-time, let’s take a look at what ALL universities can learn from this: </p>
      <p>1)    You are not just judged for<i> what</i> happened, it's <i>how quickly you react</i> to what happened and what you say and do in response to the incident.</p>
      <p>2)    It's important to separate the facts from speculation/rumor at the outset and convey what you know at <i>that time</i> as quickly as possible and arrange accessible means (website, Slack) to be able to update the public and key stakeholders as appropriate as new information becomes available.</p>
      <p>3)    You always need to plan in advance for all possible and probable scenarios so you can activate your crisis communications plan at a moment’s notice and not have to improvise on the fly. This plan should include lists of key stakeholders, draft statements, draft emails and texts, spokespeople and an approvals process.</p>
      <p>4)    Schedule media and presentation training for your spokespeople in advance. Have more than one spokesperson, too. Consider having a “spokesbench” of people with different expertise be available to comment.  For example, in addition to the university chancellor, perhaps you could also have someone representing student affairs, multicultural affairs, student representatives, an alumni representative, etc.</p>
      <p>5)    Invite key stakeholders IN to help you craft your narrative in an authentic manner. Don’t dismiss them, invalidate their feelings or isolate them. </p>
      <p>Ironically, Syracuse is lauded for having one of the top media, communications and public relations schools in the world, the <a href="https://newhouse.syr.edu/">Newhouse School</a>. Hopefully the Board will continue to tap into professors and alumni from Newhouse to better harden themselves against future issues. </p>
