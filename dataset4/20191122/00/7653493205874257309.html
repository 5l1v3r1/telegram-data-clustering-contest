      <h1>Netgear Canvas II Announced</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Netgear has unveiled its updated Canvas digital art display from Meural, following the acquisition of the connected frame company, bringing some minor improvements to an already great product.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://meural.netgear.com/canvasII/"><u>Meural Canvas II from Netgear</u></a> is available in two sizes, the 21.5-inch for $399.95 and the 27-inch model for $599.95.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the digital art display is only available for pre-order in the US, though considering the original Canvas is being sold in Australia, ChannelNews expects the second iteration to find its way here soon enough.</p>
      <p>Both screens sport a 1080p full-HD display with ambient light sensors, now located under the mat that surrounds the screen, to automatically adjust screen brightness.</p>

      <p>Powering the display is a 1.8 GHz Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A17 processor with 2GB of DDR3 RAM and 8GB of storage.</p>
      <p>Built-in Wi-Fi, thanks to Netgear, has also been upgraded with ethernet connectivity added for a more reliable and stable connection.</p>
      <p>If you aren’t connecting the Canvas II digital art display to the internet, then the included full-sized SD port will give you as much art as you need to display for weeks on end, even GIFs.</p>
      <p>There’s even a Marvel artwork pack available for all those superhero fans out there, though sadly no DC Comics.</p>
      <p>Each Canvas II comes with 42 preloaded images and access to 100 sampler images from <a href="https://my.meural.netgear.com/categories/1048/sampler-playlists?_ga=2.83098070.1115891051.1574384050-897991402.1574384050"><u>Meural’s art library</u></a>.</p>

      <p>The Canvas II is mounted vertically or horizontally, and thanks to the optional Swivel Mount (US$49.95), it’s easy to rotate the display however you want.</p>
      <p>Controlled via the Meural companion app, Canvas II has access to 30,000+ curated collections of artwork, some free and others at a cost.</p>
      <p>Paying for a subscription to the Meural art collection will get you 30GB of cloud storage for uploading your art or photographs, as well as discounts for purchases and access to a much more extensive photo library.</p>
      <p>The subscription will cost US$8.95 per month, or US$69.95 for a whole year.</p>
      <p>Motion controls have even been included allowing users to navigate between artworks and photographs, plus other functionality like accessing menus and changing art playlists with the wave of a hand.</p>
      <p>Or if you prefer using your voice, you can call on Amazon’s Alexa to find new artwork.</p>
      <p>Through the app, users can also curate their favourite artworks, personalise their settings and schedule what displays and when.</p>
