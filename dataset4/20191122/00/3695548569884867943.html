        <b>Artem Markelov will compete in Formula 2 for a seventh season as the ex-Renault Formula 1 junior joins the new HWA team for 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Markelov first contested the series in 2014 when it was known as GP2. His best finish came in the first year of the F2 era in 2017 when he was runner-up to Charles Leclerc but, after concluding his stint with the Russian Time squad, he joined Super Formula in '19.</p>
      <p>However, he replaced the Indy 500-bound Jordan King at the MP Motorsport team for this year's Monaco round, and is contesting the final two F2 events of 2019 with Arden - which will be replaced by HWA next year - after a troublesome period in Japan.</p>
      <p>"I am really looking forward to racing for HWA RACELAB in Formula 2 next season," said Markelov, who failed to score a point in in Super Formula and was 21st overall.</p>
      <p>"I think we will gel quickly.</p>
      <p>"HWA has a vast wealth of motorsport experience, from which I am sure I will benefit."</p>
      <p>Formula E and DTM company HWA branched out into junior single-seaters for the first time when it fielded a three-car team in FIA Formula 3 this year, finishing fifth in the teams' standings with Jake Hughes its highest-placed driver in the points in seventh.</p>

      <p>HWA has purchased Arden's F2 entry, cars and equipment for 2020.</p>
      <p>The two outfits signed an engineering deal for 2019, with the team's regular drivers - the late Anthoine Hubert and Tatiana Calderon - both receiving support from HWA engineers.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Fritz, HWA's CEO, said Markelov's experience would prove helpful as the team becomes a separate entity.</p>
      <p>"Artem is the ideal driver for us in our first season as an independent team in Formula 2," said Fritz.</p>
      <p>"He has lots of experience at this level. His tally of eight race wins speaks for itself.</p>
      <p>"His expertise as a driver will help make our introduction to the series easier. I am pleased that we were able to acquire his services."</p>
      <p>HWA is yet to reveal its second driver for the 2020 season.</p>
