      <p>"Hard-working Americans don’t deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need," Trump said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197954041139146754?s=20">tweet</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The plan will be released soon by the Department of Health and Human Services, Trump's tweet said. There were few details, although Trump attacked House Democrats for not passing drug-pricing legislation, although it has passed 10 bills on the topic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trump has been talking for some time about a prescription drug plan to push prices lower. A key question is where the drugs would come from. Canada has said it doesn't have the supplies on hand to lower U.S. prices appreciably.</p>
      <p>Shares of pharmaceutical giants Merck (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/merck---co">MRK</a>), Pfizer (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/pfizer">PFE</a>), Eli Lilly (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/eli-lilly-and-co">LLY</a>) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/johnson-johnson">JNJ</a>) were all higher on Friday.
