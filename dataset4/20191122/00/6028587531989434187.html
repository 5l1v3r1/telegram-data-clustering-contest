      <p>It requires years and years of schooling — and therefore money — to become a dentist in the United States. With the cost of education, let alone medical school, constantly on the rise, pursuing a career in dentistry might be discouraging for many. However, if you’re truly interested and genuinely love the field, dentistry can certainly pay off in the long run. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nurse-anesthetists-nurse-midwives-and-nurse-practitioners.htm">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a>, employment of dentists is projected to increase much faster than average, with approximately 11,600 dentist jobs being added from 2018 to 2028, an increase of 7%. Using occupational data from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, we've analyzed and compiled a round-up of the average dentist salary by state in the U.S. Read on for a full breakdown of where dentists make the most money, and where they're making the least.</p>
      <h3>10 States Where Dentists Earn the Most Money</h3>
      <p>For the purposes of this study, dentists refer to the detailed occupation recognized by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">BLS</a><u> </u>as “dentists, general.” The national average annual wage of a dentist is $175,840, over three times the average annual salary for all occupations, $51,960. Plus, the average dentist salary has grown by 6.8% over the last five years, from $164,570 in 2013 to where it stands now.</p>
      <p>The thing is, the average dentist salary varies substantially depending on the state in which you’re located. In many states, the average dentist salary is $200,000, while in other states, it can be as low as $50,000 less than the national average.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of the top-10 highest-paying states for dentists:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Delaware average dentist salary</b>: $264,440</li>
        <li><b>Alaska average dentist salary</b>: $259,350</li>
        <li><b>Rhode Island average dentist salary</b>: $254,190</li>
        <li><b>Minnesota</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $227,280</li>
        <li><b>New Hampshire</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $226,300</li>
        <li><b>Connecticut</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $213,390</li>
        <li><b>Wisconsin</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $213,210</li>
        <li><b>North Dakota</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $212,380</li>
        <li><b>North Carolina</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $212,160</li>
        <li><b>Nevada</b> <b>average dentist salary</b>: $210,710</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The supply and demand forces influence the average wage of dentists in the U.S. No. 8 North Dakota, No. 2 Alaska and No. 1 Delaware have fewer than 300 dentists employed in the state, and rank among the best-paying for dentists. Meanwhile, dentists in Nevada and New Hampshire benefit from no state individual income tax, except on interest and dividends in New Hampshire.</p>

      <h3>10 States Where Dentists Earn the Least Money</h3>
      <p>The bottom-10 states where dentists make the least money is an unusual mix of states geographically. There are some understandable southern states like Mississippi and West Virginia that pay dentists less, but they also have lower-than-average incomes for most jobs anyway. However, there are some surprising states, like California, which normally has elevated incomes for most occupations compared to other states. Wyoming is also interesting because it has very few dentists, a feature that benefited dentist’s salaries in some of its neighboring states, but wages don’t reflect this in a positive way.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the bottom-10 states for dentist salaries:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Louisiana average dentist salary</b>: $124,020</li>
        <li><b>Wyoming average dentist salary</b>: $125,120</li>
        <li><b>Nebraska average dentist salary</b>: $135,080</li>
        <li><b>Utah average dentist salary</b>: $138,970</li>
        <li><b>West Virginia average dentist salary</b>: $139,170</li>
        <li><b>California average dentist salary</b>: $151,490</li>
        <li><b>Maryland average dentist salary</b>: $1051,950</li>
        <li><b>Mississippi average dentist salary</b>: $153,810</li>
        <li><b>Pennsylvania average dentist salary</b>: $153,950</li>
        <li><b>Kentucky average dentist salary</b>: $154,230</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How Much Do Dentists Make in Each State</h3>
      <p>Below you’ll find the average annual wage for dentists in all 50 states from 2013 to 2018. Note that the BLS does not have Vermont dentist salary data for 2018, so it isn’t ranked, but there is data for 2013 through 2017.</p>
