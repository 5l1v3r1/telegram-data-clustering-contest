      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bradley-beal/">Bradley Beal</a> had 30 points and 12 assists, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-bryant/">Thomas Bryant</a> added 21 points and 11 rebounds and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Washington Wizards</a> overcame a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter for a 125-118 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charlotte-hornets/">Charlotte Hornets</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/davis-bertans/">Davis Bertans</a> added 20 points off the bench, hitting six 3-pointers to help the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a> win two in a row for the first time this season. Jordan McCrae scored eight of his 13 in the fourth, including a baseline 3 that put <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> in front for good.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bradley-beal/">Beal</a> extended his career-best streak of scoring 30 or more points to five games as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a> snapped a three-game skid against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charlotte-hornets/">Hornets</a>.</p>
      <p>Miles Bridges scored a career-high 31 for Charlotte, which has now lost at least three in a row for a third time this season.</p>
      <p>Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier and Malik Monk each added 19 points for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charlotte-hornets/">Hornets</a>, who were on pace for their highest-scoring performance of the season until a 22-point fourth quarter.</p>

      <p>Down 13 early in the fourth after Charlotte’s 11-2 run, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> replied with 11 straight points and ultimately outscored the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charlotte-hornets/">Hornets</a> 29-9 down the stretch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/davis-bertans/">Bertans</a> hit his final 3 of the game off <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bradley-beal/">Beal</a>’s feed to close the margin to four. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bradley-beal/">Beal</a> followed by driving the lane to get to the foul line, sinking a pair of free throws to make it 109-107 with 6:13 left.</p>
      <p>Several possessions later, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/davis-bertans/">Bertans</a> spotted McCrae for a baseline 3 to put <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> up 116-114. And it was McCrae’s contested runner that essentially sealed the victory several possessions later, making it 122-116 with 29 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Up next, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a> host the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.</p>
