      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York’s governor says the state will investigate discrimination among real estate agents on Long Island in light of a newspaper’s report.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Thursday announcement follows Newsday’s report that detailed real estate agents on Long Island engaging in discriminatory conduct such as steering clients toward certain neighborhoods based on their perceived race or ethnicity.</p>
      <p>He says he’s directing state agencies to investigate discriminatory real estate practices on Long Island. Cuomo says such agencies will release new regulations to better protect renters and homeowners against discriminatory treatment.</p>
      <p>Cuomo says the state is also launching a social media campaign and hotline to raise awareness of housing discrimination and help individuals file complaints.</p>
