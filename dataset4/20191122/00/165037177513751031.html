        <b>Tottenham appointed Jose Mourinho as their new boss on Wednesday and Manchester United chief Ed Woodward was quick to congratulate him.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jose Mourinho revealed he received a "special" message </b>from <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward after being named Tottenham head coach.</p>
      <p>Three-time Premier League title winner Mourinho was appointed by <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Wednesday, <b>less than 12 hours on from Mauricio Pochettino's departure</b>. Mourinho had been out of work since being sacked by United last December following a poor run of form that left the club sixth in the Premier League. Despite his acrimonious split with United, <b>Mourinho was congratulated by Woodward </b>for landing a new job.</p>
      <p>"<b>I received messages from everybody</b>, everywhere [from my former clubs]," he told Sky Sports News.</p>

      <p>"<b>Maybe I get the opportunity to apologise for not answering 500 of them</b> that I couldn't answer. I have 700 but only had time to answer 200. But it was curious to see, from my last club<b>, so many people showing me that respect</b>, empathy and feeling. It was nice. All of them were special. The first one was from [United managing director] Richard Arnold. The third, fourth or fifth was Ed Woodward. <b>And they were my bosses</b>."</p>
      <p>Mourinho's relationship with Woodward appeared to be strained at times over a disagreement on transfer targets,<b> but he is not expecting that to be an issue </b>with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p><b>"I think we will get on well</b>," Mourinho said. "He explained to me the vision for the club and I embraced that. It was one of the most important reasons I accepted. <b>So when I did that, it's a very good start</b>."</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of Tottenham for the first time on Saturday <b>when they travel to London rivals West Ham</b>.</p>
