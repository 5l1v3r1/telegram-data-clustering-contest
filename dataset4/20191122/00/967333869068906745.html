        <b>The Twitter account representing UK aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth released on Thursday footage documenting a demo flight of a real-life 'rocket man' launched from the giant warship currently berthed three miles off of Annapolis, Maryland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Demo flight pilot Richard Browning, a former Royal Marine reservist and ultra-marathon runner, invented the jet pack and worked with the Royal Navy on the development of his project.</p>
      <p>Browning, who founded Gravity Industries in 2017, made <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201709061057142195-aircraft-carriers-plane-numbers/">a short flight around the aircraft carrier</a>, stunning the passengers of a nearby passing private yacht.</p>
      <blockquote>"Now this is the way to travel to work! What a fantastic viewpoint of the ship - what you can’t see is the queue of excited matelots wanting to have a go! From one type of jet #UKF35 to another @takeonGravity #WESTLANT19," wrote the Twitter account of the HMS Queen on the post.</blockquote>

      <p>Browning’s jet pack uses five small but powerful gas turbines to produce over 1,000 horsepower, allowing it to travel at speeds up to 89 km/h.</p>
      <p>The longest flight made by Browning and his new jet pack occurred in September, as he succeeded in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201708161056502871-queen-elizabeth-arrives-portsmouth/">crossing a distance of 1.3 km</a> from Hurst Castle in Lymington, to Fort Albert in Freshwater.</p>
