      <p>Kolkata. India's Umesh Yadav led an inspired pace attack Friday to leave Bangladesh tottering at 73 for six in the first day-night Test for both teams.</p>
      <p>Yadav claimed three wickets in India's pink-ball debut to rattle Bangladesh's top and middle order after they elected to bat first in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Nayeem Hasan was batting on nought and Liton Das retired hurt on 24 at tea -- the first break in the day-night game.</p>
      <p>Liton was hit by a Mohammed Shami bouncer in the penultimate over before the break and looked uncomfortable in the next over from Ishant Sharma.</p>
      <p>The batsman got physio attention before the umpires called for the break.</p>
      <p>India and Bangladesh have joined the pink-ball party four years after the first day-night Test in Adelaide between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
