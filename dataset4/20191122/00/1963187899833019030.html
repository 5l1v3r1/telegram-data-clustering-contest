      <p>RAMALLAH - 22 Novemebr 2019: Israeli settlers torched overnight several Palestinian vehicles and scrawled hate graffiti in the northern West Bank district of Nablus, said a settlement watchdog. <br/><br/>Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors Israeli colonial settlement construction in northern West Bank, said a group of settlers sneaked their way into Majdal Bani Fadel and Qabalan villages, where they torched several vehicles and scrawled anti-Palestinian hate graffiti, state news agency WAFA reported Friday. <br/><br/>Settlers also sneaked their way to Beit Dajan village, east of Nablus city, where they vandalized a villager’s house and set his vehicle on fire. <br/><br/>Many Palestinian activists and rights groups have repeatedly blamed Israel for fostering a “culture of impunity” for Jewish settlers committing violent acts against Palestinians. <br/><br/>Over 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law</p>
