The bankrupt retailer began liquidating its assets in April after failing to find a buyer. The company was expected to close all of its 220 stores by the end of May, resulting in about 5,000 layoffs across the U.S., according to USA Today.

      <p>It may not have made much of a dent in your world, but the higher education community has been abuzz in the past several days about a list that was not released. Inside Higher Ed has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/11/19/private-colleges-convinced-company-scuttle-release-list-projected-college-closures">a well-reported summary</a> of the news that was not, but the skinny is that a private consulting and advising firm called <a href="https://www.edmit.me/">Edmit</a> pulled together a list of private colleges and, based on public sources and data such as tuition, discounts, enrollments and spending patterns, calculated when they thought those schools would run out of cash and close. According to reporting, some schools threatened to sue. Edmit retreated and the list was not made public.</p>
      <p>Deciding not to publish the list received most of the attention, sparked, rightly, by colleges being in the unusual position of wanting to limit public information and subsequent discussion and debate. They look as though they’re hiding. And, indeed, it’s not a good look.</p>
      <p>But the colleges are right.</p>
      <p>It’s impossible for anyone outside the highest levels of an institution to get an accurate financial picture of a school. In fact, I’d wager that those inside may not have a full view all the time either.</p>
      <p>No public data can account for what plans any given school may have to increase revenue or cut expenses or both, to say nothing of actions such as tapping donors, raiding an endowment or borrowing against it. Some schools <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/university-discovers-solution-to-drop-in-chinese-students-insurance.html">have insurance policies</a> against declines in enrollment. Others have plans to open new programs and schools in underserved communities. When it comes to projecting college finances, simple math is simply inadequate. So, any list based on that math that claims a school will close in two years, or five years is irresponsible.</p>
      <p>Such a guess would, in all likelihood, cause deep and lasting harm to any university assumed to have a short fiscal runway. They don’t often, but in this case, market principles apply – the estimate becomes inevitability. The rules of short-selling set in. A school closes because it could not get new students because someone said it was closing.</p>
      <p>If an assessment is accurate, a school by school audit, that’s one thing. Let’s have that. But this proposed listing could not possibly be, not for all 946 schools reported to be on the reported list. Given that, schools were right to argue that a bad list would be far more damaging than no list at all. Schools were right to resist a collective diagnosis without seeing the doctor personally.</p>
      <p>Publishing a list of when any specific school may run out of money and close is akin to publishing a list of when any particular asteroid is most likely to hit Earth and end all life. It may be interesting and spark a debate but it’s not particularly realistic or useful.</p>
      <p>What’s even more troubling than making such a potentially damaging, two-dimensional assessment of school finances is the misplaced narrative it feeds – a narrative that private schools are in financial danger at a large scale. While some have wildly and irresponsibly speculated that “half” or more of all colleges will go bankrupt, that has not happened. It’s not going to happen. As I’ve <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/09/11/no-there-wont-be-massive-college-bankruptcies/#7ffbb635d75b">written repeatedly</a>, there is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2019/03/27/the-coming-renaissance-of-non-profit-colleges/#647974194bf4">no evidence</a> to support anything like that.</p>
      <p>Sure, twenty-something private schools have closed since 2016 but no one ever reports that more than half of those were abnormally small bible colleges. Or that, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cha.asp">according to the Department of Education</a>, “Undergraduate enrollment is projected to increase by 3 percent … between 2017 and 2028.” Or that there <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_csa.asp">were more private non-profit colleges</a> in 2017-18 than there were in 2012-13 which was more than there were in 2000-2001.</p>
      <p>There’s no question that demographic changes and economic instability and poor management will strain some colleges – even force some to close. But there’s no crisis among the country’s private non-profit colleges. And although we collectively act as though it’s impossible and apocalyptic every single time a school closes, case by case closures, consolidations and realignments are a good thing. They are a sign of a healthy marketplace, efficiencies are being achieved, needs are being filled.</p>
      <p>Moreover, of all the ways to judge the value of a college, fiscal prowess is a pretty poor one. Five years ago, such a list would have told us that for-profit schools were highly stable. Based on their balance sheets, they looked like very safe bets. They were awash in cash and could not open programs and schools fast enough. Now, they are closing faster than Sears stores, stranding tens of thousands of students at a time.</p>
      <p>For-profit colleges are the very worst colleges in the country because they’re not colleges, they’re businesses. They are loosely regulated, teach nearly entirely online and are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2019/06/11/why-hr-managers-need-to-know-about-acics/#7bcdbf8968ef">even more loosely accredited</a>. But five years ago, a list that used income and enrollment and expenses to assess college longevity would have made them seem unsinkable – never mind the lack of quality, never mind that they never were.  </p>
      <p>In fact, what does a robust balance sheet say about a school anyway? It tells me they’re probably not investing enough in the quality of the education they provide.</p>
      <p>Even so, the doomsday prophesies of massive school closures persist. Right on cue, some higher education watchers are already citing the fact that colleges did not want this third party balance sheet listing as proof that they are hiding their true, dire condition. Had the list been published they would have said, ‘see, colleges are going under.’ No list, they say, ‘see, colleges are going under.’</p>
      <p>Rather than a list, here’s a better idea. If you are worried or even curious about the financial health of a college, ask them. It’s a good, reasonable question for any student, parent or community leader to ask. As non-profits, most of their detailed, audited financial records are public already anyway, which makes the fuss over this list a molehill’s molehill and a mountain only to those who want to see mountains.</p>
