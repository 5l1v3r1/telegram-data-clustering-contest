      <p>When Quentin Tarantino’s highly-anticipated <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> hit theaters in July 2019, the $41.08 million box office debut gave the filmmaker the best opening weekend of his career.“I think I anticipated that opening weekend. What’s funny is people kept underestimating us. I said, ‘Do they really not have faith?’ I honestly felt like we could do it,” explained producer Shannon McIntosh as we chatted at the iconic Hollywood restaurant, Musso and Frank Grill – it’s one of the locations featured in the movie.</p>
      <p>“You have some test audiences that watch it, and we’d shown it in Cannes, and the reaction there was favorable. I anticipated the film’s success, but when you’re close to something, it can be so hard to tell, so there was a little bit of me that wondered if I was wrong? When it came out, it achieved pretty much what I expected, so it was wonderful to see that it really resonated, and I was right.”</p>
      <p>Having exceeded expectations that first weekend, <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, has gone on to gross $371.54 million at the worldwide box office. It cost $90 million to make.</p>
      <p>“What was also great about it was that it didn’t just end after the first weekend. Some movies come out and have a blitz opening weekend, but with the word of mouth we got and with some of the reviews we received, we continued to well. Some of the box office success, especially in non-domestic markets, was great,” said McIntosh, who is a regular collaborator with Tarantino.</p>
      <p>“What was wonderful about Cannes was that there were people who could see the movie earlier than usual, from other territories, and they knew what they could do to market it and get it out to the public. What was fascinating to do was take the movie around the world and see how it resonated with people. It was especially interesting in Japan or Russia.”</p>
      <p>She added: “In Russia, they are rabid Tarantino fans. I felt like I was traveling with one of The Beatles. The audience there seems to be so on board with his films. In Japan, I mean, I think a lot of the emotions in the movie seemed to really appeal to the audience there because it’s such a sweet, heart-warming story in so many ways.”</p>
      <p>$230.62 million, over 62% of <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>’s global gross, has come from non-domestic markets.</p>

      <p>The film is another of Tarantino’s love letters to Los Angeles. It’s not only the city he calls home, but it’s also where he owns a movie theater, the <a href="http://www.thenewbev.com/">New Beverly</a> on Beverly Boulevard, where <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> has been showing consistently, to frequently sold-out audiences, since the start of its theatrical run. </p>
      <p>“I don’t know if that had a huge part in the film’s box office success, but I think that it has a wonderful part in the narrative,” mused McIntosh. “A friend of mine I saw when we were in Japan and texted me because he’d met a guy who had heard that we had a new scene that was going to be shown at the <a href="http://www.thenewbev.com/">New Beverly</a>, so he flew from New York to Los Angeles to see the movie for the seventh time. That is a dedicated fan.”</p>
      <p>“You will have people who come from all over the world specifically to go and see it there or wait online for the tickets to hit because it has been selling out. Quentin programs his movies in wonderful ways there. It’s a whole experience.”</p>
      <p>Critics and fans praised the film’s leads, Brad Pitt and Leonard DiCaprio, for their performances, which have generated awards season buzz. Thankfully it came together.</p>
      <p>“For the most part, we had various people in mind who we talked about and imagined could play these parts. Obviously, Quentin wished for Brad and Leo to fill these roles, but there are so many things that go into getting schedules to align, making the deals and so on,” McIntosh revealed. </p>
      <p>“The good thing is that people read Quentin’s scripts, people know him, they know his work, and they want to work with him. Luckily, Brad and Leo both loved the movie. I really could never imagine anyone else doing it. Still, there were some other scenarios we talked about with either one of those guys doing it with someone else, having a different duo, but we were so blessed to get them. I know they loved working with Quentin, and he’s worked with both of them separately before, Brad on <i>Inglorious Basterds</i> and Leo on <i>Django Unchained</i>. Watching the three of them on set, creating this magic, was quite an experience.”</p>
      <p><i>Django Unchained</i> and <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> remain two of Tarantino’s top three highest-grossing movies with $450 million and $316 million at the worldwide box office, respectively. <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, with its global gross of $371.54 million, is nestled right in between the two.</p>
      <p>Following a recent pre-awards season rerelease of the film with an additional ten minutes of footage, Tarantino’s opus is heading to digital, Blu-ray, and DVD loaded with extra footage and other features. Earlier this year, Tarantino’s 2015 movie <i>The Hateful Eight</i>, already available as a feature film, appeared on Netflix in a new form, having been re-edited as a four-episode miniseries. Could we expect the same thing to happen with <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood </i>in the future?</p>
      <p>It’s something McIntosh hasn’t ruled out. She explained, “We shoot a lot and try and make something that’s in a manageable time period. With The Hateful Eight, we did an intermission, but we didn’t want to do that with this, we wanted to let people be able to go and sit and watch a movie and have to get up to go to the bathroom.” </p>
      <p>“But, you know, there are some juicy morsels that are on the DVD and Blu-ray that you’ll see. What we did with <i>The Hateful Eight</i> on Netflix was create a four-part series where we added a little bit more footage that didn’t quite make the final cut of the movie. So, there’s always the chance to reimagine some of those things and make it different.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure what we’re going to do there,” she concluded. “We imagine there will be something down the line, but Quentin’s got to go deal with his current production, a baby, and then we’ll figure out what he wants to do. Then we’ll know whether it’s full or in parts. We’ll see.”</p>
      <p>
        <b><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood </i>is available on digital from Friday, November 22, 2019, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD from Tuesday, December 10, 2019.</b>
