      <h1>Mourinho: Woodward one of first to congratulate me on Tottenham job</h1>

      <p>Jose Mourinho revealed he received a "special" message from Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward after being named Tottenham head coach.</p>
      <p>Three-time Premier League title winner Mourinho was appointed by Tottenham on Wednesday, less than 12 hours on from Mauricio Pochettino's departure.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of work since being sacked by United last December following a poor run of form that left the club sixth in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Despite his acrimonious split with United, Mourinho was congratulated by Woodward for landing a new job.</p>
      <p>"I received messages from everybody, everywhere [from my former clubs]," he told Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>"Maybe I get the opportunity to apologise for not answering 500 of them that I couldn't answer. I have 700 but only had time to answer 200.</p>
      <p>"But it was curious to see, from my last club, so many people showing me that respect, empathy and feeling. It was nice.</p>
      <p>"All of them were special. The first one was from [United managing director] Richard Arnold. The third, fourth or fifth was Ed Woodward. And they were my bosses."</p>
      <p>Mourinho's relationship with Woodward appeared to be strained at times over a disagreement on transfer targets, but he is not expecting that to be an issue with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>"I think we will get on well," Mourinho said. "He explained to me the vision for the club and I embraced that. It was one of the most important reasons I accepted. So when I did that, it's a very good start."</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of Tottenham for the first time on Saturday when they travel to London rivals West Ham.</p>
