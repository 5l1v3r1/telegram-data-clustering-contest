      <p>Despite the government’s efforts to convince PayPal, the American company has decided against introducing its services in Pakistan. PayPal operates a worldwide online payment system that supports online money transfers, to introduce its services in the country.</p>

      <p>Pakistan’s Ministry of Information Technology Secretary Maroof Afzal informed the Senate committee today that Paypal’s internal working is such that “they are not ready to introduce its services”, local media reported.</p>
      <p>The company officials told the delegation that Pakistan is not included in its three-year road map, at the moment, as it does not have adequate business opportunities to attract the firm.</p>
      <p>In November 2015, the IT Ministry had announced that it was set to invite PayPal and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to offer their services in Pakistan. The move followed a decision by the global Financial Action Task Force to remove Pakistan from its list of high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions linked to money laundering.</p>
