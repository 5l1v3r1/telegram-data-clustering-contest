      <p>The arrival of a new manager at any soccer club brings multiple questions. Which players that were previously on the bench might get a chance to shine? Who might the new coach be able to improve? Which players will they get on with? Who might be moved on? When that new manager is José Mourinho, those questions are amplified until they become deafening.When Mourinho feels the need to assert his authority, he can be ruthless. At Real Madrid, the Portuguese dropped legendary goalkeeper Iker Cassillas to the bench. In Mourinho’s second spell at Chelsea, Juan Mata, who had won the club’s Player of the Season award for two consecutive campaigns, was deemed surplus to requirements and sold to Manchester United. At United, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were sidelined for long spells.</p>
      <p>Naturally, when Mourinho was announced as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement at Spurs, people wondered whose turn it would be next.</p>
      <p>Yet Mourinho’s early declarations combined with reports in The Guardian that he will not have any money to spend in January - something he must have known about before he signed his reported $19.3m-a-year contract - suggest that he might have reassessed how he handles his squad. Might this be Mourinho Mk3; The Mellow One?</p>

      <p>“I am stronger, I am relaxed, I am motivated”, the new boss stated in his first press conference after taking the job, adding that he has “learned that sometimes you have to work with people that don’t love you and work well”.</p>
      <p>Moving on to the subject of his new charges, he was effusive. “The best gift are the players who are here”, he said, “I tried to buy some of them for different clubs and I couldn’t. I don’t need [new] players. I love this squad.”</p>
      <p>There are some at Spurs who would immediately have felt positive about their chances under the new boss. Eric Dier is one of those previously targeted by the Portuguese and will hope to get a much-needed boost, Toby Alderweireld was also on José’s shopping list when he was United manager and Harry Kane is perhaps the ultimate Mourinho striker, combining physical presence, hard work and an exceptional goal-scoring record.</p>
      <p>But there is one less obvious candidate who could benefit more than any other from Mourinho’s arrival: Dele Alli.</p>

      <p>Alli has been in a funk of late. His form, along with the team’s, has dropped to levels that were unthinkable during his 22-goal season in 2016-17. Ex-Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane, speaking on Sky Sports in late October, was scathing. “He’s an example to young footballers out there,” he said, “You take your eye off the ball, you lose that hunger. And when you lose that hunger it’s hard to get it back. He thought he was a player, he thought he’d achieved something.”</p>
      <p>Keane's former team-mate Gary Neville, who has worked with Alli for the England national team, replied, “I thought Dele Alli was a young Roy Keane in terms of his mentality. He seemed to have all the qualities you would want in a football player. Aggressive, box-to-box, could score a goal, was nasty.” And that last point - in the past tense, it must be noted - is the most pertinent.</p>
      <p>Alli was brought in by Pochettino and came on leaps and bounds under his management. In an interview with the Premier League TV on Thursday, Alli said of his former manager, “I think it's clear that our relationship was more than just football. He's someone that meant a lot to me, and to a lot of the players - because when you speak to him, it wasn't just about football things, it was about life stuff as well.”</p>
      <p>But things can get too nice, too comfortable. High level athletes, whatever the sport, need an edge. And when Alli was at his best, he was nasty. Not in the sense that he was an unpleasant man off the field, more that he enjoyed confrontation on it; that he’d constantly played on or very near the edge. He’d tussle with opposition players off the ball, kick them after they’d released possession and try every trick in the book to get under their skin.</p>

      <p>That ferocious streak would sometimes get him in trouble, and countless pundits and ex-players lined up to pronounce that the aggression was something Alli needed to eradicate from his game. They couldn’t have been more wrong. Over the last 12 months we have seen a more passive Alli and that lack of devilment has come hand-in-hand with a downturn in productivity.</p>
      <p>So, enter Mourinho, stage left. He might be “relaxed”, as he told the media on Thursday, but he will not, as he continued, “lose his DNA”. In other words: in the pursuit of victory, anything goes. Alli may not see José as a father figure like he did with Pochettino, Mourinho might even tell him a few things he doesn't want to hear, but that could prove to be what he needs to get back to his best.</p>
      <p>Against Everton three weeks ago, there was a little glimpse of nasty Dele, when after scoring he lay on the floor in a celebration aimed at the growing chorus of critics. With José in charge at Spurs, there’s a fair chance we’ll see more of him. And Tottenham's London derby against West Ham on Saturday would be a pretty good place to start.</p>
