      <p>The creative team at Media Molecule have built something truly special in <i>Dreams</i>, a game where anyone can make their own game and share it with others, and at the <a href="https://gdconf.com/?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-22-gdc20">Game Developers Conference</a> in March they'll share a rare look under the hood that you won't want to miss!</p>
      <p>That's because the code driving <i>Dreams </i>is custom-built to its unique demands, and in a special <a href="https://gdconf.com/conference/game-programming?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-22-gdc20">Programming track</a> talk on <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-architecture-of-dreams/868814?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-22-gdc20">The Architecture of '<i>Dreams</i>'</a> Media Molecule's Liam de Valmency will walk you through exactly how it all works.</p>
      <p>Check out this talk and you'll enjoy a tour through the current <i>Dreams</i> code base, highlighting useful code patterns, tricks, and systems that have allowed the game to be shipped in a stable form, while still allowing for flexibility and iteration in response to the changing needs of <i>Dreams</i> players.</p>
      <p>Marvel at previous iterations of the game's code; thrill to the sight of how the code has been designed to support a broad range of user-generated content; you'll pay for a whole seat, but when you find out how the programming team have adapted their processes throughout <i>Dreams</i>' development, you'll only be using the edge!</p>
