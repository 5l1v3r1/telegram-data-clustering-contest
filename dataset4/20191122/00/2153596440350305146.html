      <h1>These are the worst accident hot-spots in Johannesburg</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The City of Johannesburg and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) have published a list of the worst accident hotspots in the city.</p>
      <p>The list is based on data collected by the JMPD between July and October 2019, in which it recorded 179 crashes which led to 192 fatalities.</p>
      <p>The data excludes serious accidents where the injured may have succumbed to their injuries within days in hospital, so the number may differ in national reporting.</p>

      <p>Recent data published by the World Health Organisation shows that South Africa ranks among the worst countries in the world for road safety, with over 25 mortalities per 100,000 population due to road incidents.</p>
      <p>More specifically, the WHO’s report on road safety shows that South Africa ranks around 40th in the world for its high number of road deaths, estimated at 14,500 deaths in 2018, representing a mortality rate of 25.9 people per 100,000 population.</p>
      <p>The WHO rates South Africa’s laws targeting poor driving as inadequate, including drunk driving laws, speeding laws, helmet laws and child safety laws. The only area of law deemed effective is seatbelt laws, it said.</p>
      <p>These are the accident hotspots as identified by the JMPD:</p>
