        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifetime-connections">Lifetime Connections</a>
      </p>
      <p>So many of us want to reject the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/wisdom">wisdom</a> that our mothers or other “older, wiser” folks share with us when we are young. Youth presumes that it outranks life experience when it comes to behavioral choices and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making">decision-making</a>. If you’re engaging in the practices described below, you are doing the things you need to do for a happy, healthy life.</p>
      <h4>Brush Your Teeth Every Day</h4>
      <p>By brushing your teeth, you are possibly staving off the onset of Alzheimer’s disease as periodontal disease has been linked to this illness. In addition, there are connections between healthy teeth and gums and cardiovascular health. Brushing your teeth doesn’t just freshen your breath, it also provides some protection against devastating diseases.</p>
      <h4>Get a Good Night’s Sleep Every Night (Preferably in a Cool, Darkened Room)</h4>
      <p>A lack of sleep can result in significantly increased levels of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a>. The lack of sleep affects the part of the brain that controls <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> and this means that stressing out about the lack of sleep is only magnified by the actual harm done by inadequate sleep. Not only will a lack of sleep have detrimental effects, so too can exposure to artificial light. It turns out that artificial light – either the kind given off by a lamp or a television screen – can wreak havoc on your body even as you slumber. Research shows that exposure to artificial light while you sleep can result in weight gain and increased risk for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/obesity">obesity</a>. The neurochemicals that do their work while we’re sleeping are apparently affected by light and this can cause problems for your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/hormones">endocrine</a> system.</p>
      <h4>Eat Your Veggies and Fresh Fruit</h4>
      <p>Nutritional <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, which explores the link between <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">diet</a> and mental health, suggests that what we eat plays a significant role in how we feel. Healthy eating makes for a healthy emotional state and a healthy body. Fresh fruits and veggies offer protection from anxiety and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>. Getting the right nutrients can also guard against <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a>, which can kick in right about now.</p>
      <h4>Don’t Wish your Time Away</h4>
      <p>Take time to breathe. It’s important to take time to breathe deeply and intentionally—breath is the key to life and learning to master your breathing can help you maintain overall good physical health and emotional health, too. Calming yourself through long, slow, deep breaths is a great practice to master so that you can master the daily frustrations and irritations that can raise your blood pressure and cloud your thinking.</p>
      <h4>Go Outside and Play</h4>
      <p>Being outdoors offers a variety of health benefits both mental and physical (Twohig-Bennette &amp; Jones, 2018). Exposure to green space is linked to lower blood pressure, lowered cortisol levels which is the stress hormone, and lower heart rate. It was also connected to decreased risks of diabetes and cardiovascular death. Keep moving and walk instead of ride, stretch and bend instead of standing still. Regarding mental health, when we are outdoors, our minds can begin to de-stress and let the clutter of the day drift away. Exposure to sunshine can boost our mood and has been found to enhance our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a>; it also has been found to enhance memory and decrease depression in some populations (Riemersma-van der Lik et al., 2008). Playing outside really is good for us for many reasons.</p>
      <h4>Stop Slouching and Stand up Straight</h4>
      <p>Standing up straight and sitting up straight can play a significant role in the amount of stress and strain you place on your spine and help you avoid headaches and backaches. Our bodies function best when alignment of our bones is supported by our posture and good posture keeps our bones strong—there’s less wear-and-tear on joints. Not only that, but energy levels are higher when we keep our bones and muscles in alignment because we’ve got our muscles prepped and ready to do what we’re going to be asking them to do. Erect posture also gives our lungs more room to expand which makes deep, full breaths much easier to achieve. Not only do we come across as more intentional and in charge when our posture is aligned, but our bodies actually allow us to function more effectively and powerfully. We feel stronger when we stand up straight.</p>
      <h4>Give Us a Hug!</h4>
      <p>Skin contact is essential for our overall well being—researchers have shown that “skin hunger” actually does exist. When we are touched in a caring, non-sexual manner, such as through a hug, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/oxytocin">oxytocin</a> production amps up. This hormone creates a “natural high” that encourages trust, somewhat “dissolves” <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory">short-term memory</a>, and simply makes you feel good all over. Not only that, but researchers have discovered that when oxytocin courses through the body, it speeds the physical healing of wounds. It also helps the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment">bonding</a> process and supports social connections. A caring embrace or a pat on the shoulder can truly make you feel better, help your immune system, and warm your heart.</p>
      <h4>Kiss your Partner Every Day</h4>
      <p>Don’t forget to take care of your love life, either—making time for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/relationships">intimacy</a> and sexual union with your partner can make your life a whole lot better. A healthy <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sex</a> life has been found to be related to a better memory and healthier cognitive functioning as well as increased wellbeing, especially as people age. In a longitudinal study of adults 50 and over, it was found that engagement in sexual activity was a significant predictor of enjoyment of life (Smith, Yang, Veronese, et al., 2019).</p>
