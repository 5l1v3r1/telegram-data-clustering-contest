      <h1>Catalytic converter thefts up tenfold in 2019</h1>

      <p>The number of claims for catalytic converter thefts has increased tenfold from the beginning of the year, says AA insurance services.</p>
      <p>In January, the insurance company recorded eight catalytic converter thefts. That figure has leapt to 79 in the month of October.</p>
      <p>A few vehicles have had their catalytic converter stolen twice, meaning the owner has had to make two separate insurance claims.</p>
      <p>Janet Connor, managing director for AA insurance services says; “Criminals are being bold and brash by stealing converters in broad daylight, as they believe passers-by won’t question someone tinkering underneath a car.</p>
      <p>“Where possible, drivers should park in a garage or in a well-lit area. Manufacturers have also developed anti-theft devices, which can be attached to the fixings and give the converter a unique serial number. Concerned drivers should contact their dealer for further information.</p>
      <p>“Scrap dealers and online auction sites have a role to play too, by making appropriate checks to ensure the parts being sold or scrapped have not been illegally gained.”</p>
      <p>Although catalytic converter thefts represent a very small proportion of all insurance claims made, the number of claims has steadily increased since January 2018.</p>
      <p>Catalytic converters contain precious metals such as palladium, rhodium and platinum and can either be sent for scrap or sold privately via online auction sites.</p>
      <p>As the converter is either unscrewed or sawn off the car, other damage can occur, such as cutting through electrical wires. This means repair bills can be around £2,000 to £3,000.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/manufacturer-news/2019/11/19/rapid-rise-in-catalytic-converter-thefts">Police forces across the UK have recognised the increase in crime and have highlighted that hybrid vehicles are of particular interest to thieves.</a>
