      <p>It is almost a moot point who is the favorite to win the Copa Libertadores final on Saturday in Lima and lift South America’s most coveted trophy, and yet, by general consensus, reigning champion River Plate will be the underdog. There are arguments on both sides. While River Plate is the defending champion, Flamengo is enjoying a stellar season at home. On the back of that domestic supremacy and in part due to the club’s largesse, the Brazilian press and a vast majority of Flamengo’s fan base consider the Rio club the favorite to conquer the Copa Libertadores.Under the command of Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus Flamengo has been transformed into a swashbuckling team that towers over the Brazilian league, but can that domestic dominance be translated into continental superiority? With Benfica, Jesus lost two continental finals: the 2013 Europa League final against Chelsea and the same competition a year later against Sevilla. </p>
      <p>The reigning South American champion has pedigree and experience in the Copa Libertadores. Last season, River Plate defeated Buenos Aires sibling and arch rival Boca Juniors in the ‘final to end all finals’ after Conmebol shifted the game to the Spanish capital Madrid over security concerns in the Argentinean capital. The team of Marcelo Gallardo prevailed in extra time and this weekend’s final represents an unique chance to defend its title, a feat no South American team has achieved since Boca Juniors in 2001.</p>
      <p>First, River Plate will need to defend well. Flamengo has scored 73 goals in 34 matches in the Brazilian league and demolished Gremio 5-0 in the semi-final second leg of the competition. The Brazilians attack from every angle. In essence, Jesus fields eight attack-minded players, who combine to devastating effect. River Plate’s defense holds up well, having conceded just eight goals in the Copa Libertadores. </p>
      <p>Lucas Martinez Quarta is a quality central defender, but lacks consistency and alongside him the 36-year-old Javier Pinola can be slow. Holding midfielder Enzo Perez will have a huge burden to protect his defense. The 33-year-old is the heartbeat of the team, enjoying the trust and confidence of coach Gallardo. At the foot of the diamond-shaped midfield, he is the glue that holds the team together and dictates River Plate’s rhythm. The midfielder played from 2011 to 2014 for Benfica and is an old acquaintance of Jesus.</p>

      <p>In River Plates’s 4-1-3-2 formation Perez marshals the build-up play from the back. The Argentinean club channels a lot of its most dangerous attacks through the middle of the field, passing its way past the opponents. The team of Gallardo creates space by dragging opponents out of position, often with players infiltrating in and around the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Further up front, Gallardo will have drawn his own conclusions from Flamengo’s hard-fought 4-4 draw with rivals Vasco da Gama. Vanderlei Luxemburgo deployed two strikers to keep Flamengo’s high defensive line in check, a game plan to which Flamengo didn’t find an immediate response. At River Plate, Matias Suarez and Rafael Santos Borre can occupy similar roles. </p>
      <p>River Plate’s game management is astute, even when Perez is not driving the team forward or screening the defense. The team believes in possession as the best means of defense, but is not shy of inviting opponents into its own half relying on the intelligence of Perez and the movement of Exequiel Palacios further up field. Out of possession, River plays a 4-4-2 formation that is hard to break down. </p>
      <p>On Friday evening, Gallardo said in his news conference that he is all for the spectacle and he backed those words up by revealing his regular formation without reverting to a back five as the Argentinean press had suggested. The River Plate coach reminded everyone that River Plate is the reigning champion and that, as he rightly pointed out, has got to count for something. </p>
