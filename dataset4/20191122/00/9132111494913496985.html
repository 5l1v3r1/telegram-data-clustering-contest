      <p>The 2012 presidential candidate of the NPP, Akufo-Addo was accused of strangely excluding from his Curriculum Vitae, his details from Oxford University. His action according to the NDC’s, Tsatsu Tsikata, casts a slur on his integrity.</p>
      <p>According to the former Chief Executive of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Tsatsu Tsikata, there were rumours about Nana Addo’s dismissal from the Oxford University.</p>

      <p>A leading member of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) is claiming that the presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Nana Akufo-Addo was a student at the Oxford University in London.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tsatsu Tsikata said the manner in which the NPP flagbearer and his cohorts have dealt with the Oxford University question casts a slur on his [Nana Addo's] integrity.</p>
      <p>He was speaking on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen programme on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The NPP presidential candidate has been accused of deliberately excluding from his Curriculum Vitae, his attendance of Oxford University.</p>
      <p>According to the pro-NDC group, Research and Advocacy Platform (RAP), the NPP presidential candidate has compromised his integrity by concealing such vital information.</p>
      <p>The group says it has written to authorizes at Oxford University to disclose Akufo-Addo’s details of studentship at the school.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tsatsu Tsikata, speaking on Ekosii Sen said the questions being raised by RAP are legitimate especially when the NPP flagbearer is vying for the highest office of the land.</p>
      <p>He explained that as a fresh student at Oxford in 1969, he heard that Nana Akufo-Addo had left the school under strange circumstance.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tsikata said there were rumours then that Nana Akufo-Addo was dismissed from the university, but could neither deny nor confirm the rumours.</p>
      <p>"There were so many rumours but what ever I will say will be mere speculations," he added.</p>
      <p>Tsatsu Tsikata noted that Nana Addo must not deny the fact that he went to a prestigious University even if it was for a very short period therefore to end the ongoing controversy, he [Nana] must set the records straight.</p>
      <p>He intimated that the attempt to deny or ignore the question and to create the impression that Nana Addo was never a student at Oxford could be detrimental to his presidential ambition.</p>
      <p>Tsatsu Tsikata said there will be too many doubts in the minds of Ghanaians if Nana Akufo-Addo does not come clean on the matter.</p>
