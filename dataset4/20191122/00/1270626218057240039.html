      <p>The Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission will now fix and declare the fares and charges for the use of public service vehicles.</p>
      <p>The Land Transport Amendment Bill 2019 was passed in Parliament today.</p>
      <p>While speaking on the Bill, Attorney General, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum says establishing a fare structure for public service vehicles is a complex exercise and takes into account various factors including the ever-fluctuating price of fuel and inflation.</p>
      <p>He says to conduct a fair, comprehensive and regular fare review process requires the expertise of a variety of fields including economics, market regulation, financial systems and auditing of accounts.</p>
      <p>Sayed-Khaiyum says the LTA does not has the capacity or expertise to comprehensively undertake this exercise and LTA is more focused on Land Transport regulation.</p>
