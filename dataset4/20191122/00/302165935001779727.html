      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 22 — Companion games <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Pokémon Shield</i> have sold six million copies worldwide during their first week on sale, The Pokémon Company has revealed, confirming its status as the console’s fastest seller.</p>
      <p>Released on November 15 as the first core franchise entries on the Nintendo Switch, <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i> is now the console’s fastest-seller to date, Nintendo has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Of the six million copies sold, North America contributed two million, per a separate announcement, while 1.36 million were derived from Japanese sales, according to industry data published by Japan’s <i>Famitsu</i> magazine.</p>
      <p>In both Japan and the UK, <i>Sword and Shield</i> were already understood to be the console’s fastest sellers in terms of three-day sales, according to earlier reports.</p>
      <p>The games, which are functionally identical with a small number of creatures and characters exclusive to each, have overtaken <i>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</i> to take the Nintendo Switch’s first-week crown.</p>
      <p><i>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</i> shifted 5fivemillion copies over the course of its first seven days.</p>
      <p>It would appear, by virtue of omission, that <i>Sword and Shield</i> did not manage to surpass predecessors <i>Pokémon Sun and Moon</i>.</p>
      <p>In the lead up to release, some sections of the series’ fanbase expressed disappointment with game features — specifically the atypical absence of some Pokémon creatures introduced in previous games — while the games’ reception at review was not quite at the same level of acclaim as <i>Sun and Moon</i>.</p>
      <p>In addition, when <i>Pokémon Sun and Moon</i> launched in November 2016 for the portable Nintendo 3DS, 61 million 3DS consoles had been shipped to retail worldwide, according to Nintendo’s own figures; by contrast, at the time of the <i>Sword and Shield</i> launch, Nintendo had shipped 41m Switch units internationally.</p>
      <p>Yet as <i>Sword and Shield</i> generate more revenue than <i>Sun and Moon</i>, thanks to differences in average retail prices, the console manufacturer and Pokémon Company partner may not be too worried in the short term. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
