      <p>As massive new streaming services roll out, Netflix continues to announce high-profile projects for its audience. The latest: a TV series version of <i>Chinatown</i>. Pairing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/robert_towne">Robert Towne</a>, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of the 1974 movie, with Golden Globe winner/Oscar nominee <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/david_fincher">David Fincher</a>, Netflix wants a prequel series that will focus on the young Jake Gittes, the private investigator played by <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jack_nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> in the movie.</p>
      <p>The series would unfold Gittes’ experiences with the wealthy, and often corrupt, power players in early 20th century Los Angeles, including the leaders in businesses like land, oil, and organized crime.</p>
      <p>Towne will write the script for a pilot, and though it’s not currently part of the deal, Deadline reports Netflix hopes Fincher, who will be an executive producer on the project along with Towne and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/josh_donen">Josh Donen</a>, will also direct the series pilot.</p>
      <p>The prequel is not the first follow-up to the movie. In 1990, Nicholson starred in and directed a <i>Chinatown</i> movie sequel, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_two_jakes"><i>The Two Jakes</i></a>, with a script by Towne. The film was a box office flop, though, and plans for a third movie, the final in the Jake Gittes trilogy, were abandoned.

      <p>Speaking of Netflix, the streaming giant has also ordered <i>Vikings: Valhalla</i>, a sequel series to History’s <i>Vikings</i>. <i>Vikings</i> creator <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/michael_hirst">Michael Hirst</a> is co-creating <i>Valhalla</i>, which will be set 100 years after the History series, and focus on the adventures of Leif Erikson, Freydis, and Viking descendant William the Conqueror, among others. History’s <i>Vikings</i> returns for its sixth and final season with a two-hour premiere on Wednesday, December 4 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p>

      <p>It hasn’t been tough to find <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/kevin_hart">Kevin Hart</a> in the news or on — you guessed it — Netflix in the last year, and now the comedian will cover both bases with a new Netflix docuseries, <i>Don’t F–k This Up</i>, which will follow him as he works on his personal life as a husband and father, and continues to build his career, even amidst controversies like quitting his job as Oscar host in December 2018 after some homophobic comments he made on social media years earlier came to light again.</p>
      <p>Hart, who has starred in comedy specials <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kevin_hart_irresponsible"><i>Kevin Hart: Irresponsible</i></a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kevin_harts_guide_to_black_history"><i>Kevin Hart’s Guide to Black History Himself</i></a> on Netflix this year, has not confirmed whether or not the six-episode series will also cover the September 2019 car crash that left him with a fractured spine. The series will premiere on Netflix on December 27, and will include interviews with his friends and family, stand-up footage, and childhood videos.</p>
