      <h1>Tesla ATV: Elon Musk’s ‘One More Thing’ Is an ATV That Fits In Cybertruck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John Koetsier</a></address>
      <p>Tesla founder Elon Musk pulled a trick out of Steve Jobs’ playbook today.At the Tesla Cybertruck event tonight, Elon Musk unveiled the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-is-ugly-as-sin-there-i-said-it/">futuristic Blade Runner-like pickup truck</a>.</p>
      <p>It has autopilot included standard, Musk said, a 17” touchscreen, 3,500 pounds of payload capacity, goes from zero to 60 MPH in just 2.9 seconds, and has an adjustable air suspension. In addition, the triple-motor version has “a towing capability of over 14,000 pounds,” Tesla says.</p>

      <p>But at the end of the show, Musk hesitated, then said he had “one more thing.” That was Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ signature move: unveil something amazing, then drop one more gem on the audience.</p>
      <p>That gem turned out to be an all-electric ATV.</p>
      <p>“We also made an ATV,” Elon Musk said.</p>

      <p>The ATV, which Musk gave few details about, looks almost as futuristic as the truck, and not only fits in Cybertruck’s cargo area, it also charges from Cybertruck’s big batteries.</p>
      <p>In addition, Cybertruck has a built-in ramp that unfolds and extends from the truck’s tailgate, allowing owners to simply ride right up into the cargo area without any other hardware.</p>
      <p>That’s impressive.</p>
      <p>Road vehicles have been designed and built with electric propulsion for almost a decade now, but off-road vehicles and recreational vehicles for traditional motorsports have been slow to follow.</p>

      <p>There are available models from manufacturers such as Polaris, which makes a 30 horsepower electric utility vehicle, as well as options from relatively new companies such as the New York-based EVS and Oregon’s Barefoot Motors.</p>
      <p>With massive battery manufacturing capability and probably unmatched EV engineering capability, Tesla wants a piece of this market – and probably a big piece.</p>
      <p>And, like it has done with electric cars, Tesla clearly intends to accelerate the adoption of electric motors for vehicles we play in (and on) as well as commute in.</p>
      <p>One problem: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/11/22/tesla-demo-fail-transparent-metal-armored-glass-smashed-during-cybertruck-reveal/">Cybertruck’s “armored glass” shattered in on-stage demo</a>.</p>
