      <p>The Director of Elections for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Elvis Afriyie Ankrah, says elements within the party that made u-turn after backing the ‘YES’ campaign in the December 17, Referendum, are wise.</p>
      <p>He said such people made a good decision by withdrawing from their initial stance after getting absolute clarity on the fundamental flaws with the bill concerning MMDCE elections.</p>
      <p>Kumbungu MP, Ras Mubarak who openly broke ranks within the NDC quickly made a sharp u-turn and apologized for defying the orders of his party.</p>
      <p>“After a detailed discussion of the merits of the issues with leadership, I am convinced that a “NO” vote in this referendum on the current amendment is the way to go,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>His party(NDC) has maintained among other concerns that introducing partisan politics to the assemblies would expose the assemblies to the dangers of national politics.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the development on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.5 FM, Mr. Elvis Afriyie Ankrah said those people accused of hypocrisy after backtracking their earlier stance are rather thinking positive for the future of the country.</p>
      <p>“If you’re going to Ho, and suddenly you find yourself on the road to Sogakokpe, what you have to do is to quickly turn and get on the right road.</p>
      <p>“Our partisan politics is headed in the wrong direction and its a wrong move to introduce the same risks of our national politics at the local level. Just look at what happened at the Ghana Health Service(GHS) recently. We must take a cue from this. It's very sad that a President will make an appointment, and later he could be forced to cancel it because party members think otherwise.</p>
      <p>“I even hear now there is an NPP wing at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital(KATH). What at all is going on? I believe the position taken by the NDC is to cure serious governmental, legal and security issues.”</p>
