      <p><b><i>The Duke of York’s decision comes following days of turmoil that has damaged the UK royal family’s reputation; the prince also loses his £249,000 allowance from the queen<br/></i></b><br/>Britain's Prince Andrew was forced to withdraw from public duties and give up his £249,000 (about Rs 2.31 crore) annual allowance over his friendship with the convicted US paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, UK's Daily Mirror has reported. <br/><br/>Andrew, 59, had an emergency meeting with Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday where he issued a grovelling apology for heaping shame on the royal family. A senior Palace source confirmed the Duke of York had vowed to "not return to public life until the Epstein case is closed or he has cleared his name", the tabloid said. <br/><br/>Prince Charles was consulted on the move and agreed it was the right decision after Andrew's car-crash BBC interview on Saturday. Sources confirmed Andrew will cease to receive £249,000 of taxpayers' money from the Sovereign Grant used to pay for his office, the paper said. <br/><br/>He will now have to rely on handouts from his mother from her Duchy of Lancaster money which made £21million in profits last year. <br/><br/>In the BBC interview, Andrew denied having sex with a woman who says she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17. But the prince failed to express any sympathy for Epstein's victims, and also defended his previous friendship with Epstein because of the contacts it provided when he was preparing for a role as Britain's special trade representative. <br/><br/><b>'He must talk to US prosecutors' <br/></b><br/>Meanwhile, lawyers for the victims of Epstein say Andrew should speak to US investigators immediately, after the senior British royal withdrew from public duties over what he called his "ill-judged association"' with him. <br/><br/>American attorney Gloria Allred said Andrew should contact the US authorities "without conditions and without delay." <br/><br/>Andrew announced on Wednesday that he was pulling out of public duties "for the foreseeable future" amid a firestorm of criticism over his friendship with Epstein. In a statement, he said he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required." Allred said the prince needed to be clearer. "Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so?" she asked on the BBC. <br/><br/>It is not clear if US authorities are investigating Andrew for any possible wrongdoing. Many of the court papers related to the Epstein case are still sealed and unavailable to the public. Lisa Bloom, Allred's daughter and another lawyer for Epstein's victims, tweeted that Andrew "and his staff must cooperate with all investigations, show up for civil depositions and trials. , and produce all documents." <br/><br/><b>Biggest challenge for Britain’s monarchy since Diana’s death<br/></b><br/>The scandal has bloomed into the biggest challenge for Britain’s monarchy since the 1997 death of Princess Diana, when Queen Elizabeth II was accused of appearing aloof and out of touch amid an outpouring of national mourning for the popular royal with the common touch. <br/><br/>Prince Andrew’s decision to withdraw from public life – unprecedented for a royal in recent decades – came after he consulted his mother, the 93- year-old monarch. <br/><br/>Andrew is the queen’s third child and second son. His older brother, Prince Charles, is heir to the throne but Andrew is eighth in line, after Charles’s sons and grandchildren. <br/><br/>On the official royal website, Andrew was listed as a patron or involved in dozens of charitable roles that will now be eliminated as he begins a new phase without royal duties. <br/><br/><br/>Despite Andrew’s announcement on Wednesday, there are still many unanswered questions about his future status. <br/><br/>The British monarch has not commented on Prince Andrew’s his troubles and is not expected to make any public statement. <br/><br/><br/><b><i>- DAILY MIRROR &amp; AGENCIES</i></b></p>
