      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A lapel video shows an Albuquerque police officer accused of running a red light and crashing into a vehicle was streaming YouTube on a laptop before the accident.</p>
      <p>The footage obtained by KOB-TV shows Officer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bryce-willsey/">Bryce Willsey</a> streaming on a department-issued laptop inside the patrol car a clip on how to play a popular video game moments before the December 2017 crash.</p>
      <p>Records show <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bryce-willsey/">Willsey</a>’s patrol car struck a female victim who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The victim later received a $40,000 payout in a settlement with the city of Albuquerque.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bryce-willsey/">Willsey</a> told investigators he saw a green light. But a witness told police he ran a red light.</p>
