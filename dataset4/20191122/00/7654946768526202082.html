      <h1>Food at women’s homeless shelter left me ‘suffering from malnutrition’</h1>

      <p>Rancid milk, moldy bread, rotten fruit, and green eggs — not the Dr. Seuss kind — make up the sickening slop served at women’s homeless shelters across the city, six residents testified at a City Council hearing.</p>
      <p>“The texture is bad, the taste is bad, the appearance is bad. I mean really bad. It’s not something you would want to look at let alone eat,” Phroska M. told council members during a Dept. of Homeless Services oversight hearing Thursday.</p>
      <p>She added that the food is so lousy at the 200-bed Bushwick Homeless Shelter in Brooklyn that she was ordered by her doctor to take an array of supplements.</p>
      <p>“She told me I was suffering from malnutrition,” the septuagenarian recalled.</p>
      <p>Both Phroska and Leslie, a domestic violence survivor and resident of a Project Renewal shelter in Manhattan, testified that apples and oranges were often rotten.</p>
      <p>Janet Perry, 61, said she was served “green eggs” from a supplier called Comfort Foods at the Franklin Women’s shelter in the Bronx.</p>
      <p>And Cece Brown, who’s been in numerous shelters, said “the milk is going bad or is sour,” the bread is moldy, and “mice are seen in the kitchen area running around.”</p>
      <p>Councilman Barry Grodenchik (D-Queens) called the testimony “very disturbing.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Fabienne Laraque, medical director for the Dept. of Homeless Services, said her agency only serves healthy and nutritious foods. She also claimed the chicken <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/shelter-residents-who-ate-rancid-chicken-salad-claim-city-altered-expiration-labels/">that allegedly sickened</a> residents of the Auburn shelter in Brooklyn tested “negative for bacterial pathogens.”</p>
