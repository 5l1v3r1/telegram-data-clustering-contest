      <p><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/slick-woods-coachella-style">Slick Woods</a> has revealed via an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5D-xKcnk_l/">Instagram post</a> yesterday that she's currently <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/cancer-hodgkins-lymphoma-chemotherapy">undergoing chemotherapy</a> for <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2017/04/148374/moles-skin-melanoma">stage three cancer</a>.</p>
      <p>The model, best known for <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/09/209442/slick-woods-nyfw-baby-bump-maternity-outfits">appearing in campaigns</a> for Rihanna's brand, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2017/09/170831/fenty-beauty-rihanna">Fenty</a>, disclosed the news by posting a photo on Instagram<b> </b>of her sticking her tongue out with her friends in the background, captioned, "How I feel about chemotherapy, shout out to everyone that gotta go through it #AtLeastImAlreadyBald".</p>
      <p>Soon after Woods posted the photo, Instagram account the Shade Room <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5HOeZyB025/">shared an exclusive</a> from the model, revealing that she's battling stage 3 melanoma and that the cancer is spreading. She told the account that she’s currently fighting for her life.</p>
      <p>After the post, comments came pouring in from celebs like <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/221960/taraji-p-henson-ageism-in-hollywood">Taraji P. Henson</a>, who said, “You are already on the other side of this healthy and strong like it never happened. I adore you🙌🏾🙏🏾💋💋💋.” Lala Anthony also voiced her support, writing “love u sis ❤️" on the photo.</p>
      <p>The Shade Room also voiced <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2017/06/158111/multiple-best-friends-benefits">their own support</a> for the model, saying, "At this time, we continue to pray for Slick’s health and that she’ll beat this disease. Her good spirit and will to fight is a testament to her strength and she’s certainly not alone in this fight given the outpouring of love and support from friends and fans all over the world. Keep fighting, Slick!"</p>
      <p>Woods rose to fame back in 2017 when Rihanna featured her as a model in her Fenty beauty campaign — <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/209965/slick-woods-gives-birth-baby-saphir-adonis-bosso">she also famously went into labour</a> during the first-ever Savage x Fenty show back in 2018. This is the first time Woods has confirmed her illness to the public.</p>
      <p>In a follow-up Instagram, Woods <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5GK7eVHu4q/">posted a photo</a> of her one-year-old son, Saphir, making a grouchy face, captioned, "Stop treating me like a victim". As she's proven before, Woods is anything but.</p>
