      <p><b>Cabot Microelectronics (NASDAQ: CCMP)</b>, a supplier of polishing slurries and polishing pads used in the semiconductor industry, has seen its stock rally by over 40% this year to about $135. There are multiple factors driving the increase. While the semiconductor market has seen headwinds over the last year or so, on account of lower pricing and tepid demand, there have been some signs that things could stabilize. Moreover, demand for the company’s consumables could rise in the interim, driven by higher semiconductor content and more complex chips coming in with the advent of technologies such as <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4292315-cabot-microelectronics-ccmp-presents-seaport-globals-annual-chemicals-and-basic-materials"><b>5G and AI</b></a>. Separately, in late 2018, the company closed a deal to buy KMG Chemicals, a company that sells specialty chemicals for various sectors, including the semiconductor industry. The deal should allow Cabott to bolster its product portfolio and increase its geographic reach.We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review Cabot Microelectronics’ performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
