      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST)</b> —  A 13-year-old boy murdered a teen girl — because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant with his child, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The teen, now 14, admitted in juvenile court to murdering 14-year-old Sylvia McGee, who was shot in the head in March just a block from her home in Canton, Ohio, according to People.</p>
      <p>The killer, who was not identified because of his age, believed the girl was pregnant with his child, prosecutors say — even though the autopsy showed she was not.</p>
      <p>“That is what I believe got this whole thing started,” Assistant Prosecutor Michelle Cordova said, noting McGee was not the boy’s girlfriend, the Canton Repository reported.</p>
      <p>“There was no evidence of any other reason for this,” she said, without giving details of why he believed the girl was pregnant, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Stark County Prosecutor John Ferrero said the evidence all suggested the girl was shot execution-style.</p>
      <p>The killer accepted a plea agreement that brought an aggravated murder charge down to murder, the reports say.</p>
      <p>As part of the plea, he will remain in a youth prison until he is 21.</p>
      <p>If Stark County Family Court Judge Rosemarie Hall deems him a serious youthful offender, he could also face an additional adult prison term of 18 years to life after leaving juvenile detention.</p>
      <p>Sentencing is in January.</p>
