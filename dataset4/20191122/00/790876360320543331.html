          <p><b>1. Use picture books, videos, and stories to help your child understand Halloween.</b> Knowing what will happen makes the holiday less stressful and more fun for autistic kids.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Even older kids may like reminders of the Halloween routine.</li>
            <li>If you have photos from previous Halloweens, bring them out and show your child.</li>
            <li>Talk about how Halloween is different from normally taking candy from strangers, because you are there so they know they are safe.</li>
          </ul>

          <anchor name="step_1_2">
            <p><b>2. Explain the safety and politeness rules of Halloween.</b> Autistic kids may not implicitly understand how to stay safe, so it's best to be clear about the rules. Here are some example rules you may set:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Walking feet in your costume</li>
              <li>Hold hands when crossing the street</li>
              <li>Stay on the neighbor's porch (don't go inside)</li>
              <li>Take only one piece of candy unless the neighbor says you can have more</li>
              <li>Ask for a break if you need it</li>
              <li>You can only eat 3 pieces of candy while trick-or-treating (so they can eat if they're hungry, but don't overeat)</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>

              <p><b>3. Try role-play or a practice run to help them prepare for Halloween.</b> While older kids may know the drill, younger kids or those with intellectual disabilities may need extra help to learn how it works. You can practice using a house, using dolls, or using a door at home. Practice the following steps:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Going up to the door</li>
                <li>Ringing the bell</li>
                <li>Saying "trick or treat!" (if they can)</li>
                <li>Getting a piece of candy</li>
                <li>Saying "thank you!" (or waving or smiling)</li>
                <li>Walking back</li>
              </ul>

                <p><b>4. Plan a comfortable and safe trick-or-treating route.</b> If your child is new to trick-or-treating or tends to struggle with it, then keep your route short with only familiar houses. Stay close to home and figure out what you think your child can handle.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ask neighbors if they plan on putting up strobe lights, using scary decorations, or jumping out and startling children.</li>
                  <li>If your child is afraid of animals, only go to houses that you know have no pets or only have cats. (Dogs tend to bark and run to the door when doorbells are rung.)</li>

Think about whether your child is developmentally ready for trick-or-treating.</b> Smaller kids, kids with intellectual disabilities, and kids who struggle to communicate may not be ready to trick-or-treat. That's okay; there are other ways to have fun. Here are ways to know if your child is ready:</p>
