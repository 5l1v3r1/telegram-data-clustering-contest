      <p>President of the Chamber of Local Governance Dr. Richard Fiadormor says the Akufo-Addo government will be humiliated with its ‘yes vote’ position if it goes ahead with the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>President Akufo-Addo and his NPP party are canvassing for a ‘yes vote’ in the referendum which is to determine if political parties should be allowed to sponsor candidates in local level elections.</p>
      <p>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) and some civil society groups in the country are backing a ‘no vote’ claiming allowing political parties in local polls will further divide the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Friday, Mr. Fiadormor said government should conisder cancelling the referendum.</p>
      <p>“There wouldn’t be any consequence if the referendum is withdrawn.The government will be humiliated if they proceed with the Referendum. The assemblies are bleeding and that is why people say MMDCEs are doing nothing when in fact that may not necessarily be the case,” he said.</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution, which is an entrenched provision, states that “Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character; and sponsor candidates for election to any public office other than the district assemblies or lower local government units”.</p>
