      <h2>The 20 stories are voiced by Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf</h2>

      <p>If your children can’t get enough of Elsa and all things Frozen then from today you can turn to Google to help feed their hunger. To coincide with today’s release of Frozen 2 in cinemas, you can ask your Google Nest Mini or Nest Home (previously branded Google Home) to read a story.</p>
      <p>Simply saying “Hey Google, tell me a Frozen story” will get your smart speaker to read out one of 20 tales voiced by either Elsa, Anna, Kristoff or Olaf.</p>
      <p>If you don’t have a Nest Mini obviously don’t tell the kids they’re missing out, but if you want to surprise them with the Disney/Google collaboration then you can get a Nest Mini for £49. It’s even a product that got a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/google-nest-mini-3776091/">rare five-star review</a> from us here at Tech Advisor. </p>
      <p>You can expect this sort of tie-in to crop up from time to time as Google finds new ways to involve children with smart home gadgets. If you do have one, there are plenty of funny things to ask it to keep your little ones entertained for a few minutes – <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/digital-home/funny-google-assistant-3659188/">we found 150</a>, in fact. </p>
