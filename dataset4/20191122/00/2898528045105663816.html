      <h1>Augusto Sakai signs new six-fight deal with the UFC, calls for top 15 opponent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2252/augusto-sakai">Augusto Sakai</a> wants a top-ranked opponent after inking a new deal with the UFC.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian heavyweight, who stopped <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3542/marcin-tybura">Marcin Tybura</a> in just 59 seconds back in September, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5GhaiLlOS1/">announced</a> the news on his social media. Sakai told MMA Fighting he signed a six-fight contract.</p>
      <p>Sakai remains unbeaten in four Octagon appearances, which includes a second-round TKO over Marcos Conrado Jr. at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>’s Contender Series and UFC wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3766/chase-sherman">Chase Sherman</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/423/andrei-arlovski">Andrei Arlovski</a>.</p>
      <p>Sakai was hoping to replace <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1436/walter-walt-harris">Walt Harris</a> against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/32/alistair-overeem">Alistair Overeem</a> in the main event of UFC on ESPN 7 in Washington, DC, on Dec. 7, but <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5156/jairzinho-rozenstruik">Jairzinho Rozenstruik</a> ended up getting the short-notice opportunity.</p>
      <p>With that option no longer available, Sakai wants another big name next.</p>
      <p>“Anyone in the top 15, that’s what I want,” Sakai told MMA Fighting. “I thought they were going to call me to replace Walt Harris against Overeem but they went with Jairzinho, so I'm waiting. Whenever they call me, I'm ready.”</p>
      <p>Sakai (14-1-1) is currently ranked No. 12 in the promotion’s official list after a pair of wins in 2019. The 28-year-old heavyweight has only lost once as a professional fighter, dropping a split decision to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/26/cheick-kongo">Cheick Kongo</a> in his final Bellator appearance in May 2017.</p>
