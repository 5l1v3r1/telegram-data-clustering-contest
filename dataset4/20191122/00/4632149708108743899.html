      <p><i>By TG Shenoy</i> <br/><br/>The year was 1984, a year made famous by George Orwell in his acclaimed novel of the same name. And in that year, 35 years ago – and 35 years after 1984 was first published, a debut novelist called William Gibson published his first book – about the relationship between people and technology, between computers and users, between cyberspace, artificial intelligence, mega-corporations more powerful than governments and the people who inhabit their world – well before computers became popular and years before the world wide web and the first web browser were created. The book was called Neuromancer, and its publication was a watershed moment not just for science fiction but for a whole generation of inventors and artists, and for those to follow. <br/><br/>The term ‘game changer’ is used, overused and abused so often nowadays that it has lost all meaning. But I’d still apply it, in its truest sense to Neuromancer, which upon publication would become a runaway hit, establishing William Gibson as a powerful new voice, prophetic even as many would say, and never going out of print since it first came out. <br/><br/>Neuromancer is the tale of an anti-hero Case, a console cowboy, a cyberspace hacker who more than dabbles in industrial espionage. Caught stealing, he’s punished with incapacitation, leaving him unable to access the virtual reality that is the ‘matrix’, a globally networked dataspace. Suicidal, he soon finds himself lured by a cure and pulled back into his life as a hacker by a mysterious blackmailer and paired with a street samurai called Molly. Remember, this was years before computer hacking was a thing. So begins Case’s mission to cure himself as he and his team engage with mercenaries, powerful AIs, people with cybernetic implants, go up-against powerful businesses or the zaibatsus and the rich and the powerful while trying to stay clear of the Turing Police whose job it is to ensure AIs don’t exceed their pre-set limits. There’s high tech, low life, murder, mayhem, mystery and most of all a thrill-a-page action as Neuromancer hurtles towards the twist at its end, which makes the book not just a good read, but a unique experience to be enjoyed, one that totally blew my little end when I first read it, and continues to do so when I quickly revisit it every so often. The electric prose of Gibson, the ideas that abound within Neuromancer’s pages are truly something everyone should savour at least once in their lifetime. <br/><br/>Looking up Neuromancer will probably tell you a lot of trivia about the book, but that isn’t why you should read it. Don’t read it because it popularised the then-new term ‘cyberspace’, described in the book as a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation (sound familiar?). Don’t read it because it introduced the ideas of a Matrix you can jack into. Don’t read Neuromancer just because it was the first novel won all the big three awards of science fiction: the Hugo award, the Nebula Award, and the Philip K. Dick Award. Don’t read it because it typifies and – in its time codified – the idea of cyberpunk (with Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner providing this sub-genre’s enduring aesthetics). Don’t read it because of its near-mythical status as a beloved classic. Read it for its singular vision and its treatment of people caught up in tech (and vice versa);because it’s one of the finest science fiction novels written thus far. An idea-a-minute rollercoaster of a ride with its fair share of suspense and gritty noir-tinged crime. Read Neuromancer because it’s a darned good read. Happy reading!</p>
