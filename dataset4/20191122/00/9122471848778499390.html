      <h1>CFB Analyst: Alabama Is A Top-4 Team, Even Without Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:02:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, the College Football Playoff selection Committee released its rankings following Week 12 of the college football season.</p>
      <p>Despite two undefeated teams losing last weekend, the top seven programs in the rankings remained the same. LSU held down the top spot, while Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia rounded out the top four.</p>
      <p>Alabama found itself in the No. 5 spot, despite losing star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to a season-ending injury. Tua dislocated his hip and suffered a fracture in the hip as well.</p>
      <p>One college football analyst suggested the Tide are still a top four or five team in the country, even without Tua under center.</p>
      <p>USA Today analyst Danny Sheridan expects Alabama to pick up right where it left off when Tua went down.</p>
      <p>“Alabama is ‘still one of the four or five best teams in the county – even without Tua,'” Sheridan said to Paul Finebaum.</p>

      <p>Backup quarterback Mac Jones has played well this season. He’s completing nearly 70-percent of his passes and has four touchdowns to just one interception on the year.</p>
      <p>However, he hasn’t faced a tough test yet, which he will in the final week of the regular season against Auburn. We won’t learn much this weekend against Western Carolina, but that final game will go a long way to proving or disproving Sheridan’s point.</p>
