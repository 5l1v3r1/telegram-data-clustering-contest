      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday was quoted as saying that the best moment of his young premiership was when the Pakistan Air Force shot down an Indian fighter jet intruding into Pakistani airspace. </p>
      <p>The premier reportedly made the comments while talking to senior journalist Irshad Bhatti, who disclosed the details of his meeting with the premier during an appearance on <i>Geo News </i>programme Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Key Sath. </p>
      <p>Bhatti said that the prime minister had also remarked that the lowest point of his term so far was to witness the persistent persecution of the people of occupied Kashmir by the Indian security forces. </p>
      <p>During the interview, the prime minister also discussed domestic politics, alleging that JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman had been "cutting suspect deals" throughout his political career. </p>
      <p>Dispelling the impression that the government too had "struck a deal", PM Imran said that the Maulana should clarify and tell the nation about the party with which he reached such an agreement. </p>
      <p>The JUI-F chief is talking in an "ambiguous" manner, the prime minister said, adding that he would let the Maulana claim what he wished to.  </p>
      <p>"Fazl kept the people there by offering them money," Bhatti quoted the prime minister as saying, and noted that the staging of a successful sit-in was not a joke as he dared the Maulana to try it again. </p>
      <p>"A leader who abandons his workers in rain and rough weather cannot stage a sit-in," the prime minister reportedly told Bhatti, noting that the Maulana's plan had ran its course and reached point Z.</p>
