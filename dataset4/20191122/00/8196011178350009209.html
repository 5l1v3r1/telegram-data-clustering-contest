      <p>Ireland’s renewable energy ambitions have been given a twin boost by the ESB forming a partnership with Norwegian energy company Equinor to develop offshore windfarms and Greencoat Renewables raising extra funds to build more onshore windfarms.</p>
      <p>The Government is targeting 70% of the country’s electricity generation coming from renewable energy sources — such as wind farms — by 2030. As part of that plan, it wants at least 3.5 gigawatts of offshore wind generating power in place within the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>The ESB and Equinor are looking to bring a number of large-scale wind projects to commercial operation by 2030 and will examine the potential for energy storage technology to complement these wind farms.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the ESB said that it was working to develop a pipeline of projects that would enable it to generate at least 40% of its electricity from renewable, or zero-carbon sources by 2030.</p>
      <p>It said at the time that storage, solar, onshore and offshore wind, waste energy, biomass and gas-fired plants were all included in its plans.</p>
      <p>The ESB spent around €250m on renewable energy projects last year including starting development on two onshore windfarms here. In January, it said it would co-develop two planned offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea in conjunction with Belgian firm Parkwind.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Arklow Bank windfarm, located off the Wicklow coast, is Ireland’s sole functioning offshore windfarm project. The ESB also remains in talks over a renewable energy joint-venture with State-owned forestry company Coillte.</p>
      <p>Greencoat Renewables is to raise around €100m, in a share issuance, to facilitate the purchase of more onshore windfarms in Ireland and continental Europe. The funding will boost its spend capacity to around €560m.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Greencoat bought the Killala Community windfarm in Mayo for more than €37m.</p>
