      <p><b>Dwarzon, Margibi County –</b> The charity group, ‘Women of Substance of the Delaware Valley International Incorporated’ has awarded scholarships to 20 needy female students in Montserrado and Margibi Counties.</p>
      <p>The group’s President, Laura Doe Dixon, speaking at the official launch of the organization’s “No Girls Left Behind and the selection of the first 20 cohorts” program said the gesture is to help needy students get a quality education for a bright future.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Dixon said Women of Substance is a 501 (C3) non-profit organization registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States and in Monrovia, Liberia respectively.</p>
      <p>According to her, the organization, as part of its initiatives, provides mentoring, charitable and voluntary services to residents of Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>In addition, the group sponsors a special student with a GPA of 3.5 selected by her school to a Prom of her lifetime. It also distributes food to the elderly, and at the beginning of each school year distribute school supplies to needy children of the community.</p>
      <p> “As an organization, comprising of 32 Liberians residing in the Delaware Valley, United States, we recognize that education is the key to the development of any community, and as such, we would like to be a part of that development in our beloved country,” she said.</p>
      <p>Speaking further, she said the first step in operationalizing the group’s desire was to register in Liberia and then raise the funds needed for the “No Girls Left Behind” initiative for Liberia.</p>

      <p>The initiative, she added is intended to help needy students with scholarship to stay in school for a year, while continuous support after the first year is dependent upon the review of the students’ attendance record and scholastic performance. </p>
      <p>She thanked guests including parents, school administrators and members of the organization that accompanied her to Liberia and called for everyone’s support to the initiative.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Hawa Jalloh, a young advocate who served as the guest speaker of the program encouraged young girls to prioritize education.</p>
      <p>She called for a conducive learning environment for the students and protection of children, especially young girls against all forms of sexual and gender-based violence.</p>
      <p>She thanked the organization for the support and called on parents to ensure the children take their lesson seriously to maintain the scholarship.</p>
      <p>Miss Jalloh symbolically served as the Deputy Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, as part of the Ministry of Gender’s initiative to promote girls’ self-confidence and mentoring girls to take up leadership role.</p>
      <p>For his part, the Principal of the Howard Christian School of Science &amp; Technology, Nathaniel Sarvice, thanked the organization for the initiative and pledged his school’s support.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the students are expected to be chosen from the Howard Christian School of Science &amp; Technology in Dwarzon and the Mother Zealmon James Academy in Brewerville, Montserrado County.</p>
