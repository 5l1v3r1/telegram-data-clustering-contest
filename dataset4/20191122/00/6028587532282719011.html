      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/western-digital/"><b>Western Digital</b></a> (NASDAQ: WDC) has seen a steady growth in number of hard disk exabytes sold over the past 5 years, rising from 249 EB in 2015 to 383 EB in 2019, a growth of over 50%. (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) Over the same period, Western Digital’s hard disk drive revenue has dropped from $13.65 billion to $8.75 billion, a drop of over 35%.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Why did this happen?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>WDC has seen a drop in HDD units sold, dropping from 228.7 million in 2015 to 120 million in 2019.</li>
        <li>This is largely due to a drop in retail demand, with people preferring cloud storage and streaming services over physical memory.</li>
        <li>Also, the price per TB has dropped from $54.82 to $22.85 over the same period, as memory devices sold now have 3-4 times the amount of storage space, as compared to devices back in 2015.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>What does this mean?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retail consumers are gradually moving toward streaming and cloud services, and this is bound to negatively affect Western Digital’s hard drive revenue going forward as well.</li>
        <li>The number of exabytes sold might still consistently go up, as people’s data storage needs keep growing with time, and a 500GB hard drive that was the standard in 2015, has been replaced by 1TB and 2TB hard drives.</li>
        <li>However, this is not a clear indicator of growth, as number of HDD units sold are consistently dropping, and devices with higher base storage space are also driving down the cost per bit.</li>
        <li>With these factors in mind, we don’t see a direct correlation between exabytes shipped and HDD revenues anytime soon.</li>
      </ul>
