      <p>Chevrolet brought back its Trailblazer SUV at the ongoing LA Auto Show, after a hiatus of more than a decade. The American carmaker revived the car with modern aesthetics and mechanical upgrades and will place it between the Trax and the Equinox SUVs.</p>
      <p>The new Trailblazer borrows many design elements from other SUVs in its family, including the signature dual-port grille. The grille also gets a bigger opening in the ACTIV trim, and a mesh grille with front-splitters in the RS trim. The Trailblazer also gets wraparound taillights and two-tone roof as standard.</p>
      <p>Chevrolet has also updated the Trailblazer with its latest touchscreen infotainment system with phone app connectivity. The SUV also gets a centre console with 3.5-litres of open storage, along with 4.4-litres of storage under the armrest, and dual cup holders. The Trailblazer also features 40/60 split-folding second-row seats.</p>
      <p>The Trailblazer is offered with the options of a 1.2-litre and 1.3-litre turbocharged petrol engine. Both the engines are mated to a CVT gearbox as standard, which sends power to the front wheels. However, the bigger engine option also comes with AWD and a 9-speed automatic transmission. Chevrolet is also offering Normal, Snow and Sport driving modes with the front-wheel-drive trims.</p>
      <p>The company is expected to launch the Trailblazer in the international market by 2020, with an estimated price tag of Rs 14.35 lakh (ex-showroom, when converted). Chevrolet is yet to officially announce if the SUV will make its way to Indian shores.</p>
