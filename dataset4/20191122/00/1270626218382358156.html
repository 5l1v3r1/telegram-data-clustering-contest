      <p>Jale Baba has changed his plea from not guilty to guilty in the Suva Magistrates Court.</p>
      <p>Baba has pleaded guilty to publishing falsified Voter Lists and other false information related to that list on Facebook last year, which he knew was untrue. </p>
      <p>He had denied the charge in August but had later indicated to the court through his counsel that he wanted to change his plea. </p>
      <p>The matter has been adjourned to the 6th of January next year.</p>
