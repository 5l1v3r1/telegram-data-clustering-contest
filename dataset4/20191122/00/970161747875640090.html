      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> stars Johannes Radebe and Graziano di Prima brushed off the drama surrounding their same sex dance routine by hanging out together at the Gay Times Honours 500 party.</p>
      <p>The professional dancers performed to Shine by Emeli Sande during a recent results show, and it was a groundbreaking moment for the show.</p>
      <p>However some viewers took issue with it, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/strictly-come-dancing-sex-routine-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-prima-sparks-200-complaints-bbc-11193004/">with 189 viewers complaining about what they had seen.</a></p>
      <p>Both Johannes, who was partnered with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/catherine-tyldesley/">Catherine Tyldesley</a> this series, and Graziano, who didn’t have a celeb partner this year, didn’t look bothered in the slightest and they put their glad rags on and hit the town together.</p>
      <p>The dancers posed for pictures at Magazine London on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Johannes looked effortlessly cool in a dark green suit with a wide-brimmed black hat, a faux fur coat and statement accessories. His fellow dancer looked equally chic in a grey checked suit over a black top.</p>

      <p>At the venue the guys posed with their arms around each other and big smiles on their faces.</p>
      <p>After their emotional performance on Strictly, Graziano <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/graziano-di-prima-praises-special-friendship-johannes-radebe-strictly-come-dancing-sex-routine-11036106/">praised their unique friendship.</a></p>

      <p>Sharing pictures on social media of the pair on and off the dance floor, he said: ‘Our friendship is difficult to explain, we went through so many moments together that we can understand each other without saying a WORD.. ‘As I say to you most of the time: You will be part of my life FOREVER… love you Johannes.’</p>
      <p>Johannes posted a similar sentiment on Instagram with a photo of them standing side-by-side, writing the words, ‘Love knows no boundaries’ alongside it.</p>
      <p>It was a star-studded night with X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, and Glee actor Kevin McHale also on the red carpet.</p>

      <p>Strictly judge Bruno Tonioli recently shared he was ‘upset’ by the fact viewers had complained about two men dancing together.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘It’s hard to believe after such progress in society and many other topics going on that over 200 people felt so upset they complained when 2 men danced with each other… I just don’t know what to say… Very sad. #bbcstrictly.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile their fellow pro Anton Du Beke told Metro.co.uk <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/strictly-come-dancings-anton-du-beke-defends-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-primas-sex-routine-amid-complaints-storm-11195219/">that he didn’t get what the fuss was about.</a></p>
