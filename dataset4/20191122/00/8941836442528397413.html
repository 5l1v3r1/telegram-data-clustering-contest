      <p>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - Wake Forest’s fast-paced offense has slowed down. The Demon Deacons hope to rediscover their rhythm against Duke.</p>
      <p>The Demon Deacons play host to the Blue Devils on Saturday night in the 100th meeting of instate Atlantic Coast Conference rivals who have stumbled into slumps.</p>
      <p>The teams were outscored by a combined 101-9 last week, with Wake Forest (7-3, 3-3) falling to No. 3 Clemson 52-3 before Duke (4-6, 2-4) was routed 49-6 by a Syracuse team that hadn’t won an ACC game all season, a performance that had coach David Cutcliffe saying his team’s effort did not match the Orange’s “and that’s not typical of a Duke football team.”</p>
      <p>“There is nothing easy about it. It’s not easy for anybody in our football world,” Cutcliffe said. “Everybody - everybody - is suffering to some manner.”</p>
      <p>The Demon Deacons have lost two straight to drop from the national rankings while the Blue Devils have dropped four in a row while slipping to the brink of bowl ineligibility. Duke must beat Wake Forest and Miami next week to reach the six-win mark.</p>

      <p>“You have a team that has a chance for a really good season and a special year,” Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson said, “against a team that is fighting for its life.”</p>
      <p>Wake Forest was in that very same position a year ago, needing to beat Duke in the regular-season finale to earn a bowl berth - and wound up routing the Blue Devils 59-7.</p>
      <p>“Embarrassment. They came on our field, put 50-something on us,” Duke defensive end Chris Rumph II said. “We’ve had this marked on our schedule since last year, and we’re coming to practice with a mindset that that’s not going to happen again. We’re going to their house this year.”</p>
      <p>Wake Forest at one point had the ACC’s second-best total offense but slipped to third after its two least productive performances came in the past two weeks - a slide that coincided with a season-ending injury to top receiver Sage Surratt. The Demon Deacons were held to 301 total yards in a 36-17 loss at Virginia Tech, then managed just 105 yards against Clemson.</p>

        <p>They’ll try to get back on track against the Blue Devils, who have allowed a total of 574 yards rushing and 87 points in back-to-back losses to No. 15 Notre Dame and Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Some things to know about the Duke-Wake Forest game:</p>
        <p>STATE CHAMPS?</p>
        <p>The Demon Deacons are trying for their first sweep of the other three instate ACC schools since 2007. It would mark just the eighth time it’s happened in program history.</p>
        <p>REMEMBER NOVEMBER?</p>
        <p>Duke has lost four straight November games - two last season, and two this year - by a combined 181-26. The Blue Devils failed to score more than seven points in any of them.</p>
        <p>BALL INSECURITY</p>
        <p>Turnovers have been telling for both teams, though Wake Forest (11) has been decidedly better with the ball than Duke (24). The Demon Deacons are 0-3 when they turn it over multiple times - but are 7-0 when they give it away no more than once - while Duke has 22 turnovers in its six losses but just two in its four wins.</p>
        <p>THE SERIES</p>
        <p>Duke holds a 58-39-2 record in the series and has won five of the last seven meetings after Wake Forest won 12 in a row from 2000-11. The Blue Devils have not lost in Winston-Salem since 2011 and the home team has not won since Duke’s victory in 2014.</p>
