      <p>Ranking Member for Mines and Energy committee, Adam Mutawakilu has stated that the recent development in the energy sector is a clear indication that the Akufo-Addo government is clueless about how to manage the sector.</p>
      <p>According to him, Staff of the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo) threatened to stage a demonstration over some GHS1.2 billion owed the company by the stakeholder in the energy sector only because government failed to react after several signals were sent. In an interview, the Member of Parliament for Damongo constituency said the failure for government to address the concerns of GRIDCo staff could take us back to dumsor.</p>
      <p>“This government could have been proactive after several signals had been sent. We all know that the Minority sent a signal about the poor nature of the financial of GRIDCO and that if we do not take time, GRIDco will come to a halt. Government did not pay heed, workers in March gave the signal but government did not pay heed to it. On May 1, 2019, placards were out government will not pay heed to it until we got to this stage.”</p>
      <p>“This is clearly a sleeping government that has no clue about the energy sector and it is time we boot them out.” He said He also urged government not to take us back to ‘Dumsor’ after it has been solved by president Mahama</p>
      <p>“President Akufo-Addo should not send us back to dumsor that has been resolved by President Mahama. If the transmission lines are not maintained definitely we would go back to dumsor. We will have transmission problems and there can be trip off. We have experienced it before we had total darkness.”</p>
      <p>"If the moral of the staff is not sound because of frustrations they will not be able to put up their best to ensure that the lights are on,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Staff of the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo) announced they will on Friday, 29 November 2019 stage a demonstration on government to settle over GHS1.2 billion owed the company by ECG, VALCO, PDS and NEDCO.</p>
      <p>At a press conference held earlier this week, the staff also threatened to declare a sit down strike if government fails to meet their demands by December 4, 2019.</p>
      <p>President of the Senior Staff and the Divisional Union of GRIDCo, Raphael Kornor said “We are going to withdraw all emergency services. We are going to treat all emergency services within the normal working hours. In times past GRIDCo staff will be sleeping, they will call you and you will have to wake up. Ladies and Gentlemen we cannot do that again because our efforts are becoming effortless.”</p>
      <p>“From Friday 22nd November 2019, staff will treat all emergency work as normal work within the normal working hours. From Friday 29th November 2019, staff are going to march to ECG office and picket in demand for our money. If by the close of work, Wednesday, December 4, 2019, all these things are not paid, we will declare a sit-down strike. He added.</p>
