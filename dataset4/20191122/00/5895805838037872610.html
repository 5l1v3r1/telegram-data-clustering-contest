      <h2>A repeated lack of reassurance—childhood terrors, festering—shapes brains.</h2>

      </p>
      <p>When we were small and sad and scared, adults could have said <i>It's OK</i>.</p>
      <p>Or <i>It will be OK</i>. Like maybe it's not OK now but wait.</p>
      <p>After we wet ourselves or classmates called us fat, those three- and four-syllable safeguards could have suffused us with strength, faith, grace.</p>
      <p>They could have stopped that sense we had of bouncing down steep mountains, slashed by stones, flailing to save ourselves by seizing reeds that snapped.</p>
      <p>Those words pack power. Someone whose grownupness imports godliness in our eyes proclaims and predicts an end to suffering so we can breathe.</p>
      <p>We can unclench our fingers, haunches, jaws. We can release the toy we clutch as if its fur comprised the only softness in the world. We can open our eyes to see closets unmonstered, sick cats curable, bullies as tiny dots.</p>
      <p>Those grownups could have granted us those magic mini-mercies, such should-have-been-easy insta-orisons, but some did not. They let us bounce down mountains. Boom.</p>
      <p>Was it because they were busy, blasted or gone? Because they thought unbuffered suffering would toughen us? Because why hide the horrible, why lie? Was it because they thought we produced our own pain by sneaking snacks and spacing out and being slobs?</p>
      <p>Or did they never soothe us because <i>their</i> young selves were never soothed in breadlines, blizzards or brightly lit fitting rooms, so they grew up grieving every lost button, picturing each subway car kaleidoscoping bloodily after a crash?</p>

      <p>Sometimes, instead of soothing us, they rubbed it in. Because they found it fun? Because it manifested their omnipotence? Because life was to them truly a hall of horror-mirrors distorting all dialogues and multi-magnifying every bruise?</p>
      <p>Did they not reassure us because they did not know how?</p>
      <p>The lack of reassurance—<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> terrors unabated, festering—<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypervigilance">shapes brains</a>. Biochemical systems, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a>-triggered repeatedly, sensitize the amygdala and elevate the flow of certain chemicals—including cortisol, the stress <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/hormones">hormone</a>—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3968319/">with possibly lifelong effects</a>.</p>
      <p>Bracing ourselves against impending menace whose shattering impact we knew we must bear full-force, alone, we locked our brains and bodies into perma-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">panic</a>, fight-flight-permafreeze.</p>
      <p>We learned to lie awake, mistaking windswept boughs for dagger-twirling burglars. To sit statue-stiff at school, expecting Fs. To starve ourselves, because big bodies are big targets. When kissed, to think: <i>cholera</i>.</p>
      <p>We became hypervigilant.</p>
      <p>Which some of us still are.</p>
      <p>And no, not everything depends on those two tiny incantations. Adults could have soothed us otherwise—with hugs, say. Not that I would know.</p>
      <p>If we feel doomed to spend forever talking ourselves down from ledges no one else can see, if panic is a reflex—instantaneous—if we cannot de-trigger or rewire our poor misshapen brains on command or maybe ever, at all, be kind.</p>
      <p>No need to call us negative. No need to call us numb. No need to call us fun-snuffers. We know. These things you hate about us, we hate more.</p>
      <p>Stop telling us to grow up. Stop calling us scaredycats. Stop saying all our fears are irrational: Sadly, some are not.</p>
      <p>We know that bad things happen in real life, that towers fall. We also know we cannot stop them. No need to remind us that time spent afraid could have been spent <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/laughter">laughing</a>, learning, in love. We know.</p>

      <p>This another of your writings that brings tears to my eyes.<br/>Thank you for writing about issues that some of us don't know how to express.<br/>Yes, I was one of those who was raised by parents that didn't know how to show comfort. In fact they were bullies like the ones at school. If I went to them for comfort, they made it worse by agreeing with the bullies.<br/>I can in hindsight, see that I was raised by the maturity level of fifteen year olds....and they never grew up.<br/>That it is hardwired in me, but I learned to navigate around that.</p>

      <p>Thank you too. Yes, one of the saddest parts about all this is that kids assume adults are ... well, adults. So surely whatever those large powerful people do and say is correct. Kudos for learning to navigate!</p>
