      <p>Every year for the past 10 years, the National Capital Region, comprising about 55,000 square km, chokes at this time of the year because of severe pollution.</p>
      <p>One of the many contributory factors is the burning of paddy stubble.</p>
      <p>Paddy is harvested in early October each year.</p>
      <p>The governments of Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana are trying to persuade farmers not to burn the stubble.</p>
      <p>The farmers are not listening because they don't have an alternative.</p>
      <p>As a result, an impasse has developed.</p>
      <p>The impasse can be broken if the problem is diagnosed.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis is that it's not the burning of stubble but the cultivation of paddy that is the problem.</p>
      <p>Punjab and Haryana are not traditional paddy states because the crop needs a lot of water and they have less of it naturally than, say, south or east India.</p>
      <p>But the two state governments, by making water and electricity free two decades ago, have inadvertently caused the farmers to grow paddy -- around 15 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>This is a case of what economics calls negative externalities.</p>
      <p>Mr A maximises his welfare at the cost of Mr B.</p>
      <p>Mr A's actions constitute a negative externality for Mr B.</p>
      <p>This is what the paddy stubble problem is.</p>
      <p>One way to prevent the cultivation of paddy is to charge for the water and electricity the farmers use.</p>
      <p>But that would reduce their incomes even further.</p>
      <p>In a highly competitive democracy, this is not a practical solution.</p>
      <p>So what's to be done? The Coase Theorem in economics offers a partial solution to the problem of negative externalities.</p>
      <p>It is named after the late Ronald Coase, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for it in 1991.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pay the polluter</b>
      </p>
      <p>The theorem rests on many ifs and buts, but its core message is that if you think it's worth your while, pay your tormentor to stop tormenting.</p>
      <p>This, by the way, was what India and China demanded on a global scale for climate issues.</p>
      <p>The world decided it wasn't worth its while.</p>
      <p>So everyone is worse off now.</p>
      <p>Anyway, to get a sense of it, consider, for example, three adjacent houses.</p>
      <p>The middle house is richer than the two on either side.</p>
      <p>Being much poorer, they have built their toilets along their respective compound walls, instead of indoors.</p>
      <p>This causes a stink for the house in the middle.</p>
      <p>The rich owner of the middle house has five options -- buy the two adjacent houses; sell his own house and move; pay the other two to build indoor toilets; persuade the government to ban toilets that are outside the house; or seek help from the courts... What should he do?</p>
      <p>The answer depends on the cost of each option.</p>
      <p>On the face of it, the 'build them the damn toilets' option appears cheaper, but it need not be so if the two owners turn extortionate.</p>
      <p>This often happens.</p>
      <p>Nor can he depend on the government because it will want their two votes against his one.</p>
      <p>And the courts will hand down rulings that cannot be enforced.</p>
      <p>That's why the core question: How much is it worth to the rich house-owner not to have his whole house stinking and his water supply contaminated?</p>
      <p>
        <b>No easy solutions</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the question that the Delhi, UP, Punjab, and Haryana governments have to answer.</p>
      <p>One way is to pay farmers not to grow paddy.</p>
      <p>It's a lot of money for 15 million tonnes of paddy at Rs 36,000 per tonne.</p>
      <p>This cost can be met only via a cess or a municipal tax on about 50 million people who live in the NCR.</p>
      <p>That means about Rs 10,000 per person per year.</p>
      <p>But questions can be asked: If you are going to pay farmers not to grow paddy, why not pay all polluters.</p>
      <p>Thus, car owners could be paid not to drive, coal-based power plants paid to shut down, construction companies to stop construction, etc.</p>
      <p>So we come back to the temporary cure rather than permanent prevention, namely, target the stubble.</p>
      <p>This involves technological solutions, the equivalent of better fuel and better car engines, etc.</p>
      <p>Some also suggest that we create a market for the stubble.</p>
      <p>But how do you get it out in the first place? Indeed, that's why it is burnt as the cheapest form of disposal.</p>
      <p>As you can see, there are no cheap solutions.</p>
      <p>Someone will have to bear the cost, which has to be shared by everyone except the polluters.</p>
      <p>But the stubble-burning problem is so temporary -- just about a month -- that no one will agree to pay.</p>
      <p>Net net: You can't consume clean air if you won't pay for it just because it's a 30-day problem.</p>
