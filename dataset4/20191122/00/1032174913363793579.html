      <p>Neutral Bay’s <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/bars/oaks-hotel">The Oaks Hotel</a>, a 133-year-old pub and local institution, has unveiled the first new venue to come out of its <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/food-and-drink/article/neutral-bay-hotel-oaks-getting-biggest-upgrade-its-133-year-history">multi-million-dollar makeover</a>.</p>
      <p>The sports bar, Taffy’s, is named after David “Taffy” Thomas, who bought the iconic lower north shore pub in 1975 and still pulls taps behind The Oaks’s bar.</p>
      <p>The venue can fit 300 people and has 19 screens – including a mammoth one that’s over six metres long – to make sure no one misses out on any of the action. Individual screens are also available for private viewing in the plush leather booths.</p>
      <p>There are odes to pop culture and sporting icons all over the place – a life-sized statue of Aussie cricketer Richie Benaud; murals of Andre the Giant and Muhammad Ali; and custom beer-tap handles with Hulk Hogan, poker chips, a Nintendo NES controller and even Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The menu features quirky takes on sports-bar snacks and pub classics: there are Reuben spring rolls filled with Swiss cheese, pastrami and sauerkraut; loaded duck nachos made with fried wontons instead of corn chips; buckets of maple-glazed chicken wings; and foot-long hotdogs topped with fillings such as chicken parmigiana and Peking duck.</p>
      <p>There are 20 beers on tap (with lots of local and independent craft varieties); a number of the taps will rotate each month. The cocktail list includes three kinds of Negronis, a Macadamia &amp; Wattle Old Fashioned, a Sticky-Date Espresso Martini and a couple of $30 jugs, too.</p>
      <p>Taffy’s is also home to a large foosball table (possibly the biggest in the state) that can accommodate eight players, as well as arcade-style basketball hoops, pinball machines and air hockey.</p>
      <p>Two more venues will open soon in the pub: a conservatory with an outdoor patio and bay windows, and a bottle shop with a cellar-door-style tasting room and takeaway bar.</p>
