      <h1>New Tesla Cybertruck Can Withstand “Sledgehammers and Bullets”</h1>

      <p>We don’t have Tesla in South Africa and while the company hopes to one day bring the fleet to the sunny tip of Africa, we have to sit by and watch America get nice things. The latest is the new Tesla Cybertruck which looks like something right out of a video game and it looks like a “concept car” it is actually real and will be available for purchase in 2022. Pre-orders are now open at <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">tesla.com/cybertruck</a></p>

      <p>The Tesla Cybertrunk was revealed during a special event in Los Angeles last night. It comes in three versions with 250 miles, 300 miles and 500 miles or range. They also start at $39,900 respectively. We would convert this to Rands but we pay way too much money for cars in SA so this would cost well over R1 million.</p>

      <p>According to Elon Musk, the truck will kick-off assembly in late 2021 and has been designed to be as rugged as possible. During the reveal, Frans von Holzausen even hit the door several times with a sledgehammer and it showed no visible damage. Tesla claims the truck is bulletproof and can even out match a Ford F150 and drag race a Porche 911.</p>
      <p>However, during the reveal, the truck showed its rough edges when the glass shattered from metal balls. Tesla claims this can be easily improved.</p>
      <p>The design of the truck can seat six adults and has been made from an ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel. It can carry up to 1600kgs with 100 cubic feet of storage space. Of course, the inside will feature the iconic Tesla operating system all on a new 17-inch display.</p>
