      <p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) - Motorists may again travel westbound Interstate 40 through the Pigeon River Gorge in North Carolina after repairs were completed to a bridge.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Transportation says barricades were removed, opening the westbound lanes between mile markers 15 and 20 on Thursday. The repairs involved a bridge over Jonathan Creek and White Oak Road, and have been finished in time for the Thanksgiving holiday travel period.</p>
      <p>Division 14 resident engineer Nathan Tanner says there were worries that the work could take up to five days, but the contractor finished the repairs in three days.</p>
