      <h2>Teala Davies has filed a lawsuit in New York claiming that she met the tycoon when she was 17 in 2002 through her older sister, who Epstein was also abusing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:25:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author">Christopher Bucktin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/christopher-bucktin/</a></address>
      <p>A woman claimed paedophile Jeffrey Epstein raped and trafficked her for two years before kicking her out onto the street when she told him she'd developed an eating disorder.</p>
      <p>In a lawsuit filed in New York, Teala Davies said she was 17 when she met the millionaire in 2002 through her older sister, who he was also abusing.</p>
      <p>She claims Epstein groomed her until she was entirely reliant on him flying around his homes in New York, Florida, the US Virgin Islands and Paris while abusing her.</p>
      <p>“After Teala’s semester in Madrid, she had no home and no job. Instead, Epstein brought her to live a nomadic lifestyle in his close orbit,” the court documents allege.</p>
      <p>“Virtually every few days, Epstein would bring Teala to a different home of his, including his Manhattan townhouse and throughout the country, where he continued to sexually assault her on a frequent basis.”</p>
      <p>The mum-of-three said in her lawsuit: “Epstein also tried to introduce Teala to his ‘friends’ and essentially offer her as a sexual object to them."</p>

      <p>The court papers added: “In one instance, Epstein had Teala spend time with a well-known Hollywood producer, who then demanded and attempted to engage in abusive sexual behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Teala barely escaped.”</p>
      <p>After years of abuse, “deep despair and isolation” she developed a “severe eating disorder” which she struggled with for six months before confiding in Epstein, the documents charge.</p>
      <p>“Instead, from the moment Epstein learned of Teala’s self-destructive behaviour, he immediately cast her out,” the filing read.</p>
      <p>“Literally within hours of Teala anxiously confessing to Epstein that she did not know why, but had a compulsive need to binge and purge, he threw her out.”</p>

      <p>“He instructed her to pack up her belongings and arranged for her to be flown to Arizona. But there was nothing left for her in Arizona.</p>
      <p>"She still had no idea what had happened to her and felt it was all her fault.”</p>
      <p>Teala, who currently lives in Arizona, sank into alcoholism after being abruptly cast out following two years of abuse at the hands of Epstein and is still struggling to put her life together nearly two decades later.</p>
