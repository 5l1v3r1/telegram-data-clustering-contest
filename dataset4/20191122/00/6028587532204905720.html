      <p>Investor <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=Sarah+Ketterer">Sarah Ketterer</a> (<a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=Sarah+Ketterer">Trades</a>, <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/holdings.php?GuruName=Sarah+Ketterer">Portfolio</a>), leader of Causeway Capital Management, revealed five new holdings in her third-quarter portfolio on Thursday.Founded in 2001, the guru’s Los Angeles-based firm seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by investing in mispriced equities in both developed as well as emerging markets.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Anglogold’s financial strength was rated 5 out of 10 by GuruFocus. While the company has adequate interest coverage, the Altman Z-Score of 2.26 suggests it is under some financial pressure as it has recorded a decline in revenue per share over the past three years.</p>

Anglogold also has strong returns, a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 6 and a one-star business predictability rank. GuruFocus says companies with this rank typically see their stocks gain an average of 1.1% per annum over a 10-year period.</p>
