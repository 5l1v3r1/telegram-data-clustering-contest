        <b>2019 marks six years since the so-called Zolitude tragedy, when the roof of a <i>Maxima</i> supermarket collapsed, killing 54 people.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Thursday, 21 November, multiple Latvian officials arrived at the memorial site in Zolitude to commemorate the victims of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Rescuers received the call at 18:00 on 21 November 2013. Initially information was unclear – no one knew what happened – was there an explosion or collapse. The structure collapsed twice – the second time when rescuers were working on site.</p>

      <p>The first news about deaths came soon after the collapse. The number of confirmed deaths continued increasing by the hour. Among the victims were both customers and employees. After the second collapse, however, some of the rescuers appeared among the victims. Three State Fire and Rescue Service officers were killed in the secondary collapse.</p>
      <p>Rescue efforts continued all night and the following days until all bodies were found. 54 people were killed in the tragedy. Several dozen people were injured.</p>
      <p>This <i>Maxima</i> supermarket was opened in 2011, when it was declared one of the three best works of architecture in Latvia.</p>
      <p>Then the Prime Minister of Latvia Valdis Dombrovskis stepped down following the tragedy. Multiple construction sector-related officials were suspended.</p>
      <p>The court process about <i>Maxima</i> tragedy still continues. However, the length of the process has annoyed many. Police and office of the prosecutor took two years to perform the pre-trial investigation. The court process already lasts three years and seven months.</p>
      <p>The latest news shows that there will be both a residential home and a memorial at the site of the tragedy.</p>
