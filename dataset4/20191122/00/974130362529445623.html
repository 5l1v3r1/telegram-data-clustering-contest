      <h1>'I Didn't See It Coming' - Lille Manager Hits Out At Jose Mourinho</h1>

      <p>Lille coach Christopher Galtier has hit out at Jose Mourinho after he took two members of his coaching team to join him at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino at the Premier League club earlier this week and he took Lille's highly-rated coach Joao Sacramento as well as goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos with him.</p>
      <p>It left Galtier unimpressed with how his staff were poached.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has their own way of doing things," he said.</p>
      <p>He went on in a sarcastic tone: "But it's really classy. Really classy to act like that."</p>
      <blockquote>I was angry, the timing isn’t good. There are ways to do things. Regardless, what matters is that I agree with the decision of the president.<br/>I have also been in a deputy role. They were asked, they believe in this project, they want to go. That’s football today.</blockquote>
      <p>“My president and Luis Campos could not do anything to keep two people who couldn’t stay in this project. We’re not in the world of the Care Bears.</p>
      <p>“I learned it by phone from my president on Tuesday night. He told me about the situation. I didn’t see anything coming. We were preparing normally for the match in Paris."</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of his first game on Saturday against West Ham.</p>
