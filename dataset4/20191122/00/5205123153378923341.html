      <p>Phil Hamilton has decided to drive over 1,700 miles to the southern-tip of the continent after learning that Jim Moore, 58, had suffered a serious head injury while on holiday from Newtownabbey, Co. Antrim last week.</p>
      <p>According to <i><b>Belfast Live</b></i>, Jim was declared missing for 72 hours and a search party as well as a social media campaign had been set up in order to track him down.</p>
      <p>He was eventually found in a hospital being treated for a head injury following a fall. He's been told that due to his injury, he should avoid flying for a couple of months, making getting home a difficult task.</p>
      <p>In response to the news, Phil, from 365 Taxis out of Newtownabbey has agreed to turn off his meter and drive to Spain in order to get Jim back to Northern Ireland.</p>

      <p>The taxi firm, as well as a number of Jim's friend's have clubbed together to try and fund the trip, which will see Phil drive through Scotland, England, France and Spain before U-turning and coming all the way back.</p>
      <p>It's a trip which is expected to take at least three or four days.</p>
      <p>Hero driver Phil said:"It's just the right thing to do. Jim is out of danger but he has been advised by the medical team not to fly for a few months, so this is the best way to get him home.</p>
      <p>"He has spent time in a Spanish hospital on his own separated from friends and family and now we'll get him in the car and we can have a good chat on the way back. I'll be driving myself but the family are keeping me company.</p>
      <p>"It's about 1,700 miles to Benidorm so we've left Newtownabbey and are getting the ferry to Scotland and then we'll drive on down to Benidorm.</p>
      <p>"I might just leave the sign on for a laugh for Jim to see, but the meter is off.</p>
      <p>"It was such a relief to hear that Jim had been found after he'd been missing, and even better news that he's out of danger now.</p>
      <p>"Jim is a regular customer of 365 taxis, and when we heard he was unable to travel by air we decided we'd send a taxi out to Spain to bring him back to Newtownabbey to reunite him with his family and friends.</p>
      <p>"I can't wait until the next fare I get asks me, 'What's the longest taxi journey you have done?', to see their face when I say it was a waiting return from Newtownabbey to Benidorm and back."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for 365 Taxis said: "He can't fly for a few months and he just wants to get home to his family.</p>
      <p>"So we are sending a taxi. It's fair to say here at 365 Taxis we really are more than just a taxi company. Phil should arrive in Benidorm on Saturday or Sunday to pick up his passenger and we wish them all well."</p>
      <p>What a legend!</p>
