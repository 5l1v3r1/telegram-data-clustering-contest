      <p><i>Cons woman to get into her house and escapes with gold, cash</i> <br/><br/>A 27-year-old woman was conned by a man who claimed to be a cable operator. The man entered her house and escaped with the valuables. The man told her that he was giving connections to two new channels in the area and asked her to hold the cable on the terrace. As she was holding it, he went down under the pretext of checking the channels, ransacked her house and fled with cash and valuables worth Rs. 60,000. <br/><br/>The complainant, Thabarak Nisa, is a resident of Chokkasandra and a homemaker. She said that her house is on the second floor where she stays with her husband, a welder, and four children. “On the day of the incident, I was on the terrace of our building when I noticed a man standing and checking the cables wires. It was around 3:30 pm. The man introduced himself as a cable operator. He told me that he had joined recently and was giving connections to two new channels in the area. He came down from the terrace along with me and checked our TV. He asked me to give him the list of channels that I was not getting and that he would give me connections to them as well. After a while he went up to check the cables and from the terrace, he called me and asked me to come up and help him,” she said. <br/><br/><br/>She said her children were playing in front of our house, so she left the door open and went up. “He asked me to hold the cable in one particular angle so that the connection wouldn’t get lost. I was holding the cable and he told me that he would go down and check if the channels are working. He went down and did not return for almost 10 minutes so I decided to leave the cable and go down to check. I was shocked to see that my house was ransacked by him.” The man had opened all the drawers from the cupboard and all the clothes were lying on the ground. “Just two days before the incident, we had purchased two gold chains for the children along with a pair of anklets which he took along with Rs. 5,000 in cash,” she said. <br/><br/>She added that she did not have balance on her phone to cross check with the cable operator in the area otherwise she would have called him immediately. “I did not know his name and my husband was not at home when the incident took place. I filed a complaint with the police on Tuesday,” she said. <br/><br/><br/>Peenya police have registered a case and are investigating.</p>
