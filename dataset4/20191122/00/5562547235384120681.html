      <h1>Carmelo Anthony: Jared Dudley ‘Wasn’t Keeping a Roster Spot from Me’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> publicly went to bat for Lakers backup forward <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/jared-dudley">Jared Dudley</a>, pushing back against the suggestion Dudley took up a roster spot that was rightfully his in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“You can’t blame him for what I went through,” Anthony says.</p>

      <p>Melo, who inked a non-guaranteed deal with the Portland Trail Blazers this week, also downplayed any on-court beef he may have had with Dudley in the past.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/carmelo-anthony-on-jared-dudley-you-cant-blame-him-for-what-i-went-through-154715777.html">Yahoo Sports</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Me and Jared Dudley had some issues in the past, man, but I started feeling bad for him a little bit,” Anthony told Yahoo Sports. “I mean, not feeling bad, but it’s just like, ‘Leave that man alone.’ It’s not his fault. Teams that wanted him, they wanted a specific role, and that’s why they picked him up. I had to tell some guys to lay off. He wasn’t keeping a roster spot from me. That wasn’t the case. The [treatment] he received wasn’t right.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Anthony expounded on the issues he had with Dudley.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Man, it was just some game s— in [competition],” he told Yahoo Sports. “S— that happened on the court. Nothing serious. We don’t have any problems.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>It’s been a long journey to get back to where he belongs, but it was that experience — which caused so much unnecessary vitriol directed toward Dudley — he said he won’t take for granted.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Yeah, [Dudley] didn’t deserve that,” Anthony told Yahoo Sports. “We were in different situations. You can’t blame him for what I went through.”</i>
