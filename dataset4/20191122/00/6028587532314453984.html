      <p>On November 11, 2019, with 5:51 remaining in the first quarter, the Houston Rockets sent on Eric Gordon to replace Russell Westbrook in the lineup.The booing and jeers that followed marked the most engaged fan moment of the first half. Every time Gordon touched the ball marked one of the loudest moments in the game. Even in garbage time of a lost cause game, the remaining fans remembered to boo Gordon at every opportunity.</p>
      <p>Gordon last played for the Pelicans in 2016.</p>
      <p>Anthony Davis is a far bigger basketball villain in New Orleans, for good reason. He left wearing his cynicism of the city on his shirt. His exit from the city is so recent he has yet to finish writing his tongue-in-cheek goodbye thank you letter. He should not bother. Anything Davis wrote would be seen as disingenuous.</p>
      <p>The welcome back boos directed towards Davis will be genuine.</p>
      <p>Davis has played barely more than a dozen games in a non-NOLA jersey but it seems so long ago for the Griffin-era Pelicans. The same applies to Davis. Despite some early struggles Davis is thriving next to LeBron James, there is no doubt. His instincts and timing create space and put him ahead of plays before less athletically gifted opponents. Davis is taking advantage of those highlight-reel opportunities.</p>
      <p>His fundamentals on defense mean he can guard down while also battling on the low block. He is quick enough to recover in the pick and roll. He can contest every shot without fouling. All of those skills are coming together now that Davis has departed New Orleans.</p>
      <p>All of the angst and fury surrounding that departed will come together on November 27. It will be a contentious Thanksgiving Eve affair of divorced parties. Only in this scenario, the trade fodder kids get to have their day on the court with those who caused the conflict.</p>
      <p>The Won’t Bow Down motto will be tested in the coming weeks but especially against the Lakers. The Pelicans have a roster than can negate any superstar disadvantage to some degree. New Orleans also has a roster built to lift a potential superstar into the All-Star conversation. David Griffin expected that MVP candidate to be Jrue Holiday, who won’t bow down’ against Davis. Holiday kept Kevin Durant from backing him down in the playoffs after all.</p>
      <p>The three former Lakers will have plenty of motivation as well. Brandon Ingram has taken the opportunity to show he is also an emerging superstar. Josh Hart said he was no “mouse in the house” during media day and has spent the season proving to be the Pelicans junkyard dog with a double-double sized bite. Lonzo Ball will be tied to the Los Angeles narrative until he thrives outside of that environment. The best way to make Los Angeles notice something outside of the city is to beat the Lakers.</p>
      <p>The Pelicans will need a few more weeks to climb to .500 no matter the result of the Lakers game at home. The team is starting to win and has only a couple more road games before the Lakers come to town. Even without a win against Utah or the Los Angeles Clippers, there will now be a more raucous atmosphere now that the Pelicans are climbing into contention. Still, New Orleans has been looking forward to this game for months.</p>
      <p>The Lakers game took on greater importance once Opening Night was spoiled by Zion Williamson’s injury. Williamson will not return until December, and this team’s story is incomplete without Zion taking the floor. However, The new-look Pelicans can start taking hold of their narrative starting next Wednesday.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The same can be said for Anthony Davis. He must face his past. In that light, Davis will get dressed in the visitor’s locker room before the most important game Davis plays in New Orleans.</p>
      <p>James knows Davis will have a tough night dealing with heckling fans. Davis can spoil the fun on his return by shutting down the remaining Pelicans. New Orleans will finally have to score on the potential <a href="https://twitter.com/hmfaigen/status/1197081907432804352?s=20">Defensive Player of the Year</a> that used to call the Smoothie King Center home. James is already stumping for Davis, for good reason.</p>
      <p>"We know how great AD is. It starts defensively. He's right there right now as probably the Defensive Player of the Year if you just look at the numbers and what we've been able to do."</p>
      <p>Should Davis dominate the paint against the Pelicans, the fans will have a hard time staying engaged. It is easier to heckle a missed shot than a missed block or rebound.</p>
      <p>The passing of compliments extends to the court. James<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/beatsow28021961lebrondavis/los-angeles-lakers-instant-chemistry-surprising-lebron-james-anthony-davis"> passes to Davis</a> more than any other teammate. Frank Vogel noted, “I think LeBron's just done everything in his power to make sure that he's going out of his way to make sure Anthony's comfortable with his new team."</p>
      <p>Alvin Gentry has to make the Lakers uncomfortable. New Orleans must disrupt the Davis/James connection. The Pelicans are starting to find their way. They have a chance to run Los Angeles out of the building and in effect lifting the spirits of the team back near offseason levels.</p>
      <p>The Pelicans (115.6) are 5th in points per game. The Lakers (110.9) are 15th. New Orleans is 4th in pace of play. Los Angeles sits at 24th. New Orleans cannot allow James and Davis to slow the pace down to a two-man show. Nothing would please the fans in attendance more than enjoying a large lead and chanting at Davis as he sulks his way through a hopeless fourth quarter. Any (every?) posterizing dunk over Davis would hype the crowd to a new season-high.</p>
      <p>The Pelicans would only be a couple of games out of a playoff spot with a win. Sitting comfortably in the range of a playoff spot would make the last two weeks of waiting for Zion Williamson’s return all that more manageable.</p>
      <p>Then the second act of the season begins with an eye toward the second round of this new rivalry: A possible playoff series with all of the main stars healthy and on the court.</p>
