      <p>Cairo – 22 November 2019: Egypt’s Africa 2019 Conference is a chance to continue working on the desired development by African nations; Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al Sisi said on Friday. <br/><br/>During his opening speech hosted by the New Administrative Capital, Sisi affirmed that this “aspired development goes beyond the well-known challenges within the African countries.” <br/><br/>“Egypt has worked during the past period with its African partners to achieve development” Sisi said. He added that better results were witnessed by African citizens as a result of cooperation and Joint work. <br/><br/>Sisi also said that working on increasing the intra-regional trade is a must, as the current rate doesn’t exceed 15 percent. <br/><br/>He added that the current circumstances inside the continent requires us to make our countries a “manufacturing hub” aiming at attracting more investment, increase productivity and raise growth rates. <br/><br/>Sisi called “Africa’s development partners” and investors to participate at meeting Africa’s aspiration “in accordance with our programs and with the best terms.” “We call on multinational companies to invest in Africa with, the land of multiple opportunities and chances” Sisi said. <br/><br/>He assured that development is not the government’s responsibility only, but also the privet sector. <br/><br/>Sisi hoped that Egypt’s Africa 2019 Conference will witness “constructive dialog” reaching “recommendations based on what has been achieved of development already.”</p>
