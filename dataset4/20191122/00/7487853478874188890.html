      <h1>Granada vs Atlético Madrid Preview: Where to Watch, Live Stream, Kick Off Time &amp; Team News</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15245121" target="_blank">Bradley Rice</a></address>
      <p>Atlético Madrid will look to heap pressure on the top two in Spain when they travel to Granada in La Liga on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Goals from Ángel Correa, Álvaro Morata and Koke sealed a 3-1 comeback win at home to Espanyol last time out and three points will be on Atléti's agenda again this weekend.</p>

      <p>Diego Simeone's side currently sit third in the table, one point behind familiar foes Barcelona and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a> who are both tied on 25 points, however, due to El Clasico's postponement, Atléti have played one game more.</p>
      <p>On current form it looks plain sailing for El Chulo and his team - Atlético are unbeaten in five while Granada's 2-0 loss to Valencia in their last game was their third in a row in La Liga.</p>
      <p>However, although they have slid to eighth after recent performances, <i>El Graná </i>were surprise leaders not so long ago<i> </i>and this year's newly-promoted side have already claimed the scalp of <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​Barcelona</a> this season.</p>
      <p>That 2-0 win over the Catalan giants is one of four that Granada have accumulated at home and visitors Atléti will be wary that walking away from Andalusia with a victory is no easy task.</p>

      <p>Granada skipper Victor Diaz returned to training in the last few days after a spinal injury suffered in the defeat to Valencia but he remains a doubt for the fixture on Saturday. </p>
      <p>Defender Neder Lozano hasn't played a single minute for Granada this season and is still sidelined with the fractured shin he suffered in pre-season. </p>
      <p>But, the home side are hopeful that former <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs </a>striker Roberto Soldado is able to recover from an illness in order to face Atlético.</p>
      <p>El Chulo will have been buoyed by the sight of João Felix and Sime Vrsaljko training this week, but Saturday's game may be too soon for the pair to return to Atlético's lineup.</p>

      <p>Simeone will also have to do without midfielders Saúl Ñiguez and Thomas Partey, who both miss the game through suspension having picked up yellows in the Espanyol game. </p>
      <p>Atlético continue to miss centre back duo, Stevan Savic and José Giménez who both remain injured. </p>
      <p>As is Diego Costa, who isn't expected to be in action until the New Year after undergoing neck surgery, with his return date likely to be February.  </p>

      <p>It's safe to say <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/atletico">​Atlético Madrid</a> have the upper hand in this fixture, given that Granada haven't registered a win against <i>Los Rojiblancos</i> this century. </p>
      <p>The two teams have met 13 times in La Liga, with Atlético victorious on 11 of those occasions, and during which, Granada have only netted 5 times. </p>
      <p>What's more, Diego Simeone's side have won the last four meetings between the two, the last fixture ended in a 1-0 away victory, courtesy of an Antoine Griezmann goal in March 2017.  </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The home side have not enjoyed the best of it lately, the Valencia defeat followed back-to-back losses to Real Sociedad and Getafe.</p>
      <p>However, Diego Martínez's side are performing beyond expectations this year and it's only due to their brilliant start to the season, where they went five unbeaten, that they appear to have stalled in recent games. </p>
      <p>It mustn't be forgotten, that Granada only ended their two-year absence from the top flight with promotion back to La Liga this year, therefore, 20 points from 13 games is a very impressive tally. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fatleti-are-on-a-roll-and-are-looking-to-stretch-their-unbeaten-run-to-ten-against-granada-this-weekend-5dd7bc18727cd9068c00000b.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8742857142857143&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9835714285714285&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In contrast, Atléti are looking at ten league games unbeaten if they avoid a defeat in Andalusia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Simeone's men last tasted defeat in La Liga against Real Sociedad in the middle of September and have put themselves in a strong position to challenge for the title.</p>
      <p>Although, they haven't been flawless and can ill afford to drop points against Granada as they did in previous away games against Vallodolid and Alavés.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Given their vastly different form going into the game, and the fact Granada have failed to beat Atlético in La Liga on 13 previous attempts, everything points towards an away win.</p>
      <p>Simeone's side will prove too strong for the spirited Andalusian side and take three points back to the capital with them.</p>
      <p>Although it will be a narrow margin of victory as Atlético have only scored more than once on one occasion away from home this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: Granada 0-1 Atletico Madrid</b>
