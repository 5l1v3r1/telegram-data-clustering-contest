      <p>Paying for things is all too easy online these days, and that's why managing your money has gotten so hard. We've all done it: You sign up for a streaming subscription or gym membership, blow past the free trial date, and it becomes a part of your monthly expenses. Some of us juggle so many accounts, we may not even notice.</p>
      <p>That's just one example of modern information overload bleeding into actual financial consequences. And as much as money management apps try to help, too often they're just one more account we have to deal with.</p>
      <p>There are exceptions, however. <a href="https://stackmedia.io/?pub_id=1834&amp;utm_source=1a5b0cv3538&amp;utm_medium=1a0b0cp107&amp;utm_term=scsf-351084&amp;utm_content=100-a0x1P000004Mww9">Truebill</a> is one notable example. It does all the things you come to expect from a money managing app, like tracking your spending, making a budget, and checking multiple bank accounts. Plus, with 256-bit SSL encryption, the security is rock-solid.</p>
      <p>But, it also takes a more active role in your financial health, not just by showing you the drains on your income but plugging them up. Got a subscription you forgot you were paying for? <a href="https://stackmedia.io/?pub_id=1834&amp;utm_source=1a5b0cv3538&amp;utm_medium=1a0b0cp107&amp;utm_term=scsf-351084&amp;utm_content=100-a0x1P000004Mww9">Truebill</a> will highlight it, and cancel it on your behalf. Got a cell service that's gouging you? <a href="https://stackmedia.io/?pub_id=1834&amp;utm_source=1a5b0cv3538&amp;utm_medium=1a0b0cp107&amp;utm_term=scsf-351084&amp;utm_content=100-a0x1P000004Mww9">Truebill</a> will negotiate a lower rate for you. It really takes the petty stuff off your plate and allows you to focus on hitting those savings goals.</p>
