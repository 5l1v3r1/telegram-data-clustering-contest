      <p>BARCELONA, Nov 22 — Spanish automaker Seat has unveiled two new urban mobility concepts in the form of a scooter and a motorised kick scooter at the Smart City Expo World Congress, which is currently being held in Barcelona. Both products are targeting scooter-sharing companies as well as the broader market.</p>
      <p>This is the first time ever that Seat has presented a scooter. Simply christened e-Scooter, it is an all-electric vehicle whose final version is destined for launch on the scooter-sharing and consumer markets in in 2020. The e-Scooter concept is equipped with an 11 kW motor, which delivers the same level of performance as a 125 cc motorbike.</p>
      <p>It can reach a top speed of 100 kph and offers an attractive range of 115 kilometres on a full charge. Its removable battery can be charged at home during the night or at public charging stations. Finally, it also offers an under-the-seat space that is sufficient to store two helmets.</p>
      <p>The other innovation presented by Seat in Barcelona is the e-Kickscooter, which follows on from the eXS launched by the company in 2018. The e-Kickscooter is designed to be more efficient than the previous model, notably with an increased range of 65 kilometres.</p>
      <p>Among other features the new kick scooter is equipped with two independent braking systems for added safety.</p>
      <p>Seat's presentation in Barcelona also coincided with the launch of a new entity, Seat Urban Mobility, which, as the name suggests, will focus on the development of urban mobility solutions. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
