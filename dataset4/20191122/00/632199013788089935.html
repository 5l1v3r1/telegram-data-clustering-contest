      <p>Cox Automotive is seeking nominations for the <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/people-news/2019/02/20/barbara-cox-woman-of-the-year-award-shortlist-confirmed">Barbara Cox Woman of the Year Award</a>, which will honour an inspirational woman within the automotive industry.</p>
      <p>Now in its second year, the award has been launched in partnership with AM and Fleet News to recognise a woman that demonstrates a commitment to innovation, leadership or community.</p>
      <p>The award is named for Barbara Cox, the business pioneer who served as director of Cox Enterprises, Cox Automotive’s parent company in the USA, and will be presented to someone that is an inspiration or role model for women pursuing a career in automotive.</p>
      <p>Last year <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/people-news/2019/03/14/jct600-s-beryl-carney-receives-barbara-cox-woman-of-the-year-award">it was presented to Beryl Carney, head of commercial vehicles for JCT600</a>, who was recognised for exceptional leadership skills demonstrated through the design and delivery of a highly successful business strategy.</p>
      <p>Alison Fisher, chief people officer at Cox Automotive, said: “Promoting diversity in our industry is a key part of our commitment to building high performing teams at Cox Automotive.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/people-news/2018/12/20/female-talent-sought-for-first-uk-barbara-cox-woman-of-the-year-award">The Barbara Cox Woman of the Year Award will shine a light on successful women that have made a significant impact on the industry</a>, and hopefully inspire others to do the same.</p>
      <p>“The award is part of our fantastic women with drive programme, which offers professional and personal development, peer-to-peer mentoring and networking opportunities for people across the automotive sector.”</p>
      <p>The nomination window is open until 17 January 2020 and will be reviewed by a panel of judges that includes Fleet News’ Deputy Editor Sarah Tooze, Auto Trader’s COO Catherine Faiers, Cox Automotive UK’s CEO Martin Forbes, Marshall Motor Group’s CEO Daksh Gupta, and last year’s winner JCT600’s Beryl Carney.</p>
      <p>The winner will be announced on the 6 March 2020 at a special women with drive event to celebrate International Women’s Day.</p>
      <p>As well as the award, she will receive £5,000 to spend on her own personal development.</p>
      <p>Nominations for the award are invited from across the automotive industry, and should be entered via www.womenwithdrive.co.uk/barbara-cox-award</p>
