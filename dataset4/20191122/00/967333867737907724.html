        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have been protesting for the past several days, demanding a complete rollback of a proposed hike in hostel fees, along with reconvening the Inter-Hall Administration meeting which passed the proposed fee hike last month.</b>

      <p>Lending support to striking students of India’s premier Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), another prominent student union of the city -- Delhi University Student Union (DUSU) – joined the fee-hike issue on Thursday by staging a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911141077298989-jnu-student-protest-massive-agitation-forces-govt-to-relax-fee-hike-protestors-say-not-giving-up/">massive protest</a> in the capital, seeking Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank’s resignation.</p>
      <p>The protest was staged by DUSU, a student body representing the Delhi University and led by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).</p>
      <p>ABVP is the student wing of RSS, the parent organisation of the federally-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of India.</p>
      <p>The ABVP-led Delhi University student union organised a march to the education minister’s office, but were halted near the parliament were Section 144 (which prohibits the assembly of more than 4 people in an area) is imposed during the ongoing parliament Winter Session.</p>
      <p>Delhi police put up a triple layer of barricades. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911201077356381-jnu-fee-hike-row-bollywood-comes-out-in-support-of-protesting-students/">Some protesters</a>, however, climbed over the barricades and scuffled with security personnel – the paramilitary CRPF force and Delhi police.</p>
      <p>Several students, including top members of the ABVP group and the DUSU, were detained following the scuffle near the Parliament Street police station.</p>
      <p>Protesters raised slogans against the JNU administration and the Human Resource Development (education) Ministry who, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911211077361350-fact-check-of-x-rated-pictures-of-jnu-protest-reveals-dirty-war-of-divided-indians-/">according to students,</a> had unilaterally imposed fee hikes on the students.</p>
      <p>The JNU Students Union (JNUSU) also seeks the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, pointing out that students and teachers have lost faith in his ability.</p>
