      <h4>Members of Germany's far-right populist AfD visited Syria to prove that the country is a "safe country of origin" for migrants. They also aim to increase economic ties between Germany and the war-torn country.</h4>
      <p>Members of Germany's far-right populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) met with representatives of the Syrian government in Damascus on Friday. The meeting took place as part of a visit by the anti-immigration party to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-far-right-lawmakers-aim-to-prove-syria-is-safe-country-of-origin/a-51261260">prove that Syria is a "safe country of origin"</a> for migrants to be sent back to.</p>
      <p>The AfD said in a statement that their goal for the trip was to "assess concretely the situation in Syria in person as well as to have a dialogue over the situation surrounding the Syrian people and the current state of the peace process."</p>
      <p>The party, which has been described as anti-Islam, has long pushed for <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-lawmakers-push-for-syrian-refugee-deportations/a-46162773">the deportation of Syrians currently living in Germany.</a></p>
      <p>Friday's meeting also touched on a potential economic partnership between Germany and Syria. The AfD delegation had talks with the Syrian tourism, finance and foreign ministers who serve under President Bashar Assad, according to the DPA news agency.</p>

      <p>Senior AfD politician Steffen Kotre tweeted a link to a video saying that his party wants to send 70,000 refugees back to Syria and end sanctions against Assad's government.</p>

      <p>Most of the information about the lawmakers' visit has come through the AfD's own channels, and <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/afd-syrien-105.html">German broadcaster ARD</a> reported that coverage of their visit is being given exclusively to Russian state TV channel RT.</p>
      <p>The delegation also visited the national museum and the old town of Damascus, accompanied by senior members of the Assad regime.</p>
      <p>The visit is the second time that AfD members have traveled to Syrian to show that the country was safe for "remigration." <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-far-right-afd-politicians-travel-to-syria-in-effort-to-send-back-refugees/a-42846789">A 2018 visit was heavily criticized</a> by most other political parties in the German parliament.</p>

          <figcaption>Lawmaker visits to Syria — an overview<br/><b>German far-right lawmakers travel to Syria<br/></b>A group of state and national lawmakers with the German anti-immigration AfD kicked off a week-long trip to Syria by meeting with allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on March 6. Their goal? To prove Syria is safe enough to repatriate refugees living in Germany. Berlin sharply criticized the move, with a government spokesman saying: "Whoever courts this regime disqualifies themselves."</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Lawmaker visits to Syria — an overview<br/><b>US Senator John McCain<br/></b>The Republican senator made two controversial, private trips to Syria. The first was in May 2013 when he met with members of the opposition Free Syrian Army. Shortly thereafter, the US began training and equipping opposition forces. The second was in January 2017, when McCain met with troops in Kurdish-held northern Syria. Although criticized in the media, Washington hasn't censured the senator.</figcaption>

In a complete reversal with US policy, Gabbard met with Assad during her trip. She was staunchly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for the visit. Gabbard is one of the few US politicians to voice doubt over whether the Assad regime has been using chemical weapons.</figcaption>
