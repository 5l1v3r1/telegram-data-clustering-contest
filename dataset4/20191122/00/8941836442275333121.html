      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - The Zac Brown Band is lending its sound to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>.</p>
      <p>The Atlanta-based group will give its 2008 hit “ Chicken Fried ” a holiday twist for the Thanksgiving night matchup between the hometown Falcons and rival New Orleans Saints.</p>
      <p>Brown’s song will serve as an intro for the NBC-televised game. He says the band is “excited to help open up such a huge game in our own backyard” and adds, “Go Falcons!”</p>
      <p>The broadcast will begin with Brown receiving a text from Carrie Underwood, who normally provides the soundtrack for the opening of NBC’s Sunday Night Football.</p>
      <p>Brown reveals his guitar - strategically placed under the table - before going into an acoustic holiday version of the song.</p>
