      <h3>Cybertruck</h3>
      <p>During a Thursday evening event near SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calfornia, Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally revealed the company’s long-awaited “Cybertruck.”</p>
      <p>It’s, uh, a conversation starter.</p>

      <h3>Ultimate Durability</h3>
      <p>The five-seater truck is even <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/concept-tesla-pickup-clues-design">stranger looking</a> than we expected. It has an unusual triangular chassis that comes to a point above the driver side’s window. The overall design is “influenced partly by ‘The Spy Who Loved Me’,” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197638937109336066?s=20">tweeted</a> before the event, a reference to James Bonds’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeBqf6bYZak">iconic underwater car</a>.</p>
      <p>A “nearly impenetrable exoskeleton” will ensure “ultimate durability and passenger protection,” according to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Tesla’s website</a>.</p>

      <p>The strange truck will start at $39,900 for a single motor, rear-wheel drive variant. A far more powerful tri-motor, all-wheel drive setup will put you back $69,900. A “Self-Driving” feature listed on Tesla’s website will cost an additional $7,000.</p>
      <p>The entry level variant and the more expensive tri-motor model will available in “late 2021” and “late 2022” respectively <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-order-reservation-deposit/">according to Tesla</a>.</p>
      <p>While Tesla hasn’t officially announced battery ranges, Musk promised that a max-range model will go as far as 500 miles on a single charge. The entry level model will have a range of only 250 miles — comparable to Tesla’s other current offerings.</p>
      <h3>Let’s Go Camping</h3>
      <p>So who’s it for? Tesla showed off a number of use-cases on its website, including an optional trailer attachment that can weigh up to 7,000 pounds and a rear tent and outdoor grill variant.</p>
      <p>There’s even enough space for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain">Telsa’s brand new all terrain vehicle</a> in the truck bed, which the company added as a “one more thing” to its presentation.</p>
