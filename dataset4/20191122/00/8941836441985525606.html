      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Mac McClung scored 19 points to help give coach Patrick Ewing another signature moment at Madison Square Garden, leading Georgetown to an 82-66 victory over No. 22 Texas on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The Hoyas (4-1) used a 12-0 run early in the second half that rallied the crowd and had “Let’s go Hoyas!” chants echoing throughout the arena. With his retired No. 33 New York Knicks jersey hanging in the rafters, Ewing helped orchestrate another wild one at his favorite arena.</p>
      <p>The Hoyas are trying to make their first NCAA Tournament since 2015 and an early win over a Top 25 team could give that resume a boost.</p>
      <p>Matt Coleman made all six 3-pointers and scored 22 points for the Longhorns (4-1). Texas lost with former Longhorn and injured Nets center Kevin Durant watching courtside.</p>
      <p>The Longhorns shot 37% from the floor and had 12 turnovers.</p>

      <p>Jamorko Pickett scored 15 points and James Akinjo had 14 for the Hoyas.</p>
      <p>NO. 1 DUKE 87, CALIFORNIA 52</p>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Mike Krzyzewski won for the 217th time with Duke ranked No. 1, matching John Wooden for record in the Blue Devils’ 87-52 romp over California on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>Krzyzewski is 217-34 when the Blue Devils hold the top spot, a mark they hit this week in The Associated Press poll. Wooden went 217-11 during his run at UCLA.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Krzyzewski can set the record Friday night at MSG if the Blue Devils (5-0) knock off Georgetown in the final of the 2K Empire Classic.</p>
        <p>Duke is ranked No. 1 for the 143rd week, extending its record, and has the top spot in the AP poll for the 20th season under Krzyzewski, also a record.</p>
        <p>Vernon Carey led Duke with 31 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
