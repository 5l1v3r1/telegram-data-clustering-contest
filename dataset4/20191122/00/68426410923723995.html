      <h1>Badger Daylighting insiders buy after bad news</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ted Dixon</a></address>
      <p>We donâ€™t like to see insiders selling after bad news as it raises the question of whether more bad news might be on the way. Ideally, we want to see insider buying as that suggests market reaction may be overdone and that the depressed stock price could represent a buying opportunity. This is what we have seen at Badger Daylighting Ltd. after the company lowered 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance on Nov. 5. Insiders have spent $1.2-million buying shares in the public market since the bad news was announced.</p>
