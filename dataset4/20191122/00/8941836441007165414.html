      <h1>Merkel’s heir apparent takes on critics, wins applause</h1>

      <p>BERLIN (AP) - German Chancellor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Angela Merkel</a>’s embattled heir apparent sought to silence critics Friday, throwing down the gauntlet for any member of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-democratic-party/">Christian Democratic Party</a> to challenge her if they didn’t like the direction in which she was leading the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-democratic-party/">party</a>.</p>
      <p>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s nearly 90-minute impassioned address was met with a lengthy standing ovation at a party convention in Leipzig, where many had expected her to be taken to task after a series of poor results in state elections.</p>
      <p>“If you are of the opinion that the path that I want to take together with you is not the right one, then let’s say it clearly, let us end it, here and now and today,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But, dear friends, if you are of the opinion that you want this <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/germany/">Germany</a>, if you are of the opinion that we should take this path together … then let’s roll up our sleeves and get going here and now.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the speech, she took a dig at her rival, Friedrich Merz, who some had thought might openly challenge her at the convention, as well as others saying that criticizing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Merkel</a>’s government and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-democratic-party/">party</a> was “not a good campaign strategy.”</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Merz recently called the government’s image “abysmal” and laid into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Merkel</a>’s leadership style.</p>
      <p>He toned that down in his address to the convention, however, praising Kramp-Karrenbauer for her “scrappy, courageous and forward-looking speech.”</p>
      <p>“We are loyal to our chairwoman, to our party leadership and to the government,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Merkel</a> has said she won’t run for a fifth term in the 2021 election, and didn’t stand again as party leader last year, paving the way for Kramp-Karrenbauer’s election to the role after narrowly defeating Merz.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Merkel</a> has also elevated Kramp-Karrenbauer to defense minister in a move seen as increasing her profile before a possible run for the chancellorship.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Merkel</a> herself has said she intends to remain in office until the next election, and again emphasized that at the convention before Kramp-Karrenbauer’s speech.</p>
        <p>Taking the stage 14 years to the day that she became chancellor, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-merkel/">Merkel</a> reminded party delegates that since coming to power in 2005 her government had brought unemployment to record lows and weathered the world financial crisis.</p>
        <p>But she said with new challenges like digital transformation and the fight against climate change, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-democratic-party/">party</a> needs to look to the future, while overcoming new pressures like Russian aggression and trade disputes with the U.S.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-democratic-party/">party</a> needs “to find solutions for the world of tomorrow,” she said, and ensure that it is the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-democratic-party/">party</a> of “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/germany/">Germany</a>’s strong center.”</p>
        <p>“I want to continue to work for that as chancellor,” she said.</p>
