      <p>Press Release – Trademe<br/>Tenants are trying to get ahead of the summer rental rush as rents in New Zealand’s three main centres warm up, according to that latest Trade Me Rental Price Index.</p>
      <p>Trade Me’s Aaron Clancy said the median weekly rent in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch rose between $20 and $40 per week on the year prior.</p>
      <p>“Rents in Wellington city saw the largest annual increase, up 7.4 per cent on last year to $580 in October. Christchurch City saw a 5 per cent lift to $420, and Auckland City rents rose 3.6 per cent to $570.”</p>
      <p>Mr Clancy said tenants in our largest cities appeared to be trying to beat the seasonal summer rental rush and hunting out their next flat early. “October saw a growing demand for rentals in our three main metros … Wellington City saw enquiries jump 7 per cent on the year prior and Auckland City experienced a 14 per cent spike in demand.</p>
      <p>“Typically we see rents begin to heat up from December onwards but this year tenants are trying to get ahead of the game and secure a rental before Christmas. It could prove to be a very wise move, while prices are increasing now we’re predicting they’re only going to get higher as we head into the business end of summer. There will almost certainly be some new records set in early 2020.”</p>

        <b>Wellington rentals the most popular</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Clancy said rentals in Wellington were the most popular of any region after the number of enquiries on properties to rent in the region rose 13 per cent on last year.</p>
      <p>“The continuing theme of the Wellington property market is the massive demand for rental properties which keeps pushing rents up considerably. The number of rental properties available in Wellington jumped 12 per cent on September but demand continues to outstrip what’s available so we keep seeing rents head north.</p>
      <p>“The most popular rental property in New Zealand in October was in the Lower Hutt suburb of Fairfield. The two-bedroom house was listed for $340 per week in October and saw an incredible 117 enquiries in the first two days onsite.”</p>

      <p>“We’ve seen an increasing number of Wellington tenants looking for rentals outside the city centre in the, traditionally, quieter areas like Lower Hutt and Porirua, opting for a longer commute to work and more affordable rents.</p>
      <p>“The median weekly rent in the Wellington region reached $550 per week after an 11.1 per cent increase year-on-year. Taking a closer look at the region, rents in Wellington City rose 7.4 per cent on the year prior to $580, rents in Porirua were up 10 per cent to $550 and Lower Hutt saw the median weekly rent rise 15.6 per cent to $520.</p>
      <p><b>Auckland rentals in demand</b><br/>“Demand for rentals in Auckland is on the rise and tenants in the Super City are facing more competition.</p>
      <p>“The number of enquiries on rental properties in Auckland rose 21 per cent on last year while the number of properties available dipped 2 per cent.”</p>
      <p>Mr Clancy said after a quiet couple of months, the median weekly rent in Auckland rose 1.8 per cent year-on-year to $560 per week in October.<br/>The districts with the highest median weekly rents in October were Waiheke Island and Waitakere City which saw an 18 per cent jump to $580 and a 5 per cent boost to $530 per week respectively.</p>
      <p>Mr Clancy said the most popular rental property in Auckland in October was a three-bedroom house in West Harbour which had 75 enquiries in the first two days onsite.</p>
