      <h1>Scots fitness instructor who almost died in Vietnam from pneumonia to return home</h1>
      <h2>Mekala Osborne, 22, was given less than a 5% chance of survival and was flown to Singapore for specialist treatment after falling ill on holiday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:57:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:57</time> by <a rel="author">James Moncur, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/james-moncur/</a></address>
      <p>A fitness instructor who was placed in an induced coma after falling ill in Vietnam is set to finally return home to Scotland tomorrow.</p>
      <p>At one stage Mekala Osborne had just a 5% chance of surviving life-threatening pneumonia she contracted in September while on holiday.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was so critically ill that her mum Yvonne and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/family-scots-woman-coma-vietnam-20377231">stepdad Jimmy</a> , from Prestonpans, near Edinburgh, were told to “pray she survives.”</p>

      <p>But thanks to a brilliant surgeon and the support of friends and family who have raised thousands of pounds, Mekala is now well enough to face the gruelling trip home.</p>
      <p>Even though she still has a tracheotomy breathing tube and is still on a ventilator she will fly into Manchester before being transferred to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>And she will be accompanied the whole way by Yvonne, 51, and the hero medic who saved her - Dr Winston Jong, from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, in Singapore.</p>

      <p>Last night taxi-driver Jimmy, 64, said: “It’s been terribly worrying and really traumatic for us all. Physically it’s been so draining just seeing her lying there linked up to various machines.</p>
      <p>“At one stage she had three tubes going into her lungs alone.</p>
      <p>“It was touch and go at some stages especially when she was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-fitness-instructor-placed-coma-20831378">being moved from Vietnam</a> to Singapore when we were told to pray that she survives the trip - we were told that it was about a 5% chance she’d make the journey.”</p>
      <p>Mekala had been complaining of a sore throat and was coughing up blood in the days before being diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia.</p>
      <p>She told friends she had treated the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scots-woman-coma-vietnam-after-20313500">sore throat with Strepsils</a> and was astonished to be told the condition had spread to her lungs.</p>
      <p>A worried pal took her to hospital after her symptoms failed to clear up.</p>
      <p>Distraught mum Yvonne flew out to be with her daughter after close family friend and local radio DJ Davie Martin set up a fundraiser.</p>
      <p>A video posted at the beginning of October showed Mekala hooked up to machines in her hospital bed.</p>

      <p>Jimmy said he’s going to spend a “very long time” thanking people, especially Dr Jong, who saved Mekala’s life, friend Mr Martin and tifgroup - Mekala’s insurance company.</p>
      <p>He added: “If it hadn’t been for Dr Jong, Mekala would definitely have died, he’s been absolutely brilliant the whole way through. He’s a straight talking character and went above and beyond the call of duty to save Mekala.</p>
      <p>“He is one of the best and most respected doctors in Singapore and Mekala was very lucky to have him.</p>
      <p>“He insisted on flying back to the UK with her to keep her safe during the journey. He’s been absolutely astonishing.</p>
      <p>“Davie held the fort back home while we were away and kept the social media posts going and helped raise the money for the treatment and travel costs and ITF have been great too - nothing has been a problem for them.”</p>

      <p>Mekala  had originally been due to return back to Scotland at the start of the month before complications with her treatment and "underlying" problems delayed the plans.</p>
      <p>But her condition slowly improved under Dr Jong’s expert care in Singapore and the decision was taken to fly her back first class this weekend.</p>
      <p>She will be met by an ambulance on the tarmac in Manchester and transferred by road to Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Jimmy said that she will need months of physiotherapy to regain her strength and come off the ventilator. </p>

      <p>In a Facebook update a fortnight ago, Yvonne, a minibus driver for elderly care home residents, wrote: “All being well Mekala and I are will be home in two weeks.</p>
      <p>"I hope to spend most of my day working with Mekala alongside the physio and her lovely nurses and doctors.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to each and everyone of you who have supported and continue to support Mekala."</p>
