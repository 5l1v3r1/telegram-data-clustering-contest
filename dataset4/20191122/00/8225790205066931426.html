      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - <i>A mom who’s balancing a lot is asking for a little help to make sure her kids can enjoy Christmas.</i></p>

      <p>Kehau Engle just started a two-year graduate program in social work at the University of Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Balancing school, two jobs and four children is a challenge.</p>
      <p>“It’s really busy. I work during the day and I go to school at night so I don’t get to see my kids as much now,” she said.</p>
      <p>And that’s particularly hard because her oldest, 16-year-old Caleb, needs lots of support.</p>
      <p>He nearly drowned in a pool when he was 3, and needs constant care. He’s also scheduled for back surgery next year.</p>
      <p>Engle says he needs a collapsible wheelchair because it's difficult to get around in his stroller.</p>
      <p>“In this it’s really hard. I had a regular wheelchair, but because his scoliosis got really bad, it’s hard to even put him in there now," she said.</p>
      <p>Engle worries about getting gifts for her family because the bills have been high. Her van has a ramp for Caleb, but the car is so old and rundown she keeps spending money to fix it.</p>
      <p>"The one thing I need to do is get a new car. I have a ramp van right now, but I've been putting a lot of money into fixing it. I'd like to trade it in for another car because I need it for him," said Engle.</p>
      <p>Machaiah, 13, is hoping for weights so he can work out while 6-year-old Jonah and 8-year-old Sirai are wishing for tablets.</p>
      <p>For herself, Engle wants just wants something priceless: More precious time with her family.</p>
      <p>“On weekends, I try to use the time to really focus on my kids. No school work, no homework, just focusing on them,” she said.</p>
