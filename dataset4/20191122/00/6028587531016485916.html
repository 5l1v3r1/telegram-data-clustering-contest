      <p><b><i>How to Use Cash Back Portals to Make Money While You Shop</i></b>Cash back rebates are another way to save when you shop online. Thousands of online stores, from Amazon to Zale's, will pay you to buy from them. To claim your cash, you need to become a member of a cash back portal site and make that purchase using the portal. You can join for free and in most cases, you'll get a sign-up bonus, typically $5-$10. A cashback portal gets paid a commission from an affiliated retailer every time a member clicks through an offer on its site and makes a purchase. The portal splits its commission with the member.

          <i>Millions Sign Up for Mobile Payments-But How Many Stick Around Long Term?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Observers of mobile wallets have focused attention on user counts as a sign of adoption, but that leaves open the question of how many of these consumers are turning into habitual users. As it turns out, mobile-payments apps have a much harder time retaining users than do banking apps. Globally, just 16% of users on average return to a payment app the day after install, and 30 days later that number has dipped to just under 6%.

      </p>
      <p>In an ideal world, the interest rate attached to your <a href="http://www.lowcards.com/">credit cards</a> wouldn't matter because you'd pay your bills in full every month. In reality, however, many Americans routinely rack up credit card debt by carrying a balance. A surprising number of Americans are clueless as to what that rate is. According to Northwestern Mutual's 2019 Planning &amp; Progress Study, 19% of U.S. consumers don't know what their credit card interest rate is.
