      <h1>Stuttgart unseats Munich as Germany's most expensive city for renters</h1>

      <h4>After 20 years on top, Munich has lost its title as the most expensive city for German renters. A new study also shows that the suburbs are no longer a cheap alternative.</h4>
      <p>Stuttgart has overtaken Munich as the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/housing-in-germany-grows-more-expensive-than-ever/a-17181528">most expensive German metropolis</a> for renters, an analysis of German rental prices released Thursday showed. </p>
      <p>An average 65-square-meter (700-square-foot) apartment in an average Stuttgart neighborhood rents for €10.41 ($11.50) per square meter per month in 2019, excluding utilities. In Munich, renters pay an average of €9.74 per square meter.</p>
      <p>Rental prices <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-16-states-baden-w%C3%BCrttemberg/a-45148057">in Stuttgart</a> are 48% above the national average of €7.04 per square meter.</p>

Although subject to opinion, it's widely accepted that the first automobile was invented by Karl Benz in Stuttgart in 1886. Visitors can learn about the inception and development of the car in the Mercedes Benz museum, and the Porsche museum takes guests on a journey through the history of their own brand.</figcaption>

      <p>Places where rents are below the national average include the eastern cities of Erfurt, Potsdam, Dresden, the eastern side of Berlin and the northern city Schwerin. Rent in the western half of Berlin costs €7.32 per square meter, slightly above the national average. </p>
      <p>This is according to data from a newly released "Mietspiegel" or "rent index," which reflects the average price of residential rental property in cities across Germany.</p>
      <p>The study, carried out by German market research company F+B, analyzed the average cost of renting in 351 German cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants.</p>

      <p>In the town of Karlsfeld, population 22,000, the same 65-square-meter apartment rents for €10.86 per square meter in 2019, 54% above the national average.</p>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>Rental barracks<br/></b>Berlin's endless rows of tenements were once horribly overcrowded, with large families often living in one- or two-room flats. But in recent years, these so-called Altbau, or old buildings, have enjoyed a rapid renaissance. These blocks in the Prenzlauer Berg district of Berlin were, until the early 1990s, often empty and in a state of severe disrepair. Now everyone wants to rent an Altbau.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>Plattenbau<br/></b>In former East Germany, where nearly all accommodation was rented from the government, prefab concrete housing blocks known as Plattenbau rose up across the communist nation. Not only were they cheap, but they were often preferred to Altbau apartments because they offered all modern conveniences like new plumbing that didn't leak, reliable electricity and hot water.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>Balconies<br/></b>According to the most recent statistics from Statista (2015), 48 percent of Germans rent and 52 percent are home-owners. Most renters live in apartments - and make the most of their balconies. Some barbeque or lounge, while others grow overflowing gardens that utilize every last inch of precious outdoor space. Balconies can be veritable ecosystems that become rather bleak in the winter months.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>Courtyards<br/></b>In some Germans cities, particularly Berlin, rental houses are made up of front and back buildings separated by an inner courtyard through which the life of these rental communities ebb and flow. They are unique communal spaces across which people view each other's lives, and where they interact as they park their bicycles or access their numerous garbage bins.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>Names instead of numbers<br/></b>Only the names of residents are used to identify the flats inside a building in Germany. These names on the intercom of a Hamburg apartment building typically have no corresponding flat number. That means you have to address letters to Germany clearly because the mail carrier only has the name to go by.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>Flat sharing <br/></b>Known as WGs, or Wohngemeinschaften, shared apartments are popular in big cities where apartment prices are rising and availability is shrinking. People who share flats often also rent out the living area to bring prices down as much as possible. This is especially so in Berlin, a city full of artists, students and people on low budgets.</figcaption>

Leaving the walls shiny white for the next residents isn't such a bad thing - but it means you have to spend days preparing walls and climbing ladders before you move out. Not all rental contracts force tenants to paint the apartment - however they are obliged to leave it as they found it.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>What to know before renting an apartment in Germany<br/><b>BYO kitchen<br/></b>In some German cities, kitchens and appliances are not included in rental properties. That means the tenant has to purchase their own and have it installed at their expense. Alternatively, some people buy the previous tenant's kitchen at a discount if they aren't planning on taking it with them to their next living space.</figcaption>

That means that you'll find bathrooms today that are wedged into the smallest - and oddest - spaces. Or, in some cases, they might be huge and replace an entire former room. This shower in a Berlin flat was built in the kitchen cupboard.</figcaption>

        <b>Climbing rent slows down</b>
      </p>
      <p>Munich held the title of Germany's most expensive city for renters for 20 years before it was unseated by Karlsfeld last year. This year the city has fallen to 6th place while Stuttgart now ranks 2nd overall and first among the large cities.  </p>
      <p>The study also reveals that rent prices are rising at a slower rate than in the past. Rents rose 1.8% on average since last year, down from a rate of 2.2% the year before. The authors of the study point to various reasons for the slowdown, including the possibility that rent prices had become prohibitively expensive.</p>

      <p>Rent indexes in Germany influence the prices laid out in new rental contracts as well as landlord and government decisions to raise or lower rental rates.</p>
      <p>However, actual rent paid can vary wildly within cities, meaning the average price reflected in the index may not be representative of the reality on the ground. </p>
