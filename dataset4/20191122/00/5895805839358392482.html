      <p>Now that you’ve joined the 8 million people who've identified their character strengths with the <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/survey/surveys/takesurvey">VIA Survey</a>, what do you do next?</p>
      <p>Let’s turn to what you can do in both your personal life and your work-life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Make it personal!</b>
      </p>
      <p>You have all 24 of <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths">these character strengths</a> within you. All of us do. But, your strengths can quickly go dormant. This can happen without your even realizing it. Perhaps your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/humor">humor</a> has waned amidst the seriousness of your job. Or, since you’ve had kids you’ve not given yourself any space to be creative. Maybe the curiosity you once had for your relationship partner has grown stale over the years and you’re no longer asking them questions about themselves.</p>
      <p>It is normal for your character strengths to fade like this. You <i>can </i>do something about it. <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/research/findings">Research shows</a> targeting character strengths can bring you many personal benefits such as greater <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>, better relationships, and sense of accomplishment. In other words, strengths lift you out of the autopilot state of going through the motions and propel you into an active mode of engagement and self-development. And, it’s quite easy to start the process.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths">list of 24 strengths</a> that have been found across human beings. These strengths are changeable. You can develop them. Which character strength would you like to focus on? Which strength appears to be calling for your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a>!? Which character strength might help you grow as a person, right now?</p>
      <p>After you have identified one character strength you’d like to work on, take a look at your results on the VIA Survey, also known as your strengths profile. Where does your chosen strength sit in your rank-ordered results from 1-24?</p>
      <p>Does it sit in your top 5? These are called signature strengths; these are the best parts of you. Or, perhaps your chosen strength is in your bottom 5, viewed as your lower strengths, which simply means you haven’t given as much attention to these strengths or you don’t value or pursue them as much as your top strengths. Knowing where your chosen strength sits can help you understand whether you are embarking on building upon one of your highest internal sources of energy (signature strengths) or whether you are building up something less developed and likely less naturally energizing and thereby it may take a bit of additional effort.</p>
      <p>Next, explore this strength with some questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does this strength look like in action? How does it come across in your conversations? In your thinking?</li>
        <li>How important is it to you to use this character strength in your life? Why?</li>
        <li>What is a situation where you successfully used this character strength, even if it was a small way?</li>
        <li>What is one way you can take action, starting today, with this strength?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Write your thoughts to these questions or discuss them with someone. Your reflections will likely point you toward simple actions. I’d suggest you take one small action per day. As many <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/research/findings">research studies show</a>, you can give a good jolt to your well-being by using your chosen character strength (whether it’s a signature or lower strength) in one new way each day.</p>
      <p>Try this out for one week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Make your strengths work at work!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The workplace is a prime opportunity for you to express your best qualities. When you think of workplace strengths, certain strengths probably pop in your mind: perseverance, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/teamwork">teamwork</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/leadership">leadership</a>, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-control">self-regulation</a>. But, remember, all 24 strengths matter. They all matter in the workplace. Your love strength can be expressed by being warm and genuine with your colleagues, your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/forgiveness">forgiveness</a> can be expressed when a teammate makes an error, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">gratitude</a> can be offered by taking a few minutes to sit down with a colleague and let them know what strengths you appreciate in them.</p>
      <p>The opportunities for strengths use are infinite. Try this activity called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Character-Strengths-Interventions-Field-Practitioners/dp/0889374929/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3/131-6883761-7961032?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0889374929&amp;pd_rd_r=50765c29-5768-4ffb-b2eb-153bdf52091b&amp;pd_rd_w=jPYJA&amp;pd_rd_wg=tvCmd&amp;pf_rd_p=09627863-9889-4290-b90a-5e9f86682449&amp;pf_rd_r=DF6SG4Y1H2RS13YPTE45&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=DF6SG4Y1H2RS13YPTE45">character strengths alignment</a>. This involves matching your most energizing strengths – your signature strengths – with the main tasks you do at work.</p>
      <p>Here are some specific steps you can follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>List three tasks that you do most days at work.</li>
        <li>List your top 5 character strengths.</li>
        <li>Write down one way you can use one of your top strengths with one of your work tasks. Continue this process until you have infused each of your work tasks with strength.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For example, if you lead regular team meetings, you might bring forth your signature strength of fairness to make sure each participant’s opinions are heard, or your signature strength of hope to point out future directions and positive expectations for current projects. If one of your tasks is “sending e-mails to customers or clients,” you might deliberately align your curiosity to pose questions with genuine interest or your gratitude to offer statements of appreciation for their effort on a particular project.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Your strengths are waiting</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whether you’re improving yourself in your relationship, with your family, or in the workplace, you never have to look far for some of your best, energizing resources. It’s as if your strengths are already there, waiting for you to ignite the flame.</p>
