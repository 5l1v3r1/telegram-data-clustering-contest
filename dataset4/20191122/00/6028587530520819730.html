      <h1>Where To Feast On Truffles In Boston This Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jeanne O'Brien Coffey</a></address>
      <p>Want to immediately impress your friends, perfume your meal — and add a couple hundred bucks to your dinner tab in the blink of an eye? It’s truffle season, and this fungus that grows at the base of trees – especially oaks – in Europe and has stubbornly refused cultivation, doesn’t come cheap. But when November arrives, chefs are keen to shave truffles on everything. Whether you want to pick up your own to perfume your kitchen on the cheap, enjoy a truffled ramen noodle cacio e pepe ($145) or splash out on a seven-course truffle menu, including truffled macarons for dessert ($250) – here’s a list of top spots.</p>
