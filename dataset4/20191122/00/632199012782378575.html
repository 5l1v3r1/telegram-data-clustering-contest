      <p>Suffolk County Council has dismissed two employees for misuse of pool cars, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The misconduct was discovered following an investigation by the local authority.</p>
      <p>Suffolk County Council investigated 113 members of staff for misuse of pool cars between April 2017 and June 2018, 13 of whom were found to have abused the system.</p>
      <p>Of those, two were dismissed; three received final written warnings; one received a first written warning; two had no case to answer for and one had reached a settlement agreement because of an ongoing disciplinary investigation for a separate matter, according to a<a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/suffolk-county-council-pool-car-misuse-1-6387487"> report by the Eastern Daily Press (EDP</a>).</p>
      <p>There were also three who received non-formal disciplinaries and one temporary worker who had their contract terminated.</p>
      <p>A spokesman from Suffolk County Council told the EDP: "We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding the misuse of council resources, so where evidence has been found of this, appropriate action will be taken.</p>
      <p>"Our employees are frequently reminded of our policy on pool cars, mileage and subsistence.</p>
      <p>"These are regularly audited to identify any apparent misuse and allow us to investigate and take action accordingly."</p>
      <p>Council rules state that pool cars should not be taken after 5pm, on weekends or booked in the week to continue over a weekend, unless prior permission had been sought.</p>
      <p>Another member of staff was dismissed in the summer of 2017 after a whistleblower reported the individual to have misused pool cars prior to the review.</p>
      <p>The cost to taxpayers has not yet been identified, but it is understood that the council recovered around Â£2,000.</p>
      <p>Council chiefs sent reminders to staff about pool car use and updated the internal bookings, following the investigation.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2016/01/26/tax-warning-for-pool-fleets-over-private-use">Pool cars must not be used for personal use, else they'll be eligible for benefit taxation.</a>
