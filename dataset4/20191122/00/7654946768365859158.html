      <h1>Imelda Staunton may take the ‘Crown’ from Olivia Colman</h1>

      <p>All hail the next Queen Elizabeth II?</p>
      <p>Imelda Staunton, who played Dolores Umbridge in “Harry Potter” and Maud Bagshaw in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/09/downton-abbey-shouldve-stayed-a-tv-show/">“Downton Abbey” film</a>, is likely poised to take over the role of the queen in “The Crown,” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7712637/Imelda-Staunton-Claire-Foy-Olivia-Colman-Crown.html">according to Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>Staunton, 63, will reportedly pick up the role from Colman, 45, for Seasons 5 and 6 of the hit Netflix series.</p>
      <p>However, a spokesperson for Netflix tells The Post that nothing has been decided yet. “We are currently filming Season 4 of ‘The Crown,’ but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation,” the rep says.</p>
      <p>The speculation comes less than a week after the premiere of Season 3, which features a new cast, including Colman, Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham Carter. The same cast will stay for Season 4, which is set to air in late 2020.</p>
      <p>Daily Mail reports Staunton will play the queen from her mid-60s on.</p>
      <p>Claire Foy, 35, played the part for Seasons 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>Staunton began her career as a stage actress in the UK in the 1970s. She was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 2005 for her performance in the film “Vera Drake.” Her long list of credits also includes “Much Ado About Nothing,” “Sense and Sensibility,” “Shakespeare in Love,” “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” and many more. Staunton is also set to play the lead role in “Hello, Dolly!” in the West End next year.</p>
