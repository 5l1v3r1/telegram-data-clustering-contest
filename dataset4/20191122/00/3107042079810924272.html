      <p>The New Zealand Open will be free to watch next year as organisers throw the gates open.</p>
      <p>It will be free entry to both Millbrook Resort and The Hills, allowing everyone the ability to watch the best players from across New Zealand, Australia and Asia in action.</p>
      <p>Tournament director Michael Glading said the move had been made to entice people from across the country to come and enjoy everything the New Zealand Open had to offer.</p>
      <p>"We've held the Open in Queenstown for eight consecutive years and as an event, it's reached the level of maturity and support that means we can open our gates for the 2020 event," Glading said.</p>
      <p>"While we're making the event free entry there will be a charge for car parking with all proceeds going to the Rotary Club of Queenstown to distribute. As part of the evolution of the event we've always wanted the Open to have a larger charity element."</p>
      <p>Queenstown resident and professional golfer Ben Campbell is making his eighth appearance at the 2020 New Zealand Open and is hoping a large local crowd turns up to support both the local and international players.</p>
      <p>"As professional players, we love seeing large crowds on the course, and hearing their reactions around the green really gives us a buzz," Campbell said.</p>
      <p>"Removing the cost of entry to New Zealand's premier tournament is a great way to allow everyone the chance to enjoy top-level golf in our backyard."</p>
      <p>This year's tournament will be from February 27 to March 1. The tournament is a co-sanctioned event on the PGA Tour of Australasia and Asian Tour schedules.</p>
      <p>The tournament also has a partnership agreement with the Japan Golf Tour.</p>
