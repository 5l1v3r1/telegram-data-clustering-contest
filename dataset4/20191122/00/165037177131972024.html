      <h1>Bale named in Real Madrid squad after Wales banner controversy</h1>

        <b>Zinedine Zidane has included Gareth Bale in Real Madrid's squad for the clash with Real Sociedad, though Vinicius Junior has missed out.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Gareth Bale</a> has been included in <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>'s squad for their La Liga encounter with <b>Real Sociedad</b> despite the controversy caused by<b> his celebrations after Wales' successful Euro 2020 qualification</b>.</p>
      <p>Wales <b>booked their place at next year's finals</b> with a 2-0 win over Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Bale, who has<b> not played for Madrid since October 5,</b> featured from the start for Ryan Giggs' side and was pictured after the match <b>singing and dancing </b>behind a banner that read:<b> 'WALES. GOLF. MADRID…IN THAT ORDER'.</b></p>
      <p>The slogan originates from a chant by Wales supporters that<b> pokes fun at perceptions among the Spanish media, </b>who have accused Bale of bumping Madrid down his list of priorities and spending too much time on the golf course.</p>

      <p>Those celebrations<b> drew further criticism from sections of the Madrid press </b>and Los Blancos' fanbase, but Zidane – whose relationship with Bale has reportedly been a troubled one –<b> claimed on Friday that the issue had been overblown.</b></p>
      <p><b>Zidane has now included Bale in his squad for Saturday's clash </b>with Sociedad, who would move above Madrid with a win at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Bale's inclusion comes <b>at the expense of Vinicius Junior</b>, with the teenage winger missing out on the 19-man selection.</p>
      <p><b>Vinicius has made eight appearances in La Liga this term</b>, though only four of those have been starts.</p>
