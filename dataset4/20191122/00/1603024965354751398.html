        <b>Angel Broking's currency report on EURINR</b>
      </p>
      <p>EURUSD depreciated by 0.14 percent yesterday while EURINR depreciated by 0.04 percent during the same time frame. Christine Lagarde has taken the helm of the ECB. Meanwhile, the meeting minutes suggested a wait-and-see stance that the ECB has taken after the monetary easing announced in September. After all, they have to wait for the effect of the last easing round to show on the economy. There is also a call for unity, which shows how fragmented the governing council is at the moment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>OUTLOOK</b>
      </p>
      <p>EURINR is expected to move sideways in today’s session.</p>
