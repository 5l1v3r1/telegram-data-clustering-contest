        <b>Turkish side Gaziantep <b>F.K</b> have made a €5 million offer for Phoenix Rising captain Solomon Asante ahead of the winter transfer window, GHANASoccernet.com can exclusively report.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The diminutive winger was in dazzling form for American outfit Phoenix Rising in the just ended United Soccer League Championship.</p>
      <p>Asante won the league's Golden Boot after netting 22 goals with just three goals shy of the highest number of goals by a player in a single season in the history of the Championship.</p>
      <p>The Ghana international also set two USL records this season as he made the highest number of assists in a single season with 17 and a combined goals and assists of 39.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old's swashbuckling has prompted several clubs in the Major League Soccer and Europe to enquire about his services next term.</p>
      <p>Reports reaching GHANASoccernet.com suggest that Turkish Super Lig outfit Gaziantep have acted swiftly by making a concrete offer of €5 million for the Ghanaian ahead of the forthcoming window transfer window.</p>
      <p>However, the Arizona-based side are reported to be reluctant on selling their prized asset in January with the hope that they will get an improved offer for him during the summer window.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if the Didier Drogba-owned club will soften their stance for the Falcons.</p>
      <p>Should Gaziantep manage to acquire the winger, he will become the fourth Ghanaian on the books of the club after Yusif Rahman Chibsah, Aziz Tetteh and Patrick Twumasi.</p>
