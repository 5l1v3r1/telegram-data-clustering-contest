      <p>Video Games are a big part of Black Friday, and there’s still no US video game retailer quite like GameStop. It’s always a major part of Black Friday and a big destination for people picking up new video game hardware or software, and this year it’s kept its ad until the very last moment. But here it is, for your perusing pleasure. There are some execellent deals in the mix here, some we’ve seen elsewhere but solid nonetheless. For the full ad, go to www.GameStop.com/BlackFriday.For one thing, <i>Anthem</i> is on sale. Note to the moderately curious: maybe don’t buy <i>Anthem</i>, even at $5.</p>
      <p><b>Doorbusters:</b> Some good stuff in here, with those retailer-specific cashback bonuses that can sweeten even standard deals. You can get store credit for a Nintendo Switch Lite, and there are precious few deals on that thing this season. There are also some solid software deals, as well as a super cheap Xbox One. A refurbished one, naturally, but that’s fine if we’re being honest. Here are the doorbusters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Bundle: Receive a free digital copy of Mario Kart 8 plus a $25 gift coupon (Thursday and Friday)</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Lite: Receive a $25 gift coupon (Saturday and Sunday)</li>
        <li>Xbox One 500GB – Certified Refurbished or Pre-Owned Original: $99</li>
        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare C.O.D.E. Edition: $38 (Thursday-Saturday)</li>
        <li>The Division 2: $12</li>
        <li>Anthem: $5</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20, Madden NFL 20, FIFA 20: $28 each</li>
        <li>POP! Vinyl Figures: Buy 2, Get 1 Free ($11.99)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Consoles:</b> Here’s the meat of it. We can see here the flagship deals for PS4, Xbox One and Switch, which we’ve seen at other retailers: in the case of the Swith, a $25 gift coupon makes it a little more attractive, but note that this is not the new version with better battery life. That Xbox One all-digital and that PS4 with God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn and The Last of Us remain excellent deals, however, as does an Xbox One S with <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sony PS4 1TB Bundle with God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn and The Last of Us: $199.99 ($100 savings)</li>
        <li>Sony PS4 Pro 1TB Glacier White System, Only at GameStop: $299.99 ($100 savings) plus receive a $25 gift coupon</li>
        <li>Xbox One S 1TB Bundle with Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order: $199.99</li>
        <li>Xbox One X Limited Edition 1TB Bundle with NBA 2K20 Only at GameStop: $349.99 ($150 savings)</li>
        <li>Xbox One S 1TB All-Digital Bundle with Fortnite Battle Royale, Minecraft and Sea of Thieves: $149.99 ($100 savings)</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Bundle: Receive a free digital copy of Mario Kart 8 plus a $25 gift coupon (Thursday and Friday)</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Lite: Receive a $25 gift coupon (Saturday and Sunday)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Software:</b> Some solid stuff in here, some clunkers. <i>Breath of the Wild</i> never seems to drop below $40, so it’s worth getting. <i>Gears 5</i> comes in Games Pass, so it’s not quite a bargain in the same way, even if it is excellent. If you want <i>Fallout 76</i>, you probably already have it, so maybe steer clear, and definitely steer clear of WWE 2K20, which is a disaster. <i>Spiderman</i>, however? Nothing wrong with that, even if we’ve seen plenty of good deals on it before.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption: $29.99</li>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda – Breath of the Wild: $39.99</li>
        <li>Gears 5: $29.99</li>
        <li>WWE 2K20: $27.99</li>
        <li>Spiderman: $19.99</li>
        <li>Fallout 76: $12</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Accessories:</b> Unless your controller is broken and you need a new one, it’s always best to just wait until Black Friday to buy them. I might get a Pokeball, too, who knows?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PS4 DualShock Wireless Controllers - colors may vary: $38.99 (save up to $26)</li>
        <li>Turtle Beach Xbox One Headset: $19.99</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Poke Ball Plus Controller: $19.99 ($30 savings)</li>
        <li>Mario &amp; Luigi, Pokémon, GameCube Wireless Controllers: Save up to 50%</li>
      </ul>
