      <p>Last week, Sarah Kobos, a senior photo editor at Wirecutter started a publicly viewable Google spreadsheet for those in the media industry to anonymously share their salaries. The top of the sheet reads, “Talking about how much or how little you make feels taboo, and it shouldn’t Knowledge is power and Glassdoor info is hit or miss. Wouldn’t it be great to know what your peers make so you can use that to leverage a raise?” The spreadsheet, entitled <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SP3Sqqdv6R8chFamjtgdNlOrUar-hJXvkMSeha2mHQ8/edit#gid=0">Real Media Salaries</a>, currently contains more than 1,500 anonymous entries. Along with salary information, the document also details the source’s role, their sex, racial identity and years of experience. While crowdsourced information that comes in at a rate like this can be extremely difficult to fact check, the contents of the sheet can be valuable for those who are more likely to receive unequal pay: women and minorities.  </p>
      <p>The first of these now-viral sheets was created by Alison Green, a management consultant that runs a popular workplace advice site called Ask A Manager. In April, she uploaded a survey that asked participants to identify their industry, job title, age, location, experience and pay. The data feeds into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGCKXIKt-7l5gX06NAwO3pjqEHh-oPXtB8ihkp0vGWo/edit#gid=382484678">a Google sheet</a> which currently counts over 31,000 rows. </p>
      <p>Two months later, Philadelphia Museum of Art assistant curator Michelle Millar Fishers started her own <a href="http://rebrand.ly/salaryspreadsheet">spreadsheet for arts professionals</a>—including gallery, museum, and nonprofit employees—to share their own salary and demographic information. The impressive 19 column spreadsheet currently houses over 3,200 responses and even includes tabs with resources for users, including wage surveys and pivot tables by role and salary. A Philadelphia barista, who is choosing to remain anonymous, learned of the spreadsheet Fishers had created and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oE2avtfGQRuSI1-gltcIw-AazA3ov3dEoX-sTbPI6Jw/edit?fbclid=IwAR1T3ttg8PBZ2Ppi5w2J2R1UfUtF6h3eYUM6u7u6xIte9qdtHUz6T12unIc#gid=0">launched their own</a> for those working in coffee shops and cafes in the city. Other cities have since followed suit with barista salary docs of their own, which are all viewable via <a href="https://twitter.com/teamcoworker/status/1181925189820530689">this Twitter thread</a>. </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, two other spreadsheets have been making the rounds: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BKPkBoyQTiyOpQMDH7jDFyNNP6YJCcVta9TWPKuWdKI/edit?fbclid=IwAR1Ms8b23YSajXpjLNrmh8qV_xIuTKTsvH2YSA0Eda1QErx0hJoYUdVx6ko#gid=0">one for those working at Jewish nonprofits</a>, created by Rabbi Rebecca Sirbu and Sara Shapiro-Plevan and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11obKJpckWJNyEYPdhHM0iaGp0x4QoVk_7aitRC5zVlc/edit#gid=70710369">Real Agency Salaries</a>, launched by account manager Cole Habersham. </p>
      <p>These sheets, which in all likeliness will continue to grow in size and number, are significant because they shed an important light on a problem which we’ve all known exists but, up to this point, has remained nebulous, intangible. While the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/how-we-work/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a>, passed in 1935, clearly states that companies cannot prevent employees from sharing salary information, there’s a cultural taboo that stops people from doing so—effectively halting the conversation and chance for progress. </p>
      <p>Now, thanks to these spreadsheets, onlookers can see instances of two workers with the same title, same credentials but perhaps differing factors of gender, race or sexuality taking home different salaries. Pay disparity is an age-old issue that continues to disproportionately affect women and minorities and, as such, these groups could use any tool available to combat the issue. If that tool just so happens to be a crowdsourced Google sheet filled with rows upon rows of demographic data, we’ll take it because behind every “Anonymous Quokka” and “Nyan Cat” is a person that deserves to know their worth. </p>
