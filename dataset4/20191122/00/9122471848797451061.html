      <h1>Notre Dame Will Wear This Special Uniform For Saturday’s Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:14:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Notre Dame typically never steers from tradition. The Fighting Irish are one of the blue-bloods of college football. But when the players take the field on Saturday, they’ll be wearing an alternate uniform.</p>
      <p>The Fighting Irish are set to don a special throwback – deemed the “Heritage Uniform” – against Boston College. The uniform will honor Notre Dame’s 1988 championship team.</p>
      <p>Under Armour has released a statement regarding the throwbacks:</p>
      <blockquote>“The Fighting Irish will don specialty heritage uniforms that are a nod to the school’s rich football traditions as they take the field against Boston College on Saturday. Sporting the latest ArmourGrid 2.0 technology from Under Armour in throwback fashion, Notre Dame seeks to channel the greatness of the legendary 1988 National Championship sqaud – one of the most prolific college football teams in history – into another W in 2019.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can find the rest of Under Armour’s statement <a href="https://about.underarmour.com/news/2019/11/notre-dame-150th-heritage-uniform">here</a>.</p>
      <p>There are a few subtle changes from Notre Dame’s traditional home uniform. A few of the changes include: “Mesh number detailing, traditional ‘Vegas Gold’ coloring, striking black Under Armour Spotlight cleats and throwback ‘ND’ shoulder patches.”</p>
      <p>Check out a few pics of the alternate uni in the tweet below.</p>

      <p>No. 16 Notre Dame is 8-2, hoping to reach 10 wins during the regular season. The Fighting Irish are still in contention for a NY6 Bowl, but will have to put together convincing wins over Boston College and Stanford the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>Notre Dame-Boston College kicks off this Saturday at 2:30 p.m. ET on NBC.</p>
