      <h1>Study: Trash-Talking Robots Can Hurt Your Delicate Feelings</h1>

      <h3>Smack Talk</h3>
      <p>Not only can robots <a href="https://newatlas.com/epfl-robot-table-soccer-foosball/44863/">beat humans at games</a>, it turns out they can effectively trash talk us during them, too.</p>
      <p>For a new yet-to-be-peer-reviewed <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/trash-talk-hurts-even-when-it-comes-robot">study</a>, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University programmed humanoid robot <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/roundup-ranks-creepy-robots">Pepper</a> to talk smack to humans while playing a strategy game against them — and despite the relatively tame nature of the bot’s insults, it was still able to get into its opponents’ heads and negatively affect their gameplay.</p>
      <h3>Thin Skin</h3>
      <p>As part of the study, 40 participants competed against Pepper in 35 games each of “Guards and Treasures,” a game researchers use to study rationality.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, the robot said encouraging words to its opponents. At other times, it hit them with such scathing insults as “I have to say you are a terrible player” and “Over the course of the game, your playing has become confused.”</p>
      <p>The takeaway? The CMU team found that the human players performed better when the robot encouraged them and worse when it talked trash.</p>
      <h3>Influential AI</h3>
      <p>The knowledge that a robot can affect human rationality with just a few words could prove incredibly valuable as artificial intelligences become more integrated into our society.</p>
      <p>“This is one of the first studies of human-robot interaction in an environment where they are not cooperating,” co-author Fei Fang said in a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2019/november/robot-trash-talk.html">news release</a>, adding that “we can expect home assistants to be cooperative, but in situations such as online shopping, they may not have the same goals as we do.”</p>
