      <h1>Lawsuits Against Toddlers</h1>
      <h2>In America, why do we allow children (as young as four years old) to be sued?</h2>

      </p>
      <p>You are having a wonderful day. You have a lovely house with a large backyard, complete with large, leafy oak trees and a shaded patio with outdoor seating. Your sister has come over for a visit, and she has brought with her a child she has been babysitting—an adorable but mischievous five-year old boy named Brian. You pour a few glasses of lemonade and finish preparing a tray of snacks, before bringing everything out to the backyard. Your sister is watching Brian play in the grass. Turning your back to Brian, you put the food down, and begin speaking to your sister. As you do so, you slowly lower yourself backwards into a lawn chair. Then, suddenly—a shot of adrenaline, a moment of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">panic</a>, and a sickening and painful shock as you hit the ground. Bright, childish <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/laughter">laughter</a> rings out as Brian stands behind the chair, his little hands gripping the wood-and-canvas seat. It takes you a few seconds to realize what has happened: as you were sitting down, Brian had pulled the chair out from under you! Your sister's initial look of surprise melts into concern as she realizes you have been seriously injured by the fall. A wonderful day has been ruined by a childish prank. How sad! And what is there to be done? Is there anything that <i>can </i>be done? After all, what are you going to do—sue a five-year old child?</p>
      <p>For Ruth Garratt, the answer was "yes." The facts above are substantially similar to those in the famous American personal injury case <i>Garratt v. Bailey</i>, 46 Wn.2d 197 (1955). In <i>Garratt v. Bailey</i>, Brian Dailey, who was five years old and nine months, moved a lawn chair on which Ruth Garratt was going to sit. When she did, she fell, sustaining injuries. Garratt brought a lawsuit against the child—not the child's parents, but the child himself—for battery. The courts ultimately ruled that Brian could be liable for Ruth's injuries, because he knew, with substantial certainty, at the time he removed the chair, that Ruth would attempt to sit down where the chair had been. The case law also made clear that children can be assumed to possess knowledge of the normal consequences of their acts, in accordance with their age and experience. Children as young as four years old can be, and have been, sued in court. (Note that the child will always be represented by a adult guardian in the courtroom, either a parent or a guardian appointed by the court. However, the guardian is not personally liable for the judgment against the child, nor is the guardian appearing in his or her individual capacity before the court).</p>
      <p><b>Is it wrong for the legal system to allow lawsuits to be filed against children?</b> Should five-year old boys have judgments issued against them for personal injury?</p>
      <p>While some people may find this harsh, and other may believe it is totally justified, several nuances should be considered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Was the child's act intentional or negligent? Generally speaking, an intentional act is committed on purpose, while a negligent act is the result of carelessness. Most states limit the ability to sue children for negligent acts. (See the next bullet point on the child's age). If the act was intentional, however, the child most likely can be sued as long as he or she is old enough to form intent.</li>
        <li>What is the child's age? Different states have different rules, but in general, if a child is under four years old, it will be very difficult to sue that child for negligence of any kind. Children between the ages of four and eighteen can be sued in many jurisdictions for negligence, but there may be a presumption that they are incapable of understanding certain consequences unless a "reasonable child" of their age (based on other children in similar <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intelligence">intelligence</a> and experience) would understand those consequences. As an example of how this would work, in a 2010 lawsuit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/nyregion/29young.html">reported by the New York Times</a>, a child was sued for striking an elderly woman with her bicycle as she was riding down the street. The child's parents moved to have the child dismissed, arguing "infants under the age of four are conclusively presumed incapable of negligence," but the judge disagreed, noting that the child's age was actually four years <i>and nine months.</i> So the lawsuit against the child was not dismissed. The judge then determined that a child of four years and nine months could probably understand that riding her bike into an elderly person could potentially harm that elderly person.</li>
        <li>What was the child doing? Some courts apply a "reasonable adult" standard upon children if they're engaged in certain "adult" activities. For example, if a child is driving an automobile, then that child will be held to the standards of a reasonable adult.</li>
        <li>Are the child's parents going to be financial responsible for paying damages? Most children have no assets, so what is the benefit of suing them? Almost every state makes parents responsible to some extent, financially, for injuries caused by their children. However, these laws often include a maximum amount that the parents can be liable for. For example, in Washington State, <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=4.24.190">this amount is capped at $5000</a>, even for malicious or intentional acts of the child. However, the parents can be responsible for their own actions (or lack thereof), in addition to being financially responsible for the liability of the child. For example, the child can be sued for battery, and the parent for negligent supervision.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Why are there so many considerations, and why are the laws here so varied and complex? It may have to do with different states creating legislation and case law at different times, based on different facts and different circumstances. However, a large part of it also arises from our society's struggle to answer the difficult question of: "Who is best-situated to bear the cost when a child causes an injury?" <b>Should the child, who has no assets, bear the cost?</b> If not, should the child be absolved of <i>all </i>responsibility, even if he knew what he was doing? <b>Should the child's parents bear the cost?</b> Even if they were completely blameless? Even if there was nothing they could have done to prevent the injury? <b>Or should the injured party bear the cost? </b>Should Ruth Garratt have exercised more caution around wily little five-year old Brian?</p>
      <p>These are not easy questions to answer.</p>

      <p>In my country, the state allows to sue toddlers - orphans - for failing to pay for garbage collecting.</p>
      <p>Immoral?</p>
      <p>Yes, it is.</p>
      <p>So, when those children get out of the orphanage, they are already in debt so big that they can hardly ever solve it.</p>
      <p>State and local authorities are in charge of garbage collecting.</p>
      <p>If some people want to behave ecologically and carefully separate the waste (paper, plastics, glass, etc.) it is usually in vain, since garbage collectors take the waste to one place to dump or burn.</p>
      <p>It would be easy and cheap to introduce a better and more eco-friendly system. HOWEVER - NOBODY<br/>IS FINED AND PUT IN DEBT FOR THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOUR.</p>
      <p>People in responsible positions usually have some kind of diploma - to obtain that diploma - those people have to MAKE AN OATH - in which they solemnly promise that they will use their knowledge for the benefit of society (=mankind).</p>
      <p>HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS OATH CAN BE BROKEN WITHOUT ANY PUNISHNENT???</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Mary Clark on November 23, 2019 - 4:07pm</p>
      <p>One reason why you have this insurance is so it covers situations as described. Normally what will happen is that the aggrieved part will settle, and the insurance will pay. You can have umbrella policies too that can cover stuff that happens that will go above the limits on your homeowners insurance.</p>
      <p>It is wise to have coverage for such things that can, and do, happen over the course of life.</p>
