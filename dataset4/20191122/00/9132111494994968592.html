      <p>The Minister for Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Mr Samuel Kofi Ahiave Dzamesi, has revealed that his Ministry is having behind the scenes discussions with the National House of Chiefs (NHS) to resolve their divided positions on the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>This upcoming local government election is for the citizenry to vote and amend Article 55 (3) of the 1092 Constitution, which is an entrenched one, to pave way for the political parties to participate in local level elections.</p>
      <p>The debate, as to whether to vote yes or no in the referendum, has created divisions in the NHS with the issuance of statements and counter statements about the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote.</p>
      <p>At a press conference, which was organised by the Ministry yesterday in Accra, the Minister said he was aware the chiefs were divided over the issue, and that he was in touch with them to find common ground.</p>
      <p>“It is understood that the National House of Chiefs are divided over this issue. And I want to assure you that as at yesterday, we have started engaging the President, the Vice President of the National House of Chiefs, and very soon, on the 12 of December, they will be having the National House of Chiefs meeting in Kumasi, and we will be there to engage them before the referendum,” Mr. Dzamesi remarked.</p>
      <p>On the issue of taxing churches, he said the government’s intention, for now, is to set up a charity commission, whereby all churches would be registered, and at the end of the year, the commission would look at the work of the churches and how their resources have been used to better the lives of their people.</p>
      <p>Recently, it has been speculated that the government was sponsoring some Christians to embark on pilgrims to the Vatican and Israel. This, the Minister said, was that those embarking on these journeys are doing so with their own resources and that the government was not sponsoring them.</p>
      <p>The Minister also advised all unregistered churches to get registered with any of the larger bodies they fall under, so they could be recognised and their activities well regulated.</p>
      <p>Mr Dzamesi also said his Ministry had adopted to the use of alternative dispute resolution systems to solve the many chieftaincy disputes in the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, most of the chiefs have faith in that, as compared to the law courts, where it takes a longer time for cases to be adjudicated.</p>
      <p>The Ministry has also published a handbook for stakeholders to have knowledge about chieftaincy issues and its effect in the country because the traditional rulers have a huge impact on the society at large.</p>
      <p>The Ministry also highlighted the role it played in resolving the Dagbon chieftaincy disputes and clamping down on illegal mining, popularly known as “Galamsey,” among others.</p>
