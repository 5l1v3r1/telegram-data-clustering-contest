      <p><a href="https://www.derby.ac.uk/">University of Derby</a> fashion graduate Lucy Taylor has won this year’s Young Designer of the Year Award for her womenswear collection called Convergence, a four – outfit collection based around the themes of inclusivity, communication, and travel.</p>
      <p>Lucy’s previous university project looked at raising awareness of Autism and she wanted to continue using the idea of meaningful concepts in this latest collection.</p>
      <p>She said: “After completing my project around Autism last year and looking at inclusive design it was a natural progression for me to explore design for disability. I had been researching into braille and sign language and, from this, formed the inspiration of one united language.”</p>
      <p>Lucy has now set up her own business, Convergence Fashion Ltd, and will be receiving business support and mentoring from the <a href="https://www.derby.ac.uk/">University of Derby</a>’s Be the Boss program, a one-to-one support program providing business advisors to University of Derby students and graduates who want to become self-employed, and hopes to release her first collection since graduation early next year.</p>
      <p>“It's such an exciting opportunity for me, my career and the business I am launching. I was so pleased to be a finalist and have the opportunity to show my collection in front of such influential people.”</p>
      <p>The Midlands Fashion Awards took place at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, where 35 finalists attended the event, alongside industry talent from across the Midlands. “It was such a surprise to win Young designer of the Year, but I'm so glad that all of my hard work has paid off.”</p>
      <p>The judging panel for the event included Carry Somers, Founder and Global Operations Director of Fashion Revolution; Matt Wilson, fashion photographer; Laura Quick, Creative Director at the Central School of Make-up and Rebecca Francis, award-winning makeup artist.</p>
      <p>Fiona Hawthorne, Senior Lecturer in Fashion at the <a href="https://www.derby.ac.uk/">University of Derby</a>, said: “Winning the Midlands Fashion Student Design Awards 2019 is testament to Lucy's commitment to the industry, allowing her concept and outfit realisations to be enjoyed and understood. Bringing more awareness as to the need of inclusivity with meaningful messages that inform or unite.”</p>
      <p>“Lucy's collection brought a much-needed focus on inclusivity. The unpredictable creativity present in her work, emerges from a firm commitment to intelligent design solutions for everyone, bar none. Her collection prototypes and 2D portfolio successfully amalgamate seductive aspects of fashion aesthetics and functionalism, crafted together for inclusivity.”</p>
