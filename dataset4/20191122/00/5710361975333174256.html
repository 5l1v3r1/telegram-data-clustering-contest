      <h1>Forex - Major Currencies Remained Little Changed Amid Mixed Messages on Trade War</h1>

      <p>Investing.com - Major currency pairs were little changed on Friday in Asia amid mixed messages on the Sino-U.S. trade progress.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar index last traded at 97.835 by 1:05 AM ET (05:05 GMT), down 0.04%.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that China has invited top U.S. trade officials including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Beijing for a new round of face-to-face negotiations.</p>
      <p>The report came one day after Reuters said a partial trade deal might not be signed this year.</p>
      <p>While officials from China hinted that Beijing and Washington hinted earlier this month that the two sides are close to signing a deal, U.S. President Donald Trump comments last week that said he did not agree to roll back existing tariffs dampened hopes of a quick trade deal.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-cny">USD/CNY</a> pair, which is usually sensitive to trade news, was little changed at 7.0343.</p>
      <p>"Headline fatigue has set in," said Ray Attrill, National Australia Bank's head of FX strategy, in a Reuters report.</p>
      <p>"With the constant barrage of seemingly contradictory stuff, the market's given up trying to second-guess...seeing is believing, and we'll trade it once we know what's happening."</p>
      <p>On the data front, flash purchasing managers index from Germany, the Eurozone, Britain and the United States are all due later on Friday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/aud-usd">AUD/USD</a> pair and the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/nzd-usd">NZD/USD</a> pair both traded 0.1% higher.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/gbp-usd">GBP/USD</a> pair was also near flat at 1.2916.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-jpy">USD/JPY</a> pair was unchanged at 108.62.</p>
