      <h1>Save $648 on a Samsung Galaxy S10 with Telstra with this exclusive deal</h1>

      <p>Perhaps you’re after a brand new phone, or maybe you’ve broken yours and need a new one. Maybe you just want a Samsung Galaxy S10. Whatever the reason, it’s a great time to save a tonne of money on a new phone from Samsung and Telstra, and this deal is a cracker.</p>
      <p>On a 24 month contract (across a range of plan values) customers can save $648 off the handset price, and that’s a huge saving:</p>
      <p>When you consider that this particular model (Samsung Galaxy S10 128GB) <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/samsung-galaxy-s10-128gb-prism-green-1">retails for $1349 from the likes of JB HiFi</a>, this represents a saving of just under half. Sure, you have to sign up to a Telstra contract to get that saving, but if you’re already a Telstra customer out of contract – or with another carrier and prepared to jump over – this is a huge saving to make.</p>
      <p>These kinds of bargains can usually be found towards the end of the year when Samsung is known to be working on new handsets to launch in a couple of months. For those who don’t buy the newest phone immediately upon its release, huge savings can be made!</p>
