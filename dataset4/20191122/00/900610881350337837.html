      <h1>SAS revamps cube dining boxes with sustainable emphasis</h1>

      <p>SAS has relaunched its cube dining boxes with a new sustainable design.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/features/ten-new-inflight-dining-services/"><b>The innovative boxes were first introduced in 2017</b></a>, and have now been revamped with the aim of saving up to 51 tonnes of plastic waste per year.</p>
      <p>The inside plastic container of the box has been replaced with a Forest Stewardship Council approved paper coated with an organic plant-based plastic instead of oil-based plastics.</p>
      <p>Plant-based cutlery is also being introduced, made from vegetable oil which has been “processed by natural fermentation and micro-organisms into a raw material that is compostable”. SAS says it is the only plastic solution compliant with the European Single Use Plastics directive.</p>

      <p>Going forward the cutlery will be wrapped in napkins made from recycled paper, rather than the previous plastic wrap, and wet wipes will now only be offered on request rather than being placed in all boxes.</p>
      <p>SAS says that its goal is to have “100 per cent sustainable materials in the customer offering no later than 2030”.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/06/05/sas-to-stop-inflight-duty-free-sales/"><b>the airline announced plans to remove inflight duty free sales</b></a>, as part of a target to cut emissions by 25 per cent by 2030.</p>
      <p>“Every day we develop our service offering and constantly evaluate everything we load onboard,” said Karl Sandlund, EVP and chief commercial officer. “We remove what is not needed and work to find innovative solutions for our materials and packaging.”</p>
      <p>“The New Nordic by SAS food concept served in the cube is an excellent example of how we align our onboard services with our sustainability goals. It is one of many steps toward a more sustainable aviation – the most significant actions being the renewal of our fleet, increasing biofuel use and supporting <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/05/22/airbus-to-partner-with-sas-on-hybrid-and-electric-aircraft-research/"><b>the development of electric aircraft</b></a>.”</p>
