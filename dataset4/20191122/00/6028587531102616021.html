          <i>SPOILER ALERT: This review deals with a film about a topic that uses real spoilers!</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari </i>raked in nearly $31.5 million at the box office in its first weekend, No. 1 in the nation, and the fact that the film stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale and had a good storyline and buzz —<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ford_v_ferrari"> 92% on rottentomatoes.com</a> — surely has had a lot to do with its immediate success.</p>
      <p>It is still a movie about auto racing, a sub-genre of the sports-movie genre, and it is a bit of a surprise that it has done as well as it has. The serious auto racing movies (i.e., not <i>The Love Bug, Talladega Nights </i>and the <i>Cars</i> animated series) don’t tend to offer a lot of variety in plots.</p>
      <p>Plus, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is about something that really happened — the Ford Motor Co.’s effort to beat Enzo Ferrari’s brand to win the 24 Hours of LeMans in 1966 — so it would seem there would not be many new details for a race fan who knows racing history.</p>
      <p>So I went to the very first showing of <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> at the multiplex in my town last week expecting to be bowled over mostly by Damon and Bale’s performances in a story that would just touch on racing and would be more about stuff that happened off the track. The story was a little formulaic, but compelling.</p>
      <p>But the racing scenes, some (but not all) enhanced with computer-generated imagery (the stands at the 24 Hours of Daytona are not packed at 4 a.m., for instance), are truly magnificent, evoking the feeling of speed and power without shaking or turning the actual theater seats.</p>
      <p>The movie will be available on pay-per-view soon enough, and commercial TV after that, but it is worth laying down the bucks right now to watch on the big screen. Really.</p>
      <p>James Mangold, the director, did more than just crank up the volume and throw in more revving engines and squealing tires. In fact, some sound effects are subtle, like the light mechanical click when Kenny Miles (Bale) shifts gears while testing and racing the Ford GT40.</p>

      <p>The racing action does not look like races on TV. The scene in the trailer that shows the legendary car builder Carroll Shelby (Damon) taking the big boss, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), for a wild spin in the Ford GT prototype at LAX, probably did not happen. But it effectively conveyed the fact that the car was built to run on the edge and at a speed that would reduce most passengers, us, to mush.</p>
      <p>With a lot of feedback from the colorful Miles (“It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii!” he says after his first test drive of the prototype), Shelby took on a racing project, practically from scratch, that was intended to make the Ford brand, an American brand known to that point as dull but reliable, as fast and durable as the sexy Italian Ferrari.</p>
      <p>Technical challenges were addressed in the film, and not just in mumbo-jumbo ways that fly over the audience’s heads. This was the age before computer: Pieces of wool yarn were taped to the car as it was tested, with the airflow showing the power of the engine in certain areas of the test track. Even some of the kinks in the Ford GT40 that took the track at LeMans had to be ironed out.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the storyline dives into the financial side of auto racing — what compels people in white and blue collars to spend lots of money to design and keep working on a car that is the fastest in its field. (And not all of a manufacturer’s motives are clean and pure, as we see. Men get mad when their feelings are hurt.)</p>
      <p>Ford wins the race after Miles runs a record lap, but a forced and staged stunt done for marketing and public-relations purposes by Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) changes the effect of brilliant technological and personal automotive triumphs by Shelby, Miles and the race team.</p>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is beautifully filmed, with tight, tense shots of the drivers in their cars and low shots of cars on the track. Car buffs will wonder where they got all of those sweet 1960s-era cars to fill the streets of the neighborhood in Los Angeles where Ken Miles lived with his wife and son.</p>
      <p>Racing fans will love <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> because, at its core, the film appreciates why people get involved with fast cars: to find just little more of that precious, elusive speed.</p>
      <p>That thirst had to be quenched through much more primitive ways in 1966 than now, and, much more often than now, chasing that speed often came at great peril, turning racers into <i>explorers</i>.</p>
