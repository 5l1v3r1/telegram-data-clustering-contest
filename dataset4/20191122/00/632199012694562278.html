      <p>DRiiVE Consulting has entered a new strategic partnership with THB and Fleet UK to provide occupational road risk management and telematics services.</p>
      <p>Fleets will undergo intense and continuous risk profiling with the higher risk fleets and drivers highlighted and intervened upon directly.</p>
      <p>The aim will be to identify risk before it has the chance to manifest itself in a fleet’s performance or as an incident.</p>
      <p>“DRiiVE represents a huge move forward in the Occupational Road Risk arena with its proven Interpret and Intervene strategy. We are delighted that DRiiVE will be providing our customers with their highly innovative real time intervention services. This will bring huge benefits to our Policy Holders by reducing their road risk exposure and creating savings in their fleet operations,” said Glen McCully, managing director at THB.</p>
      <p>The new agreement follows THB’s recent partnership with Axa.</p>
      <p>Colin Hartley, managing director at DRiiVE Consulting Limited, said “We are pleased to engage with such prestigious partners as Axa, THB and Fleet UK and support them in their joint quest to reduce casualties on the UK’s roads. Our job is to help their policy holders’ drivers to improve and maintain their driving standards. We do this by using a combination of human intervention and continual professional development strategies. We find that by talking directly with drivers we have a huge effect on their driving behaviour, reducing incidents and collisions which by default, reduces overall fleet operational costs.”</p>
      <p>DRiiVE’s approach combines telemetry with the expertise of its Fleet Analysts and Triage Team. By bringing these elements together, it is able to provide an “Intervene and Improve” approach, to help fleets reduce their exposure to occupational road risk and operational costs.</p>
      <p>The DRiiVE app is an integral part of the company’s solution, providing a seamless interaction between the pre-validation of the driver, the vehicle and ongoing risk management.</p>
      <p>Drivers receive regular impartial, non-confrontational and unbiased feedback regarding their driving behaviour.</p>
