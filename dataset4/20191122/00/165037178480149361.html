        <b>Unai Emery stripped Granit Xhaka of his captaincy after his actions against Crystal Palace. The player is going through a hard time in the ranks of Arsenal. Despite this, the coach has expressed to the club his wish that the Swiss continue in their ranks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alarms were recently triggered by continuing criticism towards <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-xhaka-67187/">Xhaka</a>, which could have<b> made a dent in the player's mental health</b>.</p>
      <p>The incident with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal</a> fans, in which he disrespected the fans, his irregular performances... are factors that have taken his situation at the London club to the extreme.<b> So much so that his departure to Newcastle was rumoured.</b></p>

      <p>Everything seemed to be heading towards a separation between the two aprties. But <b>the unexpected support on Emery's behalf </b>has turned the situation around, as 'The Sun' explained.</p>
      <p>Emery wants the Swiss midfielder in his team and, for the moment, <b>it's going to stay that way</b>. It will be his job to get him back on the right track.</p>
