      <p>There’s no better time to visit the Hudson Valley than Autumn. This special area of upstate New York is home to incredible views, history, great hiking and outdoor activities, quaint bed and breakfasts, distilleries and a burgeoning farm-to-table dining scene. Below are three destinations for those traveling to the Hudson Valley with an appetite for fine dining and quality spirits.<a href="https://www.hillrockdistillery.com/"><b>Hillrock Estate Distillery</b></a></p>
      <p>Situated in the heart of Hudson Valley, just a few hours out of New York City, is Hillrock Estate Distillery in Acram. Perfect for a fall getaway, the Hillrock House overlooks the distant Berkshire Mountains and Appalachian Trail. Visitors are invited to indulge in an afternoon of whiskey tastings at the distillery which offer an unparalleled view of its rolling barley fields making it a lovely place to sit and sip. Its hand-crafted spirits are produced using its onsite Malt House and three different Estate Grains.</p>

      <p>The whiskey, which is aged in fine oak and hand bottles, can be enjoyed with charcuterie and cheese during a distillery tour at the estate. As one of the few “field-to-glass” whiskey producers in the world, in addition to being the first Pre-Prohibition USA distillery to floor malt and hand craft whiskey on site from estate grown grain, it’s a special place to unwind and take in the beauty of the Hudson Valley.</p>

      <p>Built in the 1700’s, The Stissing House features historic and rarely seen architectural features. Most notably, its home to one of only a handful of early 19th century domed ballrooms in the country. Since its opening, it has served as an inn, tavern, restaurant and bawdyhouse for generations of New Yorkers and today remains a popular stop in the Hudson.</p>
      <p>Dining at the Stissing House features weekly specials and seasonal fare. Starters range from cheeses, charcuterie and oysters to escargot and local vegetables. They offer meats and fish off a wood burning grill and entrees that include pan seared duck Margret; braised short ribs with red wine sauce, bok choy and mashed potatoes; moules Frites mariniére with white wine sauce, shallots and thyme; and more.</p>
