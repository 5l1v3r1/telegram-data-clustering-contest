      <h1>Orange The World For The International Day For The Elimination Of Violence Against Women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ewelina U. Ochab</a></address>
      <p>November is an important month for the U.N. and for those working on the issue of combating violence against women and girls. November 25 marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, a U.N. day designated to highlight the issue of violence against women and girls and to call for more action to combat it. Over time, the day has evolved into a global, widespread initiative that now incorporates <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism">16 Days of Activism</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/women/endviolence/">UNiTE</a> campaigns.</p>

      <p>This significant focus on the issue of violence against women and girls is justified by several highly concerning facts about the occurrence of the issue around the world. And the facts are as follows: </p>
      <p>“1 in 3 women and girls experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, most frequently by an intimate partner;</p>
      <p>Worldwide, almost 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday; while 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM);</p>
      <p>1 in 2 women killed worldwide were killed by their partners or family in 2012; while only 1 out of 20 men were killed under similar circumstances;</p>
      <p>71% of all human trafficking victims worldwide are women and girls, and 3 out of 4 of these women and girls are sexually exploited.”</p>
      <p>These facts speak for themselves. These facts cannot be ignored. These facts require an urgent response.</p>
      <p>To address the issue, this year’s theme for the U.N. day is “Orange the World: Generation Equality Stands Against Rape”, placing rape in the centre of the inquiry. Rape is a specific criminal offense that has deep roots in patriarchal beliefs, power and control. It is also a criminal offense that does not end with the act itself. It is often followed by “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/endviolenceday/assets/pdf/UNiTE_Concept_Note_2019_final.pdf">victim-blaming, sexual objectification, trivializing rape, … refusing to acknowledge the harm of sexual harassment or assault</a>.” They are the ultimate denial of crimes perpetrated against the victim and victim’s human dignity. </p>
      <p>A lot can be learnt from the story of Marie Adler, recently portrayed in the Netflix TV series <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80153467"><i>Unbelievable</i></a>. The show highlights how much we have left to achieve in handling such cases, in assisting the victims. Furthermore, campaigns such as #MeToo, #TimesUp, #Niunamenos, #NotOneMore, #BalanceTonPorc and others, have shed more light on the issue of rape and sexual violence and the response to them. However, with all these efforts underway, we are still far behind a change that is needed to give hope to the victims.</p>
      <p>Rape and sexual violence are ever-present crimes that often flourish in impunity as perpetrators benefit from the denial mechanisms set out above, and the stigma that often accompanies the crime. Because of the atmosphere surrounding cases of rape, the exact numbers of the victims is not known. What is known is that rape and sexual violence continue to be widely used, including as a weapon of war in the recent genocides in Iraq and Syria and Myanmar. However, rape is not only present in conflict. According to a survey conducted by the U.N. and released in October 2019 “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/endviolenceday/assets/pdf/UNiTE_Concept_Note_2019_final.pdf">at 33 major universities, about one-quarter of undergraduate women say they have been victims of sexual touching or penetration without consent since starting college</a>.” This is only one example out of many.</p>
      <p>Starting on November 25, and for the next two years, the U.N. Secretary-General’s UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign will focus on the issue of rape as a specific form of harm committed against women and girls in times of peace and war. Among others, the two-year campaign will raise the issues of consent, rape as a weapon of war and the comprehensive response required to assist survivors. The campaign provides important and helpful resources that can assist in building an adequate response to the issue. We must stand up against violence against women and girls. We must stand up against rape. No excuse.</p>
