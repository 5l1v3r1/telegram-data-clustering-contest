        <b>A KNIFEMAN who stabbed a rival in the bum in a gala day clash has been told he faces a prison sentence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lewis Findlay, 20, was found guilty after trial of assaulting Connor McClung to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement at Whitburn Gala Day in West Lothian on 23 June last year.</p>

      <p>A jury at Livingston Sheriff Court returned a majority verdict convicting him of serious assault and unanimously found him guilty of possessing a knife in a public place.</p>
      <p>He was cleared of assaulting another man, Peter Brown by striking him on the chest with a knife to the danger of his life after the jury found the charge not proven.</p>
      <p>He was earlier acquitted of causing a drunken disturbance by brandishing a wooden pole and damaging a wall at a house in High Academy Street in nearby Armadale the same day after the prosecution withdrew the charge.</p>
      <p>Findlay, of Jubilee Road, Whitburn, who had denied all the charges, wept in the dock as the jury’s verdicts were read out.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Kenneth Maciver called for background reports and told Findlay to return to court for sentence next year.</p>
      <p>He warned the accused: “You now stand convicted of charges for being in possession of a knife and for stabbing an individual with that knife.</p>
      <p>“You should understand that you face custody for that. Be in no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>“In spite of that I’m satisfied that your bail should be continued until a report is ready and you are sentenced and that will be on 6 January.”</p>
