      </p>
      <p>The neobank has traditionally struggled to hold on to its risk and compliance chief executives. Chief information security officer (CISO) <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/11/revolut-ciso-leaves-after-two-months-on-the-job/">Dinis Cruz left</a> after just two months in early November 2019, and since 2016 the challenger has also lost two chief risk officers, a chief compliance officer and two money laundering reporting officers.</p>
      <p>As its new CRO, Pierre will head up Revolut’s global risk function as it expands globally and develops new product lines such as credit and Revolut Youth.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the CRO’s years of experience, Revolut’s founder and CEO Nik Storonsky says his appointment “is a major coup in our continued mission to become the world’s first truly global bank”.</p>
      <p>Now with more than eight million customers worldwide, the digital bank is gearing up for a $500 million funding round to support its expansion into <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/revolut-reveals-new-agreement-with-visa-set-to-hire-3500/">eight new countries</a> before the end of this year.</p>
