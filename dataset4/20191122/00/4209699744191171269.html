      <p>Legal icon and Senior Advocate of Nigeria,  Afe Babalola, has said that civil servants are the country's main problem. </p>
      <p>Babalola, who spoke in Ibadan, Oyo State, during the conferment of Honorary Doctor of Letters on him by the University of Ibadan, said he turned down two ministerial appointments because he didn't want to work with civil servants. </p>
      <p>According to him, the type of civil servants Nigeria had was capable of making him have enemies if he had accepted the offer to serve as a minister.</p>
      <p>He said, “Well, I turned ministerial appointments down for two reasons.</p>
      <p>“One, I cannot work with the present type of civil servants in this country. </p>
      <p>"The civil servants are the problems in this country. </p>
      <p>"None of them can work the way I work. </p>
      <p>"I will create instant enemies if I had accepted to be a minister.</p>
      <p>“The second reason was that my clients are so many. </p>
      <p>"They protested and felt I would be disappointing them if I accepted to be a minister.”</p>
