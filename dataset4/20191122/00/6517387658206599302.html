      <p>Westlife cement their triumphant comeback this week as their new album Spectrum debuts at Number 1 on the Official Albums Chart.</p>
      <p>The group’s first studio album in nine years becomes their eighth record to top the UK albums chart, shifting 63,000 chart sales this week across physical, download and streaming formats.</p>
      <p>Celebrating the news, Westlife told us: "Thank you so much to everyone in the UK who’s made Spectrum Number 1 this week! We can’t believe that after 21 years we’ve got another Number 1 - our eighth Number 1 album. The reunion has been going so well, thank you for everything."</p>
      <p>Westlife last topped the Official Chart in 2007 with Back Home. In their 20 years together, the group have racked up an incredible eight chart-topping albums and 14 Number 1 singles. <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/7712/westlife/">View Westlife's full Official UK Chart history</a>.</p>
