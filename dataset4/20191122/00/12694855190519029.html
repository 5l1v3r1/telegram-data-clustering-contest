        <b>We’re well and truly getting into the swing of Black Friday with the launch of Amazon’s Black Friday sales event. Seeing discounts left, right and centre, this Huawei Watch GT isn’t one to be overlooked. Reduced by a total of £100, pick up this smart watch for just £99.99.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thinking about getting ahead of the game with your New Years resolutions? Black Friday is most certainly the time to make the most of some incredible offers, especially the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-3934697">best Amazon Black Friday deals</a> on wearables that’ll whip you into shape. The Huawei Watch GT is no exception to the rule.</p>
      <p>We continually check thousands of prices to show you the best deals. If you buy a product through our site we will earn a small commission from the retailer – a sort of automated referral fee – but our reviewers are always kept separate from this process.

      <p>We awarded the Huawei Watch GT a 7 out of 10 rating back when it went for the much higher price of £199.99, but at half the price, the device has become a much easier recommendation all-round.</p>
      <p>A great partner to your exercise regime, the Huawei Watch GT is definitely a worthy fitness tracker, pledging to offer a 14-day battery life that far outruns a lot of wearables out there, allowing you to exert yourself for longer before your watch needs to plug-in.</p>
      <p>This means gaining a broader range of stats to paint a bigger picture of your physical health with the ability to track the likes of calories burned, steps taken and the specific exercises you carry out day to day. It will also monitor your heart rate 24/7, track sleep and even includes personalised coaching.</p>
      <p>Convienently strapped to your wrist, all this data is displayed on the Huawei Watch GT’s stunning AMOLED touchscreen, allowing you to notify your watch when you’re about to work up a sweat, as well as receiving notifications like texts from your phone.</p>
      <p>With a classic circular face made from stainless steel, the Huawei Watch GT also manages to blend itself in with a more traditional analogue watch if you prefer your fitness tracker to be a touch more discreet, rather than the sometimes obnoxious smartwatches on the market these days.</p>

      <p>5ATM water resistant and with GPS tracking, no matter what activity you’re throwing yourself into, the Huawei Watch GT is a reliable wearable that will help you to see results with your fitness goals. If your soul focus is to get motivated and become more active, we’d deem this a worthy choice, noting in our review: “The Huawei Watch GT is a competent running watch, but its smart functionality needs work.”</p>
      <p>The first time the Huawei Watch GT has slipped below the £100 mark, there’s no time like the present to pick up this absolute steal. As is the nature with Black Friday deals, this Amazon special isn’t likely to stay at this low price for long. In fact, you can only buy the Huawei wearable at this price until midnight tonight.</p>
