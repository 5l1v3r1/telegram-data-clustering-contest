      <p>Civil society organization, Right Alliance-Africa, is backing the ‘No’ campaign in the upcoming December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>The group said in a press release that a ‘Yes’ vote will not only be a failure to efforts to de-monetise elections at the local level, but will also exclude persons who are not politically inclined to participate in assembly decisions.</p>
      <p>“Partisan politics in our local governance will mean that non-partisan members in community will be marginalized in society. And the effect of community development will be missed, barring competent persons the opportunity to participate in decision making at the local governance level,” the group said.</p>
