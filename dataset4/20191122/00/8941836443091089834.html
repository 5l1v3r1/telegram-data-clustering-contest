      <p>BOSTON (AP) - An investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse at a seminary run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston did find some “inappropriate” sexual conduct but no evidence of criminal behavior or sexual activity between seminarians and faculty members.</p>
      <p>The investigation was launched in August when two seminarians said in social media posts that St. John’s Seminary in Brighton tolerated illicit sexual behavior and excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
      <p>The archdiocese said in a statement Friday the investigation also found inadequate and sometimes absent leadership and oversight, which contributed to a lack of robust financial controls and a low tolerance for dissenting views.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Sean O’Malley in a statement said many of the recommendations in the final report have already been implemented.</p>
