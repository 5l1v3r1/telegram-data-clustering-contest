      <h2>Tree and Woodland Scene is part of baby sensory room development</h2>

      <p>Artwork created by service users at <a href="https://www.derbyshirehealthcareft.nhs.uk/">Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust</a> has been highly praised by the judge in a national art competition.</p>
      <p>The ‘Tree and Woodland Scene’ project was part of the development of the baby sensory room at<a href="https://www.derbyshirehealthcareft.nhs.uk/services/mental-health-and-emotional-wellbeing/perinatal-mother-and-baby-services"> The Beeches</a>, the Trust’s perinatal unit in Derby, and has now received a Highly Commended certificate in the Care Coordination Association’s annual Art and Photographic Competition.</p>
      <p>With support from Trust Nursery Nurse Kath Thomas and Jane Hardstaff, Creative Wellbeing Coordinator from The Quad in Derby, the mums on the mother and baby unit planned how they would redecorate the room.</p>
      <p>Together they came up with the idea of a woodland scene with a big tree that they would populate with animals. Kath said: “I think we are all pleased with how the scene has turned out – it’s really cheerful, and it’s great that so many mums have contributed.</p>
      <p>“The mums on the unit enjoyed being involved in planning the design, and making the owls, butterflies and flowers which Jane from The Quad helped to design and organise. It's made the room look bright and interactive and has helped to encourage the mums to bring their babies in to the room for the sensory play sessions, which support bonding and attachment.”</p>
      <p>And Shelley Brough, Senior Perinatal Nurse at <a href="https://www.derbyshirehealthcareft.nhs.uk/services/mental-health-and-emotional-wellbeing/perinatal-mother-and-baby-services">The Beeches</a>, commented: “The woodland scene has made a lovely addition to our ward’s sensory room. It was great to see staff and patients to work together collaboratively to create it. Babies and families love the display which is really rewarding for those involved.”</p>
      <p>The competition was judged by illustrator Naomi Tipping. The art work, along with that of other winners, can be seen on the Care Coordination Association website.</p>
      <p>Naomi said: “The Tree and Woodland Scene was highly commended because it is a brilliant collaboration. You told your own stories which together make this hopeful and cheerful image. I loved the theme of the mother and baby owl – the baby owls are ready to start their journey, with the mother owls protecting and helping them all the way.”</p>
      <p>The perinatal unit, which supports women experiencing mental health problems either ante- or post-natally, continues to benefit from partnership working with <a href="https://www.derbyquad.co.uk/">The Quad</a> in Derby and its Creative Wellbeing Project.</p>
