      <p><b>the design for the site of approximately 75,000 square meters was developed by <a href="https://oma.eu/">OMA</a> for <a href="https://www.beingdevelopment.com/">being development</a>, together with <a href="https://www.diederendirrix.nl/en/">diederendirrix</a>, <a href="https://www.fabrications.nl/">FABRICations</a>, landscape architect <a href="https://delva.la/">DELVA</a>, and designer collective <a href="https://nulzes.info/">NUL ZES</a>.</b> <i>‘VDMA offers a unique opportunity to revive a centrally located site in eindhoven that is full of potential,’</i> says david gianotten. <i>‘our plan builds on the history and assets of the city as a center for technological innovation and industrial design, and introduces exciting public programs to the area. the redeveloped VDMA-site will offer the city a platform for engagement with the most innovative ideas in technology and culture.’</i></p>

      <p><b>the masterplan proposes to re-purpose historically significant structures as cultural spaces, while creating new buildings for residential and office use.</b> a match factory from the 19th century will be restored to its original state to house cultural, education, and retail programs, while a former garage will be transformed into a flexible public space for exhibitions, events, and theater performances. occupying one-third of the site, a micro forest, comprised of different vegetation species from eindhoven’s surroundings, will serve as a reminder of the city’s natural resources.</p>

      <p><b>new residential buildings are designed as stacked volumes which correspond to varying scales of the site’s context, while the lower blocks have glass façades that evoke eindhoven’s industrial architecture.</b> importantly, the façades of the upper volumes will be installed with sustainable features, including green walls, and kinetic photovoltaic panels that optimize solar gain throughout the day.</p>

      <p><b>the housing blocks provide a combination of social housing, averagely-priced rental properties, private sector houses, and a community home.</b> meanwhile, a five-storey volume with large floor plates wrapping around the micro forest, will offer co-working spaces for tech startups. a public route will connect all cultural, retail, and open spaces in the urban hub at different levels and link VDMA to the rest of the city center.</p>
