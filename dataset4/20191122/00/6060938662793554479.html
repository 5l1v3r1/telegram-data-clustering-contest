      <p>The best thing about sweaters is their versatility. They can be worn in different ways. From pairing it with a collared tee to styling it under a jacket, there are numerous ways to style this humble piece. Currently, we're taking winter style inspiration by Bollywood's most fashionable star Sonam Kapoor.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old actress wore a red coloured sweater by Bhaane featuring a quirky logo. She styled the comfy pullover with a high-neck dress, which seemed as if she was wearing a skirt. The actress went for a blue coloured pleated dress, which complemented the sweater's logo art.</p>

      <p>The round neck gave us a peek of the high-neck detail of the dress. Sonam took the style up a notch and accessorised it with a silver neckpiece with matching earrings. For her make-up, she sported soft smokey eyes with nude lips. And, when it came to her hairdo, she flaunted her naturally-straight hair with a middle parting.</p>
      <p>She completed her look with black boots and looked winter ready! What do you think of Sonam's look? Let us know in the comment section below.</p>
