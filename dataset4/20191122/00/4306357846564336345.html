      <h3>Ashley Cole has admitted that he was “a little bit shocked” by Tottenham Hotspur’s decision to appoint Jose Mourinho as their new manager.</h3>
      <p>Spurs parted company with Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff on Tuesday night and officially confirmed Mourinho as Spurs’ new manager on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes over at Spurs with the Lilywhites down in 14th place in the Premier League table and having only won three of their opening 12 games in the top flight this term.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach’s first game in charge of the Lilywhites will be their trip to West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea FC star Cole, who played under Mourinho during his first spell at Stamford Bridge, has admitted he was surprised to see Spurs move to appoint the former Blues boss this week.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <i>talkSPORT</i>, Cole said: “I’m a little bit shocked to be honest. Obviously he was a Chelsea man and then went to Man United, and now he’s back.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate the work he did at Chelsea and what he tried to do at Man United, and this is going to be a tough test for him. It is something different for him But I think he will do well; he is a great coach and a great manager.</p>
      <p>“When people talk about that sort of stuff [being a Chelsea man], when they talk about rivalry, at the end of the day he wants a job and wants to get back into work. It’s a great job for him to take.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see why not [he can’t win trophies. Whether it is going to come sooner rather than later is the question people will ask.</p>
      <p>“With his qualities and experience – he knows how to win – it’s going to be interesting to see how that develops.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action on Saturday night when they travel to Manchester City in the top flight.</p>
      <p>The west London side currently find themselves in third place in the Premier League table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC after 12 games of the new campaign.</p>
