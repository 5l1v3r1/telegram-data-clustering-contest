      <p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Former South African president Jacob Zuma has filed notice to appeal a court ruling that cleared the way for him to be prosecuted for corruption.</p>
      <p>Zuma’s lawyers are arguing in Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday to be granted leave to appeal.</p>
      <p>The court had dismissed his application to have the corruption case against him permanently halted.</p>
      <p>Zuma has alleged his case was prejudiced by lengthy delays in bringing the matter to trial. He also has alleged political interference.</p>
      <p>He denies charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering related to the country’s controversial 1999 arms deal.</p>
      <p>Zuma is accused of receiving bribes from French arms manufacturer Thales through his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted of fraud and corruption in 2005.</p>
