      <p>National Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Samuel Ofosu Ampofo, has said it is unfortunate there is a glaring division among members of the National House of Chiefs over the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>The referendum is to amend the constitution to allow elections at local assemblies to be partisan.</p>
      <p>A statement signed by the President of the House of Chiefs, Togbe Afede XIV, declaring a ‘No’ vote position in an impending referendum has divided the traditional leaders.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a short ceremony to mark the visit of Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, to former President John Mahama, the NDC Chairman said the unprecedented public disagreements between the members of the National House of Chiefs must be repaired quickly.</p>
      <p>The visit by Asantehene to the Cantonment office of former President Mahama on Friday is proof of the cordial and mutually respectful relationship between Asantehene and the NDC, the opposition party has said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofosu Ampofo clarified that the visit by the respected king of the Ashanti people was not to discuss the controversy that Otumfuo's speech to the UN stirred in September this year.</p>
      <p>In that speech, the Asantehene said it took the intervention of the Manhyia Palace for the loser in the last election to concede defeat and keep the peace.</p>
      <p>The comments drew a response from Mr Mahama's Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah.</p>
      <p>The NDC said if anyone thought the spat strained longstanding relations between the party and the king, his visit proved the opposite.</p>
      <p>Asantehene engaged the former President in a 30-minute closed-door meeting.</p>
