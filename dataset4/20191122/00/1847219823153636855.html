        <b>Opposition parties in Riga City Council have collected the necessary 20 signatures to initiate the dismissal of Mayor Oļegs Burovs, as reported by <i>For Latvia’s Development</i> party’s representative Ieva Graudiņa-Šutko.</b>
      </p>
      <p>«We can see Burovs failing at managing the city council. This is why the decision has been made to request his dismissal,» she said.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the Law on Local Governments, a meeting for non-confidence vote towards a city council chairman is to be organized within two weeks.</p>
      <p>When asked why the opposition decided to «go the long way» instead of organizing extraordinary meetings in a single day, Vilnis Ķirsis explained that «Burovs may as well organize the meeting tomorrow».</p>
      <p>He did not comment why the opposition has picked such a tactic, nor did he say if the opposition would even participate and vote at such a meeting.</p>
      <p>Dainis Locis said this way the opposition will test Burovs’ ability to secure majority of votes.</p>
      <h3>«We want to see if Burovs truly no longer has support from a single independent deputy, because variants are different. We do not lose anything in this game, because if he has votes, so be it, if he doesn’t, we will get snap elections,» says Locis.</h3>
      <p>When asked if the case turns out the opposition «turns fur to the other side» and intentionally avoids snap elections, both city council members said no, adding that «it is part of their tactic».</p>
      <p>Previously, most opposition representatives had voiced the opinion that they want snap elections, and one of the ways to secure this is organizing three meetings in a row without a quorum in each one.</p>
      <p>In spite of the fact that on Tuesday, 19 November, Vice-mayor Vadims Baraņņiks was dismissed, ruining the advantage in votes the coalition once had, the opposition has not used this option until now.</p>
      <p>Riga City Council deputy chairman Annas Vladova’s dismissal, on the other hand, is not requested.</p>

      <p>The minority coalition in Riga City Council is composed of <i>Harmony</i> and <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i>, which have 28 votes. The opposition has 24 votes – eight from <i>For Latvia’s Development</i>, seven from <i>New Conservative Party</i>, five from the <i>National Alliance «All for Latvia-For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK»</i> and four from <i>Unity</i>.</p>
      <p>There are also eight independent deputies in the city council. The <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i> consists of four ex-<i>Harmony</i> members, four <i>For Riga!</i> bloc deputies, ex-<i>For Latvia’s Development</i> member Oskars Putniņš, as well as ex-<i>New Conservative Party</i> members Imants Keišs and Druvis Kleins. There is also Baiba Broka, who has halted her work in the National Alliance following the corruption scandal at the University of Latvia.</p>
