        <b>American golfer Webb Simpson set the pace on day one of the PGA Tour tournament in Georgia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Webb Simpson carded a seven-under-par 65 to lead the RSM Classic after the opening round.</p>
      <p>Simpson was almost flawless as the American golfer earned a one-stroke lead in Georgia on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Playing on Sea Island’s Plantation Course – the easier of the two courses used this week – Simpson overcame a slow start, which saw him bogey his second hole.</p>
      <p>Simpson was one over par before playing his final 13 holes in eight under to take the first-round lead ahead of Cameron Tringale and Lee Kyoung-hoon – who each played on the Seaside Course – and Rhein Gibson.</p>

      <p>“He told me, no matter how I started out, to stay patient,” Simpson said of caddie Paul Tesori’s advice. “I think he knew scores would be good over there [on the Plantation Course]. He helped me weather the storm.”</p>
      <p>Simpson – a five-time PGA Tour champion without a win since May 2018 – carded six of his eight birdies on his back nine, closing out the round with three in a row.</p>
      <p>“It’s been awhile since I’ve won,” 2012 U.S. Open winner Simpson said. “I’ve given myself chances here. Starting this week, all I wanted was a chance Sunday because I do feel comfortable here.”</p>
      <p>Scott Harrington, Tyler Duncan, Brian Harman, Alex Cejka, Rory Sabbatini, Scott Brown, Sebastian Munoz, Nick Taylor and Hank Lebioda are five under heading into the second round.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, defending champion Charles Howell III is five strokes off the pace.</p>
