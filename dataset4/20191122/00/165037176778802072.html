        <b>Gareth Bale's actions after Wales qualified for Euro 2020 caused uproar in Spain, and the Real Madrid forward's agent responded.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gareth <b>Bale's agent </b>Jonathan <b>Barnett </b>said the Real Madrid star's "<b>WALES</b>. <b>GOLF</b>. <b>MADRID</b>… <b>IN THAT ORDER</b>" flag celebration was "<b>meant for the media</b>" amid backlash.</p>
      <p>Bale caused a stir in <b>Cardiff </b>on Tuesday, when he was pictured laughing and celebrating in front of a fan-made banner after <b>Wales</b> qualified for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Tipped to leave <b>Madrid </b>and <b>criticised </b>for his priorities amid his love for golf, Wales fans have adopted the chant, "Wales, golf, Madrid", which was heard during the international break.</p>
