      <p>Thefts of catalytic converters have increased tenfold from the beginning of the year, according to new insurance data.</p>
      <p>Data compiled by AA insurance services found that in January 2019, eight vehicles had their catalytic converters stolen compared to 79 which were stolen during October.</p>
      <p>Some drivers were severely unlucky and had their catalytic converters stolen twice which required them to make two separate insurance claims.</p>

      <p>Despite catalytic converter thefts making up a small proportion of insurance claims as a whole, the number of instances has been on the increase since January 2018.</p>
      <p>March 2018, for instance, saw three catalytic converters stolen whereas a year later in 2019, this had increased to 10. April was another month with a significant increase from two thefts in 2018 to 19 in 2019.</p>
      <p>Janet Connor, managing director for AA insurance services says; “A tenfold increase in claims for catalytic converters due to theft is a shocking revelation.</p>
      <p>“Criminals are being bold and brash by stealing converters in broad daylight, as they believe passers-by won’t question someone tinkering underneath a car.</p>
      <p>“Where possible, drivers should park in a garage or in a well-lit area. Manufacturers have also developed anti-theft devices which can be attached to the fixings and give the converter a unique serial number. Concerned drivers should contact their dealer for further information.</p>
      <p>“Scrap dealers and online auction sites have a role to play too, by making appropriate checks to ensure the parts being sold or scrapped have not been illegally gained.”</p>
      <p>Catalytic converters are removed from vehicles because they contain precious metals such as palladium, rhodium and platinum. As a result, they are often sold for strong scrap values or traded privately.</p>
