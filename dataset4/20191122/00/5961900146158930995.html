      <p>NRL player <b>Tyrone May</b> has pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including filming a sex tape without the other person’s consent.</p>
      <p>May was l<a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/tyrone-may-penrith-panthers-sex-tape-arrest/">ast year charged with eight counts of capturing and disseminating intimate footage of two women</a> in separate incidents in Coffs Harbour and Kingswood.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/tyrone-may-sex-tape-panthers-player-pleads-guilty-to-four-charges-nsw-news/be05b814-3433-41d9-a6b8-3ac6c6f26099">Nine News</a> reports the Penrith Panthers player, 23, today agreed to a plea deal in which prosecutors dropped four charges, including the charges relating to sharing the videos.</p>
      <p>The victims were reportedly notified of the footage by friends and family members after it was shared on social media.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/cowboys/penrith-panther-tyrone-may-pleads-guilty-to-four-charges-in-sex-tape-case/news-story/50b596456effd8f786b803a5e46c5cde">The Herald Sun</a> reports neither woman was aware they were being filmed, and neither consented to the material being shared online.</p>
      <p>May was one of the first NRL players sidelined as a result of the league’s new no-fault stand down rules, which prevent athletes from competing after being charged with a criminal matter.</p>
      <p>He did not play a match during the 2019 season, but maintained his training regimen with the side.</p>
      <p>The offence of recording without consent carries a maximum three-year jail term.</p>
      <p>He will face sentencing on January 31.</p>
