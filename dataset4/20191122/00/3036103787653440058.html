      <h1>Rain launches online RICA process</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Rain has recently launched an online RICA process which removes the need to physically wait for a RICA-certified agent to activate a SIM.</p>
      <p>The Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act 70 of 2002 (<a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cellular/207822-rica-challenged-in-south-africa.html"><b>better known as RICA</b></a>) came into effect on the 1 July 2011.</p>
      <p>RICA aims to combat organised crime by ensuring that telecoms providers collect and keep records of all their customers, which include ID numbers and residential addresses.</p>
      <p>Service providers are obligated to verify that the information which they collect are accurate. This is typically done by the person involved in the RICA process.</p>
      <p>Until now, it was necessary for people to go to a physical store or wait for a RICA agent to visit them to activate a SIM or other telecoms service.</p>
      <p>Rain has changed this process by allowing its new subscribers to RICA and activate their SIM through an easy-to-use online process.</p>
      <h3>Rain’s online RICA process</h3>
      <p>Rain’s chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga told MyBroadband that new Rain customers can visit the company’s website and follow three easy steps to activate their SIM:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your SIM’s unique code.</li>
        <li>Create a Rain account.</li>
        <li>RICA online.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“A customer will have to have a valid South African identity document and a proof of residence that is no more than 3 months old,” Dlanga said.</p>
      <p>He explained that with Rain’s online RICA, customers no longer have to physically wait for a RICA certified agent to activate their SIM.</p>
      <p>“They can RICA and activate their SIM from the comfort of their home, the beach, or a bus bench. Anywhere,” said Dlanga.</p>
      <p>He said the response to the online RICA process has been positive so far, and that it has been especially helpful to those customers who purchased <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cellular/327475-rain-uncapped-4g-now-available-on-takealot.html"><b>Rain SIMs through Takealot</b></a>.</p>
