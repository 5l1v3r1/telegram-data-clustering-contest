      <p>Union Minister Nitin Gadkari onÂ November 22 said the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre made the country proud by abrogating Article 370 in Kashmir, as the special status granted to the Valley "posed a challenge to India's unity".</p>
      <p>Addressing a poll meeting here in Palamu, Gadkari said abolition of articles 370 and 35 A had featured on the agenda of the Jan Sangh and the BJP since Independence.</p>
      <p>He alleged that the erstwhile Congress governments did not take any measure to scrap the special provisions in Kashmir as they were afraid of losing votes.</p>
      <p>"Why is that the Congress and the so-called secular parties never touched Article 370? They were afraid of losing votes. The special status had always posed a challenge to the unity of the country.</p>
      <p>"We are proud that the Modi government took the bold and decisive step," the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises said.</p>
      <p>The senior BJP leader also hailed the Modi government for its efforts to ban the practice of instant 'triple talaq'.</p>
      <p>"It is an issue of social justice. The move to ban instant 'triple talaq' should not be viewed through the prism of religion and politics," he asserted.</p>
      <p>Attacking the opposition alliance of the JMM, the Congress and the RJD in the state, Gadkari said the coalition was a temporary one and that people should avoid voting for a 'khichri' government.</p>
      <p>"The Raghubar Das-led BJP government has provided good governance over the past five years. A 'khichri' government only puts roadblocks in the path of development," he added.</p>
      <p>Assembly elections will be held in Jharkhand in five phases. Bishrampur goes to polls during the first phase on November 30.</p>
      <p>The BJP has fielded sitting MLA and the state's health minister, Ramchandra Chandravanshi, from the seat.</p>
