      <p>Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Akuapem North in the Eastern Region, Dennis Edward Aboagye, has upbraided the National Democratic Congress (NDC) for their campaign against a YES vote in the upcoming referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Aboagye expressed fret over NDC’s position, describing it as “hypocritical”, “duplicitous” and “traitorous”.</p>
      <p>He wants the general public to reject their NO campaign.</p>
      <p>At a press conference last week, the country’s largest opposition party detailed its position against the YES vote in the December 17 referendum, which seeks to amend Article 55(3) of the 1992 constitution and to introduce partisan politics at the local level.</p>
      <p>According to the NDC, its position is not particularly against the election of metropolitan, municipal and district chief executives (MMDCEs) but wants government to recoil on its position in making election at the local level partisan-based.</p>
      <p>Their move was followed with impassioned arguments among the vast majority of Ghanaians including traditional rulers, political parties and other stakeholders over the YES or NO vote.</p>
      <p>But speaking on Onua FM’s ‘Mantam Mpuntuo’ hosted by Nana Yaw Opare (Wofa), the AKuapem North MCE censured the NDC over their sudden and sham move and labeled them as pretenders.</p>
      <p>“Anyone campaigning for NO vote might have not lived in the country or may be hating the hard truth.</p>
      <p>“Non-partisan elections in Ghana are not practical and possible and cannot work at the local governance system,” he reiterated.</p>
      <p>He cited his municipal assembly as a typical area where the existing non-partisan local governance system has not worked as both the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and NDC have been clandestinely electing candidates to contest the district assembly elections.</p>
      <p>Dennis Aboagye backed his position and called on all and sundry to massively vote YES come December 17 to help deepen Ghana’s democracy especially at the local level in facilitating and accelerating development and accountability.</p>
