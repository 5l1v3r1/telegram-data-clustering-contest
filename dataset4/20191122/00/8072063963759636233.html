      <p><b>(GUYANA CHRONICLE) –</b> WEEKS after 45-year-old Selwyn Lancaster was sentenced to 15 years in prison, for raping a six-year-old girl in 2018, and also engaging in sexual activity with her, he has filed an appeal to challenge his conviction and sentence.</p>
      <p>On October 29, 2019, Lancaster was sentenced by Justice Simone Morris-Ramlall, at the Sexual Offenders Court at the High Court, for rape of a child under the age of 16 and sexual activity.</p>
      <p>The first charge stated that, on October 6, 2018, in Linden, he engaged in sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16.</p>
      <p>The second charge alleged that, on November 6, 2018, Lancaster engaged in sexual activity with the child, by touching her vagina.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment on the first charge and 7 years’ imprisonment for the second charge. Justice Morris-Ramlall had ordered that the sentences run concurrently.</p>
      <p>Lancaster’s attorneys, Gordon Gilhuys and Yondessa Welcome-Mercurius, moved to the appeal court and filed an appeal to challenge their client’s conviction and sentence.<br/>One of the grounds of the appeal was that Justice Morris-Ramlall made an error in summing up the evidence to the jury.</p>
      <p>Another ground stated that the trial judge misdirected the jury when she proposed to them that she would not read all the evidence while summing up.<br/>Further, Lancaster’s attorneys are arguing that the Judge’s ‘summing up’ was not balanced and favoured to the prosecution.</p>
      <p>The court of appeal is yet to set a date in this matter.</p>
