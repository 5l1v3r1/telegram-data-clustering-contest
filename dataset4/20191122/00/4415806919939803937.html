      <p>Selena Gomez has announced the release date for her latest album.</p>
      <p>The pop star’s as-yet-untitled third record will arrive on January 10 next year, she said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>It will be Gomez’s first album since 2015’s Revival. Gomez said: “This album is my diary from the past few years and I can’t wait for you to hear it.”</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old said the title, art and track list are “coming soon”.</p>
      <p>Last month Gomez released two songs from the album, including the ballad Lose You To Love Me, widely believed to have been written about her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber.</p>
      <p>In June, former Disney Channel star Gomez appeared on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show and said she had nearly completed the long-awaited album.</p>
      <p>“I’m just relieved,” Gomez said. “It took me four years now to even feel at a good place with this album and it’s just because I had such huge moments that happened in my life personally that, how was I gonna capture that and how was I gonna feel good about what I was saying? So, I just kept going and I’m relieved.”</p>
      <p>The “huge moments” she has experienced include being diagnosed with the autoimmune disease lupus, undergoing a kidney transplant and her break-up with Bieber.</p>
