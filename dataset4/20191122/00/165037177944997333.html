        <b>Thomas Tuchel has had to cope without Kylian Mbappe and Neymar for chunks of the season but both men are in the squad to take on Lille.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Neymar and Kylian Mbappe</b> are back in the <b>Paris Saint-Germain</b> squad to face Lille in Ligue 1 on Friday.</p>
      <p>Both of Thomas Tuchel's star forwards have endured <b>injury interrupted campaigns so far.</b></p>
      <p>Neymar missed the start of the season as he completed his <b>rehabilitation from ankle ligament damage</b> but returned in style with four goals in five Ligue 1 outings.</p>
      <p>A hamstring injury sustained while on duty with Brazil last month left him back on the sidelines but Tuchel told reporters on Thursday the <b>world's most expensive footballer had resumed training</b>.</p>
      <p>Mbappe has nine goals in 11 games across all competitions in 2019-20 despite being compromised by hamstring, thigh and adductor problems, before illness placed his participation in theÂ game at the Parc des Princes in doubt.</p>
