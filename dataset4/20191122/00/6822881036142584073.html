      <p>In this role, Strudwick will oversee Sonovate’s product roadmap, driving forward the technology that has already transformed thousands of businesses using contingent workers, including recruitment agencies, consultancies and on-demand marketplaces, to unlock their true growth potential.</p>
      <p>Strudwick brings with him over 30 years’ experience, most recently with online fashion retailer ASOS, where he was promoted to become the company’s first CTO in 2015.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his new role, Strudwick comments: “I’d known about the innovative work that Sonovate was doing in the fintech space for a while. I liked its vision and the boldness of the company’s plans to transform the entire contingent worker market. It has a great technology team, one that I’m already building on and strengthening, and I am looking forward to delivering the next phase of growth for Sonovate.”</p>

      <p>Having joined ASOS in 2011 as engineering change programme manager, Strudwick progressed to CTO and was responsible for the technology strategy that enabled ASOS to become one of the leading global ecommerce brands.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the new appointment, Sonovate co-CEO, Richard Prime, says: “To have someone with Bob’s experience come on board is a real game changer for us as we continue to deliver the flexible finance and world class tech that companies working with contingent workers are crying out for. Our customer base is expanding by the day and Bob will be fundamental to driving this growth both in the UK and internationally. His track record speaks for itself!”</p>
      <p>Launched to challenge traditional invoice finance products on offer from the banks, Sonovate reduces this complexity. It currently works with over 2,500 businesses, funding contingent workforce projects in across Europe and North America.</p>
      <p>The appointment follows Sonovate’s recent debt and equity funding round of £110 million.</p>
