      <p>Top management figures of the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have helped to clean a canteen inside the campus upon the request of a protester.</p>
      <p>Dozens of demonstrators have refused to leave the blockaded Hung Hom campus for more than a week following intense clashes with police. Most inside have either escaped or voluntarily left, though some have been arrested by officers stationed outside.</p>

      <p>Several top PolyU figures, including the Chairman of the Council Lam Tai-fai and Vice-Presidents Ben Young and Alexander Wai, paid a visit to inspect the university at midday on Thursday.</p>
      <p>As the group reached the Communal Building, they were stopped by a masked protester holding a soup spoon. The protester has become known as the “Chef” after volunteering to cook for protesters at the university’s main canteen.</p>

      <p>“Chef” insisted on speaking with the management and criticised them as arriving too late to help the people inside the campus.</p>
      <p>“Has anyone been helping me?” he asked. “Have you fulfilled your duties?”</p>

      <p>Wai said the canteen was dirty. “Chef” replied asking him to help clean it, which Wai agreed to.</p>
      <p>The management figures wore gloves as they helped “Chef” to clean the dining hall for around 30 minutes, however, Lam was not present.</p>

      <p>Wai said he had heard of protesters becoming sick from living in the squalid conditions and urged everyone to leave.</p>
      <p>When asked how he could persuade protesters facing rioting charges to leave, Wai said the university could arrange for management staff to accompany them to police stations or hospitals.</p>

      <p>Wai added he did not know when the university could reopen.</p>
      <p>“The campus is now being occupied and we have yet to gather the manpower to clean it,” he said.</p>

      <p>Way Kuo, the head of the City University, also paid a visit to the school on Thursday after hearing that two of his students were inside PolyU, though he did not find them.</p>
      <p>He said hygiene at the campus was deteriorating and urged all to leave. “It’s really sad,” he said.</p>

      <p>Catholic and Christian pastors also entered the school in an attempt to speak with those inside.</p>
      <p>Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said protesters inside PolyU did not trust the police and the government.</p>

      <p>“They are very concerned that they will get beaten up after they leave,” he said on a Commercial Radio programme on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ip said many of the protesters inside were “psychologically tortured” as the occupation dragged on.</p>
