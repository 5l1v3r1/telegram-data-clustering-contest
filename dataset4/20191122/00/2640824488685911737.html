      <p><b>designed over one generous floor plane, the plan is organized by the <a href="http://felipeescudero.com/">architect</a> according to the levels of privacy required of the spaces. </b>at one end is a huge living, dining and kitchen area that opens out to the site thanks to large floor-to-ceiling expanses of glazing. towards the opposite end, the concrete roof folds over to provide a greater degree of privacy for the service spaces and bedrooms.</p>

      <p><b>the project is volumetrically composed of an organic roof, which is covered with plants through a system of pots that are separate from the concrete slab so as not to generate moisture.</b> the entire building is surrounded by glass on its perimeter, maintaining a connection with the outside and visually highlighting the curved gesture of the roof.</p>

      <p><b>in the interior, the material palette is defined by a combination of concrete and timber to give warmth, and a cozy feeling despite the large spaces.</b> viewed from above, the house appears as a rectangle, a rational geometry that contrasts with the rest of the landscape, and the outdoor pool whose natural lines merge with the environment giving the impression of a lake and not an artificial pool. proving the project’s sustainable credentials, the water is also heated by solar panels located on the roof.</p>
