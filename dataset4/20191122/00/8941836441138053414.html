      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> is suing the Pentagon over a $10 billion cloud-computing contract awarded to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> said it filed a legal complaint Friday with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking to challenge the decision.</p>
      <p>The complaint is sealed, but the company said earlier this month there was “unmistakable bias” on the government’s part.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a>’s competitive bid for the “war cloud” project drew criticism from President Donald Trump, who said over the summer that he wanted the Pentagon to take a closer look.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon awarded the contract to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> in late October.</p>

      <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said the procurement was done fairly without outside influence.</p>

        <p>The contract, formally called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, was sought by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a>, Oracle and IBM.</p>
