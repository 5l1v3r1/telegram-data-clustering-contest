      <h1>Interest in UK tech jobs wanes as top talent flocks to Europe</h1>

      <p>Desire among jobseekers to find work in the UK tech sector has declined over the last two years while other European countries have benefited from a surge in interest, new data has revealed.</p>
      <p>Searches for jobs in Britain’s tech sector slipped three per cent between the first half of 2017 and the first half of 2019, according to figures from job site Indeed.</p>

      <p>In Belgium, searches for tech jobs soared 76 per cent over the same period, while Portugal and Sweden secured increases of 45 per cent and 42 per cent respectively.</p>
      <p>Of the 11 European countries covered in the research, only the UK registered a fall in job searches.</p>
      <p>Interest among American tech professionals in UK jobs has also declined in the last two years. Despite this, the UK remains the most popular EU country among US-based tech workers planning a move to Europe.</p>
      <p>The waning interest comes despite a string of upbeat reports showing overseas investors are ploughing record sums of money into the UK’s tech sector.</p>
      <p>Research released earlier this year by Innovate Finance and London &amp; Partners revealed that London has now overtaken New York to become the world’s number one city for investment in fintech firms.</p>
      <p>“Overall searches for UK tech jobs may have dipped but there is still much to shout about the sector,” said Bill Richards, UK managing director at Indeed.</p>
      <p>“Britain remains a hotbed for tech innovation, with global investment still pouring in and the country remains a world leader for creating tech unicorns and attracting a high-skilled global workforce.”</p>

      <p>Richards added that the slowdown in job searches likely reflected ongoing uncertainty about post-Brexit Britain.</p>
      <p>In addition, the research showed the growing interest in the UK tech sector among India-based jobseekers. More than a fifth of all UK job searches made by this demographic were for tech jobs.</p>
