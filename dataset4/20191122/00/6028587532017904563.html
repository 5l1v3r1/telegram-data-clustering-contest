      <p>The five titles that don’t quite break into the top 10, but which deserve to be mentioned for what they accomplish on the Billboard 200 this week are a healthy mix of collections that either make their way toward the top of the tally, or which have been living on the list for much, much longer than the average set. Genre doesn’t seem to play much of a factor in what studio efforts hold on for the most weeks, as is clear by the stats below.Here are five albums that made big moves on the Billboard 200 chart this week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 11 - Dave East - <i>Survival</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>After a series of successful mixtapes and one EP that was surprisingly popular two years ago, hip-hop musician Dave East has finally delivered his debut album. <i>Survival</i> misses becoming his second top 10 title by just one rung, as it starts its time on the Billboard 200 at No. 11. He previously peaked at No. 9 with the short project <i>Paranoia: A True Story</i>. </p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 67 - BTS - <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week, BTS’s <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i> was down at No. 136 on the Billboard 200, but this time around, its position improves considerably. The title rockets up the ranking and settles at No. 67, returning to the upper half of the list for the first time in months. Fans of the group are purchasing and streaming the set in large numbers after their favorite wasn’t presented a People’s Choice Award, losing in all three categories they were nominated in to fellow K-pop stars Blackpink.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 74 - Drake - <i>Take Care</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>As is typically the case these days, Drake occupies half a dozen spots on the Billboard 200, meaning six of his full-lengths were consumed enough this past frame to end up on the list of the most popular releases in America. As if that wasn’t enough of an accomplishment, one of his most successful albums reaches an important milestone this time around.</p>
      <p><i>Take Care</i> has now been present on the Billboard 200 for 350 weeks, a marker very few titles make it to.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 152 - Eagles - <i>Their Greatest Hits (1971 - 1975)</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>Already one of the bestselling titles in history, the Eagles’ first compilation of their most beloved singles, <i>Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)</i>, is still charting on the Billboard 200, and like Drake, the set makes it to a milestone that only a handful of releases have managed. The project, which has been certified more than three-times diamond (for shifting well over 30 million equivalent units in the U.S. alone), is back at No. 152 this frame, earning a three hundredth stay on the tally.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 156 - Various Artists - <i>Moana</i> soundtrack</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Moana</i> may not be in theaters any longer, but is still performing well on the Billboard 200 thanks in large part to continued streaming success. The songs featured on the soundtrack keep racking up plays by parents who use streaming services to let their young ones hear their favorites, and the album itself does still sell, even though the movie has long since left many people’s minds. </p>
      <p>This week, the <i>Moana</i> soundtrack celebrates three years (or exactly 156 weeks) on the Billboard 200.</p>
