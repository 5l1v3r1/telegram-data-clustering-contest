      <h1>Pep Guardiola Issues Ederson Injury Update as Chelsea Come to Town</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City are likely to have Ederson back between the sticks for Saturday evening's clash with Chelsea, with Pep Guardiola confirming the goalkeeper has trained as normal this week. </p>
      <p>City have been without the Brazilian stopper since he was withdrawn at half-time in their Champions League win over Atalanta at San Siro on 6 November.</p>
      <p>The hamstring injury that forced his premature departure from that one - which led to Claudio Bravo and then later Kyle Walker taking turns in goal after the former's red card - kept Ederson out of the 3-1 defeat to Liverpool prior to the international break. </p>

      <p>He didn't travel with Brazil for their clashes with Argentina and South Korea either, but Guardiola has confirmed his comeback should give them a much-needed boost against Chelsea - although long-term absentees Aymeric Laporte and Leroy Sané are still some way off their respective returns. </p>
      <p>"Ederson is back," Guardiola said, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7715041/Pep-Guardiola-confirms-Ederson-fit-start-against-Chelsea-hamstring-problem.html">​Mail</a>. "He trained the last two days without pain.</p>
      <p>"But Laporte and Sané are injured for two or three more months. It’s the same situation. The players who finished fit, the injuries are still out."</p>

      <p><a href="http://90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​City</a> take on <a href="http://90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a> looking to claw their way back up the table after slipping to fourth with defeat at Anfield, as both the Blues and <a href="http://90min.com/teams/leicester">​Leicester</a> notched wins that saw them leapfrog the defending champions. </p>
      <p>The Foxes sit in second at present, eight points behind <a href="http://90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> and ahead of Chelsea only on goal difference, while City sit a point behind both sides and nine off the pace in their bid to reclaim the title.</p>
      <p>A victory at the Etihad would go some way to restoring their damaged title prospects, and having Ederson back in the picture will greatly increase their chances of attaining that - even if their other absentees will remain out for the time being. </p>
