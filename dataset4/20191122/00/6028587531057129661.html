      <h1>Tesla Demo Fail: ‘Transparent Metal’ Armored Glass Smashed During Cybertruck Reveal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John Koetsier</a></address>
      <p>Have you ever heard a major public company CEO say OMFG on-stage?You have now.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-is-ugly-as-sin-there-i-said-it/">futuristic new Cybertruck</a> has armored glass windows that founder Elon Musk referred to as “transparent metal” during tonight’s reveal. Unfortunately, it’s not as tough as Musk thought it would be, and the vehicle’s glass was smashed after being hit with a large steel ball bearing during a demo.</p>
      <p>Which meant that Musk had to do the rest of the Cybertruck reveal with a damaged truck behind him.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go through. That’s the plus side,” said Musk after Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen smashed the windows.</p>
      <p>And after he collected himself from his original profane outburst.</p>

      <p>Tesla is not really a middle-America brand. Not the kind of America that drives pickup trucks, rolls coal, and head down to the creek with the boys to catch fish.</p>
      <p>So Tesla is emphasizing how tough the truck is.</p>
      <p>Musk initially suggested that they shoot the truck – probably jokingly – but fortunately cooler heads must have prevailed on that front.</p>
      <p>Then the Cybertruck successfully withstood several hits from a sledgehammer that dented an ordinary truck’s door. And in a glass-strength demo, a pane of the same glass that is in Cybertruck withstood multiple hits from large metal ball bearings dropped on it from up to 15 feet.</p>
      <p>“If you want a truck that’s really tough ... not fake tough,” Musk said, suggesting that people who want a serious truck will need to buy Tesla’s pickup truck.</p>
      <p>But hitting the actual window with the ball bearing didn’t go quite as Musk hoped.</p>
      <p>The front and rear driver’s side windows smashed on successive blows from a ball bearing, leaving the truck scarred for the rest of the evening.</p>
      <p>On the positive side, most vehicles would have been damaged by the sledgehammer blows, and most windows would have been completely shattered. Cybertruck’s windows were smashed, but maintained structural integrity.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Musk and Tesla made their point: Cybertruck is tough and capable.</p>
      <p>Even if they lost a few style points in the process.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s Cybertruck comes in three models ranging from a single motor rear-wheel drive $40,000 model to a triple-motor all-wheel drive $70,000 version ... plus an additional $7,000 for self-driving technology.</p>

      <p>Pre-orders are open now, and initial purchasers can reserve their truck for just a $100 deposit. They can start to expect to receive their vehicles “as production nears in late 2021.”</p>
