      <h3>Deontay Wilder has revealed he ditches traditional long runs for swimming in his lake and uses scuba diving as part of his rehabilitation.</h3>
      <p>Ahead of the heavyweight world champion’s next WBC title defence, <a href="https://www.mainevent.com.au/boxing/wilder-v-ortiz-2057">against Luis Ortiz on Sunday (AEDT)</a>, The Bronze Bomber revealed scuba diving is one of his recovery exercises.</p>
      <p>Wilder, who relies on water based training throughout camp, said: “For those that don’t know, I’m a certified scuba diver.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy it and I’ve been doing it for a few years now. It gives me relaxation and helps keep pressure off the muscles in my body.</p>

      <p>“It helps my body tremendously. It’s also strengthening my legs and expanding my lungs so that I have more stamina. Water is great for exercise and I love it.”</p>
      <p>The Alabama puncher is a late starter in the sport, only picking up the gloves three days before his 21st birthday as a means to make money for his daughter Naieya, who suffered with spina bifida at birth.</p>
      <p>Within three years Wilder won a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics Games - later becoming world champion in his 32nd fight after going the distance for the first time to outpoint Bermane Stiverne.</p>

      <p>But on the road to becoming WBC king, the American admitted he did not spend a minute on the road running.</p>
      <p>Before his fourth title defence - against Chris Arreola in July 2016 - Wilder revealed all his cardio training was done in the boxing gym.</p>
      <p>Or in his lake, behind the Tuscaloosa mansion he lives in, even using the back of his boats to do pull ups in.</p>
      <p>Wilder said: “I don’t run a day in my life.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say I run miles of roadwork, because I don’t. I don’t have to, I’m blessed to still have the stamina, and not get tired.</p>

      <p>“I’ve got a nice mansion outside and there’s a big lake, there’s water. So that’s where I get all my work from - water.</p>
      <p>“It can be wonders what water can do to your whole body. Sometimes I do a workout from my boat, I got two boats.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes I get on the back of it and do pull ups from the back of it as the resistance from the water comes to get me. It’s a hell of a workout.</p>
