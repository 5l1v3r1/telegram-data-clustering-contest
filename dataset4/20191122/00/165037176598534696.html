      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo's tweet after being left out of Juve's call-up</h1>

        <b>Juventus and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo was left off his team's squad for the 13th round of Serie A in Italy in the final match before Atletico Madrid crossed paths in the Champions League.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As coach <b>Maurizio Sarri</b> suggested at the press conference prior to the Bergamo duel, in which he declared that it was almost 99% sure Cristiano Ronaldo would not be available, the Portuguese striker will rest this weekend to <b>arrive ready for next Tuesday's European match in Turin.</b></p>
      <p>The Portuguese striker wanted to reassure his fans and posted a message on Twitter: "Focused on my recovery to come back soon," he said.</p>
      <p>Cristiano, who scored <b>six goals between all competitions this year </b>(five in Serie A and one in Champions League), has been having some knee issues, despite being a starter and <b>scoring four goals</b> with his team against Lithuania and Luxembourg, still not at the top of his form.</p>
      <p>Before the break, the former Madrid player was <b>replaced twice in a row</b>, in the final stages of the matches won against <b>Lokomotiv Moscow</b> in the Champions League (2-1) and against <b>Milan in Serie A (1-0).</b></p>

      <p>Sarri wants his <b>attacking leader to recover his best version</b> and decided to give him a day off this weekend, despite Juventus visiting<b> one of the most complicated fields in Serie A,</b> the newly opened Gewiss Stadium at Atalanta.</p>
      <p>Without the Portuguese, Argentinians Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain are expected to make up for his absence , as Sarri is still without Croatian <b>Mario Mandzukic, </b>once again out of the squad and one step away from leaving the club in the winter market.</p>
