      <p>The issue of the real identity of ace investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw has once again been brought to the fore following the circulation of a video purported to feature him.</p>
      <p>The video in circulation shows a well-built man with braided hair being confronted by another for attempting to claim the latter’s entitled land.</p>
      <p>The visibly upset looking man is heard shouting the journalist’s name questioning his authenticity.</p>
      <p>“He said he’s Anas Aremeyaw. He’s coming to claim. Today I’ve got Anas. Somebody has title, you’re coming to claim that you’re Anas Aremeyaw Anas,” he’s heard yelling.</p>
      <p>This new development raises questions about the actual identity of the investigative journalist as there are one too many characters who have been publicized as his.</p>
      <p>In May last year, MP for Assin Central, Kennedy Agyapong released photos which he claimed were images of Anas Aremeyaw Anas.</p>
      <p>He was backing up his words after he threatened to unmask Anas on live television.</p>
      <p>He lamented that the investigative journalist had brought more harm than good to innocent civilians through his operations.</p>
      <p>“I’ll strip this boy naked because the things he has done to Ghanaians, I was expecting that he was an angel but what he does to live, God should have struck him dead with thunder. I have a dossier on Anas so Kweku Baako shouldn’t dare me at all”, Mr Agyapong said.</p>
      <p>The legislator also released a documentary he titled “Who watches the Watchman” following an investigative expose Anas premiered to expose corrupt activities in the Ghana Football Association.</p>

      <p>The documentary led to the dismissal of the GFA president, Kwesi Nyantakyi together with his cohorts.</p>
      <p>Below are some pictures which have been shared as the identity of Anas Aremeyaw Anas.</p>
