      <p>The Nifty is expected to open flat in morning trade on November 22 amid persistent worries over the status of trade negotiations between the US and China.</p>
      <p>Worries that a 'phase one' trade deal between the US and China might not occur until next year weighed on Wall Street, pulling the S&amp;P 500 down 0.16 percent to 3,103.54. The Dow Jones ended 0.2 percent lower at 27,766.29 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.24 percent lower at 8,506.21.</p>
      <p>Trends on SGX Nifty indicate a flat opening for the broader index in India with a three points loss. Nifty futures were trading around 11,974 on the Singaporean Exchange.</p>
      <p>On November 21, the Sensex fell 76.47 points to 40,575.17 and Nifty ended 30.70 points lower at 11,968.40.</p>
      <p>The rupee pared initial losses and settled five paise up at 71.76 against the US currency on November 21 amid softening crude oil prices and weakening of the greenback vis-a-vis other currencies overseas.</p>
      <p>On the institutional front, FPIs were net buyers in Indian markets for Rs 5,023.54 crore while the DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 247.74 crore, provisional data showed.</p>
