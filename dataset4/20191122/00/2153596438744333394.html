      <p>A strike at South African Airways, which has dragged on since 15 November and grounded a number of flights, is likely to end today, with workers having agreed “in principle” to a pay deal, a senior union official said.</p>
      <p>The deal will see workers get a 5.9% pay increase, with a further increment – details of which are still being worked out – being paid at a later date, Christopher Shabangu, deputy president of the South African Cabin Crew Association, said by phone on Friday.</p>
      <p>The association and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which represent more than 3,000 SAA workers, plan to hold a media briefing later on Friday, where they will reveal more details of the terms of the pay offer.</p>
      <p>SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone.</p>
