      <p>Talking to reporters, Raut reiterated that his party will get the Maharashtra CM's post when the three-party alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party assumes power.</p>
      <p>"The time for offers has ended," Raut said, when asked about reports that the BJP had agreed to share the CM's post with the Sena.</p>
      <p>"People of Maharashtra want Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to become the CM," he said.</p>
      <p>Asked if the three non-BJP parties would meet the state governor on Friday itself, Raut quipped, "Why meet the governor when the President's rule is in place".</p>
