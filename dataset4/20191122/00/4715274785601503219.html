      <p>State regulator Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved last week the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project proposed by the joint venture of tycoon Enrique Razon and businessman Oscar Violago. The approval of the Wawa project will significantly reduce the heavy dependence of the country's two concessionaires on Angat Dam, the sole source whose water level has often breached the critical level due to drought conditions. Both Manila Water Co. Inc. and Maynilad Water Services Inc. started to ration water again on Oct. 24, 2019 as Angat Dam continued to be below the ideal level.   The approval of the MWSS may have been late but the emergence of the Wawa project as an alternative water source ensures ample supply, especially during the dry months. MWSS chairman Reynaldo Velasco conceded that Wawa Dam was an integral part of the overall short-, medium- and long-term water flagship projects of MWSS to ensure water security. “We are in a catch-up mode as far as water supply source is concerned,” says Velasco. “Wawa Dam, which used to be the water source for Metro Manila before Angat Dam was completed on 1967 and became operational, has been identified by water experts as the best potential water supply source for Metro Manila.” The proponent of the Wawa water project in Rodriguez (formerly Montalban municipality) has committed to supply 80 million liters per day in 2021 and more than 500 MLD in 2025 to address the current water crisis in Metro Manila. The MWSS, meanwhile, should be pro-active in identifying and developing new water sources to augment the supply of Angat Dam and the Wawa project. It should heed the earlier call of the House of Representatives to formulate a national water security plan to ensure the uninterrupted supply of the vital commodity to households and other users. It should be a shame if the MWSS and other related government agencies fail to draw up the plan, considering the country's vast supply of water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, groundwater and rainfall.</p>
