      <p>What a stupid way to basically end your life as well as somebody else’s over a football game.</p>
      <p>A fight between two fans over the outcome of the Nov. 9th LSU-Alabama game turned fatal when one man shot the other with a pistol.</p>
      <p>James Michael Roland “Mikie” Merritt tragically lost his life on Friday after almost a week spent on life support. He was just 29-years-old.</p>
      <p>The alleged shooter is David Allen Fulkerson, and he has now been charged with murder, according to the <a href="https://www.timesdaily.com/news/charges-upgraded-after-shooting-victim-dies-overnight/article_060596e6-d6fb-577c-a227-5085f2e59687.html">TimesDaily newspaper in Florence.</a></p>
      <p>County Sheriff Frank Williamson <i>“said the shooting happened at Fulkerson’s residence at 2172 Ligon Springs Road after an argument concerning the outcome of the game.”</i></p>
      <blockquote>“They just got into it over the ball game,” the sheriff said. “They’d been jawing at each other all day. Alcohol played a big part in it.”<br/><br/>Williamson said several people had gathered at the residence to watch the game. He said Merritt and Fulkerson’s girlfriends are sisters.”</blockquote>
      <p>At one point during the game, Merritt called a football player an expletive, and Fulkerson thought it was direct to him so he went and grabbed his gun.</p>
      <p>Fulkerson’s defense attorney claimed self defense because of the black eye he suffered. That was dispelled when a witness told authorities that she watched Fulkerson hit himself in the face.</p>
      <p>LSU defeated the Crimson Tide 46-41.</p>
