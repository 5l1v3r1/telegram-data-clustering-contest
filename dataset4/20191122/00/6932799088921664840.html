        <b>OnePlus has released its Open Beta 6 software update for the 7 and 7 Pro. This version of OxygenOS confers the latest security patch levels on the 2 phones. It also introduces a setting to disable Zen Mode, as well as some fixes for the series' in-display fingerprint scanner.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-OnePlus-7T-trade-in-program-is-a-joke.443710.0.html">OnePlus</a> has announced a new <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-open-beta-6-for-the-oneplus-7-and-oneplus-7-pro.1143215/">official public beta</a> build of its <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-announces-new-stable-and-beta-updates-for-the-7T-and-7-7-Pro-respectively.441928.0.html">OxygenOS</a> Android skin for 2 of its newest phones, the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-7-Smartphone-Phone-with-dual-camera-setup-in-review.423768.0.html">7</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-7-Pro-Smartphone-Review.420598.0.html">7 Pro</a>. It contains previews of fresh and updated features, including the latest Android security patch. This software channel, which is known as <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-releases-its-first-version-of-Android-10-for-the-7-and-7-Pro.434388.0.html">Open Beta</a> as opposed to the conventional <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-releases-its-first-stable-version-of-Android-10-for-the-7-and-7-Pro.438943.0.html">stable</a> counterpart, also tests a new option in which the OEM's "<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-releases-a-beta-update-to-Android-10-for-the-Mi-9-SE.439838.0.html">screen-detox</a>" app <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-OnePlus-6-and-6T-will-get-Zen-Mode-but-not-NightScape-2-0.420771.0.html">Zen Mode</a> can be disabled.</p>
      <p>This new <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-open-beta-6-for-the-oneplus-7-and-oneplus-7-pro.1143215/">Open Beta 6</a> update also fixes an issue by which the fingerprint scanner, which is set into the display, was not signified well enough in the UI. This <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-OnePlus-7-Pro-s-screen-is-the-notchless-panel-that-was-promised.420607.0.html">display</a> effect also has animations that indicate its activation, which are also apparently improved in this beta. It also contains general system and stability housekeeping.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-open-beta-6-for-the-oneplus-7-and-oneplus-7-pro.1143215/">latest Open Beta</a> for the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-releases-a-camera-centric-software-update-for-the-7-Pro.423611.0.html">7 series</a> is slightly but significantly advanced compared to the stable version (<a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-10-0-2-for-the-oneplus-7-pro-and-oneplus-7.1142262/">OxygenOS 10.0.2</a>, which is still on the October 2019 security patches). This doesn't make the general-consumption channel any less functional, of course.</p>
      <p>However, those interested in switching from one to the other would be advised to follow the <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-open-beta-6-for-the-oneplus-7-and-oneplus-7-pro.1143215/">instructions</a> on OnePlus' community website carefully while doing so: for example, 7 or 7 Pro owners still on Android Pie- (9.0) based software need to download and install Open Beta 5 before proceeding to its immediate update.</p>
