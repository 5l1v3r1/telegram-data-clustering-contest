      <h1>State of Decay 2 on Steam will have cross-play co-op</h1>
      <h2>Steam version launching in 'early 2020'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Devore</a></address>
      <p>It's exciting to see the name "Xbox Game Studios" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3090835">pop up on Steam</a> in any form, from <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection </i>to <i>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition </i>to <i>Gears 5</i>. I hope it keeps up.</p>
      <p>Today, we've got another Xbox One and Windows 10 PC game for that also-available-on-Steam list: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-state-of-decay-2-503097.phtml"><i>State of Decay 2</i></a>. Undead Labs' co-op zombie survival game is shambling over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_Of_Decay_2/">Steam</a> in "early 2020."</p>
      <p>The best bit? There's cross-play support for co-op.</p>
      <p>With an Xbox Live account, <i>State of Decay 2 </i>players can partner with three other survivors across Steam, Windows 10, and Xbox One. That's something I'd like to see even more of as we enter next-gen. Letting us play games with our friends, hassle-free, no matter where they are? That's the dream.</p>
