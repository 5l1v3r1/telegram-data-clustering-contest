        <b>While much of his battle with Class A drug addiction is expected to be covered in a soon-to-be-published memoir, Sir Elton has also shared a couple of frank details ahead of the release, including his stint as a cocaine addict.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Chris Evans’ Virgin Radio Breakfast Show, Elton John has recalled an episode from his heyday when The Beatles’ George Harrison told him to “stop putting marching powder up his nose".</p>
      <blockquote>Sir Elton recounted the musician’s golden tips as the host pressed him, asking what George Harrison’s “best advice” for him was.</blockquote>
      <p>Joining the chuckling Elton John, Evans went still further wondering how long “it has been now".</p>
      <p>“Twenty-nine years", the pop legend responded, cheekily remarking that “the nose is still here".</p>
      <p>He also recounted The Beatles legend advising him to “play live” whatever it takes as “when you’re young, they’ll drop you like a five-pound note on the floor".</p>
      <p>It is not the first time that Elton John has been candid about his substance abuse and other sensitive issues, as he dedicated a sizeable part of his recent memoir to the Class A drug addiction he battled.</p>
      <p>For instance, speaking about an incident in mid-1983 when he was filming his I’m Still Standing music video, the music star recalled his agent telling him he’d literally ruined his entire hotel suite. Only he didn’t remember a thing about how he had inflicted the damage.</p>
      <blockquote>In one of the chapters of “Me: Elton John", the 72-year-old writes about taking the Class A drug, saying it left him like a “monster".</blockquote>
      <p>“Because I was doing coke, I wasn’t a rational human being any more. You become unreasonable and irresponsible, self-obsessed, a law unto yourself", he notes.</p>
