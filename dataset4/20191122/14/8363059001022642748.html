      <p>Dog scientists – no wait, human scientists specialising in dog issues, to make that clear – have decided we've been calculating the ages of our favourite pets all wrong. They're older than you'd think, and they get older differently to humans.</p>
      <p>Basically the vast majority of dogs are middle aged, as middle aged for a dog starts way earlier than it does in people. The animals age quicker at first in comparison to us to begin with, it seems, hitting middle after just two years, when a two-year-old animal is actually the human equivalent of 42. The old seven-to-one system would have them still in their teens.</p>
      <p>Then, once this initial fast ageing spurt is over, dogs begin to age slower. So over the next five or six years of their lives they only put on the rough equivalent of 20 more human-like years. So the poor things are middle aged for about three-quarters of their whole lives. Which explains why they like sitting by the fire eating sausages and barking at strangers.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate end result of this new thinking about dogs is that there's now a complicated formula used to calculated an animal's age, which goes: human_age = 16 ln(dog_age) + 31. That's basically meaningless, so the New Scientist has created <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224268-convert-your-dogs-age-into-human-years-using-this-new-formula/">a dog-to-human age calculator</a>, that does the hard work. [<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224268-convert-your-dogs-age-into-human-years-using-this-new-formula/">New Scientist</a>]</p>
