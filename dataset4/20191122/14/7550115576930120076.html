        <b>Liverpool manager <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> insists this season was never designated as the one in which they would end their long wait to win the championship and that title talk is for everyone else.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Reds return to action after the international break with an eight-point lead over Leicester and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/tottenham">Tottenham</a> as they head to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>Their win over <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Manchester City</a> – now nine points adrift – last time out was widely seen as pivotal shift in their chances of securing a first title since 1990 but Klopp said no-one is talking about that inside the club.</p>
      <p>“We don’t think about the title race. The biggest challenge for us is constantly facing questions about it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“After that it is completely normal season. We never made it the season where we have to (win the league).</p>
      <p>“We play as good as we can, try to get as many points as we can and the challenges are the 26 games we have to play – and the next one is <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>“These challenges are big enough so we don’t need any others and we don’t think about anything else.”</p>

      <p>Influential centre-back <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil Van Dijk</a> is available for the trip to Selhurst Park after missing Holland’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia for personal reasons but doubts still persist of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a>.</p>
      <p>Both are struggling with ankle injuries – Salah since sustaining the problem against Leicester in October – and Klopp will have to make a late decision on the pair.</p>
      <p>“In the moment, yes, Virgil is 100 per cent available. It’s the time of the year where people drop out of the squad overnight with other things like illness,” added Klopp.</p>
      <p>“For the others, I cannot say 100 per cent. Today is a very important session to judge that especially with the players who came back late.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>, Bobby (<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>) and Ali (<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a> Becker) played on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> played on Tuesday, we have these players where we need to have a look how they react and what makes sense for them or not.</p>
      <p>“(Salah) has trained the whole time has has been here (during the international break) but only the things we have wanted him to do.</p>
      <p>“It’s not that it has got worse but it’s still kind of there, that’s the problem.</p>
      <p>“We have to be sensible with things like this. We have to make a decision.”</p>

      <p>Klopp is at least boosted by the return to fitness of forward <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/xherdan-shaqiri/">Xherdan Shaqiri</a>, who has not played since mid-September because of a calf injury.</p>
      <p>He has made just four substitute appearances and has some ground to make up to get to the level of the rest of the squad.</p>
      <p>“He trained this week and we gave him some different things to do. There is no reason to rush it but it’s nice to have him back,” added Klopp.</p>
      <p>“We saw a lot of really nice things in training this week but it is intense for him and he needs to get used to the intensity again and everything will be fine.”</p>
      <p>There had been speculation Shaqiri was looking for a way out because of limited playing opportunities – he has featured just eight times since the end of February and made just one start since January – but Klopp insisted he still had a part to play.</p>
      <p>“Why should I talk about something which is absolutely not interesting for us,” said the manager.</p>
      <p>“He was five weeks injured and that is a period when he is not seen as a player. Before that we spoke about him not having as many games as he wanted to but that was pretty much all.</p>
      <p>“When I am with him he is completely happy and fine here and speculation is speculation, it is nothing we can change. Of course he has a future. This season he is a very important player for us.”</p>
