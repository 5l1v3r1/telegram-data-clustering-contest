      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:03:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The University of Calcutta has included the Third Gender option in its admission forms from the next academic session, Vice-Chancellor Sonali Chakraborty Banerjee said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Along with male and female, the admission forms for post-graduate and under-graduate courses in the university will now have the option of Third Gender, Banerjee told PTI.</p>
      <p>The decision to include the option was taken after a notice by the University Grants Commission (UGC) called for the inclusion of Transgender as Third Gender in various scholarships and fellowships, she said.</p>
      <p>“As per the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, Transgender will be included as a third gender under the various scholarships/fellowship schemes of UGC,” the notice said.</p>
      <p>Responding to the demand of the present time, the university felt that there should not be any discrimination in higher education facilities on the basis of someone’s sex, Chakraborty said.</p>
      <p>Till now, candidates had to tick in a box to denote the applicant’s sex – male or female – while filling up the admission form of the university.</p>
