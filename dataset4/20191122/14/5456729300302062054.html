      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:18:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/364628-pdp-bot-sets-up-committee-over-members-concerns-in-edo-kano-lagos-others.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Board of Trustee (BoT) of <a href="https://peoplesdemocraticparty.com.ng/">Peoples Democratic Party</a> (PDP), has set up a committee to look into concerns of its members in Edo, Lagos, Kano and other states.</p>
      <p>PDP BoT Chairman, Walid Jibrin, disclosed this while speaking with journalists on Friday in Abuja on the outcome of the board’s Thursday meeting.</p>
      <p>Mr Jibrin said that the BoT also formed various committees to assist in running activities of the board.</p>
      <p>“We have instructed various committees to go into action especially the committee on Peace and Conflict, we noted that there were some many complains in Edo, Kano, Lagos, and so on.</p>
      <p>“After the committee goes into action in finding out the true situation, we will now recommend and look at the matter solemnly before 2020,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Jubrin said that the BoT also recommended to the National Working Committee (NWC) to set up a committee to investigate what happened during Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi and Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“We viewed the accusations and counter-accusations among our members on the behaviour of some of our members in Kogi and Bayelsa, especially those in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“We advised that we will not run the gun. We have to make a thorough research before we come to conclusion of who did what and suggest remedies.</p>
      <p>“Therefore we recommended to the NWC that a very serious investigation must take place,’’ he said.</p>

      <p>The chairman expressed concern about violence and alleged irregularities that characterised the governorship elections.</p>
      <p>“We advised the party on this especially the death of Kogi PDP chair-lady,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Jubrin said the board would ensure that the party becomes stronger and stronger, while calling on all PDP supporters and members to remain resolute in the face of challenges.</p>
      <p>“We are also suggesting that NWC should carry on with its activities. We have also asked the organs of the party that all of us must come together.</p>
      <p>“When everything is concluded, the meeting of the National Caucus and the BoT, National Executive Council and National Convention will now come to review all that we have done.</p>
      <p>“Thereafter, NWC will then prepare a special report recommending a special action of various bodies or the party,’’ he said. (NAN)</p>
