      <p>Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo on Friday swore-in Justice Esther Edigin as the seventh Chief Judge of the state, following the retirement of Justice Esohe Ikponmwen.</p>
      <p>At the ceremony held at Government House in Benin, Obaseki urged judicial officers in the state to maintain worthy records.</p>
      <p>“I commend judicial officers in the state on how they have remained unsoiled despite operating at a time where the judiciary is having several integrity concern.</p>
      <p>“Edo has not recorded any incident of suspension or dismissal of a judge by the Nigerian Judicial Council on account of corruption.</p>
      <p>“This is a worthy record and one which I implore all judicial officers to maintain,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that the new chief judge faithfully served as judge in the state, urging her to ensure speedy dispensation of justice.</p>
      <p>The governor also urged Edigin to strengthen the state magistracy.</p>
      <p>In her remarks, the new chief judge said that her intention was to prioritise staff welfare especially that of the magistracy.</p>
      <p>She promised that her administration would have zero tolerance for corruption.</p>
      <p>Edigin promised to work with other judges in the state and other arms of  government to ensure effective dispensation of justice.</p>
      <p>She, however, appealed to the executive arm to complete the process of financial independence for the judiciary in accordance with Section 121 sub-Section 3 of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Edigin was born on May 17, 1956.</p>
      <p>She was called to bar on July 17, 1979.</p>
      <p>In 1989, Edigin joined the then Bendel State Judiciary as Chief Magistrate Grade 11 and was appointed a high court judge in 2001. </p>
