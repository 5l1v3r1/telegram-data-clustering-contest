      <p>An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/antonio-brown">Antonio Brown</a> reunion with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> doesn’t appear to be happening.</p>
      <p>Rumors swirled Thursday when a <a href="https://weei.radio.com/blogs/weei/christian-fauria-pats-have-kicked-tires-on-antonio-brown">WEEI report</a> revealed the Patriots were “kicking tires” on potentially re-signing Brown. But <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffphowe/status/1197715738687086592">The Athletic</a> put the rumor to bed Friday with a source telling the website the controversial wide receiver wouldn't get a second chance with New England.</p>

      <p>Brown issued an apology to the Patriots organization and team owner Robert Kraft on social media earlier this week for causing a distraction to the team.</p>
      <p>“Mr.Kraft I apologize sincerely to you and your organization! All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama ! Thank you sincerely AB,” he captioned on Instagram and Twitter.</p>

      <p>The post received likes from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> and other players.</p>
      <p>When it comes to Brown rejoining the Patriots, Brady said in a radio interview on <a href="https://westwoodonesports.com/2019/11/tom-brady-on-the-cowboys-antonio-brown-and-more/">Westwood One</a> on Thursday it wasn’t up to him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think those decisions honestly are up to me,” he said. “They are not up to me when we cut players or sign players. I think the people in the personnel department decide those things. My job is to play quarterback and that is what I am trying to do as well as I possibly can.”</p>
      <p>Brady explained to the media why he “liked” the photo on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t put much thought into it. But it’s his choice, and good for him.”</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, Brown filed a countersuit against the former female trainer who alleged in a civil case that he had sexually assaulted and raped her on three different occasions, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28125765/antonio-brown-countersuing-britney-taylor-defamation">ESPN</a>.
