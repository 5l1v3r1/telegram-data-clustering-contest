      <h2>Murdered 21-year-old Grace Millane who died at the hands of a New Zealand man is among young Brits robbed of their lives by violence on what should have been their dream trips abroad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:12:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>At age 21 'talented and beautiful' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/grace-millane">Grace Millane</a> followed the footsteps of countless adventurous young Brits before her and set out to see the world.</p>
      <p>The young woman could scarcely have been farther from her home and family in Wickford, Essex, as she travelled to the opposite side of the globe to fulfil her dream of exploring <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> .</p>
      <p>What should have been a dream trip for the young woman was cut brutally short by the actions of a 27-year-old man, who choked her to death in his Auckland hotel apartment, then stuffed her body in a suitcase and dumped it on a mountainous range.</p>
      <p>Grace's devastated parents were forced to travel across the world to listen to the graphic details recounting their daughter's private life and her final movements for three weeks at the high profile murder trial.</p>
      <p>A jury delivered a guilty verdict today, but the family's ordeal is far from over as the Millanes grieve for Grace, while her 27-year-old killer is yet to be named publicly and sentenced.</p>

      <p>Speaking outside court on Friday, David Millane delivered a heartbreaking speech alongside his wife, Gillian as they paid tribute to Grace before they return home without their 'talented, beautiful' daughter.</p>
      <p>Scores of young globe-trotting Brits tour the world and make the trek back to the UK again safely, bringing home memories and lasting connections with new friends forged abroad, every single year.</p>
      <p>But the Millanes' pain is shared by other British families who have lost their loved ones overseas - with some still struggling to find justice many years on.</p>
      <h3>Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters</h3>
      <p>British travellers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters were brutally murdered by notorious backpacker serial killer Ivan Milat, who terrorised backpackers hitchhiking in Australia.</p>
      <p>The bodies of Caroline and travel companion Joanne were among seven bodies discovered in shallow graves in the Belanglo State Forest, southwest of Sydney, during 1992 and 1993.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Caroline, 21, a former Pizza Hut assistant manager, had gone to Australia in 1991 on a dream working holiday, after spending months saving up to pay for her trip.</p>
      <p>She and Joanne, 22, a nanny, from Mid Glamorgan, were hitching south from Sydney down the Hume Highway when they accepted a lift from Milat.</p>
      <p>They were subsequently reported missing and Carolineâ€™s parents flew out to Australia in August, 1992, to help in the search.</p>
      <p>Tragically, the following month, the bodies of both backpackers were found in shallow graves.</p>
      <p>Caroline had been stabbed and shot 10 times in the head.</p>

      <p>Milat is also suspected of being involved in at least three other missing persons cases, <br/><br/>Caroline's dad, Ian Clarke, told Australian media shortly before Milat's death last month he had hoped he would confess to the other murders to help other families who had no answers.</p>
      <p>"It was in its way a form of closure, that we'd found her and we were able to lay her to rest properly. It's these other parents who don't have the luxury of being able to do that."</p>
      <h3>Scarlett Keeling</h3>
      <p>The mother of the British teen raped and killed in India was forced to fight to get justice for her girl after she was murdered on their mother-and-daughter backpacker trip.</p>
      <p>Scarlett Keeling's bruised and half-naked body was found on the shores of Anjuna beach in Goa in February 2008.</p>
      <p>Police at first tried to claim the 15-year-old schoolgirl had drowned.</p>
      <p>However her mum, Fiona MacKeown, visited the scene of her death and snuck into morgue and began her quest to prove that her daughter died in a violent murder.</p>

      <p>Scarlett had been raped and deliberately drowned after being plied with drugs.</p>
      <p>Two local men were charged with rape and murder but were acquitted in 2016.</p>
      <p>Ms MacKeown pressed for an appeal and the case was sent to a higher court, resulting in Samson D'Souza finally facing justice for Scarlett's murder this July.</p>
      <h3>Hannah Witheridge and David Miller</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/thailand-beach-murders-hannah-witheridge-4297566">Hannah</a> , 23, from Norfolk and pal David Miller, 24, from Jersey were bludgeoned to death on a beach in Koh Tao, southern Thailand, in 2014.</p>
      <p>Hannah was also raped before her half-naked body was dumped on the beach.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The pair's grieving families have faced a frustrating struggle to find justice for their loved ones.</p>
      <p>It emerged in recent months the two Burmese migrants convicted of their deaths would be executed after their appeals were thrown out by the court.</p>
      <p>Their convictions have sparked human rights abuses concerns as Thai authorities faced accusations the men, who belong to a minority ethnicity, may have been framed as scapegoats for the crime.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The pair originally confessed to the crimes, but later claimed police tortured them.</p>
      <p>Hannah's sister Laura, who recently also died after battling an illness, had <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/family-hannah-witheridge-say-lives-20082748">spoken of doubts</a> that the migrants had killed her sister.</p>
      <h3>Mia Ayliffe-Chung and Tom Jackson</h3>
      <p>Brit backpackers Mia Ayliffe-Chung and Tom Jackson stabbed to death in a hostel in Australia in 2016.</p>
      <p>A Frenchman accused of the pair's murder had criminal charges dropped.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mia, 21, died along with with Tom, 30, when Smail Ayad dragged her from her hostel bed in Queensland and stabbed her to death.</p>
      <p>Mia had been travelling the world since September 2015 but in Australia she attempted to extend her tourist visa by working as a manual farm labourer.</p>
      <p>But after a week at the hostel, Ayad, who shared a four-bed mixed sex dorm with Mia, killed her in a stabbing frenzy after developing an obsessive crush.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Hero Tom was critically injured as he tried to save Mia, and later died in hospital.</p>
      <p>A judge at the Brisbane Mental Health Court last year decided Ayad <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mental-health">was of unsound mind</a> when he killed the tourists and must be taken to a mental health facility.</p>
      <h3>Amelia Blake</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/weve-lost-beautiful-girl-family-11875382">British backpacker Amelia, 22,</a> was killed in a suspected murder suicide by her boyfriend in Australia.</p>
      <p>The young woman sustained "appalling" injuries before being discovered by her landlord in Sydney in early 2018.</p>
      <p>Police believe Ms Blake was killed by her 33-year-old Nepalese boyfriend Brazil Gurung.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>His dead body was found alongside Amelia's.</p>
      <p>Her family were heartbroken at the loss of their "beautiful girl" Amelia, from Loughborough, who had an adventurous spirit and was reportedly planning to travel on to Vietnam.</p>
      <p>She had met Gurung when the pair were both employed at a Brazilian restaurant in the major city.</p>
      <p>Their bodies were discovered in a cramped two-bedroom flat above a restaurant in the trendy suburb of Newtown at 5:30pm.</p>
      <p>Local police are still investigating. The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5396106/amelia-blake-killed-cocaine-boyfriend-brazil-gurung-leave-australia/">Sun</a> reported claims Gurung, a chef, was broke and using drugs, and is suspected to have killed Amelia because he didn't want her to leave Australia.</p>
