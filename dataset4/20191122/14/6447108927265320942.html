      <p>Rocket League’s Blueprint Update which is scheduled for release on December 4th will remove in-game Crates, the Rocket League version of loot boxes, and replace them with Blueprints. It will also see the launch of the Item Shop and the removal of the Show room, and the launch of Competitive Season 13.</p>
      <p>Here are further details from Psyonix.</p>
      <blockquote>BLUEPRINTS, INVENTORY CHANGES, AND ARCHIVING<br/>Following the Blueprint Update, Blueprints will start to drop after select Online Matches. These new drops will show you a specific item that can then be built for Credits. You can build the item, trade it to a friend, or just keep it in your inventory.<br/><br/>Any unopened Crates you have in your inventory will be converted to unrevealed Blueprints of the same series, which you can reveal at no cost. You can find your revealed and unrevealed Blueprints in the new Blueprints tab in your inventory.<br/><br/>Keys that you own will automatically convert to our new in-game currency called Credits. Credits can be used to build Blueprints, buy items from the Item Shop, or upgrade to Rocket Pass Premium. One Key will convert to 100 Credits.<br/><br/>Since this is a major conversion of items, Crates will stop dropping and all purchases in <i>Rocket League</i> will be disabled for 25 hours leading up to the update beginning at 9 a.m. PST (5 p.m. UTC) on December 3. This includes the purchase of Keys and DLC Packs, player-to-player trades, trade-ins, and the ability to interact with any Crates you own. All <i>Rocket League</i> online playlists will still be up and running.<br/><br/>Trade-ins (trading five items for one item of a higher rarity) for items received from Crates will no longer be possible following the update. That means this is your last chance to trade in any duplicate Crate items before December 3. Free post-game drops will still be available for trade-in after the update.<br/><br/>With all new items hitting your inventories, you’ll have a new place to put things you don’t want to see. The update will bring the ability to archive your items. Archived items will be kept in the new Archive tab in your inventory.<br/><br/>ITEM SHOP GRAND OPENING<br/>The <b>Item Shop</b> is nearly open for business! Once the update goes live, you’ll be able to check out this new storefront and browse in-game items that will rotate on a daily basis. Soon, you’ll be able to see the exact price of an item and if it’s Painted, Certified, or both! For more information on the Item Shop, check out our <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/the-item-shop--a-closer-look/"><b>in-depth look</b></a>.<br/><br/>The arrival of the Item Shop means the Showroom is leaving. This includes all current Premium DLC Packs. These items will no longer be available for purchase as packs. Items from Premium DLC Packs may return for individual sale in the Item Shop at a later date.<br/><br/>ROCKET PASS 5 INCOMING!<br/>The Blueprint Update will start to draw the scene for <b>Rocket Pass 5</b>, which will begin the same day as the update. Stay tuned for Rocket Pass 5’s full reveal next week.<br/><br/>COMPETITIVE SEASON 13 BEGINS<br/>Competitive Season 13 begins on the day of the update, which means Competitive Season 12 is coming to a close at 8 a.m. PST (2 p.m. UTC) on December 4.<br/><br/>The arrival of Season 13 means it’s time to distribute Season 12 Rewards, which will be granted shortly after the update. You still have time to earn your Season 12 Decals. Just make sure you complete your placement matches in a Competitive Playlist and fulfill the appropriate Season Reward Level by December 4. Good luck out there!<br/><br/>We hope you’re excited for our last big update of 2019. Make sure to finish the year strong and get ready for 2020!</blockquote>
