      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7714833/Real-Madrid-contemplating-contract-extension-Karim-Benzema.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a> claims that Real Madrid “are considering” preparing a new contract for Benzema, due to his impressive form in the ongoing 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has scored nine times in 11 La Liga appearances so far this season, and is also the manager Zinedine Zidane’s first-choice centre-forward ahead of Luka Jovic, who Real Madrid signed during this summer.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, his current deal runs up only until the summer of 2021, and according to <i>Marca </i>as reported by <i>Daily Mail</i>, the club are keen to extend that to 2023.</p>
      <p>The English news agency further adds that the 31-year-old has already entered into talks with Real Madrid – however – an agreement is still a long way off.</p>
      <p>Should Benzema and <i>Los Blancos</i> fail to reach an agreement with each other, the club will plan to offload him during the upcoming summer transfer window – and that would not be a big problem for the as there would be no shortage of suitors for the player.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Daily Mail</i>, Paris Saint Germain (PSG) and several Premier League clubs are thought to be interested in him at the moment.</p>
