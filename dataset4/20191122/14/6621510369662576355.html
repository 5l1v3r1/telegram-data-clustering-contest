      <p><b>KARACHI:</b> The Sindh government on Friday lifted the ban on arms licenses across the province.</p>
      <p>According to a home ministry notification, non-prohibited bore computerized licenses will be issued after completion of all formalities.</p>
      <p>Arms licenses will be issued under Sindh Arms Licenses Act, the notification said, adding that a certain number of licenses will be issued as per quota every month.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning here that Sindh government imposed a ban on issuing new arms licenses in September 2013, in the wake of the deteriorating law and order situation in Karachi and other parts of the province.</p>
      <p>In January 2019, Sindh High Court (SHC) had directed the provincial government to devise policy for issuance of prohibited and non-prohibited arms licenses.</p>
      <p>Hearing a petition, the court said the federal governmentâ€™s ban on automatic arms licenses was not effective anymore.</p>
      <p>Additional advocate general told the court that Sindh Arms Rules had already been formed while the court directed him to enact a new policy in the light of Pakistan Arms Ordinance and Sindh Arms Rules.</p>
