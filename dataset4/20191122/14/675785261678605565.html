      <h1>How much more a Labour Government would tax you and what your pay might fall by</h1>
      <h2>Labour's manifesto has set out big plans to change the way the UK works - taking more from the rich and using it to support essential services - but who are they classing as rich? We explain all</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:31:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>The Labour Party has just unveiled <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-manifesto-policies-full-confirmed-20896520">one of the most radical plans</a> to change Britain by a major party for decades.</p>
      <p>The goal is to improve creaking services and support the worst off and make big businesses and the rich pay for it.</p>
      <p>But who are they classing as rich?</p>
      <p>On the surface it's pretty clear - no change to income tax or national insurance for 95% of the country - with just the best-earning 5% paying more.</p>
      <p>In their own words: “We’ll ask those who earn more than £80,000 a year to pay a little more income tax, while freezing National Insurance and income tax rates for everyone else.”</p>
      <p>Labour plans to tax people 45% tax on earnings over £80,000 (up from 40%) while earnings above £125,000 a year will be hit with a 50p tax band.</p>
      <p>You can see exactly how this will your income tax will - or won't - change with <a href="https://calculate.forlabour.com/">this calculator</a> .</p>
      <p>But things aren't quite that simple - with some seeing pay rises and others seeing their take-home pay falling as a result of policies in other parts of the manifesto.</p>

      <p>The first direct pay impact is pretty good news for people working in the public sector.</p>
      <p>For years the Conservative Party has frozen wages for public sector workers - making them effectively poorer as bills rise and their earnings don't.</p>
      <p>Labour has vowed to reverse this - saying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-pledges-5-public-sector-20929532">public sector workers will see their wages rise 5%</a> , or £1,643 a year on average.</p>
      <p>People on the minimum wage will also see earnings rise - especially if they're under 25.</p>
      <p>That's because Labour has pledged to introduce a "Real Living Wage" of at least £10 an hour for all workers aged 16 and over.</p>
      <p>New mums and dads will also get a boost, with maternity and paternity pay changes adding as much as £2,226 to new parent's incomes (£2,000 for mums, £226 for dads).</p>
      <p>But the marriage allowance - offering couples where one partner doesn't work a £250-a-year tax break - will go.</p>

      <p>People on low-incomes and self-employed workers outside the public sector are also due a 3% pay rise thanks to the manifesto - but it's one that would see the amount of cash they receive each month drop.</p>
      <p>That's thanks to the plan to extend pension entitlements to those earning less than £10,000 a year per job or working for themselves.</p>
      <p>Currently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/savings-revolution-leaves-14million-workers-13749233">14million people are excluded</a> from the scheme that sees bosses forced to boost workers' pay by at least 3% if that money's saved into a pension for them.</p>
      <p>The downside is that to get the boost you need to save 5% of your pay yourself as well - seeing the amount you take home each month drop.</p>
      <p>But overall, it's something that will see people better off.</p>
      <p>Aegon pensions director Steven Cameron said: “Labour’s commitment to look to widen access for the low paid and self-employed to auto enrolment schemes is welcome and likely to be mirrored by all parties.”</p>
      <p>There are other changes that could see the self-employed lose out though - as a fallout from changes designed to tax the rich more.</p>
      <p>Seeing bosses and owners pull money our of companies in the form of dividends, rather than as wages, Labour said it would tax these.</p>
      <p>The danger is this will spill over to affect more than just billionaires trying to beat tax by sending company profits to wives living in Monaco.</p>
      <p>Rachael Griffin, tax expert at Quilter, said: "There are around five million self-employed workers in the UK and a number of these will pay themselves through dividends taken from the companies they run to provide their services, and as such this will have a significant impact on the way they run their businesses."</p>
