      <p>Harry Styles has revealed that he stayed away from drugs during his time in One Direction, because he didn’t want to “f*** up” their success.</p>
      <p>Back in August, the 25-year-old admitted that he took magic mushrooms while he was recording his new album, Fine Line.</p>
      <p>During an interview with Zane Lowe on his Apple Music radio show, the singer said he decided to experiment with drugs once he became a solo artist, because he was too afraid to before.</p>
      <p>“When I was in the band, it was like, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us that I kind of felt like, I’m not going to be the one who f**** it up,” he confessed.</p>

      <p>“So I was like, now is the time in my life when you probably go out and experiment and do this and you take this and you do that and that’s what you do with your friends.”</p>
      <p>“And I was like, I’m not going to be the guy who messes it up. So I was like, I’m not going to do any of that stuff.”</p>

      <p>Speaking about recording Fine Line at Malibu’s famous Shangri-La studios, Harry said: “Making this record felt like, I just felt so much more joyous and I was with my friends and we were in Malibu. I felt so safe.”</p>
      <p>“It was like, I want to take some mushrooms, now is the time to have fun. We’re in Malibu, 24, I’m also in music.”</p>
      <p>Fine Line is set for release on December 13.</p>
