      <p>TV Personality, Nana Aba Anamoah has hit back at some elements within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) who are bent on dragging her reputable image in the mud simply because she shared an opinion on their style of governance few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The GHOne newscaster blasted President Akufo-Addo for always jabbing his immediate predecessor, John Dramani Mahama on his failings when he was in power instead of focusing on his job.</p>
      <p>“The president today in the Volta Region should be telling us exactly how many jobs he has created in the Volta Region alone, he shouldn’t be reminding us of what John Mahama didn’t do or said and hadn’t said. We are not interested in that. There are problems in the Volta Region, he should be telling us what he has done to address those problems,” Nana Aba Anamoah stated.</p>
      <p>Her comment attracted several attacks from some NPP stalwarts who called or sorts of names, including ashawo (whore).</p>
      <p>In a fresh interview with famous comedian, actor and satirist, Kwaku Simtim Misa (KSM) which is yet to be aired, the mother of one disclosed that she will not be moved or gagged by those frivolous insults.</p>
      <p>She said;</p>
      <p><b>“Who I sleep with does not affect the price of kenkey. The NPP release their attack dogs on me for something I said, I don’t know why in 2019 political communicators still think calling a woman an ashawo will gag her in anyway. Maybe it will gag other women but not me. Ashawo is an overused insult”</b>.</p>
