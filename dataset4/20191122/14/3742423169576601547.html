      <h1>Use 'Summits' As A Field Guide To Mountain Climbing</h1>

      <p><a href="https://summits.com/">Summits</a> is a mountain-by-mountain guide to climbing. Each mountain in the Summits database has its own page with detailed climbing directions both quantitative and qualitative, making it a great way to prepare to visit a particular mountain, or even choose which mountain to climb.</p>
      <p>Each mountain’s page includes a natural history of the mountain, a description of the surroundings, a photo gallery, and the mountain’s human history: who’s climbed it, local attitudes toward it, how the mountain features in local customs and religious traditions. There are guides to support facilities, local regulations and required permits, and suggested itineraries. Summits aims to prepare climbers for the entire experience of a particular mountain.</p>
      <p>The site grades each mountain according to a <a href="https://summits.com/about-summits-index">Summits Index</a>, which calculates each mountain’s climbing difficulty, based on its height, the difficulty of the terrain, the available support facilities and geographical accessibility—how hard it is to get to the mountain in the first place.</p>
      <p>While the site currently only covers Southeast Asia, it plans to build out its index for mountains around the world, using crowdsourced info to grade everything from major mountains to neighbourhood hills.</p>
