      <h1>Report: Tottenham can sign Lille midfielder Boubakary Soumare for £43million</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:45:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzzsport.fr/buzz/foot/mercato-losc-un-joueur-a-plus-de-50-millions-deuros-98241">French outlet Buzz Sport have claimed</a> that Lille president Gerard Lopez could be willing to sell highly-rated midfielder Boubakary Soumare for £43million – amid reported interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Soumare, 20, has earned a reputation as one of the best young central midfielders in European football. He has clocked up 55 senior appearances for Ligue 1 side Lille, proving crucial in last season’s Champions League pursuit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994516/sources-tottenham-mourinho-target-luis-campos-for-sporting-director-role">As per ESPN</a>, Tottenham have already raided Lille for two of Mourinho’s new-look backroom staff. Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos have both left Lille for Spurs – becoming assistant manager and goalkeeping coach at the north London club.</p>
      <p>But Spurs are reportedly not stopping there. It is believed Spurs want France youth international Soumare, as well as Lille’s Nigeria international Victor Osimhen, <a href="https://www.jeunesfooteux.com/LOSC-Mercato-enorme-coup-dur-pour-Lille-et-Galtier-_a39165.html">according to Jeunes Footeux.</a> Now, the latest reports claim he is available for £43million.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Do Tottenham need Soumare, especially at £43million?</h3>
      <p>Spurs have plenty of options in the middle of the park in the form of Harry Winks, Eric Dier, Moussa Sissoko and Victor Wanyama. The signing of Tanguy Ndombele has also added cover in central midfield.</p>
      <p>Oliver Skipp is breaking through, so is it really necessary for Spurs to splash a huge £43million on a player where they are already well stocked? Probably not. Soumare is a top player, but Spurs should spent their money elsewhere.</p>
