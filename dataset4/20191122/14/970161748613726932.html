      <p>Anyone looking to get their hands on a discounted Fitbit activity tracker for Black Friday may have had their prayers answered.</p>
      <p>Black Friday itself may be a whole week away, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/amazon-black-friday-deals-live-as-echo-kindle-and-alexa-gadgets-get-discounts-11195617/">Amazon has already got into the sales spirit</a>.</p>
      <p>The online retailer is <a href="https://amzn.to/2qFiAES">offering the Fitbit Charge 3 with over £50 knocked off the price for a limited time only</a>. The deal brings the price down from £130 to £75 but is only running for the next nine hours (at time of writing).</p>
      <p>The Charge 3 is the best of the business when it comes to Fitbit’s wristband line-up.</p>
      <p>It’s waterproof up to 50 meters and lets you track your swimming as you would a run or a cycle. It’s also got a bigger battery which (Fitbit says) will net you up to seven days of life on a single charge. Last year’s Charge 2 could only manage five.</p>

      <p>There’s also a (slightly) refined design with an OLED screen that’s nearly 40% lighter and brighter than the Charge 2. It’s also now made from aluminium to make it lighter but Fitbit has kept the interchangeable straps so you can add a bit of personalisation.</p>

      <p>The Charge 3 has got added notifications when paired with your phone. You’ll be able to see alerts from select apps, calls, calendar reminders and texts.</p>
      <p>Fitbit itself has also been in the news recently after agreeing to be acquired by Google.</p>
      <p>So if you want to get a head start on any New Year fitness ambitions, this is a deal well worth taking advantage of.</p>
