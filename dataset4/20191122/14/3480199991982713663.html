      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn served oatcakes to his wife from a food takeaway boat and painted plates but still faced hecklers as he continued his election campaign on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was greeted by a couple of jeers as he left B’Oatcake canal boat in Stoke-on-Trent, and also shouts of “IRA lover” as he left a rally in Fenton Town Hall.</p>
      <p>For his first visit of the day, he visited Peregrine Pottery where he was presented with the gift of a mug which said “Jeremy” on the side and “for PM” on the bottom.</p>
      <p>He was also given a plate with a rose in the middle and the words “register to vote” written on it – which the Labour leader commented on, saying: “Now this is the important one”.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn then donned an apron and had a go at painting a plate using some shaped sponge stamps.</p>
      <p>After his trip to the pottery, Mr Corbyn then visited the the takeaway boat where his wife asked him for a double cheese oatcake with honey, a North Staffordshire speciality.</p>
      <p>Through the serving hatch, he replied: “There’s no honey, not today.</p>
      <p>“You can have double cheese but no honey, you’re sweet enough as it is, you don’t need honey.”</p>

      <p>As he left the boat, two men standing on a bridge above the canal booed the Labour leader, to which he responded by smiling at them and saying “nice to see you, OK”.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was greeted by a friendlier crowd when he spoke at a rally in Fenton Town Hall.</p>

      <p>He was welcomed by his familiar chant before being given a huge ovation by around 100 people who managed to gather in the hall.</p>
      <p>Before departing the city, Mr Corbyn had shouts directed at him which described him as an “IRA lover”.</p>
      <p>A man, dressed in a Northern Ireland-themed flag, did not get a response from Mr Corbyn as he had already got into a car to leave.</p>
