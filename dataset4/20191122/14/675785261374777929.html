      <h1>Woman hanged herself in boyfriend's flat after row over the phone</h1>
      <h2>Katherine Ahn, 33, moved to Italy from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, but took her own life last year as her boyfriend discovered her lifeless on his kitchen floor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:42:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, Stephanie Wareham, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/, Joe Morgan</a></address>
      <p>A young woman hanged herself in her boyfriend's Milan home after rowing with him on the phone.</p>
      <p>Katherine Ahn moved to Italy to work as a personal assistant to a Chief Executive Officer, where she met her boyfriend, Yaniv Turgerman.</p>
      <p>But in the days before her death, she resigned.</p>
      <p>A coroner heard the 33-year-old's consultant boyfriend Yaniv Turgerman had gone on an overnight stay beside Lake Como, but when he returned to his Milan home, he discovered her dead in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>An inquest held in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where her body was repatriated for a funeral, heard evidence from Chief Executive Matteo Lei, who runs the medical technology firm.</p>
      <p>Mr Turgerman had left the company a week before her death, and the coroner heard, shortly afterwards, she had emailed her resignation.</p>

      <p>The bereaved boyfriend said: "I thought she was waiting for me in the dark, I thought it was quite sad.</p>
      <p>"She was lying lifeless. I had a panic attack, I only remember trying to contact my former employer and friend.</p>
      <p>"I left the apartment screaming asking for help."</p>
      <p>Neighbour Salomence Concetta heard a man shouting "no, no, no, why did she do it" and rushed to his aid.</p>
      <p>Mr Lai described Katherine as having an "exceptional work ethic with mood swings".</p>
      <p>He said: "Her performance depended on her feelings. I received an email saying she was going to resign. She said she felt she wanted to go back to London to look after her parents."</p>
      <p>Just before 9.30pm on September 14, 2018, Mr Lai received five phone calls from former employee and friend Yaniv Turgerman.</p>
      <p>He said: "Katherine and Yaniv had a relationship but they always showed the highest professionalism.</p>
      <p>"I managed to answer the fifth phone call, I thought it unusual trying to contact me so persistently. I said 'I am busy, is it urgent? Can I call you back,' but I heard sobbing and moaning.</p>
      <p>"Soon after I heard 'why did you do this, how could you do this, no no no.'</p>
      <p>"It seemed something very serious was happening to my friend."</p>
      <p>Matteo was on the phone for eight minutes as he travelled to Mr Turgerman's property in Via Foppa, Milan.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard that on Matteo's arrival, Yaniv told him he had been at Lake Como and came back to find his girlfriend dead. In his evidence, Yaniv said: "I worked as a consultant until September 7, 2018.</p>
      <p>"I never lived with Katherine, she had the keys to my apartment. I went to Lake Como on September 13 and returned on September 14 at around 9.30pm. Before leaving for Como we had an argument over the phone.</p>
      <p>"I did not pay attention, I was talking to my friends and she possibly took offence. She put the phone down. I was sorry about talking like this but she said she had a personal crisis."</p>
      <p>Pathologist Dr Vera Morelli said her body had been there for some time before she was found. <br/>The medical cause of death was confirmed as mechanical asphyxia due to hanging.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner Crispin Butler concluded that Katherine died as a result of suicide.</p>
