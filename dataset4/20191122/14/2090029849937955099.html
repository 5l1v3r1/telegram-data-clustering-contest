      <p>The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year.</p>
      <p>Last year it had its lowest ratings ever and drew criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity.</p>
      <p>The lingerie giant’s parent company, L Brands, confirmed the end of the holiday runway extravaganza in an earnings call on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We’re figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers,” Stuart Burgdoerfer, L Brands chief financial officer, told investors on an earnings call.</p>
      <p>The brand has also faced declining sales figures and a fall in the number of viewers tuning into watch the catwalk showcase. The decision was part of a move to ‘evolve the messaging of the company,’ Fortune reports.</p>
