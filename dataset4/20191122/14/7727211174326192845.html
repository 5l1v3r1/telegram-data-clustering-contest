      <h2>Six of Everton's seven league fixtures will be broadcast throughout the month</h2>

      <p>When the Premier League fixtures were announced this summer, many Everton eyes were drawn to the month of December.</p>
      <p>Along with games against four of the supposed 'Big 6', the Toffees side kick-off the month against high-flying Leicester City.</p>
      <p>With eight games in the space of 28 days, it's a month that promises to define the second half of Everton's season - and potentially the future of manager Marco Silva.</p>
      <p>Only one of Everton's forthcoming league games - Newcastle United on Saturday December 28th - <i>won't</i> be televised, with the rest being broadcast across Sky Sports, BT Sport and newcomer <a href="https://amzn.to/33a6G36">Amazon</a> .</p>
