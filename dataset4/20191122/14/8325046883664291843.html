        <li>“I know exactly who it is,” the president said, describing the official as a “political operative.”</li>
        <li>The hosts stressed that they did not know the identity of the whistleblower, whose identity is shielded under federal laws.</li>
        <li>“You don’t need verification,” Trump replied. “You know exactly who it is.”</li>

      <p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBwoDReTflI">lengthy and rambling interview on “Fox &amp; Friends” on Friday</a>, President Donald Trump accused the hosts of lying when they said they didn’t know the identity of the Ukraine whistleblower.</p>
      <p>In the interview, Trump attacked Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who has led <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">the impeachment inquiry</a> sparked <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/read-declassified-whistleblower-complaint-ukraine-trump-zelensky-2019-9">by the whistleblower’s complaint</a>.</p>
      <p>“I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower, who is a fake whistleblower,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>“I know exactly who it is,” the president added, describing the official as a “political operative.”</p>
      <p>Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade, and Ainsley Earhardt said they did not know the whistleblower’s name, to which Trump replied, “I don’t believe you.”</p>
      <p>Here’s the full exchange:</p>
      <p><b>Doocy:</b> You said we know the name of the whistleblower, but we have no idea.</p>
      <p><b>Trump:</b> I don’t believe you.</p>
      <p><b>Kilmeade:</b> OK.</p>
      <p><b>Doocy:</b> We’ve seen names online, but we have no verification.</p>
      <p><b>Trump:</b> You don’t need verification. You know exactly who it is.</p>
      <p>The president went on to accuse the hosts of lying as he sought to pressure them to concede they knew the name of the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think Steve has ever told a lie, but that one? Come on,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, conservative activists and media outlets have published the name of an official they claim is the whistleblower, though <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/legal-implications-of-outing-the-whistleblower/">federal laws are designed to ensure the anonymity of whistleblowers</a>.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for the whistleblower have said that exposing their identity would put their life at risk.</p>
      <p>The president has described the official as a partisan operative and called on news outlets to name them but has so far backed away from doing so himself.</p>
      <p>Fox News has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/media/fox-news-whistleblower/index.html">barred employees</a> from using the alleged name of the whistleblower on air.</p>
      <p>Business Insider has been unable to verify the identity of the whistleblower so is not publishing the name of the official alleged to be that person.</p>
      <p>In the interview, Trump also called the impeachment inquiry a partisan plot and said that the results of an investigation into the origins of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russa probe would be “historic.”</p>
      <p>When discussing the unfounded allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Trump said, in an apparent slip of the tongue, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-wants-always-corruption-in-fox-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">“I do want corruption, always.”</a></p>
