      <h1>Ant McPartlin's ex Lisa Armstrong pats dog amid battle for Hurley</h1>
      <h2>It is not yet known who will keep full custody of Hurley but for the moment he splits his time between Ant and Lisa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:03:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Lisa Armstrong is battling with her ex Ant McPartlin over who gets custody of chocolate Labrador Hurley.</p>
      <p>The make-up artist was every inch the dog lover as she stopped going about her day-to-day activity to pet a stranger's pooch at the Co-op.</p>
      <p>Dog owner Lisa, 43, was happy while she greeted the furry creature who was waiting faithfully outside the Co-op for his owner.</p>
      <p>The casually-clad star carried out her visit to the shop in leggings and a hoodie dressed with a coat for an added layer in the chilly weather.</p>
      <p>But despite the colder weather chilling the country, the Strictly personality still sheltered her eyes with sunglasses.</p>
      <p>For the moment, Ant agreed to share custody of the chocolate Labrador with Lisa following their split last year.</p>

      <p>The former couple clashed over who got to keep Hurley so now the chocolate lab splits his time between their two homes.</p>
      <p>It comes as Lisa has rejected a proposed settlement of £31million - half of Ant's £62million fortune - as well as their former marital home in London's upmarket Chiswick.</p>
      <p>Instead, Lisa's said to be wanting her day in court and has so far refused to sign Ant's non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that would be part of any financial settlement her legal team thrashes out with his.</p>
      <p>Last week she savagely liked several tweets slating Ant and his new girlfriend - Lisa's former friend and personal assistant - Anne-Marie Corbett, and begged followers: "Don't believe the lies."</p>

      <p>It is not yet known who will keep full custody of Hurley.</p>
      <p>Ant has also added to his brood of dogs as he and Anne-Marie got two Maltipoo puppiesBack Milo and Bumble in February.</p>
      <p>The couple - who are out in Australia for I'm A Celeb filming - splashed out around £2,000 on two fluffy white dogs.</p>

      <p>The puppies are a cross between a Maltese terrier and a poodle and sell for around £1,000 each.</p>
      <p>It's unlikely that Hurley is unlikely to have felt too unsettled by Ant's split from Lisa</p>
      <p>Dog behaviourist and trainer <a href="http://www.dog-ease.co.uk/">Adem Fehmi</a> told us: "Dogs can deal with change like we can.</p>
      <p>"They can be very tolerant, although it does depend on the individual dog...</p>
      <p>"[Often divorce can be better for the animal] as stressful environments and arguments can cause problems [for the dog].</p>
      <p>"After splits that's decreased... Chocolate Labs tend to be very robust, they don't tend to be stressy. They're a very good breed."</p>
