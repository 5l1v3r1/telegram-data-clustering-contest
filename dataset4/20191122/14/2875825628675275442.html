      <p>It comes after the 20-year-old influencer shared a defiant clapback after receiving cruel comments about her body.</p>
      <p>The blonde bombshell had stripped down to a white bikini for a photoshoot in Barbados earlier this week, but nasty commenters felt the need to tear her apart over her natural shape.</p>
      <p>In response, Molly published a picture of her bum covered in white netted trousers yesterday, captioning it: "To the people that are kind, thank you."</p>

      <p>It comes after ITV sources confirmed this year's Love Island Christmas Reunion special won't be filmed, with some stars of this summer's series said to be annoyed they've been 'ignored' by bosses.</p>
      <p>Since Caroline Flack brought back the series in 2015, only in 2018 have the stars of the summer show got together again for a special December episode.</p>
      <p>It was full of drama as warring exes who have been slating each other over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> set eyes on each other for the first time since leaving Majorca.</p>

      <p>But ITV bosses have quietly axed the one-off special.</p>
      <p>"The cast don't think there are any plans for a Christmas reunion like last year, but they haven't been given a straight answer," an insider told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/reality/love-island-christmas-special-reunion-20914334">OK! Online</a> .</p>
      <p>"A few of the islanders have seen the producers since leaving the villa and there was a bit of a reunion at the ITV Palooza last week and the topic was brought up but quickly shut down.</p>
      <p>"Questions were asked about the possibility of an on-screen reunion, but they were all ignored by producers."</p>
      <p>Instead, ITV is focusing on its brand new Love Island Winter series, which starts filming in South Africa in January, hosted by the Flackster.</p>
