        <b>Glint, a London-based fintech startup that enables users to store, spend and save their wealth in gold, has come out of administration after securing £5.7 million from investors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Glint went into administration in September after failing to secure funding to repay an outstanding loan. <br/><br/>However, with the new financing in place, regulators have given the green light for management to take back control, with support from the board and major shareholders, says a statement.<br/><br/>For the last two months, customer accounts have been frozen, but Glint says that all funds are safe, with gold stored in a Swiss vault and fiat money in segregated accounts. Lloyds Bank has now unfrozen accounts and normal service will resume next week.<br/><br/>Jason Cozens, CEO, Glint, says: “I understand the frustration of our customers, and I can only apologise for the inconvenience caused by the disruption, which led to accounts being suspended.”</p>
