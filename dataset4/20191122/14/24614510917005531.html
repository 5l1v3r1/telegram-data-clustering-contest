      <p>We are getting closer to a buying opportunity on Bitcoin.</p>

      <p><a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/jeff-clarks-market-minute-heres-whats-next-for-bitcoin-jcmm/">The last time we looked at the King of Cryptocurrencies</a> was exactly one month ago. Back then, Bitcoin was trading for $8,167.</p>
      <p>I didn’t like the setup. It looked to me like Bitcoin had more work to do on the downside. And, I advised traders to wait for lower prices before buying the cryptocurrency…</p>
      <p>Of course, just to prove me wrong, the price of Bitcoin rallied immediately. It shot up as high as $9,500 per coin just two weeks later. Since then, though, the sellers have been in control. Bitcoin closed yesterday at $7,802. And the price has now reached a critical point.</p>
      <p>Take a look at this chart…</p>

      <p>Bitcoin is hovering just above the mid-October low of about $7,400 per coin. That’s an important <a href="https://www.jeffclarktrader.com/glossary/#support">support level</a>. Bitcoin bulls need the cryptocurrency to stay above that level, and form a higher low right here, in order to create the conditions<br/>for an intermediate-term rally.</p>
      <p>If the price of Bitcoin dips below $7,400, then the next support is $7,000. Below that level there’s a big gap lower to the next support level around $5,500.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin can find support around the current level and turn higher from here, then it will form a “higher low” on the chart. That’s the first step towards establishing a bottom on the chart, and starting a new leg higher.</p>
      <p>But, Bitcoin doesn’t have a lot of room for error here. It needs to turn higher soon, or else suffer the potential for a sharp move lower.</p>
      <p>Aggressive traders can buy Bitcoin right here and keep a tight stop at about $7,500 per coin. Conservative traders might wait for Bitcoin to climb back above its 9-day <a href="https://www.jeffclarktrader.com/glossary/#ema">exponential moving average</a> (the squiggly red line on the chart) – which would confirm that a higher low is in place – before jumping into the trade.</p>
      <p>Best regards and good trading,</p>

      <p>You won’t believe who’s getting in on 5G…</p>
      <p>Warren Buffett famously shunned tech stocks for years. But recently, Berkshire Hathaway invested $1.9 billion in Charter Communications — a company testing 5G in six U.S. markets.</p>
      <p>Through his foundation, Bill Gates also has $682 million directly invested in a little-known stock positioned to benefit in a big way from 5G — Crown Castle International.</p>
      <p>And George Soros’s largest holding BY FAR is Liberty Broadband — a direct 5G play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Because these guys weren’t born yesterday. <b>They know that each generation of wireless technology has delivered huge windfalls.</b></p>
