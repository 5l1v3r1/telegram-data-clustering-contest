      <p>“I think a Range Rover,” quipped Thompson. “I think we’re all chipping in on a Range Rover. They need that for the kiddies coming — nice, roomy.”</p>
      <p><i>Us Weekly</i> also spoke with “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels, who told the magazine that he and wife Alice Berry were brainstorming some gift ideas for the couple, who announced their engagement in May.</p>

      <p>“He killed it,” she told DeGeneres of Jost popping the question. “He did, like, a whole James Bond situation. He’s got a lot behind that news desk. He’s very charming and very thoughtful and romantic. I was surprised… When someone tells you they want to share the rest of their life with you, that is just a lovely, special thing.”</p>
      <p>Johansson will host the Dec. 14 edition of <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/saturday-night-live/">“Saturday Night Live”</a>, airing Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT on <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/">Global</a>.</p>
