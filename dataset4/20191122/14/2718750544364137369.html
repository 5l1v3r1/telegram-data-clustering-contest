      <p>Before <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-will-ferrell-beck-bennett-promo.html"><i>SNL</i></a><i> </i>wraps up 2019 with a December lineup that includes <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-jennifer-lopez-scarlett-johansson-eddie-murphy-dates.html">Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Lopez, Scarlett Johannson, and Lizzo</a>, former cast member and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/will-ferrell-snl-host-november.html">new Five-Timers Club member Will Ferrell</a> returns to the show to host this weekend. In a new video the show released this week, Ferrell is joined by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-harry-styles-dog-boyfriend-sketch-video.html">Aidy Bryant</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/king-princess-cheap-queen.html">King Princess</a> for a round of very silly promos, one of which includes some hot <i>SNL </i>gossip (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-harry-styles-knows-drug-dealing-is-difficult.html">Kenan Thompson</a> has “drama with everybody,” apparently), and another in which Ferrell gets super pissed. “Are you making fun of me? Everyone’s been making fun of me all week, and I’m <i>sick of it!</i>” he yells. “Okay. Very cool energy. We love having you back, sweetheart,” Bryant tells him sarcastically.</p>
