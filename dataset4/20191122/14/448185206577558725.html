      <p><b>Moscow</b><b>: </b>Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has launched a new solution to help organizations combat advanced threats designed to evade detection by endpoint protection platforms (EPP).</p>
      <p>The new Kaspersky Sandbox automatically analyses new suspicious files and sends the decision to the installed endpoint protection platforms.</p>
      <p>As a result, organizations strengthen their protection from previously unknown threats even if they lack teams of experienced threat analysts or have limited resources, Kaspersky said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Companies, regardless of their size, need protection from threats that fly under the radar of EPP. However, enterprise-grade solutions against advanced attacks often require advanced security analysts to operate them effectively. Smaller companies can rarely afford to hire and retain such talent,” Sergey Martsynkyan, Head of B2B Product Marketing at Kaspersky, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“That’s why they need a solution, such as Kaspersky Sandbox, which can solve this issue automatically without needing to attract IT security specialists. For enterprises, deploying Kaspersky Sandbox allows a business to optimize their budgets and staffing in branch offices where there’s typically just IT department specialists who are required to do all the security work,” Martsynkyan added.</p>
      <p>According to a Kaspersky survey of IT decision-makers, 47 percent of SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) and 51 percent of enterprises say that it is becoming more difficult to differentiate between generic and advanced attacks.</p>
      <p>This means security analysts have to spend time evaluating numerous suspicious files instead of focusing on investigating, and responding to, the most critical threats.</p>
      <p>This could be even more challenging, as larger SMBs and small enterprises face an IT security talent shortage, so all the responsibilities of managing security fall on the shoulders of IT departments.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, these companies face pretty much the same threats as fully established enterprises, including advanced attacks.</p>
      <p>Unlike many threat intelligence services targeted at experienced security analysts, Kaspersky Sandbox does not require manual operations to examine the impact of risky objects, the company said. (IANS)</p>
