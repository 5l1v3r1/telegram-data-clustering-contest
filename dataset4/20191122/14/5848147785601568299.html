      <h1>Bank seeks Fraser Anning’s travel records in bank’s bankruptcy bid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:42:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/rebecca-puddy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Puddy</a></address>
      <p>Former Queensland senator Fraser Anning’s travel records are being subpoenaed from the Department of Home Affairs, as bankers attempt to locate him overseas to serve him with bankruptcy papers.</p>
      <p>Bendigo Bank subsidiary ABL Nominees is seeking to bankrupt the former Queensland senator over an unpaid debt of $185,000, understood to be related to a failed agribusiness scheme.</p>
      <p>Under Australia’s bankruptcy rules, a creditor must serve a person who is the subject of the proceedings with a petition outlining the grounds for the bankruptcy action.</p>
      <p>In a hearing in the Federal Circuit Court in Adelaide, the bank’s lawyer, Samuel Black, said Mr Anning was believed to be in the US, but remained an Australian citizen.</p>
      <p>“We just simply do not know where Mr Anning is in the United States [and] when he is returning,” Mr Black said.</p>
      <p>The court was told ABL Nominees had this week applied for bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Anning’s wife, Fiona, who is believed to be with her husband in the US.</p>
      <p>Like her husband, Mrs Anning is yet to be served with the petition.</p>
      <p>Coinciding with the legal action, Mr Anning lodged a separate complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which Mr Black said was resolved this week.</p>
      <p>It is unknown what the complaint was about.</p>

      <h3>Mr Anning’s case to return to court</h3>
      <p>It is understood two of Mr Anning’s children live in the US, with one daughter, Raia, living in South Lake Tahoe, in California.</p>
      <p>Another daughter, Titian, recently moved to Scottsdale in Arizona to open Barista Brothers, a coffee and gelato shop.</p>
      <p>Australian Electoral Commission records show Mr Anning’s Conservative National Party is registered to a home address in Gladstone, Queensland.</p>
      <p>Property records show the house is owned by Raia and her husband.</p>
      <p>Mr Anning, who lost his seat at the 2019 federal election, had no legal representation in Thursday’s hearing.</p>
      <p>The case will return to court next month.</p>

      <h3>Second time bankruptcy orders sought</h3>
      <p>This is the second time Bendigo Bank has sought a bankruptcy order against Mr Anning.</p>
      <p>Mr Anning reportedly settled the first case in October 2017, a month before he entered Parliament to replace disqualified One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts.</p>
      <p>Mr Anning’s controversial views were often in the limelight during his time in parliament, including linking the Christchurch massacre to Muslim immigration and courting the support of far-right groups.</p>
      <p>He made headlines after being struck by an egg by a teenager while speaking to the media.</p>
