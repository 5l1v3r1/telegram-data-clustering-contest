      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:57:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Two Union Territories -- Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli -- will be merged into one and a bill in this effect will be tabled in Parliament next week, Union Minister Arjun Meghwal said in the Lok Sabha on Friday.</p>
      <p>The move comes three months after <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>was bifurcated into two UTs -- Jammu and Kashmir, and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ladakh">Ladakh.</a></p>
      <p>The Dadra and Nagar Haveli and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/daman-and-diu">Daman and Diu </a>(Merger of Union Territories) Bill 2019 is part of the proposed government business for the next week, Meghwal said.</p>
      <p>Officials said the merger of the two UTs, located along the western coast near Gujarat, will be done for better administration and check duplications of various work.</p>
      <p>So far, both the UTs have separate budgets and different secretariats even though they are just 35 km apart.</p>
      <p>Dadra and Nagar Haveli has just one district while <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/daman-and-diu">Daman and Diu </a>has two.</p>
      <p>The merged UT is likely to be named as Dadra, Nagar Haveli, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/daman-and-diu">Daman and Diu </a>and its headquarters could be Daman and Diu.</p>
      <p>On August 5, the central government had announced the abrogation of the special status given to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>under <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-370">Article 370 </a>and its bifurcation into two UTs.</p>
      <p>The country currently has nine UTs after the creation of the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ladakh">Ladakh.</a> However, with the merger of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the number of UTs will come down to eight.</p>
