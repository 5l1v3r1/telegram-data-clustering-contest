        <b>Bankole Wellington, Nigerian singer turned politician better known as Banky W, has hinted that he might be releasing an album in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The gifted songwriter had joined politics few months to the 2019 general elections, where he contested to represent Eti-Osa federal constituency at the house of representatives but lost.</p>
      <p>The singer had, while speaking at an event in Lagos tagged ‘The Convergence: Power, Capacity, Politics’, said he decided to <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/banky-w-real-reasons-run-office/"><b>join politics</b></a> to help fix the country’s many challenges.</p>
      <p>His decision took many aback, his fan especially, who feared they might never get to have any song from the music superstar again.</p>
      <p>But Francis Eluozo, one of his many fans, took to Twitter months ago to announce that he missed the singer. He also appealed to him to at least drop a song.</p>
      <p>“Who else misses BankyW the singer? I love BankyW the actor, the politician, the activist but please sir still give us music. If you don’t want to do again, for goodness sake can you just make even if its one song a year, just ono,” he had posted in July.</p>

      <p>In what seemed to be an approval of the fan’s request, Banky W promised to release an album next year.</p>
      <p>“Okay.. I’m gonna do at least one more album, in 2020. Not sure if there are too many ppl who feel the same as you do, but thanks for this. I appreciate it,” he replied on Friday.</p>
