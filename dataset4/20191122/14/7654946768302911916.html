      <h1>John Ozbilgen, ex-boyfriend of missing NJ woman Stephanie Parze, found dead</h1>

      <p>A stockbroker eyed in the disappearance of a New Jersey nanny hanged himself in his parents’ garage Friday morning, law-enforcement sources said.</p>
      <p>John Ozbilgen’s father found the body of his 29-year-old son, who was the on-again, off-again boyfriend of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/new-jersey-woman-stephanie-parze-goes-missing-after-visit-to-psychic/">missing 25-year-old Stephanie Parze</a>, a source said.</p>
      <p>Monmouth County prosecutors said Ozbilgen’s death was not suspicious.</p>
      <p>Authorities had called him a “person of interest” after Parze, 25, who worked as a nanny and beautician, went missing Oct. 30. She was last seen leaving her parents’ house in Freehold at 10:30 p.m. to make the drive to her own home about seven miles away.</p>
      <p>A neighbor of Ozbilgen’s parents, Donna Herskowitz, told The Post on Friday that right after Parze’s disappearance, cops asked her for video from her outdoor surveillance system to try to spot his comings and goings in his silver SUV. Officers also had been parked in unmarked cars outside his family’s Freehold home for weeks, she said.</p>
      <p>“They had him, and he knew it,” she said.</p>
      <p>Cops were stationed outside the home when Ozbilgen’s body was discovered Friday, and his parents ran over to the officers in a desperate bid to try to help their son, the family’s lawyer said.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, [the officers] were unable to revive him,’’ said the lawyer, Richard Incremona.</p>

      <p>Parze had filed a domestic-violence complaint against Ozbilgen a month before she disappeared. When authorities got a warrant to search his cellphone, they found child pornography on it — along with 10 furious texts he sent Parze the night before she vanished, officials have said.</p>
      <p>In one text, Ozbilgen told Parze she “always has to make their relationship suck,” authorities said.</p>
      <p>Ozbilgen was a licensed stockbroker who used to live on Staten Island, but apparently moved back home with his parents when he lost his job after Parze vanished.</p>
      <p>NYPD cops have been involved, searching a park near Ozbilgen’s former home in Richmond Valley twice, sources said.</p>
      <p>They turned up nothing in the park, and have since focused their attention to woods near Freehold, a law-enforcement source said Friday.</p>
      <p>Parze’s relatives say that they are hopeful she is still alive.</p>
      <p>“We’ll keeping searching,” her sister said by phone Friday.</p>
      <p>The sibling said about 200 people had been out searching for Parze last week.</p>
      <p>Ozbilgen was facing charges over the child porn and had just been freed from jail Tuesday while awaiting his next hearing in that case.</p>

      <p>His lawyer in the porn case, Robert Honecker Jr., said he saw his client Thursday night and that he adamantly denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Incremona said, “The family obviously is distraught and has been destroyed for several weeks. They were trying to get back to as much normalcy as possible, and unfortunately, this occurred.”</p>
