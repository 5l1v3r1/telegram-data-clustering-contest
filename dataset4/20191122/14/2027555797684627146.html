      <h1>SL president to call parliamentary election in March</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:11:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Sri Lanka's new president said Friday that he will call a snap parliamentary election in March following his sweeping victory at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa is hoping to ride a wave of popularity by calling an election six months before the current parliament's five-year term expires on March 1.</p>
      <p>"I will consult the people at the earliest opportunity I get under the constitution," he said, after swearing-in a new cabinet headed by his brother Mahinda, a former president who will now serve as premier and finance minister.</p>
      <p>The brothers are credited with brutally defeating Tamil separatist militants in 2009 to end Sri Lanka's bloody civil war, making them adored among the majority Sinhalese-Buddhist majority.</p>
      <p>For the same reason, they are feared by many Tamils, and also among the Muslim minority who have seen increased hostility since Islamist extremist attacks killed 269 people in April.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Rajapaksas and their allies have just 96 lawmakers in the 225-seat parliament, making it hard for them to pass legislation.</p>
      <p>The opposition of outgoing premier Ranil Wickremesinghe is also six MPs short of a majority.</p>
      <p>The new 16-member cabinet also includes another Rajapaksa brother, Chamal, who was made a minister of agriculture and irrigation in addition to trade.</p>
      <p>Foreign affairs were given to Dinesh Gunawardena, 70, a leader of a small Sinhala nationalist party in coalition with the ruling party.</p>
      <p>The only female in the cabinet, Pavitra Wanniarachchi, will take on women's affairs and health.</p>
      <p>Nobody was named to the defense of law and order portfolios.</p>
      <p>The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month that Sri Lanka's economy was slowly recovering from the devastating effects of the April 21 attacks.</p>
      <p>But the international credit rating agency Fitch warned Thursday that the new president's pledges to increase social spending, public-sector wages and pensions could damage Sri Lanka's public finances.</p>
      <p>During Mahinda's 2005-15 presidency, Sri Lanka borrowed almost $7 billion from China for infrastructure projects -- many of which turned into white elephants mired in corruption -- pushing up Sri Lanka's debts.</p>
      <p>In a possible sign that he intends to avoid a repeat of Sri Lanka's strategic drift towards Beijing under his brother, Gotabaya's first official trip abroad will be to India next week.</p>
