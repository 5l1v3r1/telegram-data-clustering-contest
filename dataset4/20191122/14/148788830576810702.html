      <p>Cast members like <b>Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino</b> and <b>Leonardo DiCaprio</b> praise Tarantino’s obsession with Hollywood in 1969 and the meticulous attention to detail that comes with it. He has a memory of so much from that era, which is a big part of why the movie feels so authentic in its portrayal of the time. And if you need any testament to that, <b>Kurt Russell</b> chimes in with first-hand knowledge of what it was like during that time.</p>
      <p>Producers <b>David Heyman</b> and <b>Shannon McIntosh</b> chime in with their praise for the filmmaker, as well as director of photography <b>Robert Richardson</b>, who expertly captured the impeccable sets that brought old school Los Angeles back to life for one last breath before the golden age would start to fade.</p>
      <blockquote>Quentin Tarantino’s ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD visits 1969 Los Angeles, where everything is changing, as TV star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) make their way around an industry they hardly recognize anymore. The ninth film from the writer-director features a large ensemble cast and multiple storylines in a tribute to the final moments of Hollywood’s golden age.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> arrives on digital on <b>November 25</b> and Blu-ray/DVD on <b>December 10</b>.</p>
