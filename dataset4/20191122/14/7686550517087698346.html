      <h2>Edward Osei-Nketia is targeting the Olympic 100m and then he wants a rugby career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:03:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Doel</a></address>
      <p>New Zealand rugby could have unearthed a superstar of the future.</p>
      <p>Reports in the country say teenage sprint star Edward Osei-Nketia left coaches stunned after turning up at a talent identification event in Auckland.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old, who is expected to represent his country in the 100m at the Tokyo Olympics next year, has been identified as someone who could initially enter the New Zealand sevens programme.</p>
      <p>He became the fourth-fastest New Zealander in history en route to claiming the Australian 100m title in Sydney seven months ago with a time of 10.19 seconds, and he's left NZR officials in awe of his physical prowess.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen an athlete with those genetics, ever," New Zealand Rugby's high performance sevens talent ID manager PJ Williams told <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/sevens/117638830/rugby-blown-away-as-sprint-sensation-edward-oseinketia-makes-his-mark-in-sevens-trials">Stuff.</a></p>
      <p>"He is 99 per cent fast twitch muscle fibre. I've never seen an athlete like him walk through our doors in rugby, ever. And we probably never will see one again."</p>
      <p>When asked about Osei-Nketia's rugby-playing potential, Williams said: "How long is a piece of string? He has got speed, he has got size, he has got an attitude that is focused for high performance."</p>
      <p>Osei-Nketia, who is the son of Ghanaian-born New Zealand 100m record-holder Gus Nketia, has insisted he is interested in switching sports in the future after previously playing schoolboy rugby.</p>
      <p>"I was always stuck on the wing. But I could see myself as a fullback, centre and if I can pull my head straight, I could be a fly-half too. I'd need to improve on my kicking game though," he laughed.</p>
      <p>"I'm here trying to learn more as I go as a sprinter, learn the game, learn the people and learn as many different things about rugby as possible so that one day, if possible, we can make a switch and I can be on top of the game. We don't know what is going to happen, we have to keep our options open."</p>

      <p>NZR high performance sevens development manager Chad Tuoro told Stuff last month that the youngster would need to make the jump to rugby no later than 2021 if he is to succeed at an elite level in the sport.</p>
      <p>He could yet attempt to represent New Zealand at sprinting and sevens rugby at the 2024 Paris Olympics, depending how he is performing in both.</p>
      <p>"We'll take it one at a time at the moment but I would love to do both," he added.</p>
