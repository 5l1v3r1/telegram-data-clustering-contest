      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 22 — US President Donald Trump today defended his use of private lawyer Rudy Giuliani to work on Ukraine as Giuliani’s role comes under increasing scrutiny in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>A day after public hearings concluded in the House Intelligence Committee, Trump told Fox News Channel’s <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> that he directed Giuliani to tackle corruption in Ukraine because of his reputation as a “great crime fighter”.</p>
      <p>“Rudy Giuliani is one of the greatest crime fighters of all time,” Trump said of the former New York City mayor. He said Ukraine was known as a corruption country and that Giuliani was the right person for the job.</p>
      <p>Trump, assuming the House will approve articles of impeachment against him, said he wants an impeachment trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where he would presumably expect a more favourable outcome.</p>
      <p>Trump said that among the witnesses he would like to hear from in a Senate trial would be the whistleblower whose report led to the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower’s identity remains secret.</p>
      <p>“I want a trial,” he said. — Reuters</p>
