      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 22 — US President Donald Trump today said Washington and Beijing could be on the cusp of sealing a partial trade deal but reiterated he was in no hurry to sign.</p>
      <p>But Trump’s remarks were a rejoinder to statements made hours earlier by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who told a gathering of dignitaries in Beijing that China wanted a deal but was “not afraid” to fight back if needed.</p>
      <p>“We have a deal, potentially very close,” Trump said during a freewheeling interview on Fox News.</p>
      <p>“He wants to make a deal much more than I want to make it. I’m not anxious to make it.”</p>
      <p>Trump added that revenues from tariffs on Chinese imports were a windfall for the United States, something economists say is in fact weighing on the economy.</p>
      <p>The US president’s remarks did little to clarify whether the two parties are in fact making progress in finalizing the text of the “phase one” agreement Trump announced last month.</p>
      <p>China has called for a rollback of existing US tariffs as part of the agreement but US officials have said instead they could consider delaying a fresh round of duty increases that are set to take effect on December 15.</p>
      <p>The US-trade conflict is now well into its second year, with hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way trade subject to steep duties. — AFP</p>
