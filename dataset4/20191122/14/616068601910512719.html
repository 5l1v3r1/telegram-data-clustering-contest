      <p>Christmas is just around the corner and once again the Salvation Army is raising funds to help the less fortunate in the community.</p>
      <p>Lt. Stefan Reid, with the Vernon Sally Ann, said the goal this year is $500,000.</p>
      <p>“The money stays right here in Vernon to help those in need. It helps our homeless, it helps our working poor,” said Reid, adding the money will go towards addiction programs, women's programs, children and youth, men's programs and others.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot going on in our community and this fundraiser at this time of year is huge,” said Reid. “We just want to give a little bit of a glimpse of hope during this Christmas season.”</p>
      <p>But to reach their goal, the Salvation Army needs volunteers to ring those bells in a variety of locations – all of which are indoors this year.</p>
      <p>“They are two-hour shifts and we have 1,250 shifts to fill,” said Reid, adding people can <a href="http://vernonhouseofhope.com/">sign up online</a>.</p>
