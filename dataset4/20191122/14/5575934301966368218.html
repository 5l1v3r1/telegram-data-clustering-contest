        <li>Apple quietly removed the “Ratings and Reviews” section from its online store, meaning shoppers can no longer see online reviews of Apple products before they buy.</li>
        <li>The removal comes just as Apple heads into the all-important holiday season. The iPhone maker tends to see a major sales bump through the last three months of the year thanks to people buying holiday gifts.</li>
        <li>First reported by Apple Insider, the move appears to have come into force on the US, UK and Australian version of Apple’s website.</li>
        <li>Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.</li>

      <hr/>
      <p>Apple has removed all customer reviews of its products from its website, without apparent explanation.</p>
      <p>The removal was first reported <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/21/apple-pulls-all-customer-reviews-from-online-apple-store">by Apple Insider</a> on Thursday. Specifically, the tech giant has removed the “Ratings and Reviews” section from all product pages on the US, UK and Australian versions of its site.</p>
      <p>Notably, the Ratings and Reviews section of Apple’s site houses the thousands of product reviews published by customers. Shoppers were able to leave reviews and a star rating, and read reviews based on recency or usefulness. These reviews are no longer visible.</p>
      <p>Business Insider confirmed that reviews have disappeared for products listed in the UK. We compared the current online listing in the UK for the Apple Pencil 2 with an archived version of the same page. Here’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191122142556/https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU8F2ZM/A/apple-pencil-2nd-generation">a captured version of the current listing</a>, which doesn’t show a “ratings and reviews” section. And here’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191020211950/https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU8F2ZM/A/apple-pencil-2nd-generation">a capture of the same page</a> from October, which does show the reviews section.</p>
      <p>As with any company, the reviews of Apple’s products were a mix of positive and negative.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976335/apple-customer-reviews-removed-online-store-rating">The Verge noted</a> there were over 700 one-star reviews of the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor published on Apple’s site before the section was removed. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191002084242/https://www.apple.com/shop/reviews/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter">archived version of the page</a> shows hundreds of one-star reviews from customers in India, Australia, and the US.</p>
      <p>AppleInsider posted archived screengrabs of the product page for the first-gen Apple Pencil as it appeared on November 16 and November 17. The “Ratings and Reviews” section was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191116152646/https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0C2AM/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation">visible on November 16</a> but not on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191117213629/https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0C2AM/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation">November 17</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple has not, at the time of writing, released any sort of explanation or public statement on the section’s removal.</p>
      <p>Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.</p>
