      <h2>Environmental activists say they want to give "Give Boris an early wake up alarm" and plot disruption in public buildings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:31:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion is reportedly planning to set off alarms in public buildings and offices as part of a "12 days of crisis"Â  campaign during the run up to December's General Election, according to plans seen by journalists.</p>
      <p>The plan has been discussed in chats, <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/london/extinction-rebellion-to-set-off-fire-alarms-sirens/">seen by LBC, </a>on heavily encrypted messenger service Telegram.</p>
      <p>"Could setting off fire alarms in certain buildings perhaps be made part of this action?" asked the ER supporter.</p>
      <p>"Enter building, eg. a bank or govt office and set off the fire alarm. Employees file out and they get to hear climate emergency speeches from XR people with megaphones."</p>
      <p>Regarding the air raid siren plan, one organiser said: "For max disruption, you could set the siren off and then leave it in some locked box or container. Would be good in prominent places like outside Parliament, Downing St etc.</p>
      <p>"Give Boris an early wake up alarm."</p>
      <p>However, the air raid siren has divided opinion, with some ER supporters suggesting it could lose public support.</p>
      <p>One said: "I really like the idea of raising the flag and raising the alarm, but I worry that literally setting off air raid sirens will scare loads and loads of people and might do more harm than good.</p>
      <p>"I know for sure that if I was in town and heard an air raid siren go off, that I would run for cover."</p>
      <p>However, another said: "I know what you mean, but I mean, the planet is dying - that is f****** scary!"</p>
      <p>LBC has contacted Extinction Rebellion for a response.</p>
