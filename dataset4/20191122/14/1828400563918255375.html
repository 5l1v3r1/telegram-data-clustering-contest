      <p>Six fire crews responded to the blaze at the semi-detached home in Rydal Road at 5am yesterday (November 21), along with the aerial ladder platform and drone team.</p>

        <figcaption>An investigation into the fire is unable to take place because the home is deemed "too unsafe" due to structural concerns</figcaption>

      <p>Within two hours, the roof had collapsed at the home, but fire crews were able to prevent the flames spreading to the homes next door.</p>
      <p>But the fire service has since deemed both the fire-ravaged home and next door properties on either side as "unsafe".</p>
      <p>It means the homes are too unsafe to enter, which is preventing fire officers from investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
      <p>It also means the families living next door have been forced to vacate their homes immediately.</p>

      <p>Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said all three families have been re-homed in alternative accommodation.</p>
      <p>An LFRS spokesman said: "The incident has now closed from our side.</p>
      <p>"I believe that the houses either side were found alternative accommodation.</p>
      <p>"In terms of cause of fire, an investigation is not able to take place as the property is deemed unsafe to enter by a structural engineer.</p>
      <p>"The properties adjacent are being looked after and people found alternative accommodation."</p>

      <p>Three people and more than a dozen dogs were rescued from the burning home before dawn yesterday (November 21).</p>
      <p>The family, who are renowned breeders of dachshunds, suffered from smoke inhalation and received treatment at the scene.</p>
      <p>The fire service said the home had housed a "large quantity of dogs", and has stated that no dogs are believed to have died as a result of the fire.</p>
      <p>However, neighbours in Rydal Road suggested that two dogs belonging to the family have died.</p>
      <p>The RSPCA said it has taken all of the dogs into its care and is launching its own investigation into the dogs' welfare.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the RSPCA said: "We were called to a house fire in Hambleton this morning (Thursday, November 21) by the fire brigade to assist with a number of dogs at the location.</p>
      <p>"The dogs are in the RSPCAâ€™s care subject to an on-going inquiry and are not available for rehoming.</p>
      <p>"We cannot say any more at this time."</p>
