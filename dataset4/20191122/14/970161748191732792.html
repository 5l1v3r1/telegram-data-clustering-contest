      <p>A picturesque Kent village has lost its festive spirit before Christmas has even got started, after the council banned its traditional lights display.</p>
      <p>Villagers in Pembury were devastated to hear that their streets won’t be lined with twinkling lights after council officials said they breached health and safety rules.</p>
      <p>Locals said the lack of festive decorations will make for a ‘Scrooge-like’ Christmas and are frustrated they were informed so close to December.</p>
      <p>Officials at the County Hall in Maidstone have been so late telling the parish council its permit has been refused, there hasn’t been enough time to devise an alternative plan.</p>
      <p>The council said it had to ditch the beloved lights this year as they were too heavy to hang from the lamp posts.</p>
      <p>Parish councillor Louise Mills said: ‘Unfortunately, this year our High Street is going to look a little dimmer.</p>

      <p>‘Many of the columns were found to be unsafe and unable to support the weight of the Christmas light motifs of up to 8kg.</p>
      <p>‘Unfortunately, Kent County Council will only allow us to install lights around the village green that weigh under 4kg.’</p>
      <p>She added that the move was ‘hugely disappointing’ particularly as the decision came ‘so late in the day’ with little time to rectify it.</p>
      <p>Local Patrick Gillan, 63, who is starring in the village’s Christmas panto as Dame Trot, called the move ‘just mean’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It’s going to look like Scrooge made Christmas.</p>

      <p>‘It’s just mean. People will be very angry about it when they eventually realise what’s happened.</p>
      <p>‘The infuriating thing is Kent County Council left it to the last minute to tell us the lamp posts are not safe.</p>
      <p>‘It’s too late for us now.’</p>
      <p>Mr Gillan, who is a parish councillor but said he was speaking about the lights as a villager, added: ‘We don’t have a lights switch-on in the village but it would have been lovely all down the High Street.</p>
      <p>‘We’ll have wreaths of some sort down by the village green where all the posh folk are. But unfortunately, as we drive down the High Street, we won’t have them.’</p>

      <p>A Kent County Council spokesman said: ‘Pembury Parish Council has a contract with a supplier to provide Christmas lights for the village.</p>
      <p>‘We spoke to the council in July and advised testing would be required if decorations were intended to be put up this year.</p>
      <p>‘We notified them on November 6 that, following independent tests ordered by the parish council, only one column would be suitable for hanging decorations.</p>
      <p>‘We understand the council has now been able to source Christmas lights that can be safely fitted to the columns around the green, and these have been approved by Kent County Council.’</p>
