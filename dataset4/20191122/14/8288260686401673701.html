      <p>People are being urged to "give what they can" to help save a Walsall hospice – by order of the Peaky Blinders.</p>
      <p>Steven Knight, the creator of the smash hit BBC television series, has thrown his weight behind the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/walsall">Save Acorns Black Country Hospice Appeal</a>, which is just £50,000 shy of reaching the half a million mark.</p>
      <p>The rallying call from the Birmingham born writer, producer and director, comes after Acorns announced important progress in the battle to save its Black Country hospice from closure, with the charity’s board of trustees unanimously voting to remove an earlier limit on families booking stays for their children beyond March 2020.</p>

      <p>Since the proposed closure of the Walsall hospice was put on hold, the, the urgent call for donations has seen supporters spring into action to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds - but there is still a long way to go to reach the £2million target. <br/><br/>Speaking in a video message - <b>which can be viewed above</b> - Steven said: “I’m here to encourage you to help the Save Acorns Black Country Hospice Appeal. Lots of money has come in already, we just need a little bit more – we’re nearly up to half a million.</p>
      <p>“So please, if you can, give what you can. It’s a really worthwhile cause and if you do, it’s by order of the Peaky Blinders.” <br/><br/>Steven, a longstanding friend of Acorns, will be one of the stars of a special event next year, where he will be interviewed alongside Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street.</p>
      <p>In addition, Steven has generously donated a number of Garrison Tailors’ suits which are being auctioned to raise money for the appeal from now until November 28. The suits were famously worn by Birmingham City FC players to officially launch their kit for the current season’s EFL Championship.</p>
      <p>Visit  <a href="http://www.silentauctionevents.com/upcoming-auction">www.silentauctionevents.com/upcoming-auction</a>  to bid for your chance to dress like a Peaky Blinder. <br/><br/>Acorns' chief executive, Toby Porter, said: “If anyone had said to me at the start of the appeal we would be on course to raising half a million pound in just four months, I would have been amazed. This is a wonderful, generous community and we are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped us reach this milestone.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of all of us at Acorns, a huge thank you to everyone who has backed this Appeal so far and to Steven for his expression of support, which I hope will help galvanise even more people to get behind our appeal.</p>
      <p>“There is still much work to be done. We are nearly a quarter of the way to our £2million target, but with your help I am confident we can get there.</p>
      <p>" I urge everyone to see what they can do to support the Appeal. Large or small, it doesn’t matter – it all makes a difference for our ability to help any child and family in the Black Country that will need us in the future.”</p>
