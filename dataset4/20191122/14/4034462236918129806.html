      <p>The Thanksgiving holiday is just around the corner, which of course means automakers will be slashing prices for Black Friday. For the 2020 model year, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang-bullitt">Ford Mustang Bullitt</a> was given a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ford-mustang-bullitt-has-one-significant-change-for-2020">$1,200 price bump</a>, but taking advantage of this secret discount discovered by <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/ford-boosts-mustang-discounts-again-for-black-friday">CarsDirect </a>will lower the price considerably.</p>
      <p>The deal won't be advertised on TV or online, but Ford is giving dealers up to $3,500 in dealer cash to help lower prices and clear inventories, reducing the Ford Mustang Bullitt's starting price from $47,690 down to $44,190. The Ford Mustang Bullitt was launched last year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the pony car's appearance in the 1968 film 'Bullitt.'</p>

      <p>Exclusive features for the Ford Mustang Bullitt include a white cue ball shifter, green stitching on the seats, and unique Highland Green paint matching the original movie car. The 5.0-liter V8 also gets a power bump up to 480 horsepower sent through a six-speed manual, which is the only transmission option.</p>
      <p>According to a bulletin sent to dealers, Ford is also combining a trade-in bonus with 0% financing. As of November 14, trading in a 1995 or newer vehicle entitles customers to a $1,000 trade-in bonus in most parts of the US. In places like Detroit, this deal is worth as much as $2,000.</p>

      <p>This can also be used with Ford's current zero percent financing offer, which means this month is a great time to buy a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">2019 Ford Mustang</a> if you've been on the fence. Hopefully, this will help give Mustang sales a boost, as Ford's muscle car was outsold by the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger-coupe">Dodge Challenger</a> in the third quarter. In the same period, Mustang sales <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/dodge-challenger-dominates-mustang-and-camaro-sales-war">dropped by 12.3 percent to 16,823 examples</a>.</p>
      <p>A dealer incentive bulletin shows Ford is offering 20 percent off MSRP on most models, but we could see even better deals offered closer to Black Friday.</p>
