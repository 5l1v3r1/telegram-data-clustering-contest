        <b>Students at a Suffolk school are determined to raise hundreds of pounds after thieves broke in and stole money which pupils had raised for charity.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bawdsey Primary School, in School Road, was burgled during Wednesday night, with a safe containing Â£200 stolen.</p>
      <p>However, the school's 60 students have set themselves the task of replacing the cash - which the headteacher said was mostly made up of pocket money.</p>
      <p>The safe has now been replaced with a box made at home by one of the students, who are determined to not let the burglary spoil their Christmas.</p>
      <p>Katie Butler, the school's headteacher, said: "The children had put a lot of effort into raising the money. Part of the school's ethos is to help those who are less fortunate. "It is sad that someone has taken this money away."</p>
      <p>Mrs Butler said the money had been raised through cake sales, including a Macmillan coffee morning, as well as student-led tours.</p>
      <p>The cash was to be donated to causes such as Macmillan, the Poppy Appeal and the school's Christmas lunch.</p>
      <p>Despite the setback, Mrs Butler said she and her team had been inspired by the students' reaction to the setback.</p>
      <p>Mrs Butler added: "For the children to turn up again with their pocket money is inspiring.</p>
      <p>"It is a sad state of affairs that someone has taken all this money.</p>
      <p>"But the children have found a way of being good samaritans."</p>
