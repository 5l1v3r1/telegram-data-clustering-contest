      <h1>West Brom boss Slaven Bilic has his say on midfield conundrum</h1>
      <h2>Albion manager Slaven Bilic says he has made his mind up on his midfield partnership ahead of their clash with Sheffield Wednesday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The Yorkshire club travel to the Black Country tomorrow and face an Albion side missing stalwart midfielders Romaine Sawyers and Jake Livermore.</p>
      <p>The pair will miss the match through suspension, opening the door for several team-mates to fill the void.</p>
      <p>Gareth Barry, Chris Brunt, Semi Ajayi and Rekeem Harper are all bidding for a place in Bilic's starting XI but the Croatian insists his mind is already made up on who will get an opportunity.</p>
      <p>"Yes I am (clear on decision), I've had enough time here," he said.</p>
      <p>"The game against Hull was two weeks ago and I went through all the combinations.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately I couldn't do them on the pitch because some of the players were missing and on internationals.</p>
      <p>"But it isn't going to be a massive difference, I'm going to try and make as less changes as possible.</p>
      <p>"Not in personnel because we have to, but in the way we play.</p>
      <p>"You don't want a confusion – sometimes it surprises the opponents but shocks your players.</p>
      <p>"We want to keep the players quite comfortable.</p>
      <p>"It's true that we are without a couple of players that have been instrumental for us.</p>
      <p>"The skipper and the guy who has the most passes in the league.</p>
      <p>"But there's no time to cry, there's no reason to cry.</p>
      <p>"Yes it's a blow but it's all about the squad.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to talk about players that are not playing or the negatives.</p>
      <p>"We have a good team, we are fit enough and we are ready for them."</p>
      <p>Ahmed Hegazi, Grady Diangana and Ajayi all played international games during the break and Bilic also confirmed that they returned injury free.</p>
      <p>"They all came back, no injuries," he added.</p>
      <p>"All of them played, Ahmed played a couple of games which was important for him.</p>
      <p>"Semi played a couple of games that maybe he didn't need to.</p>
      <p>"But like every other situation it's good.</p>
      <p>"On one hand you have your players with you but being an international player it gives you another dimension, another motivation.</p>
      <p>"There are a lot of positives in that."</p>
      <p>While several first team players got minutes under their belt in a reserve game earlier this week, adding to Bilic's options for the weekend.</p>
      <p>He added: "It was Kieran (Gibbs), Gareth (Barry), Chris (Brunt) and Rekeem (Harper) also.</p>
      <p>"They did well.</p>
      <p>"Chris came off at half-time, he felt his calf so he's missed a couple of days.</p>
      <p>"He (Barry) played 60 minutes.</p>
      <p>"If you look at a player that was out for so long, is 60 minutes enough.</p>
      <p>"If it wasn't Gareth Barry you'd say he needs more, but because of who he is he bossed that game.</p>
      <p>"I'm glad he's giving me opportunities and we'll see.</p>
      <p>"He is also (an option).</p>
      <p>"Not just because of Semi, but because of Ahmed.</p>
      <p>"Then again, like everyone other situation, there's pluses and minuses.</p>
      <p>"We have a few options and we'll see tomorrow."</p>
      <p>The Owls are winless in their last three fixtures, but picked up draws against both Swansea and Leeds in those games.</p>
      <p>And Bilic is aware of the threat they pose.</p>
      <p>"They are a good team, they are like a proper team," he said.</p>
      <p>"They are men, there are no kids in that team.</p>
      <p>"They are positive, they run and they engage – they make it very hard for you.</p>
      <p>"Every game is difficult but this is a difficult game, not because of the players we are missing, but because of the strength of the opponent."</p>
