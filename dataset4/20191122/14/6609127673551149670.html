      <p>Earlier this week Holly confessed she "never" wants her children to leave home.</p>
      <p>The host opened up on the worrying notion of an empty nest during a phone in with Vanessa Feltz.</p>
      <p>One caller told how she felt bad going to university next near and leaving her mum, who said she would "miss" her, behind.</p>
      <p>This prompted comments from both Vanessa and This Morning co-presenter Phil Schofield about how upset they were when their children left home for further education.</p>
      <p>Phil said he and his wife were in "floods of tears" when they arrived home, leaving Holly looking visibly worried.</p>

        <figcaption>Holly spoke out in a debate about family guilt on the ITV daytime series</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Joining in the debate, she admitted she was "a bit behind" that scenario as her eldest Harry, is only aged ten.</p>
      <p>Yet in a candid insight into family life she said: "I never want my children to leave, that's a fact.</p>
      <p>"If they want to stay with me forever then that's fine for me."</p>
      <p>Yet she conceded when they grew up they would have her full support and be "so proud" to see them go and live their lives.</p>

      <p>She added: "It will be tough but by doing that, you will be giving them the best present."</p>
      <p>Holly is notoriously quiet over her family life, particularly on social media.</p>
      <p>Yet this summer, taking to Instagram, Holly posted a sweet snap of her eldest two kids heading into the sea on a sunny day.</p>
      <p>She captioned it: "Well that was lovely...#brotherandsister."</p>

      <p>Celebrity Juice judge Holly also let slip her eldest's hilarious sense of humour as they enjoyed holiday banter.</p>
      <p>Holly revealed that the ten-year-old had joked there was a shark swimming closely behind her.</p>
      <p>Alongside the holiday snap, she wrote: "‘Mummy, look, shark!’ #hethinkshesfunny#tbthursday #wishiwasthere".</p>
