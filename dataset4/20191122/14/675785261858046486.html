      <h2>Inter Milan are second in Serie A and just a point behind leaders Juventus after Antonio Conte arrived in the summer - and there is a secret reason behind their success</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:31:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Antonio Conte has given his Inter Milan aces the golden rules to having sex during the Serie A season.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> manager Conte joined Inter in the summer and has managed to keep them hot on the tail of reigning champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Inter are just a point behind Juve having won 10 of their opening 12 matches - with their only defeat coming against the Turin based giants.</p>
      <p>Conte has explained that one of the reasons behind his side's form is his rules into the players' love lives.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old has decreed his stars must put limited effort into intercourse, always be on the bottom and only be intimate with their own wives.</p>

      <p>"Competition for me is battle," he told L'Equipe. "It is 'your death, my life'. I am very focused on the fact that in the end there should only be one left standing and I do everything to make it my team. </p>
      <p>"This is my way of being and it will lead me to interrupt my career very early because I live my work too much. And I often ask if it is right to spend so much time without my family.</p>
      <p>"During the season, sex must not last too long, we must do as little effort as possible. So stay under the partner.</p>

      <p>"And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Conte was placed under police protection recently after he received a bullet in the post.</p>
      <p>In response he said: “As I said in the past, I think we should try to convey positive values for those who follow us, for future generations.</p>
      <p>"I also talked about how surprised I was after returning to Italy. I don’t think it’s right to have discussions on these episodes that are negative, uneducated.</p>
      <p>"The more discussions we have on these situations, the more negative messages we send to young people who see in us people who are supposed to provide positive teachings.</p>
      <p>"The less we talk about it, the better. There are those who are doing their job and have assured me that they will give me news.” </p>
