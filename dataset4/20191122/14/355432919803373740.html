      <h1>Trump: Kellyanne Conway 'must have done some bad things' to 'crazy' husband</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:49:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Friday quipped that White House counselor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kellyanne-conwaya">Kellyanne Conway</a> "must have done some bad things" to her husband, fervent Trump critic <a href="https://thehill.com/people/george-conway">George Conway</a>, "because that guy's crazy."</p>
      <p>"Kellyanne is great but she’s married to a total whack job. I think, she must have done some number on him, Ainsley," Trump told "Fox &amp; Friends" co-host Ainsley Earhardt.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know what Kellyanne did to that guy because I don’t even know him … he’s got to be some kind of a nut job," Trump continued. "She must have done some bad things to him because that guy’s crazy."</p>
      <p>The president made the remark about the Conways after he was asked about the prospect of former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nimrata-nikki-haley">Nikki Haley</a> joining the 2020 ticket. Earhardt mentioned speculation on the subject from George Conway.</p>
      <p>Kellyanne Conway has been outspoken in support of Vice President Pence, and Trump on Friday said he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471629-trump-says-pence-will-remain-on-2020-ticket-hes-our-man-100-percent">would not change</a> his running mate.</p>
      <p>The Conways have been a frequent topic of discussion inside the Beltway as Kellyanne Conway remains one of the president's closest advisers and most visible defenders and George Conway carves out space as an anti-Trump commentator on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Kellyanne Conway has bristled at reporters who have brought up her husband, noting that she is one of the most prominent women in Washington, D.C., and questioning the need to bring up George Conway or her marriage.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/470433-kellyanne-conway-after-cnn-plays-george-conway-remarks-im-embarrassed-for-you">criticized CNN</a> during a recent appearance where the network played a clip of her husband discussing impeachment on MSNBC, accusing the network of doing it for ratings.</p>
      <p>"It's the same stuff all the time," she said. "What you just quoted is said every day by other voices but you wanted to put it in my husband's voice because you think somehow that that will help your ratings or that you're really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway."</p>
