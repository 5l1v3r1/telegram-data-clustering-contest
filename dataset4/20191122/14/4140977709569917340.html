                      <p>It is worth mentioning that Kohli had become the fastest captain to score 5,000 runs in Test matches. Both Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara stitched an impressive 94-run partnership in the third session of the match. While Pujara got out after scoring 55 (105), Kohli is batting in the middle alongside India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane.</p>
