      <h1>Surprise sale makes the Echo Dot cheaper today than it’ll be on Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:58:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Amazon announced earlier this week that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGL2N7J?tag=b0c55-20">Echo Dot</a> will drop to $22 on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, matching its lowest price ever. Well, that’s actually not true. As of right now, the Echo Dot just dropped to a new all-time low price thanks to a killer bundle deal Amazon is running for a limited time. Add three Echo Dots to your cart and use the coupon code DOT3PACK at checkout. The final price will be $64.97, which is just $21.65 a piece!</p>
