      <p>JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's troubled state-owned airline says flights will resume as normal over the weekend after it reached a deal with unions to end a week-long strike.</p>
      <p>South African Airways on Friday says it reached an agreement with the South African Cabin Crew Association and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa.</p>
      <p>The unions announced the strike shortly after the airline said it was launching a restructuring process that could affect nearly 950 employees.</p>
      <p>The unions also wanted more pay. The deal includes a 5.9% increase, lower than the 8% desired.</p>
      <p>Africa's second-largest carrier had warned that the strike "endangers the future of the airline."</p>
      <p>The airline is among debt-ridden state-owned enterprises that President Cyril Ramaphosa's government is trying to revive after widespread mismanagement and corruption under the previous administration.</p>
