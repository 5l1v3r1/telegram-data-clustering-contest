      <p>On Thursday night, Oklahoma tight end Grant Calcaterra, who has missed much of this season due to an undisclosed injury, announced his retirement from.</p>
      <p>The former Sooners star released a heartfelt video on Twitter. Calcaterra confirmed reports that he suffered a concussion last month.</p>
      <p>After dealing with the medical issue over the past few months, Calcaterra decided to walk away from the sport.</p>
      <p>“I spent countless hours visiting with OU medical professionals and specialists around the country. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that it would be best for me to step away from the game,” Calcaterra said. “This has been the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make in my life, but I haven’t been alone. I’ve been able to stay positive throughout this process with the help of my family, close friends, girlfriend, teammates, coaches and different OU staff members. I want to thank each and every one of you for being there when I needed it most.”</p>
      <p>Sooners fans and former Oklahoma players showed their support for Calcaterra. Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield sent a message to his former teammate.</p>
      <p>“Love you man…for life,” Mayfield said on Instagram.</p>
