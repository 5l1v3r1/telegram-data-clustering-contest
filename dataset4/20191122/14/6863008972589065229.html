      <p>The Ukrainian government has decided to cancel free long-term visas to Estonian citizens in response to a similar decision by Estonia regarding Ukrainians.</p>
      <p>In July 2018, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers adopted an order by which it decided to introduce free long-term visas for citizens of Estonia entering Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian-registered news outlet <a href="https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2019/11/22/7103364/">European Pravda</a>.</p>
      <p>This was a response to a similar decision by the Estonian side – to comply with the principle of reciprocity in relations between Ukraine and Estonia in the field of visa processing, the government explained.</p>
      <p>However, on November 15, 2019, the government invalidated last year's order, since the Estonian government decided in September to cancel its decision of 2010 on issuing free long-term visas for Ukrainians.</p>
      <p>The Estonian government explained it as follows: since approximately 90% of Ukrainian applicants seek a long-stay visa to work in Estonia, it is no longer justified to maintain a preferential treatment vis-à-vis Ukrainian citizens. The order entered into force on November 1.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Estonian government said that Ukraine remains an important partner for Estonia in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>The Estonian government decided to take a similar decision regarding the citizens of Belarus.</p>
