      <h1>Would Apple Leave Russia Over Device Ban?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:38:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Going into effect on July 2020, Russia just passed a law that would ban the sale of devices that don’t come pre-installed with Russian software. This obviously butts up against the integrity of iOS. Would Apple have the “courage” to leave the country if the Kremlin tried to force them to install their surveillance software? Because of course it’s for surveillance. Why else would a government meddle with device makers in this way?</p>
      <blockquote>The law will not mean devices from other countries cannot be sold with their normal software – but Russian “alternatives” will also have to be installed.<br/><br/>The legislation was passed by Russia’s lower house of parliament on Thursday. A complete list of the gadgets affected and the Russian-made software that needs to be pre-installed will be determined by the government.</blockquote>
