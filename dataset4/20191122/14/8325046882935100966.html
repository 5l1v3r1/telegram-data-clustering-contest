      <p>Ray Dalio’s hedge fund has placed a wager of more than $1 billion that stocks around the world will decline by March, according to a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;amp;isjs=1&amp;amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbillionaire-ray-dalio-3-reasons-the-world-has-gone-mad-2019-11&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fworld-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio%2F&amp;amp;xguid=01DD353SJ63GJY5J24C8GFC2BB&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xtz=300&amp;amp;xuuid=789fa7870e88b5851458f9596304d84c">Wall Street Journal</a> report citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Bridgewater Associates has built up a position of put options with the help of banks such as <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/gs-stock">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ms-stock">Morgan Stanley</a> that could generate returns if the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;amp;p_500">S&amp;P 500</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/dj_eurostoxx">Euro Stoxx 50</a> – or both – fall during the period, the WSJ found.</p>
      <p>Put options are contracts that grant investors the right to sell stocks at a predetermined price by a specific date.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Bridgewater’s put options will expire in March 2020 and the firm shelled out about $1.5 billion for the contracts, which are linked to about $100 billion worth of the two stock indexes.</p>
      <p>Its unclear why Bridgewater built up the position, the WSJ reported, citing multiple clients that said it could be the firm hedging against its exposure to the equity market.</p>
      <p>The magnitude of the bet has raised the price of some options, the WSJ found. The amount of S&amp;P 500 put options outstanding has also increased to a four-year high, according to data from Trade Alert cited by the WSJ.</p>

      <p>The news also comes as markets have charged to <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-sp-500-dow-nasdaq-post-record-highs-2019-11-1028694022">all-time highs</a> in recent weeks amid ongoing negotiations in the US-China trade war and lingering worries of a global slowdown.</p>
      <p>Further, Wall Street titans such as Leon Cooperman and Paul Tudor Jones have <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/roundup-of-elizabeth-warren-criticism-from-wall-street-finance-billionaires-2019-11-1028665836">issued warnings</a> over the last few months that an Elizabeth Warren presidency could tank stocks.</p>
      <p>Bridgewater told the WSJ that its investments change frequently and are often used as hedges for other trades, and that it “would be a mistake” to read to much into one position. The firm added that it doesn’t have positions that are meant to hedge or bet on political developments in the US.</p>
      <p>March 2020 is an important time for the Democratic primary because most of the party’s delegates will be awarded by the end of the month, the WSJ pointed out.</p>
      <p>Dalio, a billionaire investment guru, has expressed concern about the global economy several times over the last few months.</p>
      <p>In October, he said the world economy is in a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ray-dalio-warns-that-global-business-cycle-is-in-great-sag-monetary-policy-2019-10-1028610565">“great sag”</a> and that central banks might not be able to combat it due to historically low interest rates.</p>
