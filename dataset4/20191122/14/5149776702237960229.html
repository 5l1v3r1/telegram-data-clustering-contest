      <h1>Staff at University of Nottingham to strike for eight days</h1>
      <h2>The disputes are over pay, working conditions and rising pension costs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:22:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author">Gurjeet Nanrah</a></address>
      <p>Eight days of strikes at the University of Nottingham are to go ahead, after no agreement was reached between the university and union officials.</p>
      <p>The strikes will take place from Monday, November 25 and are part of a wider action by the University and College Union (UCU) across the UK, expected to affect more than one million students at 60 universities.</p>
      <p>The disputes are still unresolved and centre on pay, working conditions, and rising pension costs.</p>
      <p>Striking staff will form picket lines at the north entrance to the University Park campus and the Jubilee campus from 8am.</p>
      <p>The announcement of when the strikes will take place <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/eight-days-strikes-announced-university-3504129">follows a ballot earlier this month where the union decided to take action</a> over the disputes.</p>
      <p>Matt Green, University of Nottingham's UCU branch president, said: "Strike action is a last resort, but universities’ refusal to deal with these key issues have left us with no alternative. It is staggering and insulting that universities have not done more to work with us to try and find a way to resolve these disputes. "</p>
      <p>80 percent of union members at the University of Nottingham voted in favour of strikes over changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme - a private pension scheme for universities - and 75 percent backed strikes over pay and conditions.</p>
      <p>UCU says the changes to the pension scheme mean "a typical member will pay around £40,000 more in to their pension, but receive almost £200,000 less in retirement."</p>
      <p>It has also said the university had failed to make improvements on pay, equality and workloads.</p>
      <p>Some union members will also begin “action short of a strike” from Monday. This includes action such as working strictly to contract, not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">lectures</a> lost to strike action.</p>
      <p>Dr Paul Greatrix, Registrar at The University of Nottingham, said: “The University will be open and we are doing everything possible to minimise disruption for our students. The majority of teaching is proceeding and students should assume that classes will take place unless notified otherwise.</p>
      <p>“We are very sorry for any disruption that may be experienced by students and will work hard to recover any lost teaching, provide learning resources, extend deadlines where helpful, and ensure that assessments reflect the learning that has taken place.”</p>
