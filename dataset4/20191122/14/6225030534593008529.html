      <p>When Gulfstream Park opens for its Championship Meet next Friday, guests will be greeted by a $20 million modernization of the legendary venue.</p>
      <p>These significant improvements continue The Stronach Group’s commitment to keeping Gulfstream one of South Florida’s premier entertainment destinations.</p>
      <p>While not all elements will be completed by opening day, the remodeled and renovated Gulfstream will include:</p>
      <p>• A new open-air Dining Terrace on the second floor overlooking the racetrack featuring luxury boxes with private televisions and a lounge section, both offering food and beverage service from Ten Palms;</p>
      <p>• A new infield tote board measuring 100 feet by 30 feet boasting a high-density pixel LED screen;</p>
      <p>• Enhanced sound system on the apron and grandstand areas, additional LED screens and televisions throughout the buildings for a more convenient viewing experience;</p>
      <p>• Additional dining tables around the walking ring with food service offered from Char #3, a barbeque smokehouse, or Tito’s Raw Bar.</p>
      <p>This modernization comes just one year after launching The Flamingo Room on Gulfstream’s third floor. The Flamingo Room is a multi-use space offering sushi, flatbreads, and stunning views of the racetrack.</p>
      <p>“We believe these new additions and the modernizing of Gulfstream Park will elevate the experience of our guests whether they’re attending the races, the casino, our poker room, the Village at Gulfstream Park, or our new concert series,” said Joe Lopez, Vice President of Hospitality and Venue Management at Gulfstream Park. “The experience of attending a sports or entertainment event has vastly changed in the past 10 years. Fans expect new technology, a variety of seating and dining options, and unique VIP experiences. The Stronach Group continues to lead the way in reimagining the Thoroughbred racing experience as well as other unique entertainment events we will have at Gulfstream Park.</p>
      <p>“Due to the extent of this project, we will be in the process of completing work when our Championship Meet opens. But management, staff and our customer service representatives will do all we can to make your visit an enjoyable experience.”</p>
      <p>Gulfstream’s Championship Meet, featuring 98 stakes races, including 39 graded, will be highlighted by the $16 million Pegasus World Cup Championship Invitational Series, $1 million Florida Derby (G1), the Clasico Internacional del Caribe, Claiming Crown, Holy Bull (G2) and Fountain of Youth (G2).</p>
