      <h2>Our betting preview for Crystal Palace v Liverpool asks if we'll see a new man on penalty-taking duties?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:46:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/david-prentice/" target="_blank">David Prentice</a></address>
      <p>To paraphrase a real Liverpool legend, the man who was never going to be legendary at Anfield would "just love it" if his Crystal Palace side could upset Jurgen Klopp's juggernaut.</p>
      <p>But can Roy Hodgson's side cause an upset?</p>
      <p>We asked our Liverpool correspondent <b>Paul Gorst</b> for his verdict.</p>
      <h3>Win, lose or draw?</h3>
      <p>Tough one, this. Selhurst Park feels like an easy place to come unstuck, but Liverpool haven't lost there under Jurgen Klopp. In fact, the Reds have won all four games there under the German. I think the Premier League leaders will come away with the points here. Thepools.com make the away win <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">4/9</a> </b>.</p>
      <h3>Who's a good bet for 1st scorer?</h3>
      <p>Mo Salah remains an injury doubt with that troublesome ankle so I'm going to plump for Sadio Mane. The Senegal star has nine this season and I fancy him to pick up where he left off against Manchester City before the international break. He's <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">7/2</a> </b>to score first and <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">11/10</a> </b>to celebrate a goal at any time in the match.</p>
      <h3>Who's on pens?</h3>
      <p>If Salah falls short in his fitness race and James Milner doesn't start then it could be anyone's guess. Roberto Firmino? Why not! You'll get <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">17/4</a> </b>on him scoring first in London.</p>
      <h3>Will Liverpool keep a clean sheet?</h3>
      <p>Clean sheets have evaded Liverpool fairly successfully so far this season. Only Burnley and Sheffield United have failed to score against them in the Premier League. I fancy the Reds to add Palace to that list this weekend, however. A 'No' in the Both Teams To Score box is <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/4139793/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">17/20</a> </b>.</p>
      <h3>Yellow card?</h3>
      <p>No player in the Premier League has had more cautions than Luka Milivojevic's half-dozen this season. He's a good bet from a Palace perspective. Fabinho is your safest option from Liverpool's.</p>
