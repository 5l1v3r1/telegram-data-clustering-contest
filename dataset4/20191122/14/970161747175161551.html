      <p>Stanley Johnson reached out to former I’m A Celebrity campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rebekah-vardy/">Rebekah Vardy</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-fellow-wag-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-elaborate-plan-expose-10887652/"> over her feud with Coleen Rooney</a>.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson’s dad and Jamie Vardy’s wife became close back in 2017 when they headed to the Australian jungle together for the ITV series.</p>
      <p>And, during a stint on Loose Women, the 79-year-old explained he sent her a sweet message to make sure she was okay, after Wayne Rooney’s wife shared a bombshell post accusing her of leaking stories to the press – something she firmly denied.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Speaking to the panel about the drama, he said: ‘I sent her a WhatsApp, she sent me such a nice WhatsApp back.</p>
      <p>‘I said to Becky, “Look, I don’t at all understand, but I just want you to know that we’re all rooting for you”.</p>
      <p>‘This lady is about to have a baby, and that baby is going to be a wonderful thing for Becky to have.’</p>

      <p>When asked whether the mum-of-four replied, Stanley continued: ‘[She said], “Thank you so much for your lovely, lovely message.”’</p>
      <p>Stanley also let slip that the I’m A Celeb class of 2017 are in a group chat together – and we desperately want in.</p>
      <p>‘There is actually a WhatsApp group,’ he added. ‘And I don’t want to give away state secrets, but it’s called the Bush Tucker group’.</p>

      <p>Becky has had a tough few months, after finding herself engaged in an almighty feud with Coleen Rooney that basically broke the internet.</p>
      <p>It all kicked off when the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-hinted-10-months-ago-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-10888481/">mum-of-four shared a bombshell post on Instagram last month</a>, accusing her pal of leaking stories about her to the press.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In Coleen’s upload, which quickly went viral, she detailed how she planted fake posts on her private social media page – which were only viewable by Becky – in a bid to find out who had been selling the information.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/rebekah-vardy-slams-coleen-rooneys-claims-selling-stories-suggests-instagram-hacked-10887883/">Becky fiercely denied she was the person behind the leak</a>, and hired a forensic expert to get to the bottom of the accusations.</p>
