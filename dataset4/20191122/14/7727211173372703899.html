      <h1>The heartwarming way you can keep Wirral looking festive at Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Dedicate a bauble to someone 'loved or lost' and help fund Liscard's town centre Christmas lights.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:51:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/natasha-young/" target="_blank">Natasha Young</a></address>
      <p>A campaign, now in its third year, has been launched to collect baubles for the Christmas tree in Liscard’s Cherry Tree Shopping Centre, which will be decorated on December 1.</p>
      <p>Visitors are invited to hand in a bauble at the centre in the name of someone ‘loved or lost’ as part of the campaign, along with a £1 donation</p>
      <p>The bauble will be added to the centre’s towering tree, and the money raised will contribute to the Liscard Loves Lights fund which keeps the town centre lights sparkling throughout the festive season.</p>
      <p>Representatives of Love Liscard - a partnership between Wirral Chamber of Commerce and Wirral Council to support local businesses, community organisations and residents - are on hand to collect the donations and baubles.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can submit their baubles ahead of the decorating date, and can also request for baubles handed in during previous years to be added to the tree again.</p>
      <p>There are a number of opportunities in the run up to December which will make it easy to pay tribute to someone special with a bauble and be a part of this year’s festivities.</p>
      <p>According to John White, centre manager at Cherry Tree Shopping Centre, the money raised through the successful campaign in previous years has played an important part in Liscard’s Christmas celebrations.</p>
      <p>He said: “The campaign makes a great difference to the ability for the town centre to look festive for all Liscard’s shoppers throughout the Christmas period.”</p>

      <h3>Donating your bauble is easy</h3>
      <p>Simply take your bauble and £1 donation to the centre office at Cherry Tree Shopping Centre, or get in touch with the team via the Liscard Christmas Tree Facebook page to hang a bauble you’ve submitted in a previous year.</p>
      <h3>More time to dedicate your decoration</h3>
      <p>Thursday, November 28 will mark the start of Liscard’s late night shopping for the countdown to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Every Thursday, visitors will be able to shop until 7pm and the first late night shopping evening is taking place days before the tree is decorated, making it the perfect opportunity to drop off your baubles and donations.</p>
