      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare update adds more Spec Ops missions and multiplayer modes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:22:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p>A chunky update for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> is out today, introducing new Special Operations, along with a Classic Spec Ops mission, more multiplayer modes, and assorted tweaks and bug fixes. </p>
      <p>The new Spec Ops missions are Harbinger and Brimstone, while the Classic Spec Ops roster gets the Door Kick mission. Also new to Classic Spec Ops is a rating system based on how long it took you to finish the mission, along with accompanying rewards. These are XP and MP unlocks and are determined by your star rating. </p>
      <p>In multiplayer, there's a new playlist, Realism Moshpit, which includes Domination, Hardpoint, Headquarters and Kill Confirmed. Gun Game, the free-for-all mode where players get new weapons as they get more kills, is also returning. It wasn't introduced until Black Ops, but it's shown up in every game since, including Modern Warfare Remastered.</p>
      <p>The update also includes some tweaks to weapons, the infantry assault vehicle and perks, like fixing Spotter, which wasn't marking certain things in FFA. Other notable changes include the ability to see through smoke with thermal scopes and being able to disable the spawn camera in private matches.
