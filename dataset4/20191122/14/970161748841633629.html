        <b>PewDiePie has had one of the most bizarre reactions to The Mandalorian’s Baby Yoda, insisting he wants to ‘eat’ him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each to their own.</p>
      <p>The YouTube star reacted to the adorable <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> character in a recent video and things escalated quickly.</p>
      <p>‘Baby Yoda was announced and oh my god, he’s so cute!’ the 30-year-old said.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not going to lie gamers, I’ll eat Baby Yoda. I will – listen, there’s a stigma against eating Baby Yodas and I for one am happy to break it. I’ll happily be the first one to eat a Baby Yoda.’</p>
      <p>Felix added: ‘Everyone be like, “Oh, Baby Yoda’s so cute”, I’ll be like “Does it taste good, question mark?”‘</p>

      <p>Seemingly backtracking, he said: ‘Obviously come on, I wouldn’t eat a Baby Yoda,’ before quipping: ‘Unless it was cooked first. Properly. Marinated.’</p>

      <p>Alrighty then.</p>
      <p>While the YouTube star – real name Felix Kjellberg – wasn’t too impressed with the character, it’s been melting hearts elsewhere, especially with the release of the concept art.</p>
      <p>Disney Plus <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/mandalorian-introduces-baby-yoda-star-wars-fans-obviously-internet-cannot-handle-11089019/">floored subscribers when they wrapped up episode one of their sci-fi epic</a> with the first look at a tiny green creature resembling Luke Skywalker’s ancient mentor.</p>
      <p>Turns out, the baby – who is actually 50 years old – will be an integral part of The Mandalorian.</p>
      <p>Can’t wait.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, although there has been debate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/totally-fine-call-mandalorians-baby-yoda-baby-yoda-11193998/">about whether Baby Yoda is actually an appropriate name for the little one</a>, The Mandalorian director Dave Filoni has settled the debate once and for all.</p>
      <p>Yep, he’s given us all the green light to continue using the nickname for the character. ‘That’s fine, all part of the mystery,’ Filoni enthused. He then added to ET reporter Ash Crossan: ‘But it’s very clear, it’s very clear.’</p>
      <p>However, UK fans are going to have a while to wait <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/much-will-disney-plus-cost-available-uk-11067545/">until Disney+ launches in the UK in March 2020.</a></p>
      <p>It’s not all bad news though, as co-director Jon Favreau has already confirmed that season two has started filming.</p>
      <p>That’s assuming PewDiePie doesn’t eat Baby Yoda in the meantime.</p>
