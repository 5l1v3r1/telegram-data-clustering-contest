      <h1>Statistics Canada says retail sales fell 0.1 per cent in September</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:19:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>OTTAWA -- Retail sales fell 0.1 per cent in September to $51.6 billion, weighed down by lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations, <a href="http://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191122/dq191122a-eng.htm">Statistics Canada said </a>Friday.</p>
      <p>The result matched the expectations of economists, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>"All told, the Canadian consumer continues to look a bit tired, and the broader economy remains on pace for slightly below potential growth in the near term," said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at the Bank of Montreal.</p>
      <p>The overall decline came as sales in the motor vehicle and parts dealers subsector fell one per cent due to a 1.9 per cent drop at new car dealers. Sales at gasoline stations fell 2.3 per cent, due in part to lower prices.</p>
      <p>Statistics Canada says excluding these two subsectors, retail sales rose 0.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>"The ongoing strength in Canadian labour markets, the recent momentum in housing markets and wages, and the downshift in borrowing rates may have provided a modest lift to consumer spending," TD Bank economist Omar Abdelrahman wrote in a report.</p>
      <p>"Still, elevated household debt levels and associated debt-servicing costs will continue to cap any meaningful acceleration in retail sales or consumer spending.</p>
      <p>Sales at food and beverage stores rose 1.2 per cent, boosted by a 1.1 per cent increase at supermarkets and other grocery stores and a 3.2 per cent increase at beer, wine and liquor stores. Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers saw sales rise 3.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>Overall retail sales in volume terms fell 0.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>The retail sales figures come ahead of wholesale trade results for September to be released on Monday and a reading of gross domestic product for both September and the third quarter as a whole out on Nov. 29.</p>
      <p>The Canadian economy set a blistering pace in the second quarter, but economists expect growth slowed in the third quarter amid evidence of a slowing global economy, hurt by the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
