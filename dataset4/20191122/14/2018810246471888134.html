      <p>It's hot, sticky and a fairly unpleasant time to be outside, courtesy of the absolutely-not-climate-change-empowered bushfires ravaging the eastern states. Fortunately, it's a perfect time to play some video games.</p>
      <p>The back catalogue has grown supremely quickly, and that's not factoring in things that I've been meaning to finish already. Progress in <i>Death Stranding</i> has been slow — everything in that game is slow — and it's also been keeping me away from the game that I really want to spend more time in, which is <i>Disco Elysium</i>. <i>Disco Elysium</i>'s probably going to be one of my top five games of the year, if not top three. It's seriously that well done.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, I've found myself playing a bit of <i>Mobile Legends Bang Bang</i>, a very cartoony MOBA that actually has Australian servers. I've always enjoyed <i>Arena of Valor</i> on mobile, and the presentation around it and controls are really good, but <i>AoV</i> doesn't have local servers. Playing on 150ms is a bit shit compared to 50ms or under, so I've given <i>Mobile Legends</i> a whirl. The latter is also a much faster game, and I've enjoyed knocking it out on a particular phone that's especially built for gaming, which you'll hear more about next week.</p>
      <p>And if that wasn't enough, there's board games I need to write about, a <i>Modern Warfare</i> campaign that needs finishing, and the occasional bit of <i>Overwatch</i> with friends. I also fired up <i>observer</i> the other day on PC, having already bought it on Switch (and drunkenly played some on PS4), and that's been an interesting experience. Oh and I nearly forgot: SNK has an all-in-one fighting stick that doubles as a console with 20 games, which we've got sitting in the office.</p>
      <p>So plenty of games to play/write about. What are you playing this weekend?</p>
