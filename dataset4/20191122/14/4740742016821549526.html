      <p>After a harmonious start to this year's series of I'm A Celebrity, a massive fight has now broken out.</p>
      <p>The camp descended into madness when two camp mates, Jacqueline Jossa and Nadine Coyle refused to be sent to the Jungle Jailhouse, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celebrity-fight-erupts-among-20932399">The Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>After achieving eight stars in their Bushtucker Trial, new campmates Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment became outlaws and were sent to the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>The main camp had the opportunity to be "good, bad or downright ugly" - and either keep all the food themselves, or choose to feed the outlaws with their share of food.</p>
      <p>The twist with the second option was that two campmates would have to join the outlaws in the jailhouse - but tempers flared over a difference in opinion.</p>

      <p>Andrew Maxwell and James Haskell both agreed they were happy to go to the jailhouse, while Kate Garraway and Ian Wright also said they would sacrifice themselves.</p>

      <p>Former footballer Ian suggested they should draw straws, so the group picked out named water bottles to decide who would go.</p>
      <p>However, Jacqueline said it was "scary" and admitted she did not want to leave the main camp.</p>

      <p>Kate asked if she would rather not go, while Ian said she didn't have to, but Jacqueline confessed: "Yeah but it’s not very heroic."</p>

      <p>Comedian Andrew Maxwell did not see the funny side and insisted everyone should be in the hat.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out."</p>

      <p>Rugby star James said Jacqueline should not be forced to go, but Andrew argued: "It’s an ordeal that has to be shared."</p>
      <p>Andrew turned to the former EastEnders star and said: "It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything."</p>
      <p>Giving her opinion, Adele Roberts added: "I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it. If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed."</p>

      <p>Tensions quickly began to rise in camp as Jacqueline and Nadine both expressed they did not want to take part and would prefer to remain in Main Camp.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Andrew said: "Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and erm…that’s the end of that…"</p>
      <p>The comedian could not understand why Nadine and Jacqueline wouldn’t put themselves up like everyone else.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the campmates picked their named water bottles out of a bag and it was decided that Kate and Andrew would go to the Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>But that was not the end of the drama, as Jacqueline said James didn't mind going if Kate wanted to stay.</p>
      <p>However, they all agreed to stick to the original plan so Kate and Andrew left camp to join Andy and Cliff at the Jungle Jailhouse. Caitlyn asked the rest of the campmates if they knew who Andy or Cliff were, so Roman Kemp explained who Kirk from Coronation Street was.</p>
