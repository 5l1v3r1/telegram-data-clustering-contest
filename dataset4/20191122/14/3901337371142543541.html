      <p>Therefore, his choice of vehicle comes as a bit of a surprise. ‘Rama G’ opted for the stunning Range Rover Evoque, joining the likes of George Lebese and Mthokozisi Dube, who both drive the SUV.</p>
      <p>The Limpopo-born striker opted for a red version of the car and pimped it out with a cool red interior to match. </p>
