      <p>This week’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-will-ferrell-beck-bennett-promo.html"><i>SNL </i>host Will Ferrell</a> caught up with his old<i> </i>co-worker Jimmy Fallon on last night’s <i>Tonight Show, </i>so naturally, their conversation turned to the one sketch they both get recognized for the most: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/snl-chris-kattan-jimmy-fallon-more-cowbell.html">“More Cowbell” with then-host Christopher Walken</a>. First, Ferrell addressed a key aspect of the sketch: “You know, you maintain that between dress rehearsal and air, that I went and put a tighter shirt on. I thought I just put a little more mustard into it and then it hiked up.” But even more important, Ferrell tells Fallon that years after the sketch, he went to see a play Christopher Walken was in, and after he said hello to him backstage, Walken broke some big news to him. “You know, you’ve ruined my life. People — during the curtain call — bring cowbells and ring them. The other day I went for an Italian-food lunch, and the waiter asked if I wanted more cowbell with my pasta bolognese,” Ferrell says Walken told him. “From <i>The Deer Hunter</i> to <i>Pulp Fiction</i> to ‘More Cowbell,’ that’s all he gets now.” Honestly, that’s a pretty impressive legacy.</p>
