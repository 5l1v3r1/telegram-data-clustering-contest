      <h1>Raptors’ Kyle Lowry, Serge Ibaka nearing return from injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:08:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/steven-loung/" target="_blank">Steven Loung</a></address>
      <p>TORONTO – Injured <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> Kyle Lowry and <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/serge-ibaka/456450">Serge Ibaka</a> could be nearing a return.</p>
      <p>Providing an update after practice on Friday, Raptors coach Nick Nurse said that the team is "shooting for" a Dec. 1 return for Lowry when the Raptors are scheduled to face the Utah Jazz at Scotiabank Arena.</p>
      <p>Ibaka has a slight chance to be back in the lineup as early as this Saturday as he’s travelling with the team to Atlanta and is listed as "doubtful."</p>
      <p>There are reasons for optimism in regards to an earlier-than-expected Ibaka return though as the Raptors forward was seen splashing jumpers after practice.</p>
      <p>Both Lowry and Ibaka have missed Toronto’s last six games after they both got hurt in a Nov. 8 game against the New Orleans Pelicans that saw Lowry leave the contest with a thumb injury and Ibaka with a right ankle sprain.</p>
      <p>This season, Lowry is averaging 21.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.3 rebounds while shooting 42.6 per cent from three-point range. Ibaka, on the other hand, is putting up averages of 14.0 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.3 blocks while shooting 52.4 per cent from the floor.</p>
      <p>In other Raptors injury news, Patrick McCaw, who has missed the club’s last nine games with a left knee issue appears to be making good progress recovering from the surgical procedure he underwent on Nov. 6 to repair the knee.</p>
      <p>"Pretty good news on him," said Nurse of McCaw. "No matter what, he’s four weeks out from the surgery. They’ve got to let some tissue and stuff heel, but I did talk to [Raptors vice president, player health and performance] Alex [McKechnie] this morning and he said he’s really happy. He said he’s pain free already. He said he’s moving pretty well already. It’s a tissue-healing issue that just takes some time before we can really cut him loose."</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Raptors announced that rookie centre Dewan Hernandez has suffered a right thumb sprain and will miss Saturday’s contest against the Hawks in addition to Lowry, McCaw and the sparsely-used Stanley Johnson, who is dealing with a stress reaction in his groin.</p>
