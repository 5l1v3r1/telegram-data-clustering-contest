      <p>Attention, fans of sweet drinks and creamy nightcaps: You can now buy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/baileys-just-released-red-velvet-liqueur-10942850/">Red Velvet flavoured Baileys here</a> in the UK, so get your cash out immediately.</p>
      <p>Baileys first launched its Red Velvet flavour in Autumn, but it was only available in the US.</p>
      <p>But now, you can buy it across the pond in the UK, too.</p>
      <p>The creamy beverage has been made in collaboration with US brand Georgetown Cupcake, and apparently tastes just like the red chocolate cake.</p>
      <p>But don’t worry – it’s said to be not ‘too sweet’ and has ‘cocoa running through it to provide a slight but irresistible richness’.</p>
      <p>Yum.</p>
      <p>The Red Velvet Baileys comes in a 750ml bottle and has an alcohol volume of 17%.</p>
      <p>Sadly, you won’t be able to nip out to your local Tesco to grab a bottle today – as it’s not available in any supermarkets just yet.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But, you can pre-order it online through <a href="https://www.thebottleclub.com/products/baileys-red-velvet-irish-cream-liqueur-70-cl">The Bottle Club for £17.99.</a></p>

      <p>All orders will be shipped on Friday 27 December, so you’ll have a bottle in time for New Year.</p>
      <p>What could be better than celebrating a new decade with a Red Velvet Baileys?</p>
      <p>Well, maybe an actual chunk of Red Velvet cake on the side.</p>
      <p>If you can’t wait until New Year and you’re desperate to try a unique Baileys flavour, you could head over to Asda, where you’ll be able to buy the Pumpkin Spice flavour.</p>
      <p>The limited edition drink features hints of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg, and is perfect served over ice or mixed up in a pumpkin spice latte.</p>
      <p>You could even chuck it in a blender with some milk and ice cream and have a Baileys Pumpkin Spice milkshake. Mmm.</p>
