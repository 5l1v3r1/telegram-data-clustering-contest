      <p>Things break, and even in this disposable world, there's a need to fix them. Up until recently, that's been the crusty bottle of glue in your junk drawer, which is just as liable to coat your fingers as the thing you actually want to repair.</p>
      <p>Looks like there's finally a Star Trek-level solution on the market: The <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/bondic-starter-kit?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bondic-starter-kit&amp;utm_term=scsf-353464&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MzDX&amp;scsonar=1">BONDIC® Pocket 3D Liquid Plastic Welding Kit</a>.</p>
      <p>The term "welding kit" isn't just puffery, either. The BONDIC® tube puts out not glue but a liquid plastic that stays fluid for as long as you need it to. As soon as you've made a seal, just hit it with the UV light that accompanies the applicator. Instantly, the light breaks down the liquid solution and within seconds, you've got a seal of firm plastic that holds as well or better than household glue that's been drying overnight. You can even file or shave it down to fit whatever shape you need.</p>
      <p>The BONDIC® Pocket 3D Liquid Plastic Welding Kit is already <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/bondic-starter-kit?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bondic-starter-kit&amp;utm_term=scsf-353464&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MzDX&amp;scsonar=1">40% off the MSRP</a>, but you can take an extra 15% off that final price by using the early Black Friday code <b>BFSAVE15, </b>lowering the final cost to only $12.74.</p>
