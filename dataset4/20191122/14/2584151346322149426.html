      <p>LONDON — Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party has put immigration back on the political agenda by pledging to cut the number of migrants moving to the U.K. to just 50,000.</p>
      <p>Launching the party’s policy platform in central London Friday, Farage accused the Conservatives and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-labours-manifesto-explained/">the Labour Party</a> of giving in to the pressure of business. Firms argue they may struggle to recruit skilled workers if migration is reduced.</p>
      <p>Farage claimed the U.K. has a “population crisis directly as a result of policies since the late 1990s,” and said it is time for the election campaign to focus on how to cut the numbers of migrants.</p>
      <p>“We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels, and, yes, I’m talking around about 50,000 people a year,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party is proposing to introduce a “fair points system,” which would be blind to ethnic origin and take into account wage stagnation and the skills gap.</p>
      <p>An estimated 283,000 more people moved to the U.K. with the intention of staying 12 months or more than left the country in the year ending September 2018, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.</p>
      <p>In previous elections, the Conservatives promised to bring net migration down to “the tens of thousands” but failed to deliver on their manifesto pledge.</p>
      <p>Pitching himself as the “leader of the new radicals,” Farage said Brexit should be the beginning of a much deeper “political revolution that puts the ordinary people first.”</p>
      <p>Farage promised to start a debate during the election campaign about the U.K.’s role in the Five Eyes security alliance and the “willful dangers that NATO faces” — in a reference to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macrons-transatlantic-turbulence/">Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of NATO</a>.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party does not have aspirations of forming the next government but hopes to erode the Labour vote in the north of England and Wales and put pressure on Boris Johnson's Conservatives to deliver a Brexit they are happy with.</p>
      <p>In its <a href="https://www.thebrexitparty.org/contract-with-the-people/">policy document</a>, the party says it can raise £200 billion by scrapping the High Speed 2 railway project, keeping the £13 billion a year of EU contributions, recovering the U.K.’s £7 billion payments into the European Investment Bank, and halving the aid budget. Party officials claim these savings would enable them to be “budget neutral.”</p>
      <p>This money would be used to pay for a number of policies likely to play well in Leave-supporting regions, such as expanding local road and rail schemes, offering free broadband in deprived communities and free WiFi on all public transport, investing in the National Health Service, scrapping interest on student loans, and spending £2.5 billion on fishing and coastal communities.</p>
      <p>“Freed from EU rules on state aid,” the Brexit Party would invest in “strategic industries” such as steel, railways and defense “to create thousands of jobs,” their policy document says.</p>
      <p>On taxation, the Brexit Party promises to cut VAT on domestic fuel bills, replace business rates “with a simpler system to assist” small retailers, reform Corporation Tax, and abolish Inheritance Tax. Strategic sectors such as the automotive industry would receive transitional tax relief “to ensure a smooth Brexit,” the policy document says.</p>
      <p>Farage also called for a written constitution, the abolition of the House of Lords, an overhaul of the postal voting system, and the introduction of Citizens’ Initiatives to allow people to call referenda when a minimum of 5 million registered voters have signed a petition.</p>
