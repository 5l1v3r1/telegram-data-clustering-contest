      <h1>Trump: Kellyanne must have done 'bad things' to George Conway to make him 'crazy'</h1>

      <p>President Trump slammed George Conway during an appearance on <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i>, saying he thinks Kellyanne Conway must have done "bad things" to him to make him a "nut job."</p>
      <p>"First of all, Kellyanne is great, but she's married to a total whack job," Trump said during the Friday interview. "She must have done some number on him, Ainsley. I don’t know what Kellyanne did to that guy. I don’t even know him. I met him for a second. He's got to be some kind of a nut job. She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy."</p>
      <p>George has had a high-profile vendetta against Trump, publicly criticizing him despite his wife's position in the administration. Last week, sources close to George said that he has grown further apart from Kellyanne and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/shes-in-a-cult-george-conway-can-make-marriage-work-if-kellyanne-leaves-white-house">believes she is in a "cult."</a></p>
      <p>"It's not going to get better until she's cast out of the cult," the source said. A source also said that George wants their marriage to work, but she would need to leave the White House.</p>
      <p>George, an attorney, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-dont-frankly-want-to-be-on-television-george-conway-makes-rare-tv-appearance-for-impeachment-hearings">recently went on MSNBC</a> to talk about the beginning of the public impeachment hearings held by the House Intelligence Committee. Kellyanne criticized the move, saying the cable networks were <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/im-embarrassed-for-you-kellyanne-conway-steams-after-clip-of-husbands-msnbc-commentary-played">trying to use her husband</a> as a weapon against her.</p>
