      <p>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says every manager would want his job but he feels no extra pressure in the English Premier League (<a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">EPL</a>) after Mauricio Pochettino became available following his sacking by Tottenham Hotspur, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, who was <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/19/epl-tottenham-sack-manager-pochettino/">sacked by Spurs on Tuesday</a> and <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoints-jose-mourinho-as-head-coach/">replaced by former United manager Jose Mourinho</a>, was linked with the Old Trafford job by British media following the Portuguese’s departure last season.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer, however, was eventually given the job on a permanent basis in March after impressing in an interim role.</p>
      <p>United have struggled for consistency under Solskjaer this season with the club seventh in the table having collected 16 points from 12 matches but the 46-year-old said he was not worried about his job or Pochettino’s availability.</p>
      <p>“It does not bother me at all. I have got the best job in the world.</p>
      <p>“If you are in a job, or if you are out of a job and you are a manager, you want this job. It does not matter whatever happens around. I have got to focus on my job and do it as well as I can.</p>
      <p>“I speak with (executive vice-chairman) Ed Woodward and the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward. That does not change if some other clubs change their managers,” Solskjaer told a news conference ahead of Sunday’s trip to Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>United will be without midfielders Scott McTominay and Paul Pogba for the match against the fifth-placed Blades as the duo continue their recovery from ankle injuries.</p>
      <p>“Scott will be out for a little while, still. He’s not been training with us… hopefully, we can see him around the time of Tottenham or Manchester City next month.</p>
      <p>“(Pogba) had another test and a scan at the start of the international break and he’s not healed yet. But he’s stepping up his recovery and he’s out of a cast.</p>
      <p>“He was in one for six or seven weeks. You do lose loads of muscle so he’s gradually stepping up walking on the treadmill, biking with a free ankle. It will still be a few weeks. We hope to see him in 2019,” Solskjaer said.</p>
