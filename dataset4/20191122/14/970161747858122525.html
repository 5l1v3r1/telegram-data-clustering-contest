      <p>Warning: major spoilers ahead for the finale of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.</p>
      <p>The Vivienne is Drag Race royalty, now that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/drag-race-uk-winner-rupaul-vivienne-baga-chipz-divina-dicampo-11197257/">she’s won the first ever series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.</a></p>
      <p>So it makes sense that Drag Race royalty is coming to her wedding.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is tying the knot with boyfriend David next month – a pretty good few weeks for The Viv – and the deed will be done by none other than Chad Michaels.</p>
      <p>The season four legend and All Stars champion will be performing the ceremony as Cher, and we hope that the lyrics to The Shoop Shoop Song are incorporated into the vows.</p>

      <p>When asked who was performing at her wedding, The Vivienne told Metro.co.uk: ‘Chad Michaels. A little bit of Cher. He’s my absolute favourite Drag Race queen, him and Bianca [Del Rio]. I think he’s going to marry us as Cher and perform later. A camp old affair.’</p>

      <p>But Viv won’t be joining Chad by dragging up for her wedding, saying: ‘Oh god, no. I couldn’t think of anything worse.’</p>
      <p>Chad will be in fine company, as some of Drag Race’s biggest stars are also on the guestlist.</p>

      <p>The Vivienne said: ‘We’re getting married on the 15th of December, so next month.</p>
      <p>‘Alan Carr’s coming, Michelle’s coming hopefully, all the production guys are coming. If Ru’s in the UK, we’ll give him a little invite.’</p>
      <p>While RuPaul could be there to watch Viv walk down the aisle, the Scouse queen admits she doesn’t have much of a relationship with the legendary host off camera.</p>

      <p>‘Ru’s a very private guy off camera, and you’ve got to remember, when he’s on set, he’s there doing a job, and that’s that,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘There’s no way I could have a relationship with Ru, I haven’t got his number or anything like that. But he was lovely on set, he was always talkative.</p>
      <p>‘If I bumped into him in the street, yeah, we’d probably have a chat. But I haven’t got his number.’</p>
