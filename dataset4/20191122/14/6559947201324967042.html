      <p> <b>$4.99</b></p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Tasty, easy-to-prepare meals. Less expensive than competing services.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Fewer exciting flavors than the competition. Limited delivery options. No vegan or vegetarian options.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>Meal-kit delivery service EveryPlate offers an excellent way to get in the habit of cooking for yourself without breaking the bank.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>When I was in my 20s, my fridge was mostly filled with beer and condiments—despite my literally living behind a grocery store. Sometimes you just don't have the mental or physical energy to seek out recipes, plan your meals, and go grocery shopping on top of all your other responsibilities. That's where <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/web-sites/89027/the-best-meal-kit-delivery-services">meal-kit delivery services</a> like EveryPlate come in. What sets Everyplate apart from its many competitors is the affordability of its service, touted at just $4.99 per meal. While that price comes with some caveats, the service really is inexpensive, and it delivers surprisingly tasty meals for the price.</p>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>That price tag comes with a couple caveats, though. First, it doesn't include shipping, which costs $8.99 per box. Second, the fewest number of two-serving meals you can get in a box is three—unlike HelloFresh and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/blue-apron/82689/review/blue-apron-meal-delivery-service">Blue Apron</a>, which allow you to go as low as two. That means each EveryPlate box ends up being about $39—a bit more than their front page advertising may imply, but still quite a bit less than the comparable $62 box from HelloFresh.</p>

      <p>EveryPlate offers boxes with three, four, or five meals per week for two people, or you can go with four servings for three meals per week. Again, that's not as many choices as <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/hellofresh/82697/review/hellofresh-meal-delivery-service">HelloFresh</a> and Blue Apron offer, so if you're cooking for a big family, one of the other services may be a better bet. There are also no vegetarian-only or low-calorie options such as all most other meal services have, and you can only choose from three weekdays—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—for delivery. I found this rather annoying, since I'd rather front-load my home-cooked meals during the week, so I can go out with friends on the weekend.</p>
      <p>Given these limitations, you can see how the company arrives at some of its cost savings. Still, if you're only looking for the typical 2-person omnivore plan, the EveryPlate experience is similar to other meal services. You sign up, select your ideal delivery day, and pick the meals for your first box. From then on, EveryPlate will preselect meals for your next box, but you can change them from the website or app at any time, and you can skip weeks where you might be out of town.</p>
      <h3>The EveryPlate Experience</h3>
      <p>When my first box shipped, EveryPlate notified me that it was on its way with a tracking link, and the box arrived on time. There was a lot of packing material included, but almost all of it was recyclable, and the ingredients were well packed with meats kept very cold at the bottom of the box. You get everything you need except staples like vegetable oil, butter, sugar, and salt, and the ingredients seem to be sourced from the same suppliers as the bigger, more expensive meal services.</p>

      <p>For my first week of meals, I chose herb butter steak, pork and yellow rice bowls, and sweet chili-glazed chicken. All the meals were fairly easy to make, even when I had to handle the bulk of preparation myself. I'm a decently experienced cook, though—if you're just starting out, it you may want to have a roommate or partner help you with the first few meals so you can get the timing down for all the moving parts.</p>

      <p>The included recipe cards are handy, and include estimated prep and cook times. You can get more information, like nutrition stats and allergens, from the EveryPlate app. I do wish some of the instructions were been a bit easier to follow. One of the recipes I tested, for example, calls for zesting a lime while you perform an unrelated task, not mentioning the lime zest again until the very end of the recipe. For the most part, however, the recipes are pretty straightforward.</p>

      <p>All three meals were delicious, though their flavors were a tad more traditional than what I've had from Blue Apron and HelloFresh. My wife and I both enjoyed our EveryPlate meals, but with Blue Apron and HelloFresh, we found ourselves saying "wow" a bit more often, due to the way they fused different seasonings and types of cuisines. This could have just been the result of the recipes available on EveryPlate that particular week, and some people may actually prefer a less experimental flavor profile in their recipes, but it was a small downside in my eyes.</p>

      <p>Canceling my account was dead simple; it takes just a few button presses on the site's Settings page. I was clearly notified when I would be charged for the next shipment, and received no unexpected charges (though choosing a premium meal, like steak, creates a separate $3-per-serving charge on your card, which is clearly disclosed during recipe selection).</p>
      <h3>Help and Extras</h3>
      <p>Beyond meal delivery, EveryPlate is a bit more barebones than its competitors. There is an FAQ on the service's website that has a lot of information telling you what you'll need to get meals prepared and how EveryPlate runs its business, but don't expect the extensive wine pairings, knife guides, and other niceties you get with more expensive services. Then again, if you don't need those things, the cost savings provided by EveryPlate can be quite enticing.</p>
      <p>Customer service is easy to contact, with both a phone number and 24/7 live chat <a href="https://www.everyplate.com/contact">available on their website</a>. Its support staff are also fairly active on social media, letting you know what recipes are coming up to whet your appetite.</p>
      <h3>Chow Down</h3>
      <p>Meal-kit delivery services can be extremely convenient, but that convenience often comes at a hefty cost. While EveryPlate isn't cheaper than buying groceries yourself, it's closer than some of the larger services, so if you're torn between your budget and your schedule, it's a great compromise. If you want more options and more exciting flavors, Editors' Choice picks Blue Apron and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/web-sites-products/88216/review/sun-basket-meal-delivery-service">Sun Basket</a> are your best bets.</p>
