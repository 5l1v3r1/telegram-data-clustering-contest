      <h1>You’re more likely to mess things up without enough sleep</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:23:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">Caroline Brooks-Michigan State</a></address>
      <p>Sleep deprivation affects us much more than prior theories have suggested, according to new research.</p>
      <p>The research is not only one of the largest studies on sleep, but also the first to assess how sleep deprivation affects placekeeping—or, the ability to complete a series of steps without losing one’s place, despite potential interruptions.</p>
      <p>“Our research showed that sleep deprivation doubles the odds of making placekeeping errors and triples the number of lapses in attention, which is startling,” Fenn says. “Sleep-deprived individuals need to exercise caution in absolutely everything that they do, and simply can’t trust that they won’t make <a href="https://www.futurity.org/mistakes-eyes-decisions-2005852/">costly errors</a>. Oftentimes—like when behind the wheel of a car—these errors can have tragic consequences.”</p>
      <p>By sharing their findings on the separate effects sleep deprivation has on cognitive function, Fenn—and coauthors Michelle Stepan, a doctoral candidate and Erik Altmann, professor of psychology—hope that people will acknowledge how significantly their abilities are hindered because of a lack of sleep.</p>
      <p>“Our findings debunk a common theory that suggests that attention is the only cognitive function affected by sleep deprivation,” says coauthor Michelle Stepan, a doctoral candidate. “Some sleep-deprived people might be able to hold it together under routine tasks, like a doctor taking a patient’s vitals. But our results suggest that completing an activity that requires following multiple steps, such as a doctor completing a medical procedure, is much riskier under conditions of sleep deprivation.”</p>
      <p>The researchers recruited 138 people to participate in the overnight sleep assessment; 77 stayed awake all night and 61 went home to sleep. All participants took two separate cognitive tasks in the evening: one that measured reaction time to a stimulus; the other measured a participant’s ability to maintain their place in a series of steps without omitting or repeating a step—even after sporadic interruptions. The participants then repeated both tasks in the morning to see how sleep-deprivation affected their performance.</p>
      <p>“After being interrupted there was a 15% error rate in the evening and we saw that the <a href="https://www.futurity.org/meditation-mistakes-brains-2207942/">error rate</a> spiked to about 30% for the sleep-deprived group the following morning,” Stepan says. “The rested participants’ morning scores were similar to the night before.</p>
      <p>“There are some tasks people can do on auto-pilot that may not be affected by a lack of sleep,” Fenn says. “However, sleep deprivation causes widespread deficits across all facets of life.”</p>
      <p>The study will appear in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000717"><i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i></a>.</p>
