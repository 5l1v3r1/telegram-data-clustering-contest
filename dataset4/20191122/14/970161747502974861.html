      <p>A woman has a phobia of cats that is so severe she can’t look at a picture of one without shuddering.</p>
      <p>Jean Diffenthal, 55, panics if she comes anywhere near a cat, and avoids the pet food aisles in case she spots a picture on tinned food.</p>
      <p>The grandmother-of-two is so afraid of kitties that she will also avoid watching certain TV programmes or adverts in case one pops up.</p>
      <p>She also pays her relatives to put their cats in a cattery when she goes home to visit.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Any time she spots a cat she ‘freaks out’ and her heart starts racing, and even the word ‘cat’ gives her the ‘heebie-jeebies’.</p>
      <p>It was a struggle for Jean to buy a house in Reading because she refused to view a property with a cat in it, or any kind of cat ornaments.</p>

      <p>She has never touched a cat, and singing any nursery rhymes mentioning the animal is totally off the table.</p>
      <p>Jean says the phobia has become worse over the years, and now makes everyday tasks difficult for her.</p>
      <p>She’s desperate to find some help to overcome her fear and live a normal life.</p>
      <p>Jean, who is currently unemployed, said: ‘I can’t be in the same room as a cat or even look at this without freaking out.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll avoid the pet aisle at the supermarket so I don’t seem imagines of cats on tinned food.</p>
      <p>‘I’m from South Africa originally and when I got home to visit family I’ll pay to put their cats in the cattery while I’m there.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got a tiny garden, but I’ve got about six cat repellents out there just in case.</p>
      <p>‘I feel my heart racing and I break out into a sweat whenever I spot one – even saying the word gives me the heebie-jeebies.</p>
      <p>‘I just tell people I’m allergic now to save time explaining the phobia because people just don’t understand it.’</p>

      <p>Jean, who is originally from Durban, South Africa, moved to Reading 16 years ago, and has had a fear of domestic house cats for as long as she can remember.</p>

      <p>She lives at home with her husband Russell and they have to plan ahead before visiting friends and family in case they have a cat.</p>
      <p>Jean has visited a hypnotherapist, but nothing has helped her overcome her fear.</p>
      <p>‘People always asked if it began because of some traumatic experience but it didn’t,’ Jean said.</p>
      <p>‘For as long as I can remember I’ve been scared of them and I have no idea why. It’s something about their eyes and they’re agility – they quietly dart about.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve never touched a cat because they look like they’re all skin and bone which freaks me out. Although it’s just domestic cats – I don’t have problem with lions or tigers.</p>
      <p>‘I think moving from South Africa to the UK has made it worse because there are so many more pet cats here.</p>
      <p>‘They’re often out roaming around and I don’t know where they’ll be hiding which terrifies me.’</p>
      <p>The phobia has become more extreme over the years and it now affects Jean’s day-to-day life.</p>

      <p>Simple tasks such as watching TV or spending time with her grandchildren, three-year-old twins Leyla and Renelan, have become a challenge.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I loved watching reality shows with my daughter Bianca but one of them had a resident cat on the show.</p>
      <p>‘I had to look away every time it was on screen and wait until it was gone and safe to look again.</p>
      <p>‘There so many adverts where they pop up and it sends my heart rate through the roof. I get sweaty when I see them and physically run away if I spot one.</p>
      <p>‘It’s also difficult for my poor husband and we have to make sure there are no cats around when we go to places together.</p>
      <p>‘Russell’s mum passed away recently but before, when I went to visit her in the care home, I had to get Russell to remove a cat picture off the wall in her room before I could go in.</p>
      <p>‘I make him ask his friends and colleagues if they have one in the house before we go.</p>
      <p>‘I ask my friends to lock them away in a different room, but on one occasion I heard one scratching at the door and I couldn’t stay.’</p>
      <p>Jean went to see a hypnotherapist five years ago to try to overcome her debilitating fear of cats.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, she found the treatment ineffective and is still hoping to find hope and overcome her fear once and for all.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>She said: ‘The therapist told me to pinch my fingers and think of something good whenever I saw a cat.</p>
      <p>‘But I couldn’t look or be near one long enough to try it. It’s really hard to talk about it because no one really understands.</p>
      <p>‘Although people are scared of things like spiders, which are tiny, so why are cats any stranger. It’s not like fearing a type of caterpillar that you seen once a month – I have to face them most days.</p>
      <p>‘I hope sharing my story with show people that’s not that unusual. It’s really affecting everything I do and I want to volunteer for elderly care but often they’ll have pet cats in the house.’</p>
