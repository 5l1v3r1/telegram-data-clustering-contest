      <h1>Iran says 'world war' against it failed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:53:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Iran's Basij militia said the nationwide unrest sparked by fuel price hikes amounted to a "world war" against the Islamic republic that had been foiled.</p>
      <p>The protests erupted across the sanctions-hit country on November 15, after the price of petrol was raised by as much as 200 percent.</p>
      <p>Authorities said leaders of the protests in which police stations were attacked, petrol pumps torched and shops looted had been arrested.</p>
      <p>"A full-fledged world war against the system and the revolution was born and fortunately the child died at the moment of birth," said Brigadier General Salar Abnoosh, a deputy head of the Basij.</p>
      <p>Quoted by semi-official news agency ISNA late Thursday, Abnoosh said interrogations had revealed a "coalition of evil" made up of "Zionists, America and Saudi Arabia" was behind the "sedition".</p>
      <p>The United Nations human rights office, for its part, has said it was alarmed by reports that live ammunition used by security forces to quell the unrest had caused a "significant number of deaths".</p>
      <p>Officials have confirmed five deaths, while Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed.</p>
      <p>The extent of the bloodshed was difficult to confirm because of internet cuts, which Abnoosh, said had helped "disrupt" efforts by Iran's foes.</p>
      <p>ISNA said internet access and connectivity via ADSL had now been partially restored in a number of provinces and for some universities in Tehran.</p>
