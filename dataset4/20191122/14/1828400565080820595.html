      <p>Now in its 10th year, the MoRun event also aims to raise awareness. There are 5k and 10k runs starting at 9.30am with entry prices ranging from £12-22.</p>
      <p>Commentator Chris Benson is encouraging people of all ages to take part and to dress as silly as possible.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a fantastic event for all abilities and ages and good fun for kids too as they can enter the [1.5k] MiniMoRun. It’s timed but not as serious as other events I’ve commentated at.</p>
      <p>“I’ve commentated at these events for years now but they’ve added Blackpool for the first time, which is nice.”</p>
      <p>Online entries are now closed, though places will be sold on a first come, first served basis on the day.</p>
      <p>Those taking part will get a medal and headband, with awards also handed out for the best fancy dress.</p>
