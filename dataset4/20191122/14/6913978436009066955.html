      <p><b>MIAMI — </b>Kim Sei-young conjured a late eagle to open up a two-shot lead after the first round of the LPGA Tour Championship in Florida on Thursday.<br/><br/>The South Korean's moment of magic came on the par-five 17th hole at Tiburon Golf Club, when she hit her approach to the edge of the green before draining a 12-foot putt for eagle.<br/><br/>A par on the 18th gave Kim a seven-under-par 65, completing a flawless bogey-free round that also included five birdies.<br/><br/>It left Kim as the early front-runner for what is the richest tournament in women's golf, where the winner will pocket a record $1.5 million.<br/><br/>Kim however said she is not thinking about the prospect of a record payday in what is the final event of 2019.<br/><br/>"Even (though) this tournament really special, I just try to make myself comfortable," Kim said when asked about the record purse.<br/><br/>"I don't put any extra pressure on myself."<br/><br/>Of more importance for Kim is the fact that a pre-season goal of winning three tournaments is still very much on track.<br/><br/>The 26-year-old from Seoul won at the Mediheal Championship in California in May before taking the Marathon Classic in Ohio in July.<br/><br/>"I set a goal at beginning of the year to win three tournaments," Kim said. "If I win this tournament I will reach my goal, which is really nice."<br/><br/>Kim can expect a stiff challenge over the final three rounds, with a crowded field of contenders lurking just off the lead.<br/><br/>Three players — Nelly Korda of the United States, England's Georgia Hall and Korea's Ryu So-yeon — carded five-under-par 67s to start.<br/><br/>Hall, who like Kim eagled the 17th, might have joined the Korean at the top of the leaderboard had it not been for a disastrous double-bogey six on the 13th.<br/><br/>Hall said she had been bothered by foot pain caused by a new pair of shoes, and needed treatment from a physio during her round.<br/><br/>"For some reason they're like really cutting into one of the bones in my foot, so I just got it taped up more than it already was," Hall said later. "Still hurting, but it's fine. I can cope with it."<br/><br/>Five players — Brooke Henderson, Lizette Salas, Caroline Masson, Marina Alex and Nanna Koerstz Madsen — are three shots off the lead after carding four-under-par 68s.<br/><br/>World No. 1 Ko Jin-Young finished the day six off the lead after a one-under-par 71. — AFP</p>
