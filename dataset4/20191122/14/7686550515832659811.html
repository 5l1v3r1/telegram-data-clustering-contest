      </figure>
      <p>The Brexit Party has released its policies ahead of the General Election 2019.</p>
      <p>But, they won't call the document a manifesto, instead it is a "contract with the people".</p>
      <p>The contract mentions Brexit 22 times in the 24 page document.</p>
      <p>The opening line is that "a clean break Brexit is the key to changing Britain for good" and it continues that "our priority is to Leave the European Union and deliver the Brexit that 17.4m voted for in 2016."</p>
      <p>It also wants "to cancel HS2, save 50% of the foreign aid budget and save another £13bn a year in payments to the EU".</p>
      <p>The party would scrap the licence fee, changing planning rules and to scrap student loan interest.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party is not standing in all Welsh constituencies. It announced earlier in November it would not stand in constituencies where the Tories won in 2017.</p>
      <p>That means in eight Welsh seats, there are no Brexit Party candidates standing, including in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/brecon-radnorshire-general-election-candidates-16891873">Brecon and Radnorshire</a> and the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/vale-glamorgan-candidates-general-election-16953444">Vale of Glamorgan.</a></p>
      <p>You can see the full list of candidates for every <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-find-my-constituency-17237856">Welsh constituency in our guide.</a></p>
      <h3>'A political revolution'</h3>
      <p>The Brexit Party says it will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reform the voting system to make it more representative</li>
        <li>Abolish the unelected House of Lords</li>
        <li>Make MPs who switch parties subject to recall petitions</li>
        <li>Overhaul the postal voting system to combat fraud and abuse</li>
        <li>Reform the Supreme Court – judges who play a role in politics must be subject to political scrutiny.</li>
        <li>Ensure political balance by broadening participation in the Selection Commission or conduct interviews by Parliamentary Committee</li>
        <li>Make the Civil Service more accountable to the public</li>
        <li>Phase out the BBC licence fee</li>
        <li>Require Universities to incorporate an obligation to protect legal free speech</li>
        <li>Introduce Citizens’ Initiatives to allow people to call referendums, subject to a 5m threshold of registered voter signatures and time limitations on repeat votes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>'The Brexit dividend'</h3>
      <p>It will raise £200bn by scrapping HS2, keeping the £13bn it claims is given annually to the EU, keep 50% of the current foreign aid budget and believes it can recover £7bn from the European Investment Bank, the lending arm of the EU.</p>

        <b>What would people get in return?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party says it would spend "at least £50bn in local road and rail schemes" and offer "free base level domestic broadband in deprived regions and free Wi-Fi on all public transport".</p>
      <p>It would invest £2.5bn in fishing and coastal communities and "plant millions of trees".</p>
      <p>"The impact of EU policies on energy prices costs us jobs and punishes the poorest in society, while the EU Customs Union prevents us cutting tariffs on non-EU imports."</p>
      <p>Based on that, it would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cut VAT on domestic fuel</li>
        <li>We will zero rate VAT on domestic fuel to reduce energy bills — saving an average £65 per household.</li>
        <li>Reduce tariffs to zero on certain foods, footwear and clothing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taxes and business</h3>
      <p><b>Business rates</b> would be ditched as would interest on <b>student loans</b> and the <b>inheritance tax.</b></p>
      <p>There would be no Corporation Tax on the first £10,000 of pre-tax profits.</p>
      <p>Subsidies and grants paid by the EU to UK businesses such as farmers, fisheries, universities and research bodies would be maintained.</p>
      <p>Money would be provided to key sectors such as the automotive industry, to ensure a smooth Brexit.</p>
      <p>Freeports would be set up in certain regions to encourage investment and create new jobs.</p>
      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>It would make a requirement to "recycle our own waste and make it illegal for it to be exported across the world to be burnt, buried or dumped at sea".</p>
      <h3>Defence, crime and immigration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The UK would continue to spend 2% of GDP as "an absolute minimum".</li>
        <li>Withdraw from the European Defence Union</li>
        <li>Crack down on illegal immigration</li>
        <li>"Reduce annual immigration and address wage stagnation and the skills gap by introducing a fair points system that is blind to ethnic origin. And always provide a humane welcome for genuine refugees".</li>
        <li>Increase police numbers</li>
        <li>Target the menace of County Lines drug dealers, gangs and the growth of knife crime</li>
        <li>Abolish targets and introduce sentence ranges for young offenders, to encourage rehabilitation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>The NHS has to remain "publicly-owned" the document says. "Your postcode should not determine your care or health".</p>
      <p>The party would scrap all targets, introduce 24 hour GP surgeries and scrap the requirement for degrees to enter nursing and midwifery.</p>
      <p>It also promises a "national debate on our NHS, involving the public alongside MPs, doctors and experts. We should discuss ring-fencing the NHS budget and the tax revenues that pay for it."</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>Student loan interest would be scrapped, as would the target for 50% of young people into higher education.</p>
      <p>The "cumbersome" Apprentice Levy would also be ditched.</p>
      <h3>Universal Credit</h3>
      <p>Universal Credit needs to be "revisited", the party says.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party says it would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support those who have paid into the system with accelerated payment processes (five-week maximum), and continue to root out fraud</li>
        <li>Undertake a 12-month review of the system and bring in reforms within two years</li>
        <li>Review the position of women unexpectedly short-changed by recent rises in the state pension age</li>
        <li>Extend the use of dormant funds to support civil society</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Housing</h3>
      <p>The party promise to simply planning to encourage small and medium-sized developers and increase the housing supply.</p>
      <p>It wants to "simplify" planning consents for brownfield sites, change funding so councils can more simply borrow from central government to build council houses. The party also says it will "allow more flexibility in the number of affordable homes within a development scheme."</p>
