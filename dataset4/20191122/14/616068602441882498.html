      <p>For the car collector out there with a taste for the classics, a West Kelowna seller has a deal for you.</p>
      <p>Described as a “magnificent beast” that “runs like a Porsche,” the seller of a harvest gold 1980 Honda Civic had some fun with the <a href="http://classifieds.castanet.net/details/1980_honda_civic_-_fast_sportscar/4019491/">listing in Castanet's classifieds</a> section.</p>
      <p>“I have to sell it because I'm being hounded by all the single moms at my kid's soccer games as well as 1974 Miss Playmate of the year who somehow discovered I was the owner of this magnificent beast,” reads the ad.</p>
      <p>The classic two-door “sports car” comes loaded with four seats and a steering wheel, along with gas, brake, and clutch pedals, all for just $1,200.</p>
      <p>“Is it fuel efficient while offering a beautiful purr that only a four-cylinder engine from the '80s can provide? Indeed.”</p>
      <p>For no extra charge, the lucky buyer will also get an interior covered in dog hair, along with “a pretty good chance it comes with a small family of squirrels who now reside in the back.”</p>
      <p>The car could be the perfect purchase for the person who loves to get their hands dirty, it requires a passenger-side mirror, a new windshield, new battery, an oil change, spark plugs, and “a little tree air freshener to hang off the rear view mirror.”</p>
      <p>“All that is negated though because it comes with a CD player to play your favourite Ace of Bass CDs with the windows down at any car show you should choose to win a gold medal in,” the ad states.</p>
      <p>While the seller doesn't know exactly how many kilometres are on the car, the ad says “let's assume 40 million.”</p>
      <p>“Good luck to the successful buyer of this prize. I will need your address and phone number upon sale so that I can get 1974 Miss Playmate to start bothering you at all hours instead of myself. She's relentless.”</p>
