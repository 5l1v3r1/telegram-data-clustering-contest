      <h1>Pep Guardiola defends Bernardo Silva following Man City star's racism ban</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City will be without Portugal international Bernardo this weekend, after he was handed a one-match FA ban related to a tweet sent to Benjamin Mendy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:26:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> claimed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bernardo-silva">Bernardo Silva</a> has been accused of being a racist and defended his player against the charge.</p>
      <p>Silva is suspended for City's game against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> tomorrow after the FA hit him with a one-match ban after he admitted a misconduct charge.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international was also fined £50,0000 and ordered to undertake an education programme.</p>
      <p>The charge related to a tweet Silva sent to City team-mate Benjamin Mendy, comparing him to a character depicted on a packet of Conguitos, a chocolate brand available in Spain and Portugal.</p>
      <p>The FA charged Silva after stating the post constituted an “aggravated breach” of its rules on social media behaviour, because it appeared to reference Mendy's race.</p>

      <p>Although Silva admitted the charge, Guardiola claimed the player had been accused of being something he is not and re-iterated his support for him.</p>
      <p>“In that situation, he’s been accused of something he’s not,” said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>“If they want to pick up someone to show something [make an example of] it was the right person.</p>
      <p>“He will be careful with social media, but if this can help make a better society then Bernardo will accept it.</p>
      <p>"But he’s not what he’s accused of.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola also spoke publicly for the first time since City forward Raheem Sterling was dropped by England boss Gareth Southgate for an altercation with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>“He’s good,” said Guardiola. “I spoke with him, he’s fine, he said Gomez is an excellent guy, they have a good relationship, it sometimes happens.”</p>
      <p>City goalkeeper Ederson, who missed the 3-1 defeat at Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> with a thigh injury, is back to face Chelsea.</p>
      <p>But City are still missing Aymeric Laporte, Leroy Sane and Alex Zinchenko.</p>
