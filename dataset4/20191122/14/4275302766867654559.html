      <p>A haul of heroin, cannabis and laundered cash is said to have been unearthed during a series of major operations in 2019.</p>
      <p>These included Operation Shoreditch, which focused on an alleged “international crime group” working in the west of Scotland said to have been involved in laundering “millions”.</p>
      <p>As part of this police initiative, drugs worth £20 million were also apparently recovered. Eleven men were arrested and charged in connection with the activities.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, as part of Operation Demolish more than 20 people from Glasgow and Lanarkshire were charged after heroin worth about £1.5 million was found.</p>
      <p>In Glasgow, Operation Track led to 46 arrests and the seizure of £280,000 in cash and drugs.</p>
      <p>It comes as <a href="https://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/our-performance/">Police Scotland’s latest management information report for the second quarter of 2019</a> reveals that 12 “serious organised crime groups” were hit by police activity in July.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Constable Fiona Taylor said: “Tackling serious organised crime remains one of our key priorities. Our performance report describes how we are continuing to make progress and have an impact on those involved.</p>
      <p>“By working with a wide range of partners, such as colleagues in the Serious Organised Crime Taskforce, we are absolutely committed to keeping our communities safe by disrupting the activities of these groups.</p>
      <p>“This report also sets out our work as part of the Scottish Government’s drug death taskforce to seek long-term, sustainable solutions to the complex issues behind substance misuse, which will not be tackled by enforcement action alone.”</p>
