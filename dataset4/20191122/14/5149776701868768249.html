      <p>Two Nottinghamshire Schools have made the top ten list of the best schools in the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times Schools Guide 2020 has named Nottingham High School as the best independent secondary school in the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>It said more than 85 percent of pupils scored A* to B at A-levels while more than 71 percent achieved top grades - A*, A, 9, 8, and 7 at GCSE.</p>
      <p>Rushcliffe School also made the top ten list, sitting at number eight in the best state secondary schools in the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>Pupils achieved just over 62 percent of A* to B at A-level and 37.5 percent scored A*, A, 9, 8, 7 at GCSE.</p>
      <p>The 27th edition of the guide identifies the 2,000 highest-achieving schools in the UK, ranked by their recent examination results.</p>
      <p>Kevin Fear, head teacher of Nottingham High School, said: "We are thrilled to have once again been named as the top independent secondary school in the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>"Our students have been exceptionally well-supported by both their parents and our staff and have achieved outstanding results.</p>

      <p>"Equally important they are all so much more than their exam results and are impressive, well-rounded, quietly confident young men and women who thoroughly deserve their success.</p>
      <p>"Our school has thrived since our move to co-education four years ago and to have again been named as the top school in the East Midlands shows the success of this move."</p>
      <p>Damian Painton, head teacher at Rushcliffe School, added: "We are delighted to have been named as one of the top schools in the region by the Sunday Times.</p>
      <p>"It is fantastic to be recognised for the many and varied achievements of our fabulous pupils but also for the incredible work that our talented and committed staff team do each and every day to inspire and support."</p>
      <p>The full guide will be published in the paper and online on Sunday, November 24.</p>
