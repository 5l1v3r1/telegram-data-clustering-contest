      <h1>Woman, 35, 'repeatedly stabs churchgoer for wearing fur boots'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:03:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>An animal rights advocate repeatedly <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/knife-crime">stabbed</a> a woman inside a church because she was wearing fur boots, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Meredith Lowell - who was previously caught trying to hire a hitman to kill fur wearers and last year stabbed a woman - has been charged with attempted murder in the church attack.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old allegedly stabbed the victim twice in the arm and once in the abdomen in front of children before being pinned to the floor by a church staff member and parishioner.</p>
      <p>Witnesses heard a woman screaming before the victim - a babysitter who was dropping off kids for a choir practice at Fairmount Presbyterian Church - was stabbed with a kitchen knife, according to police.</p>
      <p>Children who witnessed the attack were moved into a safe area by staff.</p>
      <p>When police arrived on Wednesday evening, officers arrested Lowell and found the victim holding a wound on her left side as she lay in a pool of blood inside the church in the US city of Cleveland Heights, Ohio.</p>

      <p>Police Chief Anne Mecklenburg told <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/11/animal-rights-activist-stabbed-woman-inside-cleveland-heights-church-because-she-was-wearing-a-fur-police-say.html">Cleveland.com</a> that investigators believe Lowell stabbed the victim because she was wearing fur boots.</p>
      <p>The victim was hospitalised with injuries that weren't life-threatening, said police.</p>
      <p>A witness told police that she was sitting next to the victim when Lowell “suddenly appeared and walked through the wooden doors that leads to the main hall", <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/oh-cuyahoga/woman-who-allegedly-stabbed-woman-inside-church-was-charged-in-2012-for-hiring-hitman-to-kill-fur-wearer">News 5</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Lowell allegedly started “pushing or punching” the victim before walking away. The victim didn't realise she had been stabbed until she saw the blood.</p>
      <p>A yellow kitchen knife was recovered at the scene.</p>
      <p>Lowell, who lives close to the church, was in custody awaiting her first court appearance on charges of attempted murder and felonious assault.</p>
      <p>It comes eight years after Lowell was investigated by the FBI and charged for trying to hire a hitman on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> to kill fur wearers.</p>
      <p>She was willing to pay $830 to $850 for the hit, which she wrote was “far more than I was originally willing to pay," Cleveland.com reported.</p>
      <p>Lowell - using the fake name of "Anne Lowery" - wrote in a post: “I would like to create an online community on facebook which would allow me to find someone who is willing to kill someone who is wearing fur toward the end of October 2011 or early November 2011 or possibly in January 2012 or February 2012 at the latest."</p>
      <p>After the FBI was tipped off, an undercover agent posing as a hitman contacted the Facebook user, who was later determined to be Lowell.</p>
      <p>She told the agent: “I will pay you after you kill the person who is wearing fur at the above mentioned time and time of the year.</p>
      <p>“You need to bring a gun that has a silencer on it and that can be easily concealed in your pants pocket or coat. Do not wear anything that even looks even remotely like fur.”</p>
      <p>She said the hitman could also use a sharp knife at least 4ins long to "stab someone and/or slit their throat to kill them".</p>
      <p>She added: “I want the person to be dead in less than 2 minutes.”</p>
      <p>As the conversations continued for months, agents searched her rubbish and found animal rights literature.</p>
      <p>Shortly after her arrest in February 2012, she passed a handwritten note to jail guards saying that she would hire a hitman to kill fur wearers or would even kill a fur-wearing person herself if she was released, court records state.</p>
      <p>But federal charges, including soliciting to murder, were dismissed a year later at the request of prosecutors after Lowell was found incompetent to stand trial “based on mental disease or defect".</p>
      <p>A judge banned Lowell from possessing guns and wrote that a psychiatric evaluation found she "did not pose a danger to herself, the community, or property".</p>
      <p>Experts had found it was unlikely that Lowell could be restored to competency.</p>
      <p>She underwent mental health treatment before the case was dismissed, News 5 reported.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, Lowell stabbed a woman in a case where the motive was not known.</p>
      <p>A charge of felonious assault was transferred to a mental health court, where the case is pending.</p>
