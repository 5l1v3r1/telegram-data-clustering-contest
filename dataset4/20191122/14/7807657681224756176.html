      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Chromium version of Microsoft Edge now supports PDF inking.</li>
        <li>The feature rolled out to all Insider Preview channels for the browser.</li>
        <li>PDF inking only supports one color and stroke size right now but will expand in the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>PDF inking makes it easy to mark up documents, including signing forms and adding notes. Now, people using the Chromium-powered versions of Microsoft Edge can use PDF inking. Microsoft announced the feature's availability in a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Articles/PDF-Inking-on-Microsoft-Edge/m-p/1016006#M2245">recent post</a>. The feature is available in all Insider Preview channels for Microsoft Edge.</p>
      <p>To access PDF inking, you just need to open a PDF in a supported version of Microsoft Edge. Then, you can select the draw or erase options to mark up the document. Documents can be saved or printed with the inking included.</p>
      <p>Right now, PDF inking only supports one ink color and stroke size in the Chromium versions of Microsoft Edge, but Microsoft states that this will expand to include more options in the future. The post lists three new features that Microsoft will add to PDF inking.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for the pen back button (eraser button) to erase while in inking mode.</li>
        <li>Ability to select color and stroke thickness for ink</li>
        <li>Selection of additional pens, like highlighter pen</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you'd like to try out this feature and the rest of the preview versions of Microsoft Edge, you can download and install the Edge Beta, Dev, and Canary channel builds directly from the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/">Edge Insider site</a>.</p>
