      <p>Get ready for fights over Baby Yoda toys on Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Disney is said to be launching merchandise of the Child — the adorable, big-eyed new character that captured everyone’s hearts in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/diehard-star-wars-fans-will-love-the-mandalorian/">“The Mandalorian”</a> — just in time for holiday shopping, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-apparel-accessories-toys-and-plush-are-coming.html">CNBC reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Dubbed by adoring fans as “Baby Yoda,” the newcomer all but lends itself to mass-market appeal, so Disney plans to cash in on its popular newbie.</p>
      <p>Apparel and accessories are slated to become available as soon as Friday, hitting stores like Amazon, Zazzle, Target, Kohl’s, Macy’s, Hot Topic and, of course, the Disney Store, ShopDisney and Disney parks. Pre-sale purchases of the toys will be available in the next few weeks, but it’s not clear when they will ship.</p>
      <p>The newest character in the “Star Wars” universe who resembles infamous Jedi master Yoda debuted in <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/the-mandalorian-bundle">the first episode of the new Disney+ show</a>, completely outshining the titular main character played by Pedro Pascal.</p>
      <p>While there’s still mystery surrounding the species of the cute little green bundle of joy and where it came from, one thing is for certain: All eyes are on the Child. Jon Favreau, creator of “The Mandalorian,” tweeted original concept art for the fan-favorite character Tuesday and the tweet already has over 214,000 likes.</p>

      <p>News of “Mandalorian” merch comes just after the show’s executive producers Favreau and Dave Filoni <a href="https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/the-mandalorians-jon-favreau-and-dave-filoni-on-keeping-the-big-reveal-a-secret">told Entertainment Tonight</a> the character was kept under wraps to avoid spoilers.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to have it be that you had to watch it yourself, so that every time you watch the show, there are new twists and secrets that come out,” Favreau said. “Part of that was holding back on some of the merchandise and holding back on some of the characters.”</p>
      <p>A third episode of <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/the-mandalorian-bundle">“The Mandalorian” is set to air Friday on Disney+</a>.</p>
