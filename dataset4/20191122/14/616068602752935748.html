      <p>Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for the Central and North Okanagan, including Kelowna and Vernon.</p>
      <p>An approaching frontal system that is tracking across the southern BC Interior tonight and Saturday brings with it the risk of freezing rain Friday night and Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Flurries are expected tonight and into Saturday morning as well. The warm air aloft combined with near or below zero temperatures at the surface will result in a risk of freezing rain. Those flurries and potential freezing rain should change to rain showers Saturday afternoon as temperatures rise above zero.</p>
      <p>All surfaces including highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Drivers are advised to use extra caution when walking or driving in affected areas. Check <a href="https://www.castanet.net/traffic-cams/">Castanet</a> and<a href="https://www.drivebc.ca/mobile/pub/webcams/SouthernInterior97COkanaganConnector.html"> DriveBC</a> for the latest information.</p>
      <p>The special weather statement includes the Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Kelowna for the risk of freezing rain Friday and Saturday morning.</p>
