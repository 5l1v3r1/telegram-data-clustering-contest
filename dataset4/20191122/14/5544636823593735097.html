      <p>The month of November is gradually winding down and beneficiaries of the Federal Government’s N-Power scheme are yet to get paid their October stipend.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/news">Concise News</a> reports that this situation has <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/22/n-power-october-stipend-grumbles-continue-in-scheme/">left a chunk of them disgruntled</a> with mentions of top government officials on social media proving futile so far.</p>
      <p>The scheme habitually delay the remuneration of roughly 500, 000 volunteers, but this current non-payment is one of the longest since the programme’s inception in 2016, this online news medium gathered.</p>
      <p>A beneficiary who spoke to us on condition of anonymity expressed optimism that since the month of November is almost ended, they can get their stipends for two months paid together.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="http://www.concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> that in the past, N-Power pays backlogs of stipends to it’s beneficiaries, hence this should not be a challenge for them to sanction.</p>
      <p>She however, cannot hide her disappointment with the scheme, saying “they should have carried us along with their decisions.”</p>
      <p>She adds: “It could be a smart move moving the programmes (NSIP) to another ministry, but they should not put us in the dark, and should not because of that put us in unavoidable suffering.”</p>
      <p>Introduced in 2016 by President Muhammadu Buhari, the N-Power Programme, is a graduate and non-graduate job enhancement scheme.</p>
      <p>The objective is to enable them acquire the requisite skills, knowledge and experience for entrepreneurship and self sufficiency at the culmination of their tenure on the programme.</p>
      <p>The N-Power beneficiaries are then provided with N30, 000 (approximately 83 US Dollars) monthly stipend and devices to aid their learning and skills development.</p>
