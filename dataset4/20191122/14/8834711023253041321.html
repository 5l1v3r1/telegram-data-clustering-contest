      <h1>Gordhan Considering Legal Steps Against Bongo’s ‘Defamatory Claims’</h1>

      <p>Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is considering steps against African National Congress (ANC) MP Bongani Bongo who’s accused of corruption.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Bongo claimed Gordhan had a hand in his arrest during in an interview with eNCA.</p>
      <p>The former state security minister was released on R5,000 bail on Thursday in connection with an attempt to bribe a senior official of Parliament’s inquiry into state capture at Eskom.</p>
      <p>In an interview with eNCA, Bongo also intimated Gordhan played a part in him being poisoned, which saw him seek treatment in Cuba.</p>
      <p>But Gordhan’s spokesperson Sam Mkokeli has dismissed Bongo’s allegations: “The minister finds the whole thing ridiculous and foolish. The minister feels that Mr Bongo is hallucinating.”</p>
      <p>Mkokeli said the minister would consider his legal options but wanted to focus on more burning issues affecting the country.</p>
      <p>“He will consider his options around this defamatory statement but at this stage, he is very busy working on sorting out investors to South Africa.”</p>
