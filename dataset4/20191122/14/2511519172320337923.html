      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> has defended <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bernardo-silva">Bernardo Silva</a> after the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> playmaker received a one-match ban from the Football Association for a racist tweet.</p>
      <p>City will be without Bernardo for Saturday’s evening kick-off against Chelsea after he compared team-mate Benjamin Mendy to a racist cartoon.</p>
      <p>Bernardo was banned for one game, fined £50,000 and forced to attend a education course after admitting to have breached the FA’s misconduct rules.</p>
      <p>The cartoon – a mascot of Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos – was condemned as “discriminatory” by Kick It Out, the anti-racism in football body.</p>
      <p>Guardiola staunchly defended Bernardo against the accusations before the FA’s investigation into the incident, claiming the 25-year-old is an “exceptional person”.</p>
      <p>The City manager resumed that defence of Bernardo’s character on Friday, insisting that the authorities had targeted the wrong person.</p>
      <p>“In that situation, the most important thing is we will miss him,” Guardiola said regarding the ban. “He has been accused of something he is not. </p>
      <p>“He will be careful to use social media. If this can help to do a better society, OK. I am pretty sure Bernardo accept this punishment. </p>
      <p>“But he is not like he has been accused,” Guardiola added. “They don’t know him.”</p>
      <p>City decided not to appeal against Bernardo’s ban in fear of the one-game suspensions being extended, though believed that the punishment was excessive.</p>
