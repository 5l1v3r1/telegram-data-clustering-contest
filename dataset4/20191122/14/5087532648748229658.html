      <h1>Twitter Finally Adds Alternative Two-Factor Authentication Methods</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:28:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Twitter announced that users can finally use other two-factor authentication methods besides SMS. SMS-based authentication isn’t secure as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discovered after his account was hacked.</p>
      <h3>Twitter 2FA</h3>
      <p>Including SMS there are now three authentication methods to use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>SMS</b>: A code will be texted to you.</li>
        <li><b>Mobile Security App</b>: An authentication app like Authy or 1Password.</li>
        <li><b>Security Key</b>: A physical OTP device you can plug in to approve login attempts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the past Twitter users could add the other two methods, but only if they set up SMS first. Now that more two-factor authentication methods are available you can now delete your phone number associated with your account.</p>
      <p>So far it doesn’t seem like you can change the method in the mobile app, so you’ll have to use the website. Go to <b>Settings &amp; Privacy &gt; Account &gt; Security &gt; Two-Factor Authentication</b>.</p>
