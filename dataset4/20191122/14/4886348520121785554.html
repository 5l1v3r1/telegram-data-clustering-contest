      <p>The Dow recovered from yesterday’s losses on Friday, as investors gorged on the tastier morsels from a spate of bittersweet trade war headlines.</p>
      <p>With the clock ticking on a new round of tariff hikes, enough rumors are swirling to satisfy bullish and bearish appetites alike.</p>
      <h3>Dow Snaps 3-Day Losing Streak</h3>
      <p>The US stock market ticked higher on Friday. The <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-jones-price">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> snapped its three-day losing streak, rising 41.63 points or 0.15% to 27,807.92.</p>

      <p>The S&amp;P 500 nudged 4.7 points or 0.15% higher to 3,108.44, and the Nasdaq climbed 16.11 points or 0.19% to 8,522.32.</p>
      <p>The gold price also recovered; the yellow metal bounced 0.37% to $1,469, despite the risk-on move in stocks. The <a href="https://www.ccn.com/china-dispose-crypto-exchanges-as-bitcoin-plummets/">bitcoin price was not so lucky</a>, and the leading cryptocurrency careened below $7,000 to extend its brutal plunge.</p>
      <h3>Trump &amp; Xi Weigh in on State of Trade Talks</h3>
      <p>The Dow and its peers cautiously advanced amid a deluge of dizzying trade war headlines that mostly confirmed whatever preconceived notions investors already harbored.</p>
      <p>Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both weighed in on the state of US-China relations, but neither man said anything that fundamentally altered the trade war forecast.</p>

      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-us-china-trade-deal-very-close">President Trump told “Fox and Friends” that the US was “very close” to reaching a trade deal with China</a>. That should be wildly bullish for stocks, except that he’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-trade-trump/trump-says-u-s-close-to-signing-phase-one-trade-deal-with-china-idUSKBN1XM2DH">made the same claim</a> multiple times since Oct. 11 – when he said that the two countries had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-11/u-s-china-said-to-reach-partial-deal-could-set-up-trade-truce-k1melw60">already agreed to the outlines</a> of a deal.</p>
      <p>Considering that Trump administration officials have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-mnuchin/us-treasury-secretary-says-us-china-trade-deal-is-90-done-cnbc-idUSFWN23X03U">referring to the trade deal as “90% complete” for five months</a>, investors may be growing wary of bold White House predictions.</p>
      <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping was more measured in his assessment of the trade war. Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Friday, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3038922/china-wants-us-trade-deal-will-fight-back-if-necessary-says">Xi said that China never wanted to wage a trade war</a> with the US. However, he also said that China would fight to defend its interests.</p>
      <blockquote>“We want to work for a phase one agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality,” Xi said. “When necessary we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war. We did not initiate this trade war and this is not something we want.”</blockquote>
      <p>Both countries have repeatedly expressed their desire to fast-track a trade agreement. However, they have been unable to compromise on longstanding sticking points that have repeatedly foiled proposed agreements – even ones that sought to narrow the focus to issues on which Washington and Beijing were more or less on the same page.</p>

      <h3>Tariffs Will Escalate Before Trade Deal Arrives</h3>
      <p>Consequently, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/phase-one-trade-deal-may-not-be-signed-before-dec-15-us-chamber-of-commerce.html">US Chamber of Commerce has warned</a> that even if the US and China finally put ink to paper on a phase one trade deal, it’s unlikely to happen until after a new round of tariffs kicks in on Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC:</p>
      <blockquote>We’re going to have just a few weeks now and I’m not sure we’re going to get a deal done by Dec. 15.</blockquote>
      <p>Brilliant added that the US business community desperately wants Washington and Beijing to unwind their tariff tit-for-tat. However, investors need to temper their expectations for tariff rollbacks.</p>
      <blockquote>“China very much wants to see a rollback on the tariffs. By the way, so does the American business community,” he said. “But we’re not going to see an elimination of all the tariffs after phase one.”</blockquote>
