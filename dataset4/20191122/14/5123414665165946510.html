      <p>After nearly a four-year absence, <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/richie-hawtin/">Richie Hawtin</a> returns to the City of Angels this Saturday night for a rare, one-night performance of his critically-acclaimed audio/visual set-up, CLOSE. A show which earned him the award for best live performance at the <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/dj-awards/">DJ Awards</a> back in 2017 and he debuted it that same year just a few hours east of L.A. at <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/coachella/">Coachella</a>. Don't fret if you were there for that though because the performance is said to be like no other thanks to a 100 percent improvised format guaranteeing that no two shows can be alike.</p>
      <p>Check out the following <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/2019/09/richie-hawtin-releases-av-compilation-album-close-combined/">67 minute sample</a> of what to expect:</p>
