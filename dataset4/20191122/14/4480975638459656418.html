      <p><b>Aurora Cannabis Inc.</b> (ACB) has been a star performer. Shares of the Edmonton-based firm have soared <b>38% in three days</b> amid a euphoric melt-up of pot stocks. </p>
      <p>Sellers that have feared Aurora's <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/aurora-cannabis-stock-price-debentures-upbeat-survey-keep-it-bid-outlook-cautiously-optimistic-201911211435">dilutive debentures</a> scheme have been weeded out. The equity bottomed out at $3.00 on Monday before shooting for the highs. Despite the unattractive financial offer, it was <b>taken up by 94% of buyers</b>, well ahead of the March 2020 deadline. The <b>robust participation</b> shows a high level of trust in the company.</p>

      <p><b>ACB shares closed at $4.14 on Thursday</b>, which is more than half the drop from the November 13 peak of $5.03 to the trough of $3.00. However, at an increase of 56%, the recovery falls short of the <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> 61.8%</b> that would convince technical traders to join in. </p>
      <p>It is also essential to note that Aurora Cannabis' price peaked at $13.67 in the past 52 weeks – and at current prices, it is nearly <b>70% down</b>, albeit substantially above the bottom of $2.82.</p>
      <h4>Investing in Marijuana Stocks</h4>
      <p>Marijuana stocks have experienced considerable <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility">volatility</a>, and the recent upswing for the whole sector may be attributed to <b>Jerrod Nadler</b>, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The New York Democrat oversaw the passage of a bill that aims to <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/marijuana-stocks-price-more-act-lifts-prices-from-lows-financials-still-weigh-201911201155">legalize cannabis on the federal level</a>. The promising 24 to 10 vote indicates that broad support. However, members of the lower chamber were warned that the upper one is unlikely to take it up. </p>
      <p>Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is a life-long opponent of legalizing marijuana. The Kentucky Republican may particularly be opposed to provisions to expunge past criminal records. The right-wing party has a tough stance on crime. </p>
      <p>Regulation may have a further impact on cannabis stocks. ACB's shares remain at the forefront of weed stocks. </p>
