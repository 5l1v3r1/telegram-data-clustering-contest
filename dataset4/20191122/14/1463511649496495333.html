      <h1>Appeal Court affirms Tambuwal’s election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:49:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Appeal Court sitting in Sokoto on Friday upheld the election of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as duly elected.</p>
      <p>The four-man panel in a unanimous decision upheld Tambuwal’s election after dismissing the Appeal filed by the Appellant and governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu for lacking in merit.</p>
      <p>Delivering judgment, Justice Hussein Mukhtar, held that the judgment of the lower tribunal was in order that the petitioners had failed to establish their claims to non-compliance with the Electoral Act and the issue of over voting.</p>
      <p>Aliyu is challenging the tribunal judgment that affirmed the election of Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party at the 2019 Governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>The Governorship Election which held on March 9 was declared inconclusive following cancellation of 75, 403 votes which were higher than the 3, 413 votes margin between the leading candidates.</p>
      <p>The re-run was then conducted on March 23, which led to the victory of Tambuwal who won with a slim margin of 342 votes.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria recalls that the Governorship Election Tribunal, on October 2, in Abuja affirmed the election of Tambuwal.</p>
      <p>The three man tribunal led by Justice Abbas Bawale dismissed the petition of the APC and its governorship candidate, Aliyu, for lacking in merit.</p>
      <p>Unsatisfied with the tribunal judgment Aliyu, on October 16, filed a notice of Appeal challenging the judgment of the lower court, seeking the court to set aside the tribunal judgment and declare him as the winner of the election.</p>
