      <p>Life on Earth was fuelled by sugar that came from outer space.</p>
      <p>Galaxy chocolate bars really can be traced back to extra-terrestrial meteorites that crashed into the planet billions of years ago.</p>
      <p>An analysis of asteroids found they contained a natural sweetener called ribose – found in confectionery today.</p>
      <p>It is used by every cell in the body. It is also a vital ingredient of RNA (ribonucleic acid), one of the three major biological chemicals for all known forms of life.</p>
      <p>Lead author Professor Yoshihiro Furukawa, of Tohoku University, Japan, said: ‘The research provides the first direct evidence of ribose in space and the delivery of the sugar to Earth.</p>
      <p>‘The extraterrestrial sugar might have contributed to the formation of RNA on the pre-biotic Earth, which possibly led to the origin of life.’</p>
      <p>It may also have helped kick start life on other planets and moons outside the solar system, say his NASA team. Prof Furukawa said: ‘The mineral compositions of these meteorites further suggest the formation of these sugars both before and after the accretion of their parent asteroids.’</p>

      <p>‘Meteorites were carriers of pre-biotic organic molecules to the early Earth. So the detection of extraterrestrial sugars in meteorites establishes the existence of natural geological routes to make and preserve them.</p>

      <p>‘It also raises the possibility extraterrestrial sugars contributed to forming functional biopolymers like RNA on the early Earth or other primitive worlds.’</p>
      <p>The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed powder collected from two ancient meteorites.</p>
      <p>One is named Murchison after the Australian town near where it fell in 1969 and the other NWA 801 which was discovered in Morocco in 2001. Both space rocks are believed to date back more than 4.5 billion years – making them older than Earth itself.</p>
      <p>Prof Furukawa and colleagues used a scanning technique called gas chromatography mass spectrometry that identifies molecules by their weight and electric charge.</p>
      <p>Small amounts of ribose were found in both rocks – up to 11 parts per billion in NWA 801 and up to 180 parts per billion in Murchison. There were also trace amounts of other sugars, including xylose and arabinose.</p>

      <p>It is believed RNA was the first molecule to carry genetic information in Earth’s earliest lifeforms, well before the two other major ingredients – DNA and proteins – became commonplace.</p>
      <p>It suggests sugar from space bombarded early Earth – and helped life take shape, said the researchers.</p>
      <p>Co-author Dr Danny Glavin, of NASA’s Goddard Center for Astrobiology in the US, said: ‘This is important since there could have been a delivery bias of extraterrestrial ribose to the early Earth, which is consistent with the hypothesis that RNA evolved first.’</p>
      <p>Scientists will soon have another chance to skim the sugar off of some ancient space rocks, when Japan’s Hayabusa2 and NASA’s OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft return samples of the asteroids Bennu and Ryugu to Earth.</p>

      <p>These asteroids have never come in contact with Earth and are between a few hundred million and a billion years old each.</p>

      <p>They could help scientists prove which types of molecules truly originate off of our planet – and which showed up only after the sugar was served.</p>
      <p>Co-author Dr Jason Dworkin, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, added: ‘It is remarkable a molecule as fragile as ribose could be detected in such ancient material.’</p>
