      <p><i>Three Jokers</i> is a story that's over four years in the making, as the seeds were first planted in Johns and Fabok's <i>Justice League</i> #42 in June 2015. In that issue, Batman used the newly acquired powers of the Mobius Chair to ask two questions: Who really killed his parents, and what was The Joker’s real name? However, it wasn't until eight months later – the day <i>Justice League </i>#50 and <i>DC Universe: Rebirth </i>#1 hit stands -- that we finally got our answer as to what the Mobius Chair told Batman: "There are three."</p>

      <p>In June, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/three-jokers-jason-fabok-update/">Fabok revealed</a> he was hard at work on the miniseries and that the interior art was taking him twice as long as any of his previous projects, writing, "I want to give the readers my everything."</p>
      <p><i>Batman: Three Jokers</i> #1, by Geoff Johns and Jason Fabok, has yet to receive a release date. However, judging by Fabok's tweet, it's likely readers can expect the first of the three 46-page issues to arrive some time in 2020.</p>
