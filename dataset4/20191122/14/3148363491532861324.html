      <h2>President Donald Trump said Friday he looked forward to a Senate impeachment trial, noting the Democrat-led impeachment investigation was a “scam.”</h2>

      <p>“Frankly, I want a trial,” Trump said in an interview on <i>Fox and Friends. </i></p>
      <p>Trump criticized the House Intelligence Committee investigation for blocking due process for the White House and Republicans. He said a Senate trial would allow Republicans to get testimony from important witnesses such as the so-called “whistleblower,” Hunter Biden, and House Oversight Chairman Adam Schiff himself.</p>
      <p>“There’s only one person that I want to see more, and that’s Adam Schiff … I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the “whistleblower,” who’s a fake whistleblower,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump mocked “Shifty Schiff” for pretending not to know the “whistleblower,” even though his staff met with him before filing the complaint.</p>
      <p>“I know exactly who it is,” he said, referring to the identity of the “whistleblower.”</p>
      <p>When Fox News played a clip of an angered Schiff raging against the president’s actions in his closing statement from the first round of impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>“Let me tell you he’s a sick puppy … this guy, Adam Schiff is a sick puppy,” Trump said. “He makes it all up. He’s sick. There’s something wrong with him.”</p>
      <p>Trump mocked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for allowing Democrats to begin the proceedings.</p>
      <p>“I have to deal with crazy Nancy. She is crazy as a bedbug. She is nuts,” Trump said. “What she’s doing, and she’s not talented, she’s highly overrated.”<br/>Trump said he had a hard time believing that House Democrats would vote to impeach him, repeating that there was “nothing there.”</p>
      <p>“By the way, they looked like fools over the last five days,” he said. “These interviews, these were their witnesses. This was the best they have got.”</p>
