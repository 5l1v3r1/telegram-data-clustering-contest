      <h1>David Lynch-directed advertisement for Playstation welcomes you to The Third Place</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:30:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/jstruan" target="_blank">John Struan</a></address>
      <p>Once upon a time, people had so much free time that they needed a place to go that wasn't work or home. A third place. Sony was one of the companies competing for that space, and created an entire campaign around the concept. They hired David Lynch to direct a commercial for the Playstation 2 because "He's been living in The Third Place for quite a few years."</p>
      <p>The commercial is predictably surreal, makes no detectable reference to video games, and could easily be reused for other products with equal success:</p>

      <p>Lynch <a href="https://welcometotwinpeaks.com/lynch/david-lynch-playstation-commercial-making-of/">received some pushback</a> on choosing black and white, but artistic version prevailed over the color version:</p>

      <p>There is also a short documentary on the making of the commercial that feels suitably Lynchian--moments of levity amidst a murky, ominous set:</p>
