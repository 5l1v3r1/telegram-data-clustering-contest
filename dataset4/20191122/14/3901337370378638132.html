      <p>Knowing his place in the starting line-up was always guaranteed is the reason Rivaldo Coetzee left Ajax Cape Town two years ago, the versatile player has said.</p>
      <p>A product of the Urban Warriors youth academy, joining the club at 15, Coetzee felt he was too comfortable in the final years of his Ajax stint.</p>

      <p>When a potential move to Celtic in the Scottish Premier League collapsed after he failed a medical, Mamelodi Sundowns took a gamble and signed him despite an injury that threatened to cut short his young career.</p>
      <p>But Coetzee, now 23-years-old, says he was ready to move away from the Mother City.</p>
      <p>“This is why I left Ajax – for me it became too easy. I would go to training knowing already that I would play and that didn’t help my progress,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That’s why I decided to come to Sundowns and I knew the competition that they have here in the team, and that’s what I wanted. That is what I was looking for, the reason I came here.”</p>
      <p>Coetzee will he hoping he again breaks into the starting line-up tomorrow afternoon when Sundowns face Golden Arrows in the semi-final of the Telkom Knockout for a chance to reach the final and end their four-year domestic cup drought.</p>
