      <p>Actress Rani Mukerji, who was in attendance at the iconic Eden Gardens on the first day of the historic pink-ball Test match between India and Bangladesh, shared that she is a huge fan of legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar.</p>
      <p>“My favourite cricketer has always been Sunil Gavaskar. The reason behind this is, when I was young my parents watched a lot of cricket, and I have seen him play from those days. When I used to watch him play – there was some enigma around him when he used to walk to the ground; it was electrifying,” Rani said while promoting her upcoming film “Mardaani 2” on Star Sports’ pre-show Nerolac Cricket Live.</p>

      <p>She also shared her admiration for Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli.</p>
      <p>“Kapil Dev is also one of my favourite cricketers; the way he speaks, the way he was on the pitch, the fire in his eyes, I was completely bowled over by him. After them, it was Sourav Da and Sachin Tendulkar whose game I enjoyed watching while I was growing up. Virat is doing exceptionally well now, he is close to us as he has married Anushka Sharma,” Rani added.</p>
      <p>“Mardaani 2” focuses on the rise in violent crimes by juveniles in India and has definitely sparked a conversation on the threat this poses to young girls. It is set to hit theatres on December 13.</p>
