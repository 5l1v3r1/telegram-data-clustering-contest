      <p>MANCHESTER, England -- Pep Guardiola has reiterated his defence of <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/199833/Bernardo-Silva">Bernardo Silva</a> despite the Manchester City midfielder <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-city/story/3988877/manchester-citys-bernardo-silva-banned-and-fined-over-benjamin-mendy-tweet">being found guilty of sending a racist tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>Silva will miss Chelsea's visit to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday after being handed a one-match ban and a Â£50,000 fine following a social media post which referenced teammate <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/159318/Benjamin-Mendy">Benjamin Mendy</a>.</p>

      <p>Guardiola hinted that Silva had been an easy target for the Football Association and took the opportunity at his weekly news conference to insist the Portugal international is not a racist.</p>
      <p>"The less important thing is that we are going to miss him -- he's been accused of something he's not," Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>"If they want to pick up someone to show something it was the right person.</p>
      <p>"He will be careful with social media but if this can help make a better society then <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/218980/Bernardo">Bernardo</a> will accept it. But he's not what he's accused of."</p>
      <p>Guardiola has also had to deal with the fall-out from <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156366/Raheem-Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a>'s difficult international break during which the winger was <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/england-eng/story/3987992/raheem-sterling-dropped-by-england-after-training-camp-row-with-joe-gomez">dropped by England manager Gareth Southgate</a> following an altercation with Liverpool defender <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/102053/Joe-Gomez">Joe Gomez</a>.</p>
      <p>"He's good," Guardiola said. "I spoke with him, he's fine. He said Gomez is an excellent guy, they have a good relationship, it sometimes happens."</p>
      <p>The City manager has also seen his rivalry with Jose Mourinho restart after the Portuguese was <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994171/jose-mourinho-takes-over-as-new-tottenham-hotspur-manager">named Tottenham's new manager</a> following the dismissal of Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been out of work for nearly a year since his dismissal at Manchester United but is back in the Premier League with a third club.</p>
      <p>"I think you [the media] know him better than me, many years here, welcome back, an incredible manager I'm pretty sure he'll do a good job," Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>"A little surprised, he [Pochettino] has done incredible, all the managers are judged on titles but it's not the truth, in the time he was there the club was better.</p>
      <p>"When a manager leaves you want the club and team to be better than the moment you took over, that happened but the decisions are made and there's nothing else to say."</p>
