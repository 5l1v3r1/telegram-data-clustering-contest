      <p>A “cold-blooded” crossbow killer who shot his heavily pregnant ex-wife in an act of revenge is facing life behind bars.</p>
      <p>Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, burst into the home of Sana Muhammad and fired an arrow into her stomach as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad, 35, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died.</p>
      <p>Her unborn son – her sixth child – was delivered by Caesarean section and miraculously survived.</p>
      <p>A jury rejected the defendant’s claim it was an accident and found him guilty of murder after four hours of deliberations.</p>
      <p>Unmathallegadoo made no reaction as the verdict was delivered following a retrial at the Old Bailey.</p>
      <p>Adjourning sentencing to November 29, Judge Mark Lucraft QC told the defendant: “You have been convicted of the most horrendous crime in the face of your own children and it’s extremely grave what you have carried out.”</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Mrs Muhammad’s widower paid tribute to his outgoing and bubbly “soul mate”.</p>
      <p>Imtiaz Muhammad said: “She was very friendly, talkative and always made me laugh. She was my soul mate, my best friend, my wife, my companion and my everything and I love her dearly.</p>
      <p>“Ram must have been very jealous of the life Sana and I had and that we were living a happy life.”</p>
      <p>He said his wife had been “scared” of the defendant, adding: “She would always say ‘Ram does not forgive and forget, he likes to create trouble no matter if he loses everything’.”</p>
      <p>Her mother, Ellemah Sutharamandoo, said she was “overwhelmed” with sadness.</p>
      <p>She said: “I always treated Ramanodge as my own son, I always thought of him and his wellbeing after the separation. It brings me so much pain to know that he could be capable of something so hateful and so calculated. I cannot forgive him.”</p>

      <p>The court heard how the victim had an arranged marriage to the defendant in Mauritius on her 16th birthday. He was 30 at the time.</p>
      <p>Their unhappy relationship ended in 2012 after an incident in which she jumped out of an upstairs window and broke her ankle.</p>
      <p>After a trial in 2013, he was cleared of attacking her and acquitted on the judge’s direction of a charge of attempted strangulation under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861.</p>
      <p>She successfully filed for an emergency non-molestation order which barred the defendant from coming within 100 metres of the family home in Ilford, east London.</p>
      <p>Following her divorce, she married builder Imtiaz Muhammad and changed her name to Sana Muhammad.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the defendant lost his job as a site manager at Newham General Hospital and slept rough as he plotted revenge.</p>

      <p>On the morning of November 12 2018, he took up position in the garden shed armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer.</p>
      <p>He was disturbed by Mr Muhammad who had gone into the garden to store an empty box.</p>
      <p>The defendant ran inside the house and shot his ex-wife with an 18-inch arrow as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>As Unmathallegadoo’s oldest children rushed in to disarm him, the defendant said: “It would have been easier if you guys weren’t here, like I would have done it.”</p>
      <p>The prosecution suggested Unmathallegadoo’s plan had been to restrain the family and at least kill the two adults and the unborn child.</p>
      <p>Susan Krikler, from the Crown Prosecution Service, described the killing as a “cold-blooded and calculated execution”.</p>
      <p>She said: “This devastating attack has left six children without their mother. I hope today’s conviction provides some comfort to those who loved and cared for Devi.”</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Amjad Sharif, of Scotland Yard, said: “At a time when she should have been happily looking forward to the birth of her new child, Sana Muhammad was killed in cold blood by her ex-husband, Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances and detail of the case are harrowing and I would like to pay tribute to the strength and dignity of Sana’s friends and family, some of who have given evidence during the trial. ”</p>
      <p>It can now be reported that Unmathallegadoo’s first trial collapsed after a juror raised an issue of psychiatric illness against the judge’s direction not to speculate and despite no evidence being heard about his mental state.</p>
