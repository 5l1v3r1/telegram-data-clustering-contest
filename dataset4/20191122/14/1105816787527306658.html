      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Eminent Sufi singer Manjhee Fakeer has demanded security from law enforcement agencies and the Sindh government after he was threatened by a mob on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Around two dozen miscreants stormed Fakeer’s village of Bharoon Sharif and chanted religious slogans, condemning the message of inter-faith harmony that the singer promotes through his music.</p>
      <p>The signboard guiding passersby to FaKeer Dur Muhammad shrine was also dismantled on the main Nawabshah-Sangrh road.</p>
      <p>Members of the civil society also called out the authorities for the lack of action, after the video of the incident went viral.</p>
      <p>Explaining the details of the incident, Faqeer told <i>The Express Tribune</i> that he knew who had tried to hatch a conspiracy against him. “They want me to stop spreading the message of humanity,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s not the first time. I am not against any religious group and leader. I am not against any religion,” he explained. “Through poetry and singing, we just spread the message of love, humanity, and peace.”</p>
      <p>DIG Nawabshah has also ensured strict action against the mob. “I have been ensured that action would be taken against culprits,” said Fakeer.</p>
      <p>Sindh Minister for Culture and Tourism Syed Sardar Ali Shah has also directed Sindh Police to initiate an inquiry into the matter and reassured  Faqeer of immediate action against the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Faqeer is popular for singing poetry of Sufi giants such as Shah Latif, Sachal Sarmasat, Sufi Shah Inayat and other prominent Sufi saints of the region.</p>
