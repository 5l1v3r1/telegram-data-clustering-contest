      <h1>Report: When Kansas Should Find Out NCAA Punishment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:52:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Back on September 23, Kansas <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/kansas-jayhawks/kansas-ncaa-response-notice-of-allegations">received its Notice of Allegations from the NCAA</a>. The college basketball blue blood could be facing very serious punishment over its involvement in the adidas-based scandal at the center of the FBI’s probe into the sport.</p>
      <p>The punishment that KU faces could be very serious, if <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/kansas-jayhawks/ncaa-ban-kansas-basketball">recent examples like Georgia Tech hold up</a>. Now, we have an idea of when the Jayhawks could find out their fate.</p>
      <p>Per Yahoo Sports reporter Pete Thamel, KU’s timeline has been changed, and it now has 90 days from today to respond to the notice. He estimates that a decision could be rendered around August 2020.</p>
      <p>Of course, there is the possibility that Kansas is aggressive in fighting whatever infractions come down, using the North Carolina playbook. If that is the case, this whole issue might push into 2021.</p>

      <p>KU’s initial response to the Notice of Allegations back in September signals that it isn’t going to lay down here. The school came to the early defense of head coach Bill Self.</p>
      <blockquote>As for the allegations regarding Head Men’s Basketball Coach Bill Self, voluminous evidence demonstrates uncontestably that he did, in fact, promote an atmosphere of compliance and fully monitor his staff. The University firmly and fully supports Coach Self and his staff.</blockquote>
      <p>The school has also managed to quell the fears of recruits, as it deals with this fallout. After committing to the Jayhawks, five-star Bryce Thompson revealed what the Kansas basketball administration <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/kansas-jayhawks/bryce-thompson-kansas-commitment-ncaa-sanctions">told him about the issue</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“I am aware of the controversy currently surrounding Kansas. It did concern me a bit at the beginning, until I went on my visit and I was able to talk face-to-face with some of the administration, including athletic director Jeff Long.<br/><br/>“My mom doesn’t play. She asked every question in the book. Mr. Long was able to answer them directly and stayed on point. He didn’t veer off into some other conversation. I appreciated that.”</blockquote>
      <p>After dropping the season opener to Duke by two points, KU has rolled through its last three opponents. The Jayhawks start play in the Maui Invitational, drawing host Chaminade on Monday.</p>
