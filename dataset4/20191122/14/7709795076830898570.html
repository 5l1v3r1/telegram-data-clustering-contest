      <h1>Angels Breath 14/1 for Arkle with Sky Bet following chasing debut win at Ascot</h1>

        <b>The Nicky Henderson-trained Angels Breath earned a 14/1 Arkle quote with Sky Bet following a taking first start over fences at Ascot on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The grey five-year-old was one of two highly-regarded horses from the Seven Barrows yard in the Sky Sports Racing Novices' Chase and the betting got it spot on regarding the pair, with Angels Breath a well-backed 5/4 chance under Nico De Boinville.</p>
      <p>Stablemate Birchdale, the initial favourite, proved easy to back and ran as though the experience was needed, ending up a well-held third of four runners.</p>
      <p>Second went to the front-running First Flow for Kim Bailey and David Bass, but he was a spent force coming to the second last fence and ended up eight lengths adrift of the impressive winner, who popped the last and was eased down on the run-in.</p>
      <p>Sky Bet cut Angels Breath to 14/1 from 25/1 for the Racing Post Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham in March and made the same antepost alteration for the JLT Novices' Chase at the Festival.</p>
      <p>Angels Breath was taking his Ascot record to two-from-two, having made a winning hurdling debut in a Grade Two contest at the same venue last December, after which he was second at Kempton before finishing seventh behind Klassical Dream when 6/1 for the Sky Bet Supreme Novices' Hurdle.</p>

      <p>Henderson said: "He was slick wasn't he, as he is not the biggest. The funny thing is that he gave us all the impression last season he wanted good ground.</p>
      <p>"Nico (De Boinville) said he couldn't believe it the way he went down in the soft ground as we don't do soft ground at home and he absolutely loved it.</p>
      <p>"It was a proper gallop and Birchdale (stablemate) couldn't go with them. I didn't think they would outpace Birchdale like that but they have gone a solid pace considering the ground.</p>
      <p>"He has had a solid blow and he will come on a fair bit for it. He has been good at home. The one lovely thing about that race is you are jumping six fences up hill and they are lovely fences to start with for a novice."</p>
      <p>Assessing future targets for Angels Breath, who was cut into 8-1 for the JLT and 10-1 for the Arkle by Paddy Power, the Seven Barrows handler hinted he could return to the course for the Grade Two Noel Novices' Chase next month.</p>
      <p>He added: "I'd be hanging around at two and half (miles) for the time being I would think. That (Noel Novices' Chase) is probably the obvious one but I've not thought about pre-planning yet."</p>
