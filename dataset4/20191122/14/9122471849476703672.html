      <h1>Colin Cowherd Reveals Score Prediction For Major Week 13 Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:22:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Week 13 of the college football season is here, with a few major rivalry match-ups on the docket. Colin Cowherd has unveiled his predictions for three of the biggest games coming up this weekend.</p>
      <p>Each week on “The Herd”, Cowherd discusses his “Marquee 3.” Those are three big games he provides his picks for, both straight up and against the spread.</p>
      <p>This week, Cowherd <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHerd/status/1197877271412928520">gave his thoughts</a> on Ohio State-Penn State, USC vs. UCLA and Michigan vs. Indiana. He is taking the favorite to win all three games, however, he likes Penn State and Indiana to both cover the spread. Cowherd suggested both Ohio State and Michigan are looking forward to their matchup next week and will struggle – but win – this weekend.</p>
      <p>Below are Cowherd’s score predictions for all three games.</p>
      <blockquote>Ohio State 33, Penn State 23<br/><br/>Michigan 27, Indiana 23<br/><br/>USC 36, UCLA 16</blockquote>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State get the party started this weekend with a noon kickoff. ESPN College GameDay, FOX Sports’ Big Noon Kickoff and the Big Ten Network will all be in Columbus for one of the biggest games of the year.</p>
      <p>Michigan and Indiana square off at 3:30 p.m. ET on ESPN, while USC and UCLA kick off at 3:30 p.m. ET on ABC.</p>
