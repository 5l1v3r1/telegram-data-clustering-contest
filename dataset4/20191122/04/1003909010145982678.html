      <h1>Grey Cup seats slowly filling up as kickoff approaches</h1>

      <p>Only days before the kickoff of the 107th Grey Cup, hundreds of tickets are still available — but the price doesn’t appear to be a concern for those who already secured their seats at the game.</p>
      <p>Canadians, including Troy Denton and his wife Pam, have travelled from far and wide for the championship game. Denton, from New Brunswick, said the price wasn’t a consideration to get a chance to see what will surely be a historic Canadian Football League match.</p>
      <p>“We had to be out here for meetings, so we said ‘it’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be here and go’, we’re looking forward to it,” said Denton, who paid $300 each for his and his wife’s tickets. “It’s about what I expected. It’s the Canadian party of the year.”</p>
      <p>In October, Grey Cup organizers said they were targeting a sellout for the game, but with so many tickets still available, it seems it might take a Hail Mary to get there.</p>
      <p>On Ticketmaster, the lowest price for a ticket on Thursday was just over $250, for a seat in the 40th row of section X. Other tickets are reaching up to $569 for a seat in the 25th row on the 55-yard line.</p>
      <p>Some local fans had complained amid a slumping economy that prices were too high for the game that will seat 36,000. But Paul Stones is another person who gladly paid the cost and travelled across the country for the game.</p>
      <p>Going to a Grey Cup game his hometown Hamilton Tiger-Cats are in was on Stones’ bucket list his whole life, so the $250 ticket was well worth it.</p>
      <p>“Not bad for where I am — I’m (sitting in) row five, the players come out this way,” he said, gesturing to his left. “It’s good value — it’s a dream come true.”</p>
      <p>Tickets for the game had started at $119 for seats in the top four corners of the stadium, with discounts available for season ticket-holders who had already renewed for next season.</p>
      <p>Unlike the Grey Cup game Calgary hosted in 2009, none of the 10,000-seat temporary bleachers were added for this year’s showdown. Instead, organizers chose to install late-season suites in the north end zone that accommodate far fewer.</p>
      <p>Organizers with the Grey Cup committee were not available for comment.</p>
