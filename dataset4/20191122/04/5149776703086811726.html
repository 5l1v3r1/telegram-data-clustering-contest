        <b>SABRI'S INJURY UPDATE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nottingham Forest have been boosted by the return of Alfa Semedo, Carl Jenkinson, Yohan Benalouane and Michael Hefele to training.</p>
      <p>But boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> has hinted Saturday’s trip to Bristol City may come too soon for the quartet as he is keen not to take any risks with his players.</p>

        <b>HOW ROBINS WILL COPE WITH GRABBAN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bristol City will pay close attention to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> striker Lewis Grabban when the two clubs meet in a play-off showdown at Ashton Gate, with just goal difference separating the two clubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/lewis-grabban">Grabban</a> is one of the Championship’s most potent marksmen already having seven goals to his name this term, and Nathan Baker has revealed just what detail the Robins have paid to the experienced finisher, although he refused to be drawn on suggestions the 31-year-old is the best in the division.</p>

        <b>LIFE AS A FOREST FAN MUST BE GREAT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ian McParland believes life as a Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> supporter is great as the club aim to end their two-decade wait for Premier League football.</p>
      <p>The Reds are nestled nicely inside the Championship’s top six after 15 games of the season, and could cement their place with a win at play-off rivals Bristol City this weekend.</p>

        <b>WILL THIS BE LAMOUCHI'S STARTING XI AT ASHTON GATE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi faces one of his biggest tests as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> head coach on Saturday, when he takes his side to promotion rivals Bristol City.</p>
      <p>Its sixth vs fifth in front of what’s shaping up to be <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-nottingham-forest-crowd-3564208">Ashton Gate’s biggest crowd of the season</a>, with the hosts looking to make it seven games unbeaten at home, and Forest hoping for a fifth win on the road.</p>
      <p>Both sides come into the game on the back of 1-0 wins over local rivals, with Forest seeing off Derby and Bristol City winning at Cardiff to spell the end for Bluebirds boss Neil Warnock and are only separated by goal difference.</p>

        <b>SABRI ON A SCOUTING MISSION?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> manager Sabri Lamouchi was spotted at a French top flight match during the international break.</p>
      <p>While many of his players were jetting off for a short break, after the Reds beat arch-rivals Derby County 1-0 in the Championship, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Lamouchi</a> was pictured in the stands at the Ligue 1 clash between Marseille and Lyon at the Stade Velodrome.</p>

        <b>MARINAKIS' VISION FOR FOREST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Forest ace <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Joe Worrall</a> has spoken about the importance of the club’s future being at the City Ground.</p>
      <p>Rather than build a new stadium elsewhere - which had been explored in the past - the Reds have opted to redevelop their home on the banks of the Trent, setting in motion <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-stadium-3541842">a multi-million pound project</a> to transform it into a world-class venue.</p>
      <p>The plans were unveiled earlier this year and a planning application is now expected to be submitted before the end of the year.</p>

      <h3>GAYLE PLAYING THE WAITING GAME</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United will “listen to offers” for reported <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> target Dwight Gayle in January.</p>
      <p>The Reds were said to be keen on the striker in the summer, and it has been claimed they <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/dwight-gayle-nottingham-forest-newcastle-3449184">could reignite their interest</a> when the window opens in a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Gayle has featured just twice for the Magpies under Steve Bruce this season, coming off the bench against both Chelsea and Wolves last month.</p>
