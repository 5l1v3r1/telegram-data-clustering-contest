      <p>The native doctor responsible for burning the hands of a 13-year-old boy whose was accused of being a wizard in Nasarawa has been arrested.</p>
      <p>The native doctor was consulted by the step-mother of the 13-year-old boy, Ovey Friday, who claimed he was sleeping with her in the dream and she needed him to confess and also get the spirit out of him.This led the native doctor to heap coals of fire on the boy’s hands which was tied up.</p>

      <p>The native doctor, Adamu Musa. in Wulko Community, Nasarawa Eggon Local Government Area, Nasarawa State was arrested after the incident led to a permanent deformity of his right hand while the left hand was amputated at an Abuja hospital on November 14th.</p>
      <p>45-year old Adamu Musa has also denied the claim, he insists he only rubbed a herbal substance on his hands.</p>
      <blockquote>“They are saying, I burnt his hands but I didn’t burn his hands. It is just a medicine I rubbed over his hands to ascertain if he is possessed or not and I told them(the stepmother and paternal grandmother), that if he is possessed, he would vomit and if he is not his hands will swell severely. It is the medicine that made his hands like that because he is not possessed” he said</blockquote>
      <p>The victim however dismissed the herbalists claim. Ovey in a chat with Channels TV, said;</p>
      <blockquote>”He is lying, he burnt my hands and the whole act didn’t happen in the presence of my stepmother and paternal grandmother. They were in another room and we were in another” .</blockquote>
      <p>The state police commissioner, Bola Longe, said the suspects will be charged to court.</p>
      <blockquote>“They are being subjected to exhaustive interrogation to know the veracity of their statement. We will definitely charge them to court when we complete the investigation and it will be very soon and we want to use the case to send a message to members of the public particularly those who are saddled with the affairs of taking care of children. No one should show wickedness any child and quine who does so will face the full wrath of the law,” he said.</blockquote>
      <p>The father of the boy, Friday has finally showed up for the first time since the incident happened in October 28th. Amidst several phone calls, he was still not present during the surgery and since his arrival on Monday,18th November, he still hasn’t visited his son at the hospital.</p>
