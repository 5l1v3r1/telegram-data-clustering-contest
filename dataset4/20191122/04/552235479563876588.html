      <h1>Glasgow University Rector hits out after Police Scotland fail to alert students to sex attacks</h1>
      <h2>Aamer Anwar has demanded answers from the Chief Constable in a joint letter written with the university's student president.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sally Hind, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sally-hind/</a></address>
      <p>The Rector of Glasgow University has raised “grave concerns” with police chiefs after students were not told of a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-under-fire-after-glasgow-20924943">spate of sexual assaults</a> near their campus.</p>
      <p>Aamer Anwar has joined <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fury-after-ex-scots-rugby-20920934">the university’s</a> student president in demanding an explanation from Police Scotland after the force was accused of putting safety at risk by not alerting the public to a rape and three other sex attacks in the city’s west end last month.</p>
      <p>On Thursday we told today how students were <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/jealous-wag-who-glassed-footballer-20924632">furious</a> after being informed of the assaults by university chiefs several weeks later.</p>

      <p>In a joint letter to Chief Constable Iain Livingstone and his assistant Stevie Johnson, human rights lawyer Anwar, who was appointed university rector in 2017, and student president Scott Kirby asked for a copy of the protocol on alerting the public to such crimes.</p>
      <p>It said: “Police Scotland now stand accused of putting the safety of students as well as our staff at risk and accordingly we seek an explanation as to the basis of the delay and why no information was sought from the students/staff at our University.”</p>
      <p>Two sexual assaults took place in Lawrence Street, Partick, and Napiershall Street, North Woodside, on October 17, followed by a third on Cranworth Street, Hillhead, on October 24.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A 34-year-old man has been charged in connection with the three incidents.</p>
      <p>A week later, a 20-year-old victim was raped in Sutherland Lane, near the university library, in the early hours of October 31.</p>
      <p>The letter to police demanded more information on the attacks and said it “beggars belief” that no appeal was made after the fourth incident was reported.</p>
      <p>It said: “The information provided to date has been of an extremely limited nature, leaving some of our students and staff frightened.</p>
      <p>“Whilst such attacks are rare, you will appreciate that four attacks in the space of a month is one that quite rightly has caused real concerns.”</p>
      <p>Warnings surrounding the four incidents were issued by the university for the first time on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Uni chiefs say they acted as soon as they were informed of all the assaults by police.</p>
      <p>The university said it has appealed to staff and students to share any concerns or information by contacting its security team or Police Scotland.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland said: “In every serious crime reported to police, officers carefully consider whether or not it is appropriate to proactively make the circumstances public.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“This is continually assessed throughout the investigation to ensure the safety of victims and the wider public is protected.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to liaise with Glasgow University and the surrounding communities as part of our continued investigations into this.”</p>
