      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- The Pentagon identified Thursday two U.S. service members who died earlier in the week in a helicopter crash in <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/War_in_Afghanistan/?tps=1">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
      <p>The Department of Defense said Chief Warrant Officer 2 David C. Knadle, 33, from Tarrant, Texas, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kirk T. Fuchingami JR., 25, from Keaau, Hawaii, died Wednesday when their helicopter crashed while providing security to ground troops in Logan Province.</p>
      <p>"The incident is under investigation," the Department of Defense said in <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2022455/dod-identifies-army-casualties/source/GovDelivery/">a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>Both soldiers were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, 1st Air Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, in Fort Hood, Texas.</p>
      <p>"First Attack is saddened by the tragic loss of Chief Warrant Officer 2 David C. Knadle and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr.," Lt. Col. Adam Camarano, commander of the 1-227th Attack Reconnaissance Battalion, said in <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/11/21/army-ids-warrant-officers-killed-afghanistan-helicopter-crash.html">a statement</a>. "Our heartfelt condolences go to both families and their friends during this difficult time. [They] will always be remembered as a part of brave Cavalry troopers who have laid down their lives in defense of freedom."</p>
      <p>NATO's mission in Afghanistan Resolute Support said Wednesday that preliminary reports do not indicate that the cause of the crash was enemy fire.</p>
      <p>With their deaths, the death toll for U.S. service members in Afghanistan for 2019 rose to at least 19 after Sgt. 1st Class <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/09/18/Pentagon-identifies-Green-Beret-killed-in-Afghanistan/9501568782953/?upi_ss=%22Jeremy+W.+Griffin%22">Jeremy Griffin</a> died by small arms fire while engaged in combat in September.</p>
      <p>It is the highest number of U.S. military casualties in the Middle Eastern country since 2014.</p>
      <p>Over 2,400 U.S. service members have died in the Middle Eastern country since the war started in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks.</p>
      <p>There are approximately 13,000 U.S. troops currently stationed in Afghanistan.</p>
