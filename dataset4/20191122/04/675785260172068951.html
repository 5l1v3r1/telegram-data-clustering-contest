      <h2>The 22-year-old was killed by the defendant after returning to his hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand, last December after meeting him on Tinder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:46:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:46</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A 27-year-old man has been found guilty of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane after a Tinder date in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was killed by the defendant when she returned to his hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand, last December.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed he deliberately strangled her, although the man argued that Grace died accidentally during rough sex.</p>
      <p>Auckland High Court heard how the man Googled 'flesh-eating birds' and 'are there vultures in New Zealand' as he researched how to dispose of her body.</p>
      <p>He then bought two suitcases and stuffed her body into one of them, before burying it in a shallow grave outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The defendant also arranged another Tinder date while Grace lay dead in his hotel room.</p>

      <p>His defence team said he panicked after finding Grace dead in his room and buried her body because he did not think anyone would believe he was innocent of murder.</p>
      <p>Grace's parents have sat in court over the past three weeks listening to the harrowing details of their daughter's death.</p>
      <p>Just before the verdict came in the judge was asked a question by the jury, who asked for clarity around the sustained pressure to the neck during her death.</p>
      <p>That indicated that a decision would be imminent.</p>
