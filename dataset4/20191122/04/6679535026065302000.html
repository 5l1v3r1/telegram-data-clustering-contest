      <p>As the internet is slowly being revived across Iran after a days-long, government-imposed shutdown amid demonstrations, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called on Iranians to send the U.S. videos “documenting the regime’s crackdown on protestors”.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pompeo’s tweet early Friday comes as pockets of Iran saw internet over landlines restored.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said the internet may be entirely restored soon, suggesting Iran’s government put down the demonstrations that began Nov. 15 over government-set gasoline prices rising.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International says protest unrest and a subsequent security crackdown killed at least 106 people. Iran disputes that figure without offering its own. A U.N. office earlier said it feared the unrest may have killed “a significant number of people.”</p>
