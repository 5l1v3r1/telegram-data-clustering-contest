      <p>Arsenal are back in Premier League action tomorrow.</p>
      <p>And boy do they need three points.</p>
      <p>A game against Souithampton represents a perfect opportunity to end a run of four games without victory.</p>
      <p>But defeat against a struggling Saints side would plunge Unai Emery further into despair, with questions marks already hanging over his head about his future.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the game we take a look at the biggest stories from around Arsenal Football Club in the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Double injury blow</h3>
      <p>Unai Emery will have a bit of a selection dilemma when it comes to the team on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have done reasonably well with injuries so far this season.</p>

      <p>But the international break has brought up a few issues for the Gunners head coach.</p>
      <p>And there are question marks over one player who was missing prior to the international break too.</p>

      <h3>Granit Xhaka talks</h3>
      <p>Swiss international Granit Xhaka has been out of the side since falling out with the Arsenal fans and being stripped of the captaincy following the draw with Crystal Palace last month.</p>
      <p>But could he make his return to the Arsenal first team this weekend, or in the coming weeks?</p>

      <h3>Lineup vs Southampton</h3>
      <p>Emery will have a number of decisions to make ahead of the game with Southampton.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have not won in their last four Premier League games and find themselves eight points adrift of the Champions League places as a result.</p>

      <h3>Emery failure</h3>
      <p>Most Arsenal fans will tell you that Unai Emery failed in his first season at the club.</p>
      <p>The task for the Spaniard was to qualify for the Champions League and a poor run of form at the end of the season scuppered that.</p>
      <p>Things have not gone well at the start of this season, either, with the Gunners eight points adrift of the top four.</p>

      <p>We took a look at the data behind what happened under Wenger and what's gone on so far in Emery's reign.</p>
