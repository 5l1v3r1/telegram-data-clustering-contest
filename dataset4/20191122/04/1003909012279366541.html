      <p>He didn’t come in on a Maserati, but Tuffy the horse found his way down the old town road and into a Calgary hotel Thursday evening, keeping alive a 72-year tradition dating to the 1940s.</p>
      <p>Horses typically don’t belong in hotel lobbies or bars, but the well-behaved steed accompanied by the Calgary Grey Cup Committee strolled through the Hilton Garden on 4th Street S.E. before stopping at the King Eddy for a quick pint.</p>
      <p>“It was a very smooth check-in — hopefully there’s no horseplay in the lobby later,” Mike Kalyn, front desk manager for the hotel, said with a smile moments after helping get Tuffy in his own ‘hotel room stable.’</p>
      <p>“Incidentals were being paid for in carrots and barley.”</p>

      <p>It kept alive a tradition begun in 1948 when Calgary Stampeders fans attending the 36th Grey Cup in Toronto brought a horse into that city’s Royal York Hotel.</p>
      <p>Since then, the tale of Tuffy has become larger than life, as the Calgary contingent has made a yearly event of parading a horse through a host city hotel.</p>
      <p>“Wherever we go, we bring the western spirit of the Grey Cup week,” said Sandy Dubyk, spokeswoman for the committee. “It was a mystery for a long time (which local hotel would be chosen) with just an inside circle that knew.</p>
      <p>“But it’s definitely grown. I would say over the past seven years when it was the 100th Grey Cup, it really exploded thanks to social media.”</p>

      <p>Fletcher Armstrong, past-chairman of the committee, sat atop Tuffy as he munched on carrots and apples. Not far behind, <a href="https://nationalpost.com/sports/football/cfl/simmons-history-of-oskee-wee-wee-and-what-does-it-all-mean/wcm/ef6719d4-c0af-4a06-84bb-a933325cc598?video_autoplay=true">Hamilton Tiger-Cats fans sang their “Oskee Wee Wee” fight song</a> as they sipped on cold pints provided by the hotel bar.</p>
      <p>Tuffy, however, didn’t seem to mind as he posed for photos in front of a throng of journalists and television cameras. And as the crowd cleared out, he got a bagpiped escort to the nearby King Eddy, whose staff welcomed him with open arms.</p>
      <p>Dubyk said things ran smoothly for the horse.</p>
      <p>“You could see that grin there — Tuffy loved it,” he said. “He loves the people, he loves the attention (and is) a bit of a media hog.</p>
      <p>“I think he did great this year.”</p>
