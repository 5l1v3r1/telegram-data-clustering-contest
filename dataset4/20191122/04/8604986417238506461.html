      <p>If you need a quality pair of wireless headphones with solid battery life, the Beats Solo3 are a great choice. There are certainly headphones that sound better, and you can similarly-priced models with noise-cancellation, but at<b> </b>$170 off at Target, you won't find a better deal. </p>
      <h3>XBox One Star Wars Bundle - $350 (Best Buy)</h3>
      <p>There's a similar deal at Target, but this one's better. Save $150 off this deal which includes the full-game download of <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Deluxe Edition</i>, a month of EA access, the Xbox One X 1TB console, and an Xbox wireless controller, along with a month of Xbox Live Gold.</p>
      <h3>Apple Watch Series 3 - $129 (Walmart)</h3>

      <p>Apple kept the Series 3 around as a lower-cost option, and it's a steal this Black Friday for $70 off at Walmart. You can actually get the deal as early as Wednesday at 10 p.m. EST online, and on Thanksgiving day in-store. This one doesn't include the EKG feature, or the always-on display, but aside from also being a little smaller overall, it's a great deal on the most popular smartwatch you can get.</p>
      <h3>iPhone 11 - Free (when you buy an iPhone 11 Pro from Verizon)</h3>
      <p>If you're looking for a great deal on the latest iPhone models, Verizon is offering a buy one/get one style deal that includes a free iPhone 11 when you buy an iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max. If you don't need two new phones, Best Buy is offering up to $500 off the iPhone 11 Pro with activation and a trade-in.</p>
      <h3>Samsung 70" Class 4K Smart TV - $1,499 (Best Buy)</h3>
      <p>Saving $500 on a flagship 4K Smart TV is a pretty good deal. Of course, if you don't need something quite that large, Best Buy has a slew of Samsung LED TVs on sale for Black Friday. </p>
      <p>Target also has a Samsung 65" Smart 4K UHD HDR TV for $300 off, making it a sweet $599 deal starting on Thanksgiving day.</p>
      <h3>Amazon Echo Dot - $22 (Amazon)</h3>

      <p>If you're ready to take the smart speaker plunge, you can save $27.99 on the Amazon Echo Dot, or get a set of three for $64.97. The Dot isn't the world's most amazing-sounding speaker, but Amazon's most recent version is a marked improvement in that area. You can also save $25 off the Echo Dot with Clock if you'd rather not have to always ask for the time.</p>
      <h3>10.2" iPad - $249.99 (Target &amp; Walmart)</h3>
      <p>Apple's base model of its iconic tablet is $80 off for Black Friday. Running iPadOS and now compatible with the Smart Folio Keyboard, the 10.2" iPad is not only a great tablet, it's a great deal at both Target and Walmart.</p>
      <h3>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 - $599 (Best Buy)</h3>
      <p>You can get Microsoft's newest Surface Pro for $360 off, or get a bundle that includes the Type Cover and pen and save $429.99. That's a pretty good deal especially if you're looking at getting Microsoft's 2-in-1 device for a graduating student, or just for your own personal computing needs.</p>
      <h3>iTunes &amp; App Store Gift Cards - Save 20% (Amazon)</h3>
      <p>In addition to offering a ton of deals, especially on Amazon products, one of the best deals you can get on the site for Black Friday is a 20 percent discount on gift cards at many of the places you love to shop. That includes Apple iTunes and App Store, as well as popular restaurants like Applebees.</p>
