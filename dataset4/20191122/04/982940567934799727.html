      <h2>"Will you die if you don't eat onions?"</h2>

      <p>Onions are an important ingredient used in most South Asian dishes and its price is a very sensitive issue. In countries like India and Bangladesh, shortages can trigger a nationwide outcry leading to political pressure. As the onion crisis soared in Bangladesh in November with delays in traditional import and prices increasing six-fold, the government has announced that it is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/18/bangladesh-organises-onion-airlift-prices-hit-record-high/">air lifting onions</a> to meet the demand.</p>

      <h3>How did we get here?</h3>
      <p>Bangladesh <a href="https://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=224518">produced</a> more than 2.33 million metric tons of onions from 2018-2019 (July-June); however, the market demand is 3.6 million metric tons. The country imports onions to cover this shortage from neighboring India which <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/a-problem-of-plenty-indias-onion-mess/articleshow/71546979.cms">produces</a> almost one-fourth of the world's onions.</p>
      <p>This September, India <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/india-modi-governments-onion-export-ban-a-knee-jerk-reaction/a-50643584">banned</a> the export of onions because of reduced domestic production due to excessive rainfall and soaring local demands. Local experts <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/a-problem-of-plenty-indias-onion-mess/articleshow/71546979.cms?from=mdr">termed this</a> a knee-jerk response which does not resolve the problem but rather hurts the farmers.</p>
      <p>However, this has a huge impact on Bangladesh as it also had poor domestic production this year. As India stopped export, Bangladesh looked elsewhere for their onion imports. Initially, the traders did not go for <a href="https://bdnews24.com/business/2019/11/16/whos-to-blame-as-onion-prices-shoot-through-the-roof-in-bangladesh">imports in large margins</a>, thinking that India would lift the ban soon. Instead, some traders stockpiled onions creating an artificial crisis.</p>

      <p>In September, the price of onion was Bangladeshi Tk. 45-50 (USD 50-60 cents) per kilogram. It rose to Tk. 110-120 (USD 1.30 – 1.40) in October and in November it hit the roof at Bangladeshi Tk. 250 (USD 3).</p>

      <p>During a visit to India in the first week of October, the Bangladeshi Prime Minister <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/bangladesh-pm-hasina-jokes-she-s-had-to-cut-onions-from-her-menu-11570214204764.html">jokingly complained about</a> the onion ban to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that she’s had to cut onions from her menu. Despite repeated <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bangladesh-minister-urges-indian-government-to-lift-ban-on-onion-exports/articleshow/71715698.cms">requests</a> from Bangladesh, India did not withdraw the ban and there is an indication that the ban may last a <a href="http://www.newagebd.net/article/91094/india-likely-to-extend-onion-export-ban">few more months</a>.</p>
      <p>Onion is a perishable item, consignments from far away countries often rot on the way. So India remains the most viable option for import. Now Bangladesh is forced to buy onions from other nations such as <a href="https://www.kalerkantho.com/online/business/2019/11/17/840214">China and Egypt</a>, and they are importing via air cargo from <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/govt-fly-onion-abroad-next-week-1827571">Egypt, Turkey</a> and <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2019/11/20/airlifted-onion-from-pakistan-lands-in-dhaka">Pakistan</a> to meet the immediate crisis.</p>

      <h3>Artificial Crisis</h3>
      <p>Onion used to comprise only a small portion of the monthly food expenditures of Bangladeshi households. However, the price increase has hurt the lower middle class and poor households. The government has <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/20/c_138568585.htm">launched </a>subsidized price onion outlets to stabilize the market and a lot of people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DpRQg7AHXE">flocked</a> to the selling points.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Many blamed the traders for creating an artificial crisis. Different government agencies fined and <a href="https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/article/1622544">jailed</a> more than 2,000 traders in the past two months for stockpiling onions or selling at a higher price than the market price.</p>

      <p>To address the crisis, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recently <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/country/news/food-cooked-pms-residence-without-onion-1828252">told media</a> that her meals are being cooked without onion and the result is “tasty and delicious”.

        <blockquote>Onion is not an absolute necessity like clothes. Not basic rights. [..] Many Bengali food items are prepared without onion or you can use at a lesser quantity. Even you can make food tasty without onion.<br/><br/>If your monthly consumption of onion has come down to half from 5 kilograms because of the crisis, then you know that this is the correct demand. You were overusing onion till now.</blockquote>

      <p>Meanwhile, some netizens reacted to the onion crisis using innovative and funny memes such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gujob.comm/photos/a.388385981560779/921237684942270/">this</a>:</p>

      <p>Despite the jokes being shared online, the seriousness of the issue should not be forgotten as political parties are using the crisis as a rallying point. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party">Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)</a> largest opposition party, blamed the government for the hike and <a href="http://www.newagebd.net/article/90882/bnp-to-rally-countrywide-against-onion-price-hike">called</a> for a countrywide rally in protest. There was also a <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/onion-crisis-artificial-1827313">heated debate</a> in the parliament about it.</p>
