      <p><b>WASHINGTON – </b>The first comic book produced by Marvel, the famed U.S. publisher behind Spider-Man, X-Men and The Avengers, went under the hammer Thursday, fetching a record $1.26 million, Heritage Auctions said.</p>
      <p>“This is a historic copy of a historic comic book,” Ed Jaster, auction house senior vice president, said of the book, which was published in 1939 by Timely Comics, which later became Marvel.</p>
      <p>“Without question, this is the granddaddy of all Marvel Comics, without which we would not have the characters and stories we enjoy in today’s comics and feature films,” Jaster added.</p>
      <p>Under the direction of screenwriter Stan Lee, Marvel in the 1960s created superheroes that have become iconic today and whose cinema adaptations have conquered box offices worldwide.</p>
      <p>The first copy of Marvel Comics was sold in very good condition and well above the price of 10 cents it fetched back in 1939.</p>
      <p>Amazing Fantasy #15, in which Spider-Man first appears, slipped to second-highest Marvel comic ever auctioned, having sold for $1.1 million in 2011.</p>
      <p>The most expensive comic book in history remains the first issue of Action Comics published in 1938 in which Superman makes his debut. It sold for $3.2 million in 2014.</p>
