      <p>CAIRO (AP) — The U.N. migration agency says the bodies of at least six migrants were found on Libya’s Mediterranean coast.</p>
      <p>The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration tweeted that the bodies were found near the Libyan port of al-Khums on Friday. The organization says another 90 migrants were intercepted by the Libyan coast guard.</p>
      <p>Libya has emerged as a major transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe. Most migrants make the perilous journey in ill-equipped and unsafe rubber boats.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the EU has partnered with Libya’s coast guard and other local groups to stem the dangerous sea crossings.</p>
      <p>Rights groups, however, say those policies leave migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers rife with abuses.</p>
