      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday filed fresh charges against James Nolan, a Briton, at the Federal High Court, Abuja.</p>
      <p>The EFCC’s Counsel, Ekele Iheanacho, had, at the resumed trial, told Justice Okon Abang that the anti-graft agency had filed an amended charge, dated November 20.</p>
      <p>The lawyer said the EFCC was bringing up a 32-count charge against the defendants in the case, contrary to the initial 16-count charge bordering on money laundering.</p>

      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that EFCC had, on October 21, arraigned Nolan and Adam Quinn (said to be on the run), both British nationals, for their alleged complicity in the $9.6 billion judgment against Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Process and Industrial Development (P&amp;ID), an Irish engineering company, had secured the award against Nigeria following the non-execution of a 20-year gas and supply processing agreement (GSPA) the company had with the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>The arraignment of the two British nationals is coming weeks after two P&amp;ID directors were convicted over the deal.</p>
      <p>The defendants are both directors of Goidel Resources Limited, a Designated Non-Financial Institution (DNFI) and ICIL Limited.</p>
      <p>The 32-count charge was read to Mr Nolan by the court registrar.</p>
