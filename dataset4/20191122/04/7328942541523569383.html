      <h1>Tesla's Stainless Steel Futuristic Cybertruck Has Arrived</h1>
      <h2>Tesla's all-electric truck comes amid new competition.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:47:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:47</time> by <a rel="author">Donna Fuscaldo</a></address>
      <p>It’s official. After months of speculation and hype on the part of <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/elon-musk-innovator-and-engineer">Elon Musk</a>, Tesla rolled out its sixth electric vehicle the Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck.</p>
      <p>Musk unveiled the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#battery">Cybertruck</a> at an event at Tesla's design studio which shares the same property as the SpaceX headquarters.</p>
      <p>The truck had initially been slated to be revealed earlier this year but Tesla announced this fall it would be delayed until November.</p>

      <h3>Tesla prices Cybertruck for the masses</h3>
      <p>Calling it a "monoplane" design the truck's body is made of super hard stainless steel that Musk demonstrated isn't penetrable. During the event, different objects were lodged at the truck with nary a scratch. There was that moment when designer Franz Von Holzhausen threw a metal ball to the truck and shattered the window. The ball didn't make it through the glass.</p>

      <p>Musk even went as far as to say the body was resistance to a<b> 9 mm</b> handgun. The truck has a towing capacity of <b>14,000 pounds</b>, has <b>110v</b>/<b>220v</b> on-board outlets, full-self driving and auto-park among other features.</p>

      <p>The futuristic pick-up can seat up to six passengers and gets <b>500 miles</b> on a charge. The truck has all the fixings including dual-motor all-wheel drive, cameras around the car and the ability to park itself. </p>

      <p>The Cybertruck comes in three versions starting at <b>$39,900</b> for a single motor Cybertruck. A dual motor version costs <b>$49,900</b> while a tri-motor model goes for <b>$69,900</b>.</p>
      <p>Musk has previously described the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/volvo-starts-selling-electric-trucks-for-urban-transport">electric truck</a> as something straight out of the movie Blade Runner and he wasn’t joking. Fans reacted favorably to the new addition to the Tesla lineup. To end the show on a high note, Tesla brought out an electric RV that fits in the trunk of the Cybertruck and charges on the go.</p>

      <h3>Electric truck competition mounting</h3>
      <p>It’s still too early to tell if Tesla will have a hit on its hands but one thing is for sure, it's facing more competition on the EV truck front. On Sunday Ford announced the all-electric <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/electric-face-off-tesla-model-y-vs-ford-mustang-mach-e">Mustang Mach-E</a>. The SUV, which Ford unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show, aims to blend style and space. <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/rivian-may-not-be-the-tesla-killer-some-are-predicting">Rivian</a>, the electric truck startup is also working on an all-electric truck that's priced at more than <b>$65,000</b>.</p>
