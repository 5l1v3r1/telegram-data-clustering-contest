      <h1>Coach Igor Stimac needs time and support to deliver</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:10:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Marcus-Mergulhao-479195787.cms" target="_blank">Marcus Mergulhao</a></address>
      <p>PANAJI: In the 81st minute of India’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/FIFA-World-Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> 2022 qualifier against Oman, Igor Stimac’s side showed its true colours.</p>
      <p>For long spells India were on the back foot. There was no method to what they were doing, and Ali Habsi, Oman’s Premier League goalkeeper, had hardly anything to do. Then, suddenly there was a spark. Ashique Kuruniyan, Brandon Fernandes and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sunil-chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a> all played the ball so slickly amongst themselves that Oman watched in amazement. You could sense that Habsi was alert, but India gave the ball away so cheaply that they almost got caught out on the counter.</p>
      <p>In almost every game, there have been flashes of brilliance. In the opener against Oman in Guwahati, there was much more. But for all that the World Cup bronze medallist gets his team to do, there is nothing much to show in terms of results, the currency in which success of a coach is measured.</p>

      <p>Statistically, in 10 games since the Croatian took charge, India have won just once. But it’s worth listening to what he has to say, or what the finer numbers actually detail. India have looked much more confident with the ball at their feet than they ever did, the average passes per game has jumped from 242 at the Asian Cup 2019 early this year to 392 per game now, and there is a pass accuracy of 82 percent, far better than what India did earlier. India in fact enjoyed more ball possession than Oman in Muscat but didn’t have a worthy-enough shot on goal.</p>
      <p>These are all stats, numbers, though the only figure that fans look at – one win from 10 games – would stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
      <p>“As I always mention, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/FIFA-World-Cup">football</a> is a process and specially it’s hard with the national team which is not operating like a club on a daily basis to do certain things and change certain things with six days of training sessions we are provided,” said Stimac.</p>
      <p>Since Stimac took over the Indian football team in late May, India has had some encouraging results: a win against Thailand, draws with Syria and Qatar. But it is the loss of points against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the World Cup qualifiers that seems to have started a debate. Had India won those two games — a matter of should rather than could — Stimac would have so easily been hailed a genius for drawing Qatar and then losing by a fighting one-goal margins against Oman.</p>
      <p>“Changes don’t happen overnight. There is a process,” explains Stimac, seeking time and support.</p>
      <p>Luck has not been favourable too. Players like Amarjit Singh, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sandesh-Jhingan">Sandesh Jhingan</a> and Rowllin Borges would have had an impact, but they are all nursing injuries. Jeje Lalpekhlua has watched from the sidelines for a long time now and newcomers like Manvir Singh and Farukh Chaudhary have not been able to measure up to the challenge. All, though, is not lost. Should India win their last two games against Bangladesh and Afghanistan they will almost certainly finish third and remain in contention for a place in the Asian Cup 2023. That’s the real target.</p>
