      <p>Clotet was asked about the veteran’s form but kept his cards very close to his chest.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t decided the team yet, I have a few ideas in my mind, not relating to the goalkeeper, we had a very good training with two teams, ten v ten or 11 v 11 working on game scenarios.</p>
      <p>“We are working on game scenarios one team is losing 2-0, the other team is losing 2-0, how does that team do?</p>

      <p>“After training I have to think about what I have been watching because I saw some really good things when it comes to partnerships and things.</p>
      <p>“I always do that, tonight and tomorrow, we decide the team, I check with the staff and then I take a decision.</p>
      <p>“As a ‘keeper I think Lee Camp had a solid start to the season and I obviously understand the fans are worried because if the goalkeeper makes a mistake it normally ends up in a goal.</p>

      <p>“If a striker makes a mistake and doesn’t score the goal we don’t blame him for results, probably we should. We would have won that if we had scored.</p>
      <p>“What I can say to the fans is everyone here is very focused on correcting mistakes, on improving on helping us to get better and building.</p>
      <p>“We are not naive that the only thing is to build, to build, the importance is to finish as well as possible as well as build the club - that’s my motivation. Tomorrow I will decide."</p>

      <p>Remember him?</p>
      <p>Viv Solomon-Otabor admits he made a slow start to his career with CSKA Sofia but is now ready to ‘excel’.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Instagram account EaglesTracker, the 23-year-old said delays over his future in the summer transfer window meant he was playing catch up with his new club.</p>
      <p>The winger <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/departed-star-could-set-birmingham-16550107">turned down a new contract at Blues</a> and instead moved to Bulgaria’s top tier efbet League.</p>
      <p>He made his debut on July 20, played 13 minutes of Sofia’s Europa League qualifying campaign - but has picked up more recently.</p>
      <p>He scored his first goal for the club on October 30 and also received his first call up to the full Nigeria squad last  month.</p>
      <p>Solomon-Otabor feels he is now up and running.</p>

      <p>“It’s a different experience, playing in another country, with a different language, adapting to different styles of play, something I am not really used to. You just have to adapt,” he told <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eaglestrackerng/">Eagles Tracker</a> .</p>
      <p>“I came late because I wasn’t sure what I was going to do, stay at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham</a> , come here, go elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I wasn’t fit, I am now back to my full fitness and as time goes on I will be able to play more and more minutes and from there excel.”</p>
      <p>The  Londoner, who actually started pre-season at Blues scored twice for the club in 40 appearances, the vast majority off the bench.</p>
      <p>However, he credits Birmingham with starting his football career after being released by Crystal Palace as a boy.</p>
      <h3>Getting stronger</h3>
      <p>Pep Clotet admits Josh McEachran has surprised him with the progress he has made with his conditioning.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> caretaker head coach praised the former Brentford midfielder for his attempts to prove himself at his new club.</p>
      <p>After going through the summer as a free agent McEachran signed a two-year deal last month and has made just one first team appearance so far.</p>
      <p>Whenever he has been asked about the 26-year-old Clotet has referred to the exacting fitness levels the former Chelsea starlet needs to meet for more regular involvement.</p>

      <p>And the signs are that after a fortnight of heavy conditioning and testing, McEachran has done well and could be ready to contribute in the run-up to the festive period.</p>
      <p>“He did the test and he did very well,” Clotet said. “Actually better than expected. I had a good talk with him.</p>
      <p>“He’s putting in all the effort that he can to make sure he’s ready, so that’s good. We have a lot of games now from now until Christmas so everyone will make a difference.</p>
      <p>“It was a long time since he last played regularly. I see him very focused on using this opportunity to get back as strong as possible and he’s putting in the right steps in the right direction.”</p>

      <h3>A legend for both</h3>
      <p>Frank Worthington was a footballing icon who spanned more than two decades in professional football.</p>
      <p>The maverick striker, who scored 286 goals in 905 appearances, played for more than a dozen clubs spread across the world - and remains loved at most.</p>
      <p>Which is why his career will be celebrated this weekend at a meeting of two of his most notable former employers - Huddersfield Town and</p>
      <p>Halifax-born Worthington signed for Town in 1966 - when high blood pressure saw a move to Liverpool fall through - and scored his first goal against West Ham United in a League Cup tie in November 1967.</p>

      <p>By the time he left Huddersfield in 1972, having helped them into the top flight, he had scored 41 league goals in 171 appearances.</p>
      <p>More than 200 more came for Leicester, then on to Bolton from where Blues bought him for £150,000 in 1979.</p>
      <p>In his first season under Jim Smith Worthington also helped Blues return to Division One where they would remain as he scored 33 times in 88 matches before his departure to Leeds in 1982.</p>
      <p>He played for nearly another 20 years with clubs including Preston North End and Stockport County, as well as having a player-coach spell with Tranmere Rovers, before officially hanging up his boots in 1991.</p>
      <p>Even at 70-years-old Worthington remains a regular attendee at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>The current day Blues take on Huddersfield looking for their third away win of the season and do so five places and six spots above the 18th-placed Terriers.</p>
