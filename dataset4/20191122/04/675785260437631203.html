      <h1>Brighton boss responds to Liverpool and Man Utd transfer interest in Ben White</h1>
      <h2>Graham Potter has warned centre-back is not for sale after impressive displays on loan at Leeds attracted interest from Liverpool and Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool and Manchester United have been warned Ben White is not for sale after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> defender's impressive displays on loan at Leeds United.</p>
      <p>White has become an integral part of Marcelo Bielsa's defence at Leeds, sparking reports that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-man-utd-keen-leeds-20927811">weighing up January moves for the centre-back</a>.</p>
      <p>But Brighton manager Graham Potter says White's future is with the Seagulls - and says the south coast club are not interested in selling him.</p>
      <p>“There’s all sorts of talk as we know, but the reality is he’s our player and has a future here," Potter said of White, ahead of Brighton's Premier League clash at home to high-flying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday</p>
      <p>“He’s on loan now at Leeds and having a positive experience, and we’re delighted with that.</p>

      <p>”But we’re looking forward to having him back at the right time and we’ll go from there.</p>
      <p>“He’s our player, he’s contracted with us.”</p>
      <p>Leeds fans fear that White's form and the interest from Liverpool and Manchester United will see the defender recalled to the Amex in January, upsetting their Championship promotion push.</p>
      <p>But Potter said he is happy for the 22-year-old to see out the season at Leeds before deciding whether he is ready for Brighton's first team.</p>

      <p>“He’s having a good time at Leeds, so we’ll assess at the end of the season to see what the best thing is going forward,” said Potter.</p>
      <p>“Unless there is a real push for it we won’t call him back. He’s having a positive time at Leeds and we are well covered in that position. So, we’ll carry on with that process I think.</p>
      <p>Potter added: “As a coaching team we were aware of him when I was at Swansea, we were one of the clubs who would have tried to get him on loan if I was still there. So I know his quality.</p>
      <p>“He had a loan spell at Newport and we tracked his progress for quite some time. He’s a player we like. If you see the way he plays, he’s a player who fits our way. We want to see him playing for Brighton in future.”</p>
