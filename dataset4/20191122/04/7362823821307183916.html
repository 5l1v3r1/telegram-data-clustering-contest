      <h1>Mike Huckabee blasts MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's debate performance: 'She pretends to be a journalist'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:19:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:19</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>Former Arkansas Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/mike-huckabee">Mike Huckabee</a> said Thursday that he found something lacking in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">MSNBC</a> host Rachel Maddow's performance as a moderator during Wednesday's MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential-debate">presidential debate</a>.</p>
      <p>The Republican described Maddow as being overtly opinionated and said she showed a clear anti-Trump bias in some of her questioning.</p>
      <p>"Rachel Maddow, first of all, is about as objective as I am," Huckabee said during an appearance on Fox News' <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/ingraham-angle">"The Ingraham Angle."</a></p>

          <b>MARK LEVIN: ADAM SCHIFF IS THE 'ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO' OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>During the debate, Maddow asked Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, I-Vt., how central <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> alleged "conduct uncovered by this <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a>" should be to the Democratic presidential contenders' campaigns.</p>
      <p>She also asked Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, D-Mass., if she would try to convince Senate Republicans to convict Trump, if he is impeached by the House, and remove him from office, a sentiment Maddow said Warren has previously espoused.</p>
      <p>The "Rachel Maddow Show" host also asked former Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> about a "potential criminal investigation" against Trump after he leaves the White House.</p>
      <p>"I don't pretend to be a journalist -- I don't play one on TV," Huckabee said. "I know I have a point of view [and] she does too but she pretends to be a journalist."</p>
      <p>He added that if the federal government under a Democratic president decides Trump should be prosecuted, they will have to wait five years to do so.</p>

      <p>"By then, a lot of them are going to be so utterly discredited nobody will pay attention," he claimed.</p>
      <p>Host Laura Ingraham added that Democratic candidate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/andrew-yang">Andrew Yang</a>, a New York businessman, claimed the impeachment narrative is not working to advance the Democratic platform in regard to the presidential race.</p>
      <p>Huckabee agreed, responding that Democrats appear to hate constitutional principles more than they hold disdain for Trump.</p>
