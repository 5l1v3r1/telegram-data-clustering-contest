      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Aaditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut also urged Uddhav to be CM: Sources</li>
        <li>Uddhav, Raut to Pawar: We should stake claim ASAP</li>
        <li>Meetings of MLAs of 3 parties on Saturday if portfolios finalised</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sharad Pawar tried to convince Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to lead a Maharashtra coalition government as chief minister when they met late last night, sources said.</p>
      <p>The Sena, Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress are working on a prospective alliance after the Sena and BJP, joint winners in last month's state election, fell out bitterly. Meanwhile, Maharashtra has been placed in President's Rule.</p>
      <p>Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya went to Sharad Pawar's home in Mumbai yesterday to hold talks. Also present were Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar (Sharad Pawar's nephew) of the NCP.</p>
      <p>Like Sharad Pawar, Aaditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut, too, urged Uddhav to be chief minister.</p>
      <p>But if Uddhav Thackeray declines, Sanjay Raut will be the frontrunner, according to sources.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SENA TO PAWAR: LET'S HURRY</b>
      </p>
      <p>At last night's meeting, Uddhav Thackeray and Raut told Pawar they should stake a claim to government formation at soon as possible.</p>
      <p>If portfolios are finalised, a joint meeting of MLAs from all three alliance partners is likely on Saturday.</p>
