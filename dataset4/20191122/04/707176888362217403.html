      <h2>Active investors see their strategies automated while passive alternatives get cheaper</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:00:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ortenca Aliaj, Laurence Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>In late 2013, academics at computer-driven funds giant AQR posted online a research paper called “<a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Buffetts-Alpha">Buffett’s Alpha</a>.” The paper argued that the returns of the legendary investor could largely be explained by buying stocks that were cheap, safe and high quality — and then using debt to juice returns.</p>
      <p>The implications were potentially huge. For all the mystique surrounding the investing strategy of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5adc9520-fd7a-11e9-be59-e49b2a136b8d">Sage of Omaha</a>, much of it could apparently be replicated by a machine scanning the market for stocks displaying such characteristics. AQR launched a fund that applied this approach to a large basket of global equities.</p>
      <p>Other quant firms are joining in; London-based start-up Havelock is currently trying to fashion an algorithm that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5889bdd2-ee95-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">mimics</a> Mr Buffett. Such attempts are helping to undermine what was once a prominent feature of the investing landscape: the cult of the star stock picker.</p>
      <p>Also threatening these vaunted operators has been the decade-long equities bull market, fuelled by trillions of dollars of central bank asset purchases, which has boosted the appeal of cheap index-tracking funds. Spotting out-of-favour bargain stocks has been a duff strategy compared with buying and holding stocks already on a roll, or fast-growing technology firms.</p>
      <p>As a result, many of the former stars have been left looking decidedly ordinary.</p>
      <p>“Stock pickers just haven’t performed and that’s why investors are pulling out of active managers,” said Kevin Arenson, chief investment officer at Stenham Asset Management, which invests in hedge funds.</p>

      <p>Managers such as Fidelity’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a610faa-f5e1-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65">Jeff Vinik</a>, Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman and Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn in the US, and Woodford Investment’s Neil Woodford, Fidelity’s Anthony Bolton and Lansdowne’s Peter Davies in the UK, are among those to have developed strong followings among investors.</p>
      <p>It has been a tough few years for such marquee managers, in general. Neil Woodford’s firm is shutting down after a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f077ae2-f19e-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">high-profile scanda</a>l, Mr Davies’ flagship fund is on track for its third calendar year of losses in four, and Mr Ackman’s performance is now recovering after several years of losses.</p>
      <p>Last month stock picker Jeff Vinik became the latest star to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a610faa-f5e1-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65">throw in the towel</a>, closing his hedge fund and saying it was difficult to persuade large institutions to put money with him. Jonathon Jacobson <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47ba9fdc-201c-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65">announced</a> he was winding down his $12bn hedge fund Highfields Capital Management last year after two decades in the business.</p>
      <p>“It’s so hard,” said Kerr Neilson, founder of Sydney-based stockpicking firm Platinum Asset Management, which has A$24bn in assets. Stock pickers, who often delve in underappreciated areas of the market, would have tended to have had a smaller position in strongly-performing US stocks than passive funds and were therefore “preordained to underperform,” he said. “It’s cost us a lot of money in a relative sense.”</p>
      <p>The fees such funds can charge have been hit. The average performance fee for equity hedge funds, a loose proxy for stock pickers, has dropped from 19.1 per cent at the start of 2008 to 16.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year, according to data group HFR. That fall is roughly in line with the average for all hedge funds, but much steeper than for event-driven funds, the other strategy that focuses on stocks.</p>
      <p>Some stock pickers are now feeling like an endangered species. Just one-tenth of the US equity market’s trading volumes now comes from fundamental stock investors, with most of the rest coming from index derivatives and passive funds, according to data from JPMorgan and hedge fund Lucerne Capital. Lucerne is one of the few stock pickers to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd420d44-b3a7-11e9-8cb2-799a3a8cf37b">beat the index</a> this year, with a 43 per cent gain so far.</p>
      <p>David Scarozza, head of equities at Commonfund, an asset management firm serving non-profit organisations, said he is no longer willing to pay management fees for simple ideas he can easily access through an index. “We require an active stock picker to do more than just get us exposure to value or momentum,” he said.</p>
      <p>Other old-school managers, like Mr Einhorn, have refused to call it a day despite suffering large outflows. Greenlight’s assets have more than halved since mid-2018 to $1.8bn, regulatory filings show, after the hedge fund posted its worst ever performance last year. Five years ago it managed about $12bn.</p>
      <p>For their part, the stock pickers argue that such pressures are bound to fade over time, as simple strategies such as buying the tech sector no longer deliver.</p>
      <p>“It looks like no manager can pick stocks any more, so why not just buy the index?” said George Mussalli, chief investment officer for equities at Boston-based investment firm PanAgora Asset Management. He believes being an active manager is a “dirty term” now. “But we’re just in a cycle where large-cap has outperformed.”</p>
      <p>Platinum’s Mr Neilson concurs. “In the end you need an informed allocation of capital,” he said. “We’re safe. We’re not extinct.”</p>
