      <p>CALGARY - Brandon Banks is the CFL's outstanding player.</p>
      <p>The Hamilton Tiger-Cats receiver captured the honour for the first time Thursday at the CFL awards banquet in voting conducted by the Football Reporters of Canada and nine league head coaches.</p>
      <p>Banks, 31, led the CFL in receiving this season with a club-record 112 catches for 1,550 yards and 13 TDs. He also ran 13 times for 56 yards and a TD, returned 13 punts for 140 yards, and five missed field goals for 283 yards (56.6-yard average) and two TDs.</p>
      <p>Banks becomes the first Ticat to win the award since quarterback Danny McManus in 1998.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo was the award finalist. The first-year starter had career-highs in passing yards (4,302), rushing touchdowns (10) and touchdown passes (18), while completing 71.5 per cent of his attempts.</p>
      <p>Fajardo led Saskatchewan (13-5) to top spot in the West Division for the first time since 2009. The native of Brea, Calif., was 12-4 as a starter and had six 300-yard passing performances.</p>
