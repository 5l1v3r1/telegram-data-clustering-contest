      <p>New Delhi: Kicking off his party’s campaign for the assembly elections in Jharkhand, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a> chief Amit Shah accused the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> of stalling Ayodhya judgement and delaying a solution for the Kashmir problem for seven decades because of vote-bank politics.</p>
      <p>“Everyone wants construction of a Ram temple. We also wanted a solution to this dispute within the framework of the Constitution. Supreme Court has now cleared the way for the construction of a grand <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ram-temple">Ram temple</a> in Ayodhya,” Shah said at election rallies in Manika and Lohardagga.</p>
      <p>He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to solve all problems which have been pending for a long time in the country. He added the Centre has framed a defence policy that has protected the borders and freed the country of terrorism.</p>
      <p>Accusing the Congress of not protecting the interests of tribals during its rule, Shah recalled that it was Atal Bihari Vajpayee government which had created a separate ministry for tribals.</p>
      <p>The BJP chief said the Modi government set up a museum in the memory of tribal leaders who fought valiantly for the country's freedom.</p>
      <p>He also sought to remind the electorate that it was a BJP government which created a separate state of Jharkhand .</p>
      <p>Shah lauded the Raghubar Das government for “freeing” the state of the Naxal menace.</p>
      <p>He also praised the Das government for undertaking development works and giving the state a stable government.</p>
      <p>Appealing to voters to ensure formation of a BJP government with full majority in the state, Shah accused the Congress-JMM combine of indulging in corruption and “hoodwinking” the tribals the poor and the backward sections.</p>
