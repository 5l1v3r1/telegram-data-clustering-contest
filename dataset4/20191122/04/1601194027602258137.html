      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>RAW Superstars Zelina Vega and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/lana">Lana </a>recently got into a Twitter feud after the latter took exception to Vega calling herself the best dressed WWE talent.</p>
      <p>Zelina Vega isn't exactly known for staying silent when it comes to social media altercations with fellow Superstars. She recently posted a photo featuring herself and Andrade on her official Twitter handle, and referred to the duo as the best-dressed and best-looking talent on the roster.</p>
      <p>Fellow RAW Superstar Lana noticed the tweet and didn't seem to agree with Vega's statements. She responded by stating that her Vercase attire made her the best-dressed star on Monday Night RAW.</p>

      <p>This garnered a response from Vega, who hit back at Lana with a flaming insult. She sarcastically congratulated Lana on bagging views with her recent segments with Bobby Lashley, and added that Lana's acting is awful. Check out the tweets below:</p>
