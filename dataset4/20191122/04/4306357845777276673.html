      <h3>Willy Caballero has joked that Chelsea FC youngster Tammy Abraham has the worst taste in music of anyone at the west London club.</h3>
      <p>Abraham has been earning plenty of praise for his strong performances this season after having been given a chance to shine in the first team by Frank Lampard this term.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has repaid his manager’s faith in him by scoring 10 goals and making two assists in 12 Premier League games for the west London side this season.</p>
      <p>Abraham has also scored once and made one assist in four Champions League run-outs for Frank Lampard’s men this season.</p>
      <p>Blues goalkeeper Caballero, however, feels that the striker needs to work on his musical taste in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by Chelsea FC’s <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/21/willy-caballero-reveals-the-chelsea-player-with-the-worst-taste-?cardIndex=0-0">website</a>, Caballero said: “For the worst taste, I’d have to say Tammy Abraham!</p>
      <p>“He puts music on in the changing room all the time but it’s too difficult to understand for me, but for the younger lads it’s so easy.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know who has the best taste in music, I’d probably say Marcos [Alonso]. He plays a lot of Spanish music, a little bit of reggaeton and just music that will create a lot of fun in the changing room.</p>
      <p>“For me, it has to be bands like Oasis, U2 and Guns N’ Roses.”</p>
      <p>Abraham will be hoping to start for Chelsea FC when the Blues return to Premier League action with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The west London side head into the game after having won their last six games in the top flight to help them move up to third place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC finished in third place in the Premier League last season.</p>
