      <h1>GMB presenter Charlotte Hawkins reveals ups and downs of working with Piers Morgan</h1>
      <h2>While the rest of us try to blank him out or spend our mornings shouting at the telly as he presents Good Morning Britain, think of poor Charlotte.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rick Fulton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rick-fulton/</a></address>
      <p>Charlotte Hawkins has revealed she “quite frequently” feels like throttling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/piers-morgan">Piers Morgan</a>.</p>
      <p>While the rest of us try to blank him out or spend our mornings shouting at the telly as he presents <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/itv">Good Morning Britain</a>, think of poor Charlotte.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old newsreader sometimes struggles to do her job as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/peirs-morgan">Piers</a>, 54, butts in and rants as the mood takes him.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly Charlotte said: “Quite frequently I want to strangle him or resort to physical violence. I’m very tempted to give him a little kick under the desk.</p>
      <p>“I have been quite close several times.”</p>
      <p>Regardless of your feelings about Piers, most viewers can’t deny <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/itv">GMB</a> is a perkier way to wake up nowadays.</p>

      <p>As Piers grandstands, his co-host Susanna Reid, Charlotte and the others who make up the team roll their eyes and basically try to keep up with the purple-faced whirlwind.</p>
      <p>The usually serene Charlotte snapped last month and told <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/piers">Piers</a> to “zip it” when he questioned the truth of a Brexit story as “breaking news”.</p>
      <p>She laughed: “The only thing I need are ear plugs. Most of the time.</p>
      <p>“You never know what to expect day-to-day with Piers.”</p>
      <p>While he annoys vasts chunks of the UK, Charlotte enjoys the seat-of-the-pants feel to the new-look GMB.</p>
      <p>She said: “Whether viewers love or hate Piers, they tune in to see what on earth he’s going to say or do next.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Of course he’s probably very different in real life. Charlotte lets that sink in.</p>
      <p>“No, he’s as frustrating in real life really,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But we all get on really well and I feel very lucky.”</p>
      <p>This week Piers reignited his spat with BBC Breakfast claiming the rival had lost 201,000 viewers in a year, while they had put on 76,000 and the ratings were the closest they’d ever been.</p>
      <p>BBC Breakfast is still very much in front with an average audience of 1.44million compared with GMB’s 726,000.</p>
      <p>Charlotte said: “Fingers crossed we will overtake the BBC. We are heading in the right direction.”</p>
      <p>She said: “We want to offer something different. Gone are the days of just delivering the news.</p>
      <p>"Nice to have a conversation and provoke people and make sure people are engaged with the news.”</p>

      <p>Also making the headlines is GMB co-anchor Kate Garraway, 52, currently in the Australian jungle on I’m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!</p>
      <p>She’s spent much of the time screaming and making us laugh – especially in Monday night’s Bushtucker Trial when she and Caitlyn Jenner were suspended in boxes filled with 50,000 crawlies and more than 20 rats.</p>
      <p>Kate spent most of the trial trying to keep insects from her “noo-noo”.</p>
      <p>Kate laughed: “She’s doing brilliantly and we are all very proud of her at GMB.”</p>
      <p>Charlotte has also dipped her toe into the reality world – sashaying on to Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
      <p>Teamed with Brendan Cole, she was the fourth to be eliminated.</p>
      <p>Going on Strictly made her realise the best way to stimulate her mind was daily exercise – whether that be a jog or playing with her four-year-old daughter Ella Rose with hubby Mark Herbert.</p>
      <p>She also likes to listen to classical music.</p>
      <p>The thought of listening to Brahms rather than Piers Morgan certainly makes sense.</p>
      <p>Chatting at the Royal Albert Hall in London, a perfect setting when talking about her latest cinema project with the King of Waltz, Andre Rieu, Charlotte said: “I know if I’ve had a busy day in the GMB studios newsoom I can go home and play some classical music.</p>
      <p>"It’s just the tonic.”</p>
      <p>Her childhood home was filled with classical music courtesy of her father who was a clergyman at Chichester Cathedral.</p>
      <p>She said: “He’d have classical music blaring out when he was doing the dishes. The louder the better.”</p>

      <p>Now she has reconnected with her past and presents a Sunday afternoon show on Classic FM as well as her ongoing work with Andre, which began when he asked her to host his concert in Maastricht in 2011.</p>
      <p>Andre will celebrate his 70th birthday with new film 70 Years Young and Charlotte will chat to the Dutch violinist and conductor of the Johann Strauss Orchestra about his life and times.</p>
      <p>While they have worked together for eight years and Charlotte can play the piano, violin, classical guitar and flute, there is no chance Andre will let her anywhere near his orchestra.</p>
      <p>She said: “Early on when I started working with him, I thought it might be lovely to be part of the orchestra in one of the films so I asked him if he’d ever consider it and he said ‘No’. Not even to play the triangle.</p>
      <p>"You have to be an exceptional musician to be in his orchestra.”</p>
      <p>While the January cinema date is a perfect hangover cure for Hogmanay and a great way to ease your way into 2020, Charlotte also sees Andre as offering classical music to as many people as possible.</p>
      <p>She is in awe of Andre and fellow violinist Nicola Benedetti who through her Foundation is offering orchestral workshops to young players.</p>
      <p>Charlotte said: “Hats off to her. I’d love to do a Nicola film.</p>
      <p>"I have the utmost respect for her and for Andre.</p>
      <p>"They have bucketloads of talent but they are also such hard workers and dedicated to keep classical music alive, reinvigorating them for future generations so they will still continue to be loved and played.”</p>
      <p>● Andre Rieu’s 70 Years Young will be screening in towns and cities around the country on January 4 and 5, 2020.</p>
