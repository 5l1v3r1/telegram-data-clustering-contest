      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner's mother was not happy with the treatment she received from Kris when she was Bruce and exploring her desires to become a woman</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:28:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner’s</a> mother has said that she is glad that she 'got away' from Kris Jenner, as she was too 'controlling'.</p>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity campmate was married to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians momager between 1991 and 2015, with 70-year-old Caitlyn saying that she was 'suppressed' from exploring her desires to become a woman.</p>
      <p>Her mother, 93-year-old Esther Jenner accused Kris of 'controlling' Caitlyn, when she was Bruce Jenner, and that Kris had made him look "unassertive and spineless."</p>
      <p>She went on to tell MailOnline that Kris "made him look like a milk-toast man."</p>
      <p>Esther has also hit out at the hit reality show that has followed the lives of the Kardashians over recent years.</p>

      <p>She said that she couldn't understand why it was such a global success and that the show was 'plotless'.</p>
      <p>Esther continued: "I wasn’t fond of that programme <i>.</i> There was no plot, and why it was such a hit I’ll never know."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn's mother has also spoken out about her transition and has said that she is happy that Caitlyn had taken the decision to do so.</p>
      <p>Esther said: "It’s nothing she asked for. It’s a condition and it starts in the mother’s womb."</p>
      <p>Despite this, Esther has admitted that she finds it hard to use the proper pronouns for Caitlyn and can still find herself referring to her as ‘he or him’.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn's mother has also spoken about what it is like for her offspring to become a household name in many different countries.</p>

      <p>Esther admitted: "When your child becomes, oh golly, world famous, it’s very difficult for a mother to put them in that category.</p>
      <p>"He’s not a celebrity to me. He’s my kid".</p>
      <p>This may be the case but Esther has admitted that she will not be watching Caitlyn's progress in the Australian jungle, saying that the ITV show is "torture".</p>
      <p>The relationship between Caitlyn and Kris has been strained since the publishing of the tell-all memoir by the former Olympic champion.</p>

      <p>Kris hit out at her former lover, saying that she had published 'lies' in the book and that it "could’ve been handled in the most amazing, loving way."</p>
      <p>She went on to say: "Talk about your journey and keep it to that.</p>
      <p>"That I would’ve had great respect for... there’s lies that are printed in a book that lives there for the end of time, so your children are going to read this book about their grandparents and have a story that’s fabricated, that’s in print, and is a fabrication."</p>
