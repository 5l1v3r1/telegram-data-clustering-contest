      <h1>Radio DJ Robin Galloway on how his raspy voice turned out to be a cancer scare</h1>
      <h2>Robin's wife and pals urged him to see a doctor after a Heart FM listener texted in commenting that his voice sounded different.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brian McIver, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/brian-mciver/</a></address>
      <p>Scots radio star Robin Galloway feared he would lose his voice for good after a raspy throat turned out to be a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/cancer-charity-host-event-offer-20930269">cancer</a> scare.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ex-celtic-star-petta-hits-20902559">DJ</a> returns to the air next week with new station Pure after undergoing surgery earlier this year for a lump on his throat – and is now hoping to raise awareness of the condition.</p>
      <p>His wife and pals urged him to see a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fury-after-ex-scots-rugby-20920934">doctor</a> after a Heart FM listener texted in commenting that his voice sounded different.</p>
      <p>Medics removed the pre-cancerous growth before it could become dangerous, giving him a clean bill of health – and he now urges anyone with the same worries to seek help.</p>
      <p>He was terrified he would lose his voice and endanger his career as one of Scotland’s best known DJs with stations such as Scot FM, Northsound, Clyde 1 and Heart FM.</p>

      <p>Robin, 57, from Aberdeen, said: “It started with a listener, who texted in and said they’d listened to me for years and my voice sounded different.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think anything of it but mentioned it to my wife and friends. I thought the best thing to do was get it checked out and thankfully I did. It wouldn’t have been good if anything else had developed. I’d urge anyone like that to go and get it sorted.</p>
      <p>“When they remove the growth, you can’t really speak properly for a couple of weeks and that is worrying when this is your stock in trade.</p>
      <p>“It does really knock your confidence and a few times before it really came back again I would go to speak and a Mickey Mouse voice came out, which is not the best.”</p>
      <p>“You’re told not to speak at all for three days. It was a bit concerning, there was this new radio station coming up and I’m thinking, ‘Am I still actually gonna be able to speak?’</p>
      <p>“But since it’s come back, I’ve noticed a massive improvement.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want any sympathy but I would honestly urge people who notice a change in their voice – it might be nothing, I’m sure it will be – to go and see their GP.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Robin went in for laser surgery to remove the nodules in July and revealed the news in an Instagram post, which ended with the words: “Speak soon. Hopefully.”</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve never smoked – I did work as a DJ in nightclubs years ago before the smoking ban which might have something to do with it but they just can’t say. They do tell you there’s always the chance that you could be left worse than you were but at the end of the day, it has to come out.</p>
      <p>“I cannot praise the doctors and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital highly enough, they are absolutely world class.</p>
      <p>“Any growth is pre-cancerous. These ones were taken off at the right time before anything was able to develop. If you didn’t know it was there or just thought it was a cold or something there’s always the chance it could develop into something else.” Robin is delighted to put his worries behind him and is looking forward to his gig with new DAB station Pure, launched by DC Thomson Media next Tuesday at 8.30am.</p>

      <p>The station is focused on music with no news and a policy of promoting more Scots artists than rival commercial stations. As the breakfast host, he has promised to get back to his outrageous best.</p>
      <p>“We’re back by public demand and some of the favourite characters are back, like Hector Brocklebank and Old Mrs Galloway.”</p>
      <p>“I believe that over the last 10 years, since I left Real Radio, I’ve lived a lie on air, that wasn’t me.</p>
      <p>“I became sanitised and allowed bosses to say, ‘This is the way to go’ and I don’t think that was me.</p>
      <p>“People are sick of radio being safe and boring. There’s not enough people listening to radio in the way they used to and people now listen to podcasts because they are daring and having a laugh.</p>
      <p>“I am absolutely sure there will be complaints and quite possibly fines but the great thing is these guys said, ‘We want you to be you.’ Fools, why do they do that...”</p>
