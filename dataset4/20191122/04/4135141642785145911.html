      <p>ST. LOUIS — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/jordan-binnington-player-stats">Jordan Binnington</a> stopped 40 shots for his sixth career shutout and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/oskar-sundqvist-player-stats">Oskar Sundqvist</a> scored twice to lead the St. Louis Blues to a 5-0 win over the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/calgary-flames-team">Calgary Flames</a> on Thursday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/zachary-sanford-player-stats">Zach Sanford</a> had a goal and three assists, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/david-perron-player-stats">David Perron</a> and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/vince-dunn-player-stats">Vince Dunn</a> also scored and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/robert-thomas-player-stats">Robert Thomas</a> added three assists to help the Blues improve to 9-1-2 in their last 12 games.</p>
      <p>David Rittich finished with 26 saves for Calgary, which has lost six in a row while being outscored 23-5.</p>
      <p>Binnington, who helped the Blues to their first Stanley Cup title last season, got his first shutout this season. His biggest save came late in the second when he halted Johnny Gaudreau on a breakaway.</p>
