      <p>BOGOTA (Reuters) - Three police were killed in a bomb blast late on Friday at a police station in Colombia, after thousands gathered for renewed protests and sporadic looting erupted in the capital Bogota.</p>

      <p>A police source told Reuters 10 officers were also injured in the explosion, in the town of Santander de Quilichao in the southwestern province of Cauca, known as a hot spot for drug trafficking and violence.</p>
      <p>The source did not attribute the bombing to a particular armed group. Police are expected to hold a news conference on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Three people were killed on Thursday as more than 250,000 people marched in a national strike to express growing discontent with President Ivan Duque’s government.</p>
      <p>Their grievances included rumored economic reforms that the president has denied and anger at what protesters call a lack of government action to stop corruption and the murder of human rights activists.</p>
      <p>Thousands gathered on Friday afternoon in Bogota’s Bolivar Plaza for a “cacerolazo” - a traditional Latin American expression of protest in which people bang pots and pans.</p>
      <p>“We are here to keep protesting against the Duque government,” said 25-year-old art student Katheryn Martinez, as she clanged a pot with a fork accompanied by her father Arturo, 55.</p>
      <p>“It’s an inefficient government that kills children and doesn’t acknowledge it,” she said, referring to a recent bombing targeted at rebels that killed eight teenagers and prompted the former defense minister to resign.</p>
      <p>The crowd, which included families and elderly people, was abruptly dispersed by tear gas, sending protesters running up the steep narrow streets of the historic district.</p>
      <p>Some protesters regrouped at nearby intersections and continued chanting, while people in other neighborhoods gathered in celebratory cacerolazos, temporarily blocking some roads.</p>
      <p>A 9 p.m. curfew is in force across Bogota, except for the neighborhoods of Bosa, Kennedy and Ciudad Bolivar, where it began at 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Posts on social media and callers into radio stations said neighbors were organizing to protect homes from looters, while officials urged calm.</p>
      <p>Several supermarkets in the city’s south were looted on Friday as protesters, many masked, burned items in the street and blocked roads. Other protesters stole a public bus.</p>
      <p>Some people were taking advantage of the protests to “sow chaos”, Duque said in a televised address on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>“From next week I will start a national conversation that will strengthen the current agenda of social policies,” Duque said.</p>
      <p>He added that dialogue would “permit us to close social gaps, fight corruption more effectively and build, between all of us, peace with legality.”</p>
      <p>The three deaths on Thursday in Valle del Cauca province were being investigated, Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told journalists on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said authorities had confirmed two deaths in Buenaventura and one in Candelaria, adding that a group of people had tried to loot the Viva Buenaventura mall.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the confrontation between vandals and security forces and in events that are the subject of investigation by the attorney general’s office, two people were killed,” he said.</p>

      <p>Though the vast majority of Thursday’s marchers participated peacefully, 98 people were arrested, while 122 civilians and 151 members of the security forces were injured, he said.</p>
      <p>Authorities launched 11 preliminary investigations into security forces’ misconduct, Trujillo added, after social media images of protesters’ rough treatment by police, including one kicked in the face.</p>
      <p>The protests have coincided with demonstrations elsewhere in Latin America, from anti-austerity marches in Chile, to protests over vote-tampering allegations in Bolivia that led President Evo Morales to resign, and inflamed tensions in Ecuador and crisis-hit Nicaragua.</p>
