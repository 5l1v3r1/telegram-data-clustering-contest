      <p>In an interview with Indian Express, Bhushan Kumar was asked about the criticism received to Yaad Piya Ki Aane Lagi. He said, “We launched this song three-four days ago and it has more than thirty million views (on YouTube). Today, many people criticize the trend of song recreation. Lalit Sen (music composer of the original song performed by Falguni Pathak) praised the re-composition. He is the best judge. If he is appreciating it, then it means that we have done a good job. So people who are criticizing the song should stop as we have made it for this generation.”</p>
      <p>Bhushan added that the original song was released long time ago and people enjoyed it. Now, many are revisiting the new version and are happy about the recreation. The T-Series head added that even if many people have criticised it, they have a large number of audience they want their song to reach.</p>
      <p>“So I am really happy with the kind of response the song has been receiving. I am very thankful to my audience,” Kumad stated.</p>
