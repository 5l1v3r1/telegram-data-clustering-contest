      <p>An elderly woman couldn’t get out of her bath for eight days and was only saved by food firm staff who became worried when they couldn’t contact her.</p>
      <p>A driver from Wiltshire Farm Foods called by and spotted a pile of post. He alerted police who broke in.</p>
      <p>Franchise owner Suzy Leeson said: “I can’t imagine how frightening it must have been.</p>
      <p>“If our driver hadn’t gone round, she might still be stuck there.”</p>
      <p>The old lady – who has not been named but is thought to be in her 70s – is recovering in hospital.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> said: “Amazingly, she was OK.”</p>
      <p>Suzy added: “We couldn’t get in touch over the phone, which was unusual. One of our customer care assistants, Dawn Jackson, was increasingly worried.</p>
      <p>"In the end, she asked one of our drivers, Lenny, to make sure she was OK.</p>
      <p>“He found a pile of post and decided to call police.”</p>
      <p>Suzy said an officer had told her the lady had managed to keep warm with an electric fire.</p>
      <p>Leicestershire Police first revealed the incident in a social media post.</p>
      <p>It said: “Really great work earlier following a concern for welfare. Officers got her out and East Midlands Ambulance were called to carry out medical assessment. Although hungry, she is OK.”</p>
