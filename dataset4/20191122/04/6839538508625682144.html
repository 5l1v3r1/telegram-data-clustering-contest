      <p>Six masked protesters have surrendered from a Hong Kong university campus, bringing to about 30 the number that have come out in the past day, surrounded by police.</p>
      <p>The group emerged from a campus entrance and held hands as they walked toward a checkpoint around 3 am on Friday.</p>
      <p>Five wore the black clothing favoured by the movement and the other was in a blue checked shirt.</p>
      <p>Most of the protesters who took over Hong Kong Polytechnic University last week have left, but an unknown number remain inside.</p>
      <p>Police are arresting all the adults. Those under 18 can go home but may face charges later.</p>
      <p>It was the latest bout in more than five months of unrest in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. Protesters are demanding fully democratic elections and an investigation into alleged police brutality in suppressing the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Anti-government rallies were held in at least two places on Thursday night. Riot peace kept watch, exchanging heated words with some, but there were no major clashes ahead of district council elections on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Protesters fear the government could cancel the elections because of the unrest. City leaders have said they want to go ahead with the vote but warn violence could make it impossible to hold a fair and safe election.</p>
