      <h1>West Brom handed January transfer boost as Aston Villa star lends a hand</h1>
      <h2>A round up of all things WBA from BirminghamLive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <h3>Gayle update</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United are prepared to listen to offers for striker Dwight Gayle in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Gayle, who scored 24 times for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> last season as they just missed out on promotion back to the Premier League via the playoffs, has struggled with a calf injury since returning to his parent club in the summer but he has made his comeback from the bench in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Albion did offer him a route back to The Hawthorns prior to the summer transfer window’s closure, but the forward sought to remain at St James’s Park as he looked to stake a claim for a starting spot under new boss Steve Bruce.</p>
      <p>Until now, though, he’s played just six minutes spanning two matches for the Magpies since his return from injury.</p>

      <h3>Battling on</h3>
      <p>West Brom’s returning star Gareth Barry might’ve retired this summer, but for the fact that he was desperate not to bring the curtain down on his decorated career through injury.</p>
      <p>Rather than holiday in the summer months of the close season, Barry, 38, returned to the club’s training ground despite the fact that his contract had expired.</p>
      <p>He worked hard in the gym after undergoing knee surgery earlier this year - an operation that brought to a premature end his season - and eventually was welcomed into Slaven Bilic’s group for regular training.</p>
      <p>The off-field red tape concerning <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> and former club Everton delayed Barry’s comeback somewhat, but the veteran midfielder is now all set for a return whenever Bilic sees fit.</p>

      <h3>Lovely gesture</h3>
      <p>Already an <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> favourite - and an England international to boot - Tyrone Mings is also doing his bit for a great cause.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions’ trip to Bulgaria last month, for a match they won 6-0, will be remembered by most for the awful racism that was aimed at England players - including debutant Mings himself.</p>
      <p>One England fan who travelled to Sofia to support his country for the first time that day was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> supporter Rob Spray.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old, who was a season ticket holder in the Brummie Road End at The Hawthorns,  died after suffering a cardiac arrest while in Bulgaria.</p>

      <h3>Opposing view</h3>
      <p>Garry Monk leads his Sheffield Wednesday side to The Hawthorns on Saturday to face a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> side who deems to be the best in the division currently.</p>
      <p>The Owls, who sit in eighth place in the Championship but who have won only one of their last five league games, are expected to challenge for promotion under Monk this term after he was appointed as the club’s new boss in September after the unexpected departure of Steve Bruce.</p>
      <p>They head to the Black Country against a backdrop of uncertainty, though, after it emerged that the club had been charged by the EFL for breaching Profitablity and Sustainability rules.</p>

      <h3>Dear oh dear</h3>
      <p>Anyone connected with football loves a good stat.</p>
      <p>Who tops the scoring and assisting charts? What’s your club’s away form like? How many clean sheets have your defenders and goalkeepers earned?</p>
      <p>‘The stats don’t lie’ is a commonly used phrase. In this modern world of analysis and extra scrutiny on performance, fitness and opposition, the numbers take a leading role at each elite football club.</p>
      <p>A starting XI made up of the best performing players in their respective positions of the Championship season so far, then, should be difficult to disagree with...shouldn't it?</p>

      <h3>View from the Owlery</h3>
      <p>The Championship is back with a bang this Saturday as <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> prepare to do battle with Sheffield Wednesday in an interesting encounter at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>The Baggies signed off with successive away wins over Stoke and Hull before the international break, which had followed successive draws at home to Barnsley and Charlton.</p>
      <p>The Owls, under the tutelage of Garry Monk, are in eighth place but have won only one of their last five games.</p>
      <p>They do, though, visit The Hawthorns with a clean bill of health.</p>

      <h3>How will West Brom get on against Sheffield Wednesday?</h3>
      <h4>0+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Albion win Draw Owls victory</p>
      <h3>Slav's decisions</h3>
      <p>Slaven Bilic has had almost two weeks to mull over it, and soon all shall be revealed.</p>
      <p>Who will the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> head coach opt for when it comes to filling the midfield chasm that has appeared in his Albion team, for one game and one game only?</p>
      <p>Bilic will be robbed of the services of Romaine Sawyers and Jake Livermore because of their respective one-match bans against Sheffield Wednesday, but we must look at the flip side of those absences.</p>
      <p>As one door closes, another opens, after all. Or, more pertinently here, as two midfielders miss out an opportunity arises for their colleagues to force Bilic’s thinking in the longer term.</p>
