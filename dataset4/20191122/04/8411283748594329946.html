      <p>Major Taiwan-based flexible PCB specialists have had their respective production lines for LCP (liquid crystal polymer) antenna boards ready for commercial runs as they are eyeing the emerging business opportunities that is coming along with the 5G establishment, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>Demand for LCP-based flexible PCBs from the 5G phone sector is expected to pick up in 2020 as LCP boards meet high speed, low signal loss transmission requirements of 5G networks, said the sources.</p>
      <p>In addition to antennas for 5G phones, LCP boards can also be used for the manufacture of antenna products for notebooks, tablets, wearables and other IoT devices, indicated the sources.</p>
      <p>Most flexible PCB makers, including Zhen Ding Technology, Flexium Interconnect and Career Technology, all have stressed that promoting LCP boards will be the focus of their sales campaigns in 2020.</p>
      <p>However, Ming-Chi Kuo<i>,</i> an analyst at TF International Securities, has said that he believes Apple will use LCP-based flexible boards if it decides to roll out 5G iPhones supporting mmWave technology.</p>
      <p>Most flexible PCB makers declined to comment on Kuo's opinion, saying that it is up to end-market device clients to choose the technology for their products, and as upstream suppliers they must be prepared for emerging trends.</p>
