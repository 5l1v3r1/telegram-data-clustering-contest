      <p>MANILA, Philippines – In another episode of confusion for Filipinos and law enforcers, President Rodrigo Duterte released another sweeping policy statement based on his mere say-so:<a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/245382-pnp-arrest-vape-users-without-duterte-executive-order"> vaping will be banned in public spaces</a>.</p>
      <p>Without an executive order or any enacted law as basis, no less than the Philippine National Police (PNP) admitted that they could not think of a case to file against arrested vape users. So far, the instructions to cops have been to place the name of the vapers in their blotter, confiscate their devices, then set them free.</p>
      <p>Local governments across the country, however, have passed their local ordinances that give basis for either arrests that could land users in jail, cash fines, or hours of community service.</p>
      <p>Here's a list of cities across the Philippines where the use of electronic cigarettes is banned in public places:</p>
