      <h1>SNP Health Secretary's future as MSP in doubt as she refuses to confirm election plans</h1>
      <h2>Under-fire minister Jeane Freeman repeatedly refused to say whether she will stand at the next Holyrood election.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>health Secretary Jeane Freeman’s future as an MSP is in “doubt” after she repeatedly refused to commit to standing for Holyrood again.</p>
      <p>Freeman, under pressure over a double hospitals crisis, said her plan for the 2021 election is a “matter for another day”.</p>
      <p>Labour MSP Monica Lennon said: “It sounds like Jeane Freeman’s future as an MSP is in doubt, but what the public really want to know is whether she is fulfilling her responsibilities as Health Secretary now.”</p>
      <p>Elected as an SNP MSP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley in 2016, Freeman was made a Minister before being promoted to Health Secretary.</p>
      <p>However, her tenure has been marked by rows over problems in the NHS she inherited from her predecessors.</p>
      <p>She intervened in the summer to block the opening of the new <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/opening-troubled-edinburgh-sick-kids-20024259">Sick Kids hospital in Edinburgh</a> amid concerns over safety.</p>

      <p>Freeman has also faced flak over the mounting problems at the £842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>As revealed by the Record, a whistleblower alleged that 26 child cancer patients had contracted water-based infections in 2017.</p>
      <p>The insider claimed that one of the children, later revealed to be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">10-year-old Milly Main</a>, had died.</p>
      <p>Freeman has described NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/health-secretary-admits-dirty-water-20923955">handling of the row as “appalling”</a> and she has turned on the board for criticising the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>The MSP has resisted calls for her resignation, but there are question over whether she will stand for re-election in 16 months' time.</p>
      <p>Asked by this newspaper whether she will definitely stand again in 2021, she said: “We are far too early to make those decisions, genuinely far too early. No, I’ve got a number of things I need to do. I need to deliver on our waiting times plan, I need to increase the pace of integration, I need to sort out the things we need to sort out in mental health.</p>
      <p>“Most importantly, I need to make sure that these families get to the truth. So that is what I am considering and that is what I am focused on. Whether or not I’m a candidate in 2021 is a matter for another day.”</p>
      <p>Asked a variation of the same question on two more occasions, she replied: “It is a matter for another day.”</p>
      <p>Pressed again, she said: “I will think about that nearer the time.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It came as Nicola Sturgeon pledged to parents grieving after the death of youngsters at the QEUH that there will be “no stone unturned” in their quest for answers.</p>
      <p>The First Minister expressed her “deepest condolences” to the families whose children had died amid concerns over water contamination at the super-hospital.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon also said there was a “strong case” for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to be put into “special measures”, with the Scottish Government increasing its level of involvement in the board.</p>
      <p>Scottish Tory MSP Miles Briggs said: “Given her botched handling of this latest hospital deaths scandal, it’s no wonder Jeane Freeman is considering her position.</p>
      <p>“And for the good of Scotland’s NHS, she should resign as health secretary immediately regardless of whether or not she stands in 2021.”</p>
