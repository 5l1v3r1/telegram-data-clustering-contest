      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past three sessions, there was a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-btc-price-diving-gates-to-7400-now-wide-open/">sharp decline in bitcoin</a> price below the $7,800 support, resulting in a downward push in ripple and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/ethereum-eth-hits-final-bearish-target-whats-next/">Ethereum</a> against the US Dollar. XRP/USD failed to stay above the $0.2450 and $0.2420 support levels, and declined heavily.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price broke the $0.2400 support area and settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price tested the $0.2350 support area and a low was formed near $0.2347.</p>
      <p>Recently, the price started an upside correction above the $0.2400 resistance area. Besides, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2526 high to $0.2347 low.</p>
      <p>However, the previous support near the $0.2450 and $0.2460 levels is currently acting as a resistance. Additionally, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2526 high to $0.2347 low is also near the $0.2458 level.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a new bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Therefore, ripple price might struggle to clear the $0.2450 and $0.2460 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>Should there be an upside break above the $0.2460 resistance, the price could test the $0.2500 area and the 100 hourly SMA. The main resistance for a trend change is near the $0.2580 level.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.2400 level. If the price fails to stay above $0.2400, it will most likely continue lower towards the $0.2350 support area.</p>
