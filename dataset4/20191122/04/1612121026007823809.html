      <p>The Google Pixel 3 was a pretty good phone. It reviewed well, had some great promos, and will be supported for the next several years, and that’s not even mentioning how good its camera is, even if it <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346463-google-pixel-3-poor-sales/">didn’t really sell well</a>.</p>
      <p>But like all good things, the Pixel 3’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338752-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl-heading-into-the-sunset/">time must come to an end</a>. Google looks to have finally exhausted its back stock of last year’s flagship phone, which means you’re only option <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345281-google-pixel-4-announcement/">going forward is the Pixel 4.</a></p>
      <p>This out-of-stock situation applies to both the Google Store and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/335434-a-customer-service-nightmare-with-google-fi/">Google Fi’s</a> shop, and stretches across multiple countries. You might still luck out and find some old stock hanging out at a Best Buy or a Target, and there might even be a good sale to go along with dwindling inventory, but don’t expect that to be the case for much longer.</p>
      <p>Say your goodbyes, folks. It’s Pixel 4 time.</p>
