      <h1>Floyd Mayweather to return to the ring after announcing he will come out of retirement</h1>
      <h2>Mayweather announced on Instagram he will pull on the gloves again, with UFC president Dana White then taking to Twitter to share the news hinting at possible switch to UFC</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:51:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:51</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather has announced a sensational return to the ring next year with an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post declaring: 'Coming out of retirement in 2020'.</p>
      <p>Mayweather's post was then reposted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> by UFC president Dana White, after speculation in recent days the two were planning to work together.</p>
      <p>The announcement by Mayweather will also fuel speculation he could be about to make the move into UFC.</p>
      <p>He has previously suggested he would one day move into mixed martial arts in some capacity, although he has also said that boxing will always reign supreme over other combat sports.</p>
      <p>Mayweather and White were seen taking in a basketball game together on Wednesday night, sending the rumour mill into overdrive.</p>

      <p>Boston Celtics fan White watched his side lose 107-104 to the Los Angeles Clippers from the best seats in the house.</p>
      <p>White had planned to launch his new venture Zuffa Boxing last month as he deviates from mixed martial arts.</p>
      <p>He has given little away about his venture but is believed to be planning not to recognise the traditional sanctioning bodies, the IBF, WBC, WBA and WBO.</p>
      <p>That would bring his promotion in line with the UFC which has only one belt per division.</p>

      <p>Mayweather worked with White for his fight with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in 2017 which the boxer won by 10th-round stoppage.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old said that when he boxed McGregor, it gave mixed martial arts a huge boost.</p>
      <p>"We gave the MMA sport a boost," he said. "Eventually I will move on to build my brand in MMA but for right now I'm in boxing, and boxing will always be at the top as long as I'm involved."</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old recently insisted he will not return to the ring despite being linked with a rematch with Manny Pacquiao.</p>

      <p>"I've got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth," he told Reuters.</p>
      <p>"Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>
      <p>"You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career.</p>
      <p>"I'll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions; between $10 and $30 million.</p>
      <p>"I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting."</p>
      <p>But he appears to have performed a U-turn with his latest announcement.</p>
