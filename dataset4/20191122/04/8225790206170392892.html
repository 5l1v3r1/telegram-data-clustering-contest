      <p>DALLAS (AP) — A rare near-mint condition copy of the first Marvel Comics comic book has sold at auction in Dallas for $1.26 million.</p>
      <p>Heritage Auctions says the <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/golden-age-1938-1955-/marvel-comics-1-windy-city-pedigree-timely-1939-cgc-nm-94-off-white-pages/a/7212-91090.s">Marvel Comics No. 1</a> from 1939 sold Thursday. Heritage says the buyer wished to remain anonymous.</p>
      <p>Ed Jaster, senior vice president at Heritage, calls it “a historic copy of a historic comic book.” The issue features the first appearances of characters such as the Human Torch, Ka-Zar, Angel and the Sub-Mariner.</p>
      <p>Heritage says the comic book was first purchased at a newsstand by a Uniontown, Pennsylvania, mail carrier who made a practice of buying the first issue of comic books and magazines. Jaster says that since then, the issue has only changed owners a handful of times.</p>
