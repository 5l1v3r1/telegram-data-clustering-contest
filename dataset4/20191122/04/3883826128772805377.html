        <b>Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has cancelled its annual fashion show amid dwindling television ratings and rising criticism of the event.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year.</p>
      <p>Last year it had its lowest ratings ever and drew criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity.</p>
      <p>The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to "evolve" its marketing strategy.</p>
      <p>"We're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers," Stuart Burgdoerfer, L Brands chief financial officer, told investors on an earnings call.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he said the shows were "an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement".</p>
      <p>The annual show featured some of the world's top supermodels, often wearing elaborate outfits.</p>
      <p>The show was a milestone in the career of many supermodels including Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Miranda Kerr.</p>

      <p>Changing attitudes appear to have hit sales and the brand's bottom line.</p>
      <p>Poor sales at Victoria's Secret weighed on the performance of L Brands, which reported a net loss of $252m (Â£195.1m) in third quarter results announced this week.</p>

      <p>The underwear brand has also faced a number of recent controversies.</p>
      <p>Last year, there was a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then-chief marketing officer Ed Razek who suggested "transsexual" models should not be part of the event.</p>
      <p>He later apologised for the comments and left the company earlier this year.</p>
      <p>L Brands also received bad publicity due to billionaire founder Les Wexner's friendship with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48913377">late US financier Jeffrey Epstein.</a></p>
      <p>Epstein died in prison in August while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49653273">Mr Wexner employed Epstein as an adviser, but cut ties in 2007</a>, and has previously accused Epstein of misappropriating money.</p>
