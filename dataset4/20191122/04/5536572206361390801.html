      <p>With a little under two minutes to go in the 4th quarter, Deshaun Watson hiked and kept the ball for a designed run.</p>
      <p>He got hit pretty hard to the point where the ball clearly came out for a fumble.</p>
      <p>Even with the Texans calling a timeout, the play wasn’t reviewed and the Texans would go on to run the clock out.</p>
