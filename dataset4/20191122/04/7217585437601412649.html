      <p>A report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973889/microsoft-outlook-web-gmail-google-drive-calendar-integration-support-features">The Verge</a> on Wednesday revealed that Microsoft is testing Gmail, Calendar and Google Drive integration on Outlook.</p>
      <p>First spotted by Twitter user Florian B, the feature allows users to link their Google and Outlook.com accounts on the web version of the latter platform.</p>

      <p>Though the test is in its early stages, it suggests that Outlook users could soon have direct access to their Google emails, events and documents.</p>
      <p>Microsoft later confirmed the test in a statement to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/20/microsoft-gmail-integration-outlook/">Engadget</a>.</p>
      <p>“We are always looking for new ways to extend the best email experience to our customers and can confirm that we’re experimenting with a small set of Outlook.com users to learn and gather feedback,” it told the publication.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the company also launched an <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/microsofts-new-office-app-combines-word-excel-and-powerpoint-on-mobile/">integrated app featuring Word, Excel and PowerPoint</a> on mobile.</p>
