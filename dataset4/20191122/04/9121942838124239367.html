      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) — Classes at four schools in inner-city Baltimore have been canceled due to a fire at a shopping center.</p>
      <p>News outlets report the roof caved in at the Edmonson Village Shopping Center in west Baltimore as firefighters battled flames early Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The schools have been closed due to road closures and low water pressure in the area.</p>
      <p>The Baltimore Fire Department says in a tweet that 10 businesses have been impacted. No injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what caused the fire. Fire Commander Roman Clark told WBAL-TV that crews had to dig up a gas line underneath the road to shut off gas feeding the fire.</p>
