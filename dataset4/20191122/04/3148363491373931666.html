      <p>The president and first lady traveled aboard Air Force One to the military base in Delaware for the solemn occasion.</p>
      <p>The two flag-draped coffins of Chief Warrant Officer 2 David C. Knadle of Tarrant, Texas and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr. of Keaau, Hawaii arrived as the president saluted and the first lady placed her hand on her heart.</p>
      <p>The president stood silently with his hand in salute as he watched six members of the U.S. Army carry the two transfer cases to the waiting transfer vehicle.</p>
      <p>Both soldiers were killed in Afghanistan in a helicopter crash.</p>

      <p>The president and first lady also met with family members.</p>
      <p>The media received consent from the family to cover the fallen soldiers’ return to American soil.</p>
      <p>Actor John Voight joined the Trumps for the event and spoke to the press afterward.</p>
      <p>“Who can speak for these families and what they are going through,” he said, describing the transfer ceremony as “so respectful, so dignified.”</p>
      <p>Voight said that President Trump invited him to join them on the trip after <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/21/donald-trump-travels-to-dover-for-transfer-of-fallen-soldiers-slain-overseas/">awarding</a> him The National Medal of Arts earlier in the evening.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to pay my respects,” he said.</p>
