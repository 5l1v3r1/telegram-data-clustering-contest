      <p>Harry Styles has reflected on his time in One Direction and said he avoided experimenting with drugs for fear of risking the band’s success.</p>
      <p>Styles, 25, made headlines in August when he revealed he bit the end of his tongue off in Malibu while high on mushrooms during the recording of his new album, Fine Line.</p>
      <p>The singer will appear on Zane Lowe’s Apple Music radio show on Friday as he prepares for the release of the record.</p>
      <p>He has now opened up on his drug use and said he only felt safe enough to experiment after leaving One Direction in 2016.</p>

      <p>He told Lowe: “When I was in the band, it was like, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us that I kind of felt like, I’m not going to be the one who f**** it up.</p>
      <p>“So I was like, now is the time in my life when you probably go out and experiment and do this and you take this and you do that and that’s what you do with your friends.</p>
      <p>“And I was like, I’m not going to be the guy who messes it up. So I was like, I’m not going to do any of that stuff.”</p>

      <p>However, Styles said it was different while recording Fine Line at Malibu’s famous Shangri-La studios, saying he felt “so safe”.</p>
      <p>“Making this record felt like, I just felt so much more joyous and I was with my friends and we were in Malibu. I felt so safe,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It was like, I want to take some mushrooms, now is the time to have fun. We’re in Malibu, 24, I’m also in music.”</p>
      <p>Styles told Rolling Stone magazine that while recording Fine Line, which will contain the singles Lights Up and Watermelon Sugar, he would “do mushrooms” and listen to the Paul McCartney album Ram and lie in the sunshine.</p>
      <p>Pointing to a corner at Shangri-La studios in Malibu, Styles said: “This is where I was standing when we were doing mushrooms and I bit off the tip of my tongue. So I was trying to sing with all this blood gushing out of my mouth. So many fond memories, this place.”</p>
      <p>Fine Line will be released on December 13.</p>
