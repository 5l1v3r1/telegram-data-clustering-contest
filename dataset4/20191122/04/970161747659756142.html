      <p>You can get free fries at McDonald’s on 22 November so it’s perfect if you’re saving your pennies for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> next week.</p>
      <p>The fast-food restaurant regularly offers deals through their app and this time, it’s fries.</p>
      <p>There’s no purchase necessary but you do need to order through the app to get the deal.</p>
      <h3>How to get the McDonald’s app</h3>
      <p>You can download it from the app store and sign up online, before completing registration.</p>
      <p>You then complete your order and go to the store to collect. You can now even order directly to your table through your phone.</p>
      <p>Table Markers are being rolled out, which means you can find somewhere to sit, put the number on the table into the app and then someone will bring the food to you.</p>
      <h3>Can you get free McDonald’s fries at all restaurants?</h3>
