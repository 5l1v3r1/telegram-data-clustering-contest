      <p>On November 20, Union home minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that the Nation Register of Citizens (NRC) would be prepared for every state in the country. Till now, an NRC has been prepared only in Assam. Necessitated by widespread allegations of massive and unabated illegal immigration from Bangladesh, the state had taken out its first NRC list in 1951. This NRC was updated on August 31 this year through a massive exercise monitored by the Supreme Court of India and it was found that 1.9 million of the 329 million, who had applied for inclusion of their names in NRC, were not eligible for citizenship.<br/><br/>Immediately after Shah's statement in Parliament, Assam finance minister and the home minister's trusted lieutenant Himanta Biswa Sarma addressed a press conference in Assam and said that the state government had decided to reject the Supreme Court-monitored NRC as it "included many who should not have been and excluded many who are genuine Indian citizens". In fact, not a single stakeholder in the NRC process seemed to be happy with the final outcome. There has been a widespread perception in the state that large numbers of infiltrators from Bangladesh, mostly Muslims-between 4 million to 10 million-have illegally entered the state posing a serious threat to the cultural and linguistic identity of the indigenous population and their rights over resources and political power. Hence, the inclusion of a large number of people who belong to local tribes and the Assamese-speaking section of the state population, in the group not eligible for citizenship came as a huge disappointment. The result was electorally significant for the Bharatiya Janata Party too as, according to unofficial sources, around 50 per cent of the 1.9 million excluded from the NRC are Hindus, the core vote bank for the saffron party.</p>

      <p>It's the reason why both Shah and Sarma have asserted that the new process to prepare a nationwide NRC would include Assam as well. Simply put, it means that the Supreme Court-monitored NRC will remain just a piece of paper and the entire exercise will be redone-this time all over the country.<br/><br/>However, there is no clarity on how this ambitious project will be executed since it is certain that the Assam model will not be replicated. While the 1951 NRC in Assam was published by recording the particulars of all the persons enumerated in that year's census, the 2019 NRC made several deviations from the existing constitutional provisions on citizenship. Existing rules, applicable across the country, provide for the preparation of an NRC strictly through house-to-house enumeration. However, Citizenship Act Rules were amended exclusively for Assam to allow claims of direct descendants of those figuring in the 1951 NRC or the 1971 electoral rolls of Assam in the updated NRC. This tweaking of law happened because of the Assam Accord, a tripartite agreement signed in 1985 by the Union government, the state government and leaders of the six-year-long Assam agitation aimed at throwing out illegal Bangladeshis from the state.<br/><br/>The accord fixed March 25, 1971, as the cut-off date for determining anyone's right to claim Indian citizenship. That was when the war for the liberation of Bangladesh began. This special exception-granting citizenship to those who entered Assam between 1947 and 1971-was made only for Assam. According to Article 6 of the Constitution, applicable in the rest of the country, anybody from East or West Pakistan, who enters India after July 19, 1948, must apply for citizenship. Many in Assam, including Sarma, objected to this cut-off mark and wanted 1951-the year first NRC was published-as the cut-off. The Union government has not specified any cut off for the proposed NRC yet. However, fixing a cut-off date could be the easier challenge for the Narendra Modi-led Union government. The success of NRC will depend on the cooperation of the state governments since they will be the ones who will be required to provide logistics for this massive exercise. While several Northeastern states are demanding the NRC, several non-BJP states have turned down the idea. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has openly said that she would not let NRC happen in her state.</p>

It's important for a nation to keep a count of its citizens. This exercise may have a crucial impact on the national security of India, but critics of the BJP see this exercise as an attempt to isolate Muslims in the country. The rush to discard the 2019 Assam NRC has further raised this suspicion, as several sources confirm that an unexpectedly low number of Muslims got excluded from NRC. At the same time, exclusion of almost equal number of Hindus and other tribal have put the BJP in an uncomfortable situation, much in contrast to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's idea of Hindu Rashtra.<br/><br/>Adding credibility to this criticism is the BJP's desperation to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, which aims at providing citizenship to those Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who came to India before December 31, 2014, fleeing religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Though the citizenship amendment bill, introduced in Lok Sabha in 2016, covers refugees from three nations, it was primarily aimed at protecting the Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan.<br/><br/>The BJP tried to hard sell the bill in Assam, projecting it as a strategy to protect the Hindu identity of Assam against the influx of Muslims from Bangladesh, but failed to take into account the fear among the Assamese of the cultural hegemony of the Hindu Bengalis. As the first Narendra Modi government could not get the bill passed in Rajya Sabha, it lapsed. Prime Minister Modi and BJP president Shah have, however, reiterated that their party is committed to passing the bill, likely to be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament, and which has already resulted in massive protests in Assam and other Northeastern states.<br/><br/>In the face of all this criticism coming its way, the BJP has countered saying that the citizenship amendment bill (CAB) is not an exercise to grant citizenship to illegal non-Muslim migrants. The party says that any individual who seeks to claim citizenship through CAB must first apply and prove that he or she faced religious atrocities and it will not encourage future immigration, as only those who entered India before December 31, 2014, were eligible to apply.</p>
      <p><b>MORE FROM INSIGHT | <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/why-patna-went-down-under-1620465-2019-11-19">Why Patna went down under</a></b><br/><br/>The goal of a nationwide NRC-to count citizens and detect all illegal immigrants in the country-is an ideal and ambitious one, but the government must first prepare a policy to handle those found to be illegally staying in the country. It's easy to detect a foreign national, but dumping them in jail is hardly a feasible solution. Especially if the numbers are found to be too high, as several estimates have claimed. India doesn't yet have the logistics and resources to house large number of detained illegal immigrants. Even Assam, the state, which saw the highest influx, still doesn't have a permanent detention center. The construction of a detention center that can house 3,000 people is currently under construction in Goalpara.<br/><br/>The Union Home Ministry has already issued a circular to all state governments to construct detention centers with modern amenities. Some states, such as Maharashtra, have already acquired land for building such facilities. Though West Bengal government is in the process of setting up two detention centres to house foreign nationals arrested on various criminal charges, the government has specified that these camps have "absolutely no connection with the NRC".<br/><br/>Proving in court that an individual is not a bona fide citizen of India is the first part of the process. The tougher task will be to determine and prove his or her country of origin and to convince that country to accept that individual back. Consider this: between 1964 and March 2019, the Foreigners' Tribunals have identified 117,164 individuals as foreigners; of these, only 29,855 (25 per cent) have been deported and the remaining aren't exactly languishing in detention centres-only 1,145, or 0.009 per cent, are housed in six temporary detention centres.<br/><br/>If Shah is serious about rolling out a nation-wide NRC, he will have to do a lot of homework before embarking on this project. Otherwise, it will be viewed as another electoral gimmick to garner votes as the Ram Temple issue has now been settled.</p>
