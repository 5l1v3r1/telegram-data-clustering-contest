      <p>Steam has been testing out their <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338413-valve-beats-google-to-the-punch-with-steam-link-cloud-streaming-to-your-phone/">Remote Play Anywhere</a> for a bit, but they’ve decided to finally pull the feature out of beta. Is it a coincidence that this happens on the same week as <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346403-google-stadia-barebones-launch/">Stadia’s launch</a>? Who knows.</p>
      <p>Regardless, if you’re big into <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/328491-steam-link-and-steam-video-are-making-their-way-to-android-tv-and-smartphones-this-month/">PC gaming</a> and Stadia seemed interesting, this might be something to check out instead. You enable Steam Link Anywhere on your computer, and can then stream your PC games directly to your phone anywhere you are. You’re effectively rolling your own Google Stadia server, but just for you. You get more control over quality of those games, too, which might be a big plus for disappointed Stadia early adopters.</p>
      <p>Steam has also announced that they’ve got tons of games that are mobile-optimized so you can actually play them with your phone’s touch screen. You can, of course, pair a controller with your phone and play things that way, which is going to be the preferred option for some more intense games.</p>
      <p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay#anywhere">Valve’s listing for the new feature</a>.</p>
