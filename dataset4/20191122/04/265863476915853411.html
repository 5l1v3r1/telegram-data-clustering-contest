      <h1>Channing Tatum And Ex-Wife Jenna Dewan Are Officially Divorced</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:37:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:37</time> by <a rel="author">Bridget Hill</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, around a year and a half after Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan’s separation, the couple has officially gotten divorced. It couldn’t come at a better time, considering Jenna is getting ready to have her first baby with Steve Kazee, and Channing is dating Jessie J.</p>
      <p>Page Six confirmed <i>The Hateful Eight</i> star and the model finalized their divorce in a Los Angeles court on Tuesday. TMZ reported earlier that they hadn’t hammered out a property settlement agreement or a custody agreement either. They have a six-year-old daughter together named Everly.</p>
      <p>As it was previously reported, the 38-year-old model and 44-year-old, Steve Kazee, revealed the news that she was expecting in September of this year. Tatum, on the other hand, is dating the aforementioned singer. Channing’s new romance came as a bit of a surprise to the model, however.</p>
      <p>The relationship reportedly shocked Ms. Dewan when she found out about it on the internet. Jenna and Tatum first broke up back in April 2018, and Jessie and Channing reportedly started seeing each other in October of the same year.</p>
      <p>Backing to the topic of the ex-couple’s divorce, on the 26th of October, 2018, the divorce papers were filed. Other than her separation with Channing, Jenna manages to keep her name out of the spotlight, except for on a few occasions.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Jenna sparked controversy when she criticized the uncriticizable: Beyonce Knowles. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, she took Beyonce to task for her walk.</p>

      <p>During her appearence on the show, Jenna said that while she liked Beyonce a lot, she and a lot of other female performers performed the same kind of strut that she was never really a big fan of. Interestingly, fans never came for Jenna Dewan the way that people would’ve initially thought.</p>
      <p>However, Jenna noted that Beyonce doesn’t do the walk in the same way she used to. Now, she walks perfectly on her heels. When she used to watch her old performances though, she would always wonder why Beyonce would walk in such a way.</p>
      <p>Dewan joked on the show that she was expecting to hear the whole world now on her social media.</p>
