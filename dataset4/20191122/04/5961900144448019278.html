      <p><a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/no-activity-us"><i>No Activity</i></a> is brought to you by an incredible comedy team including the hilarious <b>Will Ferrell</b>, <a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/anchorman-the-legend-of-ron-burgundy-2004"><i>Anchorman</i></a> director <b>Adam McKay</b> and the rest of the Funny or Die production group who are known as legends in the comedy world.</p>

      <p>The third season picks up where season 2 left off following their shitshow of a drug bust. The lead detectives are joined by dispatch’s Janice (<b>Amy Sedaris</b>) and Fatima (<b>Sunita Mani</b>) who act as a hilarious yin to Cullen and Tolbeck’s yang.</p>
      <p>Also returning is <b>Jason Mantzoukas</b> (<i><a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch//the-house-2017">The Hous</a>e</i>) as an undercover FBI agent and Oscar winner <b>J.K. Simmons</b> (<a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/veronica-mars-2019"><i>Veronica Mars</i></a>) as Leon, the internal affairs investigator with a fondness for deep sea fishing.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/no-activity-us"><i> No Activity</i></a> franchise has always attracted stellar comedy talent and its third season is no different, boasting a bunch of epic guest stars that’ll have you hella keen for what’s to come.</p>
      <p>New guest stars this season include comedy qween <b>Beth Behrs</b> (<i>2 Broke Girls</i>), 11/10 babe <b>Joe Keery </b>(<i>Stranger Things</i>), <b>Keegan-Michael Key </b>(<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>)</i>, <b>Paula Pell </b>(<a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/smilf"><i>SMILF</i></a>), <b>Dylan McDermott</b> (<i>American Horror Story</i>) and from what we hear, this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

      <p>The star-studded cop comedy has become a fave among fans and critics alike, with many praising the writers’ ability to spin such hilarious dialogue with so little activity (as the title suggests).</p>
      <p>You see, the basic premise of the series is that the cops are in pursuit of a drug cartel but with the bad guys’ plan stalled, our heroes have no choice but to sit and wait in their car on stake-out.</p>
      <p>The two partners can only talk to each other to pass the time, and the same is true for the criminals on the inside and the dispatchers back at the station.</p>
      <p>So while the show has a super heavy plot, the lack of action (barring the drug bust <a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/no-activity-us">at the end of season 2</a>, of course) means that the funniest moments come from the clever banter between the teams.</p>
      <p>This kind of writing formula is not unlike the one used on one of the greatest TV comedies of all time, <a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/seinfeld"><i>Seinfeld</i></a><i>,</i> which is known as ‘a show about nothing’.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/no-activity-us">No Activity</a></i> is about something, but the conversations about nothing make for some bloody excellent comedic moments.</p>
