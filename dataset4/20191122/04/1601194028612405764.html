      <p>The Houston Texans claimed sole possession of first place in the NFL's AFC South with a 20-17 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
      <p>Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins starred as the Texans (7-4) moved clear in the AFC South on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Texans quarterback Watson threw two touchdown passes to Hopkins and finished with 298 yards against the Colts (6-5).</p>
      <p>The Texans, who were humbled 41-7 by the Baltimore Ravens last week, trailed by four points early in the fourth quarter in Houston.</p>

      <p>But the Texans rallied â€“ Hopkins stretching out for a 30-yard reception as Houston moved 20-17 ahead of Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>Houston's defence then stepped up and stopped the Colts on fourth-and-seven with three minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>There was some late controversy 50 seconds from the end, when Watson ran the ball and had it punched out.</p>

      <p>The Colts appealed for the recovered fumble but there was no review and the Texans kept the ball, eventually running out the clock.</p>
      <p>After the game, the NFL said, "there was no clear visual evidence of a recovery by the defence".</p>
      <p>Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett was 16 of 25 for 129 yards, while he rushed for a touchdown.</p>
