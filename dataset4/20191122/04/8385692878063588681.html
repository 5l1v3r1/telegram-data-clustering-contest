      <p>Right now, in Amazon's Black Friday Week of sales, you can save $200 on the Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10+, Galaxy S10e, Galaxy Note or Galaxy Note 10+ and also get a pair of Galaxy Buds for free. That makes this a really sweet deal for those looking to get a new smartphone, as you'll also get a pair of Galaxy Buds too.</p>
      <p>Also part of its Black Friday Week of sales, you'll find the bundle of the Ring Video Doorbell 2 and the Echo Show 5 on sale for just $139. Now for reference the Ring Video Doorbell 2 is normally priced at about $199 by itself. That makes this a really great deal. With the Echo Show 5, you can talk to whoever is at the door, that your Ring doorbell sees, making this a really cool bundle.</p>
      <p>Best Buy has also discounted the HP Chromebook 14 AMD A4-powered model, by $50. This brings it back down to $199, a price we haven't seen for a few weeks. It is also its all-time lowest price. Making it definitely a great time to pick one up. This has a 14-inch full HD display, powered by the AMD A4 processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. And it comes in a very nice dark gray color.</p>

      <p>Best Buy has started its "Beat the Rush" sale, which offers Black Friday prices, ahead of Black Friday. And that includes a great deal on this 65-inch Samsung Q60 QLED TV. It is now just $999, good for $200 off. And this is going to be the same price on Black Friday, so you might as well beat the rush (hence the name of the sale) and pick one up now!</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
