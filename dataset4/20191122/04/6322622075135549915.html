      <p>PETALING JAYA (Nov 22): Key ASIC Bhd is focusing on selling licensing of its design Intellectual Properties (IPs) to drive future revenue.</p>
      <p>Chairman Eg Kah Yee said the group has invested in the development of more design IPs for the past few years and expects greater revenue contribution from IPs that it has developed.</p>
      <p>"So, what we realised [is] that the investment we made over the last few years, some of those even invested six or seven years ago [are] now actually valuable.</p>
      <p>"Other than designing chips, we will focus on licensing the technology that we have built," he told reporters after Key ASICâ€™s 2019 annual general meeting here, today.</p>
      <p>Eg said China and Russia will be their key market to promote licensing of its IPs.</p>
      <p>"The Russian government decided to invest millions of dollars in a lot of microelectronics, just like Singapore. So, we see a lot of big contribution from Russia because there is money there. So we see from next year onward our contribution will be much bigger," he added.</p>
      <p>At present, Russia contributed up to 30% of the company's revenue while China and Taiwan 67%, and the rest came from Singapore and the United States, among others.</p>
      <p>"China consumed probably about 80% of global chips but they don't use it. They make it as products and sell it out.</p>
      <p>"But Russia doesn't have exports of chips, it self consumed," he said, adding that Russia imports of chips are growing to more than US$6 billion as they are going through digitalisation.</p>
      <p>Overall, Eg said 2020 will be a good year for the company on the back of trade war between the US and China.</p>
      <p>He said following supply disruption, the company sees the trade war as opportunities to tap more customers from both countries.</p>
      <p>In the financial year 2019 ended May 31, 2019, Key Asic posted a net loss of RM2.04 million compared to a net profit of RM3.71 million in 2018.</p>
      <p>It also registered a lower revenue at RM24 million from RM29.42 million previously due to lower demand from recurring services and non-recurring services.</p>
      <p>For the first quarter of 2020 ended Oct 30, 2019, Key ASIC recorded a net loss of RM1.49 million compared to a net profit of RM1.31 million.</p>
      <p>The company posted a lower revenue of RM3.12 million from RM7.95 million previously.</p>
