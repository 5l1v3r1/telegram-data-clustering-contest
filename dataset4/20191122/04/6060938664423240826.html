According to reports doing the rounds, a person named Rama <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sawant">Sawant</a> has filed a complaint against the actress at the NM Joshi Marg Police station for wearing a deep neck top with Lord Ram’s name printed on it.</p>
      <p>The actress has deleted the photo from her account since the outrage. Reports claim that Vaani was called to the police station to record her statement. She has, however, not yet made any public statement about the same.</p>
      <p>The devotee of ‘Lord Sri Ram’ the actress was wearing “vulgar cloth in semi-nude position”. The letter reportedly claims that her clothing had the word 'Ram' printed over it and goes on to ask for an FIR to be registered against the actress for an offence punishable U/S. 215A of the IPC.</p>
      <p>The letter demands that Vaani be brought to book or punished in accordance with the law.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, another photo on the actress' Instagram account sees her in a similar top and brown pants, but without the word 'Ram' printed on it.</p>
