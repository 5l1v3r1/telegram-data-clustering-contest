          <b>The rising automation of the workforce and adoption of robotic technology may be enhancing productivity and profitability in the industrial and services sectors. But its potential effect on job losses remains a concern for stakeholders, TOBA AGBOOLA reports.</b>

      </p>
      <p>With technology changing the way businesses operate, by creating a shift from manual to automated processes, thereby reducing the number of workers, the unemployment rate in the country is sure going to surge. This, among other reasons, explains why stakeholders and labour organisations are expressing concerns about the impact of technology adoption, particularly robots, would have on the labour market.</p>
      <p>Across sectors, in recent times, robots are being handed jobs hitherto done by humans. These tasks include testing or inspecting products, picking and packaging, or assembling small electronic sets.</p>
      <p>According to experts, as robots become smarter, faster and cheaper, they are increasingly taking on more “human” capabilities and traits, such as sensing, dexterity, memory and trainability.</p>
      <p>At the 10th Triennial National Delegates Conference of the Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) in Abuja, stakeholders were of the view  that employers are interested in recruiting cheap labour and procuring cheap raw-materials while restricting access to advanced production techniques for employees’ to develop their skills.</p>
      <p>They said the introduction of digital innovations has led to a flurry of new actors and new tools entering the financial institutions.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the programme, the National President, ASSBIFI, Comrade Oyinkansola Olasanoye, said this was a major threat not only to the institutions, but to the general public and the employees as most of the new actors are often less regulated and less labour-intense.</p>
      <p>She said the rise of robot advisers in the financial service is another development that  merits further consideration, adding that  not only are these machines impartial, they exhibit the biases of their programmers and are able to gather all information a human salesperson can with soft skills, possiblly leading to sub-optional financial advice.</p>
      <p>She said: “Customers are at new risks of machines programmed to direct their actions. The issues of fairness in competition is also a major concern as the digital world is a winner takes all business.</p>
      <p>”The increase in financial inclusion as a result of the digitalisation of financial services, as more people have a mobile phone than a bank account, if not adequately regulated, will lead to a predatory behaviours and excessive transaction costs being imposed on these new and in experienced customers. In addition, new regulations have increased the cost of doing business and policy compliance costs.”</p>
      <p>Olasanoye said the combined effect of all these innovations and their impact on financial stability and on the viability of traditional banks and insurance companies requires a careful balance between fostering innovation and ensuring a regulatory level playing field.</p>
      <p>”The management of our banks and insurance institutions have responded to all these development in several ways including closing branches, cutting staff, re-focusing client relationship, developing and re-developing their digital offer and working to integrate the block chain technology. They have used the complexity and burden of these regulations as an excuse to become more fragile with several consequences. There would indeed be very little public support or political appetite for a new round bailout,” she said.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Officer, Precise Financial System Ltd, Dr Yele Okeremi who is also the guest speaker admonished labour unions to prepare for a different world of work that is emerging.</p>
      <p>As the line between employer and employees grows thinner, Okeremi urged the Federal Government to get its workforce ready for the future of work that would rely on innovation and technology, and the one that would present fluid interchanges between an employer and an employee.</p>
      <p>He explained: “Let anyone say whatever they want about automation taking jobs, that line of thought will not stop the world from deploying technology and innovation. My opinion is to ask how Nigeria can get her people ready for the automation technology.</p>

      <p>“While technology may take away jobs, technology will also create jobs in other sectors of the economy. What we should be focusing on is, will we still be able to get future workers to be interested in the kinds of services that would be required in the future because the future will require knowledgeable workers whose bargaining powers as individuals would be huge that some of them would ask if they actually need a union? So, unions themselves would have to start reconsidering its value proposition in that new context or else they would completely transform into irrelevance. As it is for the unions, so it is for employers’ and organisations.”</p>
      <p>He said major stakeholders must prepare for the world of work that is rapidly evolving.</p>
      <p>He said: “The dynamics of the economy and the forces that are shaping globalisation are such that a future world of work would not be a future that would be synonymous with the type of employment we have now. When people come out to talk about contract staffing or outsourcing, then they are missing the point. This is because these are just forms of employment and the fact that they are forms of employment should not disqualify them as decent work.</p>
      <p>”The future of work may not necessarily mean that somebody would have to report in a physical space to resume at 8am and close at 5pm. Indeed, we do not have the terminologies to describe some of the forms of employment that will emerge in the next 20 to 50 years. The reality is that it will certainly happen. The form it will take, nobody knows.”</p>
      <p>Okeremi warned that the world of work would be so fluid in the future that there would be thin line between employer and employee.</p>
      <p>He said: “A time will come when it will be difficult to define whether someone is an employer or is an employee. So, our issue is simply is the imperative for a strong regulation, a strong inspection that will ensure that wherever employment emerges, that work is considered to be decent. For me, that should be the focus and not on whether somebody is on a regular, pensionable employment or on a short contract. That is what we know now, but there are other forms of employment that are on their way.”</p>
      <p>The General Secretary, Non-Academic Staff Union and Associated Institutions (NASU), Peters Adeyemi, said while the fears that automation may lead to job losses in Africa and other developing countries, massive job losses have not been recorded in developed countries that have deployed robotics in most economic areas.</p>
      <p>He said: “The usage of automation to do jobs that human beings were hitherto doing, is a phenomenon that is already happening in Europe and some parts of Asia. But don’t forget that Europe has moved so much ahead of Africa in terms of employment and unemployment rate. There are some countries in Europe where the rate of employment is virtually zero.</p>
      <p>“So, this issue of automation taking over the jobs human beings are doing has been on for years and there has not been statistics or data to show that even in the developed economies where automation is happening that jobs are already being lost. I must quickly add that that is not to say that automation is not a threat to jobs globally.</p>
      <p>”In our own situation, we must admit that automation will pose a threat though not an immediate threat because things that are needed to ensure automation runs smoothly are not on ground here.”</p>
      <p>Adeyemi also pointed out that lack of stable electricity would hugely inhibit the functionality of an automated industrial space.</p>
      <p>He posited that although government seems not to be ready to automate the industrial space, such a move would lead to mass unemployment and aggravate insecurity in the country.</p>
