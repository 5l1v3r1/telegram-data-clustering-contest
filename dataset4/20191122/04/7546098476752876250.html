      <h1>Insiders have been buying Rio Tinto and these ASX shares</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:36:06+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>Once a week I like to look at which shares have experienced meaningful insider buying.</p>
      <p>This is because insider buying is often regarded as a bullish indicator, as few people know a company and its intrinsic value better than its own directors.</p>
      <p>A number of shares have reported meaningful insider buying this week. Here are a few that caught my eye:</p>
      <h3>Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd (ASX: DMP)</h3>
      <p>According to a change of director’s interest notice, one of this pizza chain operator’s non-executive directors has been buying shares this week. On November 18 Uschi Schreiber bought 1,000 shares through an on-market trade. The director paid an average of $52.5155 per share, which equates to a total consideration of $52,515. These are the first shares that Schreiber has bought since joining the company at the end of last year.</p>
      <h3>Prospa Group Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Prospa+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-PGL">(ASX: PGL)</a></h3>
      <p>A number of this online lender’s directors have taken advantage of a sell off earlier this week to pick up shares. According to a series of change of director’s interest notices, directors including Aviad Eyal, Gail Pemberton, Fiona Trafford-Walker, and its CEO, Beau Bertoli all dipped into the market. The two largest purchases were made by Eyal and Pemberton. They bought $383,000 and $100,000 worth of shares, respectively, after they crashed lower following its <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/18/why-the-prospa-share-price-crashed-28-lower-to-a-52-week-low-today/">trading update</a>. It appears as though they believe this sell off has been a buying opportunity and are confident in its future prospects.</p>
      <h3>Rio Tinto Limited <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Rio+Tinto+Limited/?ticker=ASX-RIO">(ASX: RIO)</a></h3>
      <p>A change of director’s interest notice reveals that independent non-executive director, Megan Clark AC, has been buying shares recently. According to the notice, Clark bought 525 shares through an on-market on November 18. The director paid an average of $94.33 per share, which works out to be a total consideration of $49,523.25. This purchase lifted Clark’s holding to a total of 5,770 shares.</p>
