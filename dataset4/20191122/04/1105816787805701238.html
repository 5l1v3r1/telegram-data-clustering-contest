      <p>Vibrant economy, rule of law, efficient institutional functioning, accountability and time-management are the pillars of good governance. If the state is fragile, failing or has failed in its performance, it is primarily because of its failure to provide better governance to its people and indifference to issues which cause violence, chaos and disorder in society.</p>
      <p>Regrettably, despite the claims of various regimes — civilian or military — to render good governance and improve the quality of life of people, things are not yielding positive results. At least four issues tend to question the will, capability and capacity of the present regime to build what it calls “Naya Pakistan”. First, periodic train accidents in the country since August last year have taken over 500 lives and injured several hundred others. The most tragic accident was the spread of fire in many bogies of Tezgam at Liaquatpur which burnt 75 passengers alive. When the government fails to provide safe public transport, it means a failure in governance.</p>
      <p>Second, there is no control as far as prices of essential commodities are concerned. Not only did tomatoes and onions become out of reach for consumers; but items ranging from wheat, rice, sugar, milk, vegetables, and fruits to electricity, gas and fuel have reached exorbitant prices.</p>
      <p>Third, traffic laws are not being implemented, despite being a priority for the government. Violation of traffic signals, speeding and driving on the wrong side is extremely common, which questions the government’s writ and rule of law. VIP culture which spares “sacred cows” from traffic rules and regulations remains intact.</p>
      <p>Fourth, eradication of crimes, extremism, violence, corruption and nepotism which should have been a priority for the PTI government failed to materialise. Reports show an increase in crimes and intolerance. Zero tolerance for corruption, which has been the PTI’s slogan for years, is now a self-defeating phenomenon as misuse of authority and non-adherence to merit continue unabated.</p>
      <p>Based on the above facts and analysis, it seems that governance is not an issue for the PTI regime but completing its term and striving for another is what matters! More than a year has passed since the PTI government came into power and it has miserably failed in providing relief to people from inflation and has also defaulted on its commitment to eradicate corruption and nepotism. Taking frequent U-turns on policy matters augmented frustration and pessimism even among those who supported the PTI and its vision for a new Pakistan.</p>
      <p>A 22-year-long struggle by Imran Khan and his party to eradicate corruption, nepotism, and enforce merit, work ethics, accountability and justice has gone down the drain. The ground realities since July 2018 contradict Imran Khan’s narrative and what he has actually done after coming into power. If the people of Pakistan have been let down by him with a meagre performance in governance, rule of law and merit, what matters is erosion of his credibility. Therefore, critics argue that people were better off before August 2018 as they were not left in the lurch by those in power to battle inflation and corruption. Instead of focusing on bettering the people’s lives, the PTI government wasted 15 months in targeting its political opponents.</p>
      <p>If good governance is not the issue for Imran Khan and the PTI, one can figure out three major reasons for such a reality. First, while voting for the PTI, people had undermined the fact that the party’s leadership was neither familiar with socio-economic issues at the grassroots level nor did Imran Khan hold any such experience. He has never used public transport, government hospitals or schools nor has he struggled to buy basic commodities. He is oblivious to the issues faced by 95% of the people. Once in power, he neither possessed the will nor the capability to deal with the serious economic challenges. He, his party and cabinet, and government high-ups have abandoned the common person who is unable to survive on a meagre income. His finance adviser’s statement of tomatoes being available for Rs17 per kilogram (kg) in Karachi reflects a VIP mindset.</p>
      <p>Secondly, good governance is not an issue for the ruling elites because corruption, inefficiency, economic crisis, inhuman public transport, accumulation of garbage and poor supply of utilities do not affect them. Whether in the opposition or in the government, political parties are least mindful of the overwhelming majority that lives hand to mouth, and whose purchasing power is declining with each passing day. While living in their “comfort zones” it doesn’t matter to them if the common people cannot access clean and safe drinking water, respectable and affordable public transport, better health facilities, good quality schools, and merit-based employment opportunities.</p>
      <p>No wonder the 2018 Human Development Index (HDI) placed Pakistan on number 150 among 189 countries. The HDI is determined on the basis of wealth, income distribution, life expectancy, quality of education and healthcare. If the quality of life of merely 10% of Pakistanis is better than the remaining 90% who are either living in perpetual poverty or without proper access to basic necessities, it means the state failed to perform its duties. The <i>CEOWORLD</i> magazine, in its report, “Countries with the Best Quality of Life, 2019” published on April 11, 2019, ranked Pakistan at number 60 out of 70 countries.</p>
      <p>Third, if governance is not the issue for the ruling elites of Pakistan, including the current PTI government, the responsibility also rests with the people of Pakistan who lack courage, capability and will to take on such people who continue to let them down. Why do people then continue to support those whose bread and butter is dependent on abusing power and nepotism?</p>
      <p>Despite 72 years since its independence, Pakistan is still a feudal and tribal country with social backwardness and religious extremism at large. In this scenario, to expect the majority to be politically empowered, and culturally and socially enlightened is a pipedream. The solution to deepening bad governance cannot be found unless a bottom to top approach is pursued. It means that when social change, through a process of better education, tolerance and enlightenment, is unleashed, it will make the elites accountable and responsible. Bridging the gap in “theory and practice” by those at the helm of affairs and presenting them as “role models” as being above corruption and VIP culture is the need of the hour.</p>
