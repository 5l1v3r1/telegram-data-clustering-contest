      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Jake Burton Carpenter, the founder of Burton Snowboards and a pioneer of the sport, died Wednesday night after a lengthy and recurring battle with testicular cancer. He was 65.</p>
      <p>"It is with a very heavy heart that we share that Burton founder Jake Burton Carpenter passed away peacefully last night surrounded by his family and loved ones as a result of complications from recurring cancer," his company wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Ig5GanLx6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram</a>. "He was our founder, the soul of snowboarding, the one who gave us the sport we all love so much."</p>
      <p>Burton, a long-time sponsor of the U.S. snowboarding team, currently sponsors many of the most popular snowboarders in the world, including Olympic medalists Red Gerard and Ayumu Hirano. Olympic champions <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Shaun-White/?tps=1">Shaun White</a> and Kelly Clark also have used Burton snowboards throughout their careers.</p>
      <p>Carpenter was originally diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2011 but was healthy months later. According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/jake-burton-carpenter-who-outfitted-snowboarders-and-championed-their-sport-dies-at-65/2019/11/21/461f3544-0c79-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">Washington Post</a> and the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Snowboard-pioneer-Jake-Burton-Carpenter-dies-at-65-14852092.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, he emailed his staff earlier this month and said, "You will not believe this, but my cancer has come back."</p>

      <p>Carpenter, hoping to bring snowboarding into the mainstream, started Burton Snowboards in 1977 after he quit his job in New York. Snowboarding has since evolved into a billion-dollar industry, and he was later enshrined in the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
