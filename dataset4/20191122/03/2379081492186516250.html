      <h1>Gold little changed as U.S.-China trade uncertainty lingers</h1>

      <p>Gold prices held steady on Friday as</p>
      <p>doubts prevailed over an interim trade deal being reached</p>
      <p>between the United States and China this year.</p>
      <p>Spot gold was little changed at $1,464.36 per ounce</p>
      <p>by 0317 GMT. U.S. gold futures were up 0.1% to</p>
      <p>$1,464.60.</p>
      <p>China invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of</p>
      <p>face-to-face talks in Beijing in efforts to strike a deal, after</p>
      <p>reports that a ‘phase one’ trade deal may not be inked this</p>
      <p>year.</p>
      <p>“The trade deal is definitely the theme at the moment as it</p>
      <p>looks like the U.S. Federal Reserve’s easing is on hold, so</p>
      <p>anything positive about the trade dispute is clearly negative</p>
      <p>for gold and any delay is positive,” said Nicholas Frappell,</p>
      <p>global general manager at ABC Bullion.</p>
      <p>The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year to help</p>
      <p>shield the economy from the effects of the trade war with China</p>
      <p>before deciding to pause.</p>
      <p>Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost for holding</p>
      <p>the non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>The tariff war between the world’s top two economies have</p>
      <p>propelled gold, traditionally a safe asset in times of political</p>
      <p>and economic uncertainty, about 14% higher this year, on track</p>
      <p>for its biggest yearly gain since 2010.</p>
      <p>Investors, however, were wary that bills passed by</p>
      <p>Washington supporting the Hong Kong protesters could thwart a</p>
      <p>smooth passage of an interim trade deal.</p>
      <p>“Although Hong Kong is such an important city, the protests</p>
      <p>itself are not a problem. It’s more about how it impacts the</p>
      <p>U.S.-China relations and it’s already been discussed between</p>
      <p>both the countries,” Frappell said.</p>
      <p>Anti-government protests in Hong Kong have paralyzed the</p>
      <p>Asian financial hub for months.</p>
      <p>Weighing on bullion, Asian equities rose, but gains were</p>
      <p>capped by trade worries, while the dollar held overnight gains.</p>
      <p>U.S. data on Thursday showed weekly jobless claims</p>
      <p>unchanged, while manufacturers reported a sharp slowdown,</p>
      <p>suggesting some weakness.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, platinum dipped 0.9% to $906, but was on</p>
      <p>track to rise by about 2% for the week.</p>
      <p>A surge in investment buying will push the global platinum</p>
      <p>market into a small deficit this year, the World Platinum</p>
      <p>Investment Council said.</p>
      <p>Silver lost 0.1% to $17.07 per ounce, and palladium</p>
      <p>was down 0.1% to $1,758.62 per ounce, but was set to post</p>
      <p>its best week in five, gaining 3%.</p>
