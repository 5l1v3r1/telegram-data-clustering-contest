      <p>Suspected gunmen on Wednesday night attacked the Oyo State Commissioner for Lands, Housing and Urban Development, Abdulraheem Abiodun.</p>
      <p>The Guardian learned that the attack involving the commissioner, his driver and orderly happened at his residence in Ibadan, the state capital, around 8.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>It was also gathered that the yet-to-be-identified gunmen killed his driver, while his orderly is currently hospitalised after sustaining bullet wounds.</p>
      <p>Police authorities in the state yesterday confirmed the killing of the driver attached to the commissioner.</p>
      <p>According to the command’s spokesperson, Mr. Gbenga Fedeyi, the assailants attacked the commissioner at the Academy area of Ibadan, adding that the police orderly attached to him was also shot.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a source from the government circle said: “The sad development would be thoroughly investigated, especially coming 24 hours after Governor Seyi Makinde launched 100 vehicles to aid security patrol in the state.”</p>
      <p>The source said the commissioner, with a team of sympathisers, rushed the deceased to the Accident and Emergency Unit of the University College Hospital (UCH) on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“I saw the commissioner making calls to the governor on what happened to him and his aides. The governor ordered the security adviser to immediately proceed to UCH.</p>
      <p>“The motive behind this attack could not be ascertained as these armed men after attacking the convoy reportedly took away the gun belonging to the wounded police officer,” the source added.</p>
