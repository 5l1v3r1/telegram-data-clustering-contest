      <p>LaLiga Santander returns today with the title race hotting up. More thrills and spills are sure to come as the most competitive LaLiga table in decades currently has just two points separating the top five clubs, while local pride will be on the line as four of LaLiga’s five Basque clubs battle on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The action begins today at the Ciutat de Valencia stadium, where hosts, Levante UD beat Barcelona in their last home game, will welcome an RCD Mallorca side.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s programme begins with a top vs bottom clash, as co-leaders FC Barcelona, who have had an up and down time away from the Camp Nou this season, visit a CD Leganes team with just one win so far in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>Real Betis side, whose players and fans have had a fortnight’s international break to dwell on their derby defeat to Sevilla before hosting Valencia CF, who have climbed to sixth in the table.</p>
      <p>Three straight LaLiga Santander losses have seen Granada CF dip a little after a high-flying start. They will be fired up to welcome third-placed Atletico de Madrid, who have Portuguese starlet Joao Felix back after a month out injured.</p>
      <p>Also tomorrow evening, Real Madrid will host Real Sociedad in a clash of two teams full of exciting talents hitting form. All eyes will be on the visitors’ fit-again playmaker, Martin Odegaard, who is on loan from Real Madrid going to head with Los Blancos new midfield star, Fede Valverde.</p>
