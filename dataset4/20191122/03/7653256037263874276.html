      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/RSS">RSS</a> chief <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mohan-Bhagwat">Mohan Bhagwat</a> on Thursday met grape farmers in Nashik to enquire about the damage to crops due to unseasonal rains. He is on a four-day personal visit to the city.</p>
      <p>The meeting appears part of Sangh’s initiative to directly involve itself with the farming community. It could also be a sounding board for the government, said an expert.</p>
      <p>Commenting on this rare meeting, RSS researcher and author Dilip Deodhar said: “Bhagwat is different than other chiefs as he has been deeply involved with both politics and society. He was the one who insisted that LK Advani should retire from politics. Bhagwat, unlike previous chiefs, wants to meet more people and stay updated.” He said RSS’ claim that ‘we are not involved in politics’ in reality means ‘we are not just into politics but in all walks of life’.</p>
      <p>Bhagwat’s meeting is not a sudden action as RSS leaders have been pondering over farmers’ issues for a while. The issue of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/stubble-burning">stubble burning</a> by Punjab and Haryana farmers is also being discussed, an RSS source said. One of the ideas being suggested is to incentivise farmers by converting stubble into particle boards.</p>
      <p>Former RSS leader Rambhau Tupkari said: “RSS is always evolving, the society is so big that the Sangh is now taking a direct interest.”</p>
