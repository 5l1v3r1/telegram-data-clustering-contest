      <p>It is claimed that the said investor – Seed Co LTD, has for a long time been pursuing his quest for land to build the factory but in vain.</p>
      <p>Speaking during his inspection of the new dairy factory being built by Asas Ltd in Rungwe District, Chalamila said he is forced to issue the ultimatum after discovering that the investor was about to shift his investment to another region, and added that many projects in Mbeya Region get stuck due to bureaucracy by government officials.</p>
      <p>He cautioned public officials in the region to stop putting hurdles on potential investors and whoever will be found doing that will be dealt with.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Chalamila congratulated Asas Ltd in its decision to invest in Rungwe District as the dairy factory will stimulate the milk market in the district as well as providing income to the government.</p>
      <p>Asas manager Lipita Mtimila said the factory will start milk procession soon as there are still a few areas that have to be worked upon, but added that by June next year the factory will be working at 100 percent capacity.</p>
      <p>He said: “Our total investment is estimated at 3bn/-, construction and plant costs, hence it is a big investment that would be beneficial to us and the wananchi.”</p>
      <p>For his part the chairman of Rungwe District Council Ezekiel Mwankota said what wananchi wants is milk of good quality from their own area.</p>
      <p>The Rungwe District Commissioner Julius Challya said the district produces more than 62 million litres of milk per year but only 11 percent is sold in the formal market.</p>
