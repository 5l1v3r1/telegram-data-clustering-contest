      <p>WLAC executive director Theodosia Muhulo said in Dar es Salaam recently when marking 30th anniversary of the organisation that works to empower women to attain their rights and to improve vulnerable population’s access to justice across Tanzania.</p>
      <p>Theodosia said that the most prevalent cases which related to land and property rights claimed through matrimonial, inheritance and land matters.</p>
      <p>“There has been a notable change between 2009 and 2018, which saw an increase in the number of women asserting their rights in cases of marriage dissolutions,” she said.</p>
      <p>On litigation case to challenge the share of the widow, Theodosia said: “In 2016, WLAC filed a constitutional case in the High Court of Tanzania, Misc.Civil Cause No. 10/2016. Previously women were walking away from marriages empty handed.”</p>
      <p>According to the activist, the petition sought court declaration of widow’s entitlement to half of matrimonial property upon death of husband.</p>
      <p>The case aimed at challenging the applicability and the practice whereby the widow contribution is normally not set apart from the whole before division of deceased’s estate, thus the widow’s contribution forms part and parcel of the deceased’s estate. In doing so women’s rights (property rights) are denied as the whole property, including the separate share owned by the wife, is termed the “estate of the deceased”.</p>
      <p>On gender desks, the official said in 2009, WLAC in collaboration with Tanzania Police Female Network (TPF Net) piloted the establishment of gender desks in police stations.</p>
      <p>“So far, 280 police officers were trained on violence against women and girls (VAWG) and how to handle such cases. The implementation of the gender and children desks was replicated by police force in collaboration with other stakeholders to other regions to ensure women and girl survivors of VAWG are appropriately attended to and receive dignified services.”</p>
      <p>“Prior to such training these cases were poorly handled and there was no confidentiality which did not inspire trust in women to report such cases. Juvenal criminal justice/children in conflict with the law,” she says.</p>
      <p>At least 758 children in conflict with the law were assisted in achieving access to justice in the Juvenile Court. In 2012, WLAC collaborated in a UNICEF funded small-scale legal aid programme for children in conflict with the law (“LAP”) which initiated with a pilot programme (the Pilot) and ran from July 2012 to June 2015. It was a three tier programme which provided legal aid, representation and information to children in conflict, on bail or on remand, at court or at three detention centres in Dar es Salaam.</p>
      <p>Since 1989, WLAC has been at the forefront of the fight for the promotion and protection of women’s rights in Tanzania, accomplishing its successes through four units: legal aid, advocacy and networking, paralegal training and outreach, and publication and documentation. Although the organisation focuses on inheritance rights and gender-based violence, all issues related to gender are addressed within WLAC’s work, contributing to the realisation of its grand vision for a just society that respects the rights of women and children.</p>
      <p>The programme has since been scaled up to assist in children in the Kigoma Region with a support from UNICEF since 2018. Moreover, children in conflict with the law at Upanga Retention Home in Dar es Salaam, a recipient of the aforementioned LAP, continues to enjoy legal assistance through WLAC legal aid programme.</p>
      <p>She further said that WLAC received a certificate of appreciation from the Tanzania Police Female Network (TPF Net) under the police force which was presented to WLAC by the Vice President, Samia Sululu Hassan during the commemoration of 10 years of TPF Net commemorated on 10th November 2017.</p>
      <p>On public awareness she said that over 10 million people have been reached through raising awareness of legal and human rights through campaigns, training, community meetings, and media (mostly radio) community empowerment and sensitization: a tool end violence against women (VAW).</p>
      <p>She added that the “We Can” Campaign in Swahili ‘Tunaweza’ had a unique approach since community members are given an opportunity to identify what they feel is a problem in their communities and from there solutions were sought to address the named problems or issues.</p>
      <p>A total number of 53,828 people (24,579 male and 29,249 female) were registered as change makers, in other words people who are committed to work in the community to end violence against women.</p>
