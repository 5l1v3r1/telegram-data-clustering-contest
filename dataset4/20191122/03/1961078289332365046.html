      <h1>Man Who Threatened 2 Members of Congress Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:42:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:42</time> by <a rel="author">Ed Shanahan</a></address>
      <p>A western New York man convicted of leaving menacing phone messages for two Republican members of Congress was sentenced in federal court on Thursday to five years in prison, the second legal development in the region this week involving ominous phone calls to public officials.</p>
      <p>The man, Carlos Bayon, 64, was found guilty in July of retaliating against a public official and making interstate threats for identical messages left at the state offices of Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington.</p>
      <p>In the messages, both of which were left on June 30, 2018, Mr. Bayon alluded to revenge against the Republican lawmakers over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, according to court filings.</p>
      <p>“Hey listen,” Mr. Bayon said on the calls, according to a criminal complaint, “this message is for you and the people that sent you there. You are taking ours, we are taking yours. Anytime, anywhere. We know where they are. We are not going to feed them sandwiches, we are going to feed them lead. Make no mistake, you will pay.”</p>
      <p>“Ojo por ojo, diente por diente,” Mr. Bayon added, which is Spanish for “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” He ended the messages by saying: “That is our law and we are the majority. Have a good day.”</p>
      <p>Investigators traced the calls to Mr. Bayon, who lives in Grand Island. After he was arrested, a search of his home turned up ammunition, books on bomb-making and receipts for a semi-automatic rifle called an SKS and a .38-caliber revolver, according to an amended criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the United States Attorney’s Office in Buffalo did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bayon, who mostly represented himself at trial, argued that his messages for the lawmakers were protected free speech because they were not specific threats, according to Patrick J. Brown, a local lawyer who assisted in his defense at the court’s request.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bayon’s position, Mr. Brown said, was that he “wanted to call attention to the issue of children being separated from their parents at the border.”</p>
      <p>That argument would be the basis of Mr. Bayon’s appeal of the verdict, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown notified the court Thursday of Mr. Bayon’s plans to appeal.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bayon’s calls to the lawmakers came a little more than a year after Mr. Scalise was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/us/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html?module=inline">seriously wounded</a> when a gunman unhappy over President Trump’s election opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team at a practice field in Alexandria, Va.</p>
      <p>In a separate case in western New York, Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., of Addison, pleaded guilty on Monday to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/nyregion/ilhan-omar-patrick-carlineo-threat.html?module=inline">threatening to kill Representative Ilhan Omar</a>, a Minnesota Democrat and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/ilhan-omar-muslim-reactions.html?module=inline">one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress</a>, and to possessing guns illegally.</p>
      <p>Mr. Carlineo made his threat during a hate-filled call to Ms. Omar’s office, telling a staff member who heard it, “I’ll put a bullet in her skull,” using an expletive, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the F.B.I. at his home about a week after he made the call, Mr. Carlineo described himself as a patriot who loved Mr. Trump and hated “radical Muslims in our government,” the complaint said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Carlineo faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced on Feb. 14. In a letter to the sentencing judge that Ms. Omar posted on Twitter, she urged that Mr. Carlineo be treated with compassion.</p>
