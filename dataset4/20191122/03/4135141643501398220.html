      <p><b>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)</b> — Oliver Bjorkstrand, Boone Jenner and Eric Robinson scored in the third period, and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Detroit Red Wings 5-4 Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Jenner beat Jimmy Howard with a sharp-angle shot 8:43 into the third, 63 seconds after Bjorkstrand’s tying power-play goal. Robinson made it 5-3 before Detroit’s Tyler Bertuzzi scored with 3:14 left.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Texier and Cam Atkinson also scored, Joonas Korpisalo made 22 saves, and Columbus won its third straight.</p>
      <p>Bertuzzi had two goals, and Filip Hronek and Luke Glendening also scored for Detroit, which has lost four straight. Howard made 32 saves.</p>
      <p>Detroit, hampered by multiple injuries, came in tied with the Los Angeles Kings with the lowest point total in the NHL (17).</p>
      <p>Texier got the Blue Jackets on the board 5:37 into the first when he batted his own rebound from in front. Bertuzzi tied it later in the first when he rifled a slap shot from the top of the right circle past a partially screened Korpisalo.</p>
      <p>Atkinson got an easy tap-in off Seth Jones’ pass during a 5-on-3 power play to put the Blue Jackets up 2-1 early in the second. Detroit got its own 5-on-3 opportunity for over a minute late in the second but the Blue Jackets killed it, allowing just one shot.</p>
      <p>Hronek tied it later in the second when his shot went in off the leg of Jones, who had sprawled trying to block it in front of Korpisalo. Forty-four seconds later, Glendening put the Red Wings ahead 3-2 with a short-handed goal on an odd-man breakaway after the Blue Jackets turned over the puck at the blue line.</p>
      <p>Bertuzzi got a late goal after Detroit pulled the goalie to create a 6-on-5 situation but couldn’t get any more.</p>
