      <h1>Thick cloud of dust over Canberra should clear this weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:33:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:33</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Evans</a></address>
      <p>The thick cloud of dust over Canberra is expected to clear on Saturday morning. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the small particles were picked up by strong swirling winds across New South Wales on Thursday and then brought south over the ACT on Friday.</p>

      <p>Meteorologist Sarah Chadwick said the weather system was moving south so the thick haze should clear as the weekend progressed.</p>
      <p>"We are expecting the dust to clear out of the Canberra region on Saturday morning," she said.</p>
      <p>The bureau is forecasting temperatures of about 30 degrees for the coming week, a fall from the highs of the week that's ending. On Thursday, the temperature reached the high 30s. There's a chance of rain by Tuesday.</p>
      <p>ACT Health said most people wouldn't be affected by the haze but some might be at risk.</p>
      <p>"People who are more sensitive to dust in the air, particularly those with asthma and other heart or lung conditions, should take precautions," a statement said.</p>
      <p>"This includes staying indoors with windows and doors closed, avoiding all vigorous outdoor exercise, and taking medication as prescribed by their doctor.</p>
      <p>Canberrans could keep an eye on the air quality with the <a href="https://airrater.org/">federal government's AirRater app</a>.</p>
      <p>Officials would keep monitoring "and if there is a significant decline in air quality, we will issue further health advice".</p>
      <p>Thursday's total fire ban in the ACT expired at midnight, with a reduced danger as temperatures started to fall.</p>
      <p>Even with the cooling, temperatures remain high compared to the usual 23 degree maximum average for the month.</p>
      <p>Scientists aren't directly blaming the heat on global warming because they are reluctant to tie particular individual weather "events" to long-term changes.</p>
      <p>But bureau meteorologist Rosemary Barr said that "our climatologists are able to say that increases in temperature are observed across Australia in all seasons with both day and night-time temperatures showing warming".</p>
      <p>Across New South Wales, there were more than 50 bushfires burning at one stage as the weekend approached. The Rural Fire Service NSW said that nine regions - including the ACT - were at "very high" fire danger.</p>
