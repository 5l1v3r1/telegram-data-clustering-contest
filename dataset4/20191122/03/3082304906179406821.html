The North London club sacked Mauricio Pochettino after a disastrous start to the season and replaced him with the Portuguese who they think will bring an end to their trophy drought. But to mount a title challenge, Spurs need to make some signings and Gareth Bale is believed to be on top of their agenda.</b>

Reports had emerged on Thursday that Madrid still <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1201099/reports-real-madrid-final-decision-gareth-bale-future-premier-league-giants-manchester-united-tottenham-hotspur-interest-t/">consider the 30-year-old an integral part of the squad</a> and believe he can still be of use this season.</p>
