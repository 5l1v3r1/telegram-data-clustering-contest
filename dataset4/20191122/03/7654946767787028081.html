      <h1>Coastal Living magazine looking for subscribers again after comeback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:30:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author">Keith J. Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Coastal Living, which dropped its subscribers last year as it converted to a newsstand-only quarterly, is making a comeback and will once again be looking for home-delivery subscribers.</p>
      <p>And it stands a good chance at grabbing them as the problem had been scarcity of advertising, not scarcity of readers. The old Coastal Living had a print circulation of 591,225 subscribers and another 19,467 sold on newsstands as of Dec. 31, 2018, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.</p>
      <p>In the reboot, the publisher will be looking for a rate base — the amount of circulation it promises advertisers it will deliver each issue — of between 150,000 to 200,000, according to a spokeswoman.</p>
      <p>With the new version, the company will be charging $12.99 on newsstands as it has been over the last year. The new annual subscription price will be discounted from that rate to $20 a year for the four issues — or $30 for a two-year subscription.</p>
      <p>“We are giving the passionate readers of Coastal Living what they want – the opportunity to secure annual and biannual subscriptions to this beloved brand,” said Doug Olson, president of Meredith Magazines, <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/07/25/time-inc-confirms-three-titles-on-the-block/">which picked up Coastal Living</a> as part of its $2.8 billion takeover of Time Inc. in January 2018.</p>
