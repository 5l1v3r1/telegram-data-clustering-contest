      <p>Save the World, the PvE mode of Fortnite, has been updated to include Dungeons. According to Epic Games, you'll get to fight monsters and dodge traps, as you might expect.</p>
      <blockquote>Rumor has it that there is a forbidden area within Hexylvania. They say there are even new Weapons and Heroes to recruit along the way. Magical Keys, a deep and dark labyrinth, golden coins... sounds like it’s time to do some exploring!</blockquote>
      <p>The update also adds other characters and weapons to Save the World. Furthermore, the Mythic Storm King boss is rampaging in Twine Peaks and it will be up to players to stop it. Lastly, in a crossover with the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/battlebreakers/en-US/home">newly released Battle Breakers game</a>, reaching level 20 in that title will unlock the Razor character in Fortnite Save the World.</p>

      <p>The PvE mode of Fortnite was supposed to go free to play quite some time ago, but it hasn't yet. The original release windows was mid-2018, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-save-the-world-free-delay-2019/">then it became 2019</a>, but the year is almost over now. Truth to be told, the development seems to have lingered in comparison to the hugely popular Battle Royale PvP mode. Still, we'll let you know when the folks at Epic Games turn on the free to play switch at last.</p>
