      <p>2019 has been a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342237-asus-rog-phone-ii-ifa-2019-gaming-phone-snapdragon855-plus/">good year for phone batteries</a>, and it seems like it just keeps getting better. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346529-xiaomi-cheap-5g-phones-2020/">Xiaomi’s latest innovation</a> doesn’t make for a bigger battery, though; instead, they’re trying to charge your current battery as fast as possible.</p>
      <p>Their new 100W fast charging tech is built for today’s massive batteries, too. Xiaomi claims you can get a 4000mAh recharge in just 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi has released a teaser image of the fast charging, including a name. It’ll be called Super Charge Turbo, whenever it actually makes it way into a phone, but should be able to handle even the biggest batteries in no time at all. At that point it really doesn’t matter how bad your battery life is, because you’re just a TV show away from a completely full charge again.</p>
      <p>This is also a bit faster than <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345161-oppo-reno-ace-official/">Oppo’s currently marketed 50W fast charging</a>. But with that being said, since this is 100W charging, you’re going to need, well, 100 watts of power coming out of the wall to supply your phone with that kind of speed. 100W blocks aren’t particularly common for phones, and that even outpaces many laptops. These likely won’t be laying around at your friends’ house.</p>
