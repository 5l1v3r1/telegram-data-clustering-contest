      <p>“PSBs actively reached out to their customers in these camps and made concerted efforts towards activities such as sanctioning of loans as per prudential norms,” the government said in a statement, adding that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/punjab-sind-bank/stocks/companyid-11582.cms">PSB</a> branches not participating in the camps also increased efforts to reach customers during the month.</p>
      <p>PSBs provided Rs 1.06 lakh crore in new term loans and Rs 46,800 crore in new working capital loans during the month.</p>
      <p>Finance minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/nirmala-sitharaman">Nirmala Sitharaman</a> had on September 19 announced that public sector banks would conduct loan outreach programmes to extend credit, particularly to farmers, MSMEs and customers looking for home and vehicle loans. The announcement was part of a series of announcements by the minister aimed at boosting flagging economic growth.</p>
      <p>Agriculture loans accounted for Rs 40,504 crore of the total loan disbursements by PSBs during the month, while loans to MSMEs accounted for Rs 37,210 crore.</p>
      <p>PSB’s provided Rs 12,166 crore of credit for home loans, Rs 7,085 crore for vehicle loans and Rs 15,250 crore for other personal loans during the month.</p>
      <p>Another key agenda of the loan outreach programmes was to push liquidity to NBFCs. Public sector banks purchased pooled assets of NBFCs worth Rs 1,453.16 crore during the month and also purchased <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NBFC">NBFC</a> assets worth Rs 2,876.95 crore under the government’s partial credit guarantee scheme.</p>
