      <p>CALGARY - Orlondo Steinuaer of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats is the CFL's coach of the year.</p>
      <p>Steinauer received the honour Thursday night at the CFL's awards banquet in voting conducted by the Football Reporters of Canada and nine league head coaches.</p>
      <p>Steinauer, 46, of Seattle, enjoyed a stellar first season with Hamilton, leading the Ticats to a CFL-best 15-3 record. Steinauer tied the CFL record for regular-season wins by a first-year head coach in guiding the Ticats to their best regular season in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Hamilton was a perfect 9-0 at home this year and led the league in scoring (551) while allowing the fewest points (344).</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan's Craig Dickenson was the finalist. The first-year head coach led the Riders (13-5) to first in the West Division for the first time since '09.</p>
