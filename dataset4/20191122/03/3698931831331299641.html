      <p>If you’re going for a long holiday overseas, <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/digi/">Digi</a> has just introduced a 7-day roaming pass for RM50. The pass is applicable for selected countries and it comes with free bundled calls.</p>
      <p>The 7-day pass gives you 4GB of data and 60 minutes of voice calls, but it is only available in 8 countries at the moment. This includes Australia, Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA. The pass has a 168-hours validity which is calculated from the time of activation.</p>
      <p>In terms of value, the 7-day pass is similar to the current 3-day pass that’s offered for RM25. The extra benefit is that you get an extra day of validity and this is great for casual data users.</p>

      <p>Digi also has introduced a 7-Day pass that covers mostly central and eastern European countries. It also costs RM50 for 168-hour validity but you only get 2GB of data with no voice calls included. This European pass is only available in 11 countries, namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovak Republic. We are told by Digi’s careline that you can use this single pass to roam across all 11 countries.</p>
      <p>For short term roaming, Digi is still offering the popular 3-day pass at RM25 which comes with 2GB of data and 30 minutes of calls. The pass is available in over 40 countries which include Singapore, Australia, China, the United Kingdom and the USA. If you connect to a Telenor network such as Grameenphone in Bangladesh, DTAC in Thailand and Telenor in Denmark, Myanmar, Norway, Pakistan and Sweden, you’ll get double the quota at 4GB for data and 60 minutes for voice calls.</p>
      <p>For those who are using a smartphone with <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2017/06/06/digi-enables-wifi-calling-voice-over-wifi-malaysia/">VoWiFi (aka WiFi Calling)</a> support, you can call back home at local rates when you’re connected to WiFi. However, do note that calls to foreign numbers will be based on Digi’s IDD rates. You can learn more about it <a href="https://www.digi.com.my/support/help-center/network/vowifi">here</a>.</p>
