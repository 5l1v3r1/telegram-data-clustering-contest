      <h1>Nobody Knows Where Fraser Anning Is</h1>

      <p>Once upon a time, people across Australia were crying out for Fraser Anning to scurry back to the rock he crawled out from under — and now it seems he’s done just that.</p>

      <p>It’s been months since Anning was voted out of Parliament, long enough for the rest of us to wonder whether his presence in the Senate was just some kind of horrific, collective, national nightmare.</p>
      <p>Now he’s in the headlines again, but for once it’s not for saying something <a href="https://junkee.com/fraser-anning-christchurch/198042">outrageously racist</a>.</p>
      <p>This time people are enjoying the supreme irony of Anning, who ran on a platform of nationalism, apparently fleeing the country to avoid bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
      <p>They’re being very sympathetic.</p>

      <p>As you may be aware, the former Senator is <a href="https://junkee.com/fraser-anning-bankruptcy/216698">facing bankruptcy</a> — again.</p>
      <p>A subsidiary of Bendigo Bank is chasing him for unpaid debts of $185,000 relating to a failed agribusiness scheme. This week they also applied for bankruptcy proceedings against his wife. The thing is, Anning kind of disappeared after his election loss and no one seems to know exactly where he is.</p>
      <p>Until they find him, bankers can’t serve him with the bankruptcy papers.</p>
      <p>Now his travel records are being subpoenaed from the Department of Home Affairs in an attempt to track him down.</p>

      <p>Yesterday there was a hearing in the Federal Circuit Court in Adelaide where the bank’s lawyer said they believed he was somewhere in the United States, where his daughters live.</p>

      <p>This is the second time Bendigo Bank has sought to bankrupt Anning — he settled the first case in October 2017, a month before entering Parliament.</p>
      <p>If his travel records don’t shed some light on where he is, one Twitter user had an idea:</p>

      <p>Truly, our hearts bleed for him.</p>
