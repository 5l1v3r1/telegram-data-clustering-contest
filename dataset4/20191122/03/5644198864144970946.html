      <p>JERUSALEM: Israel's embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted on a range of corruption charges on Thursday (Nov 21), potentially spelling an end to his decades-long political career.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit "decided to file charges against the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for offences of receiving a bribe, fraud, and breach of trust," a justice ministry statement said.</p>

      <p>Netanyahu, who strongly denies all the charges, becomes the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted while in office.</p>
      <p>Rightwinger Netanyahu, who is nicknamed "Mr. Security" and "King Bibi" and has been in power since 2009, is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and dominates the country's political scene.</p>
      <p>The indictment comes as Israel faces a potential third election in a year, with neither Netanyahu nor his main rival able to form a government after two deadlocked elections.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is not legally required to resign until he is convicted and all appeals are exhausted, but political pressure is likely to be intense.</p>
      <p>A close ally of US President Donald Trump, the 70-year-old may now ask the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to grant him immunity from prosecution.</p>
      <p>The charges against him range from receiving gifts worth thousands of dollars to a deal to change regulatory frameworks in favour of a media group in exchange for positive coverage.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit said it was a "hard and sad day" for Israel to indict a leader but it was an "important" one as it showed no Israeli was above the law.</p>
      <p>"The citizens of Israel, all of us, and myself, look up to the elected officials, and first and foremost - to the prime minister," Mandelblit said.</p>
      <p>He said the decision had been made with a "heavy heart, but also with a whole heart."</p>
      <p>"Law enforcement is not a choice. It is not a matter of right or left. It's not a matter of politics."</p>
      <p>He stressed that Netanyahu was innocent until proven guilty.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu was expected to respond later Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The justice ministry said copies of the charge sheet had been sent to both Netanyahu's lawyers and the Knesset.</p>
      <p>A perennial fighter, Netanyahu has outlived many political rivals and Hugh Lovatt, Israel-Palestine analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the indictment may still not be "the end of the story".</p>
      <p>"Israel will now have to brace for a political roller-coaster ride over the coming months. Now more than ever Netanyahu will be fighting for his political and personal life."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'WITCH-HUNT'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations, calling the corruption investigation a "witch-hunt" and alleging it has been motivated by his enemies' desire to force him from office.</p>
      <p>Of the three cases against Netanyahu, the third, known as Case 4,000, is seen as the most serious.</p>
      <p>He is alleged to have negotiated with Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Israeli telecommunications giant Bezeq, to get positive coverage on his Walla! news site in exchange for policies benefiting Bezeq.</p>
      <p>Elovitch and his wife were also indicted.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit indicted Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in this case.</p>
      <p>Case 1,000 involves allegations Netanyahu and his family received gifts including luxury cigars, champagne and jewellery from wealthy individuals, estimated to be worth more than 700,000 shekels (US$200,000), in exchange for financial or personal favours.</p>
      <p>Another case, known as Case 2000, concerns allegations Netanyahu sought a deal with the owner of the Yediot Aharonot newspaper that would have seen it give him more favourable coverage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'SAD DAY FOR ISRAEL'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next steps in the process remain unclear, with no date yet set for the trial.</p>
      <p>The country has also been without a government for nearly a year due to political infighting.</p>
      <p>Neither Likud leader Netanyahu nor rival Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White party, have been able to form a coalition government following deadlocked elections in April and September.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has remained prime minister in an interim capacity.</p>
      <p>The Knesset has 21 days remaining to find a candidate capable who can command the support of the majority of the country's 120 MPs and the indictment is likely to strengthen former army chief Gantz's claims.</p>
      <p>Gantz has reportedly tried to woo MP's from Netanyahu's Likud to join him in a broad national unity government, but there have so far been no takers.</p>
      <p>Gantz said Thursday evening the indictment of a sitting leader was a "very sad day for the State of Israel".</p>
      <p>Ofer Zalzberg, analyst with the International Crisis Group think-tank, said Netanyahu would be severely weakened by Mandelblit's announcement and could now face leadership challenges from within Likud.</p>
      <p>"Netanyahu has a weaker hand for the coming 20 days so may agree to compromises toward Blue and White he so far ruled out," he said.</p>
