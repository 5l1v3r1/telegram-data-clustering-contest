      <p>KOLKATA: Is day-night <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> the future for Tests? India skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> does not think so.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion, this should not become the only way Test cricket is played,” he said at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> on Thursday. "If that happens, you are losing out on the nervousness of the first session. You can bring excitement, but you can’t have Test cricket only for entertainment."</p>
      <p>Kohli has always maintained that Test match is the ultimate form of cricket, and refused to accept it is on the wane. Kohli and many others still feel the battle between bat and ball is the most challenging in Test cricket. "The entertainment of Test cricket lies in the batsman trying to survive a session and bowlers trying to set him up. If people don’t respond to that, too bad. Someone who gets a boost from this battle, in my opinion those are the ones who should come to watch, because they understand the game."</p>

      <p>Attendances in Test matches are gradually declining and innovations like day-night action with pink ball are required to keep it alive. But stalwarts continue to bat for the traditional form. "Rahul bhai mentioned about a Test calendar where series and Tests are fixed. It will be a lot more systematic and help people plan their calendar… It can’t be random. People will not leave work and come to Test, it has to be planned like anything in life," Kohli continued, reiterating his call for fixed Test centres.</p>

      <p>Kohli also spoke about taking special care of the Test specialists. "From the BCCI point of view, the only discussion in the last 3-4 years has been on how we can keep Test cricket right up there… that takes commitment from the board and players wanting to do everything to keep the standard high," he said. "In our contract system, a lot of importance is given to Test cricketers. You can’t tell players that they have to commit to playing Test cricket, but contractually nothing can be done for them. As Tests are said to be the most important format, everything around that has to happen in the same manner."</p>
      <p>In fact, telling the Test specialists that they are the most important players has been Kohli’s goal. "Other formats are taking care of themselves. You have so many people coming to play white-ball cricket, but Test specialists are very difficult to find. Only someone who has gone through the grind playing 5-6 years of firstclass cricket is the one who eventually makes it. I think these players need to be taken care of."</p>
