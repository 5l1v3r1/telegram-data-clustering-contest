      <p>A major investigation is underway after the body of a man was found inside a sleeping bag at a Tweed Heads park.</p>
      <p>A couple walking their dog made the grim discovery near the Jack Evans Boat Harbour Park on Coral Street about 11.00am Friday NSW time.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews rushed to the park, where they quickly established a crime scene.</p>
      <p>It’s believed the man is aged in his 50s, however a post mortem will be conducted in the coming day to determine his cause of death and identity.</p>
      <p>Tweed Detectives have swarmed the area and are currently conducting a canvas, with detectives from State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad also called in to investigate the circumstances surrounding the man’s death.</p>
      <p>Police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
