      <p>Several alleged <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/chinese-smartphones">Redmi</a> K30 real-life <a href="https://www.weibo.com/6561933432/IhmQuserq?type=comment#_rnd1574414806895">images surfaced</a>, and one of them seemingly confirms a 120Hz display will be included. That's not all, though, these images reveal even more information.</p>
      <p>On top of the display refresh rate confirmation, these images also suggest the phone will be fueled by the Snapdragon 730G 64-bit octa-core SoC. This is one of Qualcomm's most powerful mid-range processors.</p>
      <h3>Redmi K30 real-life images reveal 120Hz display, the Snapdragon 730G &amp; more</h3>
      <p>All of this info got revealed via three Redmi K30 real-life images that you can check out down below. On one of those images, AIDA64 is running, and it clearly reveals a 120Hz display refresh rate.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>On top of that, it confirms that the phone will feature a large fullHD+ (2400 x 1080) display. Considering AIDA64 is in Chinese, we're not sure if the '6.66' part is the display size, but it's possible.</p>
      <h3>An option to choose between 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rate</h3>
      <p>In any case, one of the images even reveals an option to choose between a 60Hz refresh rate, and 120Hz option. Interestingly enough, a 90Hz option is not included here.</p>
      <p>The Redmi K30 is packed into a heavy-duty case in these images. This is not your regular case, but a case that is meant to hide the phone's design. The only thing we can see here is the phone's display, unfortunately. That display is somewhat revealing as well, though. As you can see, a pill-shaped display camera hole is included.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This display camera hole not only looks like the one on the Galaxy S10+, but it's also placed in the same spot, the top-right corner of the display. That display hole is not small, though, and it's quite distracting.</p>
      <p>The Redmi K20 and K20 Pro did not include a display hole or a notch, so this may seem like a step down in design to some of you. Many people will be glad that a motorized pop-up camera is no longer a part of the design, but considering such an unseemly display hole is now present… well, that may disappoint quite a few people.</p>
      <p>Nothing has been confirmed just yet, though, of course. It is still possible this is not the Redmi K30, but that's not as likely. In any case, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

      <h3>Redmi's K30 series is coming next month, available from January</h3>
      <p>The Redmi K20 and K20 Pro were introduced back in May. The Redmi K30 and K30 Pro will not follow in May 2020. It was recently confirmed that the Redmi K30 will launch in December, which is quite interesting.</p>
      <p>Redmi's General Manager did say that the phone will become available for purchase in January, though. That's not all, though, it was also confirmed that the Redmi K30 will arrive with 5G support. Redmi will probably introduce both 4G and 5G models, though.</p>
      <p>What's interesting here, is that these rumors suggest that the Redmi K30 will include a 120Hz display, not only the Redmi K30 Pro. That is commendable, of course, and it seems like Redmi is turning its attention to high refresh rate displays as well.</p>
