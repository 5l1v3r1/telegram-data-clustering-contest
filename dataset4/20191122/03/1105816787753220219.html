      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:56:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/1602/rameez-khan/" target="_blank">Rameez Khan</a></address>
      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Reports of split within the government as claimed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman were quashed as Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, also the coalition partner of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Punjab and at Centre, called on Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar on Thursday with both the leaders renewing their vows during the two-hour-long meeting.</p>
      <p>According to the Chief Minister’s office, Pervaiz Elahi said that Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) would always stand with Usman Buzdar.</p>
      <p>“No one should have any misunderstanding. We are an ally of the PTI and our alliance is stronger than before. Those trying to weaken our alliance will not succeed,” Elahi said.</p>
      <p>“The past government caused a great loss to the people by closing the public welfare projects of my era,” he lamented.</p>
      <p>“It is better to solve every problem through consultation.”</p>
      <p>He said that merit and good governance rules the province instead of personal likes and dislikes.</p>
      <p>“We will jointly work to provide relief to the people as Chief Minister Usman Buzdar is serving the province,” he resolved.</p>
      <p>This was the second time PML-Q leader Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi had to publicly dispel the impression of any difference with their lead partner in the government.</p>
      <p>Earlier on November 17, Elahi said that no conspiracy theory would work to create differences between the allies, further stating that “We will remain the coalition partners and no one will be able to create misunderstandings”.</p>
      <p>PML-Q leader and Federal Minister for Housing Tariq Bashir Cheema, who was also present in the meeting, said there was and is no difference between the PML-Q and PTI and all the rumors being spread in this regard were baseless.</p>
      <p>“Since there are no differences, the meeting taking place to control any damage is a pointless speculation,” he remarked.</p>
      <p>Cheema said that the meeting between Punjab Assembly speaker and Punjab chief minister was due for the past five to six weeks and since both sides were busy with political engagements, the moot could not take place earlier.</p>
      <p>He stated that not a single issue related to politics or sit-in was discussed during consultations between the two leaders.</p>
      <p>“We may have different views then about the government on many issues but that does not mean we have any difference,” he maintained.</p>
      <p>Cheema declared that there were several issues of administrative nature that were discussed in the meeting and media reports were based on rumours.</p>
      <p>Son of Pervaiz Elahi, MNA Monis Elahi was also in attendance.</p>
      <p>Buzdar hailed Elahi for administering the Punjab Assembly affairs in an efficient manner. Both agreed to continue working jointly for the betterment of the people.</p>
      <p>The chief minister said that the relationship between PTI and PML-Q would be strengthened with every passing moment.</p>
      <p>“We will jointly continue serving the people and conspiracies of those trying to create misunderstandings will not succeed,” he clarified.</p>
      <p>“We have undertaken such public welfare tasks which the past rulers have failed to perform even in years. The period of befooling the people with empty slogans is over,” he noted.</p>
      <p>“The new local bodies system will give a new dimension to public service and it will provide relief to the common man,” he added.</p>
      <p>Buzdar said that record legislation had been done in a short period of time by the Punjab government.</p>
      <p>“Around 28 bills and acts aimed at welfare of people have been passed by the Punjab Assembly,” he said.</p>
