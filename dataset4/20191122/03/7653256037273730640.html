      <p>Jaipur boy <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mayank-Pratap-Singh">Mayank Pratap Singh</a>, has made history by cracking the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajasthan-judicial-services">Rajasthan judicial services</a> 2018 exam at just 21 years of age, which has set him on the path of becoming the youngest judge in the country.</p>
      <p>"I was always drawn towards the judicial services going by the importance and respect reserved for the judges in the society. I took admission in 2014 in the five-year LLB course from the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajasthan-University">Rajasthan University</a>, which ended this year," Singh told on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I am elated with my success and I thank my family, teachers and all well-wishers for their contribution which helped me crack the exam in the first attempt," he added.</p>
      <p>The original age requirement for appearing in the judicial services exam was 23 years, which had been reduced to 21 years by the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajasthan-High-Court">Rajasthan High Court</a> in 2019.</p>
      <p>Singh said that it was a good move as it would help fill vacancies of the posts lying vacant and said it would also help him help more people throughout his career.</p>
      <p>"I could appear in the exam only because the minimum age was reduced. Had it not been so then I would not have been eligible. I think it will benefit me because now I will get more time to learn and do more work and serve more people in my career because I joined at such a young age," he added.</p>
