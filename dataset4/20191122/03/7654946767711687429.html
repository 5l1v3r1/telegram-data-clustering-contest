      <p>A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/fbi-fisa-russia-investigation/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Trump and his supporters have repeatedly claimed the security agencies took shady steps in their investigation into his 2016 campaign’s relationship with Russia.</p>
      <p>The evidence of the fudged document was turned over to Durham by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is conducting a review on how FISA warrants were obtained against Page.</p>
