      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Former <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Minnesota-Vikings/?tps=1">Minnesota Vikings</a> kicker Fred Cox, who was the co-creator of the Nerf football, died Wednesday at the age of 80, the team announced.</p>
      <p>Cox was discharged from the hospital earlier this month and placed into hospice care because of heart and kidney problems, according to the <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/11/21/former-vikings-kicker-fred-cox-dies-im-a-guy-that-lived-a-long-and-really-good-life/">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>.</p>
      <p>"The Vikings mourn the loss of Fred Cox, one of our proudest legends and a member of the 50 Greatest Vikings," the team said <a href="https://www.vikings.com/news/vikings-mourn-passing-of-legendary-kicker-nerf-football-inventor-fred-cox?sf224245807=1">in a statement</a> Thursday. "A respected teammate and friend, Fred's football career as the Vikings all-time leading scorer set the stage for a life where he went on to achieve great things in business and in his community.</p>
      <p>"Fred's positive energy, strength in his faith and passion for life will be missed."</p>
      <p>Cox never missed a game in 15 seasons playing for the Vikings from 1963-77. His 15 seasons are tied for the third-longest tenure in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Cox finished his career with 1,365 points, the most in Vikings history. He led the team in points for 11 consecutive seasons (1963-73) and won the final NFL Championship Game in 1969. He also played in four Super Bowls with the Vikings.</p>
      <p>When Cox retired from the league, he ranked second in NFL history in scoring behind quarterback and kicker George Blanda.</p>

      <p>In 1972, while still a member of the Vikings, Cox collaborated with partner and local entrepreneur John Mattox to create a soft football to prevent leg injuries to kids. The result was the Nerf football.</p>
      <p>Cox went to the University of Pittsburgh and was drafted as a running back by the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland-Browns/?tps=1">Cleveland Browns</a>. He shifted to kicker due to a back injury and learned under Lou Groza.</p>
      <p>Cox later became a chiropractor and operated a successful practice in Minnesota before retiring at age 50.</p>
