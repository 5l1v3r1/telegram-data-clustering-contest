      <p>The latest leak in our exclusive coverage of Nokia 2.3 reveals new pricing and also we hear from our sources that Nokia 2.3 will have a 2GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage variant. This means Nokia 2.3 will offer more storage for the same RAM variant as Nokia 2.2 and 3.2 only have a 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage variant.</p>
      <p>As one can notice in the screenshot in featured image above Nokia 2.3 is priced at EUR 93.99. So, it seems that HMD will keep it priced under EUR 100 just like Nokia 2.2.</p>
      <p>We have been reporting about HMDâ€™s plans to <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/exclusive-nokia-2-3-ta-1206-leaks-via-a-distributor-database-color-variants-mediatek-processor-revealed/">launch Nokia 2.3</a> with improved specs and features over Nokia 2.2. The leaked screenshot from distributor databse has also revealed Nokia 2.3 color variants.</p>
      <p>All these sightings hint at a sooner launch for the smartphones. Surprisingly there are no signs of any other Nokia smartphone including <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-5-2/">Nokia 5.2</a> and <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-9-1-pureview/">Nokia 9.1</a> anywhere.</p>
      <p>Nokia 2.3 may come with a display size of greater than 6.1-inch with HD resolution. It features a bigger battery of 3920 mAH capacity as compared to Nokia 2.2. Nokia 2.3 also comes with Bluetooth 5.0 as compared to Bluetooth 4.2 on Nokia 2.2.</p>
