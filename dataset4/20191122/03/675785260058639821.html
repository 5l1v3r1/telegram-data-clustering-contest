      <h1>Deadly new disease can 'infect and ruin world's coral reefs'</h1>
      <h2>Grey-patch disease can envelop live coral and has been found in Micronesia across 18 different species of coral</h2>

      <p>A deadly new disease is threatening to infect and ruin the world's coral reefs, warns a new study.</p>
      <p>Known as grey-patch disease, it alters the community of microbes found on the host coral by forming a film of bacteria which envelops the live coral.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the University of Derby and the University of Guam surveyed reefs across the Indian and Pacific Oceans between 2011 and 2018 for signs of the new disease.</p>
      <p>Although the scientists found that grey-patch is currently restricted to Micronesia, it was found across 18 different species of coral and nearly 22 per cent of surveyed colonies.</p>

      <p>The disease is apparently slow to progress, meaning that some coral tissue was able to grow back over the biofilm.</p>
      <p>Study lead author Dr Michael Sweet said: "Upon analysis of the coral samples, multiple microorganisms appeared to be involved in degrading the corals' defences causing the onset of the disease.</p>
      <p>"This supports recent findings that suggest we should shift from the one-pathogen-one-disease model, to exploring the importance of multiple pathogens in any given disease."</p>

      <p>Each coral's microbiome - the distinct community of microbes hosted by corals - was significantly affected by the infection.</p>
      <p>However, when comparing microbiomes across different corals, those with the disease were found to be more similar with regard to their community profiles.</p>
      <p>Dr Sweet added: "Our analysis highlighted the clustering of specific microbes. Identifying these clusters may be a useful tool for assessing coral health at any given time.</p>

      <p>"We found that in healthy coral tissue, 'infection clusters' were seen in advance of physical signs of the disease. We were also able to identify 'survival clusters' in diseased tissue.</p>
      <p>"These appeared to be essential to the health of the coral and these good bacteria appeared to compete against the disease-causing microbes, allowing certain corals to recover and survive.</p>
      <p>"We are now interested in exploring if these microbes may be cultured and used as probiotics to assist corals in overcoming the impacts of climate change."</p>
      <p>The findings were published in the journal Microbiome.</p>
