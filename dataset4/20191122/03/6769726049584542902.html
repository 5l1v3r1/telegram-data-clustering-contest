      <h1>Perth’s best place to get a cocktail</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:58:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:58</time> by <a rel="author">Victoria Rifici</a></address>
      <p>TIKI as FK in Northbridge has emerged as the best place to get a cocktail.</p>
      <p>It won the cocktail bar award and employee Bjorn Karason won the cocktail bartender award at the 2019 Australian Hotels Association and Aon Hospitality Awards for Excellence.</p>
      <p>Scarborough resident Mr Karason, who has worked at the rum-based cocktail bar since its opening in 2017, said it was a “tremendous honour” to receive the prestigious award.</p>
      <p>“I love the engagement with our clients – I get paid to put on a party,” he said.</p>
      <p>“People just want to come in and have a good time and it’s my job to facilitate and make that happen.</p>
      <p>“Our engagement with our clientele we do best; the bar is not a barrier between us and our guests so we very much engage and have a high interest in introducing guests to each other as well. Our aim is to create a little community.”</p>

      <p>More than 40 awards were presented at the ceremony at Crown Towers earlier this month.</p>
      <p>AHA (WA) chief executive Bradley Woods said the 2019 finalists and winners represented the pinnacle of hospitality venues throughout WA.</p>
      <p>“WA’s hospitality industry continues to grow from strength to strength and the quality of the finalists reflects the exceptional standards for which WA is increasingly renowned,” Mr Woods said.</p>
      <p>“The awards are an opportunity to acknowledge those venues that constantly strive to raise the bar, as well as their dedicated staff who are the backbone of the industry.</p>
      <p>“Our hospitality industry is in many ways the face of WA – venues and staff across the state play a critical role in how we are perceived and in this regard the industry is excelling.”</p>
