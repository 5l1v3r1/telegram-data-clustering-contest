      <p>Pharma major <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/lupin-ltd/overview/">Lupin Limited</a> on Friday announced the launch of “ADHERO,” a new connected smart device for metered-dose inhalers. This first-of-its-kind device is designed to help patients with chronic respiratory diseases to track their MDI usage and facilitate improved adherence to therapy.</p>
      <p>Inhalers are the preferred treatment option for managing the rising incidence of Chronic respiratory diseases like Asthma and COPD in India. However, it is estimated that nearly 45 per cent of patients do not adhere to therapy which adversely impacts clinical outcomes and patient quality of life.</p>
      <p>The new device, ADHERO, is designed to improve patient adherence to therapy. Lupin has collaborated with Aptar Pharma, a provider of drug delivery devices, components and services in bringing this first in the class device to market.</p>

      <h3>Power sector: Focus on other pain points</h3>
      <p>On the face of it, media reports painted a scary picture. One report mentioned that as many as 262 thermal power units had shut down operations by early November. Many of them have been shut for weeks. Another report said Coal India’s output fell to its lowest in six years in September on account of heavy rains. Not just that. Its coal shipment that month was a five-year low.</p>
      <p>Central Electricity Authority (CEA) data revealed that the plant load factor (PLF) of thermal units in the April-September 2019 period (at 57.67 per cent) was the lowest in a decade. Even worse, by end-September it had dropped further to 51 per cent. <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/power-sector-focus-on-other-pain-points/article30040426.ece?homepage=true">Click here to read the insight</a></p>

      <h4>Rising broker defaults: How to claim your money</h4>
      <p>Defaults by brokers in India’s stock markets is on the rise. In a majority of cases, it has been found that distressed stock brokers who have lost heavily, often in the derivative segments, even offload client collateral to fulfill their obligation to the clearing corporation. The proceeds from the sale of client shares is not returned to the ultimate beneficiary.</p>
      <p>The Allied Financial and IL&amp;FS cases are the most recent examples of such practice. As of now, there is no segregation of client and broker collateral placed with the clearing corporation. <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/rising-broker-defaults-how-to-claim-your-money-back/article30046420.ece">Read more here</a></p>

      <h4>CSB Bank IPO: Should you subscribe?</h4>
      <p>Amid the ongoing challenges in the banking sector, the initial public offering (IPO) of CSB Bank (formerly known as Catholic Syrian Bank) lends little comfort. Kerala-based CSB Bank is one of the oldest private sector banks, with a focus on SME, gold loans and an NRI client base.</p>
      <p>The bank moved into the black in the first half of the current fiscal, and its capital position got a boost in FY19 and this fiscal from the ₹1,200-crore investment by FIH Mauritius Investments (FIHM) — a wholly owned subsidiary of Fairfax India Holdings Corporation— at ₹140 per share. <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/stock-fundamental-analysis-india/csb-bank-ipo-should-you-subscribe/article30037498.ece">Click here to read our recommendations</a></p>

      <h4>Broker's call: <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/housing-development-finance-corporation-ltd/overview/">HDFC</a> (Buy)</h4>
      <p>
        <b>JM Financial</b>
      </p>
      <p>With the subsidiaries coming of age, we believe the solid core HFC story of HDFC has got lost in translation. Currently, the core HFC is trading at its low historical valuation of 1.35x one-yr fwd PBV.</p>
      <p>HDFC is a compelling BUY opportunity given</p>
      <p>a) superior liability franchise with the largest deposit base within the NBFC space,</p>
      <p>b) best placed to benefit from lower rates and normalisation of credit spreads going ahead (c.130bps credit spread on 3-year paper vs 90bps two years ago),</p>
      <p>c) poised to maintain retail home loan market share while selectively increase market share in corporate segment especially developer finance as 35% of the overall market (incl. banks) is either defocusing/recalibrating their strategy/reeling under capital constraints,</p>
      <p>d) ability to maintain spreads over the years despite an increase in the share of low yielding individual loans by 400bps over the last two years to an all-time high of 76% and</p>
      <p>e) best in class asset quality in a challenging environment with the possible monetisation of investments providing an adequate cushion against asset quality shocks (for, e.g. Bandhan Bank stake is valued at Rs 8,400 crore which is 2.2x NS3 assets as of Sep’19).</p>
      <p>We expect AUM CAGR of 13% over FY19-21E with earnings CAGR of 17%. HDFC is our top pick in the HFC space and a compelling BUY with a target price of Rs 2,700.</p>

      <h4>Broker's call: <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/ntpc-ltd/overview/">NTPC </a>(Buy)</h4>
      <p>JM Financial</p>
      <p>Cabinet committee of economic affairs (CCEA) has given in-principal approval for the sale of Government's holding in NEEPCO (100% - GoI holding ) and THDC India Ltd (75% holding) to NTPC. </p>
      <p><b>Impact on NTPC:</b> Acquisition of these new capacities (including under-construction) adds c.5 GW (10% of NTPC capacity) of mostly hydropower assets to NTPC’s largely coal dominated asset base. THDC is the better assets with superior RoEs while NEEPCO is sub-optimal. Hence, its acquisition value should also reflect the same. Also, a higher debt-funded acquisition would be more value accretive for NTPC, given it has access to low-cost debt. We find both additions to be earnings accretive for NTPC at the fair value and with a) NTPC’s strong balance sheet (FY19 net D/E at 1.3x) and b) annual profits of INR 100- 120bn these are easily funded from 2-3 years of internal accruals.</p>

      <h4>Daily Rupee call: Initiate long position at 71.9</h4>
      <p>On Thursday, the rupee (INR) ended the session with a marginal gain. It closed at 71.76 versus its previous close of 71.81 against the dollar (USD). Even though the exchange rate of USDINR remains within a broad range between 71.6 and 72, the currency pair traded in a tighter range between 71.7 and 71.9 in the past two trading sessions, continuing with its sluggish price action. <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/technical-analysis/daily-rupee-call-initiate-long-position-at-719/article30046611.ece">Read more on the technical call here</a></p>
