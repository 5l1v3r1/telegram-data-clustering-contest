      <h1>Islanders set a franchise record in OT win over Penguins</h1>

      <p>It was fitting. Almost expected.</p>
      <p>Of course the Islanders came from behind. Of course they trailed twice. And of course they found a way to prevail despite those deficits, in spite of coughing up the lead in the final half-minute of regulation.</p>
      <p>These days nothing can stop coach Barry Trotz’s team, which set a franchise mark Thursday night at Barclays Center by registering a point in a 16th straight game, knocking off the Penguins, 4-3 in overtime, on the second of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/a-milestone-night-for-islanders-brock-nelson/">two Brock Nelson goals</a>.</p>
      <p>In doing so, they surpassed Islanders teams in 1978, 1980 and 1982 that had notched points in 15 consecutive games, improving to 15-0-1 over this dizzying stretch after starting the season with three losses in four games.</p>
      <p>“It’s huge, a lot of history with this organization,” defenseman Scott Mayfield said. “To set a record, it’s not easy to do. We did it. Proud of it. We just got to keep going.”</p>
      <p>Many of the constants of the streak were on display Thursday night. There was the Isles’ resilience from the two one-goal deficits, winning for the eighth time in this run after allowing the first goal. There was Thomas Greiss, one half of their sturdy goaltending duo, making 23 saves, keeping his team in it. There was the continued balanced attack, with the goals coming from Nelson, Anthony Beauvillier and Mayfield.</p>

      <p>“It’s really cool,” Beauvillier said. “We made history with this group of guys. This streak’s been a lot of fun.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t perfect. There were pockets of sloppy play, particularly at the outset of the first and second periods. But it was consistent, winning hockey nevertheless, the kind that has pushed the Islanders (16-3-1, 36 points) to within three points of the Metropolitan Division-leading Capitals, that has elevated this team experts thought would regress to a furious start to this season and the highest winning percentage in the NHL.</p>
      <p>Typical of this workmanlike group, they took the record-setting victory in stride. There was no celebrating. Unprompted, Mayfield talked about the need for better starts. Trotz seemed frustrated by the finish, allowing the division-rival Penguins to gain a point. There isn’t a focus on the streak.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t even really feel like we’ve won that many games,” Mathew Barzal said. “It just kind of feels like we’re a quarter way through the season. There’s some games there maybe we shouldn’t have won and games we just found a way to win. That’s what we’ve done the last three games, just find a way to win, stay with it and grind, and just try to get some bounces.”</p>
      <p>Added Trotz: “This group just stays in the moment. They come to work, they come to compete every night and they give you their best effort. That’s sort of the Islander way.”</p>
      <p>In his 500th career game, Nelson was the hero, scoring twice in the final 10 minutes of play. He gave the Isles the lead with 4:52 left in regulation, scoring off his own faceoff win on the power play. After Patric Hornqvist put home the rebound of an Evgeni Malkin shot, forcing overtime, Nelson did it again, beating Penguins goalie Matt Murray with a sharp-angle backhand 43.5 seconds before a shootout would have been needed. That response was just the latest example of the Islanders’ resilience. Nothing seems to faze this group.</p>
      <p>“We don’t really care,” Barzal said. “It’s just about the next shift. It doesn’t matter what the other team does.”</p>
