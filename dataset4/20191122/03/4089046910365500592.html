      <p><b>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT/WTVF) -- </b>Nashville Mayor John Cooper has said he will foster an animal for a day each month at his downtown office.</p>
      <p>Metro Animal Care and Control has made an initiative called the Bow Wow Breakout program in order to give these animals a break from shelter life.</p>
      <p>Delilah, a 2-year-old brown Labrador retriever is set to be the first animal Mayor Cooper will foster.</p>
      <p>"You never know, they might just find their forever home, and you might find yourself being rescued," Cooper told WTVF.</p>
