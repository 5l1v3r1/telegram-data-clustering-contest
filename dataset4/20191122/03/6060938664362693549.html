      <h1>Ajay Devgn starrer 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior' threatened by MLA; asks director Om Raut to make immediate changes?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:26:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:26</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>The trailer of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajay-Devgn">Ajay Devgn</a>'s ambitious film, '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tanhaji:-The-Unsung-Warrior">Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</a>' was launched this week. It garnered immense praise from all quarters. The film recently made headlines when <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/maharashtra-navnirman-sena">MNS</a> supported the release of the film and said: “should be dubbed in as many languages as possible.” Over the past several years, the party has banned the dubbing of Hindi films into Marathi, claiming that they will eat into the business of Marathi offerings. Amey Khopkar, who heads the MNS' film wing, said that the party has decided to make an exception for the war drama. The film will be dubbed in Marathi as it will increase the audience in the state and across the country.</p>

      <p>Now, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/nationalist-congress-party">NCP</a> MLA <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jitendra-Awhad">Jitendra Awhad</a> took to his <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> handle to claim that the film has certain flaws and that needs to be corrected or he will tackle the matter in his own way. According to him, the director Om Raut has taken cinematic liberty too far and it needs to be rectified. If he fails to do so, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/member-of-legislative-assembly">MLA</a> will take the matters in his own hands. He further added that he would not mind if they consider this as a threat.</p>
