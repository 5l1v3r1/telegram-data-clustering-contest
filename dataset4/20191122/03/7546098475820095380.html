      <h1>Goldman Sachs tips Suncorp shares as a buy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:35:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/tmfdelboy/" target="_blank">Tom Richardson</a></address>
      <p>The<b> Suncorp Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Suncorp+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-SUN">(ASX: SUN)</a> share price is down 4.5% over the last 12 months, but there could be gains ahead if the analysts at Goldman Sachs are on the money. </p>
      <p>On November 18 the analysts ran the ruler over Suncorp’s trading update provided at a UBS Australia institutional investor conference.</p>
      <p>Suncorp did not provide any specific guidance, but Goldman’s is forecasting that it will earn 88 cents per share over FY 2020.</p>
      <p>That places it on 14.9x Goldman’s estimate of earnings with a 5.5% yield if Goldman’s estimate for 72 cents per share in dividends over FY 2020 is accurate.</p>
      <p>This looks good value for a business generally regarded as ‘blue chip’, when compared to some of the racy valuations other blue chips like <b>Coles Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Coles+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-COL">(ASX: COL)</a> or<b> Woolworths Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Woolworths+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-WOW">(ASX: WOW)</a> are printing. </p>
      <p>However, as Goldman’s points out banks and insurers are facing more regulatory pressure, while earnings can vary wildly depending on claims expenses.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere Goldman’s is neutral on <b>QBE Insurance Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/QBE+Insurance+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-QBE">(ASX: QBE)</a> and <b>Insurance Australia Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Insurance+Australia+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-IAG">(ASX: IAG)</a>.</p>
