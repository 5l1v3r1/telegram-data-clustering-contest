      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> hierarchy reacted with ‘intrigued silence’ at the news that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> had returned to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> management with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old made his return after 11 months out of the game by signing a three-and-a-half year deal with Tottenham on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s been out of work since his tumultuous sacking at Old Trafford last December and a clause in his departure prevented him from speaking about his exit during his stint with Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>United, of course, expected him to return to management but the expectation was that he would seek a future away from the Premier League.</p>

      <p>And the Independent claim that United’s board were caught by surprise by the news that he’d been appointed by Tottenham and reacted with ‘intrigued silence’.</p>

      <p>Reports claim Mourinho was not Spurs’ first choice to replace Pochettino but the Portuguese ‘blew away’ club officials with his pitch for the role.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was said to have shown a clear plan for where he sees the team going and what players he plans to buy and sell in the next 18 months.</p>
      <p>Spurs take on West Ham at the London Stadium in Mourinho’s first game on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has taken training in the last two days and all eyes will be on the starting XI he selects in east London.</p>
