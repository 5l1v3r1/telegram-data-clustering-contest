      <h1>Twitter rewrites history with hilarious pop culture meme 'gonna tell my kids'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:32:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:32</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter">Twitter</a> users are hilariously rewriting the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history">history</a> books with the Internet’s latest trending topic, “Gonna tell my kids.”</p>
      <p>The funny meme works sort of like a white lie <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting">parents</a> tell their kids -- but it involves taking a historic or popular figure and replacing the person with a random image of a pop star or cultural event.</p>
      <p>Part of the magic is to pick the perfect doppelganger or image that best captures the desired feeling.</p>

      <p>One viral <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksholiday/status/1196655828029366272">tweet,</a> for example, showed a frog sitting on top of a toy horse with a cowboy hat Photoshopped on its head. The caption read: “im gonna tell my kids this was lil nas x.”</p>
      <p>Another photo of singer Lana Del Rey and rapper A$AP Rocky was paired with the tweet “gonna tell my kids this was jfk and Jacqueline Kennedy.”</p>

      <p>One of the funnier posts was a video of Cardi B. “Gonna tell my kids this was Audrey Hepburn,” one Twitter user posted.</p>
      <p>“I’m gonna tell my kids this is the royal family,” one person tweeted with an image of the Lindsay Lohan-led cast of “The Parent Trap.”</p>
      <p>Of course, there were some pretty great political tweets. On one, next to an image of Betty White, a Twitter user wrote, “Gonna tell my kids this was Joe Biden.”</p>
