      <p>It will be a real test of character for the title-chasing sides, as derbies tend to be unpredictable.</p>
      <p>Bragging rights are always at the core of derbies and that’s what brews excitement in such encounters.</p>

      <p>Action starts tomorrow, with relegation fighting Bulawayo Chiefs, known for their giant killing acts, taking on Chicken Inn at Luveve Stadium. On Sunday, FC Platinum are involved in a Midlands derby against Chapungu at Ascot Stadium in Gweru.</p>
      <p>The biggest derby is no doubt the clash between Harare rivals, Caps United and Dynamos at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Caps United top the league table with 55 points from 31 games and have been blowing hot and cold, a condition they can’t afford to display against Dynamos, who are unbeaten in 20 games, as they angle for a top four finish.</p>
      <p>DeMbare are fifth with 44 points, two points behind fourth-placed ZPC Kariba, who take on Triangle United at Gibbo Stadium.</p>
      <p>Caps United surrendered a two-goal lead last weekend to draw 2-2 against relegation-threatened Yadah, while Dynamos drew 0-0 with army side, Black Rhinos.</p>
      <p>Matches between Caps United and Dynamos have always produced fireworks, and with the former having “wished” DeMbare to be relegated last season, the blue army might spoil Makepekepe’s title charge.</p>
      <p>In the first-leg, the two sides drew 1-1, but a draw would be like a loss for Caps United, as Chicken Inn and FC Platinum are breathing heavily on their neck, waiting for a chance to pounce.</p>
      <p>Caps United will bank on arguably their best player this season midfielder Joel Ngodzo, utility player Valentine Ndaba, defensive midfielder Dominic Mukandi and forwards Dominic Chungwa and John Zhuwawu to lead them against their old foes.</p>
      <p>Dynamos’ hope will be pinned on young goalkeeper, Simba Chinani, right-back Emmanuel Jalai, midfielder Kudzanai Dhemere, strikers Ngandu Mangala and Evans Katema.</p>
      <p>Chicken Inn registered a disappointing 1-1 draw against lowly-placed Hwange last weekend, and will be hoping to get the better of Bulawayo Chiefs, who are smarting from a 1-0 defeat away to Manica Diamonds.</p>
      <p>Chiefs and Chicken Inn are meeting for the third time since the former gained promotion into the Premiership. Last season, Chicken Inn won the first-leg 2-0 before losing the reverse fixture 1-0. Their first encounter this year was claimed by the Gamecocks in a 2-0 score line.</p>
      <p>With both teams in desperate need for the three points — for Chicken Inn to aid their title fight and for Chiefs to escape relegation —nothing short of a thriller should be on display at Luveve Stadium.</p>
      <p>In Gweru, Chapungu will be looking for their first ever win over FC Platinum in the league.</p>
      <p>The two Midlands sides have faced each other 11 times in the league, with FC Platinum winning eight the other three ending in stalemates.</p>
      <p>Defending the title and the possibility of keeping the PSL cup for good as well as earning another ticket to the Caf Champions League could be driving FC Platinum not to lose hope and keep fighting.</p>
      <p>On their last three visits to Gweru, FC Platinum won all games by identical 2-0 score lines.</p>
      <p>Chapungu are just four points above the relegation zone with 39 points thus are not out of the woods yet, as they are only four points above Chiefs, who occupy the last relegation slot.</p>
