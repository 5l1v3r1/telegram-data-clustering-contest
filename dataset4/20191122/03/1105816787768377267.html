      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has inducted the first aircraft under its fresh plan of fleet expansion.</p>
      <p>“PIA has acquired two A320 aircraft on dry lease from Aviation Lease and Finance Company,” said PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan. “The first aircraft reached Karachi on Thursday while the second A320 will be delivered by the end of this year.”</p>
      <p>In August, Prime Minister Imran Khan had approved the purchase of 12 new airplanes for addition to the PIA’s existing fleet by 2023.</p>
      <p>“Airlines in Pakistan are operating at 90% occupancy rate and we are hopeful that following the induction of new airplanes, the demand will remain the same,” said the PIA spokesperson. “PIA is catering to 60% of the local demand and hopes to increase the share with the addition of new aircraft.”</p>

      <p>Speaking at the arrival of A320, PIA Chief Executive Officer Air Marshal Arshad Malik said the airline had planned to add fuel-efficient aircraft to its fleet in order to introduce new routes and increase the frequency of flights.</p>
      <p>He was of the view that the fuel-efficient aircraft would not only aid in revenue generation and facilitate passengers but would also help improve flight regularity and punctuality. He pointed out that the second A320 would arrive in December.<i> </i></p>
