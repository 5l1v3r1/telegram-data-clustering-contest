        <b>THE Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) has increased revenue it collects from tourism by about 60-percent in the last four years, thanks to various efforts to reach out to new markets and increase inflows of tourists from 957,576 in 2015/16 to 1, 141 462 in 2018/19.</b>

      <p>Speaking at a press conference yesterday, TANAPA Conservation Commissioner Dr Allan Kijazi said the authority collected 175.bn/- in the 2015/16 financial year, 207.5bn/- in the 2016/17, 254.7bn/- 2017/18 and 279.4bn/- in 2018/19 which comes to about 60-percent rise compared to 2015/16 earnings.</p>
      <p>“We have managed to increase the number of tourists by about 19.2percent in the last four years which translates into higher contribution to the national economy,” said Dr Kijazi.</p>
      <p>Dr Kijazi who was speaking to announce achievements that the authority has made in the four years of President John Magufuli’s leadership said TANAPA has increased its contribution to the Treasury from 31bn/- in 2016/17 to 42bn/- in 2018/19 financial year.</p>
      <p>TANAPA set aside 111.3bn/- for implementation of development projects from the 2016/17 financial year to 2018/19, he said.</p>
      <p>“The projects include strengthening tourism services including construction of hostels for accommodation of tourists, houses for servants and purchasing boats and vehicles as well as boosting flights for tourism purposes,” he elaborated.</p>
      <p>Dr Kijaji said during the four years TANAPA has strengthened security systems for wildlife protection, enabling a rise in the number of animals that are listed as facing extinction such as rhinos, registering a 10-percent increase on the back of control of poaching activities, going down by about 90-percent.</p>
      <p>Dr Kijazi said during the period 14,464 poachers were arrested and taken to various courts countrywide.</p>
      <p>In 2017 the government launched three bodies to oversee tourism licensing processes in a new drive to boost the number of visitors to two million by 2020.</p>
      <p>The Tanzania Tourism Licensing Board (TTLB), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and the Tourism Appeals Authority (TAA) are responsible for advising the government, handle appeals and issue operating licenses to tour operators to sanitize the key economic sector.</p>
      <p>Tourism licensing is premised on ensuring customer satisfaction and competitiveness of the country as a tourist destination and managing customer expectations by maintaining minimally acceptable service provision standards.</p>
      <p>It also helps to bring order to the sector as it is a deterrent to unscrupulous businessmen since punitive measures are taken against those who contravene laws.</p>
      <p>Tourism employs about a third of Tanzania’s work force and contributed 13- per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, making it a vital industry for a nation of more than 50 million people that needs more jobs.</p>
