      <p>“We are very encouraged by the progress we made in the past 24 hours in stabilising the platform, and we can confidently say that all critical EcoCash services are now stable and performing normally,” said Mr Eddie Chibi, CEO of Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe (pictured), the parent company of EcoCash.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that popular services such as send money, airtime recharge (for self and for others), banking services, merchant payments (using merchant codes), cashing in and cashing out, customer balance enquiries, payroll, mobile business wallet services, remittances and agents service are now quite stable and working well on our new platform.”</p>
      <p>Mr Chibi said their teams continued to work flat out with experts on the ground to iron out any outstanding issues such as online merchant payments, the EcoCash App and clearing any customer experience issues in the support channels like shops.</p>
