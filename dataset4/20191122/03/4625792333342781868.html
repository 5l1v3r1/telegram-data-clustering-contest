      <h1>'You should vote for Trump': Joe Biden dismisses immigration activist at town hall</h1>

      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden directed a protester at his town hall to vote for President Trump in 2020.</p>
      <p>Biden spoke at a town hall in Greenwood, South Carolina, on Thursday night. Immigration activists with the Cosecha Movement, a group pushing to end deportations of illegal immigrants, attended the event to protest President Barack Obama’s deportation record.</p>
      <p>Activist Carlos Rojas stood up and began criticizing the Obama administration's <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ice-deportations-under-trump-are-up-but-nowhere-near-obama-levels">record</a> on immigration.</p>
      <p>"You should vote for Trump," Biden said.</p>
      <p>"No, I am not going to do that," Rojas said, before calling on Biden to pledge to end all deportations if he is elected president.</p>
      <p>"I will not stop all deportations," Biden said, clarifying that the United States would continue to deport illegal immigrants that commit felonies under his administration.</p>

      <p>Biden is one of the leading Democratic candidates for president in his party’s primary, polling at nearly 30% nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics polling <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">average</a>. The Iowa caucus is months away, scheduled for Feb. 3.</p>
      <p>Under Obama, the U.S. deported between 315,000 and 409,000 people per year from 2008 to 2014, numbers that are significantly higher than the Trump administration. Biden has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3-million-deportations-protesters-heckle-biden-evoking-deportations-under-obama">pledged</a> to decrease the number of deportations relative to the Obama administration levels, should he be elected president.</p>
