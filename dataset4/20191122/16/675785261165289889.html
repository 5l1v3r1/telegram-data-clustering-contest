      <h1>Brexit Party manifesto policies 2019: Summary of policies for general election</h1>
      <h2>Nigel Farage launched the party's "contract with the people" in Westminster today insisting it was not a manifesto but it is filled with all the party's policies. Mr Farage said all the party's demands were underpinned by the need to secure a "clean-break Brexit" with the EU.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:47:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has called for a cap on immigration, a 50% cut in the foreign aid budget and the scrapping of HS2 as he set out the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party's policy platform for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>Launching the party's "contract with the people", Mr Farage said all the party's demands were underpinned by the need to secure a "clean-break Brexit" with the EU.</p>
      <p>While he acknowledged they were not seeking election as the next government, he said they were committing to achieving the Brexit which people voted for in the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>"A clean-break Brexit can shape the future of our economy and society," he said.</p>
      <p>"It will give us the freedom to shape our future by taking immediate control of our own laws, borders, money, fishing and defence."</p>
      <p>The policy document calls for:</p>
      <p>- Scrapping the BBC licence fee</p>
      <p>- Allowing citizens to call referendums if five million people agree</p>
      <p>- Abolishing inheritance tax</p>
      <p>- Investing £2.5 billion in fishing and coastal communities</p>
      <p>- Giving businesses zero-rate corporation tax for the first £10,000 of pre-tax profits</p>
      <p>- Abolishing privatisation in the NHS</p>
      <p>- Establishing 24-hour GP surgeries</p>
      <p>While the Brexit Party is not standing candidates in Conservative-held constituencies, Mr Farage said it was important they took seats to ensure the Tories did not backtrack on their commitments.</p>
      <p>"We need the Brexit Party to hold <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> to his word," he said.</p>
      <p>"We need the Brexit Party voice there in the House of Commons or we're not going to get anything like what we voted for three-and-a-half years ago."</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said their plans could be paid for by £200 billion of savings by cutting the foreign aid budget, ceasing EU payments and scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail link.</p>
      <p>On immigration, he said the UK was facing a "population crisis" as a result of the policies which had been adopted in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>He said the numbers allowed to settle in the country should be capped at "about 50,000" a year and he called for firm action to deter illegal immigrants trying to enter the country.</p>
      <p>"We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels," he said.</p>
      <p>"We think a strong message that says if you come here illegally across the Channel or in the back of a container that you wouldn't be allowed to stay will prevent further human tragedy, and it's the right thing to do."</p>
      <h3>Why isn't it called a manifesto?</h3>

      <p>Nigel Farage says that the word itself has become "tainted" and that people associate it with telling lies.</p>
      <p>Instead he has called his booklet of policies a " <a href="https://www.thebrexitparty.org/contract/">Contract with the People</a> ".</p>
      <p>But it is still full of different policies that the party would want to bring in.</p>
      <p>Asked why he's bothered since the Brexit Party isn't even standing in enough seats to be able to form a government,</p>
      <h3>BREXIT</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The main policy at the top of the document is what the Brexit Party are calling a "clean-break Brexit". It's not entirely clear what that means but it is generally assumed to mean leaving without a deal.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain subsidies and grants paid by the EU to UK businesses such as farmers, fisheries, universities and research bodies: this is our money anyway, recycled by the EU.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Invest £2.5bn in our Fishing and Coastal Communities: with a Clean-Break Brexit we recover control of a 200 mile exclusive economic zone (or the median line), creating the opportunity to regenerate our coastal communities with new investment, jobs and tourism.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TAX</h3>

        <figcaption>(Image: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Cut VAT on domestic fuel: EU rules stop us reducing our VAT rates. We will zero rate VAT on domestic fuel to reduce energy bills — saving an average £65 per household.</li>
        <li>Reduce import tariffs: 20% of UK food items are sourced from outside the EU. A Clean-Break Brexit will allow us to reduce tariffs to zero on certain foods, footwear and clothing.</li>
        <li>Zero rate Corporation Tax for the first £10,000 of pre-tax profits: one million companies – some 66% of the total number – pay less than £10,000. This represents just 6% of Corporation Tax take in 2019; £3.4bn. Total cost £5.1bn per year</li>
        <li>Provide transitional relief to key sectors such as the automotive industry, to ensure a smooth Brexit.</li>
        <li>Create Freeports in certain regions to encourage investment and create new jobs.</li>
        <li>Overhaul financial services regulation, cut red tape, increase competition and boost lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.​</li>
        <li>Abolish Inheritance Tax (IHT).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Constitutional reform</h3>

        <li>Overhaul the postal voting system to combat fraud and abuse.</li>
        <li>Reform the Supreme Court – judges who play a role in politics must be subject to political scrutiny. Ensure political balance by broadening participation in the Selection Commission or conduct interviews by Parliamentary Committee.</li>
        <li>Make the Civil Service sign an oath to act with political neutrality.</li>
        <li>Phase out the BBC licence fee.</li>

      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the UK maintains its commitment to NATO and meets its commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence as an absolute minimum.</li>
        <li>Withdraw from the European Defence Union. This will mean we leave the EU defence procurement directive ensuring the UK has the right to stipulate defence contracts stay at home.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Immigration</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Crack down on illegal immigration and stop the human tragedy associated with human trafficking.</li>
        <li>Reduce annual immigration and address wage stagnation and the skills gap by introducing a fair points system that is blind to ethnic origin. And always provide a humane welcome for genuine refugees.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Crime and Justice</h3>

        <figcaption>(Image: Alamy Stock Photo)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase police numbers — more visible policing, ensure focus on combating violent crime, robbery and burglary rather than enforcing restrictions on free speech.</li>
        <li>Target the menace of County Lines drug dealers, gangs and the growth of knife crime.</li>
        <li>Abolish distortive targets and introduce sentence ‘ranges’ for young offenders, to encourage rehabilitation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>NHS and Social Care</h3>

        <li>Invest in medical research and development and will stop the taxpayer being ripped off by pharmaceutical companies.</li>
        <li>Abolish all politically imposed hospital targets that distort clinical priorities.</li>
        <li>Re-open the nursing and midwifery professions to recruitment without the degree requirement, alongside a new nursing qualification in social care.</li>
        <li>Introduce 24-hour GP surgeries to relieve the strain in A&amp;E departments.</li>
        <li>Have a national debate on our NHS, involving the public alongside MPs, doctors and experts. We should discuss ring-fencing the NHS budget and the tax revenues that pay for it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Education</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Support those who have paid into the system with accelerated payment processes (five-week maximum), and continue to root out fraud.</li>
        <li>Undertake a 12-month review of the system and bring in reforms within two years.</li>
        <li>Review the position of women unexpectedly short-changed by recent rises in the state pension age.</li>
        <li>Extend the use of dormant funds to support civil society.</li>
