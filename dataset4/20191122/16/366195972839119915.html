      <p>It's been a very busy day for Trippie Redd so far. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/trippie-redd-returns-with-a-love-letter-to-you-4-ft-dababy-tory-lanez-juice-wrld-and-more-new-mixtape.119804.html">When the clock struck midnight, the Canton-based rapper released his brand new album <i>A Love Letter To You 4</i>, continuing his ultra-successful series of projects</a>. As expected, the body of work is very enjoyable, spanning twenty-one songs and featuring guests like <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Da-Baby/profile/">DaBaby</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ToryLanez/profile">Tory Lanez</a>, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, and many others. One of the singles to have dropped before the full album is "Who Needs Love," which debuted with a brief visualizer. Deciding to come through with even more content supporting the drop, Trips filmed a video for the cut, premiering it several moments ago.</p>
      <p>Fitting in as the second song on <i>ALLTY4</i>, "Who Needs Love" has the recording artist in his feelings, exclaiming that he doesn't need any love anymore after being broken so many times. The video shows a man who doesn't quite know what he wants. Trippie lays down in bed with two women before getting out from underneath the covers and wailing his lyrics in a Fendi robe. Words are scribbled across his face, perhaps symbolizing the jumbled up emotions in Trippie's mind. Finally, he hits the streets, burns a love note and loses his cool in his room, flipping over mattresses and eventually running out of energy.</p>
