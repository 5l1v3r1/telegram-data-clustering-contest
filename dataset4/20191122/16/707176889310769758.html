      <p>All major political parties should acknowledge the criminal justice system is in “genuine trouble” and merely “throwing more money” at the police will not solve the problem, a former Metropolitan Police commissioner has warned.</p>
      <p>Ian Blair, who was Britain’s most senior officer between 2005 and 2008, also attacked the “rather unthinking bidding war” between the Conservative and Labour parties over how many extra police they would provide in England and Wales.</p>
      <p>Lord Blair’s comments came in a speech on Thursday evening to the Longford Trust, the criminal justice charity, in which he pointed the finger at the austerity cuts pushed through since a Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 for the “tattered” state of the justice system.</p>
      <p>Both main parties have pledged to increase police numbers as part of their election campaign, as a rise in many forms of crime, including serious violence, has fuelled concerns about the impact of government cuts on frontline officers.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have promised an extra <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db3cc14a-afb9-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2">20,000 officers</a> in England and Wales within three years, while Labour has responded that it would boost numbers by 25,000.</p>
      <p>He said it was clear that cuts in youth services — estimated at 61 per cent across England and Wales between 2011 and 2017 — have had a “deleterious effect” on young people’s involvement in crime.</p>
      <p>Far too much police time was being spent on dealing with mental health issues, he added. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/09cf1112-40c4-11e9-9bee-efab61506f44">School exclusions</a> were fuelling the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3427254-b6cb-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe">“county lines” phenomenon</a> of drug-dealing by young people; cutbacks in prison education and probation services were reinforcing reoffending; and it was “probably true” that cuts to schemes such as Sure Start — an early-years education initiative — were failing families with complex needs.</p>
      <p>Lord Blair acknowledged that there was an “obvious need” for “significantly more expenditure” on police officers. But he called for a royal commission or a set of people’s assemblies to decide whether spending on frontline officers was the best way to improve provision.</p>
      <p>“The consensus might come to a conclusion that money might be better spent perhaps on other kinds of employees in the police service . . . or, likely of even more importance, on other services which help to prevent crime in the first place,” he said.</p>
      <p>He called for a “systematic, holistic review of the whole system, concerned with outputs, not inputs, crossing departmental boundaries both inside and outside the criminal justice system”.</p>
      <p>Lord Blair added: “In my view, the system is not yet actually broken but it is so neglected as to be a matter or serious national concern and our citizens need to be engaged in deciding how it should be repaired and improved.”</p>
      <p>The former commissioner <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8540553a-9e62-11e9-9c06-a4640c9feebb">cited</a> the warning by Tom Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary, about the impact of austerity cuts: “You can’t have 100 per cent of whatever it is you want for 60 or 70 per cent of its efficient cost.” </p>
      <p>He concluded: “All major parties need to acknowledge that the criminal justice system is in genuine trouble, which will not be solved by throwing more money only at what is supposed to be the most visible part of it — the police — without a plan.”</p>
      <p>Lord Blair gave the speech after Dame Cressida Dick, current commissioner of the Met, was forced to pull out by election-period restrictions on public officials’ statements. Lord Blair stressed that the speech reflected his views, not hers.</p>
