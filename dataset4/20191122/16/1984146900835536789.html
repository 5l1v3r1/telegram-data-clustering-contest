      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Holland</a></address>
      <p>Top Labour figures on Tyneside have refused to criticise Jeremy Corbyn, after he appeared to side with the Tees Valley’s Tory mayor in a bitter row over new Metro trains.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour Party</a> leader told ChronicleLive on Thursday that the new Tyne and Wear rail fleet must be built in the UK and should be made at Hitachi’s Newton Aycliffe factory.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn’s comments echoed the views of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservative</a> mayor Ben Houchen, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/metro-hitachi-houchen-500m-contract-16946331">who has called for the procurement of the new trains to be paused</a> and accused Tyne and Wear councils of being “unwilling or unable to give North East workers at Hitachi Rail a fair shot”.</p>
      <p>Reports emerged in September that the firm would miss out on the £500m contract in favour of either Spanish firm CAF or Swiss manufacturer Stadler.</p>

      <p>Labour leaders in Newcastle and Gateshead slammed Mr Houchen’s demands at the time,<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/new-metro-fleet-brexit-warning-17101207"> saying he risked losing millions of pounds in taxpayer money and delaying the much-needed replacement of Metro’s increasingly unreliable trains.</a></p>
      <p>Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon called last month for the Tees Valley mayor to “stop playing politics and get behind the most important transport investment in this region for a generation”.</p>
      <p>But in response to Mr Corbyn’s calls for the new trains to be built locally, Coun Gannon said: “We are currently, in Tyne and Wear, operating under the legal framework we have at the moment.</p>
      <p>“We are following precisely the procurement legislation, openly and transparently.</p>
      <p>“We look forward with interest to discussions with Government, whoever that will be after December 12.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council</a> leader Nick Forbes declined to comment on Mr Corbyn’s remarks.</p>
      <p>But in October, Coun Forbes said: “We fought for years to secure investment in the Metro. What Ben Houchen is proposing is restart that work, to leave Tyne and Wear citizens<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/metro-trains-worst-in-world-17219872"> dependent upon an ageing fleet</a> while at the same time adding millions to our costs and opening the threat of legal action.”</p>
      <p>It is understood that restarting the procurement process would cost Nexus, the public body which owns and manages the Tyne Wear Metro, an estimated £20m.</p>
      <p>Mr Houchen tweeted that it was a “strange feeling” to have the Labour leader agree with him on Hitachi.</p>

      <p>He added: “Think he should have a word with the Labour run Tyne and Wear councils who have excluded Hitachi from the process. An amazing North East business and the only UK bidder.”</p>
      <p>Nexus is expected to announce the winning bidder in January.</p>
      <p>The new trains are expected to arrive from 2022 and boast features such as air conditioning, Tube-style linear seating to increase capacity, and wifi.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn told ChronicleLive: "In the case of major infrastructure projects or anything related to security, you can require that it's built in this country and we would absolutely do that.</p>
      <p>"It is odd to put it mildly - Tyne and Wear Metro does need new trains, anyone who's been on the Tyne and Wear Metro will know that.</p>
      <p>"You have an Hitachi factory just down the road that can make them, they should be making it, and not so far away you have have Bombardier in Derby and you have have Talgo opening a factory in Scotland.</p>
      <p>"And so to say there’s not the train manufacturing capacity in the UK is simply not true. So yes of course they’ve got to be manufactured in this country."</p>
