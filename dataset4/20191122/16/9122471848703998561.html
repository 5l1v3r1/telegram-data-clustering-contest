      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:58:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>A pair of SEC powerhouses square off this weekend as the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">No. 4 Georgia Bulldogs</a> take on the Texas A&amp;M Aggies at Sanford Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Bulldogs secured their spot in the SEC Championship Game last week, but still need to win out in order to get into the College Football Playoff. Outside of one stumble against South Carolina, they’ve largely dominated teams thanks to a No. 2 ranked defense that allows less than 11 points per game.</p>
      <p>The Aggies, on the other hand, are 0-3 against ranked opponents this year, losing to Clemson, Alabama and Auburn. But they’ve beaten all of their other opponents – including South Carolina – thanks to an offense scoring 34 points per game.</p>
      <p>The difference in defenses between the two is going to be the real indicator in this game. Bettors have Georgia favored by double-digits – almost exactly the difference between the number of points per game the two teams have allowed.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for the Texas A&amp;M vs. Georgia game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time:</b> 3:30 PM ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel:</b> CBS</p>
      <p><b>Spread:</b> <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/texas-am-aggies-georgia-bulldogs-201911230068/">Georgia -13</a></p>
      <p><b>Over/Under:</b> 44</p>
      <p><b>Announcers:</b> Brad Nessler, Gary Danielson, Jamie Erdahl</p>
      <p>The two teams have only played each other five previous times in their history. Texas A&amp;M won three games in the 1950s before Georgia got their first win in 1980. Amazingly, this will be the first matchup between the two teams as SEC conference foes.</p>
      <p>The last time the two faced off was in the 2009 Independence Bowl. Georgia won that game 44-20. You can bet that Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs will want this game to go a lot like that one.</p>
