        <b>Aldi has been crowned Ireland’s most recommended retailer by consumers across the country, a new survey from market-research firm YouGov has shown.</b>
      </p>
      <p>YouGov’s 2019 Advocacy Rankings screened 70 brands to calculate their net recommendation scores for the period of November 2018-October 2019. Responders, who had to be either current or former customers of the given brand, were asked "Would you recommend the brand to a friend or colleague?" and “Would you tell a friend or colleague to avoid the brand?”.</p>
      <p>Aldi’s score surpassed all other retailers in Ireland, taking second position across all brands after streaming giant Netflix.</p>

      <p>This is the second time YouGov has released the Advocacy rankings, however the firm only began tracking retail brands in September 2018, making Aldi’s ascendance all the more impressive.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year, Aldi was also named Ireland’s top brand, surpassing major competitors in such metrics as Reputation and Value in YouGov’s BrandIndex ranking.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the success, Aldi group buying director John Curtin said: “We are delighted to receive this honour from YouGov, as voted by our loyal customers. We are constantly striving to offer customers the highest quality Irish products at market leading prices. Clearly this mission is succeeding, with so many people happy to endorse our business and recommend us to a friend or family member. We look forward to continuing to serve our loyal customers and offering them the best products and services in Irish retail.”</p>
