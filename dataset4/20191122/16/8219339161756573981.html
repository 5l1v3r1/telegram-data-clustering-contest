      <h1>Apple expands App Store Connect server-to-server notifications for developers [Update]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:20:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Apple has updated its server-to-server notifications today with the ability for developers to get alerts when a renewal fails or when a billing issue is resolved.</p>
      <p>Apple noted that developers who already have server-to-server notifications set up in App Store Connect will get the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11222019a&amp;1574438522">new notifications automatically</a>. There is also a new unified receipt.</p>
      <blockquote>Server-to-server notifications from the App Store let you receive real-time updates in a subscription’s status, so you can provide customized experiences for your subscribers. New notifications are now available when a subscription renewal fails due to a billing issue and when a billing issue is resolved by the App Store. In addition, a unified receipt containing information about the latest 100 in-app purchase transactions is now included with the notification. If you’ve already enabled server-to-server notifications in App Store Connect, you’ll automatically receive the new notifications and unified receipt for these subscription events.</blockquote>
      <p>If you’re not set up with these already, check out Apple’s support page here on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/">signing up for server-to-server notifications</a>.</p>
      <p><i><b>Update: </b></i>It appears along with today’s update, existing server-to-server notification implementations may have been broken for some developers.</p>
