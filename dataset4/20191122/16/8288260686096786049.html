      <p>Shreya’s career consequently took off and she has now featured in some of the most iconic Bollywood films of all time.</p>
      <p>Yet her achievements are far from exclusively filmic as her performance of the song “Jaadu Hai Nasha Hai” shot up the charts and into the mainstream music scene.</p>
      <p>She has also become notorious for her incredible live shows, having performed in America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK which she visited in 2013 to celebrate Bollywood's 100th birthday.</p>
      <p>Now she will return to the UK for only two dates for an exclusive set of shows for the ages.</p>
