      <p>The Dutch Seniors Christmas Lunch is being held this year at the Canberra Club in Barton on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>Oranjefeest Canberra. a not-for-profit community organisation sponsors the event each year, organising entertainment and volunteers to serve and transport the participants. There will be magic and Dutch piano tunes and a Dutch toast or three.</p>
      <p>One of the organisers, Hans van der Zandt, says people who'd like to go to the lunch have until Tuesday to book.</p>
      <p>"We would like to reach out to as many Dutch seniors as possible to give them a good time," he said.</p>
      <p>"The old Dutchies helped to build Canberra 50 years or so ago."</p>
      <p>Among the Dutch who did help Canberra to grow were Elly and Harry Janssen who moved from Holland direct to the national capital in 1968.</p>
      <p>Harry was a carpenter and his skills were in high demand. He started on cottages and then hung fire doors for Wormald in countless buildings, ending with his last job, at new Parliament House.</p>
      <p>"You name the building and I've been in it. I don't want to know about doors now. I've started dreaming about doors now," Harry said, with a laugh.</p>
      <p>He and Elly went on to have three children in Canberra.</p>
      <p>"I had no intention of coming to Canberra but Elly had an uncle here," Harry said. "I'm still getting used to the place."</p>
      <p>Elly who also worked in hospitality, remembered well arriving in their new home city 51 years ago.</p>
      <p>"It was good. Nice and roomy - open - compared to what we'd left behind," she said.</p>
      <p>The Janssens having been attending the Dutch Christmas lunch for about 10 years.</p>
      <p>"You get together for a nice feed and catch up with people you sort of haven't seen the whole year," she said.</p>
      <p>People who'd like to attend the lunch can ring Hans van der Zandt on 0419 405 273.</p>
