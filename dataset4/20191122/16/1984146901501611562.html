      <h1>Steve Bruce opens up on 'lack of information' at Newcastle United which Steve Harper can now help resolve</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle United's new first team coach Steve Harper will work at both the Under-23 and</h2>

      <p>Steve Bruce insisted a fortnight ago he wanted to have an input into what came next at Newcastle United's Academy following the exit of Neil Redfearn.</p>
      <p>The Under-23 coach quit his post after just a few months in the job this month but Bruce has worked with the club's hierarchy to come up with a plan that should help create what he sees as "a bridge" between the club's younger sides and the first team.</p>
      <p>In former goalkeeper Steve Harper - handed the title of first team coach - the long-serving ex-Toon star will work between Little Benton and the club's senior training base.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-chiefs-looking-tweak-17229542">As reported on Chronicle Live on November 10</a> , Bruce was eager to make some tweaks to the set-up at Newcastle after getting a good feel for the club since being appointed in July.</p>
      <p>Harper had been spotted at the last Under-23 game in deep conversation with Bruce during 1-0 loss against West Brom in the Premier League Cup defeat at Whitley Park.</p>
      <p>After announcing the change, Bruce said: "Since I came through the door I have always taken a great pleasure in seeing what our Academy is producing.</p>
      <p>"With the difficulty of being on two sites it is vitally important we have a link between the two.</p>
      <p>"And certainly Steve Harper will give us that link.</p>
      <p>"He is somebody who I had the pleasure of managing when I took him to Hull for a couple of years.</p>
      <p>"He's went on to do his coaching badges and he is one of the young brigade."</p>
      <p>When asked to describe Harper's new role, Bruce, speaking to NUFC's TV channel, said: "He will come in and do a little bit of coaching, not just goalkeeping.</p>
      <p>"More importantly it gives us this bridge between the first team and the Academy because it's important I have enough information.</p>
      <p>"At the minute I just think we are lacking in that department.</p>
      <p>"We welcome Steve aboard and I am sure he will do a great job.</p>
      <p>"He's Newcastle through and through and it is the start of a new career for him.</p>
      <p>"I hope this can be a platform for him to do bigger and better things."</p>
      <p>A club statement summed up Harper's new position and read: "Steve will work alongside first team coaches Steve Agnew and Stephen Clemence and head of goalkeeping Simon Smith as a key part of Steve Bruce's backroom team.</p>
      <p>"Part of Harper's role will be to work with Academy staff as the club looks to forge closer links between the first team and its Academy set-up, building on a pathway that has seen the likes of Sean and Matty Longstaff make their Premier League debuts over the past 18 months."</p>
      <p>Harper is also set to stay on as part of Northern Ireland's backroom team and will combine his roles.</p>
