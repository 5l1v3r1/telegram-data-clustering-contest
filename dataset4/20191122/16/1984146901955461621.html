      <h1>Nexus on hunt for 'urgent funding' to build new Shields Ferry landing at North Shields Fish Quay</h1>
      <h2>The ferry is currently suspended because of storm damage to its existing jetty on the north side of the Tyne</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Holland</a></address>
      <p>The Shields Ferry’s north landing could soon be relocated to a new site with “enormous potential” to attract more passengers.</p>
      <p>Transport bosses have revealed that they are looking to drum up the cash to move the landing to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-shields">North Shields</a> Fish Quay.</p>
      <p>The ferry is currently <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/shields-ferry-suspended-urgent-repairs-17238934">out of action for up to a month</a> because of storm damage to its existing New Quay jetty earlier this month.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nexus">Nexus</a>, which operates the Ferry as well as Metro trains, is taking the opportunity to try and push ahead with one of its key ambitions for the future of the service by moving it to the Western Quay at the North Shields Fish Quay.</p>

      <p>Helen Mathews, Nexus’ head of business development, told councillors on Thursday that the organisation was seeking “urgent funding” for the relocation.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the move would encourage more people to use the ferry to access the Fish Quay’s market, restaurants and pubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside</a> councillor Carl Johnson said that the Western Quay had always been his preferred site for a ferry landing and that a relocation would boost the council’s plans to redevelop North Shields as a culture and leisure destination.</p>
      <p>At a meeting of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/metro-ticket-rise-2020-approved-17296139">North East Joint Transport Committee’s Tyne and Wear sub-committee on Thursday</a> , Coun Johnson added that it would be “silly” for Nexus to consider cutting late night ferry services at weekends if the relocation goes ahead.</p>
      <p>Nexus customer services director Huw Lewis said that the Fish Quay has “enormous potential as a way to grow ferry patronage”, and offered the opportunity to expand the ferry’s operating hours rather than cut back.</p>
      <p>The prospect of a similar ferry service across the River Wear in Sunderland was also discussed, with potential jetties at Sunderland University on the north bank of the river and at Panns Bank on the south side.</p>
      <p>Ms Mathews said that Nexus had looked at the idea on “a number of occasions”, but that the project would be too difficult to pursue.</p>
      <p>She added: “The two key barriers are the dredging of the river and the significant tidal levels which would make it very difficult to put landings in.</p>
      <p>“The extent to which they would have to protrude out into the river meant that they were so close together that the ferry had a short crossing area.</p>
      <p>“We concluded that it was not the best solution to create those links.”</p>
      <p>A Nexus report states that it is “doubtful that the demand would be sufficient to justify further consideration of this option at the present time”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland </a>councillor Amy Wilson said it was the job of regional transport leaders to find a way around those difficulties.</p>
