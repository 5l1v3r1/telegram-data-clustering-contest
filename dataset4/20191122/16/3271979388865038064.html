      <p><b>Scarlett Johansson</b> hasn’t forced <b>Colin Jost</b> to leave <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, but one year ago today, a tabloid wrongly reported that would be the case. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the story when it was published this time last year. Time has proven it false.</p>
      <p>On November 22, 2018, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted <i><b>Star</b></i> for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/scarlett-johansson-colin-jost-quit-saturday-night-live-snl/">Johansson was making Jost quit <i>SNL</i> to focus more on their relationship</a>. According to the magazine, the actress gave the comedian an ultimatum to give up his career so he could travel with her while she’s on location shooting movies. An alleged source told the outlet that Jost was willing to give up his gig as the sketch show’s head writer and <i>Weekend Update</i> anchor because “as much as he loves <i>SNL</i>, he loves her more.”</p>
      <p>As <b>Gossip Cop</b> noted last year, the premise didn’t make much sense. Johansson lives with Jost in New York City, where <i>SNL</i> is taped. The actress only had one film lined up at the time, a standalone movie centered around her <i>Avengers</i> character Black Widow. The Marvel movie ended up filming from late May until early October of this year. Jost happened to be off work during the majority of that stretch as <i>SNL</i> was on hiatus. Regardless, Johansson never issued any sort of ultimatum for him to quit his job, as a source close to actress assured us last year.</p>
      <p>In the time since we corrected the phony story, Johansson and Jost got engaged and the comedian is still on <i>SNL</i>. In fact, the actress has accompanied her fiancé to many of the show’s afterparties. Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/jennifer-lopez-scarlett-johansson-saturday-night-live-eddie-murphy-host-december-1202791111/">Johansson will be hosting <i>SNL</i> in December</a>. Far from forcing Jost to quit the sketch show, she’ll be appearing on it with him.</p>
      <p>Of course, we’re not at all surprised that the tabloid was so off-base. Just <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/scarlett-johansson-colin-jost-split-engagement/">days before Johansson and Jost announced their engagement</a> this past May, the outlet insisted they were “calling it quits.” That bogus article even suggested the actress was cheating on him, but the fake narrative was as poorly-timed as it gets. Instead of splitting, the newly-engaged couple is headed down the aisle.</p>
      <p>In August, <i>Star</i> ignored it’s previous breakup story and pretended to know the details of the couple’s upcoming wedding. The tabloid insisted <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/scarlett-johansson-colin-jost-wedding-hotel-rooftop-new-york/">Johansson and Jost were getting married on a hotel rooftop</a> in New York City in the fall. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the made-up report, and as we approach the end of the year, the couple doesn’t appear to have a ceremony in the works just yet. It’s safe to say the publication knows nothing about the couple’s relationship.</p>
