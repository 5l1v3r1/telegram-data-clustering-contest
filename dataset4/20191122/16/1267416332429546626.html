      <h1>Uber to record rider/driver audio in safety test in some parts of the world</h1>
      <h2>This feature doesn't seem to be coming to Canada yet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:18:06+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>In a new test to make sure that drivers and riders are more accountable, the Uber app may start recording audio of some rides in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
      <p>According to documents obtained by the <i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/20/uber-plans-start-audio-recording-rides-us-safety/">Washington Post</a>, </i>users in the two countries will begin to get notifications and emails letting them know that Uber is recording their ride.</p>
      <p>To enable the feature, users need to opt-in through the app’s safety toolkit. Then at the end of a trip, riders will be asked how the ride went. If it didn’t go super smoothly then users can send the audio to Uber as proof.</p>
      <p>Uber told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2019/11/21/uber-will-test-a-new-safety-feature-recording-audio-during-rides/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2852989250&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesTechTwitter#55d98af75ac3"><i>Forbes</i></a><i> </i>that all recordings are encrypted and stay with the riders and drivers until they decide to submit them to the ride-share company.</p>
      <p>While riders and drivers can both trigger recording, the app won’t notify the other party if one person starts a recording. This is to make sure that an already sketchy situation doesn’t escalate.</p>
      <p>Uber has had issues in the past with drivers and riders who don’t listen to the rules and now it’s trying a new way to keep people in check.</p>
      <p>Uber Canada says that this test is only happening in some parts of Latin America and there are no expansion plans as of yet.</p>
