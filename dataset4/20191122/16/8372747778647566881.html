      <p>AUBURN HILLS, Mich. – Fiat Chrysler is recalling an estimated 528,594 SUVs in the U.S. because of a problem that can cause engines to stall.</p>

      <p>Affected customers will be advised when they may schedule service, which will be provided free of charge. Those with questions or concerns can call 1-800-853-1403.</p>
