        <li>Renders of <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/newsroom_affiliate_samsung-galaxy/https://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung’s</a> upcoming <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/galaxy-s11">Galaxy S11</a> from gadgets-leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer and 91 Mobiles likely reveal what the device will look like.</li>
        <li>Hemmerstoffer and 91 Mobiles nailed the renders for the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/newsroom_affiliate_samsung-galaxy/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/">Galaxy S10</a> before it was released.</li>
        <li>The Galaxy S11 could have reduced curved edges compared to the Galaxy S10, and the punch-hole selfie camera may find itself in the top center of the screen. The camera module looks different to what Samsung has done in the past as well.</li>

      <p>When gadgets-leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer releases a render of an unannounced and unreleased device, it’s typically pretty spot-on.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Hemmerstoffer and 91 Mobiles’ <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-5k-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/">renders for the Galaxy S10</a> nailed every perceivable detail about the exterior design.</p>
      <p>So when Hemmerstoffer released a render of Samsung’s unannounced Galaxy S11 in partnership with tech site <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s11-render-design-exclusive">91Mobiles</a>, it’s likely to be our very first and mostly accurate look at the device.</p>

      <h3>If accurate, the renders show a familiar Samsung Galaxy S10-style design on the front, but the camera module looks completely different to what Samsung has done in the past.</h3>

      <h3>It’s suggested that the punch-hole selfie camera will move from the top right of the screen, like on the Galaxy S10, to the center on the Galaxy S11. The bezels look incredibly thin in the Galaxy S11’s render, too.</h3>

      <p>The Galaxy S11’s screen will measure in between 6.3 and 6.7 inches, according to 91 Mobiles, and the screen’s edges will be less curved than previous Galaxy S devices.</p>

      <h3>Here’s the Galaxy S10 Plus for reference, with the punch hole camera on the top right, and a thicker top bezel than the Galaxy S11’s render.</h3>

      <h3>The Galaxy S11’s camera module may be found on the top left corner, whereas most Samsung phones have a camera strip along the center in the top half of the back.</h3>

      <p>The most prolific rumor about the camera on Samsung’s Galaxy S11 is that one of the camera lenses will have a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-108-megapixels-rumored-2019-11">108-megapixel sensor</a>. Otherwise, we’d expect to see similar camera options like a zoomed lens and an ultra-wide lens.</p>

      <h3>Here’s the back on the Galaxy 10 phone series, which shows Samsung’s more traditional horizontal camera strip design.</h3>
