      <p>There’s no stopping <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/virat-kohli">Virat Kohli</a> and breaking records. The <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/india">Indian</a> captain registered yet another record on Friday during India’s maiden <a href="https://www.india.com/sports/pink-ball-test-india-vs-bangladesh-2019-virat-kohli-rock-solid-as-india-dominate-day-1-3853642/">Pink Ball Test</a> – the second Test against <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> – as he became the fastest to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket as captain and only the sixth overall to achieve the feat.</p>
      <p>Kohli, who was rested for the T20I series, required 32 runs to achieve the milestone before the start of the two-Test series. He put behind the record previously held by former Australia captain <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/ricky-ponting">Ricky Ponting</a>, who took 54 matches (97 innings) to set the record. Kohli reached the feat in his 53rd match (86th innings) as India captain.</p>

      <p>If Kohli, who has become the only Indian to breach the 5000-run mark as captain, does manage to register a century at Eden Gardens, he will overtake Ponting to occupy the second position in the list of captains with most hundreds in the longest format.</p>
      <p>Kohli and Ponting are currently tied on 19 centuries as skipper on the list which is headed by Graeme Smith, who had hit 25 tons as South Africa captain.</p>
      <p>Kohli remained unbeaten on 59 off 93 with his deputy Ajinkya Rahane giving him company on 23 off 22 as India reached 174/3, ahead by 68 runs, at stumps on the opening day.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ishant Sharma (5/22) claimed five wickets, Umesh Yadav (3/29) snapped three while Mohammed Shami (2/36) took two as the hosts bundled out Bangladesh for 106 after Mominul Haque won the toss and opted to bat.</p>
