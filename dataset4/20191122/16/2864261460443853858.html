      <h1>Manitoba slams lack of detail on feds’ Indigenous child-welfare overhaul plan</h1>
      <h2>The federal government has said the legislation will reduce the number of Indigenous children in care</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:10:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bashawstar.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Canada is only six weeks away from one of the largest-ever reforms to the Indigenous child-welfare system and Ottawa has not shared information about how it will be implemented or funded, Manitoba’s families minister says.</p>
      <p>“This is not the way to bring about reforms in such an important area as this that will have an impact on the most vulnerable people in our society — which is our children,” Heather Stefanson said. “This is unacceptable.”</p>
      <p>Stefanson said she shared her concerns with former Indigenous Services minister Seamus O’Regan last month about the rollout of C-92, which is to include a massive overhaul of Indigenous child-welfare across the country.</p>
      <p>She said she never received a response.</p>
      <p>Stefanson said she has sent another letter to newly appointed Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller this week reasserting the province’s concerns.</p>
      <p>The federal government has said the legislation will reduce the number of Indigenous children in care by affirming the inherent rights of First Nation, Inuit and Metis communities.</p>
      <p>Indigenous groups — which is not defined in the legislation — are to give notice of their intent to exercise jurisdiction or request a tripartite co-ordination agreement with the federal and provincial government. They would develop or implement existing laws related to child welfare and those would prevail over federal and provincial laws.</p>
      <p>There is no funding attached to the legislation.</p>

      <p>Rola Tfaili, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said the department can’t provide specific information until the new year. Tfaili said the implementation will be co-developed with Indigenous partners and stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Stefanson said she supports the overall objective of the legislation but said there’s no clear plans for how it will be implemented or funded.</p>
      <p>In Manitoba, the stakes are high, she added. There are about 10,000 children in care in the province and about 90 per cent are Indigenous.</p>
      <p>“We want to ensure these kids don’t fall through the cracks as a result of these changes that are being imposed by the federal government,” she said.</p>
      <p>There are more than 60 First Nations in Manitoba. While many people live on reserves, a significant number live in urban centres.</p>
      <p>There is also a large Metis population. Stefanson said the legislation needs to address situations where kids have connections to multiple communities.</p>
      <p>She is concerned how it will affect data-sharing between agencies, such as the child-abuse registry, and ensure equity in care and work within the provincial court system.</p>
      <p>Manitoba is currently doing its own child-welfare overhaul, and it will likely affect those plans, she said.</p>
      <p>“This is arguably the biggest reform of child welfare in the history of our country and there’s been no dialogue.”</p>
      <p>Stefanson said there are also questions about how it will affect the jurisdiction of the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth.</p>
      <p>Advocate Daphne Penrose said there must be a clear plan on how to move from the current system to the new laws. She has not received any communication from the federal government.</p>
      <p>“This is a system where children’s lives depend on this system protecting them in a number of areas, and supporting families to stay together,” she said, adding that people need to work together to make it a success.</p>
      <p>“The federal government needs to provide communication and resources and funding and transitional frameworks in order for this to be done in a meaningful and good way for kids. Those commitments need to be in place.”</p>
