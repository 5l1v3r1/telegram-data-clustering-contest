      <p>TMZ published a video from Dame Dash's recent deposition with an attorney that was asking him questions about a lawsuit against him over the movie, <i>Dear Frank</i>. Dame is being sued by the director of the film, who claims that Dame, who was initially hired to direct, marketed and distributed the film under a different name, causing confusion with consumers. </p>
      <p>Dame is agitated from the beginning of the video, and he calls the plaintiffs’ attorney, Christopher Brown, a "culture vulture." Dame continues on about how angry he is at Brown, a Black man, telling him, "I want people to know how disgusted I am. I’m human bro. I get people like this trying to rob me every day with a straight face. And they don’t care about the culture they only care about themselves," adding, "He'll sell his whole culture out for a dollar."</p>
