      </p>
      <p>The Moon is in beauty and pleasure seeking Libra today, putting us in the mood for art, beauty, and anything that brings some light and carefree energy to our day.</p>
      <p>The light and carefree vibes will be a theme for next few weeks as the Sun leaves the deep and churning waters of Scorpio for the warm, bouncy energy of Sagittarius at mid-morning. Though love planet Venus and buoyant Jupiter have been in happy-go-lucky Sagittarius for some time, Sagittarius season finally kicks off, encouraging us to express ourselves through laughter, learning, and adventure.</p>
      <p>With the Moon in Libra and the Sun in Sagittarius, we're called to connect with folks of different cultures and backgrounds and pursue activities that help to enrich our relationships and quality of life.</p>
      <p>Read below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/your-november-2019-monthly-horoscope-17894181">November 2019 monthly horoscope</a>.</p>
