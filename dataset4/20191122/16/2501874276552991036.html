      <p>A paraglider suffered critical injuries following a crash in the backcountry of Santa Ynez on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>At 1:45 p.m., the Santa Barbara County Department (SBCFD) received a call from Paradise Road of paraglider down but the coordinates were actually in the area of Cachuma Saddle. Fire engines and Helicopter 308 responded to the area east of Goat Rock in the back county.</p>
      <p>The helicopter was able to locate the paraglider, a 42-year-old male. A paramedic was lowered from the helicopter and determined the paraglider was suffering from critical injuries. He was packaged and hoisted back up to the helicopter and was then flown to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for further treatment.Â </p>
      <p>Any updates on this incident will be added to this article.</p>
