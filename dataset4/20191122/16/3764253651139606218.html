      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Giannina who is the daughter of Argentina football legend Diego Maradona<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1273101-diego-maradona-giannina-claims-father-killed-inside.html"> raised a serious concern over her father's health</a> status after claiming that he is ''dying from the inside''.</p>
