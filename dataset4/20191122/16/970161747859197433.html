      <p>The much anticipated new season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-grand-tour/">The Grand Tour</a> starring <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-clarkson/">Jeremy Clarkson</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-may/">James May</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/richard-hammond/">Richard Hammond</a> is coming to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a> Prime Video next month and the release date for the fourth season has just been confirmed.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/grand-tour-season-4-fans-fuming-episode-count-10883804/">viewers were disappointed</a> last month when they thought the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/how-many-episodes-does-the-grand-tour-season-4-have-10890657/">fourth season of The Grand Tour would consist of just two episodes</a>, people will no doubt be excited to hear that the show will be landing on Amazon Prime sooner than expected and there are more specials to come.</p>
      <p>Executive producer Andy Wilman confirmed in October that the first special of the new season, which will be 90 minutes in length, would drop around Christmas time, with the second in the spring – but fans will get to see the first episode much sooner than that.</p>
      <h3>When is the release date for The Grand Tour season 4?</h3>

      <p>The Grand Tour season 4 will be dropping on Amazon Prime Video on Friday 13 December 2019.</p>
      <p>Described as a: ‘feature-length epic road trip’ the first episode of the new season will see Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond adventure across waters in Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
      <p>The episode is called The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen and in their announcement of the new season’s release date Amazon Prime say: ‘For one time only, the presenters have taken a break from four wheels and instead undertaken an ambitious journey in boats. Their adventure-packed voyage takes them along one of the world’s most iconic waterways – the Mekong Delta.</p>
      <p>‘Fans can expect elements of their previous classic road trips, with the trio choosing their boats in the usual way they choose their cars, with their own off-the-wall rationale, putting their own spin on their individual vessels… as well as each other’s.’</p>
      <p>Amazon Prime have also confirmed that the second episode of the fourth season, again another feature-length special, has just <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/grand-tour-hosts-jeremy-clarkson-richard-hammond-james-may-back-together-season-4-travels-11034992/">wrapped filming</a> in Madagascar.</p>
