        <b>LOS ANGELES, United States, Nov 22 – Floyd Mayweather has teased a possible return to fighting, writing in an Instagram post he was “coming out of retirement” in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former welterweight boxing king revealed news of the comeback beneath a photo of him wearing boxing trunks and hand wraps.</p>
      <p>“Coming out of retirement in 2020,” Mayweather wrote in the Instagram post late Thursday, giving no additional information.</p>
      <p>In a separate post late Thursday, Mayweather wrote he was working with UFC tycoon Dana White on a event for next year.</p>
      <p>“@danawhite and I working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020,” wrote Mayweather. No further details was provided.</p>
      <p>Mayweather collaborated with White for his last competitive boxing bout in August 2017, when the American scored a knockout of Irish mixed martial arts superstar Conor McGregor in a money-spinning superfight in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old had walked away from traditional boxing two years earlier after a win over Andre Berto that saw him hang up his gloves with an undefeated 49-0 record.</p>
      <p>In December last year, Mayweather fought Japanese MMA star Tenshin Nasukawa in a widely ridiculed three-round exhibition fight, winning in the first round.</p>
