      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/11/22/dwayne-johnson-confirms-black-adam-will-introduce-justice-society-of-America/">Comic Book</a>,<b>Black Adam</b> star <a href="https://www.comingsoon.net/tag/dwayne-johnson">Dwayne Johnson</a> has confirmed a new detail about his highly-anticipated DC movie, revealing that the classic DC superhero team Justice Society of America will finally be making its’ DCEU debut in the upcoming anti-hero film. During the interview, <b>Jumanji: The Next Level</b> co-star and frequent collaborator Kevin Hart had also asked if he can be Black Adam’s sidekick, and Johnson teased him that he can instead have a role in JSA because his character doesn’t have a sidekick.</p>
      <p><b><i> “We’re also gonna introduce JSA in Black Adam,” </i></b>Johnson said to Hart<b><i>. “So in JSA maybe there’s a (role)…They have an animal, a pet.”</i></b></p>
      <p>In the comics, Black Adam had both been an enemy and an ally to the JSA. First appearing in 1941, the Justice Society of America is known as the first ever team of superheroes to be formed in comic book history. They were created by Sheldon Mayer and Gardner Fox during the Golden Age of Comic Books. The team’s original members include Doctor Fate, Hour-Man, Spectre, Sandman, Atom, The Flash, Green Lantern and Hawkman.</p>

      <p>Dwayne Johnson has been working on <a href="https://www.comingsoon.net/tag/black-adam"><b>Black Adam</b></a> for 10 years. The character was originally supposed to appear in this year’s <b>Shazam!</b> but decided to save his highly-anticipated debut for a later film in order to let each character get some breathing room.
