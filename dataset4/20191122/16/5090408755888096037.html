          <b>Every <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-american-express-cards">American Express card</a> features a program called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-amex-offers-work">Amex Offers</a>, which gives huge discounts or bonus rewards points when you use your card for purchases at certain retailers, restaurants, or services.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>If you have cards like the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-platinum-card-from-american-express/?utm_campaign=bi_amex_offers_2&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Platinum Card® from American Express</a> or the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-american-express-gold-card/?utm_campaign=bi_amex_offers_2&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">American Express® Gold Card</a>, you can save hundreds of dollars each year, or earn thousands of extra points.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Offers are specifically targeted to each person, and even each different card that person has. That means that having a few Amex cards means you’ll likely get access to a wider range of offers.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Take a look below at a small sample of the offers currently available across Amex cards.</b>

      <p>While plenty of well-known perks are attached to various Amex cards – the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/american-express-platinum-credit-card-review">Amex Platinum Card</a> gets you access to more than 1,200 airport lounges around the world, for instance – there are also a lot of lesser-known benefits.</p>
      <p>One of those benefits that’s available through virtually every Amex card, but isn’t the most widely known, is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-amex-offers-work">Amex Offers</a>.</p>
      <h3>What are Amex Offers?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-amex-offers-work">Amex Offers program</a> provides cardholders with discounts at various stores, restaurants, or services, or, if not a discount, then chances to earn extra points.</p>
      <p>The interesting part of the program is that each offer is specifically targeted to individual users and each user’s individual cards. That means that you and I might get different offers, and I might even see different offers across my several different Amex cards. That adds a real benefit to having multiple Amex cards – even if you just use them to be eligible for more offers, you have a better chance of getting good ones.</p>
      <p>One of the appeals of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-amex-offers-work">Amex Offers program</a> is that the offers continuously change. Offers can be for national brands, but are also targeted based on your billing address – for example, I have a few offers for shops and restaurants that have a New York City location.</p>
      <h3>Current Amex Offers</h3>
      <p>Here are some of the particularly interesting Amex Offers currently available. Keep in mind that some of may no longer be available, and some are specifically targeted.</p>
