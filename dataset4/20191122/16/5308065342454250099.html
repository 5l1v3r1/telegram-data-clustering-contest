      <p>Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun, the two executives refused the use of older music or performance footage for a documentary by Netflix on Swift’s life.</p>
      <p>According to Swift the message sent to her was very clear which is to be a good little girl and shut up or she’ll be punished.</p>
      <p>Borchetta and Braun were not available for comments.</p>
      <p>This year Braun acquired Big Machine Label Group, a Nashville-based record company founded by Borchetta that owns the master recordings of Swift’s past songs.</p>
      <p>Braun also represents Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber among others.</p>
      <p>At 15, Swift signed with Big Machine but she left last November for Universal Music Group, a unit of French conglomerate Vivendi, and released her first album with UMG in August.</p>
      <p>For Swift, she said that her performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events she is planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark.</p>
      <p>Her latest album, Lover broke records in China as it was part of the opening gala for the Nov. 11 Singles’ Day online shopping festival of retail juggernaut Alibaba, which pulled in a record US$38.4 billion.</p>
