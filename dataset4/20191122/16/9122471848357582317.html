      <h1>NFL Insider Reveals What He’s Hearing About Tua Tagovailoa’s Draft Decision</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:30:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury.</p>
      <p>As he attempted to escape two Mississippi State defenders, Tua fell awkwardly and dislocated his hip – suffering a fracture in the hip as well. Initial reports suggested his football career could be in jeopardy.</p>
      <p>However, his doctors released a statement saying he’s expected to fully recover from surgery to repair the injury.</p>
      <p>The injury cast doubt on Tua’s NFL future, but several draft analysts still expect him to be a first-round pick.</p>
      <p>If he leaves, that is. One ESPN analyst suggested Tagovailoa should return to Alabama to improve his draft stock for the 2021 NFL draft.</p>
      <p>So what will he do? <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/tua-tagovailoa-likely-to-enter-the-2020-nfl-draft/">NFL draft insider Tony Pauline</a> said he’s hearing Tua is already telling people close to him that he plans to enter the 2020 draft.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Pauline had to say:</p>
      <blockquote>“I am told by people who are close to him [Tagovailoa] that Tagovailoa is telling people that he is very likely to enter the 2020 NFL Draft. This shouldn’t be a surprise – maybe it’s just an affirmation to some people. But I think right now, the chances of him returning to Alabama, from what I’m hearing from people close to him, are very, very slim.”</blockquote>
      <p>Tua’s recovery will be closely watched by every NFL team heading into the draft.</p>
      <p>The star quarterback has a long road to recovery in the coming months, but he is still expected to be a first-round pick at this point.</p>
