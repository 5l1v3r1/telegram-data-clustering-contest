      <p>NEW YORK — Officials say a Long Island Rail Road train has derailed in Queens, but there are no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>The commuter railroad tweeted that two cars of an eastbound train derailed just east of Jamaica station Friday night. A Metropolitan Transit Authority statement says the derailment took place around a half-hour after the 10-car train left Penn Station at 8:56 p.m., bound for Babylon.</p>
