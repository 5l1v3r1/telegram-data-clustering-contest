      <p>Andy Murray will not feature for Great Britain in their Davis Cup quarter-final tie against Germany on Friday after Kyle Edmund was once again picked for singles action.</p>
      <p>Murray was rested for the Group E victory over Kazakhstan on Thursday that secured Great Britain’s place in the knockout stages of the new-look tournament in Spain.</p>
      <p>Captain Leon Smith admitted after the 2-1 win that he was unsure if the Scot – who had laboured to a three-set victory over Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands in his team’s opening outing – would return to the line-up.</p>
      <p>And Edmund, who played instead against Kazakhstan, recording an impressive victory over Mikhail Kukushkin, has retained his spot in the line-up.</p>
      <p>His opponent in the opening match will be Philipp Kohlschreiber, with Dan Evans then going up against Jan-Lennard Struff.</p>

      <p>If required, Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski will once again team up for the doubles. Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies are scheduled to be their opponents.</p>
      <p>The winners of the tie will go up against either Argentina or hosts Spain – who also meet in Friday’s second session in Madrid – in the last four.</p>
      <p>In the other half of the draw, Russia knocked out Novak Djokovic’s Serbia courtesy of a hard-fought doubles win, Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov saving three match points before eventually prevailing. Next up will be Canada, who qualified for the semi-finals on Thursday.</p>
