      <p>Malin Andersson hasn’t had the easiest time since leaving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>, way back in 2016.</p>
      <p>The model’s mum died after battling cancer a year after she left the villa, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/23/malin-anderssons-month-old-baby-daughter-dies-8378307/">and tragically lost her baby girl Consy at the beginning of 2019</a>, just a month after she was born.</p>
      <p>And the 26-year-old has managed to come out the other side of her grief even more empowered than before, taking it upon herself to become an advocate for body positivity.</p>
      <p>She has shared countless photos of herself on social media – complete with stretch marks and cellulite – and has gained enormous praise for every single post.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to <b>Metro.co.uk</b> to promote her campaign with Scantilly lingerie, she opened up about being branded an inspiration for being so open and honest on social media.</p>
      <p>‘I’m receiving all sorts of messages. Personal stories, [people telling me] that I’m an inspiration, things about strength,’ she told us.</p>

      <p>‘It’s so beautiful to see. When I say I’m getting thousands of messages a day, I’m not even joking.</p>

      <p>‘People are watching because they’re wanting to feel more secure in themselves, they’re wanting to see healthy, good things on their feed when they wake up</p>
      <p>‘When you’re authentic, it’s a really nice feeling because you’re helping other people with it, especially younger women.’</p>
      <p>But Malin isn’t just here to promote body positivity, and is hoping to use her platform to discuss a huge range of topics – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/love-islands-malin-andersson-shares-harrowing-photo-bruised-face-shine-light-domestic-abuse-11172323/">including domestic abuse and grief</a>.</p>
      <p>The reality star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/19/love-islands-malin-andersson-bravely-shows-off-bruises-domestic-violence-awareness-10948272/">bravely shared photos of her bruised arms</a> and face on social media, in a bid to raise awareness for domestic abuse, and encourage people to talk about things that may be considered ‘taboo’.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not just the body image that I’m trying to portray, it’s also other things I’m trying to normalise. Domestic abuse, mental health, eating disorders, grief, baby loss, all of these things that need to be normalised that people don’t speak about,’ she continued.</p>

      <p>‘They just think that social media is glitz and glam, being an ex-reality TV star, that’s far from me now</p>
      <p>‘The journey is a personal journey as well, like with all the eating disorders I used to have and whatnot, it’s changed over time. It’s all about growth. And I’m a huge believer in that. When you go through certain things, you look at other things completely differently.’</p>

      <p>Discussing why she decided to share pictures of her bruises with her constantly-growing fanbase, she revealed: ‘It’s such a taboo, these women don’t speak about it. Women that goes through this, they’re too scared to speak up and sometimes they need a voice that’s bigger, that has a platform, and that can speak up for them.</p>
      <p>‘That’s what I feel like I’m doing. Women don’t speak up about it, and the amount of messages I’ve received about domestic violence is actually heartwrenching.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been a reason to people to go to the police, and that’s amazing.’</p>
      <p>While Malin didn’t go any further, she explained that – despite not being ‘over’ aspects of her past, she is hoping to use her experiences to help people in the future.</p>
      <p>‘I’m still not over certain things that I’ve gone through,’ she added.</p>
      <p>‘I have to find a reason for me to pick [myself] up, so if I can help other people with and share tips of what helps me, it can help someone else as well. Even if it’s just one person, that’s still change in my eyes.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Knowing there are plenty of women that are feeling better, and I’m helping them, even younger girls are reaching out to me about stretch marks or body dysmorphia, eating disorders, anything.</p>
      <p>‘You’re making a slight change, and as influences, we have a responsibility to influence in a right way.’</p>
