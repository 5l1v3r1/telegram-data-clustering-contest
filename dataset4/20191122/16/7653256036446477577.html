      <p>The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Enforcement-Directorate">Enforcement Directorate</a>, on Friday, arrested Sanjay Singal, former Chairman of Bhushan Power and Steel Limited in connection with an ongoing <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/money-laundering">money laundering</a> probe against him.</p>
      <p>ET had reported on October 19 that ED in its probe report had said that BPSL chairman Sanjay Singal had devised a “brilliant scheme to dress up the books of accounts” of the company.</p>
      <p>“BPSL had devised a peculiar modus operandi to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/siphon">siphon</a> funds obtained as loans from various banks/financial institutions,” the ED said. “Singals did not use the bank funds for the purpose for which the same were sanctioned, committed forgery and falsified accounts, causing wrongful loss to the lending banks.”</p>
      <p>In July, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/punjab-national-bank/stocks/companyid-11585.cms">Punjab National Bank</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/allahabad-bank/stocks/companyid-12284.cms">Allahabad Bank</a> had accused BPSL’s former promoters and directors of fraud in connection with loans given to the company.</p>
      <p>The ED said that during his questioning on October 3, Singal admitted to routing the amounts transferred by BPSL to various parties on account of purchase of goods, which never took place.</p>
      <p>Singal deposed in his statement that Rs 3,330 crore was routed to the accounts of four companies controlled by him out of the funds diverted from the accounts of BPSL in the shape of advances shown to various parties.</p>
      <p>It added that Singal conceded that the four companies – Jasmine Steel Trading, Marsh Steel, Diyajyoti Steel and Vision Steel – were promoters of BPSL that were ultimately owned and controlled by him and his family. The four companies infused Rs 3,330 crore in BPSL in the period from 2011-12 to 2016-17.</p>
      <p>BPSL has denied the allegations levelled against it.</p>
