      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/capcom">Capcom</a> is reportedly developing a remake of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/resident-evil"><i>Resident Evil 3</i></a> that’s poised to release as soon as next year. According to <i><a href="https://t.co/ql8aN1A34R">Eurogamer</a></i>, sources stated that a re-introduction of <i>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</i> is currently in the works, and many speculate it has been for some time.</p>
      <p>Capcom has already stated it’s likely to explore more remakes following the critical acclaim of this year’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/resident-evil-2"><i>Resident Evil 2</i></a>, which sold over 3 million copies in its first week. Sources also claim that there may not be any public announcement for a while, as Capcom is currently focusing on selling its multiplayer spin-off title <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Project-Resistance"><i>Project Resistance</i></a>.</p>
      <p><i>Resident Evil 3</i> originally released on the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Sony-PlayStation">PlayStation</a> in 1999 and focuses on Jill Valentine—one of the protagonists from the first game—as she traverses through the zombie-infested Raccoon City. During this time, Jill is pursed by the titular Nemesis, a biological weapon made by Umbrella Corporation to kill the rest of S.T.A.R.S. The antagonist functions similarly to the Tyrant in <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, but is much deadlier and intelligent.</p>
