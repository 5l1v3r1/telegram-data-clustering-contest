      <p>The 26-year-old student took to Twitter saying she scored zero in a quantum physics exam four years ago and wanted to quit Physics, but now she is in a top tier astrophysics PhD program and has published two papers. “STEM is hard for everyone - grades don’t mean you’re not good enough to do it,” she said referring to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Google CEO praised Nance’s tweet saying it is an inspiring story. </p>

      <p>“This reminds me... I really struggled with English for several years and still remember getting a 5 on a scale from 4-10. Now I'm doing a PhD in Oxford (ironically, the oldest uni in the English-speaking world) and I think most of the time people understand what I am saying,” tweeted a user. "Not quite STEM academics, but when I got to silicon valley I applied to 100+ jobs, rejected by all but the one that hired me. Six years later I’m a PM at Google doing *exactly* the kinds of products I love," replied another user.</p>
