      <h1>Bliss OS 12 Alpha brings Android 10 to desktop PCs</h1>

      <p>Android is for smartphones and tablets. Chrome OS is for laptops and desktops. That’s what Google’s been telling us for the past decade. But a small group of developers have been challenging that idea for almost as long — and thanks to their efforts you can now install  Android 9 or Android 10 on computers with x86 chips.</p>
      <p>The long-running <a href="https://www.android-x86.org/"><b>Android-x86</b> project</a> launched a <a href="https://www.android-x86.org/releases/releasenote-9-0-rc1.html">release candidate of their Android 9-based operating system</a> last week, and now the group is moving on to Android 10 — the team says the <a href="https://www.android-x86.org/source.html">q-x86 source</a> is now ready for developers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile developers and adventurous <i>non-</i>developers can already try out an early build of an Android 10-based desktop operating system thanks to the folks behind <a href="https://blissroms-x86.github.io/index.html"><b>Bliss OS</b></a>. <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/bliss-os-x86-pc-s-12-x-development-t4004419">Bliss OS 12 Alpha builds</a> are now available for download.</p>

      <p>Since these are still pre-release, alpha-quality builds with a number of known bugs. So Team Bliss wants to make sure you know what you’re in for before you try downloading and installing the operating system — and they’ve hidden a secret download code and instructions in a<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/bliss-os-x86-pc-s-12-x-development-t4004419"> post on the xda-developers forum</a> (you can also probably guess it from <a href="https://twitter.com/Bliss_ROMs/status/1195804403476901890">a recent tweet</a>).</p>
      <p>Once you’ve jumped through those hoops, you should be able to download Bliss 12 Alpha from the project’s <a href="https://blissroms-x86.github.io/index.html#download">download page</a> and install it by following the instructions at the <a href="https://docs.blissroms.com/">Bliss ROM documentation site</a>.</p>
      <p>Bliss is a fork of Android-x86 designed to run on most recent Chromebooks or Windows computers. Basically if you can run Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS, you should be able to run Bliss OS.</p>
      <p>The operating system has an a desktop-style launcher with a taskbar and start menu-like app drawer, the ability to run apps in windows, and support for touchscreen and non-touch devices.</p>
