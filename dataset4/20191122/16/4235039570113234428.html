      <p>Luxury lingerie company Victoria's Secret has <b>canceled</b> its annual <b>show</b> because of a slump in television ratings and increasing criticism of it, the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>The lavish <b>show</b> was first introduced in 1995 and became a major phenomenon in pop culture, attracting millions of viewers. Last year, however, it garnered the lowest ratings in its history, and its reviews were that it was sexist, old-fashioned and lacking heterogeneity.</p>
      <p>The parent company L Brands said it was important for the marketing strategy to evolve.</p>
      <p>“We will be communicating to customers, but nothing similar in magnitude to the fashion <b>show</b>,” </p>
      <p>"We're figuring how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers," Burgdoerfer said on a call with analysts Thursday.</p>
      <p>The most famous supermodels in the world took part in the annual Victoria's Secret show.</p>
      <p>It was the impetus for many of them, such as Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum, Miranda Kerr.</p>
