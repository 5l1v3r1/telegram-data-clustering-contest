      <p>BEIJING/GUANGZHOU/MUNICH (Nov 22): China's Great Wall Motor has gained domestic regulatory approval to build a factory in China together with BMW, it said on Friday, paving the way for the German carmaker to develop and build a low-emission Mini.</p>
      <p>Since February 2018, BMWwhich sells a little more than twomillion cars a year, and Chinese SUV manufacturer Great Wallwhich sold around onemillion vehicles last year, have tried to share the costs of building a low-cost electric vehicle on a joint platform to be used by both brands, but the project ran into regulatory hurdles.</p>
      <p>The project, with total investment of 5.1 billion yuan (US$724.4 million), will have annual capacity of 160,000 combustion engine cars for export, Great Wall said in a Shanghai Stock Exchange filing.</p>
      <p>The filing said plant construction will begin next year and be completed in 2022, although capacity for new energy vehicles has yet to be approved by authorities.</p>
      <p>A BMW statement said: "The initial focus of our cooperation with the Chinese manufacturer Great Wall is the joint research and development and the future local production of Mini electric vehicles."</p>
      <p>The German carmaker also said a further announcement about the joint venture will be made in the city of Zhangjiagang on Nov 29.</p>
      <p>The two manufacturers had envisaged building low-emission vehicles in China, but a trade dispute between China and the United States had led BMW executives to freeze plans for the creation of a Chinese export hub.</p>
      <p>"We have no basis for taking a decision at the moment. Whether this is financially viable and whether it makes sense, needs to be evaluated," BMW's Chief Executive told journalists at the Geneva car show in March.</p>
