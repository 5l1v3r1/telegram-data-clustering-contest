      <p>Glasgow's NHS board will be subject to 'special measures' following the tragic death of two children, it has been revealed.</p>
      <p>Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has announced the plans in a letter to the Health and Sport Committee at Holyrood.</p>
      <p>The board has been escalated to stage four of the NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework due to "ongoing issues relating to infection prevention, management and control at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children".</p>

      <p>This means an oversight board, chaired by Professor Fiona McQueen, Chief Nursing Officer, will be put in place to "ensure appropriate governance" to increase public confidence.</p>
      <p>The news comes after we revealed how 10-year-old Milly Main died at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Another child, Mason Djemat, three, also died in 2017.</p>
      <p>Both children were treated on a ward affected by water contamination at the Royal Hospital for Children, which is part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus.</p>
      <p>Freeman has stepped in follwoing whistleblowing claims about the scandal-hit QEUH first raised by Anas Sarwar MSP.</p>
      <p>Sarwar, Labour MSP for Glasgow, said: “Jeane Freeman has taken the correct course of action.</p>

      <p>I am writing to you following my statement to Parliament on Wednesday 20 November on the recent issues relating to infection prevention, management and control at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and Royal Hospital for Children (RHC).</p>
      <p>In light of the on-going issues around the systems, processes and governance in relation to infection prevention, management and control at the QEUH and the RHC and the associated communication and public engagement issues, I have concluded that further action is necessary to support the Board to ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence in these matters and therefore that for this specific issue the Board will be escalated to Stage 4 of our performance framework.</p>
      <p>This stage is defined as ‘significant risks to delivery, quality, financial performance or safety; senior level external transformational support required.’</p>
      <p>The intention of the escalation would ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence and strengthen current approaches that are in place to mitigate avoidable harms.</p>
      <p>As a result, an Oversight Board will be put in place, chaired by Professor Fiona McQueen, Chief Nursing Officer. </p>
      <p>Professor Craig White will continue to lead and direct the work required to improve the provision of responses, information and support to patients and their families and to now also to explicitly support improvements in the delivery of effective clinical governance and assurance within the Directorates identified through the work carried out to date.</p>
      <p>This will be augmented with specific support for Infection Prevention &amp; Control, communications and engagement.</p>
      <p>I will keep Parliament updated on the role of the Oversight Board and the actions that it is taking, as the work progresses.</p>
      <p>I have attached a copy of the letter to the Board and I have copied this letter to each of the party spokespeople on health and to Mr Sarwar given his particular interests and engagement on this matter.</p>
      <p>“The Glasgow health board is not fit for purpose, and this is a necessary step following the unforgiveable failings of senior management.</p>
      <p>“The focus now must be to tell parents, patients and the public the truth about infections at the hospital.</p>
      <p>“I pay tribute to the brave whistleblowers who came forward to shine a light on the catastrophic failings in the hope that nothing like this can ever happen again.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts are with Milly’s mum Kimberly and her family. She is one step closer to getting the truth.”</p>
