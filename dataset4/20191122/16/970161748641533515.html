      <p>With 2020 fast-approaching, it’s time to look ahead to some of the biggest things we can expect in the new year.</p>
      <p>We’ve already covered which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/waitrose-says-posh-crumpets-seaganism-tahini-biggest-food-trends-2019-11052272/">foods are set to be big for 2020</a>, along with upcoming <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/crystals-meditation-hottest-holistic-trends-2020-11176264/">holistic trends</a> – but what can we expect from the world of wellness?</p>
      <p>A number of experts have shared their thoughts on which wellness trends will dominate as we enter a new decade – and there are some interesting predictions.</p>
      <p>Take note of these new buzzwords – we’re likely to be hearing a whole lot more of them over the coming months.</p>
      <h3>Digital detoxing</h3>
      <p>Trends, in general, tend to resemble a swinging pendulum. Once a pendulum has gradually built up and swung too far one way, it needs to go plummeting back in the other direction.</p>
      <p>If we continue to do something so much that it climaxes, it will then stop and move in another direction. It will then go back in the same direction as before, once enough time has elapsed.</p>

      <p>Many think this will be the case for the way we use smart phones and devices in 2020. Currently, as a society we are obsessed with our phones – so much so its having a negative impact on our lives and our health.</p>
      <p>Coach and hypnosis trainer <a href="http://www.rebeccalockwood.org.uk/">Rebecca Lockwood</a> believes that 2020 will see a rise in people looking to detox from their phones – for the sake of their general wellbeing and mental health.</p>
      <p>She tells Metro.co.uk: ‘Dopamine is released each time we see a “comment” or a “like” on social media and each time we receive notifications on our smartphones.</p>
      <p>‘Our minds then become addicted to this feeling and the activity that creates it. This gives the side effect of constantly checking social media and smartphones.</p>
      <p>‘In 2020 we are going to see a rise of people coming to the realisation that experiences and being present in those moments create a far richer life than flocking to social media platforms and being glued to smartphones.</p>
      <p>‘Experiences are to be lived, and felt, it is no longer a time to pull out a phone to experience things, but to leave them in pockets.’</p>
      <h3>V-Care</h3>

      <p>The year of the vagina has <i>finally</i> arrived.</p>
      <p>V-care – short for vaginal healthcare – will be the term on everyone’s lips next year.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Taylor, the managing director of <a href="https://www.kegel8.co.uk/">Kegel8</a>, believes the past few years have seen a rise in women proudly reclaiming their bodies – but 2020 will see things explode in a big way.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She says: ‘In 2020, it will become common place to see FemTech products like vibrators, pelvic floor Kegel trainers and wearable devices sitting alongside shampoos, deodorants and fake tan on both physical and virtual beauty shelves.’</p>
      <p>Stephanie also believes that 2020 will be the year that period-tracking and ovulation apps will face stricter regulation – with the help of FemTech.</p>
      <p>So stay tuned for plenty more action.</p>
      <h3>DNA</h3>
      <p>It’s not just Lizzo who has taken a DNA test recently – DIY kits have exploded in popularity over the past few years.</p>
      <p>But experts predict that this fascination with DNA can be taken one step further in 2020 – to help with an individual’s health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Nathan Berkley, CEO of Muhdo Health said: ‘Few people are aware they can be used to improve your health and fitness, not just see your ancestry.</p>
      <p>‘DNA and epigenetics testing can be used to tell you details about your internal health, show you where you need to make changes to your diet and fitness regime and then allow you to monitor the impact on your body.</p>
      <p>‘In 2020, we will increasingly see everyone from professional athletes to those just wanting to get fitter incorporating DNA kits into their everyday training regimes, taking out the guesswork and ensuring that they stay on track to attain their fitness goals.’</p>
      <p>DNA testing can be used to tailor a person’s health regime and wellbeing activities, to ensure they are working best for their particular makeup.</p>
      <p>This the very definition of a personalised health and fitness regime.</p>

      <h3>Physical Intelligence</h3>
      <p>Physical Intelligence is the brainchild of Claire Dale and Patricia Peyton, who coined the phrase in their wellness book by the same name.</p>
      <p>The phenomenon sits alongside Emotional Intelligence and IQ – and is all about our ability to manage the balance of chemicals in our bodies that dictate how we feel, think and behave – making us more happy, fulfilled and successful overall.</p>
      <p>The pair say: ‘Eight key chemicals dictate how we think, feel, speak and behave.</p>
      <p>‘Physical Intelligence is our ability to detect and actively manage the balance of these chemicals in our bodies and brains using movement, posture, breathing and communication techniques in order to be our best self.</p>
      <p>‘We can alter our mood, emotional responses, stress, confidence and happiness levels at will using simple but effective mind-body techniques, integrated into our lives all day, everyday.’</p>
      <h3>Cannabis tea</h3>

      <p>The rise of CBD can be one of the biggest wellness takeaways from 2019, but the trend will continue to grow in 2020 – and is expected to become an everyday part of life.</p>
      <p>Michael Fitzgerald, the co-founder of <a href="https://bodyandmindbotanicals.com/">Body and Mind Botanicals</a> predicts cannabis tea is likely to become increasingly popular, as it’ll be easy to incorporate into everyday routines.</p>
      <p>He says: ‘Cannabis tea will be a hugely popular product next year as consumers are searching for the most natural and bio-available way to consume CBD. Cannabis tea delivers on both these points.</p>
      <p>‘The benefits are very far-reaching as the tea interacts with most cells in the body and the central nervous system. Cannabis tea in its rawest form it is packed full of CBDa which interacts with the body even better than CBD. It has been shown to help people relax, sleep better and relieve stress and anxiety.’</p>

      <h3>Ecotherapy</h3>
      <p>The healing power of nature is something that’s becoming more and more of a discussion point. So much so, that earlier this year a medical practice in Hulme, Manchester, started to prescribe gardening to people with anxiety and depression.</p>
      <p>This concept – known as ecotherapy – refers to any outdoor activity which positively impacts an individual’s health or wellbeing.</p>
      <p>This can be gardening, walking, horse-riding or anything that involves getting outside.</p>
      <p>Author Camille Knowles says: ‘It’s something that has become so important given we live in a society where we have to try and unplug ourselves from technology.</p>
      <p>‘Finnish researchers who’ve measured wellbeing levels and stress and anxiety before and after 20-minute walks have discovered that there is a remarkable difference in a boost in wellbeing moods and significant reduction in stress.</p>
      <p>‘Nature has incredible healing qualities so much so that ecotherapy treatment is being prescribed for stress and anxiety. This is because natural landscapes stimulate or rest the parasympathetic nervous system.’</p>
      <h3>Blue Mindfulness</h3>

        <figcaption>Take the plunge (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This wellness trend is inspired by the book Blue Mind by Wallace J Nichols – which outlines how water-based activities can change physical and mental health.</p>
      <p>Blue Mindfulness therefore refers to harnessing the power of water to soothe and calm us, in a number of ways.</p>
      <p>Activities such as wild swimming, surfing, sailing or simply walking along by a stream can all help to do so.</p>
      <p>Wellness coach <a href="https://seasoulblessings.com/">Pippa Best</a> says Blue Mindfulness is set to become a huge trend for 2020 – particularly with everyone being more eco-concious.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘Blue Mindfulness brings together our love of the big blue, with the increasingly popular pursuit of mindfulness, and a growing desire to follow David Attenborough’s lead and protect our oceans.</p>
      <p>‘It’s also a trend that links directly to growing concerns about climate change in 2019. Oceans have a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – and exponents of blue mindfulness are equally committed to protecting and preserving the water that inspires them.’</p>
