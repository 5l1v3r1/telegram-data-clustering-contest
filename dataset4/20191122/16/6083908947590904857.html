      <p>And in Laredo, a U.S. citizen wanted for sexual assault of a child was arrested after fleeing to Mexico. </p>
      <p>"U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Field Operations officers at the Laredo Port of Entry apprehended a traveler wanted on an outstanding felony warrant for sexual assault of a child," CBP issued in a release this week. "The apprehension occurred on Tuesday, Nov. 19 at the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge. CBP officers conducted a primary examination on a male traveler arriving from Mexico in a vehicle, and referred him to secondary for further inspection due to a possible match to an outstanding warrant."</p>
      <p>"CBP officers conducted a fingerprint check and utilizing national law enforcement databases confirmed his identity as 26-year-old Ramiro Alvarado Jr., a United States citizen wanted by the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office in Richmond, Texas on an outstanding felony warrant for Sexual Assault of a Child. Alvarado Jr. was transported to Webb County Jail pending extradition proceedings and warrant adjudication," the release continues.</p>
