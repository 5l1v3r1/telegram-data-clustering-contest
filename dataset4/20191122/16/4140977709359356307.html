          <p>As La Liga returns to the footballing fraternity with the international set of fixtures behind us, the predicament for Mallorca returns as well. With a mere 4 wins in 13 matches, the side find themselves struggling and languishing in 16th place in the league standings, a position which perfectly alludes to their bewilderment this campaign.</p>
          <p>However, what will buoy the side ahead of today’s gameweek 14 opener in the league is not only the identity of their opponents but the win the side managed to garner up in their foregone contest as well. It was only their second defeat in five matches but a pivotal one as they thumped Villarreal 3-1, a result they’ll be wishing serves as a revival to their remorse filled season when they face off against Levante today.</p>

                <p>And Levante who are only the three points above Mallorca as things stand will know that they can’t afford to undermine Mallorca for all their malicious showings. The 2-1 defeat the side suffered at the hands of Athletic Bilbao was a damaging one not only owing to the two match winning spree it curtailed for the side but also with it being their sixth defeat in 13 matches to see the side left yearning for consistency.</p>

                              <b>Levante</b>

                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>Top Scorer</h3>
                            <p>
                              <b>Levante</b>
                            </p>

                              <li>Mayoral: 3 Goals</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>

                            <h3>LET Vs MRC Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>If Mallorca are going to have any chance of emerging from this tie unblemished and without the aberration of yet another defeat, they’ll be requiring their shot stopper, Manolo Raine to be at the forefront of his skill set. He is bound to be peppered and pestered by a hoard of shots and even if he doesn’t emerge from a cleansheet from this one, the player is bound to get in a solid amount of save points to see him become our pick for the day.</p>
                            <h3>LET Vs MRC Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Although we don’t see either side shutting out their opponent in this one with both guilty of collapsing at the back and going off to sleep in defence, if there is any side which has a chance of emerging with a cleansheet, its Levante. The side have been relatively well versed in defence, letting in the 16 goals in 13 matches and up against a side who have managed to score just the 12 times, Levante will be striving to rebuff their defensive framework today.</p>
                            <p>It sees us get in all of the defensive picks from the side only with us moving in with Jorge Miramon, Sergio Postigo and Carlos Clerc for today’s impending encounter. </p>
                            <h3>LET Vs MRC Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Where Mallorca have struggled to traverse past defence and get goals, the side have made for an equally lacklustre sight in defence as well. They have gone onto ship 19 goals till now to see their goal difference stand at a sorry -7, one the home side will be looking to further plummet come this encounter.</p>
                            <p>It sees us begin with the selection from Levante in this docket of our Dream 11 contingent with us moving in for Jose Campana and Jose Luis Morales, two players who make for an intoxicating brew and will be looking to leave their opponents perplexed and exasperated today. Elsewhere, we have gone in with a trio of picks from Mallorca with Aleix Febas, Salva Sevilla and Lago Junior, a trio of players capable of intertwining their skill set in unison and manifesting ther ability to pile on the goals in this one.</p>
                            <h3>LET Vs MRC Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>We have the leading goal scorers represent us from either side over here, two players who have scored the three goals apiece till now to act as the talisman of their side’s attacking sojourns. If Mallorca and Levante are to emerge winners from this one, they’ll need to rely massively on their strikers in the form of Ante Budimir and Borja Mayoral respectively with the duo coming into our side for this one.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Mayoral will represent our side as the captain with Morales from the same side being opted for as the vice-captain.</p>
