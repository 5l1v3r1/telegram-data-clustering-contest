      <h1>Facebook Gaming poaches big Hearthstone Twitch streamer</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hearthstone/infinite-armour">Hearthstone streamer Jeremy ‘Disguised Toast’ Wang</a> is heading to Facebook Gaming, the social media site’s videogame streaming platform. The streamer has posted a video to Twitter announcing the surprise news to his fans – and donated $20k to a children’s hospital along the way.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the video (which you can check out below), Wang says, “Hey guys, I am moving platform,” waiting until the end of the video to reveal that his destination is none other than Facebook Gaming. It’s an interesting choice given that some other big streamers – like <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/ninja-raid-mixer">Ninja</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shroud-mixer">Shroud</a> – have instead moved to competitor streaming site Microsoft Mixer from Twitch in recent months.</p>
      <p>Wang also reveals that he decided to approach making the announcement in an unusual (and pretty darn heartwarming) way. He says he was given a $20k production budget to make the announcement, saying “every time a streamer moves they have this really cool produced video – and here I am, standing in a hotel room, filming this.” Instead of spending it, he took the cheque, drove down to Los Angeles Children’s Hospital, and donated it to them instead. Which is lovely.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, you guys don’t really care how it’s announced. You guys just care where I’m moving to,” the streamer says. “So, I’m moving to Facebook Gaming. Check me out there. Bye.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, Wang said an announcement of some kind would be arriving this Friday, posting a <a href="https://twitter.com/DisguisedToast/status/1197309267583221760">tweet</a> with some subtle hints about YouTube, Mixer, and Facebook (“I want to tell YOU all something. It’s time to FACE the facts. I have to MIX things up.”). Judging by the replies, fans weren’t sure where he’d be heading, so his announcement today is likely a bit of a surprise.</p>
      <p>Head over to Disguised Toast’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaming/DisguisedToast">Facebook Gaming page</a> if you’re keen to catch him in his new streaming home.</p>
