        <b>Gardaí are appealing for witnesses in relation to the death of 55-year-old Thomas Carton in Co Kerry.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was found at a house in Torc Terrace, Killarney on Wednesday night November 20th.</p>
      <p>Shortly after 10.00pm, Gardaí attended the scene and discovered his body.</p>
      <p>The body was removed and a post mortem was carried out at University Hospital Kerry on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say the results of the post mortem are not being released "for operational reasons."</p>
      <p>A senior investigating officer has been appointed and an incident room has been set up in Killarney Garda station.</p>
      <p>The scene is still preserved and a technical examination by the local Scenes of Crime Unit is ongoing.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say they are continuing to keep an open mind, and are trying to establish Mr Carton's movements in the days leading up to his death.</p>
      <p>They are particularly anxious to hear from people who may have seen or spoken to him recent days - or who may have any information whatsoever in relation to his death.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has any information is asked to contact Killarney Garda station on 064-667-1160, the Garda Confidential Line at 1800-666-111 or any Garda station.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are not investigating this incident as a murder at this time.</p>
