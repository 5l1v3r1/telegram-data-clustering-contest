      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:34:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Notre Dame looks to continue its hunt for a big bowl game this season in their home finale against Boston College.</p>
      <p>The Fighting Irish recovered from their <a href="https://thespun.com/independents/notre-dame-fighting-irish/kirk-herbstreit-rips-notre-dame-michigan-blowout">crippling loss to Michigan</a> with three straight wins over Virginia Tech, Duke and Navy. In that span they’ve outscored opponents 111-47. But with losses to Georgia and Michigan – the only elite teams on their schedule – a New Year’s Six game is the best they can hope for.</p>
      <p>Boston College are 5-5 and only need one win to clinch bowl eligibility for the sixth time in seven years. But the Eagles have the unenviable task of playing their last two games on the road. With Notre Dame on the slate this week and Pitt up next week, the Eagles will have a ton of work to do to reach that sixth win.</p>
      <p>The biggest X-factor in this game will likely be Boston College’s defense, which is ranked in the bottom half of the nation. With a unit allowing over 32 points a game, it’s understandable that the bettors would make Notre Dame a nearly three-touchdown favorite.</p>
      <p>Here are the details for the Boston College vs. Notre Dame game:</p>

      <p>ND is currently riding a decade-long winning streak against Boston College.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are certainly capable of giving a decent team a run for their money. But Notre Dame will likely prove too good to be at a real risk for an upset.</p>
