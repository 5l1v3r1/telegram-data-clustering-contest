      <h1>Injury Update For Detroit Lions QB Matthew Stafford</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:49:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The 3-6-1 Detroit Lions take on the 1-9 Washington Redskins this weekend hoping to avoid their fourth loss in a row. That task will become a lot harder – even against lowly Washington – without injured quarterback Matthew Stafford.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Stafford won’t be able to suit up for this one after all as he continues to recover from back fractures.</p>
      <p>According to Lions insider Tim Twentyman, Stafford has been ruled out for Sunday’s game against Washington.</p>

      <p>Stafford has missed the last two weeks of action due to the injury, leaving backup Jeff Driskel to carry the team.</p>
      <p>But while Driskel has been conservative with the ball, his play wasn’t good enough to beat the Chicago Bears or Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>Against Dallas, Driskell played a very efficient game, posting a 109.3 passer rating in a 35-27 loss.</p>
      <p>But playing against Washington has proven to be a useful cure for teams playing poorly. The Redskins might be winless were it not for a failed two-point conversion against Miami in Week 6.</p>
      <p>More than anything, head coach Matt Patricia will need to show that he can still win without Stafford. He’s 9-16-1 since being hired last year, and his Lions are on pace for yet another fourth-place finish in the NFC North.</p>
