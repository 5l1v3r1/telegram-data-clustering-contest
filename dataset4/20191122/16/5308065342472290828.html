      <p>Singapore—On the day after two Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) servicemen were convicted over the death of national serviceman and actor Aloysius Pang and their penalties were announced, a message from Jefferson Pang, the brother of the slain actor, was posted on social media, emphasizing that what is important is that future casualties must be avoided.</p>
      <p>Noontalk Media posted a note on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5CvhuSHJHq/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">Instagram</a> from Jefferson Pang on November 22, which read,</p>
      <h3>“My parents lost a son. We believe that 1 loss is enough. Other parents’ sons have a life ahead of them. Its not about blame and pointing fingers now but how it should be prevented in the future.</h3>
      <h3>Complacency shouldn’t be human error alone and preventive measures should be in place for future sons.</h3>
      <h3>A note from Jefferson Pang, Aloysius’ brother.”</h3>
      <p>A photo of the well-beloved young actor was also featured in the post.</p>

      <p>During the course of the trial, it was revealed that Aloysius Pang’s next-of-kin had asked for leniency for Third Sergeant (National Service) Hubert Wah Yun Teng, one of the SAF servicemen convicted of the death of the young actor, who was only 23 when he died.</p>
      <p>Adrian Wee, Mr Wah’s lawyer, disclosed this during Mr Wah’s mitigation, according to a report from <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/aloysius-pang-nsman-death-court-martial-charged-12106336">Channel NewsAsia (CNA)</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Wah Yun Teng admitted in military court on Tuesday, November 19, to having caused the death of the actor in January of this year. He pleaded guilty to one charge of causing death by a negligent act under the Penal Code, and another charge of a negligent act of endangering life under the SAF Act.</p>
      <p>After his admission of guilt, it was announced that Mr Wah would be demoted and made to pay a fine.  He will be demoted to the rank of Corporal, and be made to pay two fines: S$5,000 for the charge of causing death by a negligent act, as well as S$3,000 for a negligent act of endangering life.</p>
      <p>“Given that 3SG (NS) Hubert Wah was the junior commander, the fact that he activated the switch for the flick rammer, and one of the charges he faced was Section 304A(b) of the Penal Code, we are of the view that 3SG (NS) Hubert Wah’s culpability is higher than ME2 Ivan Teo.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, this fact is reflected in their respective sentences,” said Lieutenant-Colonel (NS) Shawn Ho, the General Court Martial president, who headed the three-member tribunal. Mr Ho is also a serving State Court judge, CNA reports. </p>
      <p>The other SAF serviceman accused in the death of Mr Pang, Military Expert 2 Ivan Teo Gee Siang, pleaded guilty to two charges of a negligent act of endangering life and another charge of disobedience of general orders.</p>
      <p>For these three charges, Mr Teo has been fined S$7,000 in all.</p>
      <p>Mr Teo’s clean service record, Mr Wah’s “almost unblemished” service record, and the fact that both men entered guilty pleas were taken into consideration in mitigation. -/TISG</p>
