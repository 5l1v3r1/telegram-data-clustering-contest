      <p>Cynthia Erivo has said it “took too long” to finally make a film about American abolitionist Harriet Tubman but she hopes the new movie in which she stars encourages more projects about black female heroes.</p>
      <p>The British actress plays the former slave who led more than a dozen missions to free others in Harriet.</p>
      <p>She told the PA news agency: “1. I’m glad that we are finally here. 2. I think it took too long and 3. I hope this serves as an example of what can be done and I hope it spurs people on to start telling more stories that centre black women in these heroic roles.</p>

      <p>“It’s the adventure story that we don’t ever get to see, it never happens and this is a really great moment to show that it’s possible.”</p>
      <p>Erivo, who is best known for her role in Widows and will soon be seen playing Aretha Franklin, said she felt the presence of Tubman while making the film.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is so weird when we finished shooting, the last day, I remember being in tears, hot tears, you know when your body can’t cool down and you’re proper crying, because it felt like I was holding on so tight to who she was and making sure she was represented in the right way because I felt like that was what she needed.</p>
      <p>“I would also ask to make the space safe for her to come in, I felt like she was there with us, which meant there was a huge responsibility to make sure what she was seeing was what she was happy with.</p>
      <p>“It took me a while afterwards to let her go, it took a lot emotionally, but I think it was necessary because if it didn’t I probably wouldn’t be doing it properly.”</p>
      <p>Erivo said she first learned about Tubman in school and added: “I had just never seen a woman like that, a woman that looked like me that did that, that changed the face of history.</p>
      <p>“That always stuck with me, I remember that distinctly.”</p>
      <p>Harriet is out now in UK cinemas.</p>
