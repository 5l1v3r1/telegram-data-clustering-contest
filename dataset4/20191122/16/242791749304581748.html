      <h1>Can You Pass Harvard's 1869 Entrance Exam?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:01:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">Leah Goldman</a></address>
      <p>The following 1869 Harvard entrance exam was supposed to be a breeze, believe it or not (via <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/1rNQ0I/www.good.is/post/can-you-pass-harvard-s-1869-entrance-exam-we-bet-not/">GOOD</a>).</p>
      <p>In those days colleges had to go out of their way to attract students. Harvard pointed out in a newspaper ad that <a href="https://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/remembering-when-college-was-a-buyers-bazaar/">185 of 210 candidates passed the entrance test</a> and were accepted in the previous year.</p>
      <p>But those candidates had the benefit of a focused prep school education.</p>
      <p>You will find <a href="http://spectrum.columbiaspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/harvardexam.pdf">this exam</a>, which ranges from geography to geometry to Latin, extremely difficult. Take a stab at the answers in the comment section.</p>
