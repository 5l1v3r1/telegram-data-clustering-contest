      <p>Up to date facilities are crucial in enabling students to thrive as they make the most of their university experience and prepare for future career success.</p>
      <p>At Liverpool Hope University more than £40m has been invested in its Hope Park campus alone over the past six years, enhancing the site as a place to study and socialise.</p>
      <p>What makes the university special though, is how these modern features and new buildings sit alongside striking traditional architecture and outdoor spaces to create a relaxing environment.</p>
      <p>Travelling to Liverpool Hope University couldn't be easier, as direct trains take less than two hours from Birmingham New Street station to Liverpool Lime Street.</p>
      <h3>Character-filled buildings</h3>
      <p>As Liverpool Hope University’s main teaching campus, Hope Park’s grand buildings and glorious grounds are in keeping with the site’s leafy Childwall surroundings.</p>

      <p>Once inside the campus, students will find Hope Park is home to the university’s health and sports science facilities  - including a gym with membership available for all students - as well as the learning resource filled Sheppard Worlock Library and an abundance of places to eat and drink.</p>
      <p>Brimming with character though, the campus’ exterior is sure to wow students from the moment they arrive.</p>

      <p>Over in central Liverpool, the university’s Creative Campus on Shaw Street houses state-of-the-art technology and performance spaces within Grade II-listed buildings which are certainly easy on the eye.</p>
      <p>Providing a place for the university’s School of Creative and Performing Arts subjects, this newly expanded site also mixes old and new as it’s where students will find the purpose-built Arts Centre along with the international arts focused Capstone Theatre and the Cornerstone Gallery exhibition space.</p>
      <h3>Glorious gardens</h3>

      <p>Landscaped gardens are lined with flowers, shrubs and fabulous fountains, creating the perfect environment for students to forget about the stress of university life and relax and socialise outdoors.</p>
