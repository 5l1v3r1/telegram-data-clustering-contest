      <h1>Google Pixel phones get ‘Light Painting’ mode w/ this Google Camera mod</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:16:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>The cameras on Google’s Pixel phones are great mainly thanks to their software and now, thanks to some developers, a new mode is available. With a Google Camera mod, all Pixel phones are getting a “Light Painting” mode.</p>
      <p>With Google’s Pixel 4, the Camera app’s software has been upgraded to the point of quite literally being able to capture the stars <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/pixel-4-astrophotography-edit/">with some stunning results</a>. One part of that feature that a few have had luck with is the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/06/pixel-4-light-trails-astrophotography/">ability to capture light trails</a>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it’s a little tricky to use astrophotography on Pixel for anything outside of shooting the night sky. That’s where a modified version of the Google Camera app comes into play. Highlighted by the folks over at <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-camera-px-mod-manual-forced-astrophotography-light-painting-mode-pixel/"><i>XDA-Developers</i></a>, Camera PX has been updated to add two new buttons. The first is to force the Astrophotography mode.</p>
      <p>The second is a bit more interesting. A new “Light Painting” mode for Pixel phones allows the device to capture light trails using a slight tweak on Astrophotography. You’ll still need to use a tripod to get usable results, but having the manual buttons is handy when dealing with less than ideal lighting and angles where Astrophotography wouldn’t typically trigger.</p>

      <p>Camera PX will add this Light Painting and forced Astrophotography modes to all Pixel smartphones including Pixel 4, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and even the older Pixel 2 and Pixel 1 devices. Of course, <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=80974497&amp;postcount=1888">you’ll need to sideload the app manually</a> to use it.</p>
