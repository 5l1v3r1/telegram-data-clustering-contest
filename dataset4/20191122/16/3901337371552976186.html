      <p>Known for his clashes with other managers, Jose Mourinho has seemingly already upset one of his managerial counterparts despite being just two days into his new job – here is why!</p>

      </p>
      <p>The new Tottenham Hotspur coach has poached two backroom staff members from LOSC Lille, namely his new assistant manager Joao Sacramento and goalkeeper coach Nuno Santos, who both worked under Christophe Galtier in France.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, it will not surprise many that the coach of the Ligue 1 side is not too pleased with the former Manchester United boss' actions.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has their own way of doing things," Lille manager Galtier said, as quoted by <i>ESPN</i>, before adding sarcastically: "But it's really classy. Really classy to act like that."</p>

      <p>Mourinho is said to also be keen to lure Lille sporting director Luis Campos to Spurs, but Galtier has insisted any offer for him will fall on deaf ears.</p>
      <p>"Luis is 200% invested in the project and I don't see a 1000th of a wish to look elsewhere. We're close and looking forward," he added.</p>
      <p>Somewhat surprisingly, Lille finished in second place in Ligue 1 last season after avoiding relegation to Ligue 2 on the last day of the 2017/18 campaign.</p>
