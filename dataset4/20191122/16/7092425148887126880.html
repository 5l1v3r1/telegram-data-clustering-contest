        <b>Olivier Giroud could price himself out of a January exit from Chelsea due to his sky-high wage demands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Giroud is out-of-favour at Stamord Bridge, with boss Frank Lampard putting his faith in Tammy Abraham this season.</p>
      <p>Abraham has rewarded Lampard by netting 11 goals and is could spell the end of Giroud’s spell in west London.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman wants out of the club just two years after joining from Arsenal with the 33-year-old keen to play first-team football and boost his chances of a spot in France’s line-up at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>A host of clubs are queuing up to get Giroud - but he’s refusing to leave on the cheap.</p>
      <p><i>The Express</i> report the striker wants a two-year contract worth a mega £7m-a-season to leave Chelsea.</p>
      <p>And that could spell the end of interest from the likes of Marseille, Montpellier, Lyon, Crystal Palace and Inter Milan .</p>
      <p>Antonio Conte’s Inter are just one side pausing their interest in light of Giroud’s lofty demands.</p>
      <p>They’ve got Alexis Sanchez on the books and fighting back to fitness after a dislocated ankle, but are only prepared to put an 18-month deal on the table for the ageing frontman.</p>
      <p>Chelsea want around £5m for Giroud, who is available for nothing in the summer when his contract runs down.</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace have been keen on the player, but are now eyeing up Celtic’s Odsonne Eduard instead.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is seen as a better long-term investment, and the 13 goals in 24 games striker is now at the head of their shopping list.</p>
      <p>France boss Didier Deschamps explained why he’s kept Giroud in his recent squads despite his lack of action at Chelsea: "He is useful and indispensable. He is very effective and made the decision to shoot the penalty. He allows players around him to have goal chances too.</p>
      <p>"Which also explains why he stays with us despite his playing time at Chelsea. He suffers inevitably from this situation on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>"If he has an opportunity to move and have more playing time, it's good for him, he knows it."</p>
