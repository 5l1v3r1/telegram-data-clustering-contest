      <p>Media mogul, Toke Makinwa has admonished the fans of <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">BBNaija</a> reality TV show to stop putting pressures on their favourite housemates.</p>
      <p>This follows series of social media fights and how fans continue to create enmity between the top housemates.</p>
      <p>According to Makinwa, it’s been a long time she expressed her views on such issues, but BBNaija fans need to focus more on better things.</p>
      <p>She tweeted “Been so long since I aired my thoughts on social issues cos I’m busy building my empire but you BBrothernaija fans really need to stop tripping and putting so much pressure on your favourite housemates…”</p>

      <p>The OAP also maintained that the fans were causing more harm than good saying ” stop putting them against each other, the show is over let them focus on building their lives, this type of constant competition causes depression, just quit already,”.</p>
      <p>Further speaking, she said “You can support your favourite housemate outside the house without fighting and insulting yourselves or other housemates, get your own lives on and leave them to figure this new phase, we are all tired.</p>

      <p>“The industry is hard as it is, they are not yet even in the industry, all the noise does not bring success, it doesn’t help anyone. Ask the other housemates, some of them had to start from scratch, let people focus and do what they need to do to really succeed,” she concluded” she added.</p>
