      <p>I'm a Celebrity... is back on our screens for 2019 and with it is the usual visual feast of squirming soap stars and reality TV rejects crunching, munching and gagging on a grim buffet of Australian offal and creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>But don't worry, it's not just celebs who get to have all the fun.</p>
      <p>For the first time, Nottingham folk can get involved, with a new Bush Tucker Trial kiosk opening in Lower Parliament Street nightclub, Pryzm.</p>
      <p>For just £2, brave souls can take part in the I'm a Civilian... Get Me Out of Here! challenge, a light supper consisting of a five-course insect-inspired meal.</p>

      <p>Served on a shot glass paddle, dare devils can tuck into a tasting menu of crickets, grasshoppers, buffalo worms and mealworms, served with a chaser of scorpion-infused vodka and a shot of fruit squash to rinse the after-taste away.</p>
      <p>To add to the authenticity of the I'm a Celeb-style challenge, deputy manager Tom Dodd has enlisted the help of the club's very own Kiosk Keith (or Kiosk Kev of late), who will be serving up the scran.</p>
      <p>Tom says: "Does he have an Australian accent? No. But am I genuinely going to make him try to do one? Yes."</p>
      <p>The pop-up has been given a thoroughly Aussie make-over too, largely made from props pilfered from other rooms of the venue.</p>

      <p>"It cost £36 in total," says Tom, the man also behind the pigs in blankets pop-up and care home disco afternoons.</p>
      <p>"The wooden pallets are what the deliveries come on, the chests and boxes we served drinks out of, the camouflage we had from Halloween, the plant is from the Tiki room, and the red lamp is left over from the original Oceana revamp," adds Tom.</p>
      <p>The pop-up will be open throughout December up to New Year's Eve.</p>
      <p>All money raised from the challenge will be donated to ECHO Trust, a children’s charity providing grants which will enable the purchase of vital medical equipment.   </p>
      <p>Tom ordered the bugs, which are all dead and have been specially modified for human consumption, from Amazon and will be buying more as needed.</p>

      <p>Pryzm general manager Andy Swinnerton was brave enough to be the first to give the pop-up menu a try. Chowing down and almost choking on a cricket (which at almost an inch long is nothing to laugh at), it was a mixed verdict.</p>
      <p>He says: "It is very nutty but those feathery wings do tickle your throat as you swallow. Not too bad though."</p>
