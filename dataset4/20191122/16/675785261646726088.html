      <h1>Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr stadium almost finished - and has plush VIP section</h1>
      <h2>The rematch venue for Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr is taking shape - and the purpose-built facility in Saudi Arabia includes plush VIP areas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:35:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>The purpose-built stadium for Anthony Joshua's eagerly-anticipated rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr is nearly complete.</p>
      <p>And footage of the 15,000 capacity venue has been shared by Matchroom CEO Frank Smith, showing a plush VIP section as well as standard seating.</p>
      <p>The arena features an open bowl of temporary seating across three sides of the ring.</p>
      <p>On the other end is a vast area featuring several tiers of balconies with padded chairs and tables for VIPs to enjoy the action.</p>
      <p>It is believed the changing rooms and backstage areas are underneath that hospitality section, with a tunnel in the middle appearing to show the ramp where fighters will make their walk to the ring on December 7.</p>

      <p>Joshua is facing the biggest fight of his career as he aims to avenge his shock June 1 defeat and reclaim his world heavyweight title belts.</p>
      <p>But he insisted this week he is still a champion and isn't about to "become a p***** overnight".</p>

      <p>“We haven’t done anything differently mentally, I’m a champion,” he said defiantly. “I walked into the gym and three years later I was Olympic champion.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had one loss, but I’m not about to become a p***** overnight and not be able to fight.</p>
      <p>“I can fight, that’s it. I don’t need to reflect on that, I just need to win.”</p>

      <p>He has gone back to the drawing board and drafted in a number of new sparring partners during his Sheffield training camp.</p>
      <p>But trainer Rob McCracken, who came in for plenty of criticism after his June 1 loss, insists he has no regrets about his handling of the first bout.</p>
      <p>McCracken said: "As a trainer you've got to be honest with yourself - you've got to be able to look yourself in the mirror after a fight and ask yourself, did I do the right thing for that boxer?</p>

      <p>Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.</p>
      <p>Former super-middleweight world champion George Groves provides expert analysis.</p>
      <p>To watch the latest show in full, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdmmigRSAo&amp;feature=youtu.be">click here</a>.</p>
      <p>"The moment you think they have no chance of getting back into it, that's when you should step in and be brave, and take all the criticism you've going to get in the other way.</p>
      <p>"At no point did I think that Big Josh had no chance of getting back into that fight. I've always had the best intentions of every boxer at heart and I would never leave them in a moment long enough to be in danger.</p>

      <p>"In hindsight there are always things you can do better. If you can't learn from something and do better next time, you've got a problem.</p>
      <p>"It was a difficult night in New York - as difficult as it can get. There was always going to be criticism and some sort of backlash, but I've been through it all in boxing and I've got a thick skin.</p>
      <p>"People will analyse and have an opinion, and some will be valid and some won't be. From my point of view my first responsibility was a duty of care to AJ on the night, and I think I did my job."</p>
