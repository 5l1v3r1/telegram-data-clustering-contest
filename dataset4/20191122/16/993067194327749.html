      <p>A BELFAST man who stole £6,500 from his employer to fund his gambling addiction wept in court today as he was spared jail.</p>
      <p>Stuart Kennedy (25) was handed a six-month sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted stealing money from the Nationwide Building Society.</p>
      <p>Belfast Crown Court heard that between April 23 and May 4 last year, Kennedy - a cashier at the Carrickfergus branch - stole money which he then gambled at a local Ladbrokes.</p>
      <p>A prosecutor said that last May, an internal investigation was launched within the branch after it emerged that £6,500 was missing from the till operated by Kennedy.</p>
      <p>He was the only employee who had access, and was the sole holder of the key and a unique pin code needed to open the till. When a fraud investigator with the Nationwide questioned Kennedy, he initially denied the theft but admitted having a gambling problem.</p>
      <p>He later confessed that over the short period of offending, he was stealing around £1,000 a day which he then gambled. When CCTV footage from the branch was viewed, it showed Kennedy taking the money.</p>
      <p>When arrested, he admitted the theft and said it was his intention to replace what he took with his winnings.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor then confirmed to Judge Philip Gilpin QC that Kennedy, from Castle Avenue in Belfast, has now paid back the full amount.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Mark Farrell said it was accepted that Kennedy's offending was a grave breach of trust - but noted that due to his repayment "Nationwide are not out of pocket, thankfully".</p>
      <p>Mr Farrell said Kennedy was a man with a good working background, and from a stable, supportive family. The barrister also spoke of Kennedy's shame and regret for what he did, which was set against a backdrop of a "very difficult and crippling gambling addition".</p>
      <p>Passing sentence, Judge Gilpin told Kennedy that while this type of offending usually attracted a custodial sentence, he was taking into account his lack of criminal record and the fact all the money had been paid back.</p>
      <p>The judge also noted Kennedy has sought treatment for his gambling addiction.</p>
      <p>As he handed Kennedy a six-month prison sentence, which was suspended for two years, Judge Gilpin warned the defendant that if he offended over the next two years, he faced being sent to jail.</p>
      <p>Before leaving the dock, a tearful Kennedy addressed the judge and said "thank you".</p>
