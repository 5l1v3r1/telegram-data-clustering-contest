      <h1>Joanna Jedrzejczyk: ‘I want to be the female BMF’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Joanna Jedrzejczyk wants the world to know females can be ‘bad motherfu-kers’ too’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/martial-arts/mixed-martial-arts/article/3038534/ufc-joanna-jedrzejczyk-says-she-deserves">South China Morning Post</a> in a recent interview, the former UFC strawweight queen said she has been inspired by American Top Team teammate (ATT) and newly-crowned ‘BMF’ champion Jorge Masvidal to become the UFC’s first ever female BMF champ.</p>
      <p>“People used to call me violent, savage,” Jedrzjecyzk said. “Jorge just won the belt – the baddest motherf*cker belt. I want to be the female BMF.”</p>
      <p>“These [other] girls can make it, they can win the belt, but there’s nobody like Ronda Rousey, like me,” she added. “People can doubt me, and they’ll do that forever, but show me a better, cleaner fighter in the UFC or in general. Of course, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/377/amanda-nunes">Amanda Nunes</a> is the GOAT right now, but Ronda Rousey had six successful title defenses, me, five. Rose [Namajunas]? One title defense. Jessica [Andrade] couldn’t defend the title.”</p>
      <p>FBMF title aside, Jedrzejczyk is currently focused on reclaiming the strawweight title she lost to Rose Namajunas in 2017. The Polish MMA veteran is expected to take on newly-minted strawweight champ Weili Zhang in the new year, although no date or venue has been announced.</p>
      <p>“I want to be strawweight champ again,” Jedrzejczyk<a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/10/20932344/joanna-jedrzejczyk-will-eventually-return-to-flyweight-but-i-want-to-be-strawweight-champ-again"> told MMA Fighting</a> following her win over Michelle Waterson last month. “The weight cut went smooth and easy, and I’m very excited to step into the Octagon with Weili Zhang. I’m super excited about that.”</p>
