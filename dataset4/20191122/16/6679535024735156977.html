      <p>Former Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Revanna, former Congress MLA K.B. Chandrashekar and others sought support from the people during their day-long roadshows in different parts of K.R. Pet taluk in the district on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mr. Revanna canvassed for his party candidate B.L. Devaraj at Mambahalli, Katte Kyathanahalli, Somanahalli, Alambadi Kaval and other villages.</p>
      <p>Addressing the public, the former Minister said that Mr. Devaraj has done tremendous development works in Akki Hebbal constituency as a zilla panchayat member since several months.</p>
      <p>“It is my father’s [former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda] dream to make [Mr.] Devaraj a MLA,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to Mr. Revanna, the previous Congress-JD(S) State coalition government had allocated ₹700 crore for the development of K.R. Pet Assembly constituency.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Chandrashekar, Congress nominee in the December 5 byelections, campaigned in many villages in the vicinity of Anuvinakatte.</p>
      <p>The Congress is the only party that had worked for the development of the country, he said.</p>
      <p>He urged the people to reject the BJP candidate as he and other disqualified MLAs have caused financial burden on the State by tendering resignation to their posts.</p>
