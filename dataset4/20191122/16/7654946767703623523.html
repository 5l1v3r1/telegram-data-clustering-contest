      <h1>Streets near Rockefeller Center will be closed to cars for the holidays</h1>

      <p>It’ll be Walk-efeller Center!</p>
      <p>Streets around Rockefeller Center will be closed to cars from Nov. 29 through the New Year to make more space for the crush of pedestrians during the holiday season, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday.</p>
      <p>“Literally, each year, more and more people are coming, it’s creating a real safety issue and we want to protect those folks,” de Blasio said on WNYC.</p>
      <p>“This historic announcement pedestrianizing Rockefeller Center will keep holiday revelers safe while ensuring minimal disruption to the rest of the life of the city,” the mayor later said in a statement. The city has closed the area before, but only on an ad hoc basis.</p>
      <p>The city will use “movable barriers to institute full or partial street closures that will alleviate the crush of foot traffic,” according to a City Hall press release.</p>
      <p>The mayor said that 49th and 50th streets between Fifth and Sixth avenues will be closed “for much of the day” — specifically from 2:00 p.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday, 1:00 p.m. to midnight on Friday, and 10:00 a.m. to midnight on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>A lane of traffic along both the east and west sides of Fifth Avenue between 48th and 52nd streets will be reserved for pedestrians between at least 5:00 p.m. to midnight during the week, and by noon on the weekends. During those periods no turns will be allowed on 47th, 49th or 51st streets.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the east side of Sixth Avenue will be blocked off between 48th and 52nd streets at certain times depending on crowd conditions. MTA buses will skip stops in that area.</p>
      <p>When the Post first reported on the planned closures last month de Blasio said the plan was just an idea that hadn’t been approved by City Hall, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/de-blasio-slams-brakes-on-dots-fifth-avenue-holiday-agenda/">tossing his transportation commissioner under the bus.</a></p>
      <p>“Anything that involves blocking off streets comes with real ramifications as well, so the point is we need to weigh all those factors and that has not been done yet,” de Blasio said at an unrelated press conference on Nov. 6.</p>
      <p>De Blasio’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/de-blasio-needs-to-do-something-serious-about-the-rockefeller-center-holiday-horrors/">slow-walking of Rockefeller Center pedestrianization plans</a> earned him the ire of  The Post’s pro-commuter editorial board, which demanded Hizzoner address the dangerous crowding conditions on Rockefeller Center’s sidewalks, where hoards of locals and tourists jostle for space during the holidays.</p>
      <p>Despite de Blasio’s sturm and drang, the plans City Hall laid out Friday are almost identical <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/two-lanes-on-fifth-avenue-to-close-for-pedestrians-during-holidays/">to the original proposal introduced in October.</a></p>
      <p>The NYPD and city’s Department of Transportation will monitor the area and move barriers if necessary depending on weather and crowds.</p>
      <p>The plan got one thumb up, one thumb down from MTA President Andy Byford.</p>
      <p>“While the MTA fully supports safe pedestrian access for New Yorkers and visitors during this busy holiday time, we are disappointed that the plan put forward by the Mayor gives no priority to MTA buses and ignores the needs of bus customers,” he said in a press statement.</p>
      <p>“This unilateral decision flies in the face of the work that the MTA has done with NYC DOT to speed up bus times, decrease dwell times and increase ridership across our system.</p>
      <p>“The plan also lumps MTA buses in with cars and trucks – the exact opposite of our collaborative efforts with the City on the success of the 14th Street busway, the innovative bus lane camera enforcement (ABLE) program and transit priority citywide.</p>
      <p>“Thousands of buses travel these lanes every day getting riders where they need to go for the holidays to see family and friends, and the plan as put forward will only serve to increase congestion and result in slower speeds for our passengers.”</p>
      <p>Drivers, meanwhile, panned the proposal, saying it would bring gridlock and delay vehicle deliveries.</p>
      <p>“It’s a s–t show even when [the streets] are not closed,” said Jim Heaning, 66, who moves props of all sizes for Saturday Night Live.</p>
      <p>“We gotta get props in and out of the building,” via the “30 Rock” loading dock on 50th Street.</p>
      <p>“We hate Christmas!” he joked.</p>
      <p>“I can see closing one or the other, but not both,” he lamented of 49th and 50th streets.</p>
      <p>“Seriously. You’re isolating this building! … I mean, Jimmy Fallon is in here, Seth Meyers is in here, the news is in here, SNL is in here, and all of them need their props!”</p>
      <p>Fellow props-wrangler Larry Demmler, 32, agreed. “Once they light that tree! I’m a big fan of Christmas, just not in this two-block radius.”</p>
      <p>Still, the crowds already make driving impossible, so it’s best to close the streets to cars altogether, said Leslie Cruz, 26, a “lobby ambassador” for Rockefeller Center.</p>
      <p>“To keep people safe, this is the best bet,” she said.</p>
