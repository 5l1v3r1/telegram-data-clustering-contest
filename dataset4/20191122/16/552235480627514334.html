      <h1>Austin MacPhee blasts BBC Hearts pundit Allan Preston's 'four lies' in withering response</h1>
      <h2>The interim Hearts boss isn't happy with the BBC pundit and agent Allan Preston.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:53:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Angered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">Austin MacPhee</a> has laid into Allan Preston after the BBC radio pundit questioned his credentials.</p>
      <p>The caretaker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> boss is fuming with the former Jambo who launched a verbal attack live on air two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Preston – who is also an agent – left MacPhee without a name as he accused the 40-year-old putting "two fingers up to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a>" – and being "tactically all over the place".</p>
      <p>Now the man who could become the new Tynecastle sporting director has hit back with an evisceration of his own.</p>
      <p>Seething, MacPhee said: "The results I have had as the manager speak for themselves. I mentioned them last week and prior to the game I spoke with confidence about what I  thought the team could achieve in that game and where I think the club can go.</p>
      <p>"I know in particular Allan Preston on the BBC opened the program before the game by trying to discredit me with four different statements in particular which were just lies which I was very disappointed with.</p>

      <p>"I thought it was a slight on the players, a slight on the club and for the BBC's voice of Hearts to make these statements I thought was very poor because, for example, he stated that all we were doing was bringing in players from Manchester City's academy.</p>
      <p>"I believe the difference between a lie and an error is if it's done with malice and I believe that if you open the show heavily critical of me then back it up with four points which are factually incorrect I believe that's four lies.</p>
      <p>"So the first one was that we are bringing in players from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>'s academy. That's fabrication, it's not true. Ryo signed for €1m from Gamba Osake, he didn't set foot in Manchester City's Academy.</p>
      <p>"The second one was that Craig Wighton was brought in from nowhere so I could stick two fingers up to Craig Levein. That is a complete lie.</p>
      <p>"Craig Wighton, in his last two games when he was fit and available started at Parkhead then came on in the Cup Final before suffering a medial ligament injury in preseason at Inverness so the Rangers game was the first game that he could be selected.</p>
