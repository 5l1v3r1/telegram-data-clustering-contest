      <h1>The Original Fiend: WWE's Mankind Was Ahead of His Time (and Beyond Today)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:11:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sergio Pereira</a></address>
      <p>It's official. The current <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> Universal Champion "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt is the hottest property in the WWE right now. It's testament to the superstar's ability to reinvent himself and stay ahead of the curve, as he evolved from Husky Harris to cult leader Bray Wyatt and now as the sinister Fiend.</p>
      <p>That being said, Wyatt took a page out of another legend's book to craft his persona (and finishing move). There's no two ways about it, the Fiend is a homage to WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley's Mankind.</p>

      <p>In 1996, Foley joined the WWE (then known as the WWF) after having established himself as Cactus Jack in WCW, ECW and around the globe. Rather than use the name and violent persona, however, Foley crafted a new creepy gimmick called Mankind.</p>

      <p>As Mankind, Foley portrayed a mentally deranged wrestler who wore a leather mask, pulled out his own hair, squealed during matches and appeared in spooky vignettes. Even before he debuted in the squared circle, fans were curious about this new superstar, who was far more threatening than any of the other talent at the time.</p>
      <p>Mankind destroyed jobbers and "paralyzed" them with his mandible claw finisher, before quickly entering the title picture and challenging "The Heartbreak Kid" Shawn Michaels for the belt. While he didn't dethrone Michaels, he was booked strongly in their five-star matches and soon entered into a program with the company's resident reaper, the Undertaker. This feud carried on for years, even resulting in Foley's iconic fall from the top of Hell in a Cell structure at the 1998 King of the Ring pay-per-view.</p>

      <p>While Mankind was an indisputable heel when he arrived, his work rate and commitment grew on the fans and they began to cheer for him after a while. From then on, he became a fan-favorite and won the WWF Championship as Mankind in 1999.</p>
      <p>The Mankind character, though, had evolved from what it was initially. Gone was the sinister and demented loner, making way for a more comical, broken goof who utilized Mr. Socko -- an aptly named sock puppet -- to apply the mandible claw to his opponents. It proved to be a smart move, too, as Mankind became a staple of the Attitude Era and cemented himself as revolutionary superstar in the history books.</p>
      <p>Foley debuted in a time when the company experienced a dip in creativity and competition from a legitimate rival in WCW. There were garbageman, clowns, goons and dentists on the programming as the powers-that-be struggled to get in touch with what the audience wanted. It was characters like Mankind and Stone Cold Steve Austin, though, that pushed the company into the Attitude Era and one of wrestling's most successful periods.</p>

      <p>The Fiend is doing something similar now. As WWE delves into divisive angles and subpar storylines while its new rival AEW grows in popularity, Wyatt is becoming a drawcard for the audience. If anything, he's developing into an antihero due to his popularity and desire to push boundaries.</p>
      <p>In many ways, Mankind paved the way for Wyatt's persona -- and it isn't lost on the superstar. While Wyatt remains in-character even when he tweets, he added a special message to Foley the one time. Foley acknowledged this in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/08/mick-foley-on-bray-wyatt-using-the-mandible-claw-658456/">Wrestling Inc.</a></i> and even passed the proverbial torch for Wyatt to use the mandible claw. "People can read between the lines, but even in his tweet – he generally tweets in character and he said, 'I'm sorry, but thank you.' I certainly took that as a nod of appreciation and I like that," he said.</p>
      <p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and it's especially true here. Mankind lay the foundation for the Fiend to become what he is, and now it's up to Wyatt to achieve the same success and legacy as Mrs. Foley's baby boy.</p>
