      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Federal Reserve Bank</a> of New York's latest Nowcasting Report published on Friday, the United States' (US) economy is expected to expand by 0.7% in the last quarter of the year, compared to the previous week's estimate of 0.4%.</p>
      <p>"News from this week's data releases increased the nowcast for 2019:Q4 by 0.3 percentage point," the NY Fed said in its press release. "Positive surprises from housing data drove most of the increase."</p>
      <p>Markets largely ignored this publication and the US Dollar Index was last up 0.28% on a daily basis at 98.23.</p>
