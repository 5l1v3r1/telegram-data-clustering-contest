      <h1>GBP/USD to remain rangebound with expectations firmly around a Conservative win - ING</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:39:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>Previewing the potential impact of next week's macroeconomic events on the GBP/USD pair, "Next week’s calendar will lack market-moving data releases, which will leave GBP being solely driven by the expectations around the elections (that are now only 20 days away)," said ING analysts.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>"In particular, we expect any market move to be triggered either by new opinion polls or pre-electoral promises. Latest surveys indicate that the Conservatives are cementing their lead over the Labour party: the seven-day average of poll numbers suggest Tories will be able to secure 43% of the preferences, the Labour party 29% and the Lib Dems 15%."</p>
      <p>"In terms of the pre-election pledges, the recently-published Labour manifesto (e.g. tax hikes, nationalisation projects) has spurred fears about a negative impact on businesses if Jeremy Corbyn became the winner. Should the polls start to indicate a more balanced result, raising the chances of a Labour win, we could see some negative spill-over effect on the market. For now, with expectations firmly around a Conservative win, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">sterling</a> is likely to remain rangebound."</p>
