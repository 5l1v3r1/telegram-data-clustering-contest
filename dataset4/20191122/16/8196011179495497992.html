      <p>As part of her visit, the Minister noted and welcomed the important role played by the Crawford as the only National Cultural Institution located in its entirety outside Dublin and congratulated them on the success of their Sunday openings and new family-friendly schedule which sees the gallery open to the public seven days a week.</p>
