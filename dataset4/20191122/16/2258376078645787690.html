      <p>SASKATOON -- Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation Chief Ronald Mitsuing has declared a state of crisis and emergency in the northwest Sask. community after three suicides in recent weeks - with the latest involving a 10-year-old child.</p>
      <p>“We’re all recovering from a sleepless night,” band manager Barry Chalifoux said.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s suicide is the third suicide this month. Last week a father in his early 40s died, and earlier this month a 14-year-old died by suicide.</p>
      <p>“We’re in a place where we’re physically and emotionally unable to deal with this properly,” Chalifoux said.</p>
      <p>The First Nation has seen seven suicides in the last three years, he said.</p>
      <p>“Chief Mitsuing and I both feel our staff are not ready or prepared to deal with the current level of crisis in the community considering how close in timing each event has recently occurred. The staff have been operating in crisis mode all year.”</p>
      <p>He said the community’s registered psychologist feels overwhelmed and cannot proceed without immediate help; their secondary registered therapist is closely related to the latest suicide and may also feel overwhelmed; and the health director has also recently suffered a close loss in her family.</p>
      <p>Chalifoux said he has been in contact with Health Canada and the Saskatchewan Health Authority to coordinate mental health support.</p>
      <p>“We would like each and every school aged child to be assessed with parental permission at our school. We would like our staff to be debriefed, supported through crisis respite,” Chalifoux said.</p>
      <p>The community also wants immediate funding to hire a suicide support coordinator and additional school counsellors throughout the next few months.</p>
