      <h1>Why Tesla's Shares Are Trucking Lower Today</h1>
      <h2>The Cybertruck is definitely different, but is it good?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:28:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/1575/" target="_blank">John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe)</a></address>
      <h3>What happened</h3>
      <p>Shares of <b>Tesla </b>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla/">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>) were trading sharply lower on Friday morning after the Thursday-night reveal of the company's Cybertruck pickup fell short of expectations.</p>
      <p>As of 11:00 a.m. EST, Tesla's shares were down about 6% from Thursday's closing price.</p>
      <h3>So what</h3>
      <p>Investors had expected Tesla's <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/16/what-we-know-about-teslas-pickup-truck.aspx">much-touted pickup truck</a> to be a more-or-less forthright electric challenger to the huge-selling (and hugely profitable) full-size pickups from <b>Ford Motor </b>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f/">NYSE:F</a>), <b>General Motors</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm/">NYSE:GM</a>), and <b>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles </b>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/fiat-chrysler-automobiles/fcau/">NYSE:FCAU</a>).</p>
      <p>But CEO Elon Musk had other plans.</p>

      <p>As you can see, Tesla's Cybertruck is a jarringly angular stainless-steel-bodied behemoth that looks like it escaped from the set of a dystopian sci-fi film. While the claims for range and towing capacity and so forth are impressive -- as one would expect from Tesla -- the design of the Cybertruck and its decidedly oddball features suggest strongly that it will be a niche product at best -- and that much development work remains to be done.</p>
      <p>At least in its current form, it's not a truck for truck buyers. That means it's unlikely to sell in anything like Detroit-pickup volumes, and investors appear to be adjusting their expectations accordingly.</p>
      <h3>Now what</h3>
      <p>Customers can reserve a Cybertruck with a deposit of just $100, a hint that Tesla might be hoping to rack up strong reservation numbers. Good early numbers might impress investors, but take note: Tesla's site warns that the first deliveries won't happen until late 2021 at the earliest, and GM and Ford are both expected to have battery-electric pickups on sale by then.</p>
      <p>It's far too early to even guess how the competition will shape up, but -- at least right now -- <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-car-stocks.aspx">auto investors</a> seem to think that Tesla missed an opportunity.</p>
