      <h1>'Atrocious' trend wedding shamers can't stand - and it cost one bride £775</h1>
      <h2>Earlier this year a number of fashion designers helped launched a new wedding trend, which sees brides forgoing heels and instead wearing a pair of white trainers on their big day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:12:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>Like most things in life, no two <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weddings">weddings</a> are ever the same.</p>
      <p>The happy couple will have poured their own personal style and tastes into the special occasion.</p>
      <p>But over the last few months, thanks to fashion designers such as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/wedding-trainers-now-thing-brides-14163765">Kate Spade</a> and Jimmy Choo releasing bridal trainer collections, a number of women have started wearing very similar shoes on their big day.</p>
      <p>This trend hasn't been received all that well by trolls on wedding shaming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> groups, with one recent bride's choice of footwear being branded "ugly" and "atrocious", according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10392937/bride-wears-designer-trainers-wedding-atrocious/">The Sun.</a></p>

        <figcaption>A bride has come under fire online for wearing these £775 trainers on her wedding day</figcaption>

      <p>A photo of the unnamed bride has been doing the rounds on social media.</p>
      <p>In the picture the woman can be seen wearing a short, feathery <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wedding-outfits">white dress</a> and a pair of white and silver Christian Louboutin sneakers that would have set her back around £775.</p>
      <p>The person who shared the photo in the group clarified that this was the bride's second look on the wedding day and not the one she wore to the ceremony.</p>
      <p>However this information did little to appease people.</p>

      <p>One person commented on the picture, saying: "I met this girl ONCE but she had amazing style and taste. AND THEN SHE WEARS SNEAKERS AT HER WEDDING? WITH A SHORT DRESS. Come on guys."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "They are the ugliest shoes I have ever seen."</p>
      <p>Others were undecided about the ensemble but suggested that the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/shoes">shoes</a> might look better if they had a bit more sparkle on them.</p>
      <p>Not everyone hated the trainers though, with one person saying they "low key love" the bride's look.</p>
