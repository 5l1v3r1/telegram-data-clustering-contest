      <p>Plymouth people have been invited to apply for free therapy from animals, to help research into effective 'alternative' treatments for anxiety and PTSD.</p>
      <p>Dartmoor Zoological Park is seeking participants to take part in a free study into 'animal assisted intervention', often known as 'AAI,' at the zoo in Sparkwell.</p>
      <p>Male and female adult participants will receive a free day out at Dartmoor Zoo, and simply have to answer a questionnaire before and after their day at the zoo, and have saliva samples taken.</p>
      <p>Dartmoor Zoo is looking for 24 participants with PTSD, 24 with anxiety disorder and 24 'who have never been diagnosed with or consider themselves to have any form of mental health condition' to be used as a control group.</p>

      <p>In a letter to the public, lead experimenter, Dennis Morris said: "Dartmoor Zoological Park is seeking participants to take part in an experimental study into: Zoo-based 'animal assisted intervention' (AAI) as an effective complementary or alternative treatment for PTSD and Anxiety."</p>
      <p>"As part of the study participants will receive a free day out at Dartmoor zoo," Dennis added.</p>
      <p>The study is 'likely to be in the New Year,' he told Plymouth Live.</p>
      <p>The zoo is looking for "24 participants with the mental health condition PTSD," and "24 participants with the mental health condition 'anxiety disorder' (various)."</p>
      <p>Researchers are also seeking "24 participants who have never been diagnosed or consider themselves to have any form of mental health condition, to be used [as] a control group."</p>
      <p>Dennis added: "Dartmoor Zoological Park and the University of Plymouth are currently in the process of undertaking a joint, inaugural study into 'Zoo-based animal-assisted intervention (AAI) as a complimentary or alternative treatment for PTSD and anxiety.'</p>
      <p>"This [is] being done for the purpose of trying to make a difference to the lives of those who unfortunately suffer with mental health conditions such as PTSD and anxiety.</p>
      <p>"As such we have just received ethical approval for our study and are now in the process of seeking participants."</p>
      <p>Mr Morris added: "We are seeking to enlist 24 willing participants who suffer with the mental health condition PTSD (12 adult males and 12 adult females), 24 participants who suffer with 'anxiety disorders - various' (12 adult males and 12 adult females) and 24Â  participants who have never been diagnose with or consider themselves to have a mental health condition - to be used as a control group (12 adult males and 12 adult females).</p>

      <p>"The present study involves no deception whatsoever and offers complete transparency (including an end debriefing) to participants, as to its purpose. All potential participants will of course have the right to withdraw from the study (including information/details acquired) at any time.</p>
      <p>"All personal information and details, answers to questionnaires and biological samples (salivary cortisol samples will be taken from participants as part of this study) will remain strictly confidential at all times, will be shared with no other outside establishments/affiliations, and will be destroyed once the study is complete."</p>
      <p>Participants will be required to 'take and store salivary swabs three times a day, for two days prior to their visit to Dartmoor Zoo' once during the morning, at mid-day and in the evening, and 'three times during the day of the zoo visit, and three times a day for two days after their visit to Dartmoor Zoo,' once during the morning, at mid-day and in the evening.</p>
      <p>Dennis told Plymouth Live that the reason they will take saliva samples is because they can monitor the 'stress hormone in saliva' and salivary samples are 'less invasive than hair or blood samples'.</p>
      <p>Participants will also be required to answer a questionnaire prior to entering the zoo for their free tour, and again once their tour is finished.</p>
      <p>All answers and information collected will be kept strictly private and confidential and used only for the purposes of the study.</p>
