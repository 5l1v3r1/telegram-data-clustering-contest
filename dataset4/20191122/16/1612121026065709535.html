      <p>Do you remember when mobile phones were actually used for making calls and sending texts, instead of checking emails, posting to Facebook and Instagram, managing your finances, replacing your dedicated point-and-shoot camera, usurping the role of the walkman, and even taking the place of your wallet? Well, OnePlus has come up with a list of things that we used to do back in the year 2000 compared to what we now do on smartphones such as the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/phone/oneplus-7t/">OnePlus 7T</a> in 2019.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What we did in 2000 compared to 2019</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>In 2000 we played snake….in 2019 we play the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346224-oneplus-7t-pro-phone-piano/">piano</a> on the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345138-oneplus-7t-pro-announcement/">OnePlus 7T Pro</a></li>
        <li>In 2000 we Blackberry messaged….in 2019 we say what’s up on WhatsApp</li>
        <li>In 2000 we called a premium rate number to get a ringtone such as Ms. Jackson, in 2019 our phone is on perma-mute</li>
        <li>In 2000 we used to stay in contact with SMS….in 2019 the only people who send SMS are Dominos (but who can resist 50% off?)</li>
        <li>In 2000 our mobile phone batteries lasted around three days….in 2019, we’re shouting across the office “who’s got a charger I can borrow?”</li>
        <li>In 2000 we’d punch in our friend’s numbers from memory…in 2019, we have absolutely no idea what our own number actually is, nevermind anyone else’s</li>
        <li>In 2000 we had to use a digital camera to take a picture, as camera phones didn’t exist… in 2019 digital what! Camera phone cameras are so advanced, there’s no need for a traditional camera of a lower resolution</li>
        <li>In 2000 apps meant a university or job application… in 2019 the app market is worth an estimated $71.3 billion</li>
        <li>In the early 2000’s we used to upload our photos from a digital camera onto MySpace…in 2019 we let everyone know what we’re up to by posting our best photos on Instagram</li>
        <li>In 2000 we walked around with a mobile phone and a Diskman…in 2019 we stream til’ our heart’s content on a smartphone with Spotify or YouTube Music</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let us know in the comments below how the advancement of the smartphone has changed your life since the year 2000.</p>
