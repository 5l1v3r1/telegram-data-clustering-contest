      <h1>Harry Styles Reveals That He Waited Until The End Of One Direction To Experiment With Drugs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:17:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Kerr</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/harry-styles-just-released-a-new-song-and-fans-are-losing-their-minds-over-the-steamy-music-video-did-he-just-come-out-as-bisexual-329337/">Harry Styles</a> became famous pretty much overnight back in 2010 when he was just 16 years old after he auditioned for the UK version of the <i>X-Factor</i> as a solo artist. Simon Cowell decided to create One Direction, which featured Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, and they immediately became one of the most popular musical groups on the planet. Now that the members of the group have gone their separate ways, Styles says that he didn’t want to be the one to mess things up for everyone, so he waited until the group broke up before he experimented with drugs.</p>
      <p>Styles recently told Zane Lowe: “’When I was in the band, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us I felt , I’m not going to be the one who f**** it up. So I was like, now is the time in my life when you probably go out and experiment.”</p>

      <p>During his time in One Direction, Styles says that there were plenty of opportunities to “take this” and “do that” with friends. But, he decided that he wouldn’t touch anything.</p>
      <p>For five years the group recorded albums and toured all over the world, and Styles didn’t want to do anything that could jeopardize their success. But, after Malik left the group in 2015, they took an indefinite hiatus the following year. And now that Styles is doing his own thing, the 25-year-old has taken the opportunity to explore his own consciousness with magic mushrooms.</p>

      <p>While recording his new album at Shangri-La studios in Malibu, Style said he experimented with the natural hallucinogen, but he felt safe doing it. Styles says that making his new record made him feel more joyous and he was with friends, and now is the time to have fun.</p>
      <p>Styles now looks back on the time he spent recording his new album <i>Fine Line</i> with fond memories, even though there was some blood involved. The singer admits that after doing mushrooms he went to record a song, but he ended up biting off the tip of his tongue and tried to sing with blood gushing out of his mouth.</p>
      <p>Harry Styles’ sophomore album <i>Fine Line</i> drops on December 13th, and fans can already listen to the first two singles <i>Watermelon Sugar</i> and <i>Lights Up</i>.</p>
