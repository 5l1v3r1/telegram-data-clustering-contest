        <b>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed midfielder Scott McTominay will be missing for ‘a couple of weeks’ after the Scotland international was stretchered off in the Red Devils’ Premier League win over Brighton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was an outside chance that he may have recovered from the problem over the international break, but it has now emerged that he will be forced to sit on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Solskjaer confirmed McTominay’s absence and provided an injury update on the rest of his squad, including Paul Pogba .</p>
      <p>“Scotty hurt his ankle and so he will be out for a couple of weeks,” the Norwegian said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve lost [Marcos] Rojo, he’s injured. Paul [Pogba] is still injured, but we’ve got Axel [Tuanzebe], Luke [Shaw] and Nemanja [Matic] back in training so we’re looking better, we’re getting numbers back.</p>
      <p>“Tim [Fosu-Mensah] and Eric [Bailly] have had knee injuries and been out for a long time but they have stepped up their recovery. They have not joined with team but they are not far away.</p>
      <p>“Rojo got a muscle injury in training that he’s been struggling with, he’s not ready yet. He was playing on with some discomfort towards the end of that run so maybe a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>“[Pogba] had another test and scan just at the start of the international break and it’s not healed yet. He is stepping up the recovery so he doesn’t have to have the cast on.</p>
      <p>“He’s out for six or seven weeks and you do lose loads of muscle, so he’s gradually stepping up walking on the treadmill and biking. It’ll still be a few weeks, we hope to see him in 2019.</p>
      <p>“We’ve lost Nemanja for a long period [as well and] that’s gonna take it’s toll if you take three midfielders out of any top club, but Fred’s stepped up and we’ll have to try to conjure up a way of replacing them.</p>
      <p>“Long-term we’re looking at different positions and midfield is one we’ve been looking at. There’s always types of players we’re looking at but I’m not going to talk about that now.”</p>
