      <h1>Murdered former BBC TV announcer Mike Kerr 'victim of vicious, sustained beating'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:02:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">David Young, Press Association</a></address>
      <p>A former TV announcer found murdered in his home was the victim of a vicious and sustained attack, a senior detective has said.</p>
      <p>The body of widower Mike Kerr (68)Â was discovered on Tuesday afternoon by neighbours who became suspicious when he had not taken in the bins from outside his Bangor home.</p>
      <p>Police have not yet established a motive but have said it was unlikely to have had a sexual motive or involved paramilitaries.</p>
      <p>Detectives believe Mr Kerr, who worked as a TV and radio announcer for BBC NI in the 1970s and 1980s, either disturbed intruders inside his Birch Drive home or was the victim of a personal vendetta.</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, head of the PSNI's major investigation team, provided an update in the murder probe on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Mike was the victim of a vicious, sustained and violent beating which resulted in his death," he said.</p>
      <p>"He suffered skull and facial fractures as a result. Mike's body showed no sign of defensive injuries and he is likely to have been utterly defenceless in the face of the violence he faced."</p>
      <p>Police believe at least one weapon was used to inflict the multiple blunt trauma wounds Mr Kerr sustained.</p>
      <p>"Mike was a widower, having lost his wife around 15 years ago," said Mr Murphy.</p>
      <p>"His brother, sister, niece and nephew are this morning coming to terms with Mike's brutal murder. Our thoughts are with the family and we will continue to support them throughout the investigation."</p>
      <p>Mr Murphy said there was no evidence of a forced entry at the house or a chaotic search that would suggest his home had been ransacked by burglars.</p>
      <p>But he said police were still working to establish whether anything had been stolen.</p>
      <p>The senior detective appealed for public help to find the killer or killers.</p>
      <p>They said whoever was responsible was likely to have left the property with blood-stained clothing.</p>
      <p>"I believe that answers to Mike's murder lie within the community and I am appealing for the public's help in identifying those responsible for this vicious attack," he said.</p>
