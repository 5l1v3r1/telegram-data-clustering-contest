      <p>“Filipinos are among the most avid TV watchers in the world. They gather around TV sets whenever big events are being showed, and the SEA Games are one of the biggest events of the year," said Martin Han, General Manager of coocaa Philippines Branch. "This partnership gives us a chance to connect more intimately with the many young Filipino consumers, and we are eagerly looking forward to take part in it." The SEA Games is a biennial multi-sport event involving participants from the current 11 countries of Southeast Asia. Hosted by the Philippines this year, the event is expected to reach television audiences of 500 million and online users of 60 million.  Established in Shenzen, China in 2006, coocaa debuted in the Philippines earlier this year to satisfy the technology and entertainment cravings of young Filipinos. With its intelligent technology, sleek designs, and affordable prices, coocaa is the first and only TV brand to consistently be listed among the bestselling home appliance brands on Lazada since it entered the Philippine market.  This strategic partnership allows the young and energetic TV brand to capitalize on the tremendous reach and popularity of the SEA Games. With their slogan "PLAY IN YOUR STYLE", coocaa and the Southeast Asian Games make a perfect combination to showcase the strength and vitality of the people of the Philippines and the region.  In support of the 2019 SEA Games, coocaa is launching several promo campaigns to hype Filipino sports fans. Additionally, the TV brand developed the "I am a torchbearer" game where people have the opportunity to support and cheer for the Philippines in the games, and get a chance to win big prizes such as coocaa TVs, discount vouchers, SEA Games opening tickets, and many more. “We want to bring people closer to the action. By virtue of an online game, we want to encourage Filipino fans to support the Philippines and be active participants in the 2019 SEA Games. At the same time, we're giving participants some of the biggest discounts ever during the games. Through this, we hope to bring technology, entertainment, and cost-effective internet TV to more people in the Philippines and around Southeast Asia as well," said Martin Han.
