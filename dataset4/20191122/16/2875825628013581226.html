      <p>Katie Price has ripped into Emily Atack in a furious <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> rant.</p>
      <p>Katie posted a video laying into Emily, who had joked that Katie had STI's, indicating that she had a smelly vagina.</p>
      <p>She also dropped a big hint that she was heading into the jungle to confront Emily directly on Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>"So Emily Atack you think it's clever do you to slag me off? Who are you anyway?", she asked.</p>
      <p>"Looks like i'm coming for you", she added, gesturing to her rucksack.</p>
      <p>"Because if you've got something to say don't say it behind my back on telly say it to me.</p>

      <p>"Because all the men you've been with don't have good things to say about you."</p>
      <p>Wafting her hand under her nose she exclaimed: "Phwoar, fishy!"</p>
      <p>Furious Katie previously demanded Emily's number after the former Inbetweeners star quipped about the pool Katie and Peter Andre frolicked in during their I'm A Celebrity stint in 2004.</p>

      <p>Emily weighed in after her co-hosts Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas were filmed splashing around in the creek where Katie and Peter had canoodled 15 years previously.</p>
      <p>"I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool," Emily joked on camera as she pulled a face.</p>
      <p>But the quip didn't land well back at home, as Katie was reportedly fuming when she heard about Emily's comments from friends.</p>

      <p>"Loads of fans were messaging her on social media too â€“ and Katie was furious," a source told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10378563/katie-price-threatens-australia-extra-camp-stds/">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"She was telling people that she can't believe Emily would say something so snide and if she 'wants a problem, I'll give her a problem'."</p>
      <p>The insider added: "At one point Katie was saying she'd fly out to Australia and confront her. She's not going to, obviously, but she was asking around to see if anyone had Emily's number.</p>
