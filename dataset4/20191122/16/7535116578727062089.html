      <p>KLâ€™s back alleys have long been a hive of activity â€“ from wet markets to hidden food courts and other unique hallmarks, the modernisation of the city has seen use lose a little bit of this culture. However, thanks to Think City, the city-making organisation behind the revitalisation of George Town, KLâ€™s famous <b>Madras Lane is about to get a new lease on life thanks to LorongFest</b>!</p>
      <p>This festival will transform the iconic Madras Lane wet market and open-air car park into a space to celebrate arts and culture â€“ along with callbacks to the famous Madras Theatre, where KL-ites used to go to watch Chinese action moves and old westerns in the 60â€™s and 70â€™s before the theatre burned down in 1979.</p>
