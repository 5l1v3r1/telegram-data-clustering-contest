      <p>Because the 3D printing community is still small, it requires companies with dedication and a real passion for helping it thrive. Matterhackers has been a part of that community for a long time now, offering manufacturers a way to sell their products to a broad audience. Matterhackers even make their brand of printer, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/matterhackers-pulse-xe-3d-printer-review-all-tough-jobs">the Pulse</a> while offering a vast range of printers, upgrade components, and materials, for you to buy.</p>
      <p>This week Matterhackers has been offering sale offers leading up to today, Friday, November 22, 2019, where it has unleashed its biggest sale of the year, Blue Friday. The sale has massive discounts on over a thousand products, and we are going to highlight some of my favorite in this article. Just remember to use the code <b>BLUFRI</b> at checkout to apply the savings.</p>

      <p>The LulzBot Mini 2 has been a favorite of mine for a long time. The build plate isn't huge, but the quality of the prints is fantastic. There are also a lot of different tool heads that you can swap out to get different results depending on your goal. With a saving of $225 and free shipping, you are going to love this beauty.</p>

      <p>I use the PrintDry every single day to keep my filament dry. The secret of this PrintDry is the inner spindle and the small holes that allow you to dry your filament and print at the same time. Not only is this convenient, but it also makes sure you get the best results every time.</p>

      <p>The Pulse XE was a great printer when it was $1,200, a fantastic printer when they dropped the price to $1,000, and an absolute steal at $900. The XE is specifically built to print all those exotic filaments you have wanted to use. Nylon X, Glow-in-the-dark, RYNO, and just about anything else you can think of, will print effortlessly on the Pulse XE.</p>

      <p>Resin printing is becoming extremely popular, powered by companies offering affordable, high-quality printers. Companies like Peopoly are offering people a way into it for a reasonable price. With a considerable saving of $260, there isn't a better time to pick one of these Moai kits up. You'll be glad you did.</p>

      <p>Magigoo is brilliant. It uses science and magic to help you hold your print firmly to the print bed while printing. Then, when it's finished printing, the model just pops off with no fuss. I use it on all my FDM printers, and it works like a charm. One tube will last you over 100 prints, too, and the ten percent saving is just icing on the cake.</p>

      <p>Build series PLA is the workhorse of filaments. The prints I've printed with it have turned out smooth, and the filament is designed to be post-processed. It sands nice and evenly, and gives a high finish once you spent some time with it. With a whopping 25 percent off the bundles, you will be buying filament at the equivalent of just $14.99 a roll. That's pretty amazing.</p>

      <h3>That's just the tip of the iceberg</h3>
      <p>These are just some of my favorite things; it's not even close to the complete list of sale items. I didn't even mention the massive $980 saving you can get on the <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/lulzbot-taz-pro-industrial-3d-printer/sk/MSNN7UCE?aff=7455">LulzBot Taz Pro</a> or the $400 off of the <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/flashforge-dreamer-dual-extrusion-3d-printer/sk/M9YF6TPN?aff=7455">FlashForge Dreamer Dual Extrusion</a> because there isn't room to fit all the deals in one post. Suffice to say; if you are looking for a deal on 3D printing, this is the place to be today.</p>
      <p>Remember, not only are Matterhackers offering these deals by adding the code <b>BLUFRI</b> at checkout, but it has also recently announced it's best price guarantee. So if you can find the product you want anywhere else in the US, they will match that price (barring a few products) and ship it to you with free shipping in the US. It's a great deal and makes Matterhackers my go-to company from now on.</p>
