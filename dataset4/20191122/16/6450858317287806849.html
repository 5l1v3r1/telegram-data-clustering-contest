      <p>Olaf recaps the events of the movie (this recalls a scene earlier in the film where he recaps the first movie). He says that his theory that “water has memory” was correct. The camera then cuts to his audience which includes the snow monster from the first Frozen film and hundreds of baby snowmen.</p>
