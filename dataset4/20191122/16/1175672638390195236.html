        <b>Tangente by Nomos</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nomos Glashütte has updated its Tangente watch, 25 years after it was released. The hand-wound watch has a midnight-blue dial, complemented by velour leather straps and a sapphire-crystal glass case.</p>
      <p>The timepiece comes in two sizes that have slightly different accents. Gold type and dials offset the blue hue in the smaller version, which has a 35 millimetre diameter. The other watch face measures 38 millimetres and has silver details.</p>

      <p>With this year marking the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus school, it would be apt to gift the mini Bauhaus-building models by Chisel &amp; Mouse.</p>
      <p>The miniatures detail different elements of the Bauhaus Dessau building in Germany, which was designed by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/walter-gropius/">Walter Gropius</a> and was home to the influential design school from 1925 to 1932. Options include a seven-inch-tall plaster model of the stair block, complete with the raised signage and gridded windows, and the entrance steps, with red doorways and canopy.</p>
