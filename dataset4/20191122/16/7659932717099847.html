      <p>A Palestinian wounded in an Israeli strike that killed eight members of his family has died, the health ministry in the Hamas-run strip said on Friday.<br/><br/>Mohammed Abu Malhous al-Sawarka, 40, succumbed after being wounded in "the massacre in which eight members of a family died when they were targeted in their homes," ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said in a statement.<br/><br/>It said he was the brother of Rasmi Abu Malhous who was killed when his home was hit by an airstrike on November 14.<br/><br/>Five children and Rasmi's two wives were also killed.<br/><br/>Israel has pledged to investigate the incident, saying that their intelligence reports had indicated "no civilians were expected to be harmed".<br/><br/>Israel described Rasmi as an Islamic Jihad commander, but Gaza residents have suggested it may have been a case of mistaken identity.<br/><br/>The three-day flareup began when Israel killed a senior Islamic Jihad official in Gaza on November 12.<br/><br/>The group, which is closely allied with Gaza's rulers Hamas, subsequently fired more than 450 rockets at Israel.<br/><br/>During the confrontation Israeli forces attacked dozens of targets in the enclave.<br/><br/>Palestinian officials said 35 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 wounded. There were no Israeli fatalities.</p>
