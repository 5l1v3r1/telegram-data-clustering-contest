      <h1>Why The Crown's representation of Wales means so much to me</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:01:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/georgegriffiths/" target="_blank">George Griffiths</a></address>
      <p>During the sixth episode of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-crown/">The Crown</a>’s third season, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a> (Josh O’Connor) is studying for a term at Aberystwyth University, trying to learn Welsh for his investiture as the Prince of Wales.</p>
      <p>His teacher is a staunch Welsh nationalist and deputy leader of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party. Probably not the best person to speak to when Charles makes this statement: ‘Wales is Britain. Britain is Wales.’</p>
      <p>And that is, really, what most people think. Of all the countries that make up the United Kingdom, Wales is the only one, you could argue, without a solid national identity of its own. It has coal. Catherine Zeta-Jones. Nessa from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gavin-and-stacey/">Gavin and Stacey</a>.</p>
      <p>I’ve always seen this as a problem whenever I see depictions of my native country on the screen. They don’t really scratch the surface. The people are working class. The rollings hills and valleys are sheltered in rain and fog. There’s no real dissection, really, about what it means to be Welsh or live in Wales.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>I expected the third season of The Crown to be much the same. Although, to my great surprise, it wasn’t. In fact, I’d go so far as to say it was one of the best, most accurate representations of Wales and the Welsh I’ve ever seen on screen. And it meant so, so much to me.</p>
      <p>The first big visit to Wales occurs in the third episode of the third season – which deals entirely with the disaster in the village of Aberfan in Merthyr Tydfil in 1966. It is one of the darkest chapters in modern Welsh history, and a tragedy that most people probably never even knew about.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t even the programme’s depictions of the horrible events – in an almost <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/07/chernobyl-tv-watch-9428565/">Chenobyl</a>-esque effect – that got to me the most. It was the time we actually spent in the village of Aberfan and the little snippets of Welsh life. If there’s one thing that I can safely say, growing up in the Welsh valleys, is that your entire life revolves around family, since every living member of your family probably lives within a five minute walk from you.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/olivia-colman/">Olivia Colman</a>’s Queen Elizabeth II finally prepares to make a visit to the devastated Welsh village, she is advised by those closest to her to not bury her emotions, but show them openly.</p>
      <p>She is told that she is not in England anymore, she is in Wales. And I can’t sum it up any better myself. This is a place – the predominantly working-class areas of the South Wales valleys especially – that is ruled by emotions, by openness and honesty. Not a place for a stiff upper lip and a keep calm and carry on attitude.</p>

      <p>There were little touches as well that warmed my heart at points. Just the littlest touch, really, but hearing Welsh children call their mothers ‘mam’ instead of ‘mum’ genuinely brought a smile to my face.</p>

      <p>In most other dramas either set in or connected to Wales – like The Accident, the neo-noir Requiem or even the film Pride – this is one specificity that is genuinely overlooked and I don’t know why. If I went up to my mam and started calling her mum, I think she’d look at me like I’d suddenly grown two heads.</p>
      <p>Even the Prince Charles-centric episode set in Aberystwyth kept these little flourishes in, even though I am loath to say that not many Welsh people actually speak Welsh and probably had no more idea what the Prince of Wales was saying than the Queen herself. Apologies to my Welsh language GCSE teacher – it’s a hard language to learn!</p>
      <p>But my happiness is also bolstered because this kind of Welsh representation didn’t happen on some homegrown BBC Wales drama sent out at 8pm on a Tuesday night, it was broadcast on The Crown. The Crown! Arguably the jewel in Netflix’s original programming crown, an opulent, luxurious period drama adored and seen by people the world over.</p>
      <p>This is why this matters. I know most people won’t care – or even notice – what Welsh children call their mother, but I do. I care that now a global audience of millions upon millions of people have gained a greater insight into Wales than they ever have before.</p>

      <p>Even if the only thing they take away from the new season is the true, tragic story of Aberfan and the plight of the people in that poor village, I’m happy. Because now they know that Welsh stories exist. They happen. They are happening right now.</p>
      <p>If anything, Wales will only get more important to The Crown as the series heads further forwards in time. The fourth season of the show is currently filming, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/the-crown-boss-teases-paradigm-shift-arrival-of-gillian-andersons-margaret-thatcher-in-season-4-11195670/">with Gillian Anderson portraying Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</a>. The Miner’s Strikes of 1984-1985 are one of the most, if not the most, defining moments in modern Welsh history. They decimated working class communities like my own and still have lasting impact to this day on unemployment and job creation.</p>
      <p>And do you know what? I’m excited again. Excited for people to get another glimpse into Welsh history. Another opportunity to learn something about the history of a country that is often overlooked or not thought about at all.</p>
