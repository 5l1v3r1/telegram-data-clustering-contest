      <h1>This Is An Ad, Within An Ad, Within An Ad, And It’s Absolutely Brilliant</h1>

        <b>A gin brand, a TV, and a new movie: Ryan Reynolds advertises all of it with an ad, within an ad, within an ad. Finding it hard to follow? Just watch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ryan Reynold is not just a great actor; he is a successful businessman and one heck of an advertiser too. Do you remember his <a href="https://wersm.com/ryan-reynolds-has-a-special-marketing-skill-snarky-ooo-emails/">OOO email campaign for Aviation Gin</a>? Well, he is back, and this time the situation is very meta.</p>
      <p>In his new ad, Reynolds pitches a Samsung TV as the best TV to watch his upcoming Netflix movie ‘6 Underground’. This makes perfect sense and showcases a real case of smart brand collaboration.</p>
      <p>But there’s a catch. Reynolds also bought ‘a mid-roll ad’ for his own Aviation Gin brand. The result? An ad, within an ad, within an ad. And it’s absolutely brilliant! All this, in under a minute!</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8106534/">‘6 Underground’</a> is directed by Michael Bay and hits <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> on December 13th.</p>
