      <p>President Trump made a surprise visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Thursday evening with the first lady and conservative actor Jon Voight by his side.</p>
      <p>Photos from the president's visit to the base show Trump saluting the flag-draped caskets of David Knadle, 33, from Texas, and Kirk Fuchigami Jr., 35. The two were helicopter pilots killed during a crash in Afghanistan this week.</p>
      <p>The Army says it is investigating the incident that led to the two soldiers' death.</p>
      <p>Voight was at the White House on Thursday to participate in the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Trump's most recent trip to Dover was in January when he paid tribute to four Americans killed in a suicide bomb attack in Syria, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-makes-unscheduled-visit-to-dover-to-receive-remains-of-two-fallen-soldiers/2019/11/21/31625c14-0cb3-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">according to the <i>Washington Post</i>.</a></p>
      <p>Trump has often spoken of the grief of gold star families, and describes consoling them as "one of the toughest parts of my job."</p>
      <p>Voight told the <i>Post</i> that Trump invited him to come to Dover.</p>
