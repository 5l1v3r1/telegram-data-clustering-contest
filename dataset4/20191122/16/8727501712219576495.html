        <b>We might have another week to go until December but we reckon it’s just about acceptable to be getting into the festive spirit. And there are loads of opportunities to do so this Saturday: at a Scandinavian Christmas market in Rotherhithe, on Camden Market’s new ice rink, which opened this week, and sipping a Christmassy cocktail or two at Barking’s Laser Light Synth display.</b>
