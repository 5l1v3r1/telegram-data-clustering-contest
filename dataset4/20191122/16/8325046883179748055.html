      <p>A nice candle is always a welcomed gift. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;amp;mid=42352&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopbop.com%2Flafco-new-york%2Fbr%2Fv%3D1%2F49383.htm">These ones</a> are made to embody the scents of common places, including rooms in the house. The best part of these candles, though, is that they’ll be able to reuse the hand-blown glass vessel once the candle has burned down. All they have to do is put it in the freezer when the wax runs down, pop it out with a knife, and run it through the dishwasher. Our editor uses hers for everything from cotton swabs to serving snacks.</p>
