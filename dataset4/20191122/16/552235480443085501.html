      <h2>Audi offers a range of high-class vehicles to choose from in the shape of the A5, A6 and A7. This feature checks out the specs and prices of a number of variants.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:31:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Giles Blair, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/giles-blair/</a></address>
      <p>UPMARKET German car maker Audi now offers a range of executive expresses to suit the needs and budgets of most individuals or fleet managers.</p>
      <p>These include the A5 and A7 Sportback models, with the classy A6 saloon and estate sandwiched in between. The A5 Sportback boasts the practicality of four doors and a hatchback boot with the sleek styling of a coupe.</p>
      <p>It is also available loaded with lots of clever technology from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/audi">the four rings brand</a> and a choice of powerful and refined diesel and petrol engines mated to either a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic gearbox.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Every version comes with either xenon or LED headlights, leather trim with heated front seats, sat nav and seven-inch touchscreen, front and rear parking sensors, powered tailgate and a city safety system that brakes to prevent a collision.</p>
      <p>Many buyers will be tempted to add the sophisticated options such as the virtual cockpit that puts a big colour screen in place of the conventional instruments, which is brilliant for displaying the sat nav, and the head-up display.</p>
      <p>The A5 has great road manners, with an appropriate hint of sporty firmness but the ability to absorb the worst bumps. It pulls along smoothly and is ideal for the kind of long-distance driving done by many business users.</p>

      <p>Featuring Audi’s trademark solid build quality, the cabin is surprisingly roomy – with enough leg and headroom for even a couple of six-footers in the rear, despite the sloping roofline. Continuing the practical theme, the A5’s boot is huge and easily expanded by folding the rear seatback.</p>
      <p>With prices starting from £34,790 for a Sport model, it certainly has a lot going for it – although many will be tempted to go for the S line trim, priced from £36,560, which has racier looks.</p>
      <p>The A6 saloon and Avant estate, in particular, make a great alternative to the plethora of SUVs on our roads and offer mild hybrid powertrains – with a plug-in saloon variant due to take to the streets early next year.</p>

      <p>The choice of pulling power runs to both petrol and diesel units, with power ranging from 204 to a potent 340PS, making use of either seven or eight-speed automatic transmissions that are velvet smooth.</p>
      <p>Depending on the trim chosen, you can select from standard, sport or adaptive air suspension systems and intelligent quattro four-wheel drive is also available.</p>

      <p>Much of the tech and goodies on board the A6 is taken from the flagship A8. Even the base model features LED lights, leather upholstery and twin touchscreens.</p>
      <p>But what is as impressive is the amount of space on board, particularly for those in the back. And the Avant’s loadbed is easy to use as well as cavernous, while the long cover will hide the cargo from prying eyes.</p>
      <p>Despite the considerable size of the A6, the car rides well and has a refreshing lightness to its handling, while all the variants provide enough urge for safe overtaking. The A6 is competitively priced, too, with the entry-level Sport saloon available from £39,375 and the equivalent Avant priced at £41,475.</p>

      <p>And if you need something that is more capable of tackling rougher conditions, in the way an SUV can, you’ll want to check out the A6 allroad quattro estate, which is available from £54,555.</p>
      <p>If you really want to make a statement and let people know that you’ve arrived, then Audi’s super-sleek A7 Sportback is the car for you. Packed with sophistication, the latest A7 includes a mild hybrid powertrain for added economy, a new hi-tech interior and even the option of all-wheel steering.</p>
      <p>Audi’s king-sized four-door coupe features striking lines on the bonnet, subtle cuts to the sides and distinctive light arrays front and rear. Launched last year, the latest version has more room than before, particularly in the back, and the luggage space is boosted to 535 litres.</p>

      <p>Comfort levels are of the highest order, while the cockpit has been almost completely digitised – the only switches on the dash are the starter, volume control and parking aid buttons.</p>
      <p>Everything else is operated from the two centre console touchscreens that are complemented by the virtual cockpit multi-mode instrument panel that is standard fit on the A7. Other smart tech includes a semi-autonomous cruise control that can look after the car in stop/start traffic.</p>
      <p>There is one petrol and four diesel units to choose from, with power ranging from 204 to 286PS, using seven or eight-speed auto boxes and with four-wheel drive widely available.</p>

      <p>Regardless of engine choice, the cabin is quite serene under all circumstances and at night the interior is set off with ambient light strips with a selection of 30 colours available.</p>
      <p>The style and refinement combine to ensure the A7 experience is out of the top drawer. And you can enjoy this high-end executive motoring for yourself at prices starting from just £48,175.</p>
