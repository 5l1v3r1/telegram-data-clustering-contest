      <p>The new series of I'm A Celebrity is now well underway, with an eclectic mix of famous faces adjusting to jungle life.</p>
      <p>And among them is Myles Stephenson, who has joined the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Nadine Coyle and Ian Wright for the latest run of the hit ITV show.</p>
      <p>So far, he's been rather quiet in camp but that will all change on Friday night when we see him take part in a Bushtucker Trial alongside Jacqueline Jossa, called Snake Hotel.</p>
      <p>Bookies are tipping Myles to do rather well on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> , with him, middle of the pack to win and not tipped to get an early exit.</p>
      <p>But who is he?</p>
      <h3>Who is Myles on I'm A Celebrity?</h3>
      <p>He is an X Factor winner nonetheless, having triumphed in 2017 with his group Rak-Su. The London lads shot straight to the upper reaches of the iTunes chart with their winners' single Dimelo and also tasted download success with other originals like Mona Lisa and Mamacita.</p>
      <p>Once he comes out of the jungle, Myles, 28, can look forward to Rak-Su's new nationwide tour which has just been announced.</p>

      <p>In his personal life, Myles ex-girlfriend is Gaby Allen from Love Island 2017 who, rather awkwardly was linked to Jacqueline Jossa's other half Dan Osborne - wonder if that crops up in conversation in the jungle?!</p>
