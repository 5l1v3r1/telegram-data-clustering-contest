      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Do you want to see Khadijah James, Synclaire James-Jones, Maxine "Max" Shaw, and Regine Hunter back on the small screen? The characters from the popular 1990s sitcom <i>Living Single</i> could be getting the reboot treatment.</p>
      <p>Veteran entertainer Kim Fields played the fashion-focused Regine on the Fox series. Fields stopped by <i>The</i> <i>Tamron Hall Show</i> for the program's “Throwback Week" and she was questioned about a possible new version of <i>Living Single</i>.</p>
      <p>"We have talked about it a little bit - the six of us and [<i>Living Single</i> creator] Yvette [Lee Bowser]. A lot of it deals with our schedule, because, praise God, everyone is working, everybody is busy, everybody’s got stuff to do," responded the <i>You Light Up My Christmas </i>actress.</p>
      <p>She added, "When Yvette asked, I said I would definitely be interested in seeing what that conversation is and being able to do it. But here's the thing, with reboots you got to be careful because these characters are beloved and those storylines really meant something and they still resonate now. So don't mess around, you got to get it right."</p>
      <p>Besides Fields, <i>Living Single </i>also starred<i> </i>Queen Latifah as Khadijah, Kim Coles as Synclaire, and Erika Alexander as Maxine. John Henton and T.C. Carson played the neighbors/love interests Overton "Obie" Wakefield Jones and Kyle Barker, respectively.</p>
