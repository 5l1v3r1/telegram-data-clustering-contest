      <p>The court heard she had previously been with murder accused Craig Corrall for eight years.</p>
      <p>Miss Kinnaird believed Corrall discovered she had been seeing Mr Hassan – leading to her blocking his number following a string of text messages.</p>
      <p>The 28 year-old was giving evidence at the High Court in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Corrall, 39, and David Callaghan, 30, deny murdering Mr Hassan in Glasgow's Pollokshaws in November last year.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard Miss Kinnaird had been in contact with Mr Hassan shortly before he died.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Lynsey MacDonald asked her: “Did you have some kind of relationship?”</p>
      <p>Miss Kinnaird – who currently lives in Australia – replied: “Previous to me leaving, yes.”</p>

      <p>She said this was from between March and mid-June last year.</p>
      <p>Miss Kinnaird was then asked if she knew Corrall.</p>
      <p>She replied: “He is my ex-boyfriend. We separated January 2018 and had been with him for eight years.”</p>
      <p>She said Corrall remained in contact with her - “giving abuse” and “saying negative things” towards her.</p>
      <p>Miss MacDonald said: “Did it become apparent that Mr Corrall knew about your relationship with Mr Hassan?”</p>
      <p>Miss Kinnaird replied: “At the beginning, no, but then I received messages from Craig that he knew.”</p>
      <p>She described the messages as being “sarcastic”. Texts included reference to “him”.</p>
      <p>Miss MacDonald said: “Who did you understand the 'him' referred to?”</p>
      <p>The witness replied: “It could only be in relation to Owen. I don't know who else he could be referring to.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hassan died on November 7 last year after being found injured outside the Old Stag Inn bar run by his mum Ann Marie Lynch.</p>
      <p>Miss Kinnaird said she found out about the death the next morning. The court heard the pair had been in touch the day before the alleged murder.</p>
      <p>Miss Kinnaird added: “I was leaving on the Sunday, so we were just going to catch up before I left. I did not know the exact plans.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim Mr Hassan was chased, seized by the body and the repeatedly struck with knives or machetes.</p>
      <p>The trial before Lord Woolman continues.</p>
