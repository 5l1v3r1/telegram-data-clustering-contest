      <p>The federal government plans to build a new seaport in the Pessu area of Warri in Delta State at the cost of $800 million, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This revelation came from the Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi on Thursday at the Petroleum Training Institute Conference Centre, in Uvwie council area of Delta state.</p>
      <p>Amaechi was in Delta State to give starter packs, micro-enterprise enhancement loans and resettlement packages to 1,700 women and youths under the National Directorate of Employment empowerment programme.</p>
      <p>“We are building a brand new Sea Port in Pessu. It will cost 800 million dollars. When you stop them from working you are losing such a huge investment where the entire community can be contractors, some can supply sand,” the former Rivers State leader said.</p>
      <p>“There is also the Bonny sea Port that is coming. The best thing to do is to allow the development.</p>
      <p>“Imagine the companies that have left Warri, let the Sea Port project go on smoothly.”</p>
