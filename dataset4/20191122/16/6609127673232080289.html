      <p>And her US state department colleague David Holmes – who also gave evidence - completed a degree in international affairs in 2002.</p>
      <p>The diplomats were widely-praised online for the way they performed in front of the house intelligence committee on Thursday - with many describing Dr Hill has a ‘hero’.</p>
      <p>A uni spokeswoman said: “Fiona and David are part of long tradition of diplomats, politicians and experts in international relations to have studied here in St Andrews.</p>
      <p>“We were extremely proud to watch them speaking truth to power in the clear and confident style which is a hallmark of their professionalism and service.”</p>
      <p>Dr Hill – an English-born Russia expert, from County Durham - told of her fears the US was ‘running out of time’ to prevent Vladimir Putin and his intelligence forces from repeating their assault on next year’s US elections.</p>
      <p>She delivered the warning after having rubbished President Trump’s repeated claim that Russia’s interference in his 2016 victory was a “hoax”.</p>

      <p>The 54-year-old – now a US citizen – said: “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”</p>
      <p>She told the committee: “Right now, Russia’s security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>“We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”</p>
      <p>The straight-talking Geordie’s testimony - broadcast live around the globe – went down a storm with punters impressed by her performance.</p>

      <p>Twitter user Samantha Waterman oozed: “Fiona Hill is my hero. Absolutely phenomenal, in every way.”</p>
      <p>Jim Seven said: “Fiona Hill is impressively intelligent. Too bad she can’t be president. The contrast between her and Trump is stunning.”</p>
      <p>Frank Stanton agreed, posting: “This person is becoming a hero by virtue of telling the truth, with an edge in her voice. Right on.”</p>
      <p>And new-found fan Fred Harding added: “Dr Fiona Hill told a very dangerous truth today. She did it for each and every one of us. She is a hero.”</p>
      <p>Dr Hill attended the Fife university between 1984 and 1987 before landing a place on an academic exchange to the then Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>Her linked-in profile reveals she earned a master’s degree in Russian studies and modern history before completing a PhD in Soviet studies at Harvard University in the States.</p>
      <p>She told the committee of her Brit background, growing up the daughter of a coal miner in the north east of England before moving to Scotland to start her stellar academic career.</p>
      <p>Dr Hill told the hearing US ambassador Gordon Sondland carried out a "domestic political errand" for the President and didn’t keep her in the loop over Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has been accused of withholding military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Before Dr Hill’s evidence, Mr Trump posted a tweet urging Republican committee members to “keep fighting” because “you are dealing with human scum”.</p>
