      <h1>Sterling falls against the dollar as UK economy slows but US picks up</h1>

      <p>The pound has fallen against the dollar as traders near the end of their week after survey data was better than expected in the US but painted a gloomy picture of the UK economy.</p>
      <p>Sterling was trading 0.59 per cent lower against the greenback by 4.40pm, taking it to $1.283.</p>

      <p>A falling pound alongside positive noises from China concerning a US trade deal helped the FTSE 100 end the day 1.22 per cent higher.</p>
      <p>Traders sold off sterling following a worse-than-expected survey reading which showed that the UK private sector has suffered its biggest fall in output in over three years in November.</p>
      <p>By contrast, US factory and services activity picked up pace this month, a survey from data firm IHS Markit showed.</p>
      <p>The reading, which was better than analysts had hoped for, boosted the dollar. Against the euro, for instance, the dollar has risen 0.25 per cent to €0.906 by 4.40pm UK time.</p>
      <p>Connor Campbell of trading platform Spreadex called the UK figures “nasty, nasty numbers”. He said they were “so bad that sterling was swiftly booted into the red”.</p>
      <p>Andy Scott, associate director at risk assessor JCRA, said: “Sterling reacted negatively to today’s data which points to economic activity declining in November.”</p>
      <p>He added that the reading supports the case made by the two Bank of England rate-setters who voted for a rate cut last month.</p>
      <p>“The economy is clearly reflecting the strain placed on businesses from Brexit negotiations and the continuing state of flux,” he said, “added to which is a general election that includes one major party pushing for a relatively hard Brexit and radical socialist policy proposals from the other.”</p>

      <p>Scott said the outlook for sterling “very much hangs on the outcome of the election, with the currency reacting positive to a number of voting intention polls that give the Conservatives a double-digit lead over the Labour party”.</p>
      <p>A Tory majority is seen by most traders as a positive outcome for the pound as it increases the chances of Britain leaving the EU with a Brexit deal, which they hope would end some of the recent economic uncertainty.</p>
