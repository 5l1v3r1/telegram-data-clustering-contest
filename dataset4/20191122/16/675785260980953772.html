      <h1>I'm A Celeb fans convinced Caitlyn Jenner accidentally confirmed Kylie's pregnant</h1>
      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner spoke about her grandchildren on last night's I'm A Celebrity - but something didn't add up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:56:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Last night saw Caitlyn Jenner open up about her family for the first time on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! - and fans are convinced she accidentally gave away a huge secret about youngest daughter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> .</p>
      <p>As the other campmates relaxed around the gas fire, Jacqueline Jossa and Kate Garraway quizzed Caitlyn about the Kardashian klan and asked how her children - especially Kylie and Kendall Jenner - refer to her post-transition.</p>
      <p>"My kids all call me Dad, Kendall asked me first and I said 'Dad, I'm your Dad and I’ll always be your Dad till the day I die'," she revealed.</p>

      <p>"But what they're really good at which shocks me all the time is when they're talking about me, 'my Dad, she', and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it."</p>
      <p>She added: "Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them."</p>
      <p>Talk then moved on to Caitlyn's many grandchildren, with Kate asking how many she had.</p>
      <p>That's where Caitlyn appeared to slip up, as she said: "20 in December... they call me Boom Boom."</p>
      <p>But viewers were left racking their brains as to which of her children had given birth, as she only had 18 grandchildren by the last count.</p>

      <p>Her stepdaughter Kourtney Kardashian has three children - Mason, Penelope and Reign - while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> has North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> has daughter True, while Kylie has little Stormi.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn's stepson <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rob-kardashian">Rob Kardashian</a> has daughter Dream with his ex Blac Chyna, and her biological son Bert Jenner has two children.</p>
      <p>Casey Jenner has three, and brother Brandon one child with twins due early next year thanks to partner Casey Stoker, adding up to 16 grandchildren with two on the way in 2020.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> users were just as confused by her maths, with one tweeting: "Is it just me or did Caitlin Jenner just say Kylies pregnant?"</p>
      <p>And another wrote: "'COMING UP THIS DECEMBER, 20' -CAITLYN JENNER....IS KYLIE PREGNANT???"</p>
      <p>It wouldn't be the first time Caitlyn has accidentally overshared Kylie's big news.</p>
      <p>Back when she was secretly pregnant with Stormi, Caitlyn gave away the news in an off-hand comment, seemingly confirming the feverish speculation.</p>
      <p>Kylie herself didn't announce her impending motherhood until after she'd given birth, preferring to keep it private among her family and very close friends.</p>
