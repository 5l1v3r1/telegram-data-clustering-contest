      <h2>Scott McTominay is the lowest earner among United's first team, while striker Alexis Sanchez is still one of the club's best-paid players despite being out on loan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:29:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> will fork out over £150 million on player salaries this season as they bid to get back amongst the Premier League's elite.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are one of the biggest spenders on wages for their first-team squad, with some players earning eye-watering sums, as revealed by <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/manchester-united-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-de-gea">David de Gea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Paul Pogba</a> are top of the pile of stars currently at the club in terms of their basic earnings.</p>
      <p>But on-loan flop <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alexis-sanchez">Alexis Sanchez</a> is ranked alongside them, despite him switching to Inter Milan for the season.</p>
      <p>In contrast one of United's top performers so far this season, Scott McTominay, is one of the lowest earners.</p>

      <p>De Gea signed a new six-year contract at Old Trafford in the summer, making him the club's highest-paid player on a staggering £375,000 per week - which totals £19.5million a year.</p>
      <p>His latest deal pitches him just ahead of Sanchez, who will collect £18.2m over the course of the year, although some of that will be subsidised by loan club Inter.</p>
      <p>United's star man and wantaway midfielder Pogba makes up the top three, with a £290,000 weekly salary which equates to annual earnings of just over £15m.</p>

      <p>Strike pairing Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford are the only other two players whose wages top £200,000.</p>
      <p>Martial picks up a cool £250k-a-week (£13m-a-year), with Rashford close behind on £200k (£10.4m).</p>
      <p>New £85m defender Harry Maguire is next on weekly wages just shy of £190k-a-week (£9.8m).</p>

      <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, McTominay earns £10,000-a-week (£520k) - enough to have three teams full of the Scot for the price of one de Gea.</p>
      <p>Perhaps more surprisingly, McTominay cashes in less than Timothy Fosu-Mensah (£15k), Diogo Dalot (£25k), and reserve keeper Lee Grant (£30k).</p>
      <p>Other notable earners include regular scapegoat Fred - who is costing United over £6m per year following his £50m signing last summer.</p>
      <p>Benchwarmer Nemanja Matic sneaks into the top 10 (£6.2m per year), while Chris Smalling is on over £3m per year whilst on loan at Roma.</p>
