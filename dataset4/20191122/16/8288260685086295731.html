      <h1>Birmingham City's U23s continue superb form with comeback win over Hull City</h1>
      <h2>Birmingham City's under-23s clinched their fifth PDL win on the spin against Hull City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:06:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Kane Thompson-Sommers’ late strike gave Birmingham City’s Under 23s their fifth PDL 2 win in succession.</p>
      <p>But Steve Spooner’s side had to come from behind against Hull City to stay top of their league at a sodden Wast Hills.</p>
      <p>Blues edged a scoreless first half, dominating possession and territory and sending in a handful of shots on the Hull goal.</p>
      <p>With Ryan Stirk pulling the strings in midfield and Ryan Burke providing width on the left the hosts pressed forward.</p>
      <p>The pair combined for the best chance of the opening period when, in the 39th minute, the left back lifted an inviting pass over the defence for Stirk to latch on to.</p>

      <p>The Welsh Under 21 took a touch and hammered a shot which Will Mannion pushed away.</p>
      <p>Burke also had a looping cross which dropped just wide of the far post and Mannion needed to claw away Odin Bailey’s deep centre.</p>
      <p>Despite that it was Hull who took the lead three minutes after the restart when Matty Jacob curled in from the left and found Danny Lupano, the defender powered his header into the corner of the net.</p>
      <p>That prompted the Tigers’ best spell of the game as Blues were forced on to the defensive- albeit briefly and the home back four had more to think about.</p>
      <p>However, Hull”s ambition soon faded as Joe Redmond, moved to right back, began to make inroads down the flank.</p>
      <p>Crosses started to fizz across their penalty area.</p>
      <p>Twenty minutes remained when the Irishman won a free kick, which Bailey pulled back to Caolan Boyd-Munce whose low shot from 25 yards was deflected and ballooned up to Miguel Fernandez.</p>

      <p>The Spaniard hooked a shot only to see it blocked by an arm.</p>
      <p>Bailey nervelessly converted the resulting penalty to level the scores.</p>
      <p>Then as the clock turned 90, quick feet from Jack Concannon on the edge of the area worked space for Thompson-Sommers to rifle across Mannion and into the corner.</p>
      <p><b>Blues: </b> Ramos, Gordon (Roberts 45), Burke, Redmond,  Bajrami, Stirk, Concannon, Boyd-Munce, Bailey (Thompson-Sommers 80), Reid (Andrews 60) Fernandez. Not used: Bradley-Hurst, Campbell</p>
