          </p>
          <p>Arsenal will face Southampton in the game-week 13 of the Premier League, and in order to keep the fight alive for their top 4 finish this season, Arsenal needs to find a win from this match.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Southampton is having a disastrous season, and they are in the 19th position in the table, which might cost into a relegation survival battle if things continue similarly for the Saints.</p>

                      <p>But certainly, Arsenal has to vie for the top-4 finish, moreover, with Unai Emery’s job under threat, the Spaniard would be looking forward to fetching positive results in the upcoming games.</p>
                      <p>It is possible that Emery will be making alterations in the lineup against Southampton, as many players have returned from injuries, some have performed poorly and some needs rest after the exhausting international break.</p>

                          <p>As usual, Bernd Leno would be starting between the goalpost. With Hector Bellerin back in the squad, he is expected to be back at the right-back spot.</p>

                            <p>David Luiz is expected to be pair up with Rob Holding and Kieran Tierney taking the left side of the defence. The midfield would be probably of Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi with Mesut Ozil continuing in the central role.</p>
                            <p>Ahead, Pepe is expected to take responsibility on the right flank, Pierre Emrick Aubameyang would be deputed on the left to make space for Alexandre Lacazette as a striker.</p>
