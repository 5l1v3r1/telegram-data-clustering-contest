      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-custody-extends-crypto-staking-to-global-investors">Tezos</a> has partnered with Singapore government-backed blockchain platform Tribe to jointly launch a training program for developers on the Tezos blockchain.</p>
      <p>According to a Nov. 21 <a href="https://www.tezos.org.sg/tezos-southeast-asia-partners-with-tribe-accelerator-to-launch-its-first-ever-official-training-programme-with-the-singapore-government-supported-blockchain-incubator/">blog post</a>, Tezos’s non-profit arm Tezos Southeast Asia (TSA), which is dedicated to promoting Tezos in the region, collaborated with Tribe in order to attract more developers to create Tezos blockchain-based solutions for real-world applications. The training program is set to roll out in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the collaboration, Caleb Kow, president of TSA, said, “by enabling trainers with a good knowledge of Tezos blockchain technology, they will be able to amplify the impact in their respective teams through the continual transfer and sharing of knowledge to new learners.”</p>
      <p>Tezos has previously taken a strong interest in broadening its development community. In September, the foundation <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tezos-foundation-issues-batch-of-grants-to-smart-contract-explorer-projects">released</a> 14 new grants to applications built using Tezos smart contracts, Tezos block explorers, tools for smart contract development, Tezos-focused training resources and marketing initiatives that improve awareness of the ecosystem.</p>
      <h3>Industry-focused education projects in Asia</h3>
      <p>In late October, the Guangzhou government <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-chinese-guangzhou-govt-unveils-140m-blockchain-subsidy-fund">announced</a> a $140 million subsidy fund to encourage the development of blockchain initiatives. Additionally, the government also plans to set up a nationwide blockchain innovation and entrepreneurship contest with a total fund of 10 million yuan ($1.4 million).</p>
      <p>The Malaysian Ministry of Education also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/malaysian-ministry-of-education-fights-fake-degrees-with-blockchain-tec">introduced</a> E-Skrol, an application built on the NEM blockchain to deal with the issue of certificate fraud through using blockchain technology. The E-Skrol application aims to tackle the increasing cases of fake educational degrees in Malaysia, which can be obtained online from so-called diploma mills.</p>
