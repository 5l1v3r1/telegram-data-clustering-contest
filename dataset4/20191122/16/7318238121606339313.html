      <h1>UK a 'rogue state' after missing deadline to handover Chagos Islands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:45:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>The UK has been widely criticised after missing a UN deadline to hand over control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.</p>
      <p>As the due date passed on Friday, the African Union <a href="https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20191122/chairperson-african-union-commission-expresses-concern-over-non-withdrawal">called for a "complete decolonisation" of the islands and expressed "deep concern" for the missed deadline</a>.</p>
      <p>It came a day after Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth told parliament the UK had violated human rights and international law by "maintaining an illegal colonial administration".</p>

      <p>According to a UN advisory ruling in February, the UK acted unlawfully in its separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>In May, the UN General Assembly then voted in favour of the UK relinquishing control of the islands and enacted a six-month deadline.</p>
      <p>But the UK government, which calls the islands the British Indian Ocean Territory, has previously rejected foreign claims of sovereignty.</p>
      <p>In a statement in early November, it said: "The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), which has been under continuous British sovereignty since 1814."</p>
      <p>Euronews has reached out to the UK's foreign office for comment on Friday's expired deadline.</p>

      <p>It comes as a particularly controversial case due to the UK's control of the islands after Mauritius gained independence in 1968 leading to the displacement of thousands of islanders.</p>
      <p>Their displacements made way for a US military base on the archipelago's largest island, Diego Garcia.</p>
      <p>Chagos Support UK, an association of volunteers speaking out for displaced Chagossians, <a href="https://www.chagossupport.org.uk/single-post/2019/11/22/6-months-on-from-UN-General-Assembly-deadline-Chagossians-still-waiting-for-justice">said</a> on Friday the community was "united in demanding their fundamental right to live on their islands and recompense for over fifty years of abuse and neglect."</p>
      <p>It added: "The UN General Assembly and International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict highlighted the vicious treatment of Chagossians to the wider world. Chagossians can not wait any longer."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other experts were also vocal in their criticisms of the UK's lack of response.</p>
      <p>Mark Curtis, a foreign policy and international development expert, <a href="https://twitter.com/markcurtis30/status/1197784543274688513">said</a> the UK was acting the part of "a rogue state" for appearing to ignore the UN's deadline.</p>
      <p>He added: "Nothing sensationalist about this, it's a statement of fact."</p>
      <p>Former British ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray said the UK had shunned the rulings.</p>
      <p>He said: "You can vote not to be a criminal rogue state", in reference to the upcoming general election in December.</p>
