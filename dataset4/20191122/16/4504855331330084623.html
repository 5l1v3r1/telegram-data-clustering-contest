      <p>(WSVN) - A dog with a rare genetic condition is melting hearts across the internet.</p>
      <p>Ranger, a 2-year-old German Shepherd, has “pituitary dwarfism,” a genetic disorder that prevents him from growing, FOX 13 <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/german-shepherd-stuck-in-perpetual-puppyhood-due-to-rare-genetic-condition">reports</a>.</p>

      <p>Its owner, Shelby Mayo, spoke with British news agency SWNS to highlight her journey with Ranger.</p>
      <p>“When we originally got Ranger from the breeder, he was smaller than all his other litter mates, but we figured that was because he had a parasite called Coccidia,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mayo took Ranger to the vet to be treated for the parasite, but he later contracted another parasite.</p>
      <p>Ranger also remained small in size.</p>
      <p>“The vet had suspected that he may have pituitary dwarfism,” Mayo told SWNS. “But we were still skeptical as this condition is very rare.”</p>
      <p>Not long after, one of the nearly 80,000 followers on an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ranger_thegshepherd/">Instagram page</a> dedicated to Ranger provided some insight.</p>
      <p>The follower also owns a dog with pituitary dwarfism and advised that Ranger may be suffering from low thyroid levels, one of the condition’s symptoms.</p>
      <p>“So our vet checked his thyroid levels and sure enough he was low,” Mayo said. “This can cause hair loss and a loss of appetite.”</p>
      <p>Despite the diagnosis and symptoms, Mayo says Ranger is “healthy and happy as can be as of now.”</p>
