        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/tesla">Tesla</a> on Thursday night revealed the Cybertruck, its new six-person pickup truck.</li>
        <li>The electric <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-tesla-cybertruck-launch-blooper-armour-windows-smashed-oops-2019-11">truck</a> ranges in price between $39,990 and $76,900, and production is planned to begin by the end of 2021.</li>
        <li>The vehicle’s specs and a rendering of the truck at a campsite with tent and cooking add-ons have some Tesla fans speculating that a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Cybercamper&amp;amp;src=typed_query">‘Cybercamper’</a> may one day be possible.</li>

      <p>Tesla Cybertruck’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/post/preview?post_id=5dd805b8fd9db27a0e26ab82&amp;amp;mode=desktop">controversial style</a> and decked out armor-like exterior and towing capability seem like overkill for everyday driving, but they could be perfect for camping just about anywhere.</p>
      <p>During the presentation, Tesla emphasized that the Cybertruck is “completely adaptable for your needs.” The company is marketing the truck as the best of a truck and a sports car, but information on its website hints at other future possibilities.</p>

      <p>The most expensive edition of the Cybertruck has 100 cubic feet of storage space, which would be useful for camping gear.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s renderings at least show that the company is thinking about the possibility of a camper conversion, with one image showing a tent attached over the truck bed and what appears to be cooking attachments on the tailgate.</p>

      <p>Tesla fans have shown an interest in converting their electric vehicles into more comfortable places to sleep in the past. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dreamcase-tesla-tiny-home-converting-back-into-bed-2019-11">Dreamcase</a> sells mattresses designed for specific car models, designed to “transform your car into a luxury double bed.” It already sells mattresses for three current Tesla models.</p>

      <p>Regardless of whether Tesla releases more information about possible camper conversions, the Cybertruck design already has the ability to tow an RV. The Cybertruck has a towing capacity of up to 14,000 lbs, which is more than enough to tow even the <a href="https://camperreport.com/how-much-do-airstream-trailers-weigh-a-towing-guide/">heaviest Airstream</a> on the market.</p>
