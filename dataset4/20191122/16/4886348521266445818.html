      <ul>
        <li>Starfield development is in trouble, according to a new rumor.</li>
        <li>The aftermath of the Fallout 76 disaster is to blame.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, Creation Engine limitations may be affecting production.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A new rumor reports that Bethesda’s upcoming sci-fi RPG, Starfield, is weathering significant development roadblocks as the studio scrambles to save Fallout 76 after a disastrous launch.</p>

      <p>The rumor comes from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/dzkgwk/bethesdas_new_ip_starfield_is_experiencing/">Reddit user unimaginatively sporting the StarfieldLeaker handle</a>. At this point, we’ll refer you to the all too familiar refrain of exercising skepticism and taking all this with a generous pinch of salt. You know the drill.</p>
      <h3>The Fallout 76 Problem</h3>
      <p>The rumor explains that Fallout 76 has forced studio head, Todd Howard, to juggle multiple projects simultaneously. As a result, he’s been less involved in the day to day development of Starfield.</p>
      <p>StarfieldLeaker also suggests that Fallout 76 has hogged resources at both the publishing and development levels. Recent attempts to reverse the game’s fortunes attest to this.</p>
      <p>Most recently, Bethesda unveiled the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st">Fallout 1st $100-per-year premium subscription service</a>, which, as you can imagine, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/fallout-76-critics-raze-bethesdas-money-grubbing-99-a-year-subscription/">went down like a lead balloon among the player base</a>.</p>
      <p>In tandem, the studio continues to work on the elusive NPC-introducing Wastelanders update. Initially slated for release by the end of this year, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/fallout-76-suffers-blow-bethesda-delays-update/">it was pushed back to next year</a>.</p>

      <h3>Starfield Production Hurdles</h3>
      <p>On the production side of things, the leak suggests Starfield’s development isn’t all that peachy either. Bethesda’s proprietary Creation Engine allegedly struggles to keep up with the demands of fast-paced space flight.</p>
      <p>StarfieldLeaker says:</p>
      <blockquote>The Creation Engine’s cell-based loading system causes significant frame hiccups when trying to incorporate fast-moving vehicles.</blockquote>
      <p>Not exactly what you want to hear about a space-faring role-playing title. Then again, this could be viewed as a natural game development hurdle that Bethesda will invariably overcome in time.</p>
      <p>To rounds things off, it appears that having scattered Bethesda Game Studios subsidiary locations is proving detrimental to cohesion among the teams involved in Starfield. That’s slowing progress even further.</p>
      <p>As stated above, this remains a rumor, but if true, these roadblocks don’t bode well for a studio that desperately needs a win.</p>
