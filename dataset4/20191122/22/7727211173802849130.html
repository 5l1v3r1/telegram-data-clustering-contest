      <p>But as comedian Andrew ate a large part of camel and started to choke as it got stuck in his throat.</p>
      <p>Kate and Andy started to hit his back as he knelt down, eventually the meat came out and Jacqueline got him some water.</p>
      <p>Myles said: “Chew your food, mate you scared us."</p>
      <p>Kate said: “You went bright red, I was like ‘oh my god’.”</p>
