      <h1>Daniel Levy: the Tottenham chairman taking a gamble on José Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>British businessman is a football pragmatist who has shown himself unafraid of taking unpopular decisions</h2>

      <p>Daniel Levy, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, was asked two months ago if manager Mauricio Pochettino was set to leave the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>“[Not] unless you know something I don’t know, he’s very happy,” Mr Levy told the Financial Times. “We’ve got a great team, a great coach, and we’re optimistic for the future.”</p>
      <p>Yet this week, he fired Mr Pochettino. No matter that the Argentine coach had just this summer led Tottenham to its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9ede30d0-84c1-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2">first</a> Champions League final, Europe’s most prestigious club competition.</p>
      <p>A poor run of form at the start of this season has left the team in 14th place in English football’s top tier, leading Mr Levy to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/efc045cc-0b0a-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">hire a replacement</a> in José Mourinho, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56acdd82-02d2-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1">former</a> Manchester United and Chelsea manager.</p>
      <p>While fans were taken aback, people close to Mr Levy recognised the ruthless streak in a man known as one of the toughest negotiators in football.</p>
      <p>The British businessman has often made unpopular decisions during two decades of leading the North London club he supported as a boy. But over that period he has also catapulted Tottenham from mid-table mediocrity into the sport’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bec65898-56ca-11e9-a3db-1fe89bedc16e">financial elite</a>.</p>
      <p>That has been achieved partly through regular appearances in the Champions League, where participating teams share in more than €2bn in broadcasting and prize money.</p>

      <p>Hiring Mr Mourinho, a serial trophy winner who has lifted the Champions League twice, is designed to improve the chances of qualifying for the money-spinning continental tournament. But it is a risky move as the Portuguese has also made a habit of acrimonious exits from his previous clubs.</p>
      <p>“Take it from people who have had to deal with Daniel and José in the football industry, they’re made for each other,” said a senior football industry executive who knows the pair. “And they’re certainly welcome to each other.”</p>
      <p>Graduating from Cambridge university in 1985, Mr Levy went on to work for his family business Mr Byrite, a clothing retailer. In 1995, he became managing director of ENIC Group, a sports and media investment company majority owned by Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis, which first acquired a minority stake in Tottenham in 2000. Mr Levy and his family owns close to 30 per cent of ENIC, which over time gained a controlling share in the club.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, Tottenham established itself among the “Big Six” in English football, which includes Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea. Each is among the world’s 10 highest-earning football clubs, owing in part to their share in the Premier League’s multiyear broadcasting rights, currently worth £9.2bn.</p>
      <p>Under Mr Pochettino’s five years as manager, the team failed to win a significant competition but qualified for the Champions League in the past four seasons. That success is particularly striking because the English club’s wage bill has been the lowest among the big six. Academic research has shown the best predictor of a team’s league position is how much it spends on player salaries.</p>
      <p>Mr Levy’s ability to hire good players yet stick to a frugal business plan has been shown in transfer negotiations. In 2012, after securing a £11.3m deal to acquire goalkeeper Hugo Lloris from Lyon, the French club’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, said: “The negotiation with the Tottenham directors has been the hardest I have ever had to undergo in 25 years. We had people speaking all night with Daniel Levy. He talks a lot and goes back on what we’ve agreed in writing.”</p>
      <p>In response to this article, Mr Aulas contacted the FT via Mr Levy’s office to clarify his earlier remarks. “There was never any written agreement that he didn’t honour,” he said. “We know each other very well and our relationship is excellent.”</p>
      <p>Mr Levy’s biggest deal was the building of a new £1.2bn stadium, which opened in April this year in a move designed to further raise revenues and compete with Europe’s megaclubs.</p>

      <p>Mark Tucker, non-executive group chairman at HSBC, who helped Mr Levy <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5931cd8-da1a-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">refinance £600m</a> of debt related to the new stadium this year, said: “Working closely with Daniel for many years, my very positive experience of him is that he always focuses on doing the right thing for the club and doing it the right way.”</p>
      <p>Mr Levy has decided the right thing for Tottenham now is to change managers. It is an unusually expensive move for him, costing up to £12.5m in payments to Mr Pochettino over the remainder of a 2½-year coaching contract. Mr Mourinho has been hired on a comparable financial package, according to a person close to the club, on a deal that runs until the end of the 2022-23 season.</p>
      <p>The shift will have been worth the cost if Tottenham retains its new-found, lofty status.</p>
      <p>“As I am a fan, clearly you want to win on the pitch,” Mr Levy said in September. “But we have been trying to look at this slightly differently, in that we want to make sure we have an infrastructure here to stand the test of time. That takes enormous amounts of capital, determination and vision.”</p>
