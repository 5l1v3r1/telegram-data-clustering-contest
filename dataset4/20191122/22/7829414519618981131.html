      <p>China is not vying to become the first among major global economies to launch its fiat digital currency, Zhu Min, former deputy governor of China's central bank, said on Friday.<br/><br/>"It doesn't matter if [China] will be the first, and no one is vying to become the world's No.1," Zhu, former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC), said in response to a question raised  by the Global Times on the sidelines of the New Economy Forum co-hosted by Bloomberg and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing.<br/><br/>The most important thing for China's digital currency push is to ensure the policy and technology framework are mature, he noted.<br/><br/>China, Canada, Britain and Singapore are at the forefront of digital currency research, said Zhu, also an ex-IMF official. <br/><br/>Digital currency is a future trend, and central banks are under pressure from the market as cryptocurrencies are eroding sovereign currencies. <br/><br/>Small countries in particular are worried that their sovereign currencies may take a hit if they don't issue digital ones, Zhu stated.<br/><br/>The central bank of Uruguay was the world's first to become digital-currency-ready, following its announcement in November 2017 that it would begin a test to issue digital Uruguayan pesos. <br/><br/>Zhu reckons that Facebook's Libra poses a potential challenge for sovereign currencies issued by central banks.<br/><br/>According to Zhu, the PBC-backed digital currency plan known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment is a feasible and controllable framework which was envisioned to allow for effective monetary policy transmission. <br/><br/>The PBC began to research digital currency in 2014. It has a digital currency research institute and a special team for this purpose, PBC Governor Yi Gang revealed in September, noting that presently, progress is being made. <br/><br/>The former deputy managing director of the IMF also touched on the thorny trade issue involving the world's two largest economies during the interview. <br/><br/>"There have been detailed discussions about trade figures during the China-US trade talks, but the US has always taken more things into consideration, complicating the negotiations," he said.<br/><br/>"The trade talks are contingent upon the US eventually becoming aware of the problem and thus striving to sit down with China to address some final issues," he said.<br/><b>RELATED ARTICLES:</b></p>
