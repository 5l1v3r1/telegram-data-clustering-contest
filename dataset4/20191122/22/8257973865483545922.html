      <h1>Former CIA officer sentenced to 19 years for conspiring to sell secrets to China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:18:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author">Christen McCurdy</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- A former CIA officer was sentenced to 19 years in prison Friday for conspiring to provide American intelligence secrets to the Chinese government.</p>
      <p>Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/05/01/Former-CIA-agent-pleads-guilty-to-conspiring-to-spy-for-China/3141556765298/">pleaded guilty in May</a> to conspiracy to deliver national defense information to a foreign government. He was <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/05/08/Ex-CIA-agent-charged-with-spying-for-China/7111525830628/">arrested in 2018</a>.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice has acknowledged there is no evidence Lee gave secrets to the Chinese -- merely that he conspired to do so.</p>
      <p>Lee worked for the CIA for 13 years in a variety of locations, including China in 2007.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/former-cia-officer-sentenced-19-years-conspiring-chinese-spies-n1089341">Lee has admitted</a> that in 2010 he was recruited by Chinese intelligence agents, promising financial rewards in exchange for secret information. Prosecutors say between May 2010 and December 2013 Lee deposited $840,000 cash into his Hong Kong bank account, though he was operating an unsuccessful consulting business at the time.</p>
      <p>"For this amount of money, the [Chinese] must have been getting really top drawer, high quality national defense information," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/former-cia-officer-set-to-be-sentenced-in-chinese-spying-conspiracy/2019/11/21/4411eeaa-0aed-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Hammerstrom argued</a>. "We put all the pieces together ... He sold out his country for money."</p>
      <p>An August 2012, the FBI raided a Honolulu, Hawaii, hotel room registered to Lee and found a thumb drive with a document Lee had created that included information about the CIA's activities.</p>
      <p>They also found a day planner and address book that included notes of intelligence provided by CIA agent, as well as information about their identities, operational meeting locations and covert facilities.</p>
      <p>Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is the third former U.S. intelligence officer to be convicted of conspiring to give secrets to the Chinese.</p>
