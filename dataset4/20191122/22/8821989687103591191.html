      <h1>30 Years Ago: ‘Back to the Future II’ Doubles Down on Time Travel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:59:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:59</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Christopher</a></address>
      <p>At the end of 1985’s <i>Back to the Future</i>, Doc Brown corralled Marty McFly and his girlfriend Jennifer Parker into his time-traveling DeLorean before delivering the soon-to-be-iconic line, "Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads." At that point, the car soared into the sky, flying off to parts unknown. The trio’s destination was revealed in a sequel that hit theaters November 22, 1989, in the form of <i>Back to the Future II</i>.</p>
      <p>Despite the first film’s cliffhanger, another entry wasn’t initially in the cards. However, when the original <i>Back to the Future</i> became the highest grossing movie of 1985, studio execs saw the chance for further profit, an outlook common in a sequel-filled decade that had seen <i>Rambo</i>, <i>Rocky</i>, <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Halloween</i>, <i>Star Trek</i> and dozens more capitalize on the triumph of their predecessors.</p>
      <p>Director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale agreed to return for a second film, with one caveat. "We said, 'If <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/michael-j-fox/">Michael J. Fox</a> and <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/christopher-lloyd/">Christopher Lloyd</a> will sign on for a sequel, yes we'll do a sequel,'" Gale recalled in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCvVF6y_y5Q">documentary</a> covering the <i>Back to the Future</i> films. "Because if we have Marty and Doc, we can figure a story out. If we don't have those guys, there's no movie." Both actors were eager to reprise their roles, setting events in motion for a second film.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Once the principals of the original were signed up, an add-on was made to the final scene of the 1986 home video release of <i>Back to the Future</i> which saw a “To Be Continued…” title card flash on the screen as “Back in Time” by <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/huey-lewis/">Huey Lewis and the News</a> kicked in.</p>
      <p>The sequel's plot would see Doc (Lloyd), Marty (Fox) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) voyage to 2015 to stop Marty Junior from partaking in a robbery that would set off a disastrous chain of events for the McFly family. Initially the mission is a success, as Marty thwarts his future son’s involvement by posing as him and turning down the illegal activity. However, Marty sets in motion a new series of events when he picks up a sports almanac for the years 1950-2000 with plans to use the book's information to make money by gambling when he gets back to 1985. Doc finds out and lectures the teen on the dangers of such a scheme before tossing the book into the trash. Unbeknownst to them, an elderly Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is eavesdropping. While the pair go off to find Jennifer, who Doc had tranquilized to keep from asking about the future, Biff grabs the almanac and delivers it to his 1955 self.</p>
      <p>Marty and Doc return to 1985 and leave a passed-out Jennifer asleep on her porch, but soon discover that all is not well. The neighborhood is an apocalyptic wasteland where gangs rule the streets and crime is rampant. It turns out Biff has parlayed his sports betting into an empire and has married Marty’s mother. His real father, George McFly, died years earlier when he was shot in an alley – by Biff, it turns out – on his way to receive an award for writing. The task for Marty and Doc is clear; they must go back to 1955 and retrieve the sports almanac from young Biff, thus preventing this horrific alternate future.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The movie's scenes are then brilliantly cut with the 1955 scenarios played out in the first film as Marty dresses the part of a spy in sunglasses, black leather jacket and fedora to case Biff with the almanac, all while the events at the 'Enchantment Under the Sea' dance from the original <i>Back to the Future</i> are taking place. Using a hoverboard brought with him from 2015, Marty is able to hold onto Biff’s speeding car and retrieve the sports book. He’s then saved from certain death by Doc who pulls him out of harm's way using the flying DeLorean moments before Biff would have run the teen over.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Marty burns the almanac to ashes. Just as he is about to board the DeLorean alongside Doc to head back to 1985, the hovering car is struck by lighting and disappears.</p>
      <p>A bewildered Marty stares at the empty sky as a heavy rainfall descends until a car drives up to him and a man from Western Union gets out and presents him with a letter. It’s from Doc, who got zapped back to 1885 and is living happily. Marty rushes back into town to find 1955 Doc, who has just sent Marty – from the original movie – back to 1985. Marty tells his shocked scientist friend that he is back from the future, causing Doc to faint as the words “To Be Concluded…” flash on the screen.</p>
      <p>No matter what happened with <i>Back to the Future II</i> at the box office, there was going to be another one as indicated by a minute-long trailer shown before the credits ran. <i>II</i> and <i>III</i> were filmed back-to-back, with the latter set in the Old West where Doc Brown ended up at the conclusion of the second.</p>
      <p><i>Back to the Future II</i> didn’t do gangbusters like the first one, but it more than held its own with a domestic gross of nearly <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Back-to-the-Future-Part-II#tab=summary">$118.5 million</a>, placing it in the top five for the year. The film didn’t come without controversy as two main characters were replaced. Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in the original, had taken a hiatus from acting to care for her sick mother and was replaced by Shue. Crispin Glover, who played George McFly in <i>Back to the Future</i>, was also replaced after a contract dispute, but filmmakers used archival footage as well as a cast of his face to mold a likeness onto a replacement actor, Jeffrey Weissman. The former sued Universal Pictures in a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/back-future-ii-a-legal-833705">landmark lawsuit</a>. The resultant ruling changed how Screen Actors Guild members were compensated for likenesses and archival footage going forward.</p>
      <p>Conspicuously absent from the movie was a rock and roll song tie in. <i>Back to the Future</i> nailed it with Huey Lewis and the News’ “Power of Love,” while the third installment had the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/zz-top/">ZZ Top</a> single <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-back-to-the-future-iii/">“Doubleback.”</a> Conversely, <i>Back to the Future II</i> was almost entirely scored. <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/sammy-hagar/">Sammy Hagar’s</a> “I Can’t Drive 55” plays for a bit when Marty arrives at Biff Tannen’s Pleasure Paradise in the dystopian 1985, but the track was never used to promote the film.</p>
      <p>Much has been made in recent years about what the movie got right about the year 2015. We’re still waiting for hoverboards that work like they did onscreen, self-lacing sneakers aren’t widely available just yet and there’s no indication cars will be flying anytime soon. However, biometrics like fingerprint and retina scans are a thing, as is a baseball team from Miami. And as laughably unlikely as it was at the time, the film was just one year off in predicting the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series, which they did in 2016 for the first time in 108 years.</p>

      <h3>25 '80s Movie Sequels That Shouldn't Have Been Made</h3>

      <h4>'Airplane II: The Sequel' (1982)</h4>
      <p>Hollywood protocol insists that everything in a sequel needs to be bigger. Stakes must be raised, explosions must be louder, budgets must be exceeded. So, when looking to create a sequel to the 1980 comedy ‘Airplane,’ producers took the story from the sky to outer space. Yes, instead of a plane, characters Ted Striker and Elaine Dickinson would instead find themselves in a shuttle, once again working to save passengers and crew from certain death. Much of the original cast returned for the sequel, though noticeably absent was the dry wit of Leslie Nielsen. Also missing: the writing team from the first film. Instead, Ken Finkleman was brought in to write and direct. 1982 was quite a year for the screenwriter; not only did he helm 'Airplane II,' but he also penned another movie found on this list, 'Grease 2.' 'Airplane II' was loaded with gags, yet none came close to matching the quality of the original. It was greeted with a modest box office response before quietly fading away.</p>

      <h4>'Arthur 2: On the Rocks' (1988)</h4>
      <p>The 1981 romantic-comedy 'Arthur' saw Dudley Moore playing a lovable, drunken millionaire in the title role. Liza Minelli co-starred as Linda Marolla, the working-class woman who Arthur falls for. The flick was a critical and financial success and earned Moore an Academy Award nomination. Though both stars returned for the sequel, the magic between them did not. The 'Los Angeles Times' called 'Arthur 2' “excruciating,” the 'New York Times' labelled it “unimaginative” and the 'Washington Post' said, “it’s not a film, it’s a relapse.” ‘Arthur 2’ earned $14 million at the box office, roughly $80 million less than the original.</p>

        <figcaption>Warner Bros.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Caddyshack II' (1988)</h4>
      <p>It’s easy to look at 'Caddyshack II' and wonder, “How did they ever expect to make this without Bill Murray or Rodney Dangerfield?” Murray said he had no interest in a sequel, but Rodney Dangerfield actually loved the idea. Writer Harold Ramis told the A.V. Club that “with 'Caddyshack II,' the studio begged me. They said, ‘Hey, we've got a great idea: The Shack is Back!'’ And I said, ‘No, I don't think so.’ But they said that Rodney really wanted to do it, and we could build it around Rodney.” Dangerfield was initially on-board, but he soon had a falling out with the studio. Undeterred, producers decided to push forth with 'Caddyshack II.' Ramis attempted to distance himself from the project, but his efforts were rebuffed. “I tried to take my name off that one, but they said if I took my name off, it would come out in the trades and I would hurt the film." Chevy Chase was the only star from the original to return for the sequel. He later admitted he regretted doing so. Lacking the star power, laughs and general fun of the first film, 'Caddyshack II' was a box office bomb. The flick only earned $11.8 million, roughly half its production budget.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Fletch Lives' (1989)</h4>
      <p>The character of Fletch captured Chevy Chase in his mid-'80s prime. As an investigative newspaper reporter who stumbles upon a drug ring, the actor delivered hilarious one-liners and donned silly disguises, all with that trademark smirk on his face. Unfortunately, by the time ‘Fletch Lives’ rolled around, many of these ingredients had begun to wear thin. Whereas Chase’s previous portrayal was that of lovable-smart-aleck, his wit came across as spiteful and mean in the sequel. The film’s jokes bordered on sexist, homophobic and racist, while Fletch’s ridiculous disguises were even less fun. Despite harsh critical response, ‘Fletch Lives’ still managed to be a box office success.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Big Top Pee-wee' (1988)</h4>
      <p>This sequel to ‘Pee-wee’s Big Adventure’ lacked many elements that helped make the original film such a success. Gone was Tim Burton, the visionary director who helped balance Pee-wee’s wide-eyed persona with the real world. Gone was Phil Hartman, the comedian who co-wrote the original film’s script. And, though Paul Reubens returned to reprise his title role, gone was the spark that made Pee-wee so lovable. Instead, viewers got a weak plot based around a circus and musician Kris Kristofferson playing a ringmaster. It’s not that ‘Big Top Pee-wee’ is bad as much as it is forgettable.</p>

      <h4>'Grease 2' (1982)</h4>
      <p>There were several ingredients that made the original 1978 film 'Grease' film such a success. The chemistry between stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John was undeniable, while the supporting cast played their roles perfectly. The songs were well-written and catchy, with many becoming pop-culture staples for future generations. Most of all, the film was fun, delivering a charm that enabled it to become the highest-grossing musical of its time. Sadly, 1982’s 'Grease 2' could not capture even one of the elements that made its predecessor such a success. The story was similar to the first, with a new batch of seniors singing their way through Rydell High School. The songs were forgettable, the dialogue forced and the cast, despite the film debut of a young Michelle Pfieffer, brought little to the table. 'Grease 2' flopped upon release, earning a total of $15.2 million during its run in theaters, roughly $380 million less than the original.</p>

      <h4>'Teen Wolf Too' (1987)</h4>
      <p>It’s understandable if you’ve forgotten about 'Teen Wolf Too.' Its star, Jason Bateman, would probably be happy if you did. After the first film became a modest hit with Michael J. Fox in the lead role, studio executives began plotting a sequel. With Fox bowing out, they decided to cast Bateman in his first feature film role. The plot was loosely structured around a teen going to college, only to discover that thanks to a family trait, he’s genetically part werewolf. There’s also some romance and boxing matches thrown in there, but at this point you don’t care. Movie goers certainly didn’t. ‘Teen Wolf Too’ pulled in less than $8 million during its theatrical run.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Crocodile Dundee II' (1988)</h4>
      <p>The original ‘Crocodile Dundee’ was more than a surprise hit. The comedy about an Australian bushman and his exploits in New York became a worldwide phenomenon. The film brought in more than $300 million and launched Paul Hogan into stardom. The actor received an Academy Award nomination for the film’s screenplay and even co-hosted the 1987 ceremony. While a ‘Crocodile Dundee’ sequel came as no surprise, it suffered a severe hangover from the first film. Many of the gags had a "seen this before" feel to them. Even worse, the plot, which centered on Mick Dundee trying to rescue his girlfriend from South American drug dealers, felt uninspired. In their review, the 'Washington Post' said viewers would likely “nap through” the film due to its slow pace. The 'New York Times' added that Crocodile Dundee’s “novelty has begun to wear thin.” Despite being bashed by critics, the film still did well at the global box office, earning more than $200 million worldwide.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Staying Alive' (1983)</h4>
      <p>Almost immediately following the success of ‘Saturday Night Fever,’ producers began plotting a sequel. Despite attempts to move quickly, disagreements between screenwriter Norman Wexler and star John Travolta kept the film in limbo. Wexler wanted to maintain the gritty realism of the first film, while Travolta wanted a happier story. Eventually, the actor got his way, especially once Sylvester Stallone was brought in to rewrite and direct. The result was a film Roger Ebert called “a mess.” “The characters are clichés, their lives are clichés and God knows their dialogue is clichés,” Ebert proclaimed in his 1983 review. Many others felt the same way. The movie became one of the most panned films in history, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2007, 'Entertainment Weekly' called ‘Staying Alive’ the ‘Worst Sequel of All Time.’</p>

      <h4>'Conan the Destroyer' (1984)</h4>
      <p>The 1982 fantasy/action film 'Conan the Barbarian' saw Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing his medieval muscle. The R-rated film featured plenty of guts and gore, as Conan used his violent might to avenge his parents’ death. The original earned more than $100 million against a $16 million budget, so it’s no surprise that producers decided to make a sequel in hopes of further profiting on Conan’s appeal. Unfortunately, 'Conan the Destroyer' lacked the darkness of its predecessor, instead opting for a more comedic tone. The PG-rated sequel replaced bloodshed with physical gags, resulting in a watered-down and ultimately less entertaining movie. 'Destroyer' was a box office disappointment and, due to the film’s weak returns, ideas for a third film in the Conan series were scrapped.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3' (1983)</h4>
      <p>The first Smokey and the Bandit film featured Burt Reynolds as a bootlegger, Sally Field as his love interest and Jackie Gleason as the sheriff out to get him. It was a smash hit, earning over $300 million, the second highest grossing film of 1977 behind only 'Star Wars.' The next film in the series returned the same group of stars, but was a poor copy of the first - instead of booze, Bandit is sneaking an elephant across state lines. The sequel was roundly panned, but it did earn a significant box office return, so naturally a third installment was made. At this point, Field was gone, and Reynolds only appeared in a small cameo. Jackie Gleason reprised his role as Smokey, but ‘Part 3’ largely ran on fumes. Test audiences reacted so negatively to the film that half of it was reshot. This effort did not improve the product. ‘Smokey and the Bandit Part 3’ was a box office flop, earning $2 million less than it cost to make.</p>

      <h4>'Cannonball Run II' (1984)</h4>
      <p>A cursory glance might fool you into thinking that ‘Cannonball Run II’ was actually a good sequel. After all, it featured a star-studded cast, including Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise and the members of the Rat Pack. It also earned over $56 million at the box office, more than doubling its production budget. Yet, ‘Cannonball Run II’ remains one of the worst sequels of all-time. 'Variety' said its “execution is uninspired, laughs are hard to find, and the script is also difficult to locate.” Roger Ebert called it "one of the laziest insults to the intelligence of moviegoers that I can remember.” Gene Siskel, Ebert's reviewing cohort, said it “gives films a bad name.”</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Cocoon: The Return' (1988)</h4>
      <p>A sweet-natured film with a tinge of sci-fi, the original ‘Cocoon’ told the story of a group of elderly friends who discovered a fountain of youth when peaceful aliens arrive on Earth. The flick was a box office hit, pulling in over $76 million while also scoring two Academy Awards. Though director Ron Howard was not on board for the sequel, all of the original cast did. Sadly, ‘The Return’ lacked the charm and soul of the first film and eventually proved a failure at the box office. Though it may not be as egregious an offense as some of the other movies on this list, the ‘Cocoon’ sequel was simply unnecessary.</p>

      <h4>'2010: The Year We Make Contact' (1984)</h4>
      <p>Stanley Kubrick’s ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ was a cinematic masterpiece, regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It’s sequel wasn’t. Working 16 years after the 1968 classic, director Peter Hyams assembled a talented cast that included Roy Scheider, Helen Mirren and John Lithgow. If viewed solely on its own merits, the sequel is a fine, albeit somewhat forgettable film. The story is engaging, the visuals compelling and the special effects impressive for their time. Unfortunately, ‘2010: The Year We Make Contact’ crumbles under the weight of its predecessor. Kubrick’s film simply set the bar set so high, there was no way ‘2010’ would do anything but disappoint.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Jaws 3-D' (1983)</h4>
      <p>To be fair, none of the Jaws sequels probably should have been made. The original Steve Spielberg-directed film is the perfect balance of suspense and horror. Its followers were little more than popcorn flicks, developed to cash in on the Jaws name. Still, for the sake of argument, we’ll pick ‘Jaws 3-D’ as the guiltiest culprit of the group. Not only was the plot weak, but gratuitous scenes were shot purely to make use of the suddenly popular-again 3-D movie experience. The events of ‘Jaws 3-D’ were entirely independent of the other Jaws movies. As such, when Universal Studios released the final Jaws film, ‘Jaws: The Revenge,’ in 1987 they referred to it as the third part of the trilogy.</p>

      <h4>'Poltergeist II: The Other Side' (1986)</h4>
      <p>The original 'Poltergeist' film was written and produced by Steven Spielberg. When the cinematic legend declined to return for the sequel, it signaled that there would likely be a drop in quality from the first to second film. Still, nothing could prepare viewers for how steep that drop actually was. 'The Other Side' attempted to strike similar scary-nerves as its predecessor, yet somehow failed on all accounts. The visuals were cheesy, while the plot was uninspired. The 'Washington Post' may have said it best in their review when they wrote, “There are movies that make you want to mince words, and then there's 'Poltergeist II: The Other Side,' a movie so ineffably bad, you can't even find the words to mince."</p>

      <h4>'Porky's II: The Next Day' (1983)</h4>
      <p>No one will ever confuse the original ‘Porky’s’ film with ‘Citizen Kane.’ The 1981 comedy was a low-brow sex romp based around a group of teenagers looking to get laid. The formula was simple, but it had a certain magnetism. The characters were fun and their misadventures provided plenty of humorous situations. By comparison, this 1983 follow-up provided far less charm and even fewer laughs. A dull plot, coupled with mindless (even offensive) gags left moviegoers disappointed. While the original film earned over $100 million at the box office and helped launch a wave of teen-sex comedies, ‘Porky’s II’ made roughly $33 million.</p>

      <h4>'Return to Oz' (1985)</h4>
      <p>Making the sequel to a beloved classic is always a tall task. Doing so 46 years after the original film’s release is downright daunting. Still, that’s what Disney decided to do with 'Return to Oz.' The plot, loosely based on author L. Frank Baum's novels, saw Dorothy revisiting the Land of Oz, only to find it has been overthrown by the evil Nome King. Problems plagued the production from the get-go. Shooting fell behind schedule, costs went over budget and director Walter Murch was fired and rehired by Disney. In the end, the sequel was a much less accessible film than its legendary predecessor. Moviegoers were turned off by its darker tone, which the 'Chicago Reader' called “bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying.” ‘Return to Oz’ earned $11 million at the box office, well short of its reported $20 million production budget.</p>

      <h4>'Return to Snowy River' (1988)</h4>
      <p>An Australian western film featuring elements of adventure and romance, ‘The Man From Snowy River’ became a surprising international success in 1982. Star Kirk Douglas, who was embroiled in a lawsuit with filmmakers over his share of the original film’s profits, declined to return for the sequel. He was replaced by Brian Dennehy. Though the second film was still extremely popular in its homeland, it failed to reach a worldwide audience the way its predecessor did.</p>

      <h4>'Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise' (1988)</h4>
      <p>“This is a movie that doesn't just make you feel dumb, it makes you feel as if your head has been hollowed out and pumped full of Cheez Whiz.” That’s how the 'Washington Post' described ‘Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise.’ It’s hard to argue with their assessment. While the original 'Nerds' picture had plenty of gross-out humor, the sequel ratcheted it up even higher with fart gags and bodily fluids galore. The plot centered on the Tri-Lamb nerds squaring off against a super-cool fraternity at the annual convention in Florida, but do you really care? The story structure is so weak and the jokes so mindless, the film somehow leaves viewers feeling dumb. That's ironic considering its characters are supposed to be geniuses.</p>

      <h4>'Short Circuit II' (1988)</h4>
      <p>In the first ‘Short Circuit,’ much of the story follows robot Johnny 5's attempts to understand his human-like intelligence and emotions, the side-effect of a lightning strike. The sequel sees Johnny 5 move to New York in an effort to help his scientist pal Ben get his new toy business off the ground. There is the potential for a fun film here; an innocent, fish-out-of-water robot trying to understand life in the big city is an interesting starting point for a story. However, ‘Short Circuit II’ went off the rails when it added a completely unnecessary subplot based on jewelry thieves and an attempted bank heist. The sequel received mixed reviews and poor box office numbers, though it did sustain longevity as family-friendly filler on basic-cable television.</p>

      <h4>'The Fly II' (1989)</h4>
      <p>This sequel to the 1986 horror flick ‘The Fly’ is not for the faint of heart. The gore is ramped up, with enough blood, guts and gross-out moments to make even the most ardent moviegoer cringe. While filmmakers made sure to bring plenty of special effects to the sequel, they forgot to pack a plot. The story, focused on the son of the first film’s scientist-turned-bug, is flimsy at best. Without Jeff Goldblum's Seth Brundle to hold the piece together, ‘The Fly II’ crumbles into a mess of splattered blood and lazy dialogue.</p>

      <h4>'The Gods Must Be Crazy II' (1989)</h4>
      <p>1980’s ‘The Gods Must Be Crazy’ was an unexpected international success. The comedy, which used the simple story of an African tribe learning about the modern world, remains the most commercially successful film in South Africa’s history, earning more than $200 million at the global box office. Its sequel was a stark reminder that lightning doesn’t strike twice. Despite returning its main characters and following a similar comedy style, ‘The Gods Must Be Crazy II’ didn’t not connect with audiences the way its predecessor did. The film’s run in theaters was brief, earning less than $10 million worldwide.</p>

      <h4>'The Sting II' (1983)</h4>
      <p>The first 'Sting' film paired Hollywood icons Robert Redford and Paul Newman. The sequel had Jackie Gleason and country singer Mac Davis. That probably says everything you need to know about the quality-drop in ‘The Sting II.’ Among the many harsh reviews, the 'New York Times' said the sequel “moves slowly, looks terrible and copies the first film shamelessly.” While the first film won seven Academy Awards and would later be selected for preservation by the Library of Congress, its successor was an unabashed failure. ‘The Sting II’ would later boast a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

      <h4>'Meatballs Part II' (1984)</h4>
      <p>No Bill Murray. No Harold Ramis. No Ivan Reitman. And no laughs. 'Meatballs Part II' was the classic example of an '80s sequel that studio heads insisted on making despite obvious pitfalls. The film was panned by critics and earned only $5 million at the box office, roughly 1/8 of the amount its predecessor took in.</p>
