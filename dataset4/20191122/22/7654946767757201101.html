      <p>Real-life “Buffalo Soldiers” — military police mounted on gigantic water buffalo — routinely patrol the streets of the Brazilian island of Marajo, to the delight of tourists and Bob Marley fans.</p>
      <p>The photo of these two soldiers and their steeds was snapped by photographer Fernando Camara on a recent sightseeing jaunt.</p>
      <p>It’s traditional for Marajo’s military police to ride the docile, 1,000-pound creatures, he told Caters News.</p>
      <p>Marajo, an island the size of Switzerland off Brazil’s northern coast, has some 450,000 domesticated and feral water buffalo — more animals than people. When they’re not carrying soldiers around, they haul farm equipment and provide milk, meat and hides.</p>
      <p>“It has become a bit of a tourist attraction,” Camara said. “But it was started with the objectives of reinforcing safety and maintaining the culture of the local population.”</p>
      <p>Whether the two buffalo soldiers photographed were also, in fact, dreadlocked rastas could not be immediately determined.</p>
