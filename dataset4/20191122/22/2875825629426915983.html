      <h2>The I'm A Celebrity 2019 stars finally got to meet former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi, except they'd rather had been given a treat</h2>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity campmates including Ian Wright and James Haskell weren't exactly thrilled when they got to rescue new arrival Cliff Parisi from jungle jail.</p>
      <p>Cliff was probably hoping that they'd be glad to see him, as he finally got to join the main camp.</p>
      <p>He left behind fellow newcomer Andy Whyment, as well as Kate Garraway, Andrew Maxwell, and new prisoners Jacqueline Jossa and Myles Stephenson.</p>
      <p>But if the campers back in the main camp had it their way, Cliff would have remained in jail in exchange for some goodies.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner joined James in the latest Dingo Dollar Challenge, giving them the option to win something nice.</p>

      <p>However, as they headed to Kiosk Kev's shack they were stunned to find out that instead of crisps, chocolate or another tasty snack, it was a person they could win.</p>
      <p>They had the option of saving Cliff or Andy from prison, with it clear they would have preferred a snack.</p>
      <p>James joked: "I tell you what, I’d rather a bag of crisps or chocolate bar if I’m completely honest with you."</p>

      <p>Caitlyn responded: "I don’t know these Brits, how can I make a decision,” not clear on who either of the newbies were.</p>
      <p>James made the decision, saying: "I don’t know these guys but I know Cliff played Minty in EastEnders and I’ve got a really good friend called Minty."</p>
      <p>As they headed back to camp to announce the news, Cliff was informed of the decision back at the prison.</p>

      <p>Ahead of his arrival, those waiting for him at Main Camp couldn't hide their slight disappointment as they'd hoped for chocolate.</p>
      <p>It was a little while before they got over it, with Cliff soon arriving and receiving a warm welcome.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle later confessed in the Bush Telegraph: "I felt sorry for Cliff as there was high hopes for a phone call and come chocolate and then Cliff came which was great but I think there was a ‘oh, they’re back and they’ve not got any chocolate’."</p>
