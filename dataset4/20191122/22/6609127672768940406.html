      <p>But the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/3952080/laura-muir-athletics-glasgow-chippy/">Perth-born runner</a>, who is expecting her first child with hubby Brian in January, said she wouldn’t survive as a rookie now because of online trolls.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/2450144/eilidh-doyle-team-scotland-flag-bearer/">Eilidh</a> said: “Everybody has different figures but you are wearing small shorts and a crop top, so your figures are on display and it can be difficult.</p>
      <p>"It’s inevitable image can play a factor but I think with social media it’s very difficult.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of people on Twitter who want to say nasty things.</p>
      <p>“I started my career when social media wasn’t really big. If I was a 22-year-old starting out now would I stay in the sport?”</p>
      <p>Eilidh, who won relay bronze at Rio 2016, said she had sponsorship cut when she turned 30.</p>
      <p>She added: “Before, deals were based on your ability. Now it is based on how many followers you’ve got on Twitter or how good you look in the kit.”</p>
