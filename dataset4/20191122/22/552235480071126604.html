      <h1>Alex Rae in Rangers investment claim as he predicts January cash boost at Ibrox</h1>
      <h2>The former Light Blues midfielder insists there will be an influx of money arriving at the club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:26:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:26</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Alex Rae claims there will be major investment coming into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> in January and the club will not be forced to sell the likes of Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>The former Light Blues midfielder insists there is a cash injection on the horizon after the club announced they needed £10million before the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The figures released earlier this month stated Rangers had suffered an annual loss of £11.3m resulting in claims the club would resort to cashing in on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Rangers boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> and sporting director <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-wilson">Ross Wilson</a> insisted the Colombian striker will be going nowhere in the upcoming transfer window.</p>

      <p>And Rae believes that will be the case as Rangers will receive the required funds from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He said on Clyde 1's Superscoreboard: "Now it is my understanding at the turn of the year there will be another share issue done, which will provide considerable money.</p>
      <p>"And there will be major investment coming into Rangers."</p>
      <p>Host Gordon Duncan probed Rae, saying: "We have heard this stuff quite a lot though, haven't we?"</p>
      <p>Rae added: "I've heard it from a very high source in Ibrox so I would prefer to believe that instead of anybody from Twitter."</p>
