      <h1>Ultra-Orthodox Jews fight domestic violence in Israel</h1>

      <p>Kfar Saba, Israel:  If you are scared, that is not shlom bayit," reads the slogan that Esty Shushan hopes will encourage religious Jewish Israeli women like her to leave violent marriages.</p>
      <p>The phrase, which literally translates as "peaceful home", is vitally important in Judaism -- meaning an obligation to protect the unity of the family.</p>
      <p>Shushan, 42, is making sure to frame her organisation's campaign in the language of her ultra-Orthodox community, which makes up around 10 percent of Israel's population.</p>
      <p>Seven years ago, driven by high levels of gender inequality in her community, Shushan co-founded an association to improve ultra-Orthodox women's visibility and political representation.</p>
      <p>Called Nivcharot, meaning "The Chosen", it now has around 15,000 supporters.</p>
      <p>Ultra-Orthodox Jews live in close-knit communities often closed off to the wider world, with patriarchal family structures common.</p>
      <p>Shushan and her colleagues hope that ultra-Orthodox women will be more comfortable opening up to others from their own community.</p>
      <p>In a room in an educational centre in the city of Kfar Saba north of Tel Aviv in central Israel, they meet to finalise their new campaign.</p>
      <p>Hair hidden under hats or wigs, they wear long clothes that cover their elbows and knees, preserving their modesty in the traditional way for ultra-Orthodox Jews.</p>
      <p>Over pizza and soft drinks, they strategise how best to encourage victims to speak out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rabbi first</b>
      </p>
      <p>Violence against women occurs throughout Israeli society, said Mally Shechory Bitton, a couples therapist and professor at Ariel University in the Israeli settlement of Ariel in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>But in ultra-Orthodox communities there is also a taboo on discussing it, she said, with a feeling that you "shouldn't wash your dirty linen in public".</p>
      <p>"Orthodox women turn to the rabbi before turning to the police, which also makes the phenomenon of domestic violence difficult to quantify," she said.</p>
      <p>Abuse is not only physical but can be psychological, sexual and even economic, she added.</p>
      <p>In ultra-Orthodox communities, men tend to focus only on reading sacred Jewish texts, often relying on women to earn a salary.</p>
      <p>Despite this, sometimes "women have their credit cards taken by their husbands," Shechory Bitton said.</p>
      <p>Attitudes have evolved, however, and two shelters for abused religious women have opened in recent years.</p>
      <p>"Awareness is growing but it is still not enough," Shechory Bitton said.</p>
      <p>Back in Kfar Saba, Shushan and her colleagues hunch over a computer selecting images to distribute for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25.</p>
      <p>They are careful to maintain conservative social norms, and avoid images directly depicting gender-based violence.</p>
      <p>Instead they choose a photo of drink spilled on a white tablecloth accompanied by the shlom bayit slogan, hinting at violence during the traditional weekly Shabbat dinner.</p>
      <p>Shushan hopes the campaign can educate women "not to stay in unhealthy relationships".</p>
      <p>Raheli Morgenstern, 31, another member of the organisation, said religious women are taught from an early age the importance of the sanctity of the home.</p>
      <p>This can lead, she said, to abused women staying silent over fears of ostracisation or "shame".</p>
      <p>"Marriage is sacred for Jews and the ultra-Orthodox in particular, but you shouldn't stay married at any cost," she said.</p>
      <p>Morgenstern says divorce, even if it is permitted under Jewish law, often has "a very, very high price," with ultra-Orthodox women who pursue separation often excluded from their community.</p>
      <p>Nivcharot's campaign will be shared on Whatsapp and social media.</p>
      <p>Contrary to the popular belief that the internet is taboo for ultra-Orthodox Jews, about 40 percent of the community in Israel have online access, fellow member Hila Hassan Lefkowitz said, citing studies she has read.</p>
      <p>For all their planning, they have modest hopes for the campaign, Morgenstern said.</p>
      <p>Even if they only encourage one woman to end an abusive relationship, she said, "it would be enough".</p>
