      <p>The Powell River Kings used a familiar ingredient to down the Victoria Grizzlies on Friday night.</p>
      <p>When the Kings scored first this season they were 9-0. You can make it 10-0 as Powell River scored three minutes into the B.C. Hockey League game at Hap Parker Arena and then cruised to a 5-2 victory over the visiting Grizzlies. The win moved the Kings (12-14) eight points clear of the Island Division last-place Grizzlies (8-20). The two teams will meet again today at 5 p.m. at Hap Parker.</p>
      <p>Ben Wozney beat Grizzlies rookie netminder Blake Wood at 3:09 mark and three minutes later the Kings struck again with Hunter McCoy picking up his seventh goal of the season, and Powell River was on its way to its second straight victory.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies, coming off a 6-3 win over the last-place Merritt Centennials last Saturday, have now lost eight of their last nine games.</p>
      <p>Trailing 5-0 going into the third period, the Grizzlies used their power play to get back in the game. Blue-liner James Davenport buried a nice feed from Brendan Bowie four minutes into the final frame, while Cody Monds beat Kings netminder Derek Krall on a Victoria 5-on-3 man advantage to give the Grizzlies some late life.</p>
      <p>Jack Bracket, Reilly Moran and Nic Porchetta had the other Kings goals.</p>
      <p>Wood made 23 saves on the night, while Krall turned aside 23 Grizzlies’ shots.</p>
      <p>LOOSE PUCKS: The Grizzlies were again without injured goaltender Liam Souliere, defenceman Brady MacDonald and forward Eddie Yan. . . . Following tonight’s game, the Grizzlies return home for consecutive games against the Cowichan Valley Capitals on Tuesday and Friday at The Q Centre.</p>
