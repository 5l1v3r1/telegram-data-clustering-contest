      <h1>Colorblind student gets to see color for the first time in touching video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:13:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/viral">viral </a>video of a young <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/education">student </a>getting the chance to see the world in color for the first time is warming the hearts of the internet.</p>
      <p>The video, posted on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter">Twitter </a>by the boy’s brother Ben Jones, shows the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing/color-blindness">colorblind </a>student, Jonathan Jones, sitting in a classroom during a course about the visual deficit.</p>
      <p>The school principal, who is also colorblind, is instructing the class of students before he hands Jonathan a pair of glasses.</p>

      <p>“They’re all yours,” the principal said.</p>
      <p>Within seconds, Jonathan is able to see the room in color. He immediately grins from ear to ear, and moments later, he begins to cry tears of joy.</p>

      <p>The emotional moment compels the principal to give Jonathan a hug. He is also embraced by his mom, on hand to witness the first-time experience.</p>
      <p>Jonathan then walks over to a periodic table of elements and other colored demonstrations on the wall to take in their beauty.</p>
      <p>Turns out the glasses that Jonathan borrowed are pretty costly – upward of $350.</p>
      <p>After the video’s viral popularity online, Jonathan’s mother created a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sp7m4-color-blind-glasses?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet">GoFundMe</a> page to help raise money to get him a pair.</p>

      <p>“After posting a video on social media of Jonathan seeing color for the first time, we have been overwhelmed by how many kind, generous people have wanted to help him get a pair of his own color blind glasses,” his mother, Carole Walter Jones, wrote.</p>
      <p>“We will use these funds to purchase his own pair and donate any additional funds to a foundation who purchases color blind glasses for those who can't afford them.</p>
      <p>“Thank you all for your love and compassion. We are overwhelmed and encouraged to know there are so many amazing people in this world who would help a young man they have never met.”</p>
      <p>The Jones family successfully hit that $350 goal and then some. In total, the fundraiser earned over $6,700.</p>
