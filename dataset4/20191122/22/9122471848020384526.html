      <h1>Ohio State vs. Penn State Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:35:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Arguably the biggest game of the college football weekend will kick off from Columbus on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in the biggest game of the Big Ten season thus far. The Buckeyes have a clear path to the College Football Playoff, if they can take down the Nittany Lions tomorrow. However, Penn State can insert itself back into the playoff conversation with a huge upset win over Ohio State as well.</p>
      <p>Ryan Day and company are the No. 2 team in the nation, but rank first in offense and defense. They can finally prove they’re the top team in the country by demolishing a very capable Penn State team.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know about the Big Ten clash:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>FOX</p>
      <p><b>Spread: </b>Ohio State -18.5</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>57.5</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Gus Johnson, Joel Klatt, Jenny Taft</p>
      <p>Ohio State enters as a heavy favorite. However, if the last three games between these two teams are any indication, it should be closer than the experts think.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes have won each of the past two games by a total of two points. Penn State took down Ohio State in 2016, by just three points.</p>
      <p>Can the Nittany Lions keep this one close?</p>
