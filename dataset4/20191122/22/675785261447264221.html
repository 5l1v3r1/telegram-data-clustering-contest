      <h1>RFL boss Ralph Rimmer dismisses calls for inquiry into events at Bradford Bulls</h1>
      <h2>Rimmer insists the last two years have not been a "disaster" despite the Bulls running up significant debt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Walker, https://www.facebook.com/GarethWalkerMirror/</a></address>
      <p>RFL boss Ralph Rimmer has dismissed calls for a public inquiry into Bradford Bulls’ change in ownership, insisting the last two years have not been a “disaster”.</p>
      <p>Former RFL chief executive Nigel Wood is part of a consortium that has taken control of the four-time Super League champions. The change in ownership comes after a series of financial meltdowns that have included three administrations and a liquidation since 2012.</p>
      <p>Accounts revealed the Bulls ran up over £1million of debt in the two years under previous owner,  New Zealander Andrew Chalmers, a friend of Wood. Chalmers was handed control of the Bulls by the RFL in 2017, ahead of other prospective bidders, while Wood was in charge at rugby league’s governing body.</p>
      <p>The issue is further complicated by the fact that Wood was also at the helm of the RFL when they bought the lease for Odsal stadium in 2011, something they still own even though the Bulls  will play at Dewsbury in 2020 due to rising costs.</p>

      <p>But Rimmer maintains that a public inquiry into the goings on at the Bulls would serve little purpose. He said: “We've got an independent board - that's what they're there for. What's point of having inquiry into an independent board?</p>
      <p>“They’re there to make decisions which are non-conflicting in best interests of the sport. The independent board is there to govern and if we have inquiries into them, where does it end? It could paralyse the sport completely.”</p>
      <p>Addressing the issue of handing control of the Bulls to Chalmers while Wood was at the helm of the RFL, Rimmer added: “A full board made that decision.</p>

      <p>“Based on the information we had in 2017, we chose what we felt was the best bid to set up a new club in Bradford.</p>
      <p>“There's been no insolvency this time, it's the same entity as it was in 2017. That ownership have weathered a significant storm and this company is still trading.</p>
      <p>“This has not been a disaster. The club didn't exist two years ago. They've been relegated and then promoted, beaten Leeds, had a transfer of ownership, got a substantial crowd against Leeds. That isn't a nightmare.”</p>
