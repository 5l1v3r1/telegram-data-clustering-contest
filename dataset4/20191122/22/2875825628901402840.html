      <h1>Jose Mourinho responds to claims he needs money for success after taking Tottenham job</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese coach has spent more money than any other manager whilst in charge of some of Europe's top clubs, but has taken over a side under the frugal watch of Daniel Levy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Eyes widening, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> couldn’t believe the question.</p>
      <p>“I’m a good guy. Come on!” he pleaded, arms outstretched, palms up.</p>
      <p>“People cannot wish that I fail. If you are a fan of another club, I understand that, but general people? I’m a good guy. Come on! Give me a break.”</p>
      <p>But over the last 15 years or so, the 56-year-old Portuguese will be well aware he has had his critics as well as admirers.</p>
      <p>Some don’t care for the circus around him, others dislike his confidence that comes with winning the title in four different countries and the Champions League in two.</p>
      <p>On this, his third return to English football, Mourinho’s critics won’t just be fans of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , Spurs, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>

      <p>This time he could even have enemies within. Many Spurs fans are still upset at losing Mauricio Pochettino, the head coach who did more for them than anyone in the modern era.</p>
      <p>Pochettino did not pick fights or aim jibes at rivals. He blooded – and backed – a string of young players. His ‘magic’ relationship with the Spurs faithful will not be erased by a few decent results.</p>
      <p>It means that when Mourinho kicks off this lunchtime at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , he must hit the ground running to prove he can still make the impact that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola have had at Liverpool and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> – and he had initially at Chelsea and Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>“Maybe it’s my fault,” he said, “Maybe it’s also the profile of club I normally get. It’s like you people say, I always need money to spend with players.</p>

      <p>“It’s not me, it’s my clubs. It’s the profile of the club, it’s the profile of the owner, the profile of, let’s say, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> . Certain profile of players.”</p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be delighted at having sent the profile of Spurs through the roof by hiring Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese in turn praised his boss, insisting other clubs hold Levy in high esteem.</p>
      <p>“I used to be in clubs that fear him,” he said. “It’s true. He’s powerful. He’s a businessman, but he’s a football man.</p>

      <p>“He has big experience, a part of his intelligence overall, he’s a football man, he understands football, he understands the industry, he understands the evolution, he’s very clever, he’s very intelligent, it’s great to have him on my side.”</p>
      <p>With that in mind, Mourinho is confident he will not have the battle over his job title that ultimately consumed Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“In reality, who is the manager of any football club?” He said. “We are part of a structure. But what I am is the head coach.</p>
      <p>“Nobody will decide which team is going to play. Nobody’s going to decide when I’m going to train. Nobody is going to decide when I give a day off. That’s my responsibility.</p>
      <p>“But if you think in modern football, that you are the whole all-powerful, you are in trouble.”</p>
      <p>Instead of politics, Mourinho is focused on the pitch and has reiterated his call for his players to show no fear as they target silverware and a winning mentality.</p>
      <p>“With the squad we have and the quality of the whole structure of the club, we can have the same ambitions as they have at clubs that are bigger than us,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want my players to fear anything. We go for everything against everybody.”</p>
