      <p>OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Thomas Chabot had a goal and an assist, Anders Nilsson stopped 30 shots, and the Ottawa Senators beat the New York Rangers 4-1 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Logan Brown, Tyler Ennis and Anthony Duclair also scored for the Senators, who have their first three-game winning streak of the season. Nilsson has won his last four starts at home while allowing just five goals in that stretch.</p>
      <p>Jacob Trouba scored for the Rangers, and Henrik Lundqvist finished with 35 saves.</p>
      <p>Ottawa got off to a fast start, scoring twice in the first 6 1/2 minutes. Chabot got the Senators going just 57 seconds in with his first goal in 17 games, and Brown scored on the power play at 6:32 for his first NHL goal.</p>
      <p>Trouba got the Rangers on the scoreboard with a shot from inside the blue line that took a bounce that fooled Nilsson with 2:40 left in the opening period.</p>
      <p>Ottawa continued to control the pace of the game for much of the second period. Ennis gave the Senators a 3-1 lead at 1:11 as he fought his way to the net and beat Lundqvist with a wrist shot.</p>
      <p>After failing to score on two power plays, including a double-minor Ottawa’s Christian Jaros, the Rangers got into penalty trouble themselves.</p>
      <p>Ottawa had a two-man advantage, and Lundqvist made three big saves, but was then beat by Duclair with 6:36 remaining. .</p>
      <p>The Senators had another two-man advantage 16 seconds later, but were unable to beat Lundqvist again.</p>
      <p>NOTES: This was the third and final meeting between the two teams this season. The Rangers won the first meeting, 4-1 here on Oct. 5, and the Senators won 6-2 at New York on Nov. 4. … Ottawa recalled Max Lajoie and Jaros from Belleville of the AHL as it deals with injuries on the blue line. … Lundqvist remained in a tie with Curtis Joseph for fifth place on the NHL’s goalie wins list at 454.</p>
