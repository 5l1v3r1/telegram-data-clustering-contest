      <h1>Pep Guardiola responds to claims he will quit Man City at the end of the season</h1>
      <h2>Reports have claimed that Guardiola could walk away from the Etihad at the end of the season but he has hit back and says he is there to stay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has rubbished the notion he could walk away from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at the end of this season.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is contracted until the end of the 2020-21 season and said he will see out his current deal, even if City fail to make it a hat-trick of Premier League titles.</p>
      <p>The back-to-back champions are currently in fourth place, nine points behind leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , following a 3-1 defeat at Anfield before the international break.</p>
      <p>That, and the fact Guardiola’s wife has returned to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> to live with one of their three children, raised the prospect of the 48-year-old bringing to a premature end his time in Manchester.</p>
      <p>But Guardiola, whose side host <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> today, said he will be at City next season and will not take the easy option of quitting, just because the going gets tough.</p>

      <p>“If people ask if I want to stay? I want to stay,” said Guardiola. “I don’t have any reasons to move from here.</p>
      <p>“I’m incredibly satisfied to work with this club, with these players, and if people think I’m going to resign or be sacked for these results and nine points behind, people don’t know me.</p>
      <p>“I like to be in this challenge, I love to be in this position. And, if the club wants me next season, I want to be here, 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>“I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and I want to work and live with them and I want to be here.</p>
      <p>“But if they decide the results are getting worse, they’re going to take a decision, that’s normal.</p>
      <p>“It’s not because I am friends with Txiki [Begiristain, sporting director] that I’m going to stay for the rest of my life. I’m here because I win.</p>

      <p>“If I don’t win, I’m in trouble, I know that, but I’m incredibly satisfied to work in this city and this club and I want to help this club to get better.</p>
      <p>“I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer. If the club wants, I will stay.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola acknowledged City face a huge task in making up a nine-point deficit on Liverpool, but insisted he will not walk away if they fail to do so.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have a joker in our pocket,” said Guardiola. “Nine points against this team is - I know from all around the world the Premier League is done.</p>
      <p>“So if that happens, we’ll try again next season and my players will be there. We have two options – give up or don’t give up.</p>
      <p>“Maybe we won’t win, but we’re not going to give up.”</p>
