      <p>Bloomberg's chief economist said on Friday that he believes China can manage the economic slowdown, and that the country's services industry has a larger role to play.<br/><br/>Speaking on the sidelines of the 2019 New Economy Forum (NEF) in Beijing, Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg, said "China's economic structure has changed, and there's a larger role for services, which means [it] can have stable employment even as growth slows."<br/><br/>He added that the recent slowdown is "certainly not good news for those other countries that benefit from China's growth."<br/><br/>A recent Bloomberg report on the new economy drivers and disrupters shows China ranked fourth in the drivers' sector and 50th in the disrupters' sector.<br/><br/>Orlik told the Global Times on Friday that the determinants of economic competitiveness have changed in the new economy. <br/><br/>China has advantages in the old determinants, but also faces challenges from disruptive forces, including protectionism and climate change, Orlik said. <br/><br/>Orlik also warned of the impact on world economy from the trade war. <br/><br/>"The pace of the global growth has halved and a big reason for that is the trade war," he said.<br/><br/>According to Orlik, if a phase-one trade deal is reached, the US and China would both benefit significantly.</p>
