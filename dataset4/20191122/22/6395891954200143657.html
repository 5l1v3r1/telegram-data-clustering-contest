      <p><b>NAPLES, Fla. (AP)</b> - Sei Young Kim wasted two good birdie chances late in the second round Friday when she got a pep talk from an unlikely source.</p>
      <p>Cristie Kerr was working as a commentator for Golf Channel, and on the long walk to the 18th tee, she told Kim that a strong finish in the CME Group Tour Championship would make dinner that much better.</p>
      <p>"I just said, ‘Yeah, I'm going to make the birdie.' Yeah, it come true," Kim said.</p>
      <p>She fired a 6-iron to the perfect spot in the middle of the green and watched it roll toward the back pin until stopping less than 2 feet away. Kim tapped in for a birdie and a 5-under 67, keeping her lead at two shots in the chase for the richest prize in women's golf.</p>
      <p>Kim has made only one bogey over two rounds at Tiburon Golf Club and was at 12-under 132.</p>
      <p>Everyone around her had far more excitement, not all of it good.</p>
      <p>Caroline Masson of Germany atoned for missing a birdie chance on the par-5 17th by rolling in a 40-foot birdie putt from off the green and through the shadows on the final hole for a 66 that closed the gap to one shot until Kim finished with her birdie.</p>
      <p>They will be in the final group on Saturday, moving closer to a shot at the $1.5 million to the winner.</p>
      <p>Brooke Henderson of Canada began her second round with a double bogey on the par-5 opening hole. She finished much better, with five birdies over her final seven holes that put her squarely back into the mix with a 67, leaving her three shots behind.</p>
      <p>Henderson has a home not far from Naples and gets a big following, many of them Canadians in Florida for the winter.</p>
      <p>"Great crowd, great energy out here," Henderson said. "I'm excited to be playing the weekend near the top of the leaderboard, so it should be fun."</p>
      <p>Also three shots back was Nelly Korda, the top American in the women's world ranking at No. 3, who didn't finish so well.</p>
      <p>Korda provided the biggest challenge to Kim all day, firing darts into the seventh and ninth greens for short birdie putts that gave her a 31 on the front nine and gave her a one-shot lead.</p>
      <p>Korda was one shot behind when she missed a birdie putt on the par-3 16th, and then shockingly missed the 2-foot par putt.</p>
      <p>"It's not going to be the last putt I miss," Korda said. "It's just how it is."</p>
      <p>Looking to get a shot back on the 17th, Korda instead hit a hard hook off the tee beyond the cart path and through the dirt until it came to rest under a tree.</p>
      <p>"May be been a little ticked off," Korda said with a grin. "I did snipe it left into the trees."</p>
      <p>She had no choice but to pitch back to the fairway and did well to give herself a birdie chance with a shot into about 15 feet, only to miss it. She made par on the final hole for a 68.</p>
      <p>Su Oh of Australia had a 67 and was four behind, while the group five back included defending champion Lexi Thompson and Jessica Korda, both with 67s.</p>
      <p>The format for the season finale changed this year, from only the top 12 in the Race to CME Globe have a chance at the $1 million bonus to all 60 players in the field winning $1.5 million in official money just by winning the tournament.</p>
      <p>Friday was critical not to lose much ground.</p>
      <p>Jin Young Ko, who received her award Thursday as LPGA player of the year, shot a 69 and remained eight shots behind. Jeongeun Lee6, the U.S. Women's Open champion, felt a burden lifted and shot 67. She had six birdies, twice as many as the first round.</p>
      <p>The burden had nothing to do with the big prize. Lee6 was rookie of the year, and she gave a moving speak in English before a full banquet room and without notes, having rehearsed it for two months. She received the loudest ovation of the night.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people this morning were cheering and then they were congratulating me and then they saw that, ‘Oh, she did really well with the speech,' and I felt really good about it," Lee6 said. "And I felt like really good feelings about today, so my shots and my putting were good so far. But I kind of want to try my best I can for the last two rounds."</p>
