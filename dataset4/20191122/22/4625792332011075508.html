      <h1>Nike 'Salute to Service' gear features every NFL team name except Redskins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:58:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:58</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Pearce</a></address>
      <p>The NFL's "Salute to Service" gear to honor military veterans featured the names of every team in the league this year except for the Washington Redskins.</p>
      <p>Every year, during the month of November, each of the league's 32 teams devotes one game to military servicemen and veterans. Nike makes specially branded gear for each team to go along with the salute.</p>
      <p>Almost every team's gear in the 2019 line follows the same formula for branding featuring the city the team is located in, followed by the team's name with two exceptions: the Oakland Raiders and the Washington Redskins.</p>
      <p>On the Raider’s gear, the city of Oakland is omitted, and the gear says, "Raiders Football." In the case of the Redskins, the team name is omitted, and the gear says, "Washington Football."</p>

      <p>The omissions only appear on Nike’s "Salute to Service" line and not on any of their other NFL products.</p>
      <p>"This would be a question for Nike," Redskins representative Sean DeBarbieri <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/11/20/no-one-seems-to-know-why-the-redskins-name-wasnt-on-their-salute-to-service-hoodies/">told</a> the <i>Washingtonian</i> when asked about the team's missing name. "They issue all of the NFL team gear."</p>
      <p>The Washington Redskins have faced calls to change the team name on the basis that it disparages Native Americans. Owner Dan Snyder, however, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/erik-brady/2018/05/09/dan-snyder-redskins-mascot-never-five-years-later/596491002/">has claimed</a>, "We’ll never change the name."</p>
      <p>Neither Nike nor the Oakland Raiders immediately returned <i>The Washington Examiner</i>'s request for comment.</p>
