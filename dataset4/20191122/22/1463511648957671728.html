      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:53:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author">Dotun Oladipo</a></address>
      <p>Nigerian comedian, actor and film producer, Ayodeji Richard Makun, aka AY, has bagged a deal with the Huawen Movie group in China to collaborate on the making of his next project: “30 Days.”</p>
      <p>This would be the first deal championed by AY in collaboration with Chinese film industry and Nigerian Nollywood industry.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post by AY: @aycomedian, who was recently in China, the film producer and actor revealed that he had a meeting with executives of Huawen Movie Group.</p>
      <p>He captioned the picture of himself at the Chinese office of the media group, where he wrote: “We are looking at a brighter future for Nollywood.”</p>
      <p>He said he was joined on the journey by Mr. Wang, Chairman Huahua Media, and Moses Babatope of Filmone Entertainment.</p>
      <p>In a chat with CNN Africa, Babatope said the Chinese collaboration will open up Nollywood to Chinese cinema audience and create better quality movies.</p>
      <p>“We will be exposed to a worthwhile and moving Chinese film market. It’s like skipping many hurdles and getting access to an existing mature market,” Babatope said.</p>
      <p>AY’s entry into Nollywood was with the production of “30 Days in Atlanta.”</p>
      <p>The production, shot in collaboration with the Atlanta Government, was an epic that paved the way for Nigerian comic films in cinemas.</p>
      <p>“30 Days in China” joins Makun’s comedy franchise, which includes “30 days in Atlanta” and “10 days in Sun City,” where he films adventures in new countries.</p>
