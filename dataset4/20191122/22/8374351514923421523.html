      <p>Conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) has taken another major step in the area of sustainability, by laying the first recycled plastics road in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Asphalt using plastics were laid on a 1,500-square meter pilot test site at a new logistics center in General Trias, Cavite. The test site was chosen as it will be used primarily as a marshalling area for trucks with heavy loads, including 18-wheelers, and heavy equipment.</p>
      <p>SMC president Ramon S. Ang said: “What we want to achieve is to help address an important environmental issue, and that is plastic wastes. We want to create a sustainable use for waste plastics so that they don’t end up in landfills and our rivers and oceans.”</p>
      <p>Some 900 kilos of plastic waste, equivalent to some 180,000 sachets and plastic bags, were used for the test site.</p>
      <p>SMC’s technology partner, global materials science company Dow, said that recycled plastic waste acts as a binder together with bitumen, in the production of asphalt.</p>
      <p>The company said that using recycled plastics in the production process can help make roads longer lasting and more durable compared to conventional asphalt.<br/>Independent lab testing done on San Miguel’s recycled plastics road asphalt shows that it exceeds the standards of the Department of Public Works and Highways.</p>
      <p>The company said that pending further testing, it can build recycled plastics roads in its facilities as well as major infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p>Last week, San Miguel also announced that it is adopting the use of biodegradable plastics for food and non-food products.</p>
      <p>For this, the company is utilizing the biodegradable plastics developed by Philippine Bioresins Corporation that can be 64.65 percent degraded in 24 months as compared to non-biodegradable plastics (4.5 percent in 24 months).</p>
