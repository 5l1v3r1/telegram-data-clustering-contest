      <h1>AFRIMA: Stakeholders urge artistes to utilise digital platforms for distribution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:39:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Stakeholders in the music industry on Friday urged musicians to utilise available digital platforms to distribute their works.</p>
      <p>The stakeholders said this at the African Music Business Summit, themed: “Music Business in Africa: Connecting Borderless Talents.”</p>
      <p>The summit, which is one of the events lined up for the All Africa Music Awards, had the stakeholders discussing African Music and Digital Influence.</p>
      <p>Yoel Kenan, CEO AFRICORI, said digital distribution connects independent artistes directly with the audience and the world at large.</p>
      <p>Kenan said: “Digital platform enables artistes to reach new targets around the world.</p>
      <p>“If more artistes can key into this, I see a lot of opportunities happening in Nigeria music industry.</p>
      <p>“Today, you can be independent as an artiste.</p>
      <p>“A number of artists do not need a record label because music distribution is now easier and you can have your songs available all over the world through digital platforms.”</p>
      <p>Eric Bellamy, Associate Director, YUMA Productions, said a lot of artistes could utilise the digital platform to the extent that one or two good songs can earn them a tour.</p>
      <p>Bellamy said: “With digital distribution of music, the rules have now changed.</p>
      <p>“The audience are on all social media platforms, just log in and connect with them.</p>
      <p>“It is also important for artistes to choose where they intend to focus their strategy.</p>
      <p>“Burna Boy chose UK and it worked for him.”</p>
      <p>The founder, Society for the Performing Arts in Nigeria, Sarah Boulos, said the digital way is the only way a musician’s message can go further.</p>
      <p>Boulos added that the digital platform is also having a negative effect on the life act as consumers now easily enjoy music at their comfort zones without stepping out.</p>
      <p>Boulos said the digital platform had given opportunity to women in the music industry to sell their music and urged popular artistes to also support young talents.</p>
      <p>Seidu Iddrisu, a music publisher, however, said artistes needed to be enlightened on royalty payment, which is a continental problem in music distribution.</p>
      <p>Iddrisu said: “Artistes should come out with a split immediately a song is made.</p>
      <p>“This split will be among all those that contributed to the production of the song.</p>
      <p>“This will put an end to dispute over royalty payments.</p>
      <p>“A lot of artistes have their royalty payments hanging somewhere because they had no understanding of this, which is sad.”</p>
      <p>Sipho Diamini, Managing Director, Universal Music, who was the moderator, further encouraged both up and coming and A list artistes to utilise digital platforms effectively.</p>
      <p>Diamini emphasised the importance of consistency and advised them to study successful artistes with the intention of learning from their strategy.</p>
