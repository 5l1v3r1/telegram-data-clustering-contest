      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kathie-lee-gifford-kissing-man-nashville">Kathie Lee Gifford</a> has a lot to be thankful for as the calendar approaches <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/holiday">Thanksgiving</a>.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old stopped by the "<a href="https://www.today.com/video/kathie-lee-gifford-stops-by-the-3rd-hour-of-today-talks-daughter-cassidy-s-engagement-73883205862">3rd Hour of Today</a>” on Friday, while the show was filming near her new hometown in Nashville, and Gifford couldn’t help but share her excitement about both of her kids <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kathie-lee-gifford-daughter-cassidy-engaged">getting engaged</a> in the same year.</p>
      <p>“The good news is I adore both of their partners,” Gifford gushed of her soon-to-be in-laws.</p>

      <p>The proud mother went on to say that she knows her late husband, NFL icon Frank Gifford -- who died in August 2015 at age 84 -- is sharing the same excitement as he smiles down on his children, daughter Cassidy and son Cody.</p>

      <p>"It’s a new season, and I know Frank is smiling,” she said. “He might have even had a little something to do with it.”</p>
      <p>The former “Today” show host took to Instagram on Sunday to announce Cassidy’s engagement to Ben Wierda and noted she was “beyond the moon and stars.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you, LORD!” she continued.</p>
      <p>When asked if she’d be singing at her kids’ weddings, Gifford quipped: “They don't want me to sing. Nobody wants me to sing.”</p>
      <p>As for <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kathie-lee-gifford-nashville-move-loneliness">becoming a Nashville native</a>, the newly-minted local continued to rave about the place she now calls home in her semi-retirement.</p>

      <p>“I just love it here. It's a place of joy for me,” she explained. “The culture has gotten kind of dark a lot of places in the country and every time I was working on a movie here, and all the music here, and every time I’d get on the plane to go back home, I’d say, why am I so happy here, and I realized it's because it's a culture of kindness here…I felt loved here and received and respected.” </p>
