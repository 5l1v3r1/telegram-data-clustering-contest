      <p>I’m A Celebrity viewers couldn’t control their laughter after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> was filmed falling out of a window.</p>
      <p>Don’t worry, it’s not as dramatic as it sounds – although the clip does get funnier the more times you watch it.</p>
      <p>The Olympic champion was taking part in a bushtucker trial with her fellow campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a>, which saw the duo take on an escape room challenge filled with critters.</p>
      <p>After successfully unlocking the code to get to the money, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star could be heard telling her buddy: ‘Let’s get the money and get out of here.’</p>
      <p>After stuffing the coins into her bag, the A-listers ran towards the window where they hoped to make a graceful escape.</p>

      <p>However, it wasn’t graceful at all, as despite the rugby player giving the 70-year-old a leg up, she still managed to fall from the windowsill.</p>

      <p>Talking about the moment, the sportsman said: ‘We rummaged it like a couple of proper burglars, got the dingo dollars…’</p>
      <p>Trying not to laugh, he added: ‘Caitlyn fell out of the window… And I followed.’</p>
      <p>Back in the studio, Ant and Dec remained straight-faced as they told the viewers at home: ‘If you’re the kind of person who thinks watching Caitlyn Jenner fall out of a window is funny, then you’ll enjoy this action replay.’</p>

      <p>After watching the clip once more, Dec said: ‘It’s funnier the second time around.’</p>
      <p>However, he was keen to reassure everyone that Caitlyn was absolutely fine despite her slip.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, fans revealed how they’d been left in hysterics over the iconic moment.</p>
      <p>‘I’m crying at Caitlyn Jenner falling out that window,’ one wrote while another added: ‘Caitlyn falling out the window has got to be my highlight of this series so far tv gold.’</p>
      <p>Someone else said: ‘Replayed Caitlyn falling out the window like 5 times, thought I got over it, then they replayed it and I’m laughing all over again.’</p>
