      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t hold back on his usual criticism of traditional automakers as he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">unveiled Tesla’s long-awaited Cybertruck on Thursday</a>. But Ford doesn’t seem too scared.</p>
      <p>“Trucks have been the same for a very long time – like, 100 years,” Musk told the crowd at Tesla’s design center in Hawthorne, California. “We wanted to try something different.”</p>
      <p>After showing that the Tesla truck could withstand more damage from a sledgehammer than a regular truck’s door could, Musk said, “You want a truck that’s really tough, not fake tough.”</p>
      <p>That might be the case, but for Americans, the truck they’ve wanted for decades has been the Ford F-150.</p>
      <p>In response to Musk’s shade at it and other automakers, Ford sent the following statement:</p>
      <p>“With America’s best-selling truck for 42 years, we’ve always focused on serving our truck customers regardless of what others say or do. We look forward to our all-new F-150 hybrid coming next year and all-electric F-150 in a few years.”</p>
      <p>Musk has long expressed disdain for traditional automakers. And for the most part, he’s beat them at their own game, at least when it comes to electric vehicles. The Model 3 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-best-selling-ev-us-this-year-2019-7">was the best-selling electric vehicle in the US</a> in the first half of 2019, according to data from InsideEVs.</p>
      <p>Analysts estimated that Tesla could likely produce up to 175,000 Cybertrucks in its first full year of production in 2020. That’s a far cry from the roughly 1 million Ford F-150s sold every year.</p>
      <p>“In a nutshell, we believe this next generation Cybertruck model could help Tesla expand its market opportunity outside its core customer base over time,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said in a note to clients, adding that, however, “gaining market share with stalwarts such as Ford and GM entrenched in this landscape will be a difficult task for Fremont.”</p>
