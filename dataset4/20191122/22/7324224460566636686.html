      <h1>Slaven Bilic: Oli Burke has a future at West Brom</h1>
      <h2>Albion manager Slaven Bilic has insisted that he sees Oliver Burke's future at the club, despite the forward saying he doesn't feel part of the set-up at The Hawthorns.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:29:50+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The winger, currently on loan at Spanish side Alaves, recently said that he hopes his spell overseas will 'put him in the shop window' after not feeling a part of the club.</p>
      <p>Now, Bilic has said Burke is still in his plans if he can prove himself.</p>
      <p>"Of course (I see his future at Albion)," he said.</p>
      <p>"Same with (Jonathan) Leko, same with Sam Field, same with the players who went on loan.</p>
      <p>"For me it would be much easier to avoid this kind of situation when we have both left-backs out for a month, I could keep Burke if he was a left back, it would be easier to say 'you stay here', but that's not good for the player.</p>
      <p>"And it's not good long-term for the club.</p>
      <p>"That's why it's the same principle with Ollie, go there and prove yourself and come back and say you want to play here.</p>
      <p>"I can only talk about my time with him here, it was only a few weeks to be fair.</p>
      <p>"A good professional, he's got everything.</p>
      <p>"He shows you everything that he's got on paper, he shows you in training, (but) not consistent."</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old came through the youth ranks at Nottingham Forest, before making his name at German side Red Bull Leipzig.</p>
      <p>Since his Â£15 million move to the Black Country in 2017, Burke has only made 20 Baggies appearances and Bilic believes he needs to find some consistency.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to him and he's got a tag, big expectations and everything," he added.</p>
      <p>"For that he needs consistency, he needs minutes.</p>
      <p>"He needs to play week in, week out.</p>
      <p>"15 minutes or half an hour, I don't think it would break that barrier.</p>
      <p>"It's not necessarily that he's got it, but all the people that care about the club have that a little bit.</p>
      <p>"That affects the players of course.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to him and at that moment it was more likely that he will fight for his position.</p>
      <p>"Getting the minutes but not the games.</p>
      <p>"That wouldn't clear the situation for him.</p>
      <p>"I think that he has everything and we agreed to go somewhere to try to make his name in an environment that is not expecting from him straight away.</p>
      <p>"And then to come back to us, that was the plan."</p>
