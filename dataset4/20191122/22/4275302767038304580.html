      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn rules out new independence vote for ‘at least’ two years as he vows neutral Brexit stance</h1>
      <h2>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to remain neutral in a second Brexit referendum and block any new vote on Scottish independence for “at least” two years if he becomes prime minister.</h2>

      <p>Mr Corbyn told voters during a special leaders’ debate edition of Question Time he would adopt a “neutral stance” on a second Brexit vote – even if the remain option on the ballot was negotiated by his party.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said he would take the position so he could “bring communities and the country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit”.</p>
      <p>Scottish independence and post-election pacts were key themes as Mr Corbyn, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson and Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson faced a grilling from the public.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was forced to reject fears about anti-Semitism, misogyny and restrictions on freedom under his leadership, saying he had spent his career “getting into hot water for defending people because I believed their human rights should not be violated”.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon was next to face the studio audience and confirmed despite campaigning for a second Brexit vote, she would not want any future referendum on Scottish independence to be subject to a confirmatory ballot.</p>
      <p>The SNP leader said she did not envisage forming a formal coalition with Labour but confirmed even a “less formal arrangement” would be conditional on the party respecting the right of Scots to “choose their own future”.</p>

      <p>Ms Sturgeon doubted Mr Corbyn would maintain his stance of ruling out a vote in the early years of his government if this was the price of striking a deal.</p>
      <p>She said: “Do you think he’s going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants for a couple of years to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?”</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson faced a bruising time in front of the Question Time audience as she was repeatedly challenged over her voting record and austerity.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said she was “sorry” her party did not win more fights during its period in coalition government with the Tories.</p>
      <p>However, she defended its current policy of revoking Article 50, stating it had been “crystal clear about that from the very beginning”.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was the final leader to face the public but was met with groans and laughter when he said MPs were given “every opportunity” to pass his Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister refused to apologise for comments he made in articles as a journalist, saying he “genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody”.</p>
