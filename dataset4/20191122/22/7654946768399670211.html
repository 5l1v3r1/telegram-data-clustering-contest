      <h1>Iran ordered to pay $180M to released Washington Post reporter, family</h1>

      <p>Iran was ordered to pay $180 million for imprisoning an American journalist for 18 months amid talks over the the nuclear deal that President Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/08/trump-says-hes-pulling-us-out-of-iran-nuclear-deal/">withdrew from last year</a>, according to a report Friday.</p>
      <p>Washington, DC, federal Judge Richard Leon awarded the family of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian $150 million in punitive damages, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-judge-orders-iran-to-pay-180-million-in-damages-to-detained-post-journalist-jason-rezaian-and-his-family/2019/11/22/4911e5fe-0d63-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">the paper said</a>.</p>
      <p>Rezain, 43, was also awarded $23.8 million in compensatory damages for pain and suffering and economic losses, and his mother, Mary, and brother, Ali, were awarded $3.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively.</p>
      <p>“Holding a man hostage and torturing him to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States is outrageous, deserving of punishment, and surely in need of deterrence,” Leon wrote in his 30-page ruling.</p>
      <p>The damages were awarded in a default judgment against Iran, which never responded to the suit, and followed several days of hearings at which Rezaian and his relatives testified in January.</p>
      <p>Rezaian was a Tehran-based correspondent for the Post when he and his newlywed wife, fellow journalist Yeganeh Salehi, were <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/10/12/iran-convicts-washington-post-reporter-of-espionage/">arrested on July 22, 2014</a>.</p>
      <p>Salehi, who wasn’t part of the suit, was released two months later, but Rezaian was held until Jan. 16, 2016, when he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/01/18/us-prisoners-freed-in-iran-swap-reunite-with-families/">freed with three other Americans</a> in a prisoner swap on the day the multinational Iran nuclear deal took effect.</p>
      <p>Trump railed against the pact during his successful bid for the White House and last year announced that he was pulling out, saying, “The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should never, never have been made.”</p>
      <p>Iran has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/iran-to-inject-uranium-into-centrifuges-moving-further-from-2015-nuclear-accord/">repeatedly violated</a> terms of the Joint Comprehensive Pact of Action then, most recently by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/un-watchdog-iran-has-violated-2015-nuclear-deal-again/">stockpiling more “heavy water”</a> — which is used to cool nuclear reactors — than permitted.</p>
