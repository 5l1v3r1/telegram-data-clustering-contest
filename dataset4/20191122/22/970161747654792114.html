      <p>An inquest into the death of a Latvian man whose body was found in a burned out car with a shotgun wound to his head was unable to rule out murder at the behest of the Kremlin.</p>
      <p>The remains of Mikus Alps, 33, were found in Guernsey on January 10 last year, prompting one of the largest police investigations seen on the Channel Island.</p>
      <p>Reports in the former Soviet Bloc suggested he was killed over his involvement fighting with Ukrainian rebels against Russian forces.</p>
      <p>Police had stated they were keeping an ‘open mind’ about the investigation following claims Mr Alps was ‘tortured and murdered’.</p>
      <p>Andriy Gergert, commander of the eighth detached battalion of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army, posted on Facebook: ‘He was tortured and burnt in the car he used for the military needs of the battalion.</p>
      <p>‘The Sicilian Mafia is a kindergarten compared to the methods used by the Kremlin to achieve its imperialist goals. For them there is no difference whether they kill in eastern Ukraine or in centre of Europe. And they won’t stop.</p>

      <p>But an inquest this week heard Guernsey Police were unable to substantiate any of the claims.</p>
      <p>A coroner ruled a gunshot to the head caused Mr Alps’ death, but recorded an open verdict because it was not clear whether he turned the weapon on himself or was murdered with it.</p>
      <p>The hearing at Guernsey’s Royal Court was told that two days before his body was discovered, he called two friends, at 2.46am and just before 3.30am.</p>
      <p>Both said they thought they heard another person in the background, possibly with a foreign-sounding voice.</p>
      <p>Police and fire services attended the scene after the burnt-out car was discovered just before 7.30am on January 8.</p>
      <p>They decided to leave the car after satisfying themselves that everything in an around the vehicle that could catch fire had done so and there was no risk of it re-igniting.</p>
      <p>But forensics officers returned two days later after Mr Alps had been reported missing and they found a body in the charred shell that was left of the vehicle.</p>

      <p>Along with Mr Alps’ DNA, they recovered the remains of a shotgun registered to him which had been fired once.</p>
      <p>Toxicology tests detected traces of MDMA as well as amphetamine and Butylone, which the Procureur said was ‘a relatively new designer drug with intended effects being mild psychic stimulation and euphoria’.</p>

      <p>There were also traces of Diclofenac, prescribed for the relief of musculoskeletal and rheumatic disease pain.</p>
      <p>In his report, the Home Office pathologist commented that the scenario of a fire-damaged body in a burnt-out vehicle with evidence of shotgun discharge was typically suggestive of third-party involvement.</p>
      <p>Further expert analysis of the remains and the position of the shotgun yielded two ways the fatal wound could have been inflicted, only one of which could have been by Mr Alps himself.</p>
      <p>‘Given the condition of the body, the experts agree it is not possible to favour either scenario, said Procureur Megan Pullum.</p>
      <p>Despite a previous depressive episode and expressing potentially suicidal thoughts, the Procureur said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Alps intended to take his own life.</p>
      <p>Returning an open verdict, Judge Graeme McKerrell said he found the cause of death to be in accordance with the Home Office pathologist’s report – shotgun wound to the head, but without being able to exclude potential contribution from other injuries and or the effects of fire and or drugs.</p>
      <p>He extended the court’s sympathies to Mr Alps’ family and friends and gave approval for his remains to be repatriated to Latvia.</p>
