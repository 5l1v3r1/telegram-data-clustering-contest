      <h1>Bellator London: MVP vs Melillo Preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Lagdon</a></address>
      <p>It’s been a year where Bellator have tried to make a major push into the European market with regular live events and mainstream TV deals. The sixth and final episode of the 2019 effort takes place on Saturday night from Wembley Arena in London which plays host to the promotion for the second time this calendar. This weekend’s card isn’t as stacked as the last time Bellator visited the venue but still features some intriguing bouts that will be of interest to both international and domestic audiences.</p>

      <p>The show is headlined by a welterweight meeting between one of the biggest stars in the UK, Michael ‘Venom’ Page, and the Italian Giovanni Melillo. This bout came together at the last minute because MVP’s original opponent, Derek Anderson, had to pull out due to an injury so the number of options for a replacement would have been limited. Melillo will be hoping to step up and cause a monumental upset which will be a huge task against the London Shootfighters athlete, who can end any bout in the blink of an eye.</p>
      <p>Page (15-1) remains one of the most talked about fighters on the Bellator roster and generates headlines whenever he competes. After opening his promotional run with nine straight wins, including victories over Paul Daley and David Rickels, MVP received the first loss of his MMA career when he was knocked out by Douglas Lima in the World Welterweight Grand Prix semi-finals. He rebounded in September with a highlight-reel flying knee finish against Richard Kiely in a bout which he was heavily favoured to win. The unorthodox striker will be looking to put on another impressive display in his hometown as he attempts another run towards the welterweight belt.</p>
      <p>Melillo (13-4) can head into the upcoming main event with no pressure as very few expect him to put up any kind of a serious challenge to Page. The 34-year-old is a well-travelled veteran who has competed for the likes of Cage Warriors and ACB over his 17 fight career. He has finished his adversary in 10 of his 13 victories which shows that he is always looking to close the show before the final bell. However, he has been stopped in all four of his defeats by knockout so will need to have his guard up at all times when standing across from MVP. The Italian is coming into his Bellator debut after overcoming UFC veteran, Will Chope, by unanimous decision in May and could become a regular face on the European series next year if he impresses on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>In the evening’s co-main event, UK fans finally get to witness a bout which they have been asking for since the days BAMMA were around. Fabian Edwards (8-0) and Mike Shipman (13-2) were on a collision course when they were under that promotion’s banner but Shipman getting signed to Bellator in May of last year temporarily kept the two apart. However, when Edwards made the move over to the organisation as well, it was only a matter of time until the two could settle their business inside the cage. Although a little of the sparkle was lost after Shipman slipped up in his last contest, it is still a matchup that needed to happen.</p>
      <p>Edwards is undefeated in his MMA career and has been touted as one of the biggest prospects emerging from the region. It was big news when he signed to Bellator towards the end of last year due to the number of impressive finishes on his resume as well as the fact he is the brother of top UFC welterweight, Leon Edwards. ‘The Assassin’ is 3-0 in the company so far and intends to make a big statement against his fellow countryman to prove he is the best English middleweight in the promotion.</p>
      <p>The former BAMMA middleweight champion, Mike Shipman, will walk to the Bellator cage for the sixth time this weekend and is looking to bounce back straight away following his first defeat since his professional MMA debut. In his first four promotional outings, Shipman finished all of his opponents in the first round which demonstrates his dangerous skills wherever the fight takes place. However, he was defeated by Costello van Steenis in London during the summer but is looking to return to the same arena to right those wrongs. None of his fifteen fights have ever gone the distance and the man known as ‘Seabass’ wants to finish Edwards in impressive fashion to prove he was the superior of the pair all along.</p>
      <p>Bellator London’s main card opens with a lightweight showdown featuring the anticipated promotional debut of a former Cage Warriors champion. Soren ‘The True Viking’ Bak made headlines when he signed with the Viacom-owned organisation rather than the UFC and he intends to take over the 155lbs division. He is facing former BAMMA two-weight champion, Terry Brazier, in a contest that will show who was the dominant lightweight on the European circuit. Both men are at their best when in grappling exchanges so it will be fascinating to see who can implement their game on the other.</p>
      <p>There are a host of recognisable names on the evening’s preliminary card which is 15 fights deep. Bellator Kickboxing champion, Denise Kielholtz (3-2), faces Turkish kickboxer and boxer, Sabriye Sengul (0-0), in the latter’s MMA debut. Tim Wilde (12-4) returns after his loss to Brent Primus to take on Charlie Leary (16-10-1) in an interesting domestic showdown and middleweight banger, Charlie Ward (7-3) hopes to keep his knockout winning streak alive by taking out Pietro Penini (8-1-1, 1NC). Also, UFC veterans collide when Sam Sicilia (17-10) goes up against Robert Whiteford (15-4) who recently signed to Bellator following a brief retirement.</p>
      <p>Bellator London can be viewed live on Channel 5 at 10pm GMT for fans in the UK on Saturday night and will also be available to watch in the US on the Bellator Mobile App at 5 p.m. ET. The preliminary card will be shown on the Bellator Mobile App for audiences in both countries at 4:30pm GMT which is 11:30 a.m. ET. Bloody Elbow will be reporting on-site in London so be sure to stay tuned all weekend long for results and reaction.</p>
