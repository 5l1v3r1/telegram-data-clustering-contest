        <b>Chelsea have been monitoring CSKA Moscow striker Fedor Chalov in case they can do January transfer business.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is understood to be a fan of his fellow Russian and the Blues are said to be interested if their transfer ban is overturned next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11865941/chelsea-set-for-verdict-on-transfer-ban-appeal-in-december">Chelsea expect to find out in mid-December whether their appeal against UEFA's punishment is successful</a>, and, if it is, they are prepared to enter the transfer market in January.</p>

      <p>Crystal Palace also remain interested in Chalov after having <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11706/11775484/fedor-chalov-crystal-palace-bid-rejected-for-cska-moscow-striker">a number of bids rejected for the 21-year-old in the summer</a> and are prepared to pay as much as £25m for a new striker in January.</p>
      <p>Their final summer offer came on Deadline Day to the sum of £23m and it was knocked back - but a source has told <i>Sky Sports News</i> that CSKA are preparing for his exit during their winter break by searching for a replacement.</p>
      <p>Chalov - a Russia international with two caps - came through the youth ranks at CSKA and has scored 32 Russian top-flight goals for them, including five in 16 appearances this term.</p>
      <p>Palace are also understood to be keen to sign two new full-backs in January and want to sign players under the age of 23.</p>
