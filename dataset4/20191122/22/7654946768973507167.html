      <h1>Trump wavers on flavored-vape ban, will propose raising buying age to 21</h1>

      <p>Tempers were white hot at the White House on Friday as anti-vaping advocates locked horns with industry manufacturers in a fiery showdown that unfolded in front of President Trump and TV cameras.</p>
      <p>The heated Cabinet Room meeting came as Trump continues to weigh a proposed sweeping ban on all fruity and sweet e-cigarette products, which his administration <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/11/trump-administration-considers-ban-on-flavored-e-cigarettes/">first pitched in September</a>.</p>
      <p>The president seemed to waver on the proposal Friday, saying he feared it would lead to black-market sales of unsafe products.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t give it to them, it is going to come here illegally,” Trump said during the meeting. “They could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible.”</p>
      <p>Seated next to Trump, Sen. US Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who has been pushing the nationwide flavor ban, stood with the anti-vaping advocates.</p>
      <p>“Most adults are not using flavors,” Romney insisted as he argued that varieties such as “Unicorn Poop’’ are only being peddled to attract young vapers.</p>
      <p>Industry leaders and lobbyists shouted back: “Yes they do!”</p>
      <p>But Romney stood firm, saying, “It’s the flavors that are drawing the kids in.</p>
      <p>“Utah is a Mormon state, and half the kids in high school are vaping.”</p>
      <p>Trump’s administration has vowed to take action amid the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/cdc-claims-47-americans-are-dead-as-a-result-of-vaping/">nationwide vaping crisis</a> that has claimed at least 47 lives and injured nearly 2,290 others as of Wednesday, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>More than 27.5% of high school students use e-cigs, up from 20.7% in 2018, according to a government study.</p>
      <p>Throughout the hour-long roundtable, Trump listened intently to both sides of the issue, prompting experts with questions like, “Tell me about my lungs” and, “So what would you do?”</p>
      <p>When Romney noted that e-cig behemoth Juul had already voluntarily pulled flavors from shelves, the maker’s rivals said that’s just because the vaping giant is trying to make them all look bad to gain market share.</p>
      <p>At this point, Trump quipped, “Sounds like Rockefeller.’’</p>
      <p>American Vaping Association President Greg Conley tried to tug at Trump’s competitive spirit by accusing the vaping critics of being funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, “who is no friend to your presidency.”</p>
      <p>“That’s obnoxious,” one person replied.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg in September launched a $160 million project to end youth e-cig use.</p>
      <p>One e-cig proponent warned Trump that a ban on flavors could lead to a loss of at least 100,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The anti-vapers tried to appeal to Trump, too, at one point telling him his instincts were right and that their solution was his solution — the flavor ban.</p>
      <p>Harold Wimmer, the head of the American Lung Association, pushed for a ban on all flavors.</p>
      <p>“That’s a big statement,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The president reiterated plans to raise the federal age minimum for buying vaping products from 18 to 21.</p>
      <p>He said no final decision had been made on the flavor ban and his administration would announce its plan “very soon.”</p>
      <p>“We want to take care of our kids, got to take care of our kids,” Trump said.</p>
