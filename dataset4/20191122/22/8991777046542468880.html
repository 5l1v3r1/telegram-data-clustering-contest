      <p>No matter whether you were a fan of Pochettino until the end or not, Spurs fans must now accept the fact that Jose Mourinho is in charge in North London.<br/> <br/>While the tactics and style of the Special One differ greatly from Pochettino, Jose has always won trophies wherever he has been in the world. Perhaps it is time for a move from style towards substance.<br/> <br/>However, despite the fact that Mourinho has won trophies across multiple clubs, he has also always had a large piggybank at his disposal. Chelsea, Man United, and Real Madrid are all very wealthy clubs, capable of spending far more than Tottenham.<br/> <br/>This will surely be the first time in a long time that Mourinho will feel the constriction of tight purse strings at a club.<br/> <br/>While I know that this Spurs squad needs investment, and a lot of it, I would be annoyed to see Jose given a war chest in January.<br/> <br/>Any abundance of money and big signings granter to Mourinho in the new year would simply represent funds that should have been given to Pochettino in the summer.<br/> <br/>The Argentine was not given enough money to complete his rebuild. The players he wanted to sell were not sold. And two of the three stars he brought in were only bought on deadline day, with one already injured at the time.<br/> <br/>It is no wonder that the manager struggled to maintain standards this season, especially with a number of first-team stars wanting the leave the club.<br/> <br/>While I would welcome big January spending as a much-needed cost, it would also come with a hefty dollop of frustration at what could have been with Pochettino. He deserved more.</p>
