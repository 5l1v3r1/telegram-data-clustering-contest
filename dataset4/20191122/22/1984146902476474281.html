      <h1>Steve Bruce on why people have the wrong idea about Jonjo Shelvey at Newcastle United</h1>
      <h2>Steve Bruce has been discussing just who will be captain in place of Jamaal Lascelles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Musgrove</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce has jumped to the defence of Jonjo Shelvey labelling claims that the midfielder 'doesn't care' about Newcastle United as incorrect.</p>
      <p>The club's head coach believes that criticism of Shelvey has been unfair - and in particular the suggestion the 27-year-old has a poor attitude.</p>
      <p>"He's got this perception about him that is he doesn't care - that's wrong," Bruce said.</p>
      <p>"He's a good pro, he's a good lad, and he's popular.</p>
      <p>"He trains well and I've got no problem."</p>
      <p>Shelvey took the armband on as <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Jamaal Lascelles</a> left the pitch against AFC Bournemouth through injury, and seems to be in line to take on the responsibility again with Lascelles ruled out with a fractured leg.</p>
      <p>Bruce seemed to hint that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Shelvey</a> would be his pick - although claimed he hadn't come to a decision on who would lead United out against Villa on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Who is the most experienced? Bloody hell, I've got another decision to make," Bruce conceded.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, I've not even thought about it.</p>

      <p>"That [<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Shelvey</a>] seems to be the normal one - to put it on him, and I've got no problem with that."</p>
      <p>With Shelvey in line for his third consecutive start in the XI - it marks quite the turn around for the midfielder who at one point looked to be fourth or fifth choice.</p>
      <p>Shelvey has often been labelled as inconsistent or lacking effort, but Bruce feels now the former Liverpool man is fully fit, United fans will see the best of him.</p>
      <p>"I think Jonjo carried an injury for a while and tried to just play through it and play with it - I think it's hampered him for a while. </p>
      <p>"His physicality was terrific in the last two games.</p>
      <p>"This perception that he can't run is not right.</p>
      <p>"So I think he's fit and now he's got to hit them levels and if he hits them levels with me then he'll be fine because we all know the ability he's got, it's the other side which you know he has to do and he's done it before."</p>
