      <p>Drone technology has come a long way from the simple toys we started playing with just a few years ago. They're frequently used for video and photography perspectives that we couldn't get any other way, and when you combine several drones together in synchronization they become something almost magical.</p>
      <p>Such is the case with the 800 drone display over the city of Nanchang in China. Over the span of just a few minutes the drones created images of several different aircraft, sometimes more than one at a time.</p>
