      <h1>49ers Announce George Kittle’s Status For This Weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:44:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The San Francisco 49ers are about to face the toughest three-game stretch in NFL history. Fortunately for the top team in the NFC West, it should have All-Pro tight end George Kittle back this weekend.</p>
      <p>Kittle suffered a knee injury a few weeks ago against the Arizona Cardinals. It didn’t look good at first, but the former Iowa star managed to stay in the game.</p>
      <p>San Francisco held Kittle out for the past two games, falling short to Seattle and needing a fourth-quarter comeback to defeat Arizona.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the 49ers will host the Green Bay Packers with first place in the NFC at stake.</p>
      <p>Kyle Shanahan won’t have offensive tackle Joe Staley or defensive end Dee Ford. However, the offense should have most of its play-makers available.</p>
      <p>George Kittle, Emmanuel Sanders and Deebo Samuel are all questionable for this weekend. They were all listed as limited participants during Friday’s practice.</p>

      <p>Jimmy Garoppolo would benefit greatly from having all his top weapons at his disposal this Sunday. Last weekend, the only reliable wide receiver on the field was Samuel, who finished with eight receptions for 134 receiving yards.</p>
      <p>With Kittle most likely active this weekend, the 49ers should have more than enough firepower to keep up with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Levi’s Stadium.</p>
