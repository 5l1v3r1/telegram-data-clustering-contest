      <h1>Jose Mourinho hits Dele Alli with stinging comment about recent Tottenham performances</h1>
      <h2>Alli has been struggling this season and was omitted from the last England squad - but Mourinho believes he is the man who can turn his fortunes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has hit Dele Alli with a stinging reminder that he should be one of the top players in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> midfielder has played in only five league games this season and his slumping form saw him axed by Gareth Southgate from the England squad.</p>
      <p>And as he prepared for his first game as Spurs boss at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> today, Mourinho told Dele face to face what he expects from him.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: “I have already spoken with him and I asked him if he was Dele or Dele’s brother.</p>
      <p>“He told me he was Dele. ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Play like Dele’.</p>

      <p>“I think he is potentially a fantastic player. Now I have to create a tactical situation he is happy with, give him the right dynamics and prepare him physically well because he has had important injuries and he is not on the top of his form.</p>
      <p>“I cannot expect him to play on Saturday – if he plays – and go there and be man of the match.</p>
      <p>“But he needs to go through a process that will bring the real Dele back because the real Dele is the one who in the last few years has impressed us all.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mourinho is focused on the pitch and has reiterated his call for his players to show no fear as they target silverware and a winning mentality.</p>
      <p>“With the squad we have and the quality of the whole structure of the club, we can have the same ambitions as they have at clubs that are bigger than us,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want my players to fear anything. We go for everything against everybody.”</p>
