      <p>CHENNAI: At a time when <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mobile-numbers">mobile numbers</a> have emerged as the key mode of identification and authentication in both public and private spheres, telecom regulator Trai wants to help enterprises keep a clean and up-to-date list of mobile numbers of customers.</p>
      <p>Trai, in an order on Thursday, ordered telcos to start submitting lists of permanently disconnected mobile numbers from their network on a monthly basis, to be called the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mobile-Number-Revocation">Mobile Number Revocation</a> List.</p>
      <p>The move is aimed to address a potential security risk situation when a mobile user has had his/her number permanently disconnected but fails to update their service providers, leading to confidential and personal information reaching unauthorised persons.</p>
      <p>A senior Trai official told TOI that telcos will now have the responsibility to submit a list of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/disconnected-numbers">disconnected numbers</a> every month, which the regulator will merely host on its platform.</p>
      <p>“The list would contain only numbers and not the name or any other personal details. Entities can download the report from our site and every entity has to abide by its own regulatory bodies in how they use those numbers,” the official added.</p>
      <p>Telcos must start furnishing the Mobile Number Revocation list by December 7 for the mobile number numbers disconnected during November 2019, and submit monthly reports thereafter.</p>
      <p>Currently, a mobile number, when surrendered or permanently disconnected, after a certain time period gets re-allocated to a new customer. But there is no system in place for banks and other stakeholders to get information about such numbers and deregister them. Faisal Kawoosa, co-founder of telecom consulting firm techARC, said when consumers don’t update service providers, it creates major disruption in service, especially in case of annual renewals, which do not regularly interact with consumers.</p>
      <p>“The other use (of such a list) is that it could also give a hint to banks within a month in case a consumer has intentionally not updated the bank, may be in case of defaulting. In such cases, banks would come to know and probably find alternative ways of getting to the consumers.”</p>
      <p>Trai, in its order, notes that the move will help stakeholders in transparency and enable the interested parties to clean up their databases, thereby not sending one-time password (OTP), etc to someone other than their customer.</p>
