      <p>Geoffrey Graff, 41, was in a 20-foot long bunker built 8 feet below the ground on land owned by Milwaukee Area Technical College, <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cbs58.com_news_man-2Dliving-2Din-2Dbunker-2Dalong-2Dmilwaukee-2Driver-2Dmay-2Dhave-2Dbeen-2Dthere-2Dfor-2Dyears&amp;d=DwMFAw&amp;c=QvQrCjPtO9cKGOfGYlNgXQ&amp;r=RY_DFMEIeadqVC8alHXSINzyPG0rr4DPSMRzayW8RnU&amp;m=73Aup--f5bZIfGdChRUd4R9JZFQIa_oSyKZYHo9XxHY&amp;s=XmAeev8sOPvbAUSwz_CtkcHag8u0WJKIyVLy9ZmHxg0&amp;e=">WDJT reported</a>. </p>
      <p>"Obviously it required some ingenuity for an individual to do something of this nature in, literally in an urban area, an urban setting, and it go undetected for any period," <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/man-living-in-bunker-along-milwaukee-river-may-have-been-there-for-years">Milwaukee County Sheriff Eaernell Lucas told WDJT</a>. </p>
      <p>The entrance to the encampment was concealed and the college had not given anyone permission to live on the land, the Sheriff's Office said.</p>
      <p>"Our investigation has not determined the exact length the individual may have been inhabiting in this encampment, but it's conceivable it may have been a considerable period," Lucas said at a news conference. </p>
      <p>Graff had fired a gun three times in frustration after his dogs ran away, bringing attention by law enforcement to the area, investigators said. </p>
      <p>Graff had four guns, three knives, a bow and arrow, supplies, a grill, propane tanks, a generator, and numerous hand and power tools, Lucas said. </p>
      <p>Deputies are still investigating.</p>
      <p>Graff is in custody and could face weapons and trespassing charges, but none have yet to be filed against him.</p>
