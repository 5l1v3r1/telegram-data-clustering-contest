      <p>Immadi Mahadevaswamy, the prime accused in Sulvadi Maramma temple food poisoning case in Hanur taluk, has approached Supreme Court seeking bail.</p>
      <p>Currently, he is in jail after being arrested along with three others in connection with the case on December 19, 2018.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the district sessions court had turned down his bail application.</p>
      <p>On September 25, a single-judge high court bench had also rejected his subsequent bail appeal.</p>
      <p>Immadi Mahadevaswamy has filed the bail application through Dua Associates in the Supreme Court on Thursday. The application is expected to be taken up for hearing soon.</p>
