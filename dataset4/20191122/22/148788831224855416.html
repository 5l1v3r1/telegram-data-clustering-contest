      <p>Yes, 2019 is almost over. We have one more month to get through, and then it’ll be time for a whole new year! But first, how about some new movies? December brings a ton of original Christmas content to Netflix. But it also brings some non-Christmas movies, too. And we’ve rounded them up! Here are the best TV shows and movies coming to Netflix in December 2019.</p>

      <h3>Malcolm X</h3>
      <p>What’s <b>Spike Lee</b>‘s best film? <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, perhaps? Or maybe <i>The 25th Hour</i>? The fact of the matter is, a good case can be made for <i>many</i> of Lee’s films to be considered his best – he’s just that great a filmmaker. Certainly one of his most epic films is 1992’s <b><i>Malcolm X</i></b>, starring <b>Denzel Washington</b> as the African-American activist. Lee’s film spans through a large portion of Malcolm X’s life, covering his early criminal days, his conversion to Islam, and his prominent rise.</p>

      <h3>Marriage Story</h3>
      <p><b>Noah Baumbach</b>‘s <b><i>Marriage Story</i></b> is an emotionally devastating showcase for the acting talents of <b>Scarlett Johansson</b> and <b>Adam Driver</b>. The two play a married couple going through a brutal divorce that’s further complicated by distance – he lives in New York, she’s in L.A. While this movie is often quite painful to watch – the emotions get raw and real, folks – it’s also one of the year’s best films.</p>

      <h3>It Comes At Night</h3>
      <p>The reaction to <b><i>It Comes At Night</i></b> was mixed, to say the least. The movie is unquestionably horror, but some of the marketing made it look like a more traditional horror film, and that’s not really what this is. Instead, it’s a slow-burn journey into darkness – a post-apocalyptic family drama that turns into a nightmare. This was the second feature from <b>Trey Edward Schultz</b>, who seems to specialize in dark family dramas. He even has a new one out this year – the devastating <i>Waves</i>.</p>

      <h3>Sweetheart</h3>
      <p><b><i>Sweetheart</i> </b>had an underwhelming release, to the point where I’m pretty sure most people don’t even know it came out. That’s a shame, because this is a nifty little monster movie. <b>Kiersey Clemons</b> is a young woman shipwrecked on an island. That would be bad enough on its own, but she also has to deal with a hungry monster that comes out of the sea to feed. Much monster mayhem follows.</p>

      <h3>The Two Popes</h3>
      <p>I know what you’re saying: “I can’t possibly handle more than one Pope.” But get this: what if there were <i>two</i> Popes? Wild, right!? <b><i>The Two Popes</i></b> covers the transition of power from Pope Benedict XVI (<b>Anthony Hopkins</b>) to Pope Francis (<b>Jonathan Pryce</b>), two very different men with very different approaches to the Catholic church. That may sound like a stuffy drama, but by all accounts, <i>The Two Popes</i> is quite lively and light on its feet, and boasts two great lead performances.</p>
