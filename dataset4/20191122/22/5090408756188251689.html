      <p>Netflix has hundreds of movies available to stream, and it can get a little overwhelming figuring out what to watch. That’s why Insider rounds up a list of great films (and TV shows) to watch on Netflix each weekend.</p>
      <p>The holidays are coming up, which means that there’s plenty of festive movies available to stream, including the animated children’s film “Klaus,” about a postman and a reclusive toy maker, and “The Knight Before Christmas,” which stars Vanessa Hudgens.</p>
      <p>In addition to the holiday fare, “Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator,” a shocking new documentary about the founder of a popular yoga movement, is also available to stream.</p>
      <p>Here are seven great movies you can watch on Netflix this weekend.</p>

      <h3>“Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator” is a shocking documentary about the creator of a popular yoga movement.</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80221584">Netflix description</a>: “This documentary charts the rise and fall of hot yoga founder Bikram Choudhury as his global empire is born and disturbing revelations come to light.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bikram_yogi_guru_predator">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: 89%</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bikram_yogi_guru_predator">Audience score</a>: n/a</p>
      <p>Yoga enthusiasts and casual practitioners alike should check out “Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator,” which features bombshell allegations against the hot yoga founder that rival those of the #MeToo movement. While it can sometimes be hard to watch, this documentary takes a necessary look at the patterns of alleged abuse that existed in the yoga community.</p>

      <h3>“Earthquake Bird” is based on a novel by a British writer</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80244457">Netflix description</a>: “In 1980s Tokyo, an enigmatic expat is suspected of killing her friend, who’s gone missing in the wake of their love triangle with a local photographer.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/earthquake_bird">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: 57%</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/earthquake_bird">Audience score</a>: 56%</p>
      <p>Featuring masterful performances by Alicia Vikander and Riley Keough, “Earthquake Bird” features several mind-bending twists that will leave you guessing til the end. The mysterious plot and film noir-esque setting of 1980s Tokyo make it an engaging, if not exactly groundbreaking, movie that’s still worth watching.</p>

      <h3>Vanessa Hudgens stars in the feel-good holiday rom-com “The Knight Before Christmas.”</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81026188">Netflix description</a>: “Medieval magic sends a 14th-century knight to modern-day Ohio, where he falls for a high school science teacher who’s disillusioned by love.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_knight_before_christmas">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: n/a</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_knight_before_christmas">Audience score</a>: n/a</p>
      <p>One of the best parts about the holiday season is the plethora of cheesy, feel-good holiday films available to stream, and “The Knight Before Christmas” is a must-watch for fans of Netflix’s other original Christmas movies. The plot is, admittedly, pretty corny, but Vanessa Hudgens is wonderful as a lovelorn science teacher. By the end, you’ll definitely be basking in the holiday feels – and rooting for Hudgens’ character and Sir Cole to end up together.</p>

      <h3>“Drive” was critically acclaimed upon its release in 2011.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd6f76f79d7571c564ed963.png"/>
        <figcaption>Ryan Gosling stars in “Drive.”<cite>FilmDistrict</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70189289">Netflix description</a>: “A Hollywood stuntman and getaway driver is lured from his isolated life by a lovely neighbor – until her violent husband is released from prison.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: 92% (certified fresh)</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011">Audience score</a>: 79%</p>
      <p>“Drive” doesn’t have an intricate plot or hard-to-understand characters, but it’s still an engaging movie to watch nonetheless. Focusing on the efforts of the Driver (played by Ryan Gosling) to protect his neighbor and her son, the film is an unabashed action flick that’s gorgeous to watch, too. Plus, Gosling and Carey Mulligan, who plays the Driver’s neighbor, give showstopping performances.</p>

      <h3>“Klaus” is a heartwarming, family-friendly holiday film.</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>“Klaus” features a star-studded voice cast.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80183187">Netflix description</a>: “A selfish postman and a reclusive toy maker form an unlikely friendship, delivering joy to a cold, dark town that desperately needs it.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/klaus">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: 89%</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/klaus">Audience score</a>: 97%</p>
      <p>Celebrities like Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, JK Simmons, and Norm Macdonald all voice characters in “Klaus,” a children’s film about an entitled, spoiled postman stuck in a remote Arctic town. It certainly lacks the panache of, say, “Frozen,” but for a holiday kids’ movie, it’s pretty cute.</p>

      <h3>A legendary jazz musician is the focus of 1980s documentary “Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser. “</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/60003961">Netflix description</a>: “The spotlight shines on iconic jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk in this 1988 documentary featuring vintage performance chips and interviews.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thelonious_monk_straight_no_chaser">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: 83%</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thelonious_monk_straight_no_chaser">Audience score</a>: 89%</p>
      <p>Thelonious Monk was a mysterious figure during his life, but this 1980s documentary seeks to uncover some of the talented musician’s secrets. Even though Monk was responsible for numerous jazz standards, and played with a variety of musicians, there’s still a lot to learn about him, which is where this engaging documentary (that’s a must-watch for jazz nerds) comes in.</p>

      <h3>“Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” wasn’t well-reviewed upon its release, but has since become something of a cult classic.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=fear%20and%20&amp;amp;jbv=11819434&amp;amp;jbp=0&amp;amp;jbr=0">Netflix description</a>: “A sports writer and his Samoan lawyer embark on a hallucinogenic three-day romp from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in this counterculture cult favorite.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas">Rotten Tomatoes critic score</a>: 49%</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas">Audience score</a>: 89%</p>
      <p>Even though critics hated it, “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” is worth watching for Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro alone. They both give outrageous, over-the-top performances that are fun to watch, especially if you’re a fan of the Hunter S. Thompson novel that inspired the film.</p>
