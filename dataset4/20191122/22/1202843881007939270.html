      <h1>PayPal to acquire online coupon site Honey for $4 billion</h1>

      <p>PayPal Holdings Inc. will acquire Honey Science Corp. for about $4 billion, making the popular coupon site its largest-ever acquisition.</p>
      <p>About 17 million people use Honey apps or web browser extensions to find discounts at online shopping sites. The startup was profitable in 2018, PayPal said in a statement. Shares of the payments giant were little changed in extended trading.</p>
      <p>Honey is valued at almost twice what PayPal paid for its next-largest deal, iZettle, the Swedish provider of small-business services it purchased in 2018, and marks the first major acquisition this year. Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman has signaled that PayPal, with more than $10 billion in cash, is on the hunt for more deals after a string of takeovers last year that included Hyperwallet and Simility.</p>
      <p>"You can expect us to be acquisitive going forward,” Schulman said on a conference call with analysts this summer. PayPal looks at hundreds of potential deals every quarter and sees them as a way to expand globally and accelerate development of new products, he said. Schulman described acquisitions as "a part of who we are on an ongoing basis.”</p>
      <p>Honey, which was founded in 2012, will keep its base in Los Angeles, and the founders will continue to run the business. The company’s services include a browser extension that automatically applies coupons at e-commerce sites. In a statement, PayPal said that Honey’s capabilities will give its customers a better shopping experience, and help merchants drive sales, partly with more timely and personalized offers.</p>
      <p>Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG, said the acquisition would help PayPal make "significant advances” toward becoming more relevant to users. It could also give customers and merchants a reason to choose PayPal "in the face of increasing competition from tech companies, such as Facebook Pay.”</p>
