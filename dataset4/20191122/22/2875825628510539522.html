      <h2>Kate Garraway made an offer in the jungle that was enough to bring blushes to the cheeks of the male campmates in I'm A Celebrity after Andrew Maxwell began choking</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:51:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Kate Garraway has brought tears to the eyes of viewers at home after she made an astonishing offer in the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camp.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old Good Morning Britain presenter had just helped comedian Andrew Maxwell from choking on camel steak, when she propositioned him with an extraordinary offer.</p>
      <p>The pair were part of the group at the Jailhouse, who were celebrating soap star Jacqueline Jossa winning them a full meal alongside with former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner, Myles Stephenson.</p>
      <p>There was drama though, as Andrew was so pleased to be eating a meal after rice and beans and basic rations, that he seemed to shovel it into his mouth at a rate of knots.</p>

      <p>A piece of camel meat then got lodged in his throat, dropping him to his knees as the fellow campmates rushed to his assistance.</p>
      <p>After he was saved from a brush with death, former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi offered to chew Andrew's food first to save him from suffering like that again.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway then piped in, offering: "I can chew your meat anytime you need!"</p>

      <p>Realising her faux-pas, Kate quickly tried to retract that offer, saying that it had come out wrong but viewers at home were already in hysterics at the classic innuendo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> was flooded with those watching who wanted to share their delight at Kate's offer.</p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: "'I can eat your meat any time you need' God help us!!!! Hilarious, @kategarraway #imaceleb2019"</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "@kategarraway I will chew on your meat anytime made me actually made me cry with laughter #imaceleb2019"</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "'I can chew your meat anytime you need' Kate Garraway you wee minx"</p>
      <p>While Kate may be away from the main camp, she has certainly leaped up the rankings as to who will win I'm A Celebrity, as viewers have warmed to her personality.</p>
