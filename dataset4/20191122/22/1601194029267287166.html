      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> have announced that tonight's scheduled airing of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/205-live">205 Live</a> has been cancelled, and confirmed that the WWE Network will instead show a repeat of this week's episode of NXT following SmackDown instead.</p>
      <p>The official statement was released less than four hours before SmackDown takes place live from Chicago, and less than six hours before 205 Live would have been scheduled to air live on the WWE Network.</p>
      <p>No reason for the cancellation has been given thus far.</p>

      <p>The statement was then released in an identical format across the WWE Network and 205 Live Twitter accounts, too. The comment section, predominantly on the 205 Live Twitter account, has been met with disappointment and several fans calling for the show to permanently move to Full Sail - the home of NXT.</p>

      <p>WWE NXT Cruiserweight Champion Lio Rush tweeted out just minutes before the initial announcement, stating that "The Cruiserweight division deserves better" before quoting WWE Network's tweet about the cancellation and adding a thumbs down emoji.</p>
