      <h1>Bitcoin (BTC) $10K Coming With $100K on the Horizon, Says Cardano and Ethereum Creator Charles Hoskinson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:15:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano and co-creator of Ethereum, says he’s waiting for Bitcoin FUD to die down after the world’s leading cryptocurrency dropped over $1,000 in two days, plunging from $8,193 to a low of $6,955, according to data compiled by CoinMarketCap.</p>
      <p>Says Hoskinson via <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1197896099106828288">Twitter</a>,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Bitcoin’s price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that’s going to change the world.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Appearing in a live stream from Dubai, Hoskinson confirms that developments for Cardano, a public blockchain that uses Ada cryptocurrency to send and receive digital funds, as well as the project’s cryptocurrency wallet Daedalus, are on track.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We’re really happy about Daedalus. We’re really happy about the code quality. We’re happy about how quickly we’ve been able to move this month and how much we’ve learned from moving this fast this month.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We’re really in a good stride and so next year is going to see a lot releases. It’s going to be easy for us to get these releases out and we’ll just continue getting more feature rich. We’re also looking to some state-of-art technology that wasn’t necessarily in our roadmap.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>…</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Cardano is kind of a financial operating system for those who don’t have one.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Hoskinson says the platform will offer an end-to-end solution that can be in full compliance with local regulations.</p>
      <p>Building infrastructure to complete a major paradigm shift in the world of global payments, financial platforms and monetary systems takes time. Before mass adoption, computer scientists are tasked with years of research, coding and testing.</p>
      <p>With several research threads in the Cardano ecosystem already coming to an end, Hoskinson says he’s looking ahead toward implementation in 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Other things are on the list like Ethereum interoperability. It’s really not hard to do. That’s going to be a big discussion in the December summit that we do.”</i>
