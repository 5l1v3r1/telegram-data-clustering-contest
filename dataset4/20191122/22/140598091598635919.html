      <h1>Pricier tickets, no salary cap and bigger grounds: Chelsea manager Emma Hayes on how to ensure women's game keeps growing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-whyatt/" target="_blank">Katie Whyatt</a></address>
      <p>Emma Hayes speaks slowly, measuredly, but hums with ambition. At Chelsea’s Cobham training ground, in the office that she has expanded from one desk and chair to a bespoke women’s team training complex over the last eight years, the WSL’s longest-serving manager gestures to the surrounding ring of full-sized pitches while Millie Bright, her centre half, brings tea for the assembled press. This is Hayes’ kingdom: so used is she to the increasing media attention that she barely notices the TV cameras, filming the club for a fly-on-the-wall documentary, circling over her shoulder.</p>
      <p>At 43, Hayes is as ambitious as ever. Ticket prices? Raise them. “The product is too cheap, league wide. We charge £9 – far too cheap. It doesn’t have to be ridiculous money, but we’ve got to value it. It’s a quality product.”</p>
      <p>Kingsmeadow, the 4,850-capacity ground that Chelsea Women have shared with Wimbledon since 2017? Expand it. The salary cap? Remove it. “I struggle with putting these limitations on things. ‘Don’t play in big stadiums.’ ‘Don’t pay women too much.’ Why? We should be aiming for the f*****g top of the sky for everybody involved in the game. Don’t limit it.” </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/chelsea-penalty-astounding-save-hold-manchester-uniteds-rapid/">Referees? </a>Make them full-time. “They’re paid £120 a game. Stop having a go at them. We need to put money, as clubs, into our officials. If this is where we’re going, why are we half-a****g it? They are scrutinised so much I just hope we don’t drive them out of the game in this temporary period.</p>
      <p>“The game is at this level now that Conference referees aren’t good enough. It should be Championship level. One of the things [referees are told] is women don’t remonstrate with the refs if it looks like a penalty. Well, that’s all changed now. Why? Pressure. Managers are getting more vitriolic, players are getting more aggressive. I watched the fourth official at the weekend and I thought, why are you not managing the benches? You’d better get used to it because we’re going to try and intimidate you.” </p>

      <p>Hayes is buoyed by the club’s latest arrival. Last week, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/13/chelsea-women-sign-australia-captain-sam-kerr-two-and-a-half/">Chelsea signed Australia captain Sam Kerr </a>on a two-and-a-half year deal that will make her one of the best-paid players in the WSL when she joins the club on December 27th. The Ballon d’Or nominee is the WSL’s most significant signing since the arrival of Carli Lloyd on loan to Manchester City in 2017. </p>
      <p>“She’s not about easy options and she’s not about going anywhere she didn’t feel they absolutely needed her,” Hayes says. “We’re a good fit, her and I. We view our journey and her journey in the same way. When you play the top, top teams, I know that my team are unbelievable defensively. We can stay in games. But I want to go and dominate the big games. That attacking development comes with time. It takes the longest to achieve because it’s all about relationships and chemistry with players. </p>
      <p>“I always remember that from the Arsenal men’s Invincible teams. It didn’t matter what Vieira did - he knew where Ljungberg was going. For us to put Sam into an already established team, you’ve got to really feel that will make a difference. I look at her and I think, you’re born Chelsea. You were made for the shirt. It’s a big club, a global club, a diverse club." </p>
      <p>It took in the region of two years to get Kerr. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/may-much-football-tv-women-cannot-accused-congesting-airwaves/">The WSL was not a hard sell</a> - “We are the top league in the world, and this is utopia for footballers” - but the recruitment process “is getting longer, more complicated, because there are fewer free agents. You have to work so far in advance - 16-18 months. It will get harder, I’m sure.”</p>
      <p>Kerr legitimises Chelsea’s aspirations of catching up to reigning European Champions Lyon, to whom the Blues lost in last season’s Champions League semi-final. “It’s harder to qualify for the Champions League than it is to make the semi-finals of the Champions League,” Hayes says. “The team that wins the WSL this year - that’ll be their finest achievement.”</p>
      <p>She was not surprised that Chelsea have averaged crowds in excess of 4,000 for their last two home games - how can she be, when there have been plans, for two years, to begin expanding Kingsmeadow at the end of this season? “But I’m worried we’re undercooking it,” she admits. “I’m worried it’s not going to be big enough.”</p>

      <p>The initial proposal was to expand to 6,000. “I don’t think it will be big enough anymore.” Her ideal? “10,000. It’s exploding. Nobody can do anything about it. I dare you to stop it.” Chelsea consulted with Spurs ahead of the latter’s first WSL game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last Sunday - WSL clubs, Hayes says, must keep exchanging information. </p>
      <p>She is that rare mix of ambitious and contented. Being a mother to her son, Harry, has changed her priorities: she is more protective towards the growth of the game. "My objective is that I can look back and say I’ve been a massive part in that. Whenever my time is to slide out, I’ll be chilling.”</p>
      <p>Does she know when that might be? “I don’t think I will be coaching my whole life," she answers. "I haven’t had a lot of time out of coaching in a long time. I’ve had two years off in the last 22 years. You have to constantly drive, drive, drive. You have to improve, reinvent yourself, reinvigorate. It is exhausting. I don’t know how long I will be coaching for but I don’t expect I will go on from Chelsea. Chelsea is my absolute home. I have made clear I don’t have national team ambitions. Maybe at the end of the day, but not now.”</p>
