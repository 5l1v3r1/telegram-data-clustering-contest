      <h4>Samsung Galaxy Note 10</h4>

      <h4>This deal runs now through December 1.</h4>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is one of Samsung’s latest and greatest flagship smartphones, and it has a whole lot to offer. For example, you’ll get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, along with 8GB of RAM and an impressive 256GB of storage. Along with those high-end specs, you’ll also get a 6.3-inch screen with a small hole-punch notch, and an excellent camera.</p>
      <p>Safe to say, if you’re in the market for a high-end phone, this is the way to go, especially given the discount you can get on Black Friday. You’ll also get a free pair of Galaxy Buds, which are well-rated wireless earbuds.</p>
      <p>To get the Note 10 for just $309.99, you will need to trade in an eligible, recently released phone – older phones can also be traded in, but you’ll get less money back and end up with a smaller discount.</p>
      <p>If you do not trade in a phone at all, you will still get a $200 discount and free Galaxy Buds, though, which is still a good deal. We recommend clicking in to see what you can get.</p>

      <h4>This deal runs now through December 2.</h4>
      <p>If you have a Samsung smartphone or you’re buying one on Black Friday, it’s worth considering the Samsung Galaxy Watch too. The Galaxy Watch actually works with any phone (Android or iPhone) and offers an easy-to-use software experience, decent fitness tracking, and more. The watch is pretty well designed too, so you’ll be able to wear it in any situation and with any outfit. The $80 discount makes it even more appealing.</p>

      <h4>This deal runs now through December 29.</h4>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 is one of the best tablets you can buy. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, along with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. The device also has a 10.5-inch screen and comes with a keyboard accessory, so you can use the tablet like a laptop in a pinch. The $100 discount isn’t huge, but it puts the tablet in the same range as the iPad Air.</p>

      <h4>This deal is available now, but the end date is unknown.</h4>
      <p>Samsung makes some of the best TVs around, and the company’s QLED TVs can rival even LG’s OLED panels when it comes to image quality. The Samsung Q80R is no exception to that rule. Samsung’s QLED tech allows for bright, vivid colors, and when combined with local dimming, you’ll get deep black levels and a high level of contrast too.</p>
      <p>Safe to say, this is easily one of the better TVs you can get. The 55-inch model of the TV is now on sale for $1,299.99, which is $700 off its normal price.</p>

      <h4>This deal runs now through November 30.</h4>
      <p>Samsung makes some great laptops too, so if you’re a professional or student who needs something relatively powerful, then this deal is for you. The Samsung Notebook 7 Spin is not only relatively well designed, but it’s pretty powerful too, thanks to the Intel Core i5 mobile processor and 512GB of storage.</p>
      <p>Sure, it’s probably not the best choice for gamers, but the laptop is still more than powerful enough for word processing, web browsing, and so on. It’s even more impressive given the $300 discount.</p>
