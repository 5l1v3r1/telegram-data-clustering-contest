      <h1>VAR will remain shrouded in controversy but chief is certain they will get it right</h1>
      <h2>Mike Riley believes the system will imrpve while acknowledging there is still plenty of work to be done</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Referees' chief Mike Riley has insisted that VAR will get better and improve after an inconsistent start but also admitted surprise at the amount of controversy the system has generated in the early stages of its introduction to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There have been some high profile VAR incidents in the first 12 match rounds of the season, most recently and notably a goal ruled out for offside for Roberto Firmino for Liverpool against Aston Villa but there has been no shortage of controversies.</p>
      <p>Much of the stick for VAR has come in the form of fans criticising the lack of communication on decisions to those in the ground, which has since started to be rectified during Leicester's 9-0 defeat of Southampton.</p>
      <p>Ryan Bertrand's red card was missed initially, checked on VAR by Mike Dean and then confirmed. A replay was then shown to the fans in the stadium but that, yet, is not commonplace.</p>
      <p>The Premier League and Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) are somewhat constrained in what they can do to improve VAR by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the games law-makers, but there are hopes for better consistencies and minimum time impact in the near future.</p>
      <p>That is another gripe, the amount of time taken to make decision which so far this season has ranged from 30 seconds to almost three minutes in some cases.</p>

      <p>Riley told <b>football.london </b>at a media gathering earlier this week: "The current select group [of referees] have got about 5,000 games between them as referees and fourth officials. We understand what they want to achieve as a group and the singular idiosyncrasies they have.</p>
      <p>"The learning curve we are all going through now is what decisions to we expect VAR to make? What is a clear and obvious error in the Premier League?</p>
      <p>"The fascinating thing through 12 match rounds is the debate in football. I was in the hub and listening to the commentary team calling one incident as a penalty and at the same time on a certain website, the pundit was calling it nor clearly a penalty and good use of VAR.</p>
      <p>"So all of us have got to go through this to come out with a better consistency. We need to keep minimum interference but the maximum consistency.</p>
      <p>"We can get better consistency with decisions, we can improve timing it takes. If we achieve them over time, which we will, then we will improve on the 91 per cent [success rate currently]."</p>
      <p>Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow spoke last week about the clubs' "grave concerns" over VAR so far at a shareholders meeting with Premier League clubs and Riley.</p>
      <p>"The message has got through to the league and to the referees' association that fans are unhappy, and many stakeholders in the game think we have to do a whole lot better," said Purslow <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50423973">as quoted by the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>"I expect to see real improvements in the speed of decisions, consistency of which is what everybody craves, and I think above all else for those of us in the stadia we want much better communication about what's going on before, during and after."</p>

      <p>The speed of the Premier League has proved to be a big contention point with VAR, which is only there to intervene with clear and obvious errors though what exactly those errors are specifically is very much a grey area - still.</p>
      <p>That has not helped with the controversy surround the system since its introduction and Riley admitted that he had been surprised at the amount of scrutiny VAR has generated in just five months of use.</p>
      <p>"It's a personal view, but I think if you look where it has been launched in other competitions, we have had greater controversy but then again, we benefited from the two-year trial and taking the learning from there as well," Riley said.</p>
      <p>"Look at other sports, there were quite a lot of conversations about Rugby World Cup and how well it worked. But they have been doing it for nine years.</p>
      <p>"You look at any country that has implemented VAR, there is always going to be a learning curve.</p>

      <p>"The worst outcome is when the ref makes it right, VAR intervenes and gets it wrong. Part of the balance is that if we are trying to protect against that, we wont intervene when maybe we should."</p>
      <p>The clubs, managers, fans, actually want VAR to improve in football. It's exciting. You look at the development of the referees in this process as well, but knowing we still have a long way to go."</p>
