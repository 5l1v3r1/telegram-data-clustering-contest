        <li>Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s first passenger pickup truck, the Cybertruck, on Thursday night in a town near Los Angeles.</li>
        <li>The unveiling was jam-packed with flames, people in all-black costumes, and video comparisons of the Cybertruck with the speed of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/porsche">Porsche</a>911 and the towing capabilities of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ford">Ford</a> F-150.</li>
        <li>One of the most viral moments, however, was the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-reaction-to-tesla-cybertruck-window-cracking-video-2019-11">infamous failed glass demo</a>.</li>

      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s first passenger pickup truck, the Cybertruck, on Thursday night in a dramatic showing that included flames, a “cybergirl,” and a failed test.</p>
      <p>The jam-packed unveiling included the traditional presentation of the truck’s specifications but in a glamorized and semifailed manner. To prove the strength of its “ultra-hard” stainless steel body, Musk asked Tesla’s lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, to take a sledgehammer to the side of the truck.</p>
      <p>And to show off the strength of the “armoured glass,” a metal ball was dropped onto an isolated panel at an elevated height without a shatter or a break. However, when the metal ball was thrown at the window of the example Cybertruck, the glass broke.</p>
      <p>Despite this, the Cybertruck was unveiled to many crowd cheers and photos, and with specs that surpassed those of its competitors, such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-economy-needs-125000-new-jobs-created-per-month-and-thats-being-optimistic-2009-12">Bollinger Motors</a>‘ fully electric all-wheel-drive B2 Pickup Truck. Production is expected to begin in 2021.</p>

      <h3>The unveiling started out with a self-titled “cybergirl” who said: “The Cybertruck, the No. 1 mode of transport for a cybergirl. The greatest evolution in vehicular fashion and function.”</h3>

      <p>There are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/grimes-elon-musk-cybertruck-unveil-as-cybergirl-2019-11">speculations</a> that the “cybergirl” was Grimes, Musk’s alt-pop-singer girlfriend.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>“I now present to you my creator,” cybergirl said. Enter Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s walk onto the stage. A short and awkward presentation followed, with Musk explaining why the truck was a necessary and revolutionary product.</h3>

      <h3>At last, the full showing revealed a futuristic geometric pickup truck to a crowd of smartphones, eager fans, and, of course, more fire.</h3>

      <p>The flames were obviously much more dramatic and monitored than <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-supercharger-station-catches-fire-at-wawa-store-2019-11">the Tesla Supercharger station that caught fire</a> at a Wawa in New Jersey just a few days prior.</p>

      <h3>The first of a series of demonstrations began when Tesla’s head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, appeared with a sledgehammer, first hitting and denting what Musk called a “regular truck door” …</h3>

      <h3>… before using the power of the hammer on the Cybertruck, which suffered no visible dents after the beating. This is because the automaker says the truck’s body — made of “ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel” — is almost impenetrable.</h3>

      <h3>To further this point, the screen behind Musk and the Cybertruck started playing prerecorded clips of the body being shot at with a 9mm bullet. The bullet shattered like a “paintball,” Musk said.</h3>

      <h3>Then came the testing of the Tesla Armour Glass, which Musk called “transparent metal glass.” Three testers — in all-black, steampunk-esque outfits — came out to initiate the test, first dropping a metal ball onto the shatter-free glass from a lower height …</h3>

      <p>Glass optics aside, the testers were reminiscent of well-coordinated magician’s assistants, with their confident but dramatically fluid movements.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>However, the success of the armoured glass didn’t last long. Holzhausen came back onstage with a large metal ball to throw at the window, which then cracked, not once …</h3>

      <h3>“We threw wrenches; we threw everything,” Musk said. “We even literally threw the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some weird reason, it broke now. I don’t know why.”</h3>

      <p>“Fix it in post,” Musk jokingly said, like an Instagram influencer trying to optimise their photos.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>But the pride of the Cybertruck was soon saved afterward, when Musk, now standing in front of a glass-shattered truck, played a video of a Ford F-150 and the Cybertruck in a “tug-of-war” competition that ultimately ended with the Cybertruck towing the F-150.</h3>

      <p>The Cybertruck can tow more than 14,000 pounds and carry a payload of up to 3,500 pounds in its most expensive configuration.</p>

      <hr/>
      <h3>There was also a speed test that showed the truck drag racing a Porsche 911, the latter of which received a head start.</h3>

      <p>“You could basically do the <a href="https://www.bajarallymoto.com/">Baja Rally</a> in this thing,” Musk said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The price and specs were then announced. The truck begins at $US39,900 for the single-motor rear-wheel-drive version that has a range of 250 miles. The most expensive tri-motor all-wheel-drive version starts at $US69,900 and has a range of over 500 miles.</h3>

      <p>The tri-motor Cybertruck can hit 60 mph in about 2.9 seconds. Self-driving features are a $US7,000 add-on.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The event closed out with a surprise unveiling of the Cyberquad, an electric ATV. The ATV will be available as a Cybertruck option.</h3>

      <h3>The loading of the Cyberquad onto the rear cargo area also allowed Musk to show off the truck’s “adaptive air suspension” which raises and lowers the Cybertruck’s suspension by 4 inches for easier access to both the cargo area and the cabin of truck. There’s also a self-levelling feature.</h3>
