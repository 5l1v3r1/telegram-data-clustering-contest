      <h1>Jurgen Klopp tells Liverpool stars there can be no excuses in Premier League title hunt</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool boss is hoping his side can continue their impressive form - but knows that there cannot be room for excuses if they are to win the title</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has told <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> they have now reached a level where there can be no excuses.</p>
      <p>The Reds boss knows his side will face more difficult times in their quest for the title, despite enjoying an eight point lead at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>But he believes that no matter what the problems to befall them - through a crowded fixture list and inevitable injury problems - the team has reached such an elite status they must cope with any setback.</p>
      <p>Klopp pointed to the historic 4-0 triumph against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> as ultimate proof of their resilience, where they produced one of the greatest European comebacks of all time without Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>“If you are on that level we are it is not allowed to look for excuses, you still have to deal with it,” he explained.</p>

      <p>“There are always things that happen. Like the Barcelona game at home we all the knocks you could get on top of the Man City v <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> game and all that stuff.</p>
      <p>“No time and no need for excuses. Try whatever you can to be as a successful as you can.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s resilience has come into sharp focus after <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss Mauricio Pochettino was sacked this week.</p>
      <p>It is widely held that his Spurs team simply failed to deal with the crushing blow of losing the Champions’ League final and their form this season shattered as a result.</p>
      <p>That is in stark contrast to Klopp’s men. They suffered a similar fate in the final the year before but used the experience to grow even stronger, and return a season later to lift the trophy on a glorious Madrid night.</p>

      <p>Likewise, they suffered the heartache of missing out on the title by a single point in what is regarded as the greatest season ever, but have returned this time around to open up an impressive gap at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>For Klopp, there is no magic bullet, or inspirational speech, just the fact his team know how good they can become. “I said a lot (to keep them hungry), but I don’t know what exactly,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I react to what I see. It is not fair to compare it to Tottenham because our squad was for the first time in that moment where we could make the final step.</p>
      <p>“With Tottenham, age group wise... four years ago you are very young, then you are not very young anymore. I cannot judge it and do not want to compare it.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool visit <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> tomorrow in what the manager believes is another severe test of his side’s character, given the searing atmosphere at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Yet he says the sheer size and legend of the club means his players will always stay hungry: “It’s not too difficult because the expectation level is really high.</p>
      <p>“Whatever we did we have to do the next thing. I don’t think anyone thought last year after winning the Champions League we can have a five year break without winning something.</p>
      <p>“It is easy to stay hungry at this club. You sign for that when you sign the contract. It is the club. It is the history. It is the supporters, of course.”</p>
