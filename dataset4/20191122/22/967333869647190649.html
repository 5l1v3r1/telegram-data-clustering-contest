      <blockquote>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, cited by AP, said that a 13-year-old boy was arrested and a weapon was seized. The suspect reportedly threatened to shoot classmates and staff at the Animo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in Willowbrook on Friday.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Los Angeles deputies <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911061077233342-us-authorities-release-suspect-in-east-texas-halloween-shooting---report/">said that they had executed</a> a search warrant and raided at suspect's home, seizing an AR-15-style assault rifle, a list of intended victims, a drawing of the school, and 100 rounds of ammunition.</p>

      <p>​The identity of the suspect remains unknown. Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced a news conference later on Friday to release additional details, AP said.</p>
      <p>According to the media report, a 16-year-old last week <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908191076581729-three-mass-shootings-averted-over-the-weekend---us-authorities/">used a ghost gun</a> to fatally shoot two classmates and himself at the Saugus High School in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.</p>
      <p>Ghost guns are a growing issue for law enforcement agencies across the country as parts and blueprints for any number of weapons can be <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201910011076929552-us-man-fatally-shoots-suspected-burglar-before-returning-to-bed/">purchased online</a>, requiring very little skill to assemble.</p>
      <p>​Investigators are attempting to determine how the suspect acquired the gun. Though earlier reports suggested the weapon was unregistered, Sheriff Alex Villanueva now claims that the rifle has a serial number.</p>
