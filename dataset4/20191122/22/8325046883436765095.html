      <h3>One of the popular decor trends of the 2010s was blue, gray, and other cool colors in homes.</h3>

      <p>“The design world started to move away from warmer tones and move on to cooler colors as an overall palette,” Ashley Quinn, vice president of creative marketing at <a href="http://www.imgnyc.com/">Interior Marketing Group</a>, told Insider.</p>
      <p>“Say goodbye to the standard beige that was once referred to as ‘builder beige,’ and hello to the cool, calming tones of gray,” she added.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>White-on-white kitchens were a fixture of modern design in the 2010s.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>“The strongest trend of all that has stood the test of time is the white kitchen,” Quinn said of decor in the last decade.</p>
      <p>“It’s timeless, classic, and chic,” she added.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>And in those white kitchens, people gravitated towards brass or bronze finishes to add a subtle pop of color.</h3>

      <p>“There’s been a move away from nickel finishes and onto brass and bronze to help balance those cool walls and fabrics,” Quinn told Insider.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>There was a wallpaper renaissance in the 2010s, as well as an interest in accent walls.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Quinn found the wallpaper and accent wall most surprising of all the decor trends that were popular in the last 10 years, and she’s not alone in that opinion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/interior-design">Interior designer</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/hgtv">HGTV</a> star <a href="https://leanneford.com/">Leanne Ford</a> told Insider that she “can’t get into an accent wall.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Painted floors also had a moment during the decade.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Floor paint was like an accent wall for the ground, and it was viewed as an easy way to spice up a space.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty sure that painted floors will not be returning,” Quinn told Insider of the trend.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>“My favorite decor trend of the last 10 years is the reintroduction of the curved sofa,” Quinn told Insider.</h3>

        <figcaption>Curved sofas also came back into style in the last decade.<cite>Hoxton/Tom Merton/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“They’re incredibly versatile, sculptural, and add a touch of mid-century elegance to any room,” Quinn said.</p>
      <p>“They can help anchor a living room that’s a difficult shape or add some much-needed curves in a boxy bedroom.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The 2010s saw the rise of modern design in domestic spaces as well.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Quinn told Insider that the rise in modern design came from a surge of people knowing what was trending, thanks in part to HGTV shows.</p>
      <p>“Celebrities and non-celebrities alike over the past ten years have become much more knowledgeable about interior design, design brands, and modern design,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Cleaner lines, less ornate wood, and comfort and quality over furniture that no one can actually sit in comfortably are all things that became a top priority over the last decade,” according to Quinn.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>And mid-century modern furniture became popular in the last few years of the decade.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>“Mid-century furniture seems to have stayed around for the past few years, and I think it’s because of the way they’re being integrated into modern design,” Quinn said of the aesthetic.</p>
      <p>“They’re layered with clean, contemporary pieces and updated with beautiful luxe fabrics – making everything feel cohesive.”</p>
      <p>For instance, this couch has a retro shape, but the velvet green has a modern edge.</p>
