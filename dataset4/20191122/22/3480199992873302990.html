      <p>Jacqueline Jossa found herself unpopular with Ian Wright after deciding to rob I’m A Celebrity’s main campsite of a decent dinner.</p>
      <p>The soap star was picked by the public to do the day’s Bushtucker Trial but in a twist she was allowed to choose one camp member to join her.</p>
      <p>She chose Myles Stephenson and they set off for Ol’ Dingo Town where they were tasked by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly to complete the Snake Hotel challenge.</p>

      <p>Jossa and Stephenson had 10 minutes to hunt down stars hidden inside the snake-infested building and they emerged with the maximum of six.</p>
      <p>Despite completing the challenge, the pair were carted off to the Jungle Jail to join the outlawed stars including Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi.</p>
      <p>“It’s mixed emotions. Smashed the trial happiness, gutted to leave the others. It’s like being at the Soap Awards here, there’s so many of us,” said Jossa.</p>
      <p>In another twist they were faced with choosing whether to use their six stars to feed the Jungle Jail or the rest of the campsite.</p>

      <p>They settled the dilemma with a game of rock, paper, scissors and kept the food for themselves.</p>
      <p>Roman Kemp was tasked with revealing their decision to the other celebrities.</p>
      <p>Reading from a letter, he said: “Earlier Jacqueline chose Myles to join her in today’s trial, the Snake Hotel, where they won six stars.</p>
      <p>“They were then told they must join the outlaws in the jail house.</p>
      <p>“However, they were given the opportunity of whether to feed the main camp or take the food with them.</p>
      <p>“Jacqueline and Myles decided to take the food with them to the jungle jailhouse. As a result you have just got rice and beans tonight.”</p>

      <p>The news reduced the main camp to silence.</p>
      <p>Adele Roberts asked if Kemp was telling the truth and he replied by saying that he did not blame the pair as they had won the stars themselves.</p>
      <p>Ian Wright was less understanding, saying: “And now that’s just going to put me in the wrong vibe all day now.”</p>
      <p>Roberts told him not to dwell on it but later Wright admitted he was “gutted”.</p>
      <p>“Of course I am,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And I’m not going to be any different than that because I’m actually pleased I’m not in a situation where I’d have to make that choice. It would have actually made me feel terrible.”</p>
      <p>Fellow sportsman James Haskell told Wright: “I think that is absolutely the right decision but there are bigger fish to fry and it’s important that you have these emotions.</p>
      <p>“It’s important that you show it but it’s important that you put a line under that.”</p>
      <p>The pair then shared a hug.</p>
      <p>Only later did they discover that Jossa and Stephenson has used rock, paper, scissors to make their decision.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
