      <p>A 23-year-old man was found dead inside his basement office in Gurgaon’s DLF Phase III early on Friday. Police said the victim, Ravi Kumar, was found lying on an upturned chair with blood oozing out of his head.</p>
      <p>DCP (East Gurgaon) Chander Mohan said, “Prima facie, it appears he was strangled and hit with a sharp object on the back of his head.”</p>
      <p>Kumar ran a delivery system for a popular online shopping portal and rented the basement office a few months ago. He hailed from a village in Bihar and had been in Gurgaon for over one-and-a-half years, said police.</p>
      <p>Kumar’s relative Raj Bhushan Tiwari said he received a call from Kumar’s flatmate Friday, informing him about his death. “Some cash and his laptop, which he took to office daily, are missing,” he said.</p>
      <p>Police said Kumar left home in Palam Vihar at 6.30 am for office. Around 7.45 am, when a delivery boy showed up at the office, he found Kumar lying in a pool of blood. “CC TV footage has not been recovered yet. There was a CCTV camera outside the office but it was not working at the time,” said a police officer.</p>
      <p>Police said even though Kumar’s laptop and cash worth Rs 50,000 is missing, “personal vendetta cannot be ruled out. If the motive was just loot, the victim could have been just tied, and not killed.” An FIR in the matter has been registered.</p>
