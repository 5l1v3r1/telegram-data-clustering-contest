      <h2>The Gunners' boss is under scrutiny after a series of disappointing results and performances have left Arsenal with a difficult task to reignite their top four hopes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lee-dixon">Lee Dixon</a> believes <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> is at crunch point in his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> career and has urged the club's board not to back him in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have had a stuttering start to their season so far, with Emery now under pressure to produce improved results.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have failed to win in their last four matches, and have won just a third of their 12 fixtures in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>January would offer Emery the chance to try and add reinforcements to his ranks in a bid to challenge for a top four spot, but Dixon feels more signings would be a bad idea.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying Emery should be sacked," Dixon told the Express</p>

      <p>“I think every manager should get two years to get it right, but I know I am living in a dream world.</p>
      <p>“This is why pressure is on Emery. Can they solve the problems by buying in January? What are the board seeing? They have given him a warning.</p>
      <p>“I think they are reluctant to push the button because it is too early. Arsenal look to do things the right way.</p>
      <p>“But personally, if it was my money I would be reluctant to hand it over. To me they are a long way off. Buying players in January would not solve things.</p>

      <p>“This next run of games is crucial for him. If they don’t get points and a place in the top four he is in trouble. That’s it for him.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal's next four Premier League matches see them play the bottom two sides - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , then Norwich, before a trip to mid-table <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> followed by the visit of 16th-place <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>But Dixon is unconvinced Emery is getting the best out of his side, and something must change in order for him to keep his job.</p>

      <p>“It has not been good enough," Dixon added. "It is not his first season and so he cannot be cut any slack. Eighteen months in now everyone is looking at him.</p>
      <p>“But we keep seeing a repeat of the mistakes. They keep getting hit on the break, giving the ball away, giving away chances.</p>
      <p>“Things are not working. The question for Emery is - do you change the philosophy or do you change the players? He is at a crossroads.</p>
      <p>“The buck stops with the manager. If the players can’t do what he wants, it is a problem."</p>
      <p>One issue that still needs resolving is that of ex-captain Granit Xhaka, who was stripped of the armband after his outburst towards the club's fans.</p>
      <p>Emery's man-management has been called into question over the way he has dealt with the situation, not least of all by Dixon.</p>
      <p>“George Graham or Arsene Wenger would not have handled it this way," he said. "Having a vote on who should be captain was ridiculous. It undermined Xhaka.</p>
      <p>“He is a good player but not what Arsenal need. He tries but he has not got the football intelligence.</p>
      <p>“But he has been made a scapegoat. He behaved badly. But to get rid of him because of that was the wrong reason. Now Emery is under pressure and he needs all his troops."</p>
