      <h1>Miss Universe contestant representing Vietnam to wear iced coffee-inspired costume for competition</h1>

      <p>Hoang Thuy, the young woman representing Vietnam in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/miss-universe">2019 Miss Universe</a> pageant, will be wearing quite the elaborate costume on stage.</p>
      <p>She is set to depict "Ca Phe Phin Sua Da” (iced coffee with condensed milk), a very popular drink in the Southeast Asian country.</p>

      <p>The costume was created by designer Tran Nguyen Minh Duc. It features a bedazzled jumpsuit with tons of beading detail. It also has a large spoon prop, filter headpiece and cup skirt, but Thuy reportedly found that difficult to walk in.</p>

      <p>"Filter coffee with condensed milk is a favourite drink of many international friends. I believe I will give my best performance with this costume at the Miss Universe contest," Thuy said according to <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/style/vietnamese-beauty-to-don-filter-coffee-inspired-costume-at-miss-universe-pageant-4016230.html">Vn Express</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the woman representing Vietnam wore a food-inspired costume. H’Hen Nie donned a banh mi (bread) costume and she finished in the Top 5.</p>

      <p>Thuy will be competing against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miss-usa-2019-cheslie-kryst-history-kim-kardashian-law">Cheslie Kryst</a>, who is representing the United States after being crowned Miss USA 2019.</p>
      <p>She told Fox News after winning the title in May, “I prepared and I knew that I could be Miss USA,” she explained. “That’s what I wanted, and that was my goal. But actually winning is a whole other experience."</p>

      <p>"You know, when they called my name, my mind kind of went blank. All I could think was, ‘They’re about to put the crown on my head. Where’s my mom?’ And I was looking for her in the audience. She was there with a picture of my face on a stick, waving it around… But it was an amazing moment, and very surreal."</p>
      <p>The 68th Miss Universe show features 93 contestants from around the world. It will air Sunday, December 8 on Fox and Telemundo from Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. Steve Harvey is serving as host for the fifth consecutive year.</p>
      <p>“We have always been proud to give a global platform to diverse, ambitious and strong young women – our leaders of tomorrow," said Paula M. Shugart, president of The Miss Universe Organization.</p>
