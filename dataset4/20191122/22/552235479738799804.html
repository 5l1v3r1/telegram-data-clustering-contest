      <h1>Rangers boss Steven Gerrard delivers quirky quip on Alfredo Morelos</h1>
      <h2>The Rangers manager acknowledges the striker will be desperate to play every game, but stresses he must realise the bigger picture.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:29:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard admits there’s no point telling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> to calm his jets as he flies high for club and country.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> boss will make a last-minute decision on starting Morelos at Hamilton tomorrow as he prepares to return in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Morelos will land in Glasgow later today after he scored his first goal for Colombia on their two-match tour of the United States.</p>
      <p>He netted the only goal against Peru in Miami and then featured for 45 minutes against Ecuador in New York in a game they also won 1-0.</p>
      <p>Morelos has scored a staggering 23 goals already this season as Rangers prepare for a run of eight games to the end of December that could make or break their campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> said: “If Alfredo went straight to Hamilton from the airport he’d be desperate to play, that’s the kind of character he is.</p>
      <p>“It wouldn’t surprise me if Alfredo is kicking a ball around the aeroplane right now.</p>
      <p>“My job is to decide whether he should play as it’s about finding that balance.</p>

      <p>“I’ll pick a team capable of going to Hamilton and winning, but you are always trying to stay ahead of the game because we have so many important matches coming up.</p>
      <p>“I am looking at the bigger picture while all the players need to do is focus on Hamilton.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard confirmed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jordan-jones">Jordan Jones</a> has returned to full training and is in line for a first team comeback within 10 days, which could put him into contention for a place in the Betfred Cup final.</p>
      <p>The Northern Ireland international has been out for almost three months after injuring himself with a reckless lunge at Moritz Bauer in the last Old Firm game at Ibrox, which Celtic won 2-0.</p>
      <p>Gerrard added: “I can’t remember the last time we had everyone fit and available. I don’t believe we’ve ever had one.</p>
      <p>“Even in pre-season players can drop out with blisters because you are trying to push them.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to have a clean bill of health because we are heading into a crucial block of games.</p>
      <p>“However we all know, given the level of physicality and the tempo we try and play, that injuries will occur.</p>
      <p>“But it’s a fantastic time to be here because of the matches that are coming up.</p>
      <p>“The players have earned the right because of their performances in reaching the League Cup final and the Europa League.</p>
      <p>“We are still in with a chance of qualifying from the group and that’s the reason every game is so important.</p>
      <p>“We all signed up for this. That’s why we’re here.”</p>
