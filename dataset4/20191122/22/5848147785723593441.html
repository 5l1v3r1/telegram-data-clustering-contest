      <h1>Smoke haze hurts financial markets as well as the environment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:00:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/naomi-soderstrom-chao-kevin-li/" target="_blank">Naomi Soderstrom and Chao Kevin Li</a></address>
      <p>Sydney is currently blanketed by smoke haze from severe bushfires that have burned through New South Wales.</p>
      <p>Air pollution levels on Thursday reached <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-21/sydney-smoke-from-fires-unlikely-to-clear-today-authorities-warn/11723876">hazardous levels</a> for the second time in a week. The NSW Rural Fire Service has warned that haze could be around for days.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, several locations in Sydney had air quality index levels above 1000. Anything over 200 is considered hazardous. Health authorities in Sydney have asked children to stay indoors.</p>
      <p>You might be surprised to hear that while air pollution is <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution">bad for our health</a>, it can also be bad for the economy.</p>
      <p>In our forthcoming study in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3253449">Journal of Corporate Finance</a><br/>we show that air pollution impairs forecasts by financial analysts. This has implications for our financial system, which relies on accurate and timely information.</p>
      <p>Air pollution has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/air-pollution-rising-at-an-alarming-rate-in-worlds-cities">rising worldwide</a>. Currently, four in every five city dwellers are exposed to dangerous levels of outdoor pollution. We know that as well as harming physical health, it hurts <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.7.3652">worker productivity</a>.</p>
      <p>We investigated whether it also harms the decision-making ability of financial analysts. This is important because their reports play a crucial role in the functioning of capital markets.</p>
