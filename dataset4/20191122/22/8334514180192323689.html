      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork named four men to executive roles on Friday and outlined a six-point path to profitability, though the money-losing flexible office space operator said it will not be cash flow positive until 2023, according to a media report.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Claure, a SoftBank executive who was named executive chairman at WeWork one month ago, emphasized the company’s attributes as real estate concern, a departure from its past representation as a technology company, Business Insider said.</p>
      <p>Maurice Levy, chairman of ad agency Publicis Groupe SA, was named interim chief marketing and communications officer. A new chief product and experience officer, chief transformation officer and chief people officer were also named.</p>
      <p>Addressing an all-staff meeting a day after WeWork said it would lay off 2,400 employees, Claure said one of the company’s six “pillars” was member and employee experience, a “core differentiator” of the company. Members are WeWork customers.</p>
      <p>Claure also said WeWork would be “a more accountable organization.”</p>
      <p>WeWork plans to focus on its top 12 markets, including New York and London, and in the next 16 largest markets it will explore revenue-sharing agreements with landlords.</p>
      <p>In Asia and the Pacific, WeWork will continue expanding its joint ventures, and in emerging markets franchising will be the future focus.</p>
