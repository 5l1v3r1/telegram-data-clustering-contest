      <p>MANCHESTER, England -- Pep Guardiola insists there is no chance he will quit as Manchester City manager at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard will complete four years at the Etihad Stadium in the summer, matching his spell at Barcelona before choosing to resign. He has never been in charge of the same club for five seasons but Guardiola, who has a contract until 2021, says he is going nowhere.</p>
      <p>"If the people say do i want to stay? I want to stay," Guardiola told a news conference on Friday. "I don't have any reasons to move from here. I am incredibly satisfied to work with this club, with these players, and if the people think I am going to resign or be sacked for these results and nine points behind the people doesn't know me so I like to be in this challenge, I love to be in this position.</p>
      <p>"And if the club wants [me] next season I want to be here 100%.</p>
      <p>"I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and i want to work and live with them and I want to be here."</p>
      <p>Guardiola has guided City to consecutive Premier League titles and last season completed an unprecedented domestic treble after adding the FA Cup and League Cup. Defeat at Anfield before the international break left them nine points behind leaders Liverpool and despite the recent successes, Guardiola accepts he will need to maintain his high standards if he wants to keep his job.</p>
      <p>"If they decide the results are getting worse, they are going to take a decision, that's normal," said Guardiola. "It's not because I am friends with Txiki [Begiristain] that i am going to stay for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>"I am here because I win. If I don't win I'm in trouble i know that but I'm incredibly satisfied to work in this city and this club and I want to help this club to get better, I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer. If the club wants, I will stay."</p>
