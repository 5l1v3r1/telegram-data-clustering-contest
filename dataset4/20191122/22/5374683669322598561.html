      <h1>Turkey announces reward for info on Abbas rival</h1>
      <h2>Turkey offers $700,000 for information leading to capture of former senior Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:13:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Elad Benari, Canada</a></address>
      <p>Turkey announced Friday it would offer four million lira ($700,000) for information leading to the capture of former Palestinian Arab strongman Mohammed Dahlan, now exiled in the United Arab Emirates, <i>AFP</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Turkey accuses Dahlan of being a mercenary for the UAE and of being involved <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/215046">in the failed 2016 coup</a> attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as having told the <i>Hurriyet</i> newspaper that Dahlan would be placed on the country’s list of most wanted terrorists.</p>
      <p>Dahlan, a former security chief in Gaza under Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction, was ousted from the party in 2011 and fled to Dubai. His home in Ramallah was later <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/146166">raided by PA security forces</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/178493">Abbas has accused Dahlan</a> of, among other things, collaborating with Israel to assassinate a senior Hamas terrorist in 2002.</p>
      <p>Dahlan <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/221753">was sentenced in absentia</a> in 2016 to three years in prison for allegedly embezzling $16 million while serving as a cabinet minister.</p>
      <p>Turkish media, noted <i>AFP</i>, regularly accuse Dahlan of involvement in the 2016 coup, and recently of playing a role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul last year.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu last month accused the UAE of harboring a terrorist, telling the <i>Al Jazeera</i> network, “(Dahlan) fled to you because he is an agent of Israel.”</p>
      <p>Cavusoglu further accused the UAE of trying to replace Abbas with Dahlan.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/212897">A report</a> back in 2016 claimed that the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan were planning to have Dahlan replace Abbas as PA chairman.</p>
      <p>Two years earlier, reports said Israel <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/177156">was carrying out secret talks</a> with Dahlan and that then-Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/189492">met in Paris with Dahlan</a> – a report Liberman denied.</p>
