      <h1>Austin MacPhee rant in full as Hearts interim boss slams Allan Preston's 'lies'</h1>
      <h2>The comments were made before and after Hearts' win over St Mirren and MacPhee remains angry despite a public apology</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts interim boss Austin MacPhee has ripped into BBC Scotland pundit Allan Preston and accused him of lying about him and the club.</p>
      <p>Former Jambos defender Preston savaged MacPhee on the radio both before and after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a>’ 5-2 win over St Mirren at Tynecastle two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He criticised the caretaker boss for playing Craig Wighton in his first match after taking temporary charge, questioned the club’s academy system and slated the signing of French midfielder Malaury Martin, who flopped after arriving under Ian Cathro.</p>
      <p>The BBC have since issued a public apology to MacPhee – but it wasn’t enough to satisfy the fuming 40-year-old.</p>
      <p>MacPhee said: “There were a series of comments, particularly from Allan Preston, which were lies to back up his case. His case was that Hearts are in a mess and I can’t do a job here.</p>
      <p>“He then used four statements which were lies to justify that.</p>

      <p>“The first was that all we are doing are bringing in Manchester City academy players, when we don’t have a single Manchester City academy product in our squad.</p>
      <p>“The second was that I brought Craig Wighton back into the team (for the Betfred Cup semi-final) out of nowhere to stick two fingers up at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a>. Craig actually played Craig Wighton in the last two games Craig Wighton was fully fit for, away at Celtic Park and the Scottish Cup final.</p>
      <p>“He then got injured against Inverness and had a meniscus operation in London. So for the BBC’s ‘Hearts expert’ to use that is a) disrespectful to Craig Wighton, a young player who has been working really hard in rehab and b) totally factually incorrect.</p>
      <p>“He also claimed the academy was not working and that the last player we sold was Callum Paterson. Another lie. Marc Leonard was sold to Brighton and Jamie Walker was sold to Wigan.</p>
      <p>“Lastly, apparently I was the one who brought Malaury Martin to the club. I had never worked with Malaury Martin, didn’t know Malaury Martin. He has just picked an unsuccessful signing and said ‘he brought him in’.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t. However, there are five Northern Irish internationalists I have brought to the club. Arguably £25,000 for Michael Smith could be the best money the club has ever spent. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kyle-lafferty">Kyle Lafferty</a> was the top scorer and came close to breaking Robbo’s (John Robertson) 20-goal record. The best returns on investment have been Isma Goncalves, who I worked with at St Mirren, and Lafferty.</p>

      <p>“I know the difference between an error - we all make them - and a lie. It’s a malicious mis-statement. Four of them. I was very angry about that.</p>
      <p>“The BBC have issued a public apology to me, which they don’t issue very often, saying that they apologise for the tone and lack of balance in the show, directed at me.</p>
      <p>“I’m not actually bothered about that, it’s water off a duck’s back, genuinely. What I am bothered about is them saying that nobody is closer to the ground than Allan Preston and him either not doing his job or making things up. Live on the BBC.</p>
      <p>“You can see that I think that I need to defend my players, my team and inform the supporters properly. People take pot shots at this club far too easily.”</p>
      <p>As to whether there is a perception that MacPhee is something of an outsider and whether that counts against him, he was equally bullish in his repsonse.</p>
      <p>He added: “We probably all think we’re quite normal and we’re all a bit different. We’ve been in Scottish professional football for 12 13 years since I was at Cowdenbeath. So I’ve not been here five minutes, but the narrative seems to continue.</p>

      <p>“Maybe it’s more exciting for the media if somebody with a far bigger name works at Hearts than me. But my record stands up when I’ve been asked to be the interim manager. The assistants also have to take some responsibility for the team when it hasn’t achieved its potential.”</p>
      <p>As to whether his interim position comes permanent or he is offered the sporting director role Hearts are also recruiting for, MacPhee is due to meet with Ann Budge early next week and confirmed he had not yet been formally interviewed.</p>
      <p>Whether that come in the form of two separate interviews for the two jobs or a general discussion is unclear.</p>
      <p>“I speak to Ann pretty much on a daily basis,” said MacPhee. “She’s known me for the best part of three years and she will make an assessment on where my skills are best used within Hearts at some point.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think she’s in a rush to do this, in particular on the back of the performance against St Mirren and the attacking nature of the performance. And the Hearts supporters being behind the team who put that performance in.</p>
      <p>“We are due to speak at the start of next week and also midweek. More water will have gone under the bridge at that point and we will see. But whatever she and the board decide, I’m sure there will have been logic behind them deciding that.</p>
      <p>“It will not be an emotional decision, irrespective of some of the narrative floating about.”</p>
      <p>“I used the word malicious because the context I was talking about was someone opened the show with Austin MacPhee’s not for me, backs it up with four lies and then I get a public apology from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC.”</a></p>
