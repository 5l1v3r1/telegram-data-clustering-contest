      <p>But he hinted he could return if Steve Clarke’s men it to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: “First and foremost that is a decision for Scott Brown and whether he makes himself available for selection.</p>
      <p>“Then it’s over to Steve Clarke, and he will pick the best players available to make Scottish football a success again.</p>
      <p>"For Steve’s sake the more players available, the better.”</p>

      <p>Gerrard was impressed with Scotland’s midfield trio of Ryan Jack, John McGinn and Callum McGregor in the 3-1 win over Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>But he insists it was the introduction of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> star Jack that has made all the difference.</p>
      <p>Gerrard added: “It’s no surprise to me Scotland have won their last two games with Ryan Jack in the team. No surprise at all because I’ve seen it first hand here.</p>
      <p>“The midfield is the area of the team in which Scotland are strongest, but right now Jack is a match for any of them in terms of what he gives to a team, and what he gives to a manager.</p>
      <p>“A lot of Jacko’s stuff is not fantastic on the eye if you like. But if you are talking about an all round midfield performer he Jack is right in there with any of them.</p>
      <p>“In the first Scotland game he worked his way into it, and got stronger as it developed.</p>
      <p>“He got more used to the people playing around him, new manager, new players and a new way.</p>
      <p>“He did OK in the first game, and in the second game he was outstanding, and the three lads complemented each other well.</p>
      <p>“John McGinn is a fantastic player, Callum McGregor too, just to show everyone I’m not biased, he was fantastic. The three of them shone together and complemented each other well.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gerrard has made it clear <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4984066/rangers-fc-news-steven-gerrard-scotland-euro-2020/">Gers would be willing to move fixtures</a> if it helps Scotland realise their Euro 2020 dream.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’ll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we’ll do everything we can to help Scotland.”</p>
