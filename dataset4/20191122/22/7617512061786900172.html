      <h1>Victoria Royals storm back on Edmonton Oil Kings</h1>

      <p>The Dane was great. And also expressive.</p>
      <p>Victoria Royals captain Phillip Schultz looked to the fans and pointed to their hats after scoring his third goal, short-handed on a breakaway, in a 5-3 WHL victory over the Edmonton Oil Kings on Friday night. The headgear came flying over the glass from the 5,215 faithful at the Memorial Centre to celebrate the hat-trick from the two-time Danish world junior championship tournament player.</p>
      <p>The Royals could have folded after a disheartening shorthanded goal gave the Oil Kings a 3-2 lead early in the third period. But tallies by defenceman Jacob Herauf at 6:50 and Swiss rookie Keanu Derungs on a deflection at 8:25 gave Victoria a 4-3 lead before Schultz sealed the deal.</p>
      <p>The Oil Kings, who suffered through some awful seasons after winning the Memorial Cup in 2013-14, made it back to the playoffs last season and are now the No. 8-ranked team in the CHL national top-10 poll at 14-5-5. So this was a significant win for Victoria (11-8-1), despite being widely outplayed and outshot 39-20 by Edmonton.</p>
      <p>Royals goaltender Shane Farkas was the well-deserved second star sandwiched between first-star Schultz and third-star Tarun Fizer with three assists.</p>
      <p>But the win was sweetest for Victoria rearguard Will Warm. The three-season Oil King, acquired during the off-season, faced his old club. Warm admitted before the game it was going to be weird but that he was going to treat it as just another game.</p>
      <p>Forward Carson Miller, who has two goals in three games, returned to the Victoria lineup after missing 16 games to injury.</p>
      <p>The Royals now embark on a three-game road swing through Washington state Wednesday in Kent against the Seattle Thunderbirds, Friday in Kennewick against the Tri-City Americans and next Saturday in Spokane against the Chiefs.</p>
