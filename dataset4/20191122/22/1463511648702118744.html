      <h1>No cholera in Ita-Alamu, Kwara — Government, residents</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:11:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Residents of Ilorin, especially Ita Alamu, have refuted a social media post alleging the death of two children from cholera outbreak in the state.</p>
      <p>Magaji Ita-Alamu, Alhaji Saka Ayinde, said there was nothing like that in the area, contrary to a Facebook post by one Sholyment Olusegun Olusola.</p>
      <p>Head Mistress of Ita-Alamu LGEA Primary School, Hajia Halima Ibrahim, also denied the claim, insisting none of her pupils has suffered from cholera or diarrhoea — much less dying from such.</p>
      <p>The two, among others, spoke with a team of top health workers from the Kwara State Ministry of Health, led by the Director of the Public Health Unit, Dr. Oluwatosin Fakayode.</p>
      <p>“Apart from our visit this morning to the community and the school mentioned in the Facebook post, we have also visited public and private health facilities around Ita Alamu: Offa Garage Health Centre, Ise Oluwa Clinic, Imole Ayo Clinic. There is no reported case of cholera. No reported death also,” Fakayode said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>He added: “The surveillance focal person in Public health facility in Ero-omu close to the community was contacted and she debunked the rumour by saying no history of anybody admitted at the facility with history of vomiting or diarrhoea.”</p>
