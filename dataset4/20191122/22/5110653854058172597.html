      <h1>Harassment charges against DeMarcus Cousins dropped, but Lakers center could still face NBA punishment</h1>

      <p>Third-degree harassment charges against Lakers center DeMarcus Cousins have been dropped. Cousins' lawyer, Moshae Donald, told <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28141171/harassment-charges-demarcus-cousins-dropped">ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski</a>the misdemeanor case filed in Mobile, Ala., has been dismissed.</p>
      <p>An arrest warrant was <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/arrest-warrant-issued-for-lakers-demarcus-cousins-after-he-allegedly-threatened-ex-girlfriend/x5d4yaz1hl3c1etylg7whtde0">issued in August</a>after Cousins allegedly threatened to kill his ex-girlfriend, Christy West, who claimedCousins saidhe was going to shoot her during an argument about their son. <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/08/27/demarcus-cousins-accused-threatening-shoot-baby-mama-before-wedding/">TMZ shared a recording</a> of a phone conversation from West in which a man at one point says, "I'm gonna make sure I put a bullet in your fâ€”ing head." West said it was Cousins' voice in that recording.</p>
      <p>Although the legal case against the four-time All-Star has been dismissed, Cousins could face a fine or suspension under the NBA's domestic violence policy. <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1197990092549300224">As ESPN's Bobby Marks notes</a>, the league is allowed to move forward with its own investigation despite the fact that Cousins faces no criminal charges.</p>
      <p>After the recording became public, the NBA issued <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1166441665365794817">a brief statement</a>: "We are aware of the report regarding DeMarcus Cousins and are investigating the allegations." The Lakers shared <a href="https://twitter.com/sam_amick/status/1166421931765010432">a similar statement</a>, saying the team was "aware of the allegation" andtaking the claim "seriously."</p>
      <p>Cousins signed a one-year, $3.5 million with the Lakers this past offseason but has not played for Los Angeles after <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/lakers-demarcus-cousins-suffers-possible-knee-injury-report-says/1c230afzl567m1eyc4fg62zoh1">tearing his ACL</a> during a summer workout in Las Vegas.</p>
