      <p>Australia, playing their third match in successive nights, lost Nick Kyrgios to a collarbone injury before the quarter-final and faced a Canadian team who has a day off on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“The scheduling is a big problem,” twice Grand Slam champion Hewitt told reporters.</p>
      <p>“You know, for us to have had to play these three nights in a row, it’s not ideal.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I understand it’s the first time and you’re going to have hiccups and you’ve got to learn from it. But there’s been a lot of small problems, that’s for sure.”</p>
      <p>After a two-month break, Kyrgios had been in fine form in Madrid, bashing down 22 aces in a straight sets victory over Steve Darcis late on Wednesday to help Australia beat Belgium and reach the last eight.</p>
      <p>But the 24-year-old pulled up sore on Thursday and was replaced by Jordan Thompson, who lost in straight sets to Vasek Pospisil in the opening singles rubber.</p>
      <p>“I think (the injury) was similar to what he had at Laver Cup time,” Hewitt said of Kyrgios’s collarbone problem.</p>
      <p>“That’s just the way the cards fell. It’s been pretty tough I guess trotting back out the last three nights as well.</p>
      <p>“To Johnny’s credit, he went out there and left it all out on the court.”</p>
      <p>Hewitt has been a vocal critic of the revamp of the 119-year-old tournament that originally had home and away ties played throughout the year.</p>
      <p>Defeat, however, was no less difficult for the 38-year-old, who holds Australia’s record for Davis Cup ties and wins as a player.</p>
      <p>“I think in any kind of format that I’ve ever seen anyone play for their country, they go out there and leave it all out there,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The format changed but we still came here to give absolutely everything we could, and we did that.</p>
      <p>“So, yeah, we’re all hurting at the moment. But it just shows that it means something, which is good.”</p>
