      <h1>Singapore gives Hongkonger the boot for organizing discussion of city’s protest movement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:54:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Singapore has deported a Hong Kong YouTuber for organizing a small gathering to discuss the protests convulsing his home city in violation of public assembly laws, police said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The city-state’s elite are increasingly nervous about the unrest in rival financial hub Hong Kong, observers say, as they fear it could inspire demonstrations in the tightly controlled city-state, where protests are rare.</p>
      <p>Police launched a probe after Alex Yeung, a pro-Beijing restaurateur known for his anti-protest tirades on YouTube, organized the gathering last month in a bar with a handful of people, mostly Hongkongers.</p>
      <p>Organizing a public assembly without a police permit in Singapore is punishable by a fine of up to S$5,000 (about US$3,670). Repeat offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months or both.</p>
      <p>But after wrapping up their probe, police decided to merely give Yeung a warning and send him back to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“Singapore has always been clear that foreigners should not advocate their political causes in Singapore, through public assemblies, and other prohibited means,” a police statement said.</p>
      <p>In a video posted after police launched a probe, Yeung had accused supporters of the protests of setting him up at the gathering.</p>

      <p>In one video, apparently taken at Singapore’s Jewel Changi Airport on his way out of the country, Yeung noted that he had not been convicted of a crime, and thanked the Singaporean police, saying Singapore was a “civilized country with good law and order.”</p>
      <p>Yeung wasn’t the first Hongkonger to irk Singaporean authorities. Way back in 2016, prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong similarly made a splash by appearing via Skype at a talk in Singapore on the subject of civil disobedience. The organizer of the assembly, Singaporean activist Jolovan Wham, was ultimately <a href="https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/singapore-fines-activist-3-2k-event-organized-speak-hong-kongs-joshua-wong-via-skype/">slapped with a S$3,200 (about US$2,350) fine</a>.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been shaken by nearly six months of increasingly violent demonstrations, with protesters calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that the country would be “finished” if similar protests erupted there.</p>
      <p>“It will become impossible to govern Singapore, to make and carry out difficult decisions or to plan for the long-term good of the nation,” he said.</p>
