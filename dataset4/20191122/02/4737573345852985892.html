      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A former government official on Thursday (Nov. 21) suddenly appeared during the registration of New Party (新黨) legislator-at-large candidates, claiming he is "overseeing" the 2020 Taiwan elections for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
      <p>After a <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3817101">public outcry</a> over the inclusion of pro-unification commentator Chiu Yi (邱毅) on the Kuomintang's (KMT) legislator-at-large list, the New Party (新黨) announced on Thursday that Chiu would be added to its legislator-at-large list instead.</p>
      <p>Also added to the list were New Party spokesman Wang Ping-chung (王炳忠), Lin Ming-cheng (林明正), vice chairman of the party's cultural and publicity committee, and Yang Shih-kuang (楊世光), former New Party presidential candidate.</p>
      <p>New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming (郁慕明) announced the full list of legislator-at-large candidates during a press conference. Then, party officials headed to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to register the candidates.</p>
      <p>Sitting and waiting in the CEC hallway was Kuo Kuan-ying (郭冠英), a former executive secretary for the now-defunct Government Information Office and a pro-unification supporter. When reporters asked, "Why did you come with the New Party members?" Kuo smugly responded, "I have come here to supervise the elections in Taiwan Province," reported <a href="https://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=639849">SET News</a>.</p>
      <p>When reporters again asked him if he had come with the New Party, Kuo quickly responded, "No, no, I am [a member of] the Communist Party. I represent the Communist Party." At that moment, police officers stepped forward and said, "No interviews are allowed inside. Thank you," according to the report.</p>
      <p>The pro-unification Chiu Yi served as a legislator representing the KMT between 2001 and 2012, and was an outspoken political talk show guest after not being re-elected. He had run as a legislator-at-large candidate for the New Party in 2016, but failed to win the seat.</p>
      <p>In a recent Weibo post, Chiu wrote <a href="https://newtalk.tw/news/view/2019-11-13/326296">a congratulatory message</a> on China's 70th anniversary, saying he was "deeply touched after watching China's magnificent National Day military parade and hearing Xi's national speech." He concluded by saying that he is "proud of being a Chinese" and "China-Taiwan reunification is inevitable."</p>
      <p>On Jan. 11, 2019, voters will be able to cast ballots for a presidential ticket, a candidate for a local legislative seat, and a political party list of at-large legislative candidates decided by proportional representation.</p>
