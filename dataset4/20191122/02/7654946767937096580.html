      <p>A man drunk on vodka and beer allegedly groped a woman on a flight from Denver to Miami while his young son was sitting next to him, federal authorities said.</p>
      <p>Victor Maksimov was sitting in the middle seat on the Oct. 27 flight with the unidentified woman to his right and his young son in the window seat, authorities said.</p>
      <p>He offered the woman a mini bottle of vodka, which she declined, according to court documents.</p>
      <p>The woman then turned away from him to go to sleep and Maksimov touched her hamstring and buttock area, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The woman thought the touch was inadvertent â€” but Maksimov allegedly continued the groping, touching the inside of her upper thigh.</p>
      <p>After the second touch, the woman went to the rear of the plane and told a flight attendant about the groping.</p>
      <p>The airline staff gave her another seat at the back of the plane, where she broke down in tears, according to court documents.</p>
      <p>Authorities interviewed Maksimov on the plane and found several mini bottles of vodka in his bag.</p>
      <p>He was arrested by federal authorities on Oct. 28 and posted $25,000 bond, according to court records.</p>
