      <p>Chinese food delivery giant Meituan Dianping (03690.HK) beat market expectations with a 44 percent jump in third-quarter revenue and a second straight quarterly profit, as it increased its dominance in the business, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>Competition in China’s food delivery sector has become less cut-throat as companies roll back profit-damaging subsidies, which in turn has allowed Meituan to capitalize on its first-mover advantage over rivals in the country’s smaller cities.</p>
      <p>According to research firm Trustdata, Meituan has steadily increased its share of China’s food delivery market to 65.8 percent as of end-September, compared with 60.1 percent a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Revenue for Meituan, which is the country’s third-biggest internet company by market value and is backed by gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. (00700.HK), came in at 27.49 billion yuan (US$3.5 billion) for the July-September quarter, up from 19.1 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.</p>
      <p>That compares with a market consensus estimate of 25.92 billion yuan drawn from 11 analysts, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.</p>
      <p>It booked a profit of 1.33 billion yuan, its second consecutive quarter of profit since listing last September.</p>
      <p>“The two consecutive quarters of profitability give investors more confidence in the food delivery business model,” said David Dai, an analyst at Bernstein Research.</p>
      <p>Meituan’s food delivery division, its core business, reported revenue of 15.58 billion yuan in the quarter, a 39.4 percent increase from a year earlier.</p>
      <p>“Strong execution enabled Meituan to sustain [the] growth momentum, improve unit economics, and enhance the market position of core businesses,” said Wang Xing, the company’s chairman and chief executive, adding that consumers from lower-tier cities would become the future source of growth.</p>
      <p>Meituan said gross transaction volumes for the quarter rose 33.6 percent to 194.6 billion yuan, while the annual number of transacting users climbed 14 percent to 435.8 million.</p>
      <p>Valued at some US$72 billion, Meituan operates one of China’s most popular apps, also offering travel bookings, restaurant recommendations, movie tickets, bike-sharing and map services. It has also set up a grocery retail business, Meituan Maicai.</p>
