      <h1>Demand for bone conduction headsets gaining momentum</h1>

      <p>Global demand for bone conduction headsets is gaining momentum along with the thriving sales of true wireless stereo (TWS) headsets, according to sources at headset makers in China.</p>
      <p>A number of China-based makers have already tapped into the segment, with Morein Tech and Shenzhen Voxtech now among the leading group, said the sources.</p>
      <p>Having developed related products for six years, Morein has recently rolled out its seventh-generation bone conduction headsets targeting young users, according to company president Lu Haijun.</p>
      <p>Such headsets can be worn for a longer time, allowing users to listen to external sounds simultaneously, and keeping them alert to the surrounding environments whenever on the move or sporting, Lu said, adding Morein has been able to ramp up its sales significantly in 2019.</p>
      <p>Morein's total shipments of bone conduction headsets are expected to triple in 2019 from the 150,000 units shipped a year earlier, Lu revealed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, led by Apple's AirPods and Samsung's Galaxy Buds devices, global TWS headset shipments are expected to reach 100 million units in 2019, the sources estimated.</p>
      <p>Related supply chain makers shipped 17.5 million TWS headsets in the first quarter of 2019 and ramped up shipments to 27 million units in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research.</p>
