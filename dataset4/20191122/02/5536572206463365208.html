      <h1>Map Shows Data On Which States Support Colin Kaepernick The Most (PIC)</h1>

      <p>Colin Kaepernick hasn’t played in the league since the end of the 2016 season, yet he remains one of the most talked about figures surrounding the sport.</p>
      <p>Even more so now after his controversial workout in Atlanta over the weekend that had him suddenly changing the venue because of a waiver, and instead of having 25 NFL teams represented, it turned into just about seven or eight teams showing up.</p>
      <p>Just a simple mention of his name would show the many people who like and dislike him, and they are loud on both sides.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Betonline.ag, we now know which states support or do not support the former 49ers quarterback.</p>
      <p>The below map was created by using geotagged Twitter data.</p>

      <p>Illinois turned out to be the most supportive state, with Georgia and Orgeon following closely behind.</p>
      <p>The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback was basically blackballed out of the league after he took a stance to kneel in protest of police brutality during the pregame national anthem in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old is still trying to get back into the league.</p>
