      <p>The message had been delivered at 11:18 p.m. the previous night.</p>
      <p>“Hi pretty gurl, your mum told me to pick you up to maybe go get a few things,” the message read. “I am in the white van behind the grey car wright in front of your house.”</p>
      <p>The girl, who had been busy getting ready for school, showed the message to her mother, who asked not to be identified.</p>
      <p>She didn’t recognize the number either, and right away she knew there was something wrong.</p>
      <p>The mother dropped her daughter off at school, then told school officials and shortly afterward went to the police station to file a report.</p>
      <p>“I had the police call the number, and the police did,” the mother said. “They called the number, no answer.”</p>
      <p>FOX19 NOW called as well. We also got no answer.</p>
      <p>The mother says police did leave a message.</p>
      <p>“It really scares me,” the mother said. “It really does.”</p>
      <p>She says she’s going to keep a close eye on her daughter’s phone from now on. She’s considering changing the number.</p>
      <p>She also says she wants this to serve as a reminder for other parents.</p>
      <p>“We need to keep a close eye on our kids,” she said. “A very close eye."</p>
      <p>Cincinnati Police confirm they took a report. They say at present it’s not a criminal offense, as it could simply have been a wrong number.</p>
      <p>However, they also say charges could come if incriminating information arises.</p>
