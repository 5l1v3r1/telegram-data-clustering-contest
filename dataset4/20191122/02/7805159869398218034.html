      <h1>Redmi K30 live images confirm 120Hz refresh rate display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 730/G</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:03:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/aamirsiddiqui/" target="_blank">Aamir Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p>Xiaomi’s Redmi sub-brand attempted its first foray into the flagship market with the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-k20-pro-launch-india/">Redmi K20 Pro</a>, a device that was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/redmi-k20-pro-xiaomi-mi-9t-pro-review-flagship/">widely praised for being an affordable flagship</a> at a time when several other OEMs strayed further away from affordability. The K20 series was launched in May 2019 in China, but Redmi had revealed in October 2019 that it was already working on the successor to the series. The Redmi K30 was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-k30-5g-dual-punch-hole-front-cameras/">confirmed to be Redmi’s first 5G smartphone</a>, and the official teaser accompanying this announcement confirmed that it will come with dual punch-hole front cameras. Now, we are finally seeing the first live images of the Redmi K30, which go on to confirm that the next Redmi flagship will indeed have a 120Hz high refresh rate display.</p>
      <p>Just a few days ago, we had <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/redmi-k30-120hz-display-side-mounted-fingerprint-sony-imx686/">exclusively broken the news</a> that an upcoming Xiaomi smartphone — likely the Redmi K30 –will come with a 120Hz high refresh rate display as well as <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-teases-imx686-image-sensor-2020-smartphones/">Sony’s new IMX686 image sensor</a>, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. This news was based on code evidence found within <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/miui/">MIUI</a> 11 builds. Now, these new live images <a href="https://www.weibo.com/6561933432/IhmQuserq?from=page_1005056561933432_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1574403776466">originating from Weibo</a> corroborates some of our findings.</p>

      <p>First up, we have an image of the About Phone section within MIUI 11, which mentions the device name to be Redmi K30. The device pictured lines up with the official teaser image of the Redmi K30.</p>

      <p>The next image showcases the option to switch between 120Hz and 60Hz refresh rate options.</p>

      <p>The next image shows off the landing page of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finalwire.aida64">AIDA64</a>, which confirms the display’s 120Hz refresh rate capabilities, and goes on to mention the Adreno 618 GPU. The Adreno 618 is found on the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-665-snapdragon-730g/">Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 and Snapdragon 730G SoC</a>, which essentially confirms that at least one variant in the Redmi K30 series will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730/G, and that this variant will retain the 120Hz refresh rate display.</p>
      <p>Extrapolating on the existence of the Redmi K20 and a “Pro” variant, we can expect to see the Redmi K30 accompanied with a Redmi K30 Pro. Xiaomi confirmed the existence of a 5G variant of the K30 series as well, which makes it a possibility that there might be more variants in the lineup.</p>
