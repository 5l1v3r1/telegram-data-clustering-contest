      <p>The uncertainty over government formation in Maharashtra is set to end within the next 48 hours with the Congress and NCP reaching an understanding Thursday on backing a <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a>-led government in the state. The two parties, sources said, will join the government and the nitty-gritty of the power-sharing formula could be finalised and announced before Saturday. Sources in the Sena said Uddhav Thackeray has also called a meeting of party legislators on Friday morning.</p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-are-electoral-bonds-5673669/">Electoral bonds</a> with denomination of Rs 1 crore accounted for more than 91 per cent of the Rs 5,896 crore raised in the first eleven of the total twelve phases over which bonds were sold by select branches of the State Bank of India. The dominant use of high-value bonds clearly shows that almost the entire money came from the wealthiest section of the society.</p>

      <p>The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) faction led by Maulana Mahmood Madani has decided not to file a review petition on the verdict of the Supreme Court in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case. The JUH working committee that met on Thursday adopted a resolution describing the judgment as “the darkest spot in the history of free India” but said it wouldn’t file a review petition as there was “possibility of further damage”.</p>

      <p>The ironic juxtaposition of headline news from JNU and BHU reveals, more than anything else, the brutal distances that severe and separate us today as a nation. To say nothing of the ever-widening gulf between the nation and the university. At this moment, the two faces of student protest couldn’t be farther apart from each other. Differences indicate a robust democracy. Are we to conclude, then, that in its staggering diversity, student politics in India is in rude good health? writes Saikat Majumdar. </p>
