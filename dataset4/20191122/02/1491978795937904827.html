      <p>Developer Valve Corporation has unveiled the latest game in the long-dormant Half-Life series, a VR-exclusive title named Half-Life: Alyx, set for release in March 2020.</p>
      <p>A new game in the critically acclaimed sci-fi shooter series had been heavily rumoured following leaks from this year’s Game Awards and was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/19/new-half-life-sequel-vr-exclusive-htc-vive-headset">confirmed by the developer</a> via Twitter. A prequel set between the first and second games, Half-Life: Alyx stars supporting character Alyx Vance following an alien invasion of earth and is expected to act as a flagship VR title, showcasing virtual reality shooter gameplay at a high level of fidelity.</p>

      <p>Valve, which is better known these days for its juggernaut retail platform <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/steam">Steam</a>, a variety of eSports titles including DOTA 2 and Counter-strike, and various experimental games in other genres, first rose to prominence on the back of the Half-Life franchise. But the last game in the series, Half-Life 2: Episode 2, was released in 2007 with no sign of a follow-up until now.</p>

      <p>A statement describes Half-Life: Alyx as “featuring all the hallmarks of a classic Half-Life game: world exploration, puzzle-solving, visceral combat and an intricately woven story”, while Valve programmer Robin Walker <a href="https://au.ign.com/articles/2019/11/21/half-life-alyx-is-about-the-same-length-as-half-life-2">has told IGN</a> that the game “isn’t a spinoff or a side story – it’s a full-scale campaign … about the same length as Half-Life 2”.</p>
      <p>In a video interview with games writer/host Geoff Keighley, Valve developers also confirmed that there would be no non-VR version of Half-Life Alyx, emphasising its origins as an experimental VR project.</p>
      <p>They also confirmed that various high-profile developers at Valve including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/apr/19/portal-2-game-review">Portal 2</a> veterans Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton, as well as more recent acquisitions such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/01/firewatch-american-wilderness-campo-santo">Firewatch</a> developers Campo Santo, were working on the game.</p>
      <p>Half-Life 2 was positioned as a killer app promoting Valve’s Steam digital retail platform, and Half-Life: Alyx is similarly set to encourage wider-scale VR adoption as one of the few high-budget experiences available. But excitement for Half-Life’s revival is likely to be tempered by hardware requirements: as a VR-exclusive, the game will require a headset and the hardware to run it, as well as the free space to play in.</p>

      <p>Though the game will come free with Valve’s proprietary headset, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex">Valve Index</a>, and will work across PC-based competitors including the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, hardware pricing currently ranges from hundreds to thousands of dollars, excluding any PC upgrades required.</p>
      <p>In addition, some headsets – most prominently, the Valve Index – are not yet available worldwide.</p>
