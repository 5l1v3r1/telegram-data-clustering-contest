      <p>Citing sources familiar with the matter, <i>Bloomberg</i> reports demand for AirPods Pro has been "much higher" than expected, prompting suppliers to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019">push harder</a> against production capacity and technical limitations.<br/><br/>A number of existing suppliers are vying for a chance to build AirPods Pro, Apple's most feature-rich — and most expensive — <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/airpods">AirPods</a> model at $249. Certain manufacturers are only now ratcheting up capacity to meet Apple's demands, while others are playing catch-up in terms of production capabilities. <br/><br/>Currently, Taiwan-based Inventec Corp. and Chinese firms Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Goertek Inc. manufacture AirPods for the tech giant, the report said. <br/><br/>As noted by <i>Bloomberg</i>, metrics gathered by Counterpoint Research showed AirPods at the head of the "true wireless" headphone pack in August with <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-preferred-true-wireless-hearable-brand-future-purchase-us/">57% of customers</a> opting for the small, white earbuds. While that figure is down <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/29/apples-airpods-took-60-percent-of-fully-wireless-earbud-market-in-holiday-quarter">from 60% during the 2018 holiday season</a>, Apple as of August led second place Bose by a margin of 18%. Apple subsidiary Beats gobbled up another 26% of the segment with its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/powerbeats+pro">Powerbeats Pro</a> model. <br/><br/>AirPods <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/09/07/apple-debuts-159-airpods-wireless-earbuds-with-w1-wireless-chip-5-hours-of-battery-life">launched in 2016</a> as Apple's first foray into the truly wireless headphone market. An instant success, the company earlier this year followed up on the original with a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/20/new-airpods-arrive-with-hey-siri-support-and-new-wireless-charging-case">second-generation device</a> that boasts the efficient H1 processor with "Hey Siri" functionality. <br/><br/>AirPods Pro saw a comparatively muted announcement <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/apple-debuts-249-airpods-pro-with-active-noise-cancellation">in October</a>, though the product delivered long-requested active noise cancellation capabilities, a completely redesigned chassis, new audio technology and more. Reviews have been nearly unanimous <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/airpods-pro-review-you-dont-need-to-be-an-airpods-power-user-to-appreciate-them">in their praise</a> of Pro, lauding higher-quality audio, a better fit and increased functionality as compared to older variants.</p>
