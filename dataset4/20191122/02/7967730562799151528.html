      <p>The State Parole Authority said Obeid, 76, was granted parole after a private meeting on Friday. His first available release date is December 14.</p>
      <p>The former Labor minister will be subject to the standard parole conditions, including that he must be of good behaviour and seek the permission of the parole authority to leave the country.</p>
      <p>He is also subject to an additional requirement that he "not engage in any activity paid or unpaid involving the control of money or assets of other people or organisations".</p>
      <p>The parole authority said Obeid had "demonstrated satisfactory prison performance" and parole was recommended by Community Corrections in a pre-release report. It said Obeid also had "suitable post release plans in the community".</p>
      <p>In December 2016, Obeid was sentenced to five years in prison with a non-parole period of three years after he was convicted of misconduct in public office over his business dealings at Circular Quay. A NSW Supreme Court jury had found Obeid guilty of the crime in June that year.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, the High Court knocked back Obeid's application for special leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence, removing his last avenue for appeal.</p>
      <p>Obeid's defence team had mounted the novel legal argument that the NSW Parliament, rather than the courts, had exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases involving allegations of misconduct in public office.</p>
      <p>His barrister, Bret Walker, SC, argued in court that members of the NSW Parliament could not be "sanctioned by the criminal law" for failing to act in the public interest. He said such conduct was instead "sanctioned politically".</p>
      <p>But Peter Neil, SC, for the Crown, told the High Court there had been "no miscarriage of justice".</p>
      <p>"We're now told a member of Parliament is under no duty except to Parliament, [leaving aside crimes such as murder]," Mr Neil said. "That cannot be so."</p>
      <p>A three-judge bench of the High Court - Justices Virginia Bell, Patrick Keane and James Edelman - refused the application for special leave.</p>
      <p>In granting parole on Friday, the state parole authority said it took into account Obeid's age and the fact it was his "first period of adult incarceration". It also said the former MP had "limited access" to counselling and other programs in custody.</p>
