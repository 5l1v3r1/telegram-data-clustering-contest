      <h1>‘Bagel Boss Guy’ Chris Morgan is on the mend a week after stroke</h1>

      <p>“Bagel Boss Guy” Chris Morgan is on the mend one week after he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/bagel-boss-guy-chris-morgan-hospitalized-after-apparent-stroke-report/">suffered a debilitating stroke</a> outside a Long Island deli, his manager said.</p>
      <p>But Morgan, who remains hospitalized, is still unable to move the left side of his body, said his manager Bill Shannon.</p>
      <p>Shannon on Wednesday was briefed by Morgan’s father on the updated condition.</p>
      <p>“He told me he’s talking — the speech is more there,” said Shannon. “He has his eyes open, but he’s still dealing with numbness on the left side.”</p>
      <p>Morgan, 45, is also expected to begin a rehabilitation program sometime next week, Shannon said.</p>
      <p>Morgan, who gained viral fame in July for getting roughed up while <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/10/long-island-bagel-shop-customer-goes-on-bizarre-tirade-over-dating-apps/">ranting about women</a> inside a Long Island bagel shop, suffered the medical episode last Monday.</p>
      <p>Three weeks before the stroke, Morgan filmed an episode on “Dr. Oz,” <a href="https://twitter.com/DrOz/status/1195150061480660993">where he discussed</a> the impact his anger issues have on his health.</p>
      <p>The episode is set to air on Nov. 25.</p>
