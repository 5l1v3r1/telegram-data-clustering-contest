      <p>MADRID: American number three Reilly Opelka signed off from the Davis Cup Finals by firing a shot at the looming ATP Cup, describing the team event in Australia as "pathetic".</p>
      <p>U.S. hopes of reaching the quarter-finals of the revamped Davis Cup ended despite a 2-1 Group F victory over Italy in which the doubles rubber concluded at 4am.</p>

      <p>The new-look Davis Cup, replacing the old World Group format with an 18-nation seven-day showdown in Madrid, has split opinion and the 24-nation ATP Cup, taking place six weeks later, is seen as a rival competition.</p>
      <p>"Well, the ATP Cup is pathetic. I think it's shocking on behalf of the ATP for them to pass that and allow that," Opelka told reporters. "It's pretty embarrassing, actually.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty bad for the sport. It makes it more top-heavy than it already is."</p>
      <p>With only two singles players from any country permitted, Opelka says the ATP Cup should not carry ranking points.</p>
      <p>"For example, I'm (36) in the world. I'm not going to play because I'm the second or third-highest ranked American, and only the top two guys play," he said.</p>
      <p>The teams that participate in the Cup are determined by the singles ranking of their best player. For a country to qualify, it must have at least three players with ATP rankings, and two of them with singles ranking.</p>
      <p>Opelka pointed out that those competing in the ATP Cup will get an additional tournament to help their ranking.</p>
      <p>"It's unfair, there's not equal opportunity for everyone," he said. "For example, Moldova qualified. I mean, their No. 1 player is ranked pretty far behind me and their No. 2 player I don't think he's ranked.</p>
      <p>"So that's going to make for an 0-0 match that's going to be 30 minutes maybe. That's not good for the sport."</p>
