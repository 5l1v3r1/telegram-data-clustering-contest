      <p>NEW YORK — An Irish man has pleaded guilty to assault for punching another man who fell and died outside a New York City bar.</p>
      <p>Court records show Steven O’Brien pleaded guilty Thursday in the encounter that led to John McGee’s death last Thanksgiving. The 21-year-old McGee went by Danny and grew up in Ireland.</p>
      <p>WPIX-TV reports the 26-year-old O’Brien apologized to McGee’s parents in a Queens courtroom Thursday.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the two men argued and O’Brien punched McGee in the head. McGee fell and hit his head on the pavement.</p>
      <p>He was found lying on the ground and was pronounced dead at a hospital</p>
      <p>O’Brien is from Dublin. As a child, the American-born McGee moved to the Irish village of Drumlish.</p>
      <p>WPIX says O’Brien is expected to get a six-month sentence.</p>
