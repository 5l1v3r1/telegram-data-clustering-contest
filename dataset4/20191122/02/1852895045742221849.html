      <h1>French Montana Hospitalized After Suffering Terrifying ‘Cardiac Issues’ &amp; ‘Intense Nausea’ — Report  </h1>

      <h4>French Montana reportedly suffered an ‘elevated heart rate’ and more before he was rushed to the hospital on Nov. 21. The cops were originally called for a different reason!</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/french-montana/"><b>French Montana’s</b></a> “unexpected visit” from cops led them to decide the rapper needed medical attention ASAP on Nov. 21, sources told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/"><i>TMZ</i></a>. The L.A. County Sheriff’s deputies were actually called to the rapper’s Calabasas home for a “possible robbery,” according to law enforcement sources, but authorities instead found French, 35, in a concerning state. The deputies reportedly thought he was “acting abnormal” and “seemed out of it,” after French had been “suffering scary cardiac issues” — specifically, an “elevated heart rate” — “intense nausea” and “severe stomach pains,” other sources who are connected to the rapper told the outlet.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, French is now “awake” and “alert” after being taken to a San Fernando Vallery hospital, <i>TMZ </i>reported. He’s even looking at being released today (Nov. 21) after receiving treatment that involves IV fluids, the outlet added. <b>HollywoodLife</b> has reached out to French’s rep for comment.</p>
      <p>As for the source of this health scare, French has been continent-hopping (he recently visited Europe and Africa) and sources suspected that the rapper was “exposed to contaminated food,” per <i>TMZ</i>. Just five hours before the reported hospitalization, all seemed normal when French shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5JCVbYAxH6/">clip</a> of his interview from Billboard’s <i>Quizzed </i>series.</p>
      <p>French really has been grinding away. The <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/french-montana-pics-rapper-gunshots/">“Unforgettable” rapper</a> shared photos from his recent trip to Morocco on Nov. 18 and Nov. 12, celebrated his 38th birthday on Nov. 9, and even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4nW5t7J-NR/">announced</a> that his third studio album, <i>Montana</i>, was “DONE” on Nov. 8. He also has U.S. shows booked throughout December — perhaps French should take a minute to pause and take a breather? French has certainly accomplished a lot already, like the release of his “Writing On The Wall” <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/27/french-montana-cardi-b-writing-on-the-wall-song-video/">music video</a> in September, which featured none other than <b>Cardi B</b>!</p>
