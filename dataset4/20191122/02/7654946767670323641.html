      <h1>Louis Bacon steps away from hedge fund after Peter Nygard dispute</h1>

      <p>Louis Bacon, who’s almost as famous for <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/04/25/bahamas-billionaires-50m-brouhaha-is-back-on/">feuding with Canadian fashion tycoon Peter Nygard</a> as he is for running one of the world’s most successful hedge funds, is throwing in the towel as an investor of outside capital.</p>
      <p>Bacon’s $8.9 billion hedge fund, Moore Capital Management, will continue to manage money for its founder and his staffers, according to a Thursday letter to MCM investors.</p>
      <p>The letter highlighted MCM’s net annualized return of 17.6 percent over the firm’s 30 years, calling it a record “we remain proud of having delivered,” and a cumulative return of more than 21,000 percent.</p>
      <p>But it also acknowledged “disappointing results” in recent years as Bacon and Nygard, neighbors in the Bahamas, have endlessly battled each other in court and online over what started as a property dispute in 2013.</p>
      <p>That beef quickly spiraled into a legal free-for-all, with both deep-pocketed antagonists keeping good-sized law practices and p.r. agencies in clover.</p>
      <p>In one 2015 suit, Nygard accused Bacon of floating $50,000 worth of cocaine in the waters just off shore <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/07/21/wall-street-mogul-tried-to-frame-magnate-neighborhoor-with-coke/">only to have it wash up in Bacon’s own backyard</a>. Bacon followed up with a defamation suit accusing Nygard of masterminding a “malicious” smear campaign that linked him to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
      <p>The bickering has been so prolific that it produced court actions from New York to London to Los Angeles, where a former Nygard employee was accused of stealing video footage for Bacon’s benefit.</p>
      <p>The men have each denied the other’s claims.</p>
      <p>The litigation took its most recent turn on Nov. 15, when the Bahamas Supreme Court sentenced Nygard, 76, to 90 days in prison and fined him $150,000 over his alleged theft of confidential e-mails from a Bacon-sponsored environmental group.</p>
      <p>The group, Save the Bays, has been at odds with Nygard since 2013, when it accused the affordable-fashion designer of illegally expanding his Lyford Cay property — without obtaining permits — by dredging around it.</p>
      <p>Nygard, who was sentenced in absentia, also faces a penalty of $5,000 for each day he fails to comply with the court’s order, despite claiming he’s too ill to travel.</p>
      <p>Bacon, who founded MCM with a $25,000 inheritance from his mother, said “intense competition for trading talent coupled with client pressure on fees” also played a role in his decision to stop managing money from outsiders.</p>
      <p>“This privatization of MCM’s macro funds will allow me more personal time for a large family, philanthropic pursuits and to continue to develop a number of sports-oriented properties — all with the flexibility to ‘stay in the picture’ or not,” he said.</p>
