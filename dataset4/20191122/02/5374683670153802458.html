      <h2>New Right chairwoman responds to decision to indict Netanyahu.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:03:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:03</time> by <a rel="author">MK Ayelet Shaked</a></address>
      <p>A sad and difficult day for the State of Israel.</p>
      <p>First of all, every person has the presumption of innocence and so does Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I would like to address the baseless statements made today, which are based on a constitutional error, and it is important for me to clarify the truth: Over the next 21 days, the President has no discretion on whether to task anyone who has the support of 61 MKs with the formation of the government.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is no reason for the arguments that the court should intervene in a judgment that the legislature did not give at all. A Knesset member who collects 61 signatures receives the mandate.</p>
      <p>The decision on whether Netanyahu will form a government in the complex circumstances we are in today is in the hands of the Knesset members and their hands only.</p>
      <p>Even if, God forbid, we are dragged into another election, and Netanyahu runs, the President will have to consider afterwards which candidate has the greatest chances of forming a government.</p>
      <p>If it is Netanyahu then it will be Netanyahu. It is only at the discretion of the President and his discretion alone. The court cannot interfere in his discretion.</p>
