      <p>A new Kickstarter project called Diple claims it can magnify a smartphone picture by as much as 1,000 times.</p>
      <p>With this level of magnification, the microscope kit could, in theory, let you examine microorganisms, bacteria and blood cells.</p>

      <p>In terms of size, the Diple is comparable to a smartphone box. The kit uses prepared slides and features three levels of magnification (35x, 75x, and 150x) that can be enhanced by zooming in with the phone.</p>
      <p>SmartMicroOptics, the maker of the the Diple, says the device can reach 1,000 times magnification “before getting any pixelation.” However, this will vary depending on the phone.</p>
      <p>The Diple will retail for €53 (about $78 CAD), although lower prices can be snagged depending on the Kickstarter pledge tier.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the Diple has raised nearly $84,000 CAD of its $36,851 goal. Fundraising will continue until December 18th, with deliveries expected to take place starting next May.</p>
