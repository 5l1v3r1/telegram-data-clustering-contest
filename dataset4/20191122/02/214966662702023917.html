      <h1>One big reason to avoid eyelash extensions </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:12:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/meddler/" target="_blank">The Meddler</a></address>
      <p>We need to talk about eyelashes. Specifically: when did we all decide that the eyelashes we’re packing are not enough?</p>
      <p>Big, black false eyelashes used to be the sole domain of drag queens. Then they slowly became more prevalent with celebrities and socialites. Everyday ladies began sporting them at gala balls and events and flashy nights out.</p>
      <p>But now, false eyelashes are absolutely everywhere. They’re on the middle-aged woman serving you groceries at Woolies. They’re on the 20-something at the gym who is sweating it out with a face of no makeup. They’re even on the teenager working part-time in retail.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been considering getting your own eyelashes hyped up, here’s one big reason why you might want to think twice: eyelash lice.</p>
      <p>Yep, you read that correctly.</p>
      <p>Handing over your hard-earned cash for eyelash extensions could leave you with a nasty case of mites crawling around your eyes, according to new warnings.</p>
      <p>It happens when women don’t clean their eye area well enough because they’re afraid to touch them, lest their expensive new lashes fall out.</p>
      <p>“The lice burrow to the base of the lash follicles, and they feed off this material. Infection can set in if they overpopulate,” <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6191846/mites-eyelash-extensions/">warns Dr. Keshini Parbhu</a>, from the Orlando Eye Institute’s Dry Eye Help Center.</p>
      <p>If you visit a salon or engage a practitioner who doesn’t properly clean their tools, you’ll also be at higher risk of an infection, the doc says, advising that people who wear eyelash extensions should use medical-grade cleansers containing soothing Tea Tree oil.</p>
      <p>That brings me to my next point: how do all of these women afford it?!</p>
      <p>Lash extensions cost something like $70-80 per application, and they need to be updated every few weeks. Factor in some medical grade cleanser and this is a mighty expensive beauty habit.</p>
      <p>How did we possibly convince women that they need to be spending $1000+ per year to supplement their existing eyelashes which are, in all likelihood, good enough already?</p>
      <p>I blame the Kardashians (they’re an easy target!). Ever since they became famous with their over the top sense of “beauty”, they’ve redefined what everyday people accept as the average standard.</p>
      <p>It’s high time we gave this beauty trend the flick – and went back to accepting our poor little lashes as they are.</p>
