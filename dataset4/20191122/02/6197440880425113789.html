      <h1>$100 Google Store credit for pre-ordering Pixel 4 now available</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:18:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>This year’s pre-order promotion for ordering the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL before launch from the Google Store was a $100 credit. That amount has quietly been applied this evening and is available for use ahead of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>That straightforward promo effectively reduced the Pixel 4’s starting price to $699 and was available until October 26th. Google positioned it as a way to purchase accessories for your phone, especially given the lack of included USB-C headphones or adapter.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, Made by Google just <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/20/pixel-4-cases-ad/">posted a Pixel 4 Cases ad</a> yesterday. Delivery of the credit was promised within 6-8 weeks after the deal’s end, so the company is early by about two weeks.</p>
      <p>[<b>Update 11/22</b>: Google communicated the credit’s arrival on Friday morning to customers via email.] You can manually check by visiting the<a href="https://store.google.com/account?hl=en-US"> Google Store account page</a> or the “Payment” tab in Google Pay on Android. There are no steps for recipients to redeem. The promotional balance expires on 01/31/20, so it’s unlikely the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-pixel-buds-2/">new Pixel Buds</a> — arriving this spring — can be purchased with the credit.</p>

      <p>The Pixel 4 pre-order credit follows Google yesterday delivering the Cash Back from being a higher-tier Google One subscriber. Meanwhile, like last year, early adopters will <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/08/google-pixel-discounts-prices-early-black-friday/">likely be peeved</a> about the deeper $200<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/18/google-store-black-friday-2019/"> Black Friday and Cyber Monday discount</a> that starts November 24th.</p>
