      <h1>Facebook Dating Enhances Cross-App Integration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:57:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> Dating users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/facebook-dating-now-integrates-with-instagram-and-facebook-stories/">can now add</a> their Facebook or Instagram Stories to their dating profiles.</p>
      <p>Launched in September, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/internet-of-things/2019/facebook-launches-dating-service-in-us/">Facebook Dating</a> was created to give users “a more authentic look at who someone is.” In addition to photos, adding Stories can give potential love interests more information about a person by showing off their favorite activities, hobbies, interests, humor and more. Facebook Dating users will have control over what is shared, and if a Story is inappropriate, it can be blocked and reported.</p>
      <p>When browsing Facebook Dating, users will be able to view other people’s Stories, along with their profiles. If a match is made, those users can continue to view one another’s Stories, and even start a conversation in the app.</p>
      <p>The social media giant hasn’t disclosed how many people are currently using the service, which is available in the U.S. and 19 other countries. These include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam. It will reportedly launch in Europe by early 2020.</p>
      <p>Facebook explained that it created Facebook Dating to be safe and inclusive, working with experts to build in protections. The service also prohibits people from sending photos, links, payments or videos in messages.</p>
      <p>“People are suggested based on your preferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook,” said Nathan Sharp, product manager of Facebook Dating, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/facebook-dating/">when the app was released</a>. “Facebook Dating isn’t about swiping or having to wait for someone to like you to get a first chance at reaching out.”</p>
      <p>H continued, “If you are interested in someone, you can comment directly on their profile or tap on the Like button to let them know. If you aren’t interested, you can pass on them. Facebook Dating allows you to match with friends of friends and/or people not in your friend circle. Facebook Dating won’t match you with friends unless you choose to use Secret Crush, and you both add each other to your list. All of your Dating activity will stay in Facebook Dating. It won’t be shared to the rest of Facebook.”</p>
