      <p>In a Sunday tweet, porn star Teanna Trump (no relation to US President Donald Trump), alleged, tagging the official account of Oklahoma City Thunder, that one of the basketball team's players owes her, according a screenshot of a since-deleted tweet <a href="https://www.sportsgossip.com/porn-star-teanna-trump-says-an-oklahoma-city-thunder-player-owes-her-money/2/">obtained by SportsGossip.com</a></p>
      <blockquote>“Your player needs to PAY ME what he owes me. @okcthunder", Trump wrote.</blockquote>

      <p>Speaking on the "No Jumper" podcast in March, Trump claimed that she was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911131077297262-porn-star-khalifa-wedding-preagnancy/">introduced to pornographic employment</a> by a player with the Indiana Pacers, with whom she purported to have had sex when she was just 16.</p>
      <blockquote>“So the person that, like, got me, got me, got me into porn was a Pacers player. I was 16 years old — he hit me up on Instagram. We had pictures, we had <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911081077252899-porn-star-jessica-jaymes-suffered-from-depression-and-attempted-suicide-prior-to-her-death---report/">videos of me 16 and having sex</a> with this man", said Trump on the podcast.</blockquote>
      <p>The adult-film star later said that the Pacers player did not know at the time that she was underage, adding that she told him several years later. In many states there is no statute of limitations regarding sex with minors and, if taken to court and beaten, the player stands to lose his employment as well as <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911051077230370-porn-star-jessica-jaymes-death-cause/">spending time in prison</a>.</p>
