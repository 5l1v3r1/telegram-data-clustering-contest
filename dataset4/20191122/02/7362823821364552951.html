      <h1>Pennsylvania governor nixes Down syndrome abortion bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:26:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:26</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>'s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/democrats">Democratic</a> Gov. Tom Wolf vetoed a bill Thursday that would have banned <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion">abortions</a> in the state in cases where a fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome, calling it a restriction that interferes with a decision made between women and medical professionals.</p>
      <p>Wolf's action came a day after the state's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans">Republican</a>-led Legislature passed the measure amid a wave of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-passes-bill-that-would-make-almost-all-abortions-illegal-house-dems-target-trump-lawyers">abortion restriction bills</a> advancing in several conservative states.</p>
      <p>“Physicians and their patients must be able to make choices about medical procedures based on best practices and standards of care," Wolf, an abortion rights supporter, <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-vetoes-house-bill-321/">wrote in an online statement</a>.</p>

      <p>Pennsylvania allows abortions at up to the 24th week of pregnancy for any reason except to select a gender. Had it passed, the new measure would have prohibited abortions if a fetus is diagnosed with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/penny-nance-down-syndrome-hospital-lawsuit-abortion">Down syndrome</a>, except in cases of rape, incest or medical emergencies.</p>
      <p>Around 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome annually, according to the National Down Syndrome Society<b>.</b></p>
      <p>“There is no evidence that this bill is needed in Pennsylvania," Wolf said. "I have significant concerns that enforcement of this legislation would upend the doctor-patient relationship and impede on patient confidentiality."</p>

      <p>Supporters of the bill argued it would have protected a vulnerable population. Opponents said it would have violated women's right to make their own decisions about abortion.</p>
