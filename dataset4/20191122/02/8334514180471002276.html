      <p>Garrett was ejected in the closing seconds of the game in Cleveland after ripping Rudolph’s helmet off and striking him on the head with it.</p>
      <p>Hit with an indefinite suspension, Garrett will miss the rest of the regular season and any playoff games and must meet with the commissioner’s office before a decision on his reinstatement will be taken.</p>
      <p>The suspension was upheld on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The NFL has fined Rudolph for his role in the fight.</p>
      <p>ESPN reported that during Garrett's appeal hearing on Wednesday in New York he alleged that Rudolph used a slur but the NFL said on its website <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001079194/article/nfl-no-evidence-rudolph-used-racial-slur-at-garrett">here</a> that it had found no evidence to substantiate the allegation.</p>
      <p>The Steelers issued a statement saying their quarterback denied the allegation.</p>
      <p>“Mason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident Thursday night in Cleveland,” the Steelers said.</p>
      <p>Garrett said on Twitter: “I know what I heard.</p>
      <p>“I was assured that the hearing was space that afforded the opportunity to speak openly and honestly about the incident that led to my suspension,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>“This was not meant for public dissemination, nor was it a convenient attempt to justify my actions or restore my image in the eyes of those I disappointed. “Whether my opponent’s comment was born out of frustration or ignorance, I cannot say. But his actions do not excuse my lack of restraint in the moment, and I truly regret the impact this has had on the league, the Browns and our devoted fans.”</p>
