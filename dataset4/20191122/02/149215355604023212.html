      <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the federal agency that administers the country's naturalization and immigration system, and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-immigration-policy-posts-hardliners-including-officials-who-worked-for-a-hate-group-gain-key-positions/">two of its newest leaders</a> once worked at an organization that has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
      <p>John Zadrozny and Robert Law worked with Ken Cuccinelli while he was still acting director of the agency. Cuccinelli is now the second-highest ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, and Zadrozny, once his top aide, was promoted to acting USCIS chief of staff. Law, who was Cuccinelli's senior adviser, is now acting chief of policy. Zadrozny has pushed for slashing refugee admissions to zero, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/trump-officials-refugee-zero-1603503"><i>Politico</i> reported this summer,</a> while Law has publicly denounced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, saying those who support it favor "immigration anarchy."</p>
      <p>Both Zadrozny and Law worked at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), founded in 1979 by anti-immigration activist John Tanton, who once declared that a "Latin onslaught" was coming. The group says its mission is to "reduce overall immigration to a more normal level," but the Southern Poverty Law Center says it is actually a hate group, citing its ties to "white supremacist groups and eugenicists" and people who have made racist remarks.</p>
      <p>"These groups, which were basically outside of the mainstream, have been embraced by the Trump administration and their ideas are now policy, which is affecting millions and millions of people of color," the Southern Poverty Law Center's Heidi Beirich <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-immigration-policy-posts-hardliners-including-officials-who-worked-for-a-hate-group-gain-key-positions/">told CBS News.</a> FAIR's president, Dan Stein, said the organization has "never had any issue with immigration, per se. All we've ever said is that it should be lawful and that the numbers need to be properly regulated."</p>
