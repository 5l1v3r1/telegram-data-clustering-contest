      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Forecasters are urging residents to prepare for some blustery conditions Friday.</p>
      <p>A wind advisory is in effect for much of the state from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Areas in the advisory include most of Oahu along with portions of the Big Island, Maui, and Molokai.</p>
      <p>The strong winds are being blamed for knocking down power lines on Maui and damaging electrical equipment, causing islandwide outages.</p>
      <p>At last check, about 1,000 customers remained without power.</p>
      <p>Crews were also repairing a downed pole at Kamehameha Avenue and Hana Highway.</p>
      <p>Forecasters said the state will see east winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 50 mph. The National Weather Service said winds this strong could down trees and cause power outages.</p>
