      <h1>Mead of the right stuff: Port father-son pick primed to succeed</h1>

      <p>When Darren Mead talks about his playing days, he says less about what achieved and more about the calibre of player he lined up against.</p>
      <p>As a key defender during Port Adelaide’s early years in the AFL, Mead - who played 122 AFL games with the Power after a decorated stint with Port Magpies in the SANFL - was opposed to some of the greatest tall forwards of the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
      <p>“Wayne Carey, Matthew Richardson. He just touches on it a bit. I think he only played on Carey a few times. He just said he was a great opponent, but I think he actually did pretty well on him a few times,” Mead’s son, Jackson says.</p>

      <p>Jackson Mead is set to follow in his father’s footsteps. The emerging midfielder looks likely to be taken in the second round of next week’s draft, with Port Adelaide poised to match a father-son bid for the teenager after a trade with the Brisbane Lions during the week. But barely a year old when Darren played his last AFL game, Jackson hasn’t seen much of his old man play.</p>
      <p>“His footy was back in the day where it wasn’t really recorded a whole lot. I’ve seen clips here and there,” Jackson said.</p>
      <p>However, there was never any doubt around who Jackson would barrack for.</p>
      <p>“If I wasn’t a Port supporter I would have been kicked out of the house. I always had dad’s jumper, No. 33," he said.</p>
      <p>Jackson appreciates why there is interest in his story but he doesn’t feel as though he’s been substantially different to other juniors.</p>
      <p>“Around my footy mates I’m just sort of a normal person, but then to the media I am a father-son, and I do understand that,” Mead said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s been much sledging [on the field]. Maybe like, ‘Oh your dad’s better than you,’ or something, but nothing too major.</p>
      <p>“Dad’s been amazing, giving feedback or even helping us throughout the junior days, coaching us.”</p>

      <p>From a young age Jackson has wanted to replicate Darren and make it to the big time. Now he is on the cusp.</p>
      <p>“Obviously dad played footy and it’s always been a dream just to be at that same level or even higher. I sort of played soccer for a bit, but that was only for two years and was just a hobby thing.”</p>
      <p>He’s spent a bit of time with Port this year, working out in the club’s gym and spending time with the Power’s academy coach Paul Stewart. As a player he is determined to succeed.</p>
      <p>“I just pride myself on working hard and winning the contest, trying to do my best when the ball’s in my vicinity. Often when I’m in a contest I try and impact the play, whether that’s tackling or getting the ball out, and obviously trying to work towards that next contest. And then when I have the ball in hand, just trying to make the right decisions and make my disposal count.”</p>
