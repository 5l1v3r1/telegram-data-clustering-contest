      <p>The Texans entered Thursday’s game having scored 23 points in the first quarter this season. They remain at 23 points in the first quarter this season.</p>
      <p>But the Texans got a field goal early in the second quarter.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11602/kaimi-fairbairn">Ka'imi Fairbairn</a>, who has missed five field goals and five PATs this season, kicked a 35-yard field goal with 13:42 remaining until halftime. It has the Texans on top 3-0.</p>
      <p>Officials picked up a flag for an illegal formation on the Colts, but Fox rules analyst Mike Pereira said they should have enforced the penalty. He also questioned whether officials should have called <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13193/darius-leonard">Darius Leonard</a> for leverage by placing his hand on the back of a Texans’ lineman.</p>
      <p>The Colts have three penalties for 29 yards as is.</p>
      <p>Texans quarterback <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12151/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a> is 7-for-10 for 61 yards, with <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/8404/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a> making a toe-tapping, 6-yard catch on third down on the team’s field goal drive.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11341/jacoby-brissett">Jacoby Brissett</a> has completed 5 of 6 passes but for only 25 yards.</p>
      <p>The Colts’ possessions have started at their own 25, 1 and 9. The Texans have started at their own 15 and their own 46.</p>
