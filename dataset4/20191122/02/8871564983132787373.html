      <p>“I just don’t understand why people think it’s okay to ask me for pictures when my eyes are literally swollen from crying,” the beauty influencer <a href="https://twitter.com/bretmanrock/status/1197468040008474624">wrote on Twitter</a> last night. “How you gonna say ‘condolences, can we take a picture?'”</p>
      <p>Rock had already appealed for privacy in an earlier tweet, in which he wrote, “Can people just let me be sad for onces [sic]… I’m here in the Philippines for my dad who just passed, don’t come to my house and ask me for pictures.”</p>
      <p>He added that what his fanbase did was too close for comfort. “[S]o many people showed up to my dads [sic] funeral uninvited and started taking pics of my dad and my family.”</p>
      <p>“Like why?” he asked. “It’s common sense.”</p>

      <p>In the comments, his <a href="https://twitter.com/bretmanrock/status/1197468040008474624">other followers agreed</a>, adding that what other fans did was deeply disrespectful and reeked of selfishness. Fans also offered up their condolences.</p>
      <p>The Honolulu-based personality is one of the most successful global beauty influencers, with close to 14 million followers on Instagram and almost seven million subscribers on YouTube. The 21-year-old, who has collaborated with makeup brands Morphe and <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/lifestyle/fil-beauty-vlogger-creates-makeup-line-inspired-philippine-flag/">Colourpop</a>, started his career as a vlogger when he was in eighth grade, and was famous by the time he was 17.</p>
      <p>Born in Ilocos as Bretman Rock Sacayanan, he moved to Hawaii when he was 8 years old. Followers credit the YouTube star’s fame to his quirky sense of humor, sassy personality, and authenticity.</p>

      <p>On his Instagram account earlier this week, Rock’s honesty and sassiness were on full display when he posted a photo of himself crying, saying he was documenting his emotional state to show his followers that it’s OK to cry. The first photo was of him looking down at the camera, visibly puffy. The second shows a long line of snot coming from his nose.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to document these pics of me crying, to remind y’all that it’s okay to cry,” he said. “Bad bitches can cry, too.” OK. Let’s give him some space, people.</p>
