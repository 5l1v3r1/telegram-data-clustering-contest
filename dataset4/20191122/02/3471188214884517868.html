      <p>Do you fancy yourself a designer of fancy clock faces? Can you flutter with writing code… in Flutter? If so then perhaps the latest design challenge from the teams at Google and Lenovo might just interest you.</p>
      <p>To date, the Lenovo Smart Clock is the only device in the Assistant Smart Clock category (<a href="https://ausdroid.net/2019/08/25/lenovo-smart-clock-review/">p.s. we loved it</a>) and it seems Google wants a little more developer love thrown its way.</p>
      <p>The Flutter Clock challenge is offering a $10,000 (USD) prize for the most beautiful and innovative clock face for the Lenovo Smart Clock. Entries must be made using Flutter and will be judged on the following criteria; Visual beauty, Novelty of idea, Code quality, and Overall execution including accessibility.</p>
      <p>Entries are open to anyone except unfortunately for those registering from Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Sudan. Applications are open now and close on January 20, 2020 11:59 PM PST (GMT-8), with winners to be announced at MWC 2020.</p>
      <p>If any of you out there want to make an Ausdroid Clock face and enter it in the competition, you have our permission!</p>
