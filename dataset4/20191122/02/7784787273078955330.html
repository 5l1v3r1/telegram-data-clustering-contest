      <h1>Geelong superstar Patrick Dangerfield re-signs until 2024, turns attention to ending preliminary final hoodoo</h1>

      <h3>When Geelong led Richmond by 21 points at half-time in this year’s preliminary final, Patrick Dangerfield looked set to finally end his preliminary final hoodoo.</h3>
      <p>The Brownlow medallist had been the best player on the ground at the main break and the Cats should have gone down the race at the MCG even further in front.</p>
      <p>We all know what happened from there. Dangerfield failed to progress past the penultimate weekend for the third time since crossing from Geelong – and the fourth time in his career after Adelaide lost to Hawthorn by five points in 2012.</p>

      <p>But with the ink still drying on the three-year contract extension he signed on Thursday afternoon, which ties the seven-time All-Australian to Kardinia Park until the end of 2024, Dangerfield is ready to go again.</p>
      <p>Geelong may have lost game-breaking midfielder Tim Kelly during the trade period, but they gained four-time Trevor Barker Award winner Jack Steven from St Kilda and proven goal kicker Josh Jenkins from Adelaide to support star key forward Tom Hawkins.</p>
      <p>With his son George bouncing his knee, a laid-back Dangerfield told reporters at Kardinia Park on Friday the pain of falling short again in September is now a distant memory.</p>

      <p>“It doesn’t get any harder to come back. It is tough to look and go, ‘we were so close’, but you’ve just got to get over it,” Dangerfield said at a press conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been playing long enough now that reflection is important. But for us – and for me – it is about what can we control? That’s how we turn up individually, then collectively how we prepare ourselves.</p>
      <p>“It [pre-season] doesn’t get harder. We’re so privileged to play for this football club and being in the environment that we’re in.”</p>

      <p>Dangerfield reported back for pre-season on Monday – two weeks ahead of schedule – along with new recruits Steven and Jenkins, as well as gun midfielder Mitch Duncan, who signed a four-year extension earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>The three-time Carji Greeves medallist indicated he will finish his career playing inside 50, where he has proven to be a weapon under Chris Scott’s watch, booting 45.32 in 2017, including that unforgettable haul of 5.6 against Hawthorn at the MCG.</p>
      <p>“As I get a bit older and you’re not able to run as well and be as explosive in that midfield role, which is really quite demanding, potentially playing deeper as my career goes on,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is always fun to be around the ball, but it is fun kicking goals when the ball’s coming down there. I think that will be a natural progression at some stage in the not too distant future.”</p>
