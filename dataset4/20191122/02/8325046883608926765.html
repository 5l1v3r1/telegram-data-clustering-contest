        <li>When President Donald Trump’s handwritten note began making rounds on the internet, former White House photographer Pete Souza shared a side-by-side comparison of Trump’s memo and former President Barack Obama’s speaking notes.</li>
        <li>A consistent Trump critic, Souza is known for throwing shade at Trump by using old photos he took during Obama’s presidency.</li>
        <li>Throughout his term, the president has often denounced Obama and his political decisions, so much so that European diplomats reportedly believed Trump was “obsessed with Obama” in 2017.</li>

      <p>After a photojournalist snapped a shot of President Donald Trump’s handwritten “no quid pro quo” memo, the internet was quick to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/president-trumps-written-memo-has-become-a-meme-2019-11">react with memes and jokes</a>, including the former White House photographer from the Obama administration.</p>
      <p>A consistent critic of Trump, former White House photographer Pete Souza is known for bashing Trump using old photos he took during the terms of former President Barack Obama. When Trump’s handwritten note began making rounds on the internet, Souza shared a side-by-side comparison of Trump’s memo and Obama’s speaking notes.</p>

      <p>Souza has dedicated several <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-obama-white-house-photographer-pete-souza-trolling-trump-on-instagram-2017-3">Instagram posts</a> to trolling the president, using past photos of Obama in office to throw shade at Trump.</p>
      <p>Throughout his term, the president has often denounced Obama and his political decisions, so much so that European diplomats reportedly believed Trump was “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/european-diplomats-trump-laughing-stock-obsessed-with-obama-2017-8">obsessed with Obama</a>” in 2017. And the numbers show Trump’s fixation on the former president – according to an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/trump-mentioning-barack-obama/index.html">analysis</a> by CNN’s Daniel Dale, through October, “Trump had mentioned Obama by name 537 times during 2019 as a whole.”</p>
