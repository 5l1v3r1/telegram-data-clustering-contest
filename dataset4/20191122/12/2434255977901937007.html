We adore this sleeveless oversized midi dress from Zara.  You can get it <a href="https://www.zara.com/ie/en/colour-block-sequin-dress-p06206104.html?v1=28017370&amp;v2=1121004">here</a>.</p>

      <p>The rise of midi was a major trend this year and shows no sign of slowing down. Pleats were another big story over the past twelve months and when you add the two together you've got a look that's seriously stylish and up to date. This black, sequined midi is effortlessly glam, buy it <a href="https://www.oasis-stores.com/ie/new-in/clothing/sequin-pleated-midi-dress/071978.html?cgid=new-in-clothing&amp;fo_k=07f428be7f1507253d76c01c6336c816&amp;position=54&amp;dwvar_071978_color=01&amp;fo_c=1060&amp;fo_s=emarsys">here</a>.</p>

      <p>There is nothing we like more than wearing white in winter. It instantly adds elegance to any outfit. This sequin, balloon sleeved top is seriously sophisticated and would look fantastic paired with jeans. Alternatively,  double down on the sparkles and team it with a white sequined skirt.
