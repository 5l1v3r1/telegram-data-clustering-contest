      <h1>Stefanik raises more than $250,000 after soliciting donations on Hannity</h1>

      <p>Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik raised more than a quarter-million dollars in the short time after soliciting donations during her appearance on Sean Hannity's show.</p>
      <p>Stefanik, who has gained name recognition during the House Intelligence Committee's public hearings on impeachment, appeared on <i>Hannity </i>Thursday night and she asked for her supporters to donate to her.</p>
      <p>She began by reiterating that the "Democrats' case for impeachment is crumbling," but then pivoted, "Because Iâ€™ve been such an outspoken advocate for the facts, I have been attacked by the Hollywood Left, who have dumped millions into supporting my far-left Democratic opponent, which is why I need the American people to step up, donate at fightschiff.com to help me speak for the American people in my district."</p>

      <p>Slightly more than 30 minutes after her appeal, Stefanik tweeted, "We just raised 250K in 15 MINUTES," and then asked for more donations to reach half a million dollars.</p>
      <p>Hannity also labeled Stefanik a "new star of the Republican House of Representatives," and said that she's been doing a "phenomenal job" during the hearings. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/a-new-republican-star-is-born-trump-praises-elise-stefanik-amid-trashy-attacks">Trump has made similar comments</a>.</p>

      <p>In one particularly heated moment while former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testified last week, ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes tried to yield his time questioning the witness to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elise-stefanik-shows-how-to-be-gop-partisan-who-actually-asks-good-questions">Stefanik</a>, but her questions were interrupted by committee Chairman Adam Schiff. While Stefanik and Nunes expressed frustration with Schiff's refusal to allow her to question Yovanovitch, Schiff was following the House resolution used to dictate the rules for the inquiry.</p>
      <p>The fallout, which included <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-conway-under-fire-for-sharing-fake-photo-of-gop-congresswoman-and-calling-her-lying-trash">insults hurled by George Conway</a>, raised the profile of both Stefanik and that of her 2020 Democratic opponent, Tedra Cobb, who raised more than a million dollars last weekend.</p>
