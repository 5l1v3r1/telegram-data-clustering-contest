      <h1>‘He’s mummified!’ Crowd goes wild over star’s ridiculous tape-job</h1>

      <h3>Popular Wanderers fullback Daniel Georgievski is well known for his banter on and off the field, but he was struggling to talk after he copped a brutal blow to the mouth as the Wanderers lost to Melbourne City on Friday night.</h3>
      <p>After failing to stem the bleeding with gauze and foam, Georgievski was forced to resort to desperate measures – and debuted a fashionable new look.</p>
      <p>Watch his solution in the video below!</p>

      <p>Georgievski had been happy to continue playing with blood dripping from the wound, but referee Chris Beath forced him to receive more treatment after initial fixes failed.</p>
      <p>Desperate to get back into the action, the Wanderers’ star grabbed the tape and went to town on his own head. When he jogged back onto the pitch, the Parramatta faithful went wild, and no wonder – with his red blood and black tape, he was putting a fresh twist on the team colours.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time we’ve seen a dodgy taping job in the A-League, with Melbourne Victory’s keeper Lawrence Thomas on the receiving end of a set of studs to the face in the 2017/18 grand final.</p>
      <p>Newcastle striker Roy O’Donovan tried his hand – or foot – at karate, with Thomas left rather the worse for wear and needing a serious strapping job.</p>

      <p>Fox Football expert Adam Peacock was pitchside during Friday’s thriller between City and the Wanderers, and struggled to stifle his laugh at Georgievski’s unfortunate sense of style. “He’s come out mummified,” Peacock said, labelling it a “ridiculous look”.</p>
      <p>While the Wanderers didn’t manage to come out on top, Georgievski certainly takes first place for fashion on the field.</p>
