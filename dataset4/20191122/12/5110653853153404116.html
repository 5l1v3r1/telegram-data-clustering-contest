      <h1>Myles Garrett addresses report of Mason Rudolph racial slur: 'I know what I heard'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:27:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>Suspended Browns defensive end Myles Garrett responded Thursday night to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28130757/during-appeal-myles-garrett-accused-mason-rudolph-using-racial-slur">an ESPN report</a> that said he accused Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph of using a racial slur prior to a late-game fight between the teams last week.</p>
      <p>Garrett addressed the report with a short statement on Twitter. ESPN's Josina Anderson and Adam Schefter reported Garrett made the claim during an appeal Wednesday of his indefinite suspension by the league for ripping Rudolph's helmet off and then hitting Rudolph in the head with it.</p>
      <p>The NFL, in upholding the suspension, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-mason-rudolph-browns-steelers-brawl/cvj7kgdhkncm18mv7px1sdznd">announced Thursday</a> that it found no evidence Rudolph uttered a slur, and Rudolph, through a team spokesman, denied Garrett's reported allegation.</p>

      <p>Garrett also said he was at fault for losing his composure, repeating something he has said previously.</p>

      <p>Garrett (at least the remainder of the 2019 season, including possible playoff games), Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey (two games) and Browns lineman Larry Ogunjobi (one game) were suspended for their roles in the Nov. 14 melee in Cleveland. Rudolph was fined but not suspended.</p>
