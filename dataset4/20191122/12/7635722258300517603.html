        <b>The men found in the back of a truck on board a ferry making its way to Rosslare from France yesterday have applied for asylum in Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardaí said there were 14 men and two boys found on the ferry.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe they are Kurdish from the Middle East region; however, a formal identification process is ongoing.</p>
      <p>They are all described as being in ‘good health and good spirits’ after spending up to 12 hours in the truck container before being discovered by a ferry worker.</p>

      <p>The ferry was met by Gardaí and immigration officials at Rosslare and the men were transferred to a Dublin reception centre, where they spent the night.</p>
      <p>The men, aged between 20 and 40, have all applied for international protection and authorities are now working to find them accommodation while their applications are processed.</p>
      <p>The boys are being cared for by Tusla.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said they are continuing to carry out a criminal investigation into the discovery.</p>

      <p>The Minister of State for Immigration David Stanton told <i>Newstalk</i> that he is relieved there was no repeat of what happened in Essex – where 39 people were found dead in a trailer.</p>
      <p>“People smuggling is happening,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There are people who are desperate to better their lives. They are paying possibly their life savings – maybe even borrowing money – to try and give their children a better life.</p>
      <p>“And they are being victimised and exploited by unscrupulous and ruthless people.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we have seen fatalities; we have seen suffering and dying and suffocating in containers and again, we have seen what happened in Rosslare.”</p>
      <p>He said it is “extremely sad” that vulnerable people are driven to put their lvies at risk to flee their home countries.</p>
      <p>“We have seen already the international situation with millions of people displaced and desperate people trying to improve their lot and their situation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am glad to see that the people are OK, which is the main thing – and the Gardaí and immigration authorities will deal with this and see where they go from here.”</p>
      <p>The truck the men were found in is owned by a Wexford company and has been seized for a forensic examination.</p>
      <p>The driver is a man in his 50s who has lived in Ireland for over 25 years and is described as “long-term employee” of the company.</p>
      <p>The company and driver are “cooperating fully” with the investigation.</p>
