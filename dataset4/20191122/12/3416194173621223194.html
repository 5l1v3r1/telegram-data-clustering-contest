      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/nina-dobrev/"><b>Nina Dobrev</b></a> is opening up about her love for <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/beauty/"><b>Dior Beauty</b></a>, just after she was named the beauty brand’s newest ambassador.</p>
      <p>“I always looked up to Dior. It felt so timeless and classy and elegant in every way,” the 30-year-old actress shared with <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/makeup/a29859786/nina-dobrev-dior-beauty-interview/"><i>Harper’s Bazaar</i></a>. “I think the Miss Dior scent is what I always associated with that grace and timelessness. That was probably the first product I recognized, purchased, and aspired to as a little girl.”</p>
      <p><b>Nina </b>also opened up about her fave beauty items in the brand – she loves the “999″ Rouge Dior Ultra Care Lipstick, and Forever Foundation – and what she’s looking forward to in the coming year.</p>
      <p>“2019 was a whirlwind it had a lot of great moments and some tough moments and that’s all part of being a human,” she says. “I am looking forward to a fresh start and fresh slate, new year. I set some new intentions and start this partnership that I am super excited about with Dior and see what the future has in store.”</p>
