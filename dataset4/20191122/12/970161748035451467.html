      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/countdown/">Countdown</a> presenter and former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> contestant has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-claims-highlighting-jeremy-corbyns-history-racism-photoshopped-t-shirt-11194388/">since hit back at those criticising her</a>, defending herself via her official <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> account before stating yesterday that she would not be tweeting any further responses on the matter.</p>
      <h3>What did Rachel Riley tweet about Jeremy Corbyn?</h3>
      <p>Rachel Riley’s tweet containing the picture of her wearing the t-shirt in question was sent on November 19, the night of ITV’s leadership debate.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight. I don’t endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn. Please see my pinned thread if you still don’t understand why,’ the 33-year-old tweeted.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She caused uproar because on her top, the photo of Corbyn from the 1980s wearing a sign that read: ‘Defend the Right to Demonstrate Against Apartheid’ had been edited to read ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour.’</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-rileys-jeremy-corbyn-tweet-offensive-11192896/">Offended social media users</a> took to Twitter with one person saying that Riley’s actions amounted to ‘putting black history on the chopping block’ to fit her agenda while award-winning black feminist and LGBTQ activist Chardine Taylor Stone called the post ‘the most arrogant racist sh*t I have seen in a while’.</p>
      <p>Rachel, who is currently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/pregnant-rachel-riley-beams-cradles-baby-bump-amid-countdown-first-child-11010064/">expecting her first child with husband Pasha Kovalev</a>, responded to the backlash by saying she was ‘highlighting Jeremy Corbyn’s history of racism’ and by tweeting a link to a story about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nelson-mandela/">Nelson Mandela</a> allegedly declining to meet Corbyn’s anti-apartheid movement CLAAG (City of London Anti-Apartheid Movement).</p>

      <p>She wrote: ‘Without feeding individual ignorant trolls, this is why I have no qualms using this photo to highlight Corbyn’s racism. “He was actually a member of CLAAG… “a front” for a violence prone Trotskyist group known as the Revolutionary Communist Group (RCG)”.’</p>
      <p>‘Why would Nelson Mandela be advised by actual anti-apartheid heroes not to meet Corbyn and his extremist group if they were so fantastic?</p>

      <p>‘Because that’s more leftist revisionism. Along with inviting the IRA and friends from Hamas for tea in parliament somehow helps people,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>These claims were made in the book Youth Activism and Solidarity: The Non-Stop Picket Against Apartheid, written by academics Gavin Brown and Helen Yaffe, which claimed that an attempted meeting between CLAGG and Nelson Mandela never happened.</p>

      <p>Rachel followed up by tweeting multiple links to articles addressing the subject and news reports about the alleged snub from last year.</p>
      <p>The TV star concluded her thread of tweets saying: ‘Trying to brand me as racist for this, whist lauding themselves as anti-racist heroes, shows just how little regard many people have for anti-Jewish racism, and why I and many others speak so loudly. It’s a hatred which unites the far right, far left and is having a resurgence.’</p>

      <p>This morning, Friday 22 November, Rachel tweeted again saying: ‘Thanks for all the lovely messages of support, &amp; all the silent supporters who’ve followed me, means a lot. Shows how counterproductive nasty pile-ons actually are. I made this promise, I intend to keep it. If this is the price to raise awareness then sobeit. Lots of love.’</p>

      <p>Rachel’s most recent tweet refers to a post she published on October 29 which reads: ‘As we edge towards a December general election, a heartfelt promise: I will do everything in my power to try to ensure my baby, Jewish by blood, will not be born under an antisemitic government. I hope this will never happen, please use your vote wisely.’</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11812730/Jeremy-Corbyn-denies-knowing-Muslim-firebrand-who-condones-killing-British-soldiers.html">said previously</a> that claims he is racist and anti-Semite are ‘deeply offensive’ and speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr program last year insisted: ‘I’ve spent my whole life exposing racism in any form.’</p>
      <p>The Labour leader also spoke out in October of this year, when in Brussels for a meeting of European socialist leaders, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/jeremy-corbyn-defends-record-on-anti-semitism-after-mp-quits/">telling press</a> outside: ‘I have taken the most resolute action possible of any party leader to deal with issues of anti-Semitism or racism of any form in our party.’</p>
