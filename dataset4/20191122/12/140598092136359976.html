      <h1>Bayern Munich want to offer Mauricio Pochettino swift return to management after Spurs sacking</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:48:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/matt-law/" target="_blank">Matt Law</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino will be offered a swift return to management by Bayern Munich following his Tottenham Hotspur sacking this week.</p>
      <p>Bayern want to hold talks with Pochettino, even though they are aware he might prefer to wait until the New Year before considering what his next job will be.</p>
      <p>That would suit the German club, who have told caretaker manager Hansi Flick that he will be in temporary charge until at least Christmas and possibly longer.</p>
      <p>Bayern’s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, is keen to speak to Pochettino and is believed to be willing to let the Argentine decide when he would like to take over.</p>
      <p>Pochettino may want to see what happens at Real Madrid and Manchester United, two clubs who have approached him in the past, but Bayern would be a tempting proposition.</p>
      <p>Bayern would represent a good chance for Pochettino to immediately add silverware to his CV and also give him some of the spending power he never had at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Flick was put in temporary charge after Bayern sacked Niko Kovac, who masterminded the stunning 7-2 Champions League victory over Pochettino’s Tottenham at the start of last month.</p>

      <p>Despite some encouraging results, Flick has not been given a permanent contract which has allowed Bayern to keep their long-term options open.</p>
      <p>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Bayern’s CEO, told the club’s annual general meeting: “I have held talks with Hansi and he told me reporters keep asking him if he will be in charge for the next game. I can say that until further notice he will be in charge at least until Christmas, or maybe even beyond.”</p>
      <p>Bayern are third in the Bundesliga table, four points behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach, and are top of Group B in the Champions League ahead of Spurs.</p>
      <p>Despite leaving Tottenham in 14th place in the Premier League table and being replaced by Jose Mourinho, Pochettino’s reputation in the game remains very high.</p>
      <p>It is recognised that he worked miracles in difficult circumstances to take Spurs into the Champions League and reach last year’s final.</p>
      <p>His appointment at Bayern would be popular with the club’s players, particularly on-loan midfielder Philippe Coutinho, who he managed at Espanyol.</p>
      <p>Pohettino wanted to sign Coutinho for Tottenham this summer and, on the Brazilian, he said: “As with most Brazilians, Philippe has a special magic in his feet. He has that same quality as Ronaldinho and Messi.</p>
      <p>“Aside from the magic that he has, he also has an amazing work rate and that makes us doubt whether he fits the mould of a typical Brazilian player or a European one because his work ethic is outstanding.”</p>
