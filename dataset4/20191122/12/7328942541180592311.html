      <p>The responsibility of taking birth control may become a shared one in as soon as six months' time. Scientists from the <a href="https://www.icmr.nic.in/">Indian Council of Medical Research</a> (ICMR) have just successfully completed clinical trials of the world's first-ever male contraceptive injection.</p>
      <p>All that awaits the birth control's destiny is for the authorities to approve the drug. </p>

      </p>
      <p>If all goes well, the product could be on sale to men in just <b>six months</b>, and its effects will last as long as <b><a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-closer-to-world-s-first-male-contraceptive-injection/story-o3lTFLnCkKHpuEDNNqrEnO.html">13 years</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Finally, the weight of bearing the exclusive duty of taking birth control can be lifted from women's shoulders. Can you hear women across the world cheering in unison? </p>
      <h3>The new male birth control</h3>
      <p>The ICMR, a government-funded biomedical research agency, has created this first-of-its-kind male contraceptive as a replacement for surgical vasectomies. Currently, this is the only method for male sterilization that exists today. </p>
      <p>According to the ICMR, the drug's effect would last as long as<b> 13 years</b> once injected, after which its potency wanes. </p>
      <p><a href="https://scoop.upworthy.com/worlds-first-male-contraceptive-injection-six-months">Dr. R.S. Sharma</a>, a senior scientist with ICMR, said "The product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending with the Drugs Controller. The trials are over, including extended, phase <b>3</b> clinical trials for which<b> 303 candidates</b> were recruited with<b> 97.3%</b> success rate and no reported side-effects."</p>
      <p>Those are rather high and positive results. </p>
      <p><a href="https://scoop.upworthy.com/worlds-first-male-contraceptive-injection-six-months">Sharma added that</a> "The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive."</p>
      <p>Hear, hear. </p>

      <h3>What is the contraceptive, and where is it injected?</h3>
      <p>The contraceptive is a <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/tv-and-film-worlds-first-male-contraceptive-jab-could-be-available-in-six-months-20191120">polymer</a> called <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-closer-to-world-s-first-male-contraceptive-injection/story-o3lTFLnCkKHpuEDNNqrEnO.html">styrene maleic anhydride</a> and it's injected into the vas deferens — the tube that contains sperm near the testicles — by a registered nurse. </p>
      <p>Before any males out there faint or run for the hills with the mention of an injection near their prized possessions; rest assured that before the injection happens a local anesthetic is administered to the area.</p>
      <p>The story of male contraception is not a new one. In fact, it dates back to the 1970s when Prof. S.K. Gupta from the <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/MA/pages/People+Faculty+Shiv_Kumar_Gupta.html">Indian Institute of Technology</a> first developed the polymer. </p>
      <p>Since 1984, the ICMR has been exhaustively researching ways to turn the polymer into a drug for mass use. Now, <b>35 years later</b>, it's finally passed its myriad testing phases and is ready for use.</p>

      <p>Drugs Controller General of India, <a href="https://scoop.upworthy.com/worlds-first-male-contraceptive-injection-six-months">V.G. Somani</a>, stated "I'd say it will still take about <b>six to seven months</b> for all the approvals to be granted before the product can be manufactured." </p>
      <p>It looks like what Prof. Gupta discovered in the 1970s may at long last be ready for use.</p>
