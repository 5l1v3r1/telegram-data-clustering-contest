      <p>A medical examiner has determined Ronald Wayne White had been dead in the apartment since communications with his mother in New York ended abruptly three years ago, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/navy-veteran-found-in-his-apartment-had-been-dead-for-three-years-medical-examiner-says/287-8674f689-7c2e-46c2-9ead-9a612576a760">WFAA reported</a>.</p>
      <p>"My son would call me at least twice a month," Doris Stevens <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/navy-veteran-found-in-his-apartment-had-been-dead-for-three-years-medical-examiner-says/287-8674f689-7c2e-46c2-9ead-9a612576a760">told WFAA,</a> adding, "He would call me from Egypt. He would call me from the Philippines. He would call me right from Dallas.”</p>
      <p>White, who worked for a defense contractor following his military service, traveled frequently and would have been 51 at the time of his death, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/navy-veteran-found-in-his-apartment-had-been-dead-for-three-years-medical-examiner-says/287-8674f689-7c2e-46c2-9ead-9a612576a760">the news station </a>reported.</p>
      <p>An officer with the DeSoto Police Department <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/navy-veteran-found-dead-in-apartment-3-years-later/">told People</a> magazine White’s body was found last week on the kitchen floor of his DeSoto Town Center apartment when maintenance workers entered the premises to investigate a water issue.</p>
      <p>“Maintenance men were trying to get into the apartment because they noticed that the water usage was non-existent for some time, so they suspected that there was some type of issue with the water main,” the officer <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/navy-veteran-found-dead-in-apartment-3-years-later/">told People</a>.</p>
      <p>Stevens, who lives in Long Island, New York, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/navy-veteran-found-in-his-apartment-had-been-dead-for-three-years-medical-examiner-says/287-8674f689-7c2e-46c2-9ead-9a612576a760">told WFAA</a> multiple police departments explained to her over the years that because White was an adult who was known to travel frequently they could not pursue her concerns as a missing persons case.</p>
      <p>“My biggest question is, how in the world could my son have been dead in that apartment and nobody knows anything?” Stevens told the news station.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/navy-veteran-found-in-his-apartment-had-been-dead-for-three-years-medical-examiner-says/287-8674f689-7c2e-46c2-9ead-9a612576a760">According to WFAA</a>, DeSoto police have determined White had a month-to-month lease on the apartment paid through an automatic withdrawal from an account linked to his Navy retirement. The new, well-insulated dwelling was located on the third floor with all windows locked and sealed tightly.</p>
      <p>"The way he was found, the way the apartment was arranged and so forth, there was zero indication of foul play," Pete Schulte, a detective with the DeSoto Police Department, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/navy-veteran-found-in-his-apartment-had-been-dead-for-three-years-medical-examiner-says/287-8674f689-7c2e-46c2-9ead-9a612576a760">told the news station</a>. <br/>In addition, police investigators found diabetes medications inside the apartment – dated 2016 – and the family confirmed White was a diabetic, People reported.</p>
