      <h3>Windows 10X won't be useless after all, with Windows app support basically confirmed</h3>
      <p>Via containers, according to a job description on LinkedIn</p>

      <p>We’ve seen another, this time much clearer, indication that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/leak-reveals-windows-10x-a-new-operating-system-for-dual-screen-devices">Windows 10X</a> will support Win32 apps – meaning normal <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review">Windows 10</a> apps – so in other words, the OS won’t be limited to just running certain applications (like only apps from the Microsoft Store, for example).</p>
      <p>This comes courtesy of a Microsoft job listing on LinkedIn, as spotted by Windows Latest. The job in question is a principal software engineering lead with the Containers team within the Azure Core OS Kernel team.</p>

      <p>At one point, it mentions: “These technologies form the basis for Store-delivered Win32 applications, Windows Server Containers, Windows Defender Application Guard, Windows Sandbox, and Win32 application support for Windows 10X on dual-screen devices like Surface Neo.”</p>
      <p>So there it is – right at the end, we have a crystal clear and specific mention that Win32 application support will be provided for Windows 10X via containers.</p>
      <h4>Happy coexistence</h4>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-10x-for-dual-screen-devices-could-run-regular-windows-applications-as-well">previous leak</a> hinted that Windows 10X would offer the ‘coexistence’ of both PWA (Progressive Web App) and Win32 versions of Microsoft Office, so this certainly seems to back that up.</p>
      <p>Although of course we should remember that this is far from official confirmation from Microsoft that Windows 10X will indeed come with support for full-fat Windows 10 desktop applications.</p>
      <p>There’s always the possibility that someone has got something wrong in writing the job listing, or that particular bit of text is copied and pasted from a now outdated document pertaining to the OS – who knows. The point is that we shouldn’t take it for granted until we hear from Microsoft itself.</p>
      <p>However, it certainly seems that the plan is for Windows 10X to support Win32 apps as well as UWP applications. And indeed this makes sense given that we’ve also heard a rumor (citing leaked Microsoft documentation) that Windows 10X isn’t exclusively for dual-screen devices, and will <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-10x-leak-shows-its-not-just-for-dual-screen-devices-itll-run-on-traditional-laptops-too">come to traditional laptop form factors in the future</a>.</p>
