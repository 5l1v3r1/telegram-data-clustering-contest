      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have reportedly joined the chase for talented Newcastle United youngster Bobby Clark.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7714221/Tottenham-join-race-sign-Newcastle-starlet-Bobby-Clark.html">According to The Daily Mail</a>, Spurs are the latest club to sound out 14-year-old Clark, who is rated as the Magpies’ ‘best schoolboy prospect’ by first-team manager Steve Bruce.</p>
      <p>Clark recently caught the media’s attention for debuting for the club’s U18s.</p>

      <p>He is apparently all set to feature for the England U15s next month against the Republic of Ireland and Turkey.</p>
      <p>The Mail say the exciting youngster – son of former Newcastle star and current Blyth Spartans manager Lee Clark – is also being watched by Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Apparently Clark – who was handed scholarship earlier this year – would prefer to remain with his boyhood club, but Spurs are ‘frontrunners’ should he and his family decide on a change of environment.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – One for the future</h3>
      <p>Clark appears to have a very bright future ahead of him in football, and will be being advised carefully amid all the reported interest from other big clubs.</p>

      <p>Certainly Spurs will sound like an attractive proposition given the club’s advocacy for young players.</p>
      <p>And, of course, the brand new stadium as a possible future home ground is bound to be a huge selling point.</p>
