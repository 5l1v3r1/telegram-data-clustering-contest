      <p>It‚Äôs hard to understand why <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> is shooting itself in the foot like this, more so if you remember that a luxury sedan with the engine from a half-ton pickup isn‚Äôt exactly the most prestigious combination out there. The 392 would be a better fit in the U.S. of A. thanks to the performance offensive of the Dodge brand and SRT go-faster division.</p>
      <p>Turning our attention to the Wild Yellow-painted Chrysler 300 SRT Pacer, the Australia-exclusive build pays tribute to the Valiant Pacer from five decades ago. The 6.4-liter blunderbuss is tuned to develop 350 <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt"><u>kW</u></a> and 637 Nm at the crankshaft, the equivalent to 470 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. Curiously enough, the 392 HEMI in R/T Scat Pack models from Dodge boast 485 horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque in the U.S.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúInconsistency‚Äù</i> is the word that best defines Chrysler‚Äôs strategy this day and age, and the marketing for the special edition is somewhat of a blunder as well. We‚Äôre told that<i> ‚Äúthe SRT Pacer aims to provide an affordable high-performance large sedan that resonates with Australian motoring enthusiasts,‚Äù </i>yet FoMoCo and General Motors were the big players Down Under back in the days when the Falcon and Monaro were produced locally.</p>
      <p>Chrysler can only dream of getting Aussie car lovers excited about the 392 HEMI as much as they are about the Barra inline-six and LS small-block V8 engine families. Adding insult to injury, Chrysler is the first of the Big Three in Detroit to switch from manufacturer to importer in the Oz. Chrysler Australia, Ltd. ceased to exist in 1980, bought by Mitsubishi.</p>
      <p>On an ending note, the Valiant Pacer built by Chrysler in Adelaide came with an unbecoming engine for a performance car. The 225-cu.in Slant Six is the culprit, replaced in 1970 by the HEMI-6 engine in the VG-model Valiant. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>20 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>In true celebration of its Australian heritage, Chrysler Australia has created a custom, one of a kind Chrysler 300 SRT Pacer tribute car, celebrating the 50th Anniversary of an Australian motoring icon, the 1969 Valiant Pacer.</p>
        <p>Celebrating Australia‚Äôs love of fast, rear wheel drive four door sedans, Chrysler Australia is reintroducing the Pacer nameplate, paying homage to the original with a custom wrapped high performance sedan based on the Chrysler 300 SRT Core.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to bring to life a modern interpretation of an Australian classic, the Chrysler 300 SRT Pacer tribute car,‚Äù said Guillaume Drelon, Director of Product, Chrysler Australia.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúHighlighting the signature details of the original, the Pacer tribute takes inspiration from the iconic design cues of the celebrated 1969 Valiant Pacer.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Featuring a full vehicle wrap replicating the original Wild Yellow body colour, the Pacer tribute is adorned with black side stripes and ‚ÄòPacer 392‚Äô decals on front quarter panels and rear boot lid.</p>
        <p>The tribute Pacer‚Äôs 20-inch Black Noise Alloy Wheels are enhanced with the striking red stripe seen on the wheels of the 1969 Pacer, matching the red front splitter decal with the Pacer logo and boot lid decal.</p>
        <p>The 1969 Chrysler Valiant Pacer was built exclusively for the Australian market at the Chrysler factory in Adelaide, South Australia. Targeted at Australians looking for a performance car, the Valiant Pacer was fitted with a 225 cubic inch slant six engine producing 130kW, paired to a 3 speed manual gearbox.</p>
        <p>Originally available in three colours ‚Äì Wild Yellow, Blue and Red ‚Äì the Valiant Pacer featured black exterior side stripes and red highlights accenting the grille and boot lid. Signifying the performance credentials of the Valiant Pacer‚Äôs modified six-cylinder engine, the exterior styling was further decorated with its iconic ‚ÄòPacer 225‚Äô decals.</p>
        <p>Today, the Wild Yellow Chrysler 300 SRT Pacer tribute car is powered by an even stronger HEMI V8 that produces a booming 350kW and 637Nm of Torque. All details from the original have been meticulously reproduced. The Pacer 225 decals turned into Pacer 392, which represents the cubic inch of the 6.4 V8 powertrain. The high-powered engine is paired with the advanced TorqueFlight ZF-8-speed automatic gearbox with Rotary E-shift, Launch Control and Rear Wheel Drive.</p>
        <p>To further celebrate the iconic Australian-made 1969 Chrysler Valiant Pacer, Chrysler Australia is excited to announce that a limited edition production variant will be released soon.</p>
