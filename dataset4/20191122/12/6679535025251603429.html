      <p>The railways has significantly increased the frequency of trains in Kashmir from Friday and extended daily run-time to allow more passengers to use the service, officials said here.</p>
      <p>There will be 14 train services on Friday and 16 services daily from Saturday onwards between various stations on the railway line in Kashmir, they said.</p>
      <p>Due to the demand of commuters, the railways increased the frequency of trains and also extended the timing of the service between different stations on the Baramulla-Banihal railway line, the officials said.</p>
      <p>The rail service was partially resumed in Kashmir — between Baramulla and Srinagar — on November 12 and later fully on November 17.</p>
      <p>The service was resumed over three months after it was suspended on August 3 due to security reasons. The move came days before the Centre announced its decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 and to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories.</p>
      <p>After it was resumed, the railways said there would be only two services of the train every day and the timing would be from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. due to security considerations.</p>
      <p>They said the now timing of the train service has been extended as well and the first service will start at 8.30 a.m. and the trains would be operated till 5 p.m.</p>
      <p>This would benefit the people and allow more commuters to use the service, the officials said.</p>
