      <p>Market observers and financial analysts today are lining up to look at the Chief Governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon, Riad Salameh, in the eye and tell him: I told you so! In the back of their minds is attributing most, if not all, of the ills infesting the financial landscape on the policies (past &amp; present) of the central bank and characterizing them as “corruption-driven” not “correction-driven” monetary policies!What those market observers and financial analysts fail to acknowledge is that the Central Bank doesn’t decide the size of government spending, nor any other aspect of fiscal policy. In addition, the monetary authority is managing an M1 money supply with balances denominated in a number of currencies and an un-satiated appetite of its statesmen!The 2019 Lebanon financial crisis is the consequence of a crisis of “trust” between the majority of the Lebanese people and their government, and of “confidence” in the current government’s willingness and ability to introduce the necessary reforms. All of this couldn’t happen without ripple effects. Understandably, the financial community got its share of the pains.  Despite the apparent independence of monetary authorities in Lebanon, it’s common knowledge that the appointment of state officials is governed by political considerations, and politicians are, in their capacity as private citizens, dominant players in the commercial banking landscape as equity holders, and key (Liability &amp; Asset) clients. Today, the financial community in Lebanon is exposed to:1. Overleveraged real estate development loans, and their illegitimate child, the housing loans.2. The mounting Lebanese government-debt crisis.3. The downgrading of government bonds by international credit rating agencies.4. The government’s consequential deteriorating ability to finance its expenditures.5. The confusion (or reluctance), to date, over the government’s need to restructure the troubled financial sector.6. Abuse by politicians for purely personal gains.  A bank collapse would result in billions of dollars in depositors’ bailouts to be paid, an amount which can potentially be much larger than Lebanon’s GDP - an unthinkable option! A rescue plan has become necessary.I propose two rescue measures; the “Soft Rescue” and “Hard Rescue” of banks operating in Lebanon; both of which build on burden sharing.The Soft Rescue has become the talk of the town in recent days. It’s the internal controls imposed by banks on (i) withdrawals from and (ii) transfers out of dollar-denominated deposits. Most citizens, even those who have little to show for in terms of money in a bank, have been hysterical over these measures.Don’t ask what banks are doing! I genuinely ask everyone to consider this: imagine what would have happened had banks acted in ways that utterly accommodate every request from their clients! This would lead to a total and quick collapse!  Yes, these controls:i. Have not been enacted into laws.ii. Have been introduced more in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding.iii. Are mostly imposed on panic-driven household withdrawals.iv. Are not at the discretion of the Central Bank (BDL).v. Are circumstantial, and easily revocable.vi. Are designed to help us ride the storm, and avoid the otherwise total collapse had we reacted to the storm with a 'laissez faire' attitude.vii. Are based on burden sharing.  Should our Lebanese politicians insist on being stubborn, the “Soft Rescue” efforts can’t last indefinitely, and then there will be a need for a “Hard Rescue.” This Phase will require soliciting the help of Lebanese and friends of Lebanon from the Arab and international communities. The international bailout could come from (or through) the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), just to name a few.If the soft rescue does not materialize into a complete recovery, the hard rescue becomes mandatory, but it will not, and cannot, be at no cost! The success of the hard rescue is contingent upon serious reforms. Lebanon must agree to:  a) Produce a more responsible body of Fiscal Authority by eradicating corruption and waste of government resources, encouraging accountability and transparency, etc.b) Consolidate the banking landscape (Mergers &amp; Acquisitions); Lebanon is definitely overbanked.c) Institute the legal framework to permit the issuance of financial instruments that the private sector (Large Corporations and Small &amp; Medium Enterprises) can use to finance their operations (short- and long-term) as a viable alternative to bank financing.d) Impose a one-time charge on bank deposits to be used in the bailout; or, alternatively, invite depositors and encourage them to participate in the bailout by transforming a portion of their deposits to equity with an option to redeem in 3 to 5 years.e) Consider the roll-over of maturing Treasury Bills and maturing bonds held by creditors; preferably the portfolio held by domestic creditors.f) Bring down the funding need for bank recapitalization. Despite the magnitude of the 2008 financial crisis and its domino effects, the Lebanese economy was spared either by design or by coincident; it was never investigated. That is, there were no lessons learned for our policy-makers to look at and wise-up from. The Lebanese crisis today is not a financial one, but it’s one with financial implications. It’s the result of policy mistakes and a failure of collective responsibility, as well as an illustration of what bad policies can do and could do if they’re not corrected.It’s still not too late to charter the soft rescue and avoid the problems we’re facing today all together… provided our politicians wise up!-----<i><b>Mohammad Ibrahim Fheili is a risk &amp; capacity building expert.</b></i> Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1072963-lebanese-mark-their-very-own-independence-day-across-the-nation">Lebanese mark their very own Independence Day across the nation </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1073113-happy-independence-day-dad"> Happy Independence Day, Dad </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1072279-imf-or-godot-whos-better-for-lebanon-in-todays-sudden-stop-event"> IMF or Godot… who’s better for Lebanon in today’s sudden stop event?</a></p>
