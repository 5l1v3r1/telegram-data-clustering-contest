      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/mabel">Mabel</a> has shared a new <a href="http://nme.com/tag/christmas">Christmas</a>(ish) song, ‘Loneliest Time Of Year’.</p>
      <p>The new song, shared ahead of a 2020 UK headline tour, doesn’t particularly see her getting into the festive spirit.</p>
      <p><i>“sorry I’m not so merry / but I feel like this yearly,” </i>she sings on the track. Listen to it below.</p>

      <p>The new song follows <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/mabel-high-expectations-album-review">Mabel’s debut album <i>High Expectations</i></a>, which came out in August. A three-star review of the album from <i>NME</i>‘s Hannah Mylrea said: “‘High Expectations’ is a solid album, with some extraordinarily good pop songs on it, yet it feels like something’s missing.”</p>
      <p>The release of ‘Loneliest Time Of Year’ comes ahead of a series of UK tour dates this week, which <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mabel-reschedules-summer-tour-dates-due-to-illness-2534311">had to be rescheduled after the singer fell ill earlier this year</a>.</p>
