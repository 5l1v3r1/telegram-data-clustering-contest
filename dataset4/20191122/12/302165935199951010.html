      <p>TAWAU, Nov 22 — Police today warned the public against distributing and storing the alleged sex video involving seven Sijil Persekolahan Malaysia (SPM) candidates and a form two female student at a secondary school here last Friday (Nov 15).</p>
      <p>Tawau district police chief ACP Peter Umbuas said they have received a public complaint about the video and the investigation was underway.</p>
      <p>“The video has been handed over to the forensic department for further investigation to determine its authenticity,” he said at a press conference here today.</p>
      <p>He said people who were found to be disseminating the sex video could face legal action under Section 233 (1) (a) of the Multimedia Communications Act 1998 which provides for a fine not exceeding RM50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both and shall also be liable to a further fine of RM1,000 for every day or part of the day during the which the offence is continued after conviction.</p>
      <p>“For having possession of a pornographic video, the public can be charged under Section 292 of the Penal Code which provides for a maximum jail term of three years or a fine or both, if convicted,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also hoped that the public would not disturb the witnesses including the victim as well as the suspects as all the accused were sitting for the SPM examinations.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, the police have also worked with relevant parties including the Social Welfare Department (SWD) to assist the victim who is said to be a smart student which include the placement of new school suitable for her,” he said.</p>
      <p>Asked if the victim had been promised a smartphone by the suspects if they had sex, Peter said he had not received such information.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Peter also directed a school liaison officer at the Tawau district police headquarters to go down to the field to explain criminal offences especially sexual crime involving secondary school students.</p>
      <p>On Nov 15, police arrested seven male students, all aged 17, for allegedly raping a form two girl at the school’s switch room, here.</p>
      <p>All the suspects were detained and remanded until Nov 18 before being released on police bail to enable them to sit for SPM examinations. — Bernama</p>
