      <h2>Sharad Pawar announces the Sena chief’s nomination; talks on government formation continue.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:01:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Alok-Deshpande-256/" target="_blank">Alok Deshpande</a></address>
      <p>Almost a month after the results of the Maharashtra Assembly polls were announced and following two weeks of intense deliberations over formation of a State government, the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress on Friday unanimously agreed that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray would be the Chief Minister of the new government.</p>
      <p>Senior Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut confirmed on Friday night that Uddhav Thackeray had agreed to lead the new government.</p>
      <p>The talks between the three parties, however, remained inconclusive and an announcement of the formal alliance, called the ‘Mahavikas aghadi’ was delayed with leaders saying that certain small things yet to be sorted out.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar had stated earlier in the evening that the three parties were unanimous that Mr. Thackeray should lead the government.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the press after a marathon meeting at the Nehru Centre, Mr. Pawar said “There will be a press conference tomorrow (Saturday) after everything is finalised.”</p>

      <p>“We have unanimously agreed that Uddhav Thackeray will lead the government,” he said, while leaving the meeting.</p>
      <p>Mr Thackeray who left a few minutes after the NCP chief said that the discussions were positive. “The discussions on all the subjects was positive,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have sorted out the majority of the issues and certain small issues are yet to be solved. Once those are cleared all three parties will hold joint press conference,” said Mr. Thackeray.</p>
      <p>The meeting at the Nehru Centre was the first high level meeting between the top leaders of all three parties including Mr. Pawar and the NCP's core committee, Mr. Thackeray, his son Aaditya and Sena leaders and the Congress contingent led by senior leader Ahmed Patel.</p>

      <p>Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan also echoed that the talks were positive.</p>
      <p>“This was the first meeting between the leaders of all three parties. All major issues have been cleared, but when you are on the verge of forming the government there has to be discussion from top to bottom,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the talks between the three parties were not limited to who should hold the post of chief minister but also about the distribution of portfolios, chairmanships of various government corporations, upcoming council and Rajya Sabha polls.</p>
      <p>A senior Congress leader at discussions said it took two days for Congress and NCP to reach a consensus. “How do you expect that three parties will sort differences within a day? The talks will continue and once we reach final conclusion, only then we can tell you the details of our discussions,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Raut told mediapersons that, “There will be a Shiv Sena CM for five years; all three parties have agreed to that. Sena has taken this decision for Maharashtra's pride and to give Maharashtra a strong leadership. Maharashtra wants Uddhavji to become CM. Shiv Sena has kept CM post with itself on its own strength.”</p>
