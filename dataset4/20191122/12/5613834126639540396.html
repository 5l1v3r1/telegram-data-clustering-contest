      <h1>Rumour: ‘Resident Evil 3: Nemesis’ Remake Coming in 2020?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:58:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Grab your salt lick, this is a big one.</p>
      <p>After the <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3562363/capcoms-resident-evil-2-remake-sells-4-2-million-copies-devil-may-cry-5-2-1-million/">obvious success</a> of the <b><i>Resident Evil 2</i></b> remake, the question on everybody’s mind was if Capcom would complete the trilogy of remakes. Well, according to one source, if the rumour turns out to be true, that appears to be the case.</p>
      <p>According to reports from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBrLDX8SCM">Spawn Wave</a>, Capcom will be releasing a remake of <b><i>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</i></b> in 2020. In case you’re wondering just why we should trust this source (I know I am), Spawn Wave was the first to report on From Software’s <b><i>Elden Ring</i></b> before its official announcement at E3 2019.</p>
      <p>In spite of that, this is again only a rumour at this point. However, it’d be a no-brainer for Capcom to go ahead with a <i>Nemesis</i> remake, since come on, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3542722/resident-evil-2-review/"><i>RE2</i> is amazing</a>. Obviously, Capcom hasn’t commented on this, but if this turns out to be true, then get ready.</p>
      <p>Currently, the only <i>Resident Evil</i> project that we know of that’s in development right now is <b><i>Project Resistance</i></b>, which doesn’t have a release date as of yet, but is in development for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
