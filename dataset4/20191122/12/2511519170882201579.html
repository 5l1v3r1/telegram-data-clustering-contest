      <h1>Pakistan feminism panel attracts backlash after no women included</h1>
      <h2>The all-male line up was to "share views" on feminism </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:15:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Moya Lothian-McLean</a></address>
      <p>The Arts Council of Pakistan has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50506965">forced to alter</a> a panel event on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Feminism">feminism</a> after it was revealed the line-up included no women. </p>
      <p>Outcry on <a href="https://twitter.com/erumrum/status/1196901499336626183">social media</a> forced the organisation to add two women guests to the panel, which is planned to take place on 22 November in Karachi. </p>
      <p>The event has also been renamed from “Feminism: The Other Perspective” to “Understanding Feminism”. </p>
      <p>"This is such a horror," <a href="https://twitter.com/oil_is_opium/status/1196775448040148993">wrote one Twitter user</a>. "Before women feminists find platforms and political voice, men helping themselves to more. Opposite of feminism."</p>
      <p>"These men wanna give the ‘other perspective’ on feminism,"<a href="https://twitter.com/Aimanfrizvi/status/1196749981991997440">added writer </a>Aiman Rizvi.</p>
      <p>"Maybe the intention here was to use their privilege for the cause - but this isn’t how allyship works. This is, however, what taking up space looks like. It is also what men exploiting feminism to build capital looks like."</p>
      <p>However, the inclusion of feminist Mehtab Akbar Rashdi and journalist Quatrina Hosain still means that women make up less than half of the panel.</p>
      <p>Originally, five men were lined up to speak at the event, apparently to “share views on feminism,” explained organisers. </p>
      <p>"Our purpose was to get men having decision-making powers in major media houses and those with a following to talk about their understanding of feminism,” discussion host Uzma al-Karim told BBC Urdu.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to register their perception because they were in a position to influence public opinion. And that's why we called it 'the other perspective'."</p>
      <p>However, human rights activist Jibran Nasir, a speaker on the panel, said he’d been misinformed regarding the purpose of the event. </p>
      <p>"I was informed the panel is about men talking to other men about rethinking masculinity and why [we] as men we need feminism”, Nasir <a href="https://twitter.com/MJibranNasir/status/1196916890289016832">tweeted</a>, along with a longer clarification. </p>
      <p>“It wasn't to explain feminism or talk about women’s issues as men.” </p>
      <p>Pakistan is one of the lowest ranked countries in the world for gender equality. </p>
      <p>In 2018 it ranked 148 out of 149 countries in the World Economic Forum’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1452284">gender parity report</a>. </p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/pakistan-makes-uneven-progress-in#.Xde-kej7S70">strides towards equality</a> are slowly being made, with more women running for political office than ever before in the past two years, and female education rates increasing.</p>
