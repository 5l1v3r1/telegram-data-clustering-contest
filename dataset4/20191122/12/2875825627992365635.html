      <p>Former I'm A Celebrity winner Georgia 'Toff' Toffolo has hit out at Jacqueline Jossa and Nadine Coyle for sparking the first camp fight.</p>
      <p>The Made in Chelsea star, 25, branded the girls "naughty" after they refused to put their names in the hat to be sent to the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>Speaking on This Morning, Toff said that she had been "shouting at the TV" over the awkward moment.</p>
      <p>After achieving eight stars in their Bushtucker Trial, new campmates Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment became Outlaws and were sent to the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>

      <p>The main camp had the opportunity to be "good, bad or downright ugly" - and either keep all the food themselves, or choose to feed the outlaws with their share of food.</p>
      <p>The twist with the second option was that two campmates would have to join the outlaws in the Jailhouse - but tempers flared over a difference in opinion.</p>
      <p>When former footballer Ian suggested that they draw straws, they all picked bottles out named water bottles to see who would go.</p>

      <p>However Jacqueline and Nadine both refused to go, prompting discord in camp.</p>
      <p>"As a former campmate I think my judgement might be a bit different to everyone," Toff said. "I thought it was really naughty of them!</p>
      <p>"Because you work as a team in there and I know it sounds so silly, but your day revolves around working together.</p>
      <p>However host Ruth said that she loved their "honesty".</p>
      <p>"It is, but I'm just not sure about that," Toff said.</p>
