      <h1>Report: Lucas Moura excited for Mourinho era after struggles under Pochettino</h1>

      <p>Tottenham Hotspur winger Lucas Moura is said to be relishing working with Jose Mourinho, after the Portuguese replaced Mauricio Pochettino as manager earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Spurs made their decision to sack the Argentine after over five years in charge following a poor start to the 2019/20 season that has seen them win just three Premier League games.</p>

      <p>Following the initial shock of everything, a lot of supporters appear to now be on board with the 58-year-old’s appointment, and are hoping to see him get the best out of their currently underperforming players.</p>
      <p>Under Pochettino this term, there have been a number of disappointments in the squad.</p>
      <p>Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have all been poor.</p>
      <p>For Brazilian Moura, it’s been a frustrating term with Pochettino having used him mainly as a substitute.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.uol.com.br/esporte/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2019/11/21/lucas-aposta-em-fa-mourinho-para-se-recuperar-no-tottenham-apos-crise.htm">According to UOL</a>, sources close to the player have claimed his relationship with the 47 -year-old had become ‘worn out’ following his seeming lack of faith in the South American.</p>
      <p>Being left on the bench for the Champions League final against Liverpool was a particularly big blow, which made things slightly frosty between them going forwards.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Moura has been buoyed by the arrival of Mourinho and believes it will see him get the game time he deserves.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Moura and Mourinho a perfect match?</h3>
      <p>Pochettino did seem to underuse Moura at times in the last couple of years.</p>

      <p>The star tends to always look dangerous when he comes off the bench, and does bring different qualities than the club’s other attacking players.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Mourinho, who wanted to sign him for Manchester United, will be the man to elevate Moura to another level by making him a regular in the starting XI.</p>
