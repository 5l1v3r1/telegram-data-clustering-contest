      <h1>Robbie Williams tells Ryan Tubridy of the terrifying moment he realised he had to get sober</h1>
      <h2>The dad of three admitted it was "stop drinking or die"</h2>

      <p>Robbie Williams says Christmas wasn’t always a merry time of year for him, especially when he was forced to quit drinking to save his life almost 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>The former Take That singer admitted to “falling out of love with <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> ” 19 years ago when he “had to give up drinking” as a matter of life or death.</p>
      <p>“I haven't had a drink for 19 years. A lot of Christmas for me is wrapped up with euphoric recall of incredible moments in the pub with my friends,” said Williams while promoting his new album ‘The Christmas Present’ on <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/ryan-tubridy">Ryan Tubridy’s</a> radio show Friday morning.</p>
      <p>“Then it's a case of 'stop drinking or die' and when you are given that you think 'OK, well I don't want to die, so I better stop drinking',".</p>

      <p>Williams said he struggled to get into the sober Christmas spirit for about “four or five years” before meeting his now-wife, Ayda Field, who, he says, goes “overboard” to celebrate the festive period:“But you can’t help getting into the swing of things with her… and now with the kids, it’s even more special”.</p>
