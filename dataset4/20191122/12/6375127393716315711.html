      <h1>Duterte war on drugs hailed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:31:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/jester-p-manalastas" target="_blank">Jester P. Manalastas</a></address>
      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte’s war on illegal drugs is much more successful than the campaigns of all the previous presidents.</h3>
      <p>This is according to Cavite Rep. Elpidio  Barzaga, Jr., who cited the move of Duterte to release a list of politicians involved in illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>“President Duterte is the first chief executive to expose a list of narco-politicians ranging from congressmen to mayors; and even naming some members of the judiciary, as well as the so-called ninja generals and cops,” Barzaga said.</p>
      <p>“It is a bold and brave move of the President to make such public declaration considering that drug problem is a complicated social problem involving powerful syndicates,” he added.</p>
      <p>During the third quarter of 2019, the President maintained his “very good” satisfaction rating as revealed by the most recent survey of the Social Weather Stations (SWS).</p>
      <p>Based on this survey, 78 percent were satisfied, while 13 percent told SWS that they were dissatisfied, and 9 percent were undecided.</p>
      <p>“This rating is exceptional considering that performance ratings of former presidents typically decline after the first half of their term. The good rating of the President largely reflects the accomplishment of his war on drugs which is the centerpiece of his administration,” Barzaga said.</p>
      <p>According to a poll taken from June 22 to 26 by the SWS, 82 percent of adult Filipinos remain satisfied with the administration’s campaign against illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Reports said that billions of pesos worth of illegal drugs have been confiscated by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) since Duterte took over the presidency.</p>
      <p>Barzaga said the President has started a radical leadership that targets even the hard and seemingly unending problem of illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Barzaga said the notable performance of the President is a litmus test to which all public elected officials are subjected.</p>
