        <figcaption>Wayne Pivac looking forward to getting started with Wales</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s a tricky selection for Wayne Pivac in his first game as Wales coach, with his team hit by countless injuries and unavailabilities.</p>
      <p>The match on November 30 is only a bit of fun, uncapped and against the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>But the new national coach won’t be laughing if his side lose against opponents guided by his Wales predecessor Warren Gatland. It wouldn’t mean a great deal in the grand scheme of things, but coaches have their pride and a good start would create positivity ahead of the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>The indication is that Pivac will go strong with his selection, with an eye to the Six Nations, but circumstances may yet necessitate the odd surprise.</p>
      <p>We look at the team the New Zealander could select...</p>
      <p>
        <b>15. HALLAM AMOS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardiff Blues’ new signing from the Dragons had a strange old World Cup, butchering three tries on the wing against Uruguay and then catching the eye at full-back against New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a punt and suggest Pivac will forget the Uruguay debacle.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Hallam Amos of Wales touches down against New Zealand<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>At the back against the All Blacks, Amos made more runs and metres than Beauden Barrett. He is a classy player who could just develop into something special if he can steer clear of injuries and win the coaches’ faith.</p>
      <p>Leigh Halfpenny? Recovering from concussion. It’s an uncapped game, so why not give him an extra week off?</p>
      <p>
        <b>14. JOHNNY MCNICHOLL</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wales supporters will be looking forward to seeing what the newly qualified McNicholl can do.</p>
      <p>They are unlikely to be disappointed.</p>
      <p>The Scarlet is a 24-carat box-office attraction, a player put on this earth to entertain and score tries.</p>
      <p>He has pace, skill and his first instinct is to attack. Those who have studied him since he arrived in Wales say there’s room to tighten his defence, but there are not many better finishers, whether from full-back or wing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>13. OWEN WATKIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ospreys youngster is likely to be given first crack at laying claim to the jersey temporarily vacated by Jonathan Davies because of injury.</p>
      <p>Of course, Wales could start with Willis Halaholo.</p>
      <p>But such a selection, in a backline with fellow adopted Welshmen Johnny McNicholl and Hadleigh Parkes, would be bold after a week that has seen online chatter about rugby’s residency rule and all its merits and demerits.</p>
      <p>Don’t rule it out, with Pivac fully entitled to say Wales are only playing by the rules and making the most of what’s available to them.</p>
      <p>But perhaps it’s more probable Halaholo will be introduced off the bench.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. HADLEIGH PARKES</b>
      </p>
      <p>He had a challenging World Cup after playing through it with a cracked bone in one of his hands.</p>
      <p>But Pivac knows Parkes’ worth having coached him at the Scarlets.</p>
      <p>If he’s deemed fit, he is likely to start. If not, Watkin could figure at 12 with Halaholo outside him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. JOSH ADAMS</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17183680.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_New-Zealand-v-Wales-Rugby-World-Cup-Bronze-Final.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Josh Adams of Wales celebrates scoring a try against New Zealand<cite>(Image: Ben Evans/Huw Evans Agency)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>His star is high in the sky after a global bash that saw him score seven tries, a Welsh record for a single World Cup edition. Nor was it just about Adams crossing the whitewash.</p>
      <p>He also looked for work and never hid at any point, even in the game against Fiji when he had any number of good reasons to go missing, with Josua Tuisova and Semi Radradra not just in the opposition ranks but in the mood.</p>
      <p>Adams responded with a try-hat-trick.</p>
      <p>He’s hugely reliable and Pivac will want him in his side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. JARROD EVANS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Cardiff Blues’ box of tricks returned to his best form with a high-quality display against the Cheetahs recently. He has variety to his game and a lot of skill and the coach who backs with him will be rewarded.</p>
      <p>The rehabilitation of Sam Davies in a red jersey could see the Dragons man appear off the bench.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. GARETH DAVIES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tomos Williams is very much a player on the up and Aled Davies looked sharp for the Ospreys last weekend, but interception king Davies finished the World Cup significantly in credit and is still ahead of the competition.</p>
      <p>His habit of conjuring tries out of nothing would cheer any coach, and particularly one hoping to start his reign with a win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. WYN JONES</b>
      </p>
      <p>What a notable campaign on the big stage this guy had, with a highlight seeing the Scarlet holding his own against South Africa’s monstrous Frans Malherbe.</p>
      <p>Where had he been before the tournament started? Quietly developing as a player, that’s where.</p>
      <p>There might be a temptation to start with Nicky Smith or Rob Evans, both of whom have been playing of late, but Pivac and Jonathan Humphreys will have noted what Jones did in Japan and he is the man in pole position.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. KEN OWENS</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17154202.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Wales-v-South-Africa-Rugby-World-Cup-Semi-Final.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Ken Owens in trademark action for Wales<cite>(Image: Ben Evans/Huw Evans Agency)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Here’s someone else who had much to be proud of with his efforts in the Far East. He is a leader and a start-up player, one who turns the ignition key on his team’s performances.</p>
      <p>In Alun Wyn Jones’ absence, Pivac is likely to hand the captaincy to either Owens or Justin Tipuric.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. DILLON LEWIS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Cardiff Blues tighthead remains a work in progress as a scrummager, but he carried relentlessly against New Zealand and offers the kind of presence around the field that could come in handy against the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>Samson Lee will hope to play a part as he seeks to re-establish him on the Wales stage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. JAKE BALL</b>
      </p>
      <p>Progress for a team at a World Cup can depend significantly on unsung players stepping forward with their best rugby. Ball was on that beat in Japan, playing as well as he has ever played.</p>
      <p>A call could be made to keep him off the front line after such a physically demanding tournament, but Pivac is looking to use this game as a dry run for the Six Nations, so the likelihood is the bearded one will start.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. ADAM BEARD</b>
      </p>
      <p>Found himself playing catch-up in Japan after missing the start because of appendix surgery. The challenge for Beard now is to kick-on with his game.</p>
      <p>Potentially, he is the future, but Wales will want him to figure prominently in the present, as well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. AARON SHINGLER</b>
      </p>
      <p>As much as any other area, the make-up of the back row will depend on who’s available.</p>
      <p>Shingler seems to have emerged from the past couple of months with his health and fitness intact.</p>
      <p>The Wales coaches know how much he brings, with his lineout expertise and athleticism around the field. The 6ft 6in Scarlet is also back in action for his region this weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. JUSTIN TIPURIC</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17076869.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS195808036.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Justin Tipuric is set to figure against the Baa-Baas</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He hasn’t played since the global tournament but the Ospreys’ man always turns up and Pivac will want to make the most of his experience and quality.</p>
      <p>A game against the Barbarians would be a good stage to parade his talents.</p>

        <b>8. AARON WAINWRIGHT</b>
      </p>
      <p>So much rests on who’s fit and healthy. Ross Moriarty had a gruelling World Cup, featuring in all seven Wales games, and may need further time to recuperate, though he is part of Pivac’s squad.</p>
      <p>And Wainwright injured a hamstring towards the end of the tournament.</p>
      <p>The other option is Taine Basham, an X-factor youngster whose performances early on this season have earned rave reviews.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, Basham is upwardly mobile, but the likelihood is he’ll only start if Moriarty and Wainwright are deemed off limits.</p>
