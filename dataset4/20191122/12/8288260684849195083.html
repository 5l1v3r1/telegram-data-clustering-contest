      <p>This is the dramatic moment a lorry smashed through a level crossing - leading to train delays across the region.</p>
      <p>Shocking footage - <b>which can be viewed above</b> - shows the vehicle taking out the barrier in Station Road, Hartlebury  - seconds before it had fully closed.</p>
      <p>Fire crews from Kidderminster were sent to the scene just before 10am this morning (Friday, November 22) but have since left the incident in the hands of Network Rail.</p>
      <p>No injuries have been reported but the windscreen of the van was damaged as a result of the collision.</p>
      <p>Debris has now been cleared and engineers are currently on site working to reattach the broken barrier.</p>

      <p>Trains are able to run through at a reduced speed until the work has been completed but passengers have been advised to expect delays for the rest of the day, particularly between Kidderminster and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/stourbridge">Stourbridge</a> .</p>
      <p>A fault with the signalling system is also causing travel chaos between Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham Snow Hill.</p>
      <p>Signalling engineers are currently on site working to rectify this issue but National Rail has warned trains may be cancelled, delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.</p>
