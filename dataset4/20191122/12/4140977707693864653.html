          </p>
          <p>Liverpool will face Crystal Palace in the 13th game-week of the Premier League. Liverpool is leading the table with the gap of 8 points against 2nd placed Leicester City.</p>
          <p>The Reds have been phenomenal so far in the league, after 12 games, they are still unbeaten in the league, and consistently grinding results, except for only one draw that was played against Manchester United.</p>

                <p>In the last game-week, Liverpool has further taken lead after they <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/liverpool-3-1-manchester-city-3-talking-points-after-reds-triumph-over-pep-guardiolas-side/">defeated Manchester City by 3-1</a> in a match which was deemed to be one of the most important games in the league.</p>
                <p>For now, Jurgen Klopp’s side doesn’t have any major threat and have the luxury of making mistakes but still, there is a long way to go for the Merseyside club to achieve their dream of winning their maiden Premier League title.</p>

                      <p>On the other hand, Crystal Palace also had a decent start to the season but a string of losses has made them slip to the 12th position in the table with 15 points on the board.</p>
                      <p>Thus, the Eagles do pose a big threat at home but Liverpool’s red hot form would be enough to suppress them. To achieve it Klopp has to field his best playing XI in the squad.</p>

                          <p>However, there are certain challenges to the club as Mohamed Salah is doubtful for the clash with an ankle injury, although he has returned to the training but Klopp will not risk him considering the fixture congestion ahead.</p>

                            <p>Andrew Robertson is also ruled out from the game with an ankle injury and will not be in the touring squad to Selhurst Park. With this, let’s look at the probable lineup of Liverpool Vs Crystal Palace.</p>
