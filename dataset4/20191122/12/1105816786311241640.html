      <p>Following this, it was discovered that the US singer has reportedly started dating Ana Beatriz Boaretto, the mystery woman who looks a lot like Kylie Jenner.</p>
      <p>According to<i> TMZ</i> reports the current relationship status of Tyga and Ana is unclear, the duo met through friends in May and have been getting along ever since. Recently, <i>Daily Mail</i> also reported that Tyga brought Ana along with him abroad to a yacht in St. Barts to celebrate his 30th birthday.</p>
      <p>Tyga and Kylie called it quits back in 2017, the same year that Kylie found a spark with another rapper and the father of one year old daughter Stormi, Travis Scott.</p>
      <p>When Kylie and Travis decided to go their separate ways in early October this year, rumours sparked about Kylie’s reunion with Tyga after the 22 year old was seen outside a recording studio that Tyga was also at.</p>

      <p>However, she later posted on Instagram that she was only dropping off two of her friends at the studio, and did not meet her up with her former love interest.</p>
      <p>The two had first connected five years ago, in 2014, when Tyga showed up at Kylie’s 17th birthday bash. Following this, the rapper and his then girlfriend Blac Chyna split up, although they share a son named King Cairo who is seven-years-old now.</p>
      <p>Blac Chyna went on to date Kylie’s half brother Rob, who she shares three year old Dream Kardashian with.</p>
      <p>However, Kylie has recently sparked rumours of romance with Drake, according to <i>The Sun, </i>adding that that she wanted to keep the alleged spark a secret from her family.</p>
