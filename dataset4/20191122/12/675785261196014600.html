      <h2>Gareth Bale's team mates have made light of the situation that has landed the Welshman in hot water with sections of Real Madrid fans and the media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:15:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Cooper, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/joe-cooper/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> team mate Mariano took a pop at the Welshman's golf game during a training session.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-bale">Bale</a>, who infamously held up a flag stating 'Wales Golf Madrid' after the 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday, caused outrage with fans who question his commitment to his club.</p>
      <p>The famously partisan Spanish media reacted fiercely to the flag, with Marca publishing a front cover blasting Bale.</p>
      <p>Their headline stated "Disrespectful. Wrong. Ungrateful. In that order", while AS went with the headline "Bale digs himself a hole."</p>
      <p>But Bale's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> team mates seem to have taken the issue less seriously, instead opting to poke fun at the Welshman.</p>

      <p>In the video posted online, Bale can be seen training as part of a rondo.</p>
      <p>Mariano is standing next to him in the circle, and when the ball comes to the Spaniard he flicks it to Bale who is taken by surprise and mis-controls it.</p>
      <p>Mariano turns and laughs at Bale, before performing an air golf swing.</p>
      <p>Bale finds the whole thing funny, bursting out into laughter and patting his team mate on the back, who takes his place in the middle of the rondo.</p>
      <p>Bale, for his part, seems unaffected by the furore he has caused in Spain.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media, he said: "I've heard some stories, I don't really take notice.</p>
      <p>"They [fans and media] have their own opinion of me I'm sure, I think it's just one of those things.</p>
      <p>"Whether it's good or bad they just write about me. I must just sell papers, that's the only conclusion I can come to, to be honest."</p>
      <p>The Welshman holds no shame in making it clear that he prefers playing for his country over his club, and finds the ongoing situation funny.</p>
      <p>"I find it hilarious to be honest," he said.</p>
