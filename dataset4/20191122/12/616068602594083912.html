      <p>On the heels of a successful test run this year, organizers of Ultraman Canada have inked a deal to hold the race in Penticton for the next five years.</p>
      <p>The event will serve as the only qualifying race in Canada for the Ultraman World Championships in Hawaii.</p>
      <p>The three-day race is divided into three stages. The first day is a 10-km swim followed by a 145-km bike ride. Day two is a 275-km bike and day three is a 84.4-km double-marathon.</p>
      <p>Ultraman Canada was held in Penticton from 1993-2014 under a previous licensee who later broke away to start their own brand, which later ceased to operate in Penticton. </p>
      <p>Rather than see an end to the event in Penticton, former racers approached the Ultraman brand about a return.</p>
      <p>“Under race director Brad Sawa, the Ultraman Canada 2019 race was held July 26-28 on a conditional basis. Impressed with the success of the race, positive feedback from the competitors, and the team of leaders that Sawa assembled; Jane Bockus and the Ultraman Board of Directors agreed to grant a new five-year Ultraman Canada license running through 2024,” the event said in a news release Friday.</p>
      <p>The Ultraman brand is similar to Ironman in that you must finish an “official” qualifying race in order to have a chance to get to the World Championship in Kona. Next year, Ultraman Canada will take place in Penticton July 24-26. More information can be <a href="https://officialultramancanada.com/">found here.</a></p>
