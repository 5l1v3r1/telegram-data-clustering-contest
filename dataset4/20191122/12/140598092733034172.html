      <p>In the third part of our analysis of Premier League teams and who they might realistically buy in January to meet their season's objectives, we look at teams who should finish in the top seven. Liverpool, Leicester, Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are the focus, featured in order of their current league position.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/breaking-glass-ceiling-mid-table-premier-league-clubs-could/">Part two: Sheffield United, Wolves, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Everton, and West Ham</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/rescue-premier-league-season-areas-struggling-sides-need-strengthen/">Part one: Brighton, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Watford, Southampton, and Norwich</a>.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool</h3>
      <p><b>Current position:</b> 1st</p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target:</b> 1st</p>
      <p><b>New target:</b> 1st</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are ferocious, fantastic to watch and, at the moment, look unbeatable. The season is long though and injuries to key individuals could derail the title bid, specifically if the full-backs, Roberto Firmino, Virgil Van Dijk or Sadio Mane miss out. </p>
      <p>There is cover already but Klopp may look to improve his options if there are any available. A few potential targets, Jadon Sancho one, would be cup-tied in the Champions League and therefore too costly to bring in this January, but anything that helps secure the Premier League might be considered worth it.</p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>Nothing really. A challenger for Roberto Firmino’s place in the first team might help. </p>
      <h4>Who they could buy </h4>
      <p>
        <b>Timo Werner (RB Leipzig)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000216468702_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7DrmQl2cFTxOfaUZ8CHMGSc.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Credit: BONGARTS</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Has been linked with Liverpool for some time now. A German forward who loves to press from the front, Werner is 23-years-old and has 11 goals and four assists in 11 Bundesliga games this season. Would provide excellent cover for Firmino and a different option when Klopp would prefer a traditional nine up top. Champions League cup-tied and would cost upwards of £40million.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Erling Haaland (RB Salzburg)</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/24/footballs-next-superstar-teenage-scoring-sensation-erling-haaland/">One of the most exciting young players in world football</a>, Haaland can basically pick where he wants to go and should do so carefully. He isn’t guaranteed first team football at Liverpool and that must be the priority at present, but who’s to say one of Klopp’s current front three doesn’t depart in the summer to Barcelona or Real Madrid? By securing Haaland’s signature in January with a view to moving in the summer, Liverpool would guarantee a brilliant goalscorer for next season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>John McGinn (Aston Villa)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Has been outstanding for Aston Villa and Scotland this season, running from box to box, scoring goals, winning tackles and making things happen. Would suit Liverpool’s midfield perfectly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ben White (Brighton - on loan at Leeds)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Young ball-playing defender who has impressed in the Championship this season under Marcelo Bielsa’s coaching. Linked with a move to Liverpool but probably not until the summer if it were to happen.</p>
      <h3>Leicester</h3>
      <p><b>Current position:</b> 2nd</p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target:</b> European qualification</p>
      <p><b>New target:</b> Champions League qualification</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has done a brilliant job since taking over at Leicester but their early season success is not all down to managerial genius - the players are excellent. The team is superbly balanced and the only things missing are better cover or options to rival those in the first XI.</p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>Improvements that are affordable and won’t upset the balance of the team</p>
      <h4>Who they could realistically buy</h4>
      <p>Players on the cusp of greatness but not yet at their peak. Think Youri Tielemans. Former wonderkids yet to make the move to a big/rich club.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dani Olmo (Dinamo Zagreb)</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 21-year-old Spain Under-21 international currently playing in Croatia, Olmo can play anywhere behind the striker and would provide competition for Harvey Barnes and Ayoze Perez on either side. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Isak (Real Sociedad)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Isak scored 13 goals in 16 Eredivisie appearances last season at Willem II before moving to Spain where he is slowly breaking into the first team at Real Sociedad. One for the future but that suits Leicester’s strategy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mariano (Real Madrid)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000172964990_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwSvt64SOwQdSQRCkYLG9BYQ.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Credit: REUTERS</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A striker who just isn’t going to make it at Real Madrid, Mariano is 26-years-old, fairly quick (not quite Jamie Vardy levels but he’s fast) and works hard off the ball. Is also decent at scoring with his head and might relish the chance to prove himself at a non-top tier club.</p>
      <h3>Man City</h3>
      <p><b>Current position:</b> 4th    </p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target</b>: 1st</p>
      <p><b>New target</b>: 1st</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s City have faltered this season, suffering unexpected defeats and losing ground on their title rivals, but there are still 26 games to go and anything can happen. What certainly could do with transpiring is the acquisition of at least one centre-back who fits the Guardiola mould, and possibly a tricky winger who can replace Leroy Sane when/if he departs for Bayern Munich as has been rumoured.</p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>A new centre-back. Or two.</p>
      <h4>Who they could realistically buy</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Dayot Upamecano (RB Leipzig)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213915852_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqndcdFLHi7bsSLPt6vqTyW7DUWEGhID_RKPmCm-Qzv8s.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Credit: AFP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A 20-year-old French centre-back, Upamecano is one of the most highly rated young defenders in Europe and one expected to make a move to one of the continent’s giants soon. Is Champions League cup-tied but his bravery, rapid pace for recovery runs and ability to play out from the back would suit City’s style of play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Milan Skrinier (Inter Milan)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Skrinier would cost an enormous amount of money (potentially more than Harry Maguire) and is likely to move to La Liga soon according to his agent, but is another ball-playing centre-back who would bring some strength and height to the back line. At 6ft 2’, City would have a player who commands the box at set-pieces.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Caglar Soyuncu (Leicester)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Has impressed since stepping into Harry Maguire’s shoes and looks capable of moving up another level. Leicester are a team going places but the call of Guardiola and City, if they are willing to pay the money to sign him, could prove too big an opportunity to turn down.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Inigo Martinez (Athletic Bilbao)</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 28-year-old Spanish - you guessed it - ball-playing defender. Superb off the ball but perhaps not the best in the air. </p>
      <h3>Manchester United</h3>
      <p><b>Current position:</b> 7th</p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target</b>: Top four</p>
      <p><b>New target:</b> European qualification</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has admitted he left himself short of options upfront when getting rid of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez and will surely look to invest in a goalscorer in the January window. More important is addressing the midfield which is one of the weakest in the top half of the table, even when Paul Pogba is fit to play. </p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>A deep-lying playmaker, a box-to-box midfielder, a defensive midfielder, a striker.</p>
      <h4>Who they could realistically buy</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Erling Haaland (RB Salzburg)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000215263340_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqGw_8_YqFn6oOhW46YSWnyhZ2jGtXV0jiKnj6kMwpMY.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>

      </figure>
      <p>United should be moving heaven, the earth and the multiverse to sign Haaland. Powerful, rapid, cunning and always turned up to 11, Haaland would instantly improve United’s attack and would score bags of goals. Bags.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mario Mandzukic (Juventus)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford, Mandzukic would represent a move away from the strategy of buying young and building a team but brings experience, drive and bite. At 33-years-old he shouldn’t cost too much.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ruben Neves (Wolves)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deep-lying playmaker United need. Classy, strong in the tackle, capable of pinging top corner shots from distance and a natural leader, Neves would cost something crazy like £70-80million but would be a top United player for years to come.</p>
      <p>
        <b>John McGinn (Aston Villa)</b>
      </p>
      <p>McGinn would bring energy, enthusiasm and high workrate to the centre of the pitch. Makes late runs to support attacks, always busy in midfield, and at 25 a great age to make the next step in a career rapidly ascending.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Would Ndidi leave a team challenging for the top four, one capable of doing something special this season, to join a struggling Manchester United? Solskjaer should definitely find out because £50-60million might be enough to secure the league’s best defensive midfielder. Ndidi and Scott McTominay behind Paul Pogba is a balanced, talented unit. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wilson is at peak age for a striker (27) and doing the best he can in a limited Bournemouth side. Scored 14 goals in 30 Premier League games last season and has everything a United striker should: good off-the-ball movement, pace, strength, can dribble and finishes the few chances he gets. With better service Wilson could be a 20 goal a season striker but would cost a tidy penny.</p>
      <h3>Chelsea</h3>
      <p><b>Current position</b>: 3rd</p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target</b>: Top four</p>
      <p><b>New target:</b> Top four</p>
      <p>Chelsea can’t actually sign anyone unless things go their way in court in December but Frank Lampard has done so well at integrating youth academy products into the first team it’s difficult to see where he could really improve them at the moment.</p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>Maybe a left-back? Both Emerson and Marcos Alonso are far better going forward than staying back but there aren’t many left-backs around who would represent a sensible investment. </p>
      <h4>Who they could realistically buy</h4>
      <p>At the moment they aren't allowed to register any players. But if they were...</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ben Chilwell (Leicester)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000216510792_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Ben Chilwell has developed into England's first choice left back Credit: AFP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Would cost a gigantic fee and Leicester have absolutely no need to sell. Chelsea are the bigger club, or more consistently successful, but both teams are competing for third place and the transfer fee involved makes this highly unlikely. Stranger things have happened.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal</h3>
      <p><b>Current position:</b> 6th</p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target:</b> Top four</p>
      <p><b>New target</b>: Top four</p>
      <p>Unai Emery is under pressure from the fans but has backing from the board. How long that continues will depend on whether he figures out what his definite best XI. Emery wants to play one striker but has two, is trying to integrate several youngsters (some of which just aren't quite ready yet) into the side as part of a long-term plan and has defenders who regularly let him down. The Granit Xhaka escapade was embarrassing for all. There won’t be much, if any, money left for the January window.</p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>To figure out a first XI and have everyone fit. A holding midfield player and leaders in the centre of the pitch who are tactically disciplined.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emre Can (Juventus)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nowhere close to the Juventus first team, Can could operate as Xhaka’s replacement at the base of Emery’s midfield. As seen during his time at Liverpool, he’s a neat passer of the ball who gets stuck in.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum McGregor (Celtic)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000216728509_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Credit: UEFA</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Has just signed a new deal at Celtic but would slot it into a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 nicely, providing defensive cover and keeping things tidy. Suits Arsenal’s traditional passing ways.</p>
      <h3>Tottenham</h3>
      <p><b>Current position:</b> 14th</p>
      <p><b>Pre-season target:</b> 3rd</p>
      <p><b>New target:</b> Top four</p>
      <p>Spurs are due a new manager bounce and in Jose Mourinho, should gain a lot of height swiftly. The worry is that in the third season the team will eventually plummet back to earth but for now, Tottenham really could be onto something special. Mourinho says he doesn’t need to buy anyone in January but if results don’t go his way expect that to change - Daniel Levy found money to sack and hire a new coaching staff, so there must be a bit of cash lying around.</p>
      <h4>What they need</h4>
      <p>A right-back. A striker who can challenge Harry Kane for a starting position but won't expect to start every week. </p>
      <h4>Who they could realistically sign</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Max Aarons (Norwich)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kyle Walker-Peters has been given chances but at 22-years-old still hasn’t taken them and Mourinho might not enjoy Serge Aurier’s tendency to do strange things on the pitch. Aarons is only 19 and on his way to becoming yet another top English right-back, having started 10 games in the Premier League this season. Norwich are in real danger of going down and if offered a big fee may have little choice but to let him go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Youcef Atal (Nice)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Algerian right wing-back who can play as a forward. Wanted by a few European clubs after some impressive performances in Ligue 1 over the past season and a half, and shouldn’t cost anything too scary. £20million might get the deal done.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free transfer)</b>
      </p>
      <p>As reported in Telegraph Sport on Thursday, Ibrahimovic could join his old boss at Spurs when his deal ends at LA Galaxy in the new year. The towering Swede is 38 years old now but you’d never know it from some of the stunning goals he has scored in America since joining.</p>
