      <h1>Xherdan Shaqiri ready for "very, very important" Liverpool role, says Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <h2>The Swiss has only featured for 16 minutes this season, but is in line for a return to the squad at Crystal Palace this weekend if he can prove his fitness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:46:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp insists Xherdan Shaqiri has a future at Anfield, despite talks over his lack of action.</p>
      <p>The Swiss international is finally back from a six-week injury, amid swirling speculation that he wants out of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> given his spell in the wilderness before he was crocked.</p>
      <p>The winger has played just 16 minutes in the Premier League all season, and three minutes in a Champions League lost cause at Napoli.</p>
      <p>Inevitably, that has led to reports suggesting he will consider his future, but Klopp made clear that he will still have a big role to play as the Reds push for the title this season.</p>

      <p>The manager explained he sat down with the player to discuss the lack of opportunity before his injury: “We spoke earlier (in the season) he wasn't playing as much as he wanted to.</p>
      <p>“But why should I talk about something that's outside? Speculation is speculation. Completely fine here. Of course he has a future here - this season he's a very, very important player for us."</p>
      <p>Klopp in fact, believes that the Switzerland international can return to first team action when his intensity returns after training solidly for a few weeks.</p>

      <p>And he said he’s not looking beyond this season.</p>
      <p>“We are in this season, and for this season Shaqiri is an important player. When I'm with him he's completely happy. It's about getting the intensity back,” he added.</p>
      <p>“The most intense period is coming up now and hopefully more people will be ready for that, you will see him on the pitch 100 per cent. He needs to get match fitness again.</p>

      <p>“He trained this week, we gave him some different things to do. He needs to get used to the intensity again. Apart from that he should be completely fine.”</p>
      <p>Joel Matip is still sidelined with a knee problem, but Klopp explained that both Mo Salah and Andy Robertson have a chance of playing at Palace, with both due to train fully on Friday, before the visit to London.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk will also play after missing Holland’s last game.</p>
