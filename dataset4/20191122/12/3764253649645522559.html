        <b>Sandra Iheuwa, the alleged 4th babymama of Nigerian businessman, Ubi Franklin, appears to have taken another swipe at him following the news of birth control for men getting approved.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is no news that the relationship between Sandra and Ubi has been estranged ever since the scandal surrounding him getting a loan from her and allegedly putting her in the family way, broke out.</p>
      <p>Well, it comes as no surprise that she recently threw some shade at him. Reacting to reports that male birth control injections have passed clinical trials and will soon be available for men, she took to her Instagram page to send across a not-so-subliminal message to who many people believe is him.</p>
      <p>Sharing the post, she wrote:<i>"Yay!!! A lot of you men need this don't come and say how did you get pregnant? Or start denying pregnancies .....if you don't want that babe to get belle go on birth control......the burden will no longer be on the woman. I love th</i>is "</p>
