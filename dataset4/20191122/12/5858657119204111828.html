      <p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The 27-year-old mother of a missing 5-year-old girl has been released from the hospital and taken to jail on charges of child neglect and giving false information to law enforcement.</p>
      <p>Jacksonville Sheriff’s officials said Brianna Williams tried to kill herself after remains believed to be Taylor Williams were found Nov. 12 near Demopolis, Alabama.</p>
      <p>Williams reported her daughter missing Nov. 6. She stopped co-operating with authorities after they found inconsistencies in her story. Williams is a petty officer at Naval Air Station Jacksonville.</p>
      <p>Arrest documents show a neighbour often saw the child alone at their apartment complex. Records show she last attended day care April 29.</p>
      <p>The remains found haven’t been positively identified.</p>
      <p>The Florida Times-Union reports the child’s grandparents say they last saw her a year ago.</p>
      <p>A lawyer isn’t listed on jail records.</p>
