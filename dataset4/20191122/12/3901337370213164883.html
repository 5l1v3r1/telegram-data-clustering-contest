      <p>Earlier this year, it was reported that Brazilian legend Ronaldinho was facing some financial trouble. However, his recent purchase of a R3.6 million Aston Martin could well suggest otherwise. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Â In July, reports in Brazilian media suggested that the ex-Barcelona trickster was stopped in his tracks while trying to sell some of his real estate in an attempt to pay unpaid environmental fines on alleged illegal construction at one of his lake houses in Porto Alegre.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Ronaldinho recently took to Instagram to showcase his new ride, which he seemingly purchased while spending time in Saudi Arabia.</p>

      <p>With money issues seemingly being the least of his worries, the former AC Milan star showed off what is known as an Aston Martin Rapide AMR, with <i>Arabnews.com</i> reporting that Ronaldinho bought the car at a car show called the 2019 Riyadh Motor Show.</p>
      <p>The fire-breathing V12 sports car can reach speeds of 100km/h in four seconds, and is priced around the R3.6 million mark.</p>
