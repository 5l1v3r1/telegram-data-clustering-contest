      <p>Last February Knockavilla Donaskeigh Kickhams  Camogie club invited the hurling club to join them in a joint venture which would be appropriately named Strictly Black and Amber.</p>
      <p>The night was to be a fundraiser for both clubs, to enable development of facilities, enhancing coaching and training capabilities. </p>
      <p>But the essences of this venture was to be greater  then purely fundraising, it was indeed to be a community night, reaching to every corner of the parish and stimulating interests from all age groups.</p>
      <p>Proudly supported by  two main sponsors Dew Valley  and O'Dwyer Steel, the committees attentively set the seeds of organisation and the 30 dancers under the watchful eyes of choreographer Lauren McGuire perfected their dance routines.</p>
      <p>Credit goes to the many businesses and personal sponsorship that were generously donated to support this exciting venture.</p>
      <p> Halla na Feile in Cashel saw capacity attendance for a night that was full of fun, laughter and toe tapping  dance routines where the feeling of community was palpable.</p>
