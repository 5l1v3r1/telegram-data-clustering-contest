      <h1>Leganés vs Barcelona: Expected Starting XI for post-break league match</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona will look to continue their good league form against Leganés</h3>
      <p>While the Champions League campaign has been topsy-turvy so far, the La Liga title looks ever more poised for retention. Barcelona have scored 19 goals in the last 5 games, and will be looking to retain the lead at the top of the league table against Leganés.</p>
      <p>But Ernesto Valverde’s squad will be depleted for the trip to Madrid. Sergi Roberto is suspended, while Nélson Semedo is out for three more weeks. There are doubts regarding the fitness of Jordi Alba and Ivan Rakitić.</p>
      <h4>Expected Starting XI (4-3-3):</h4>
      <p><b>Goalkeeper</b>: Marc-André ter Stegen<br/><b>Right-back</b>: Moussa Wagué<br/><b>Centre-back(right)</b>: Gerard Piqué<br/><b>Centre-back(left)</b>: Clément Lenglet<br/><b>Left-back</b>: Junior Firpo<br/><b>Central playmaker(right)</b>: Frenkie de Jong<br/><b>Holding midfielder</b>: Sergio Busquets<br/><b>Central playmaker(left)</b>: Arthur<br/><b>Right winger</b>: Lionel Messi<br/><b>Centre-forward</b>: Luis Suárez<br/><b>Left winger</b>: Ousmane Dembélé</p>
      <p>After a relatively less frustrating international period with Germany, Marc-André ter Stegen will return to club action fully match-fit. At right-back, the absence of both Nélson Semedo and Sergi Roberto will result in Moussa Wagué making his first appearance of the season.</p>
      <p>Gerard Piqué and Clément Lenglet will be the main men at the back, with Valverde unlikely to risk yet another injury for Samuel Umtiti. Due to the doubts regarding Jordi Alba’s fitness, Junior Firpo could get another run-out after impressing against Celta Vigo.</p>
      <p>In midfield, Sergio Busquets will be keeping his place after returning to form recently. Frenkie de Jong will keep getting minutes, as the young Dutchman continues to evolve into a superstar. Arthur will also keep his place, after returning from rest against Celta.</p>
      <p>Up front, Lionel Messi will lead the line after a very successful international period with Argentina. He will partner Luis Suárez. But the third place in attack is still very much up for grabs, with Antoine Griezmann, Ansu Fati and Ousmane Dembélé all staking a claim.</p>
      <p>But considering the fact that Dembélé has enjoyed the least playing time among all three, he could get the nod. Overall, a strong side will be fielded. History is on Barça’s side, with previous results pointing in the right direction for Valverde’s men.</p>
