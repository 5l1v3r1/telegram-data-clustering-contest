      <h1>Jose Mourinho wants Adrien Rabiot at Tottenham Hotspur?</h1>
      <h2>New <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> is reportedly eyeing a move for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adrien-rabiot/"><b>Adrien Rabiot</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 24-year-old joined Juve on a free transfer over the summer after running down his contract with Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>The Old Lady are believed to have beaten a number of English clubs - including Tottenham - to the signature of the Frenchman on a contract until the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>Rabiot has struggled to earn a starting role for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/maurizio-sarri/"><b>Maurizio Sarri</b></a>'s side this season, though, and has completed the 90 minutes in just one of their 12 league matches to date.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Calciomercato</i>, Mourinho is an admirer of the midfielder, and the new Spurs manager wants his club to make a move in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Rabiot is yet to score or provide an assist in nine outings for Juve this season.</p>
