      <p>Nyaba, only 3 market days have passed in this new moon, but already events in our chiefdom make it look as though it has been 3 millennia and 2 centuries since November started.</p>
      <p>Our elders say, when a man prays to his God in another man’s language, theirs is the possibility that his problem is not big enough. On the contrary, our problems as a chiefdom are so many and so diverse, yet when we pray, it appears we choose to do so in different languages. Have you heard of the National Cathedral? Well….. I might as well tell you that once that is done with, our chiefdom will also be blessed with a national shrine.</p>
      <p>Nyaba, don’t ask me how that shrine will be built, or who will operate it. Don’t ask me which gods will occupy that shrine for I do not have the answer. Our people say, a naked man does not dip his hands in his pockets. I am naked, therefore let me not attempt to dip my hands in my pocket. I don’t want trouble. Afterall, what concerns a dog with family planning?</p>
      <p>Nyaba, do you know why the people we call mad, usually walk around with so many items? It is because, whatever they see, they say to themselves, “this one is good, that one too is good” and before long they have plenty of absolutely useless loads to carry. That is what we are about to do in our chiefdom. We have been running a certain system at the district assembly level for some time now. Yes, there are problems with it. But yes, there are problems with our political parties too. But no, we decide that instead of looking for a more viable solution, what we deem fit to help us the most is to replace one problem with an even bigger problem. That is how I see the proposal to introduce partisan politics at the district level.</p>
      <p>You see, by naming your son after the Biblical Samson does not mean that he will become as strong as Samson. Samson has been strong in his fight for a “No” vote. I am with him. I will also vote “no”.</p>
      <p>Nyaba, too much talking and over confidence is what denied February from being complete. One of the deputy Chairpersons at the national thumb printing counters office has been talking too much. I pray he doesn’t end up like February. How can a referee in a game of football declare the team his supports and wishes to win? That is how the deputy chairperson at the office of the national thumb print counters has done. Does he still qualify to count our thumb prints?</p>
      <p>At this point, he can’t really be trusted. What is trust by the way? If there was anything such as trust, would water ever agree to boil fish? Haven’t water and fish been neighbors for years? Dr Bossman has not spoken like a boss man at all. What he forgets is that he is a referee. Referees should not play football even if they wanted to.</p>
      <p>Nyaba, let somebody who knows somebody who knows Dr Bossman tell him that regardless of how many times the lizard does press-ups, it can never develop the muscles of a crocodile.</p>
      <p>Tell our people that if there’s something we can do today, let’s not leave it till tomorrow. The fowl kept telling the other birds “I will do it later” and that was how it failed to fly.</p>
      <p>Nyaba, I won’t talk too much but let me remind you that “feel at home, feel at home” that was how a visitor spoiled my remote.</p>
