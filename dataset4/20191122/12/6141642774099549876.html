      <p>Nigel Farage has called for a cap on immigration, a 50% cut in the foreign aid budget and the scrapping of HS2 as he set out the Brexit Party’s policy platform for the General Election.</p>
      <p>Launching the party’s “contract with the people”, Mr Farage said all the party’s demands were underpinned by the need to secure a “clean-break Brexit” with the EU.</p>
      <p>While he acknowledged they were not seeking election as the next government, he said they were committing to achieving the Brexit which people voted for in the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>“A clean-break Brexit can shape the future of our economy and society,” he said.</p>

      <p>The policy document calls for:</p>
      <p>– Scrapping the BBC licence fee</p>
      <p>– Allowing citizens to call referendums if five million people agree</p>
      <p>– Abolishing inheritance tax</p>
      <p>– Investing £2.5 billion in fishing and coastal communities</p>
      <p>– Giving businesses zero-rate corporation tax for the first £10,000 of pre-tax profits</p>
      <p>– Abolishing privatisation in the NHS</p>
      <p>– Establishing 24-hour GP surgeries</p>
      <p>While the Brexit Party is not standing candidates in Conservative-held constituencies, Mr Farage said it was important they took seats to ensure the Tories did not backtrack on their commitments.</p>
      <p>“We need the Brexit Party to hold Boris Johnson to his word,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We need the Brexit Party voice there in the House of Commons or we’re not going to get anything like what we voted for three-and-a-half years ago.”</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said their plans could be paid for by £200 billion of savings by cutting the foreign aid budget, ceasing EU payments and scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail link.</p>
      <p>On immigration, he said the UK was facing a “population crisis” as a result of the policies which had been adopted in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>He said the numbers allowed to settle in the country should be capped at “about 50,000” a year and he called for firm action to deter illegal immigrants trying to enter the country.</p>
      <p>“We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We think a strong message that says if you come here illegally across the Channel or in the back of a container that you wouldn’t be allowed to stay will prevent further human tragedy, and it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
