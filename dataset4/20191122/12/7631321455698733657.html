      <p>The company aims to be the largest hardware retail chain in Vietnam with 20-40 outlets within the next 10 years, a representative of the company said.</p>
      <p>The company enters Vietnam as rising urban incomes see increasing demand for furniture and household items, the representative added.</p>
      <p>Before Vietnam, Ace Hardware entered several other Asian markets like Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea.</p>
      <p>The Illinois-based company, established in 1931, has over 5,200 outlets in almost 70 markets.</p>
      <p>According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, on average, 1-3 retail stores are needed per 1,000 people. However, only 7,012 stores are considered modern retail stores in Vietnam. </p>
      <p>The country’s revenue from selling goods last year rose by 11.7 percent from 2017 to $142 billion, up 12.4 percent from 2017.</p>
