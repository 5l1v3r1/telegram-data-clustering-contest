      <h3>Knives Out</h3>
      <h4>Knives out release date: 27 November 2019 (US), 29 November 2019 (UK)</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Chris Evans, Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis</p>
      <p><b>What we know:</b> Murder mysteries are always a fun ride, but Knives Out will put a modern and bizarre twist on the whodunnit genre. From The Last Jedi's Rhian Johnson, this mystery-comedy hybrid follows Benoit Blanc as he investigated the death of wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey. Early reviews are glowing, so we can't wait.</p>

      <h3>Charlie’s Angels</h3>
      <h4>Charlie’s Angels release date: 29 November 2019 </h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinska</p>
      <p><b>What we know:</b> The original Charlie’s Angels was all about bums, bikinis and boys that they dated - but not this reboot. Instead, all we’re getting is three kickass spies who work for THREE Bosleys (played by Sir Patrick Stewart, Elizabeth Banks and Djimon Hounsou).</p>

      <h3>Jumanji: The Next Level</h3>
      <h4>Jumanji: The Next Level release date: 13 December 2019</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, Kevin Hart</p>
      <p><b>What we know:</b> After reimagining the Robin Williams classic, this video game adventure will move away from the jungle environment, and instead take the characters to far flung places, including baron deserts and snowy mountains. But one thing is for certain; the dangerous game will continue on.</p>

      <h3>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</h3>
      <h4>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker release date: 19 December 2019</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver</p>
      <p><b>What we know:</b> The Last Jedi completely divided audiences down the middle, so we’re eager to see how the last film in this Star War phase will be received. Once again, this is another Disney film shrouded in mystery, but we do know that Emperor Palpatine will be returning in some form.</p>

      <h3>Cats</h3>
      <h4>Cats release date: 20 December 2019</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba</p>
      <p>What we know: It looks freaky, that’s for sure. On paper, this film should be amazing. The cast is almost exclusively A-list, the directors are renowned, and of course the show is one of the staples of West End and Broadway, telling the story of the Jellicles who try decide which feline should be reborn. But seriously, what were they THINKING with this animation?!</p>

      <h3>Little Women </h3>
      <h4>Little Women release date: 25 December 2019 (US), 27 December 2019</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen</p>
      <p>What we know: The year wouldn't be complete without a classic period drama adaptation. Exploring the lives of the March sisters after the American Civil War, this film will not follow the classic narrative structure, instead focusing on themes and jumping back and forth between the characters. </p>

      <h3>Biggest films of 2020</h3>
      <p>Post New Year, we have some HUGE films on the horizon, and it would be rude to not include them in our list. So here are some of the biggest movies of 2020: </p>
      <h3>1917</h3>
      <h4>1917 release date: 17 January 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Mark Strong</p>
      <p>What we know: Director and writer of the film Sam Mendes actually conceived this screenplay from an account of his grandfather, novelist Alfred Mendes. Set during WW1 in Northern France, a pair of British soldiers are sent on a seemingly impossible mission to deliver a message to warn of an ambush from the enemy side.</p>

      <h3>Bad Boys For Life</h3>
      <h4>Bad Boys For Life release date: 17 January 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens</p>
      <p>What we know: Bad Boys, watcha gunna do? Release a third film in the series apparently. Bad Boys For Life follows the (now) police inspector Marcus Burnett and his former partner Mike Lowrey - whose in the middle of a midlife crisis - as they reunite once again to take on a Romanian mob boss. </p>

      <h3>Dolittle</h3>
      <h4>Dolittle release date: 7 February 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Michael Sheen </p>
      <p>What we know: We all know the story of Doctor Dolittle - the physician who can talk to animals. However, this movie will be different from previous iterations, as it's based on The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle as opposed to the original book. But honestly, most people are excited that we get to see Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland in a movie together again (still crying, not gonna lie). </p>

      <h3>Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</h3>
      <h4>Birds of Prey release date: 7 February 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead</p>
      <p>What we know: If you can forget about the train wreck that was Suicide Squad for a second, this film may have some potential. Former villain Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) teams up with three DC icons - Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya - to protect a girl who has gotten in over her head. </p>

      <h3>The King's Man</h3>
      <h4>The King's Man release date: 14 February 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Rhys Ifans </p>
      <p>What we know: What better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than with a fast-paced action movie about a bunch of British guys who fight crime in tailored suits? The King's Man is actually the third film in the Kingsman series, but this time it's an origin story about how the spies came to be - which means a brand new cast. </p>

      <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
      <h4>Sonic the Hedgehog release date: 14 February 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Ben Schwartz, Jim Carrey, James Marsden</p>
      <p>What we know: This film was delayed because fans were so angry (and rightly so) with the original state of this blue hedgehog, so the poor animators had to redo everything. However, they've done a great job, as Sonic looks MUCH better now. The real question is was all this work worth it if the plot isn't up to scratch? Video game movies are notoriously bad. But hey, gotta go fast, right?</p>

      <h3>Onward</h3>
      <h4>Onward release date: March 6 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Octavia Spencer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus</p>
      <p>What we know: The latest Pixar hit has poached one big Marvel star, Chris Pratt, and one ex-Marvel star, Tom Holland (we're still in tears). Onward follows two teen elf brothers who go on a quest to discover if there's any magic left in the world. It'll probably do a classic Pixar-move and be 50% light-hearted fun, and 50% hitting you right in the feels. </p>

      <h3>No Time to Die</h3>
      <h4>No Time to Die release date: 3 April 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Rami Malek</p>
      <p>What we know: We've all been waiting for Bond 25 since Spectre, which was a whopping five years ago. Bond has left the service and has retired to Jamaica, but is dragged back into action when an old friend shows up asking for help. Craig's films tend to go up and down, but as this is his last film we're hoping that it will finish his run on a high. </p>

      <h3>Black Widow</h3>
      <h4>Black Widow release date: 1 May 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Scarlett Johansson, Rachel Weisz, Florence Pugh, David Harbour</p>
      <p>What we know: Black Widow is the first standalone film for avenger Natasha Romonov. Set between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, Black Widow is on the run for not obeying the Sokovia Accords and assisting Steve Rogers, whilst dealing with a ghost from her past - Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian (played by David Harbour). </p>

      <h3>Mulan 2020</h3>
      <h4>Mulan 2020 release date: 27 March 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring:</b> Liu Yifei, Donnie Yen, Jason Scott Lee</p>
      <p>What we know: Though it's the latest in the long list of Disney live action remakes, Mulan may end up being the most different to the original cartoon. There will be NO singing (moment of silence for 'Let's get down to business') and no Mushu - so this is going to be more of a dramatic interpretation of a Disney classic. Colour us intrigued. </p>

      <h3>Wonder Woman 1984</h3>
      <h4>Wonder Woman 1984 release date: 5 June 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig, Pedro Pascal</p>
      <p>What we know: Wonder Woman shook up the DC Universe when it first came out, so it's safe to say that everyone is quaking at the thought of Patty Jenkins's follow up film. We don't know all the details yet - but Diana Prince will be fighting the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and Kristen Wiig will be playing the nemesis of the film, Cheeta. </p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Soul</h3>
      <h4>Soul release date: 19 June 2020</h4>
      <p><b>Starring: </b>Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Questlove, Phylicia Rashad, Daveed Diggs</p>
      <p>What we know: This one is giving us big Inside Out vibes, and it's no wonder considering that it's from the same director. Music teacher Joe Gardener dreams of being on the stage, but just as his dreams are coming true, his soul is separated from his body. There, he works with other souls to train them up in order to return to Earth. It's a bit bonkers, but looks like it could be a tearjerker. </p>
