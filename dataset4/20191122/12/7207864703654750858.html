      <h1>China's Mysterious Stealth JH-XX Bomber: A Threat to the U.S. Military?</h1>
      <h2>Here is everything we know about it. </h2>

      <p>The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is developing not one, but two stealth bombers, according to a Defense Intelligence Agency <a href="https://www.dia.mil/News/Articles/Article-View/Article/1732500/defense-intelligence-agency-releases-report-on-china-military-power/">report</a> published earlier this year. A steady stream of details has emerged concerning one of them-- the <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-h-20-stealth-bomber-biggest-threat-us-military-97542">H-20</a> is a long-distance flying wing stealth bomber, with a robust electronic countermeasures (ECM) package and sensor fusion integration. Nevertheless, Chinese defense sources remain tight-lipped concerning the PLAAF’s second project.</p>
      <p>Here is everything we know about the PLAAF’s mysterious JH-XX bomber.</p>
      <p>Described by the DIA report as a “fighter-bomber,”  the JH-XX is the tactical counterpart to the H-20 strategic bomber. It is widely speculated that the JH-XX is the early concept bomber depicted on the May 2018 cover of the prolific Chinese defense magazine “Aerospace Knowledge,” brought to the attention of western audiences by <a href="http://china-defense.blogspot.com/2018/04/here-it-is-first-artists-impression-of.html">China Defense Blog</a>. If true, these early images depict a conventionally designed, supermaneuverable, supersonic bomber with an internal weapons bay. Several aspects of the JH-XX’s design, including the jagged air intakes and the way the twin-engine nozzles are embedded in the tail, suggesting a decent measure engineering attention paid to stealth performance.</p>
      <p>But whereas stealth is a top design priority for the H-20, the JH-XX seeks to balance low-detectability features against speed and limited dogfighting abilities; to that end, the JH-XX will carry anti-air missiles. The  <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/out-range-why-chinas-j-20-might-have-tools-kill-f-35-63377">PL-15</a>, a Chinese long-range anti-air missile with a host of best-in-class features, is an ideal candidate for this type of aircraft. The JH-XX will also likely boast a more modest combat radius of around of up to 2,000 kilometers, as opposed to the H-20’s 5,000 km, and is almost certainly not in the same weight or payload class as the H-20.</p>
      <p>A rough portrait emerges of the JH-XX as a supersonic regional bomber that doubles as a stealthy, long-distance interceptor. With its blend of anti-ship and anti-air capabilities, China’s latest fighter seems even more tailor-made than the H-20 for countering American Carrier Battle Groups. The JH-XX thus plays a clear role in China’s Pacific strategy: namely, it strengthens Beijing’s grip over the<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ultimate-way-deter-china-why-island-chain-defense-can-work-61942"> first island chain</a> off China’s east coast and poses a credible deterrent to any outside force seeking to intervene in a prospective Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Together with the H-20, the JH-XX could also be the latest milestone in China’s long-term goal of contesting the second island chain by threatening the US base on the island of Guam.</p>
      <p>It bears noting that China’s two next-generation fighters appear to be separated by years of R&amp;D work. The H-20 is on the verge of being formally announced and is planned to enter service in the PLAAF by the mid-2020s. Meanwhile, the JH-XX may not even be in active development; the fighter shown in “Aerospace Knowledge” may turn out to be nothing more than an early concept. As formidable as it appears in filling what is a niche, but vital role that blurs the line between strategic and tactical roles, there is currently no assurance that the JH-XX-- or something like it--  is coming anytime soon.</p>
