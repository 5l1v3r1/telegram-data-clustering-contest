      <p><b>NATO</b> Secretary General <b>Jens Stoltenberg</b> said in an interview with French daily Figaro that <b>Turkey</b> is a very important country for the alliance.</p>
      <p>"All allies criticized Operation Peace Spring, but no one spoke of <b>Turkey</b>'s place in NATO. <b>Turkey</b> has allowed its allies to use its bases while fighting the Islamic State.</p>
      <p><b>Turkey</b> is the only <b>NATO</b> country on the border with Syria and Iraq. It welcomed 3.6 million refugees. <b>Turkey</b> is very important to NATO. To find out, it's enough to look at the map and look at <b>Turkey</b>'s geostrategic position," Stoltenberg noted.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the recent statement by French President <b>Emmanuel Macron</b> that "<b>NATO</b> is suffering brain death", he said that "<b>NATO</b> is vital for security issues".</p>
      <p>Stoltenberg saidÂ  that the best way to address any differences "is to sit down and discuss them and to fully understand the messages and the motivations."</p>
      <p>"My message is that <b>NATO</b> is adapting, <b>NATO</b> is agile, <b>NATO</b> is responding," he told reporters ahead of a <b>NATO</b> defense ministers meeting on Wednesday, DW reported.</p>
