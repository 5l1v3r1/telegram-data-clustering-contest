      <h1>Barcelona starlet to leave this January</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona’s prospect in Jean-Clair Todibo is set for a move away from the club in the coming January window.</h3>
      <p>As per Fox Sports, Barcelona are looking to sell him off as a part of their plan to offload 3-4 players in the coming transfer window. Bayer Leverkusen are the current favorites to land the 19 year-old.</p>
      <p>The defender has a bright future in the making and has so far managed to make only 4 appearances for the club. He has seen a steep increase in his value from £1 million at the time of his arrival at Barça last year, to £10 million as of now.</p>
      <p>As per reports, Watford were interested in the youngster for a brief period but they dropped their interest in him as soon as they learned about Bayer Leverkusen’s intentions.</p>
      <p>It is to be believed that Barça are also set to include a buy-back clause as Todibo has a lot of years left in his career and he’s a bright prospect for any club that he decides to be a part of. Hence it is completely natural that Barcelona want to have a backup plan regarding Todibo in this matter.</p>
      <p>Todibo arrived last year for a sum of £1 million but hasn’t been able to break into the first team on a consistent basis. Hence a stint at a club like Bayer Leverkusen will be the best move for the youngster.</p>
      <p>Barça should go ahead with the deal as they are looking to sign a few players in the coming transfer window and naturally, some additional funds will be required. Moreover, they need their future center-back to be ready for the time they need him the most.</p>
