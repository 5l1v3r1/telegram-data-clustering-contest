      <p>A Question Time audience member has refused to believe he is in the top 5% of earners despite raking in £80,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Rob Barber went on the BBC flagship show and complained about Labour’s election policy of planning a 45p rate on earnings over that figure.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s party are adamant that their proposed tax hike would only affect the top 5% of earners.</p>
      <p>The average UK salary is £29,000 and figures from the Office for National Statistics show that anyone earning more than £75,300 is in the top 5%.</p>
      <p>His rant has now gone viral with him refusing to believe Labour’s statistics, calling them ‘liars’.</p>
      <p>He then goes on to suggest that his salary is not even in ‘the top 50% of earners.’</p>

      <p>Mr Barber, who is believed to be an IT consultant, said while jabbing his finger: ‘I’d like to call out Labour as liars.</p>

      <p>‘I am one of those people he will tax more and I am nowhere near in the top five so I calling you a liar.</p>
      <p>‘That 5% is a lie, I am nowhere near that and you are going to tax me as an employee.</p>
      <p>‘You are not going after the billionaires, you are going after the employees because it’s easy money and I have no choice because it’s PAYE.’</p>

      <p>Mr Barber was directing his anger towards Labour’s Richard Burgon who attempted to correct the mistake during the show in Bolton, Lancs.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘You are mistaken – we are not going to raise income tax apart from those in the top 5%.</p>
      <p>‘And that’s why we are not going to increase your income tax.’</p>
      <p>Question Time chair Fiona Bruce attempted to clarify how much the man earnt and why he thought he did not fall within the top level of earners.</p>
      <p>He said he did earn above the £80,000 threshold just like ‘every doctor, every accountant and every solicitor.’</p>
      <p>Official figures suggest all those professions fall below £80,000 – a doctor on £76,000, an accountant on £62,000 and a solicitor around £43,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Burgon pointed out then when he was a solicitor he was paid around £40,000.</p>
      <p>Under Labour’s plan, Mr Barber would have to pay roughly an extra £50 for every £1,000 he earns over £80,000.</p>
