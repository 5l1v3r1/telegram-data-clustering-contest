      <h1>Security of tenure for casual, contractual workers in gov’t pushed</h1>

      <h3>A PARTY-LIST lawmaker has sought the passage of a proposed law mandating the security of tenure for all government casual and contractual employees who have rendered the prescribed years of service in the national agencies and the local government units.</h3>
      <p>“The government is the biggest employer which practices contractualization. The government creates casual and contractual positions and hire workers to the said positions year after year. This proves that the said positions are necessary to the operation of the concerned agencies, yet the employees are not considered regular or permanent,” said Magdalo party-list Rep. Manuel Cabochan in filing his House Bill (HB) No. 52</p>
      <p>According to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), there are about 96,000 employed contractual workers or those who perform certain tasks until their contract expires. Meanwhile, there are about 36,600 casual employees or those who are hired on occasional or temporary basis only.</p>
      <p>The CSC also added that there are currently 158,477 unfilled regular positions in the government.</p>
      <p>HB No. 52, also known as “An Act Providing for Security of Tenure for all Casual and Contractual Employees of the Government”, then provides that all incumbent casual and contractual government employees who have rendered at least 5 years of continuous service in national government agencies or a total of 10 years of continuous service in local government units be entitled to security of tenure.</p>
      <p>“It is espoused not only in our labor statutes, but also in our very Constitution that all workers are entitled to security of tenure. I believe these workers have already accumulated the necessary experience and skills to do their functions in the government productively and effectively. Nararapat lamang na sila ay maging regular,” Cabochan argued.</p>
      <p>Cabochan said the bill ultimately seeks to ensure that contractual and casual employees in the government be given the equal opportunity to serve the Filipino people as regular employees and whose contributions are critical for our country’s progress.</p>
