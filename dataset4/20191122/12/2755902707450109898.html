      <h1>PIC: Getting Creative With “Meat” As Austerity Measures Bite Hard</h1>

      <p>It seems like the season for austerity measures may not be going away just yet. Impoverished Zimbabweans who are struggling from the economic hardships plaguing he country noted that the austerity measures seem to be biting hard across the border as well.</p>
      <p>Weary Zimbabweans smiled in solidarity after seeing images which seem to be from Botswana of what is labelled as “Cook Bones”. This appears to be a euphemism as the cook bones are actually leftover chicken bones which seem to have been gathered from a fast-food restaurant.</p>
      <p>It seems highly unlikely that the “cook bones” are meant for human consumption and may have been meant dogs. However, this is the first time that many have come across leftovers being repackaged in this way for consumption either by humans or animals.</p>
