      <p>A teenager was hospitalised for a week when lip fillers left her with ‘deformed, rock solid sausage lips’.</p>
      <p>Lauren Winstanley, 18, suffers from low self-esteem and decided a fuller pout would improve her ‘small lips’.</p>
      <p>However, after undergoing the £170 procedure on October 2, she was left terrified that she could ‘lose her lip’.</p>
      <p>The young woman, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, says her lips began to swell ‘straight away’ after she went in for the 1.5ml plumping procedure.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘They started swelling straight away, when I looked in the mirror at them I was shocked because I’d never seen myself with bigger lips.</p>
      <p>‘The beautician said the swelling would go down and I listened to her and thought ‘fair enough’.</p>
      <p>‘They were hurting ahead of my night shift starting and over the next few hours they grew bigger and bigger and ended up triple the size they should be.</p>

      <p>‘When I left work my bottom lip in particular was massive and it was starting to feel really sore.’</p>
      <p>After messaging the beautician who performed the procedure, Lauren was assured the swelling was normal.</p>
      <p>However, she started to ‘panic’ and felt unwell so went to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary to get medical help.</p>
      <p>After staff assessed her lips, she was sent home with a course of antibiotics and painkillers.</p>
      <p>But the pain got steadily worse and the teen was forced to dial 999.</p>
      <p>She was rushed to Whiston Hospital where she was told she had a Group A strep infection.</p>
      <p>Lauren then underwent surgery to drain the infection and remove the infected filler, but was left worrying she could lose her lip.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘I was crying because I was in that much pain, when I looked in the mirror I remember thinking I looked deformed, it was vile.</p>
      <p>‘My lips looked like rock solid sausages and felt bruised and were stinging.</p>
      <p>‘I started to feel sick, had a temperature and my neck and cheek felt bruised.</p>
      <p>‘I was put on IV antibiotics and painkillers straight away and they did blood tests, which showed I had Group A strep infection.</p>

      <p>‘I couldn’t eat or drink as my lips were still triple their usual size and kept growing and filling with green and yellow pus.</p>
      <p>‘They were that full under my lip you could see little white holes, which was the infection working its way out of my lip.</p>
      <p>‘I could feel my chin keep getting wet from the infection in my lip leaking out.</p>

      <p>‘When the doctor tried draining them while I was awake I ended up screaming and crying.</p>
      <p>‘I begged them to put me to sleep while they drained them as I was in agony.</p>
      <p>‘When I looked at myself in the mirror it knocked me sick, my lips were disgusting.</p>
      <p>‘I have really bad low self-esteem as it is and this was making me feel worse.</p>
      <p>‘Thinking I could lose my lip was also freaking me out.’</p>
      <p>After spending a week in hospital, Lauren was discharged with antibiotics and painkillers.</p>
      <p>However, she has been left with lumpy lips, a partial loss of sensation and pain when she presses down in her lower lip.</p>

      <p>The salon owner was contacted for comment and said she thought the swollen lips were due to an ‘infection’ Lauren caught and was not related to the filler.</p>
      <p>Lauren has since heard that the beautician who did her lip fillers was trained five months earlier.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>She claims she wouldn’t have gone to her if she knew she had so little experience and wants to urge others to only get lip fillers if they are done by a medically trained professional.</p>
      <p>Lauren said: ‘I wish I’d have paid extra and had it done by someone medically trained like a dentist or dermal nurse.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve since found out that she’d not even been doing them for five months when I had them done.</p>
      <p>‘It’s put me off getting them done again in future. I would never wish that pain on anyone, it was traumatising.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘They’re all lumpy and when I press down there’s a sharp pain in my lower lip and the bottom left-hand side of my lip feels slightly numb.</p>
      <p>‘To anyone who is thinking of getting their lips done, do your research properly.</p>
      <p>‘Go to someone who is medically trained and who is able to deal with any problems that might occur.’</p>
      <p>Professor Ash Mosahebi, Council Member for BAAPS, said: ‘Giving treatments in a non-clinical environment without backup and emergency facilities is hazardous even in the expert hand.</p>
      <p>‘When this is combined with poorly trained practitioner then it is a recipe for disaster.’</p>
