      <p>It seems that all the odds are stacked against Bitcoin (BTC) once again. Over the past few days, the leading cryptocurrency has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-loses-8000-week-long-battle-price/">lost the key $8,000 support level</a> for the umpteenth time in a matter of a few weeks, tumbling from that level to $7,400 over the past 48 hours.</p>
      <h4>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-price-jumped-42-last-time-it-hit-this-level-and-btc-has-tapped-it-again/">Bitcoin Price Jumped 42% Last Time It Hit This Level, and BTC Has Tapped It Again</a></h4>
      <p>While BTC remains a tad above the $7,300 low seen in late October, analysts suggest that the crypto market is ready to head lower. Peter Schiff, for instance, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-readying-to-drop-85-to-1000-schiff-says/">said on Thursday</a> that he expects for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> to fall towards $1,000, which would mark a decline of over 85%. He backed his target by noting that the cryptocurrency is trading in the midst of an extended head and shoulders chart pattern, which is currently looking poised to breakdown.</p>
      <p>Though, a key bull indicator that is unlikely to be invalidated is approaching, signaling that there may be a bullish case for the crypto market after all.</p>
      <h3>Key Bitcoin Bull Cross Approaching</h3>
      <p>Like Jack in Titanic, it seems as though it’s over for bulls. After surging 42% in a single day’s time at the end of October, Bitcoin has retraced the entirety of that move, with bulls failing to sustain the bullish trend that could’ve formed should a drop post-surge failed.</p>
      <p>Though, this isn’t the end of the world, according to the 50-week and 100-week moving averages anyway. <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoBull/status/1197608304765292545">Analyst Crypto Bull recently observed</a> that these two moving averages are about to see an extremely <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/05/crypto-trader-bitcoin-closes-in-on-life-changing-golden-cross/">bullish “golden cross”</a> in the coming one or two weeks, with the short-term average crossing above the long-term one. This implies that bulls have control of the market in the long term, not bears.</p>
      <p>Indeed, this specific golden cross seemingly kickstarted the parabolic bull run that brought Bitcoin from $1,000 to $20,000 last cycle.</p>

      <p>As Bull further notes, the last time this happened was in 2016, just months prior to the last halving and when the price of BTC was down 62% from its all-time high. What would you know? Bitcoin is currently 62% down from its all-time high and it is a few months out from the next halving.</p>
      <p>History repeating would see the leading cryptocurrency begin its next parabolic run-up once the cross takes place by the end of the year, barring an utter collapse in the crypto markets.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the only bullish argument that has been proposed over recent days. Trader Coiner Yadox<a href="https://twitter.com/Yodaskk/status/1196399730378641408"> recently noted</a> that Bitcoin’s price action from the long-term bottom of $3,150 established in December of 2018 until now looks much like a textbook Richard Wyckoff pattern, which is marked by a strong surge upward after a bear market, a double-top pattern, an accumulation throwback, and then a bullish continuation after a bullish breakout.</p>
      <p>Yadox suggested that should his interpretation of this Wyckoff pattern be correct, Bitcoin found a medium-term bottom at $7,400, and will <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/wyckoff-bitcoin-bottom-in-price-14000-bull/">soon see a strong breakout to the upside.</a></p>
