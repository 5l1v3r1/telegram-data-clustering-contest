      <p>"I absolutely devastated and heartbroken.</p>

      <p>Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston, who leads the Major Investigation Team (West) said: “Although a year has now passed we are still as determined as ever to track down Billyjoe’s killer.</p>
      <p>"We are being meticulous and thorough with our inquiry and I am confident that we will make a significant breakthrough. I believe that there are people in the local community who know who is responsible for this murder.</p>
      <p>"His family has been devastated by his death and they deserve closure. The person responsible must be brought to justice.</p>
      <p>“We will trace whoever is responsible for this murder, but we would appreciate any information people can provide.</p>
      <p>"Please don’t wait for the police to visit you at home. Do the right thing.</p>
      <p>"I can assure anyone with concerns that information passed to us will be treated in the utmost confidence.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information regarding Billyjoe’s murder, no matter how insignificant it may seem, should contact officers through 101 quoting reference number 2422 of Sunday 18 November 2018.</p>
