      <p>Voyager guitarist Scott Kay has recorded a progged up cover of Australian electronic duo's Hermitude's <i>The Buzz</i>. Kay has hooked up with emerging Perth singer-songwriter Bronte on the new version. You can listen to the cover below.</p>
      <p>“I remember hearing this tune in 2015 and loving the vibe and the drop," Kay tells <i>Prog</i>. "I thought to myself; this would make for a sick modern progressive metal cover because of the grooves in it, and so after some tinkering and coming up with a couple of riffs, here we have it!</p>
      <p>"Hermitude are an electronic duo from New South Wales, and have produced a pretty eclectic mix of tunes, which I really enjoy. They made pretty big waves with their album <i>Dark Night Sweet Light</i>, of which <i>The Buzz</i> was one of the bangers from it.”</p>
      <p><i>The Buzz</i> has been mixed and mastered by Matt Templeman, who worked with  <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/voyager-announce-new-album-colours-in-the-sun">Voyager on their latest album <i>Colours in the Sun</i></a>.</p>
