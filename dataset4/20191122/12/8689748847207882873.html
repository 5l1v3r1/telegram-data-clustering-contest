      <p>Sensational Afro pop singer and songwriter Noella Wiyaala , widely known as the lioness of Africa has a piece of advice for all those who travel to other countries for greener pastures.</p>
      <p>Wiyaala who is noted for always infusing her native languages which are Dagaree, Sissala and Waala, into her music says it’s her way of holding on to her root and tradition.</p>

      <p>According to Wiyaala, her style of music always makes her stand out among her colleagues in the industry.</p>
      <p>Speaking on NRK TV in Norway, Wiyaala noted that she tries as much as possible to mix her native language into the lyrics of her songs.</p>
      <p>“if you don’t know the difference you will think it is one language but it is actually different languages.” she explained.</p>
      <p>Known as the Lioness of Africa due to the energy she exudes on stage, Wiyaala has  cautioned African parents to teach their kids their traditional languages so that their kids will not lose their identity.</p>
      <p>“Every parent must teach their child their local dialect, if you don’t do that, it’s very embarrassing and when you go home they will be making fun of you… it is one thing you have to learn ‘compulsory by force,'” she added.</p>
      <p>Wiyaala who  is currently in Norway   during the interview perfomed one of her hit songs titled “Tan Da Gree” which she explained to mean the Rock and the Sand.</p>
      <p>“Tan Da Gree” used to be her school rhyme with moral lessons stating “You need not copy people blindly, else you will find yourself wanting.” she explained.</p>
