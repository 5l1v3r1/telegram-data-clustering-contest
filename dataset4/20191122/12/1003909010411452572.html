      <h1>Brookman: How can we restore respect in our schools?</h1>

      <p>I threw a book at a girl once. Her name was Lynn Douglas and I remember the moment as if it were yesterday. I was in Grade 5 and within minutes at Queen’s Park School in Mount Pleasant I heard the words over the PA, “Mr. Brookman, please come to the office immediately.” </p>
      <p>I didn’t cry, but I wanted to. Our principal was Mr. Broadberry and he was a tall, serious Englishman with a moustache and highly polished shoes. He was likely 35, but to me, he felt like he was a hundred-year-old giant.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Brookman” he said. “Did you throw a book at Miss Douglas?” </p>
      <p>“Yes, sir,” I managed to get out, all the time eyeing the leather strap that was sitting conspicuously on the desk in the office.  </p>
      <p>“Can you tell me why you did that?” he pressed and I responded, “She called me Georgie Peorgie and I really hate that.” </p>
      <p>When I think back about it, I am sure he was having trouble not laughing out loud, but he did not waver. </p>
      <p>“Mr. Brookman, do you understand that it is unacceptable, at any time, ever, to throw anything at a girl?”  </p>
      <p>“Yes, sir,” I responded. </p>
      <p>“All right then,” he said. “You may go back to your class. I suggest you apologize to Miss Douglas, and I never want to hear about anything like this again.”</p>
      <p>Believe me, he didn’t and I managed to get all the way through Grade 12 without ever getting the strap. The image of that strap, however, sitting on that desk never left my mind to this very day.</p>
      <p>I thought of all of this back in October when I read the story of Devan Bracci-Selvey who was stabbed to death in front of his mother at a Hamilton, Ont., high school.  Reports say that the boy had been bullied for some time, but that there had been little the school, the staff or the parents could do to prevent this from happening, and, of course, it finally peaked the day of this horrific incident.   </p>
      <p>How can our society have reached the stage where a teacher is afraid or unable to deal with discipline problems without fear of reprisal or criticism? It sounds so “old fashioned” today to say, “When I was a boy …” If the teacher said I was doing something wrong, there was no doubt in my parents’ mind that I was, indeed, doing something wrong.</p>
      <p>Yet when you read the news, listen to radio interviews or watch television, it always seems that there is some loudly vocal parent or group who are complaining that the system has somehow wronged their children. Today, it seems that teachers are not only faced with the historic challenges of teaching and keeping order in the classroom, but also faced with the added burden of defending their actions.</p>
      <p>No one wants to return to the days of abusive punishment, of sitting in the corner with a dunce cap on or anything like that.</p>
      <p>I have a lot of sympathy for teachers who have been spit on, yelled at or bitten.</p>
      <p>I remember that even the sight of that strap, sitting on that desk almost 60 years ago, was enough to make an impression that has stayed with me for all of this time.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it is time that we just focus a bit more on respect for each other and for elders or fundamentally for the basic rules that make us a society. Can it really be that hard to do?</p>
