      <h1>GBP/USD Technical Analysis: Bears might aim towards challenging 1.2800 handle</h1>

          <b>Disappointing UK PMI prints for November drags the pair below the 1.2900 handle.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The near-term technical set-up seems to have shifted in favour of bearish traders.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The GBP/USD pair held on to its weaker tone through the mid-European session on Friday, albeit has managed to rebound around 20 pips from weekly lows and is currently hovering around the 1.2880-85 region.<br/> <br/>A sustained break below the 1.2900 round-figure mark, coinciding with 200-hour SMA, was seen as a key trigger for bearish traders following the release of weaker-than-expected flash UK <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">PMI</a> prints for November.<br/> <br/>Against the backdrop of the pair’s repeated failure ahead of the key 1.30 psychological mark, acceptance below the mentioned handle now support prospects for a further near-term depreciating move.<br/> <br/>Hence, some follow-through weakness, back towards challenging the 1.2800 handle, now looks a distinct possibility, albeit slightly oversold conditions on the hourly <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> warrant some caution for bearish traders.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, any attempted recovery beyond the 1.2900 support breakpoint might now confront some fresh supply near the 1.2925-30 region, above which the pair is likely to aim back towards the 1.30 handle.</p>
