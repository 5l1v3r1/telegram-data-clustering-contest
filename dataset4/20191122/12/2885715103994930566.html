      <p>Indian pacers got the Bangladesh team dancing to their tune on Day 1, dismissing them by Tea for a total of 106 in 30.3 overs.</p>

      <p>All the ten wickets to fall were taken by pacers – only the fourth time in India that the national team have done this. The last time this has happened was in 2017 vs Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens. There have been two other times this happened  – in 1983 vs West Indies in Ahmedabad and in 1981 vs England in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>In fact, there was only one over of spin bowled by India on the day – with strike bowler <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravichandran-ashwin/">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> not even called on to bowl. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravindra-jadeja/">Ravindra Jadeja</a> bowled the solitary over of spin in the innings, conceding 5 runs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> was the pick of the pacers, becoming the first Indian bowler with a pink ball Test fifer with his figures of 5/22. This was Ishant’s first Test fifer at home in 12 years.</p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> (3/29) took two wickets in a single over to rattle the Bangladesh top order. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a> chipped in with 2/36.</p>
      <p>“I never thought I would say this about India’s pace bowlers in my lifetime, but Indian pacers have blown away Bangladesh today,” Sunil Gavaskar said on commentary. Gavaskar would have had special reason to have highlighted the significance of this. During his playing days, he had often been called upon to bowl as the second seamer to take the shine off the new ball.</p>
      <p>Unusually for Tests in India, the home side’s pace battery overshadowed the spinners in the 1st Test vs Bangladesh as well, but not to extent that only one over of spin was possible.</p>
