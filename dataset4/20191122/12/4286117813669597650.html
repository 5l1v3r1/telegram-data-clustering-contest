      <h1>Adithya Varma Movie Review: Dhruv Vikram is faithful in Arjun Reddy remake</h1>
      <h2>Dhruv Vikram makes a strong debut with Adithya Varma, but the story gets repetitive if you have watched Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh.</h2>

      <p><b>Movie Name:</b> Adithya Varma<br/><b>Director:</b> Girisayya</p>
      <p>Adithya Varma marks the debut of Vikram’s son Dhruv in Kollywood. And he gets his act right with his earnest performance. When Arjun Reddy is remade in multiple languages, the safest bet for directors is to adapt a frame-by-frame remake and that’s what first-time director Girisayya has done with Adithya Varma as well.</p>
      <p>For those who have watched Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh, Adithya Varma is just the Tamil version of the film with a change in cast and dialogues. But, if there is anything that the film gets right, it is the casting of Dhruv Vikram. He tries to ape Vijay Deverakonda and also adds his freshness to the character of Adithya Varma.</p>
      <p>Let’s face it, the story of Adithya Varma is now very close to everyone’s hearts as almost all of us have seen Arjun Reddy or at least heard about the film. The love-drama follows the story of a hot-headed surgeon named Adithya Varma, who has anger management issues. He falls deeply in love with his college junior, Meera Shetty. When situations force them to call off their relationship, Adithya Varma suffers from alcoholism, drug overdose and other issues. How he deals with his breakup forms the rest of the story.</p>
      <p>Director Girisayya was Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s first associate and this is one of the reasons why the film has retained the essence of the original. But, Adithya Varma has the same flaws as Arjun Reddy. The film deals with a problematic hero and the scenes which glorify toxic masculinity and misogyny are there in both films.</p>
      <p>When Arjun Reddy released in 2017, it was accepted by everyone. But, when the same film is rewatched in a post #MeToo world, it makes you question the activities of the protagonist. The Tamil version is as lengthy as Arjun Reddy and it gets a tad bit boring in the second half.</p>
      <p>Dhruv Vikram’s performance is the high point of Adithya Varma and he is overtly faithful to his character. However, the weak link in the Tamil remake is Banita Sandhu’s underwhelming performance. She has very limited range of expressions to offer which is not what we expect from a character who doesn’t speak a lot.</p>
      <p>Composer Radhan’s background score is the soul of the film. When the theme music plays, you can’t help but watch Dhruv waltz through the frame with much aplomb. The background music and the songs are almost the same with just a change in lyrics.</p>
      <p>The dialogues of Adithya Varma could have been a little bit better. It lacked the depth and seriousness which brought down the emotional quotient of the film.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Adithya Varma is a faithful remake of Arjun Reddy with the soul of the film retained. With minor flaws and some great performances, Adithya Varma is a decent watch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3 out of 5 stars for Adithya Varma.</b>
