      <h1>Westbury-on-Trym plant emporium forced to close after 20 years</h1>
      <h2>Business owner Julien Carey will be 75-years-old in January, days after his shop closes for good</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:07:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Kate Wilson</a></address>
      <p>For more than two decades community stalwart Julien Carey could be seen perched between two shop fronts in Westbury Village behind a wall of plants. </p>
      <p>His shop Garden Trappings has been the go to for local customers looking to get their potted plants, hanging baskets or Christmas wreaths for the last 20 years.</p>
      <p>But sadly this will be 74-year-old Julien’s last <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> selling in the village after he received a phone call earlier this week telling him to pack up and close the store down.</p>
      <p>Originally he was given a month’s notice from the landlord - who owns both the yard where Garden Trappings is located as well as the building next door which used to be home to Westbury Inks.</p>
      <p>But Julien said he was unwilling to lose his Christmas trade and has managed to negotiate that the store will remain open until the first week in January.</p>
      <p>However as of January 3, Westbury Village will lose another business and another local institution in what will be another knock to the high street.</p>
      <p>There are at least seven empty units in the village - which for a small high street is a sizeable chunk of boarded up shops - some of which have been vacant for years.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately the closure of Garden Trappings will only add to the problem.</p>

      <p>For Julien, he remembers visiting <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/westbury-on-trym">Westbury-on-Trym</a> when his parents first moved to the area in 1974.</p>
      <p>“Part of the reason they moved here was because there was no reason to go into Bristol city centre. You could get everything you needed right here in the village.</p>
      <p>“It was really a bustling community, but it’s basically been death by a thousand cuts.</p>
      <p>“A shop here going, a shop there going. We did have two or three grocers, a lovely deli, a furniture shop.</p>
      <p>“Now we have seven empty shops and the high street is basically dying on its feet. Until these shops are filled I worry that Westbury has gone beyond the tipping point.”</p>
      <p>Julien officially moved to Westbury-on-Trym in the mid-90s after his dad died in order to look after his mum.</p>
      <p>After working on the markets for a few years he decided to open up his own indoor market in Westbury Village - making use of one of the empty units at the time.</p>
      <p>Westbury Bazaar opened on Canford Lane in the late 90s in what is now home to the Grupo Lounge.</p>
      <p>It remained open for nine years before, Julien decided to close it down and open his own little plant emporium in the yard next door to the shop. Garden Trappings has been there ever since.</p>

      <p>But now the village plant shop will go the same way as the Lloyds Pharmacy and butchers which the village lost years ago.</p>
      <p>“If I was 10 years younger, I probably would have had to be dragged screaming and kicking from the place,” adds Julien.</p>
      <p>“But as it is I’m going to be 75-years-old in January and I had a heart attack last year, so maybe it is my time to go.</p>
      <p>“For me what I will miss is the day-to-day interaction with customers - many of whom have become good friends.”</p>
      <p>As much as Julien will miss his customers, it seems that they are probably going to miss him just as much.</p>
      <p>Dozens of people responded to Julien’s Facebook post explaining that he was being forced to close with messages of sympathy and genuine sadness that they would no longer get to see him working in the village every day.</p>
      <p>“I was amazed by the feeling shared on social media when I announced I was going, I really couldn’t believe it,” added Julien.</p>
      <p>“People have been coming up to me all week and giving me a cuddle, saying how sorry they are to see me go.</p>
      <p>“It’s lovely to know that after more than 20 years I have made an impact here.”</p>
