      <p>We may only be a few episodes into the latest series of The Young Offenders, but the immensely popular show has today been confirmed for a third season by the BBC.</p>
      <p>Peter Foott's iconic production will go for the hat-rick after enjoying phenomenal success thus far.</p>
      <p>Series two of The Young Offenders sees Conor and Jock up to their usual skulduggery.</p>
      <p>Whilst Jock is on the precipice of fatherhood, Conor is still trying to navigate the tricky channels of young love and the second season is going down a storm with Irish and UK viewers alike.</p>
      <p>The opening episode of season two drew an average audience of 370,100 viewers on RTÉ2.</p>

      <p>The Echo was on set with some of the cast a couple of months ago and gained a sneak peek of the filming of series three.</p>
      <p>Speaking to actress Hilary Rose, who plays Conor's mother in the hit show, she chatted about the success of The Young Offenders</p>
      <blockquote>"When we saw the final product of the film, we kind of thought, we’ve got something special here."</blockquote>
      <p>Chris Walley (Jock) said the success of the show can be largely accredited to Foott's incredible writing:</p>
      <p>"I think that’s what Peter does so well with the writing is that there are all these conflicts and all these character flaws and then the characters always learn from them.</p>
      <p>"They come full circle but rest assured the next episode will go back to the same antics again!</p>
      <p>"But they are developing themselves," he said.</p>
      <p>On set, the cast all noted their excitement for the third series, which from what we saw, looks like it will sustain the momentum of the previous two series.</p>
      <p>The best might yet be to come for our two lovable rogues.</p>
