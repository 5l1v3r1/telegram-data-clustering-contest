      <p>Edible Arrangements is now selling CBD-infused edibles.</p>
      <p>Not be confused with edible marijuana products, CBD is not psycho-active.</p>
      <p>The new product line is called Incredible Edibles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>   •  <a href="https://6abc.com/health/are-you-getting-whats-advertised-in-cbd-products/5712017/">Investigation: Are you getting what's advertised in CBD products?</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The CBD-infused treats include smoothies, chocolate-dipped fruit and baked goods.</p>
      <p>The slogan is "Health, Not High."</p>
      <p>Proponents of CBD do say it has benefits like helping to manage inflammation and treating conditions like insomnia.</p>
      <p>CBD has become a mainstream phenomenon since the passage of the U.S. Farm Bill last year, which legalized hemp with some conditions.</p>
      <p>The Food and Drug Administration still has not decided how to regulate CBD products.</p>
      <p>As of now, the incredible edibles products are only available in Dallas.</p>
      <p>But the company plans to roll it out to 200 stores by the end of the year.</p>
