      <p>New research shows it can cost over £75,436 to raise a child up to the age of 18.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, families are having to think outside of the box to make the most of their budget and try and save money where possible - and one mum has revealed how using her Nectar card to clothe her children can help save a ton of cash.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Nicola Shakespeare brought nearly £108 worth of kids' clothes for just £7.70 at Sainsbury's thanks to a handy Nectar trick .</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old mum made the most of a double-up offer, picking up a load of bargains in the process, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mum-snaps-up-108-worth-20934242">reports The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>"I’d been notified about the Nectar offer on email and then forgot about it, but saw it on social media and thought 'I really need to do this before I lose the chance to'," the thrifty mum told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10377878/mum-108-worth-kids-clothes-8-nectar-trick/">The Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>Nicola, from Porchester in Hampshire, lives with partner Daniel, 41 and their young family.</p>
      <p>She recently posted photos of her haul in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeCouponingAndBargainsUK/permalink/902379476842018/">Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK Facebook group</a> .</p>
      <p>It included kids' pyjamas, trousers, socks, and school dresses for her two kids and Daniel's two children - three girls and one boy between the ages two and 12 years old.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the trove, which was 26 items all together, she said: "I was quite lucky, because I caught the end of the sale so a lot of stuff was half-price already.</p>
      <p>"It was all the silly bits that you forget about when you’re doing the Christmas shopping - pyjamas, socks, pants - that was on sale."</p>
      <p>The mum, who works as a finance manager, said many of the items used as Christmas gifts - putting a huge dent in her annual festive spending, she explained: "The things I bought in the offer were on my list to get for Christmas anyway."</p>

      <p>She also bagged a pair Dumbo pyjamas for herself, and a fluffy dinosaur outfit and a grey knitted set for a friend's baby shower.</p>
      <p>"The Dumbo pyjamas is a little Christmas treat for myself, the shopping and all the wrapping I've done," Nicola added.</p>
      <p>She revealed she is not necessarily a bargain hunter, but is just savvy when it comes to collecting reward points.</p>
      <p>Nicola buys nappies and wet wipes for her two-year-old at Boots, -racking up almost £200 worth of points this year. She also fills up her car tank at Tesco or Sainsbury's to gain extra points earning her a free Merlin pass every year, meaning the school holidays are cheaper and more fun when they come around.</p>
      <p>She said: "I’ve got loyalty cards for pretty much everywhere.</p>
      <p>"I just keep the points and whenever something like this comes through, it's like a little bonus.</p>

      <p>"You get rewarded just for doing your food shopping."</p>
      <p>The Nectar Double Up scheme allows you to swap 1,000 (normally worth £5) to 10,000 points (normally worth £50) for a voucher worth twice the value.</p>
      <p>You can exchange up to 10,000 points per Nectar card account, which means you could turn £50 worth of vouchers into £100.</p>
