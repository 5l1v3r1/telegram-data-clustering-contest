      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eamonn-holmes/">Eamonn Holmes</a> made a childhood dream come true on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> as he dusted off his best Elvis impression…in front of the actual Priscilla Presley.</p>
      <p>Safe to say, Ruth <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ruth-langsford/">Langsford</a> was absolutely mortified and couldn’t stop apologising to the American icon.</p>
      <p>Crossing from the other side of the sofa, the 59 year-old turned up his collars (quite literally), sat himself right next to the actual wife of the actual Elvis Presley…and gave a little rendition of Suspicious Minds.</p>
      <p>Eamonn looked like he was a having blast, Ruth looked like she wanted the ground to swallow her up and Priscilla looked like she wasn’t sure if she was in some kind of twisted dream.</p>
      <p>‘I’m so sorry,’ the presenter’s long-suffering wife said as she dried her eyes. ‘Oh my goodness. I’m so sorry Priscilla.’</p>
      <p>Although ITV’s newest Elvis impersonator didn’t stop, looking down both cameras and giving a show for the ages.</p>

      <p>‘Security!’ the Loose Women anchor said finally. ‘Please take this man away.’</p>

      <p>Priscilla herself just had one piece of advice for Ruth: ‘Help him.’</p>
      <p>Oh, trust us, Priscilla. We’re sure she’s tried.</p>
      <p>The married couple were also joined on the sofa by The X Factor: Celebrity contestant Vinnie Jones, who discussed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/vinnie-joneslate-wife-tanya-arranged-a-party-to-celebrate-25th-wedding-anniversary-before-her-death-11200737/">the one surprise his late wife Tanya arranged for her family before her death</a>.</p>
      <p>‘She planned [something for] New Year’s Eve,’ Vinnie revealed to the presenting duo. ‘I’m flying everybody over to Los Angeles, I have a house in Palm Springs.</p>
      <p>‘I’m bringing everyone there to celebrate our 25th anniversary, she wanted to put it on. She made all the arrangements. We have to fulfill them.’</p>
      <p>Vinnie was also embroiled in one of the most controversial X Factor moments in years last weekend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/kevin-mchale-eliminated-from-the-x-factor-celebrity-as-simon-cowell-refuses-to-let-vinnie-jones-drop-out-11168924/">after he attempted to quit the competition</a> after finding himself in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>In the bottom two against Glee’s Kevin McHale, the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels star pleaded with Simon Cowell to allow him to exit the competition for McHale to continue.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the music mogul was having none of it and McHale was eliminated.</p>
      <p>Despite the controversy,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/vinnie-jones-confirmed-stay-x-factor-celebrity-trying-quit-simon-cowell-boss-11175520/"> Vinnie has confirmed that he will be returning to the stage</a> this weekend.</p>
