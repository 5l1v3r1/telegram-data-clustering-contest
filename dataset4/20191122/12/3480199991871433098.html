      <p>Emergency services were called at about 11.15am today.</p>
      <p>A police cordon was in place outside Central Square nightclub as investigators took photographs and tried to establish what might have happened.</p>
      <p>The fire service were in attendance, as were a number of road ambulances and several police vehicles.</p>
      <p>People nearby were in shock as events unfolded. Margaret Wilson, who was shopping in town, said: "There was a lot of noise and commotion. It sounded like the poor lady was in quite a bit of pain.</p>
      <p>"It was all quiet one minute and then all these police cars appeared. I hope the lady is going to be alright."</p>

      <p>Another shopper said: "There was panic and it became very busy. There were many emergency vehicles. I expect the police will be there a long time."</p>
      <p>Concerned passers-by stopped to see what had happened. St Mary's Street was closed but by 12.30pm, traffic was moving as normal in the area.</p>
      <p>Claire Brown, spokeswoman for West Midlands Ambulance Service, said an ambulance, paramedic officer and the Midlands Air Ambulance attended.</p>
