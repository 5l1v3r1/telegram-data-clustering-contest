      <p>22 November 2019 - NZSO media release for immediate release</p>
      <p><b>Star line-up of singers and conductor for NZSO’s <i>Messiah </i>in Wellington</b><br/><br/><br/><br/>Acclaimed Australian conductor and Handel scholar <a href="https://www.nzso.co.nz/concerts-and-tickets/featured-artists/graham-abbott/">Graham Abbott</a> returns to conduct the <b>New Zealand Symphony Orchestra</b>’s annual must-see performance of the masterwork <b><i>Messiah</i></b>.</p>
      <p>Maestro Abbott wowed audiences and critics when he conducted <i>Messiah</i> with the NZSO in 2012 and 2016. Wellington’s <i>The Dominion Post</i> praised his 2016 concert as “from the very top drawer”.</p>
      <p>“Absolutely first class playing,” said RNZ Concert. “Graham Abbott the conductor is to be congratulated … It was all splendidly done.”</p>
      <p>Maestro Abbott has conducted <i>Messiah</i> 74 times and his NZSO concert will be his 75th performance. He never tires of <i>Messiah</i> or Handel. “I’ve adored the man and his music since childhood. Performances of <i>Messiah</i> are always thrilling because I know the audience is expecting something special. And it’s Handel, so to me that makes it special.”</p>
      <p><i>Messiah</i> also features four superb Australasian vocalists. Celebrated Australian soprano <a href="https://www.nzso.co.nz/concerts-and-tickets/featured-artists/celeste-lazarenko/">Celeste Lazarenko</a>, praised for her 2017 <i>Messiah</i> performance with the NZSO, returns with renowned New Zealand mezzo-soprano <a href="https://www.nzso.co.nz/concerts-and-tickets/featured-artists/anna-pierard/">Anna Pierard</a>, making her NZSO <i>Messiah</i> debut.</p>
      <p>Australian tenor <b>Andrew Goodwin</b>, who has performed with the world’s leading orchestras and opera companies makes his NZSO debut alongside New Zealand bass <b>Hadleigh Adams</b>, hailed by <i>New Yorker</i> critic Alex Ross as a “tour de force” following his 2017 performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic</p>
      <p>No performance of Handel’s oratorio is complete without a choir. This year the NZSO will be joined by the 140-member Orpheus Choir of Wellington.</p>
      <p><i>Messiah</i> will also be an opportunity for<b> </b>audiences in December to help those in need during the festive season.</p>
      <p>In partnership with <b>The Wellington City Mission</b>, the NZSO is supporting the charity’s annual Christmas Star Appeal. At <i>Messiah</i> audience members can donate food or funds to The Mission.</p>
      <p>“The Wellington City Mission is proud to partner with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and to be collecting at the Orchestra’s Christmas concerts. All donations received will make a big difference in the lives of people in need at Christmas,” says Murray Edridge, Wellington City Missioner.</p>
      <p><b>NOTES FOR EDITORS</b><br/><br/>George Frideric Handel’s <i>Messiah</i> was first performed in Dublin in 1742. The composer was looking for ways in which to create novel and compelling music and for <i>Messiah</i> to be enjoyed by everyone, whether they were nobility, landed gentry or commoner.</p>
      <p>Following the premiere, <i>Messiah</i> was so well received that within a few years it was regularly performed and is now one of the few works from the mid-1700s that has had a constant performance history. Today it is one of the most performed oratorios in the world and one of the best known. It was even reinterpreted in gospel, blues, jazz, R&amp;B and hip-hop for the 1992 album <i>Handel’s Messiah: A Soulful Celebration</i>, featuring Stevie Wonder.</p>
