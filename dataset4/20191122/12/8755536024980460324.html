      <p>Netflix has responded to reports that they’ve cast Imelda Staunton as the next Queen Elizabeth in The Crown.</p>
      <p>The actress is best known for her role as Dolores Umbridge in the Harry Potter films, and has also starred in Cranford, Little Britain, Shakespeare in Love, and the Downton Abbey movie.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail reported that the 64-year-old was set to replace Olivia Colman as the British monarch in the fifth and sixth series of The Crown.</p>
      <p>However, Netflix has slammed the report as “pure speculation”.</p>

      <p>In a statement obtained by Deadline, a Netflix spokesperson said: “We are currently filming season 4 of The Crown but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation.”</p>
      <p>The third season of The Crown premiered on Netflix on Sunday with all new actors.</p>
      <p>Taking over from Claire Foy, Olivia Colman plays Queen Elizabeth II, Tobias Menzie plays Prince Philip, Josh O’Connor stars as Prince Charles, Ben Daniels plays Lord Snowden, and Helena Bonham Carter shines as Princess Margaret.</p>

      <p>Helena has taken over the role from Vanessa Kirby, who played Princess Margaret in the first and second season.</p>
      <p>It’s believed the cast will play their royal roles for just two seasons before the actors will change once again, in order to portray the characters accurately as they age.</p>
