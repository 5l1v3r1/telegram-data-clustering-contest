      <h1>Terrell Owens says Max Kellerman is 'blacker' than Stephen A. Smith for stance on Colin Kaepernick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:34:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>Stephen A. Smith has taken plenty of criticism for his stance on Colin Kaepernick following the free agent quarterback's workout on Saturday. The latest critique comes from former NFL receiver Terrell Owens, who joined the "First Take" crew on Thursday to share his thoughts on the situation.</p>
      <p>However, Owens "crossed a line," according to Smith, when he said, "Max [Kellerman] almost seems blacker than you, Stephen A."</p>

      <p>Smith has been involved in a nearly a week-long debate about Kaepernick's workout, both on social media and on the ESPN show. His first comments on the situation came Saturday, after Kaepernick had <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-start-time-venue-nfl-workout/1n8phhiij0k0bzukozs57xmvr">changed locations for his workout</a> in front of NFL teams.</p>
      <p>Smith posted a video with the social copy, "He doesn't want to play." The video, which has gathered over five million views on the social media platform, opened Smith up to criticism.</p>

      <p>The ESPN analyst continued to discuss the issue throughout the week on "First Take," and was challenged by Kellerman during one episode.</p>
      <p>Kellerman said, in part:</p>
      <blockquote>"What am I to do with my privilege as a white man and as a person on TV with an enormous platform? Which, by the way, I benefit from the platform that you (Stephen A.) built primarily. What am I to do with that power? Right? Am I to support the power structure that, where injustice is ongoing, or should I speak truth to power using that privilege and that platform?<br/>"When you say things like, ‘Colin Kaepernick, who are you as a black man — and now you’re given this opportunity — who are you to ask questions about who the receivers are gonna be? Why it’s last minute?’ OK, you may be right. People may be right. Like, ‘Colin, it’s not going to be perfect. You’re asking them for a job. It’s not gonna be perfect.’ However, you know who I am? I’m a member of the media who will ask that question.<br/>"Why was the workout arranged in this way? Why was there an ultimatum with 48 hours to accept? Why was the waiver not the standard waiver? … Why only on that day? Why weren’t cameras allowed in? Why hasn’t he been working for three years? I will ask those questions, and I will also say while you can focus on the world we actually live in where you wear a Kunta Kinte shirt, the white billionaires aren’t going to like it. I am going to talk about the world we ought to live in. And bring pressure to bear that sooner than later we do live in world where ‘so the hell what someone shows up with a Kunta Kinte shirt.'"</blockquote>

      <p>As all of this unfolded, Smith continued to take in criticism from social media. He eventually received so much negative feedback that he felt he needed to point out, "I’m a black man, you idiots!"</p>

      </p>
      <p>Here's Smith's full quote from that taping:</p>
      <blockquote>"When I sit up there, and I sat here yesterday, and I spoke about how his points are eradicated, I’m not talking about the kneeling. I’m not talking about the protesting. I’m a black man, you idiots! You think I have a problem with a man that is kneeling and protesting racial oppression and police brutality? Do you know anything about my history in 25 years in this damn business? From The New York Daily News to the Philadelphia Inquirer to CNN to Fox to ESPN. Do you have any idea about my damn background and the fights that I have taken on the behalf of African Americans throughout this nation’s history? Do you have any idea who the hell you are talking about?”</blockquote>

      <p>All of this leads to Thursday's episode of "First Take" and Owen's comments. The full conversation is too long to get into within a single article, as Owens, Smith and Kellerman discussed the issue for nearly 12 minutes. But we'll address the aftermath of Owens' remark about Kellerman being "blacker" than Smith.</p>
      <p>The tenured ESPN reporter did not appreciate that comment, and let Owens know immediately after.</p>
      <p>"Time out, with all due respect my brother, I'm going to check you right now. You done crossed a line," Smith said. "First of all, like I said, you, Colin Kaepernick, Eric Reid, any of y'all that want to debate me in front of black people and talk about what's best for black people, name the time and place, I'll show up. What's the definition of blackness? Is there a definitive definition of blackness? Why are you giving the impression that because I don't march (in) lockstep with every single thing that Colin Kaepernick wants ..."</p>
      <p>At this point, Owens interrupted Smith's thoughts, but the analyst continued with a similar conversation.</p>
      <p>"You just sat up there and used an expression, 'more blacker.' Excuse me, I'm fromHollis Queens, New York City. You ain't the only brother out there that's in the streets. I'm in the streets every day. And you damn well know that's the truth. I'm not going to disrespect you, I'm not going to go that route."</p>

      <p>Owens later claimed he meant "no disrespect" with the comment and instead said it was "tongue in cheek."</p>
      <p>The segment ended shortly after as the show had to go to commercial break.</p>
