      <h1>Regeneration project for pretty North village which may look familiar to Vera fans</h1>
      <h2>Heritage Lottery-funded project to breathe new life into Blanchland, the only village in the country built on the remains of an abbey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Henderson</a></address>
      <p>A chuch built on abbey ruins will be at the centre this weekend of plans for the heritage-led regeneration of a picturesque village which may look familiar to fans of Vera and the Catherine Cookson dramas.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s free event at Blanchland, on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumbrian</a> side of the border with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a>, will see locals and visitors celebrate the village and its grade I-listed church.</p>
      <p>Abbey Alive! will showcase the church and explore imaginative ways in which it can be used to benefit the whole community.</p>

      <p>It is part of a major project supported by the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/heritage">National Heritage Lottery Fund</a>, which has awarded a £42,000 grant for a feasibility study into how to breathe new life into what is the only village in the country to be built on the footprint of an abbey.</p>
      <p>The original Blanchland Abbey was founded in the 12th century but was dissolved in 1539. The village was created in the 18th century by the Lord Crewe Trustees, who took over the estate.</p>
      <p>The church of St Mary the Virgin, also known as Blanchland Abbey, has parts dating from the 13th century and is a neighbour of the well-known Lord Crewe Arms.</p>
      <p>The church is the largest venue in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the aim is to place it at the heart of the project to boost the village and ensure its sustainability.</p>
      <p>The village has been the setting for many films and television series, from Vera to Wolfblood, Catherine Cookson dramas and Michel Winterbottom’s 1996 classic, Jude the Obscure.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, from 10.30am-4pm, the church will feature performances by local musicians exhibitions of local crafts, art, photography and history, arts and crafts, activities for children and adults, light lunches and afternoon teas, and guided tours by archaeologist and historian Peter Ryder.</p>

      <p>Plans and models will be on display on how the church could be developed to serve the community better – the next stage of the project.</p>
      <p>The Rev Helen Savage is vicar of the Moorland Group of parishes, including eight churches, and also chairperson of the Blanchland Community Development Organisation.</p>
      <p>“Blanchland is unique and is the jewel of the North Pennines,” she said. “We want people to enjoy it to the full, especially the folk of our own region.</p>
      <p>“There is so much to do and to see here and the abbey can play a huge part in helping it to become truly alive. Beautiful as it is, there’s not much to help you understand the history of the village and the fabulous abbey.</p>
      <p>“It is open every day and is much loved, and we are doing our utmost to make it warm and welcoming and a place that lots more people will find inspiring.”</p>
      <p>The project has attracted around 30 volunteers, most of who are residents of Blanchland, which has a population of 90, and surrounding villages. Its aims include encouraging visitors to stay longer in the village – the church already attracts 40,000 visitors a year.</p>
      <p>The vision also includes tempting artisan workers to live and work in the village and using the church for more activities, including as an education centre.</p>
      <p>“It would help people understand more about our abbey and the very special landscape which is rich in natural and industrial history, and heritage,” said the Rev Savage.</p>
      <p>“Keeping the building open is ever more difficult unless we find more sustainable uses -as is the case for all rural churches – which would also benefit the wider community.</p>
      <p>“Trying to maintain the building with limited resources is quite tricky, but we want to enable people to enjoy the building and what it represents. We want to keep the heart and spirit of Blanchland and not let it gradually ebb away.”</p>
