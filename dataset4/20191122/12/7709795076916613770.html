        <b>Scotland will host Israel in the Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs next March, with a trip to Norway or Serbia waiting in the final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The draw, conducted in Nyon on Friday morning, paired Steve Clarke's side with the nation that finished fifth in Group G, and means a repeat of their Nations League meeting.</p>
      <p>Israel won 2-1 at home with a late Kieran Tierney own goal coming after the Scots had a man sent off, while at Hampden a month later the hosts triumphed 3-2 thanks to a James Forrest hat-trick.</p>
      <p>It was already known that Northern Ireland will travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Republic of Ireland will be away to Slovakia, but the draw confirmed that should they both win, the final would be staged in Belfast.</p>
      <p>Should Scotland qualify for the Euro 2020 finals, they will be in Group D with England, while Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland will be placed in Group E with Spain.</p>
