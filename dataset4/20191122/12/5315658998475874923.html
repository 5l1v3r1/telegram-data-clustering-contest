      <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand Chief Executive Rhys Jones congratulates firefighters from across the country who are growing moustaches for Movember in support of men’s health.</p>
      <p>"Movember is an important cause to raise money and awareness for the health of the important men in our lives," says Rhys Jones.</p>
      <p>"It’s fantastic to see the crews getting involved and supporting such a worthy cause. They are the epitome of Movember’s brave and selfless fundraisers."</p>
      <p>Movember is all about tackling prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide prevention.</p>
      <p>"We recognise the issues raised through Movember are very close to firefighters," says Rhys Jones.</p>
      <p>Responding to emergencies can be both physically and psychologically demanding. Every day firefighters face challenging circumstances to help our communities.</p>
      <p>"We are working to break down the stereotype of a "tough" firefighter who is reluctant to ask for help and are pleased that Movember is encouraging these conversations."</p>
