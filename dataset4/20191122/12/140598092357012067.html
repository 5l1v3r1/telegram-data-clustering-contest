      <p>There are some excellent ready-made crackers available (Peter’s Yard are my particular weakness), but there’s still something special about home-made ones, particularly if you present them with a whole soft cheese, or a good sized chunk of stilton or cheddar. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 25 minutes | <b>Cooking time</b>: 15 minutes</p>
      <h3>MAKES</h3>
      <p>About 36 crackers </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>100g wholemeal flour</li>
        <li>100g plain white flour</li>
        <li>30g rye flour</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>100ml water</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>200g mixed seeds – I use pumpkin, sunflower, sesame and linseed</li>
        <li>3 tbsp poppy seeds (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6. In a large bowl, mix all three flours, the salt, water, olive oil, and most of the mixed seeds (save two tablespoons for scattering over the top). Knead lightly to make a dough. </li>
        <li>Roll out half to a 30 x 30cm square on a piece of non-stick parchment. It will be crumbly – all those seeds – so trim the edges to a neatish square and use the trimmings to patch any cracks. Still on the paper, cut into six long strips, and then across into three, making 18 roughly 5 x 10cm crackers. </li>
        <li>Brush with water and sprinkle with half the reserved seeds and the poppy seeds, if you are using them. Slide the crackers, still on the paper, on to a large baking sheet. Repeat with the other half of the dough. </li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes, turning the baking sheets halfway through, until the crackers are pale gold.</li>
        <li>Slide on to a cooling rack, and once cool break into separate crackers. Store in an airtight container. </li>
      </ol>
