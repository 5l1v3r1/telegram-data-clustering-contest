      <h3>GUNDAM &amp; POKEMON</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purchase <a href="https://displate.com/displate/978840?art=5da591b81c2a8">Gundam The First Print here</a></b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Purchase <a href="https://displate.com/displate/1191822?art=5da591b81c2a8">Kanto Starters Print here</a></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mobile-suit-gundam-series-best-worst/"><i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i></a> print goes back to the beginning with Gundam the First,  a stylized representation of  RX-78-2 Gundam, the first battle mech used by the Earth Federation against the Principality of Zeon. This Gundam would help launch a franchise and inspire everything from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/transformers/"><i>Transformers</i></a> to <i>Pacific Rim</i>.</p>
      <p>And with the recent release of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review/"><i>Pokémon: Sword and Shield</i></a>, everyone is talking about the blockbuster anime we all still can't get enough of, but we wanted to celebrate where most of us started before we move into the future with this amazing print that features Ash and his first starter Pokémon in dynamic silhouettes!</p>
      <h3>COWBOY BEBOP &amp; DRAGONBALL Z</h3>

        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DISPLATE-Cowboy-Bebop-and-Dragonball.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purchase <a href="https://displate.com/displate/744225?art=5da591b81c2a8">See You Space Cowboy Print here</a></b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Purchase <a href="https://displate.com/displate/309020?art=5da591b81c2a8">Beautiful Sunset Print here</a></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're praising the sun with this collection of prints from Displate, as these two anime series each portray their own pitch-perfect version of the sunset/sunrise. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/cowboy-bebop/"><i>Cowboy Bebop</i></a> is one of the more accessible animes for western audiences due to its retro charm that is perfectly captured by this <a href="https://www.cbr.com/cowboy-bebop-john-cho-suffers-production-halting-knee-injury/">Spike</a> tribute.</p>
      <p>Next to <i>Pokémon, </i> one of the most popular animes still being enjoyed today is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dragonball/"><i>Dragonball</i></a>, which has seen quite a few iterations over the years. This stunning sunrise print features the silhouettes of Goku and Gohan as they look out towards their island home as a Dragonball shines in the background.</p>
      <h3>THE BLACK SWORDSMEN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DISPLATE-Black-Swordsmen.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purchase <a href="https://displate.com/displate/552946?art=5da591b81c2a8">The Black Swordsman (Berserk) Print here</a></b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Purchase <a href="https://displate.com/displate/658341?art=5da591b81c2a8">The Black Swordsman (Sword Art Online) Print here</a></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both of these prints celebrate their respective property's "Black Swordsman," though these are two wildly different anime series. The first print is celebrating the opening storyline of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/berserk/"><i>Berserk</i></a>, which introduced fans to Guts as he made his presence known in the fan-favorite series.</p>
      <p>The second version of "The Black Swordsman" comes from the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/sword-art-online/"><i>Sword Art Online</i></a> anime and focuses on the main character Kirito in his leveled up gear from the first game with a silhouette of his love Asuna in her fairy form from the second <i>Alfheim Online</i> game.</p>
