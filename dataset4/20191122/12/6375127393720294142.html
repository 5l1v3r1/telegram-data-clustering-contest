      <h1>Bea not looking for new romance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:04:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>BEA Alonzo looks absolutely stunning at the presscon of her new movie, “Unbreakable”, a title that suits her perfectly as the ghosting she just experienced didn’t break her at all. When asked about this, she says: “Tapos na ako dyan. Naka-move on na ako. I’m okay now and I realized mas marami pang ibang importante sa buhay mo. At hindi kailangang magka-jowa ka ng bago para lang patunayang naka-move on ka na. Mas marami pa ngang dumating na ibang blessings sa buhay ko after what happened. Parang nagka-360 degrees turn sa buhay ko.”</h3>
      <p>She’s not looking for a replacement for Gerald Anderson who now seems to be more open in his relationship with Julia Barrettto.</p>
      <p>“Parang magpapahinga muna ang puso ko. Hindi ko pa kaya. But one thing is sure, pain makes you Unbreakable. Habang buhay ka pa, marami pang trials na ibabato sa’yo ang buhay, so harapin mo lang ang pain, embrace it and the experience will help make you become even more unbreakable.”</p>
      <p>She plays the role of Richard Gutierrez's wife in “Unbreakable”. So how is it working with Richard?</p>
      <p>“I never really thought na magkakaroon ako ng chance to work with him kasi nga, tagakabilang network siya. At the time na nagsimula ang love team namin ni John Lloyd Cruz, sila naman ni Angel Locsin ang magkatambal din. At first, I thought, tahimik siyang tao, so refined, but working with him now, nakakatuwa pala siyang katrabaho. Makuwento rin. It’s so nice kapag kasundo mo 'yung katrabaho mo and I feel lucky dahil aside from this movie, may soap din kami sa Star Creatives, ‘Kahit Minsan Lang’, so matagal pa ang pagsasamahan namin.”</p>
      <p>Although she and Chard play a married couple in “Unbreakable”, its director, Mae Cruz Alviar, says the movie is not really a love story but focuses more on the friendship between Bea as Mariel and Angelica Panganiban as Deena that is tested and goes through lots of ups and downs.</p>
      <p>“The love story is there,” adds Direk Mae. “But life happens and it’s more about the friendship between the two women. Maraming ibang elements of conflict na pumasok to test them. It’s very relatable and very now. This is a serious film of epic proportions as they follow the journey ot two friends and I’m lucky to be working with mga artista na artista talaga. I’ve seen Bea and Angelica grow through the years and I’ve always wished na makagawa sana sila ng movie together. So I pitched this story to them and they liked it right away. It’s an honor working with them, They know their craft. Second nature na sa kanila ang characters nila. As a director, what more can you ask for? In ‘Unbreakable’, they really gave their best.”</p>
      <p>Since their movie is about friendship between two women, how is it working with Angelica? “Si Angelica, intense 'yan bilang kaibigan,” says Bea. “Very sweet, thoughtful pero ipaglalaban ka niya. She’ll treat you like family. Walang kashowbizan as a friend. As friends, parang meron na kaming sariling lengguwahe kaya ang sarap niyang katrabaho, nagkakaintindihan agad kami. Siempre, excited ako to work with her. I watch her movies at napakagaling niya kaya so I’m thrilled to be in this journey of friendship with her.”</p>
