      <h3>48 Hours To Finish Borderlands 3</h3>
      <p>In other words, you’ve got between now and Sunday to beat the game without spending a single dollar. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=65882">Borderlands 3’s main story takes around 20 hours to complete</a>, so you’ve got no excuses.</p>
      <p>Say you start playing a 6 pm today; that gives you more than 48 hours to complete the game. Play Borderlands 3 for 20 hours and sleep for 16 hours, with two hours thrown in for snack and bathroom pit stops. Perfect.</p>
      <p>Take regular breaks, get those legs moving, and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/19/world/taiwan-gamer-death/index.html">make sure you don’t end up like this guy</a>.</p>

      <h3>Only On Console, But PC Deals Are Around The Corner</h3>
      <p>Sadly, the Borderlands 3 free weekend is only available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Console players can pick up for their platform’s respective stores. The event runs until Sunday at 11:59 am PST / 2:59 EST on Xbox, and until Monday at 9:00 am PST / 12 am EST on PlayStation 4.</p>
      <p>PC players can still pick up Borderlands 3 full price via the Epic Game Store, though. Gearbox says there are PC deals on the horizon, so it may be worth holding out for a few days for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>If buying through the Epic Store sends shivers down your spine and you dead set on <a href="https://www.ccn.com/borderlands-3-a-smash-hit-despite-epic-store-controversy/">boycotting the exclusivity deal to the bitter end</a>, then it’s slated to hit Steam next April.</p>
      <p>If you prefer a slow, methodical approach and are up for the 60-hour completionist slog, progress carries over if you buy the game after the free weekend ends.</p>
      <p>To lure you into a full purchase, <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-21-borderlands-3-on-sale-free-to-play-on-consoles-this-weekend/">Gearbox is running a 33% off sale until Dec. 2 on digital PS4 and Xbox One copies of Borderlands 3</a>.</p>
