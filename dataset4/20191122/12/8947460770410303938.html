      <h1>M fans will be able to get the 2021 BMW M3 with manual and RWD</h1>
      <h2>Despite our numerous reports on the design of the 2021 BMW M3/M4 – based on several sources – there was still plenty of skepticism around …</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:26:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Horatiu Boeriu</a></address>
      <p>In our podcast with BMW M CEO Markus Flasch, the new M boss confirmed our previous reports – the upcoming 2021 BMW M3 will be offered with a manual transmission which is only paired with the RWD. This is basically the model that was labeled internally as “Pure.”</p>
      <p>“M3/M4 is the legend. You will still get a rear-wheel drive car and you can get it with a manual,” Flasch said. Recently, the M boss also confirmed the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/06/10/a-closer-look-at-the-future-bmw-m3-m4-engine-the-s58/">S58 engine</a>. “The next BMW M3 will have the brand new S58 engine that we’re launching in the X3 M and X4 M,” he said. “It will have 480bhp in the standard version and 510bhp in the Competition version.”</p>

      <p>In the past, Flasch said that even though the internal name for the manual M3 was “Pure”, that the name was purely a working title. The “Pure” models are rumored to have restyled aprons front and rear, their own wheel design, an optional standalone signature paint job, special fabric and alcantara upholstery, color-coded cabin trim and bespoke instrument graphics.</p>
      <p>The new S58 engine is the same as the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/06/16/first-drive-2020-bmw-x4-m-competition-and-x3-m-competition/">BMW X3 M and X4 M</a>. So it will be a 3.0 liter twin-turbocharged I6 engine with 473 hp as-standard. There will also be a competition model available at launch and that will pack the same engine but with 503 hp. For those keeping score, that 503 hp is exactly the same amount as the Mercedes-AMG C63 S. Still, it’s a bit few ponies less than the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2017/07/25/first-drive-alfa-romeo-giulia-quadrifoglio-italy-at-its-finest/">Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio’s</a> 505 hp.</p>
      <p>This new G80 BMW M3 will also be the first M3 in history to power all four wheels. The all-wheel drive G80 M3 will be automatic only. As for the M3 Competition, it will also only be all-wheel drive and automatic.</p>
      <p>BMW will debut both the G80 M3 and G82 M4 in 2021.</p>
