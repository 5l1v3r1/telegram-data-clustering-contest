      <p>Duke wasn't gone for very long.</p>
      <p>The owner of the five-year-old black goldendoodle says he is back home safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Apparently, it was all just a misunderstanding.</p>

      <p>It's every dog owner's nightmare.</p>
      <p>Friday morning, about 10 a.m, an SUV pulled up to a home on Kelowna's Abbott Street and stole Duke, a black goldendoodle, from the yard.</p>
      <p>“I left for work, I locked the door, and my roommate, whose dog it is, was home upstairs,” Kate Belton said. “When she came downstairs to leave for work, he was nowhere to be found.”</p>
      <p>Their home, near the corner of Abbott and Rose Avenue, has a dog door that five-year-old Duke uses to go out into the fenced yard.</p>
      <p>“They started knocking on neighbours' doors, and one of the neighbours said they saw a blue SUV come and take him,” Belton said. “There were two people in the SUV, and one was a guy, but that's all we know.”</p>
      <p>Belton is hoping someone in the area might have surveillance cameras that captured video of dognapping.</p>
      <p>“He's all black with a white spot on his chin and one on his chest,” Belton said. “He has no collar on, no tattoos and no microchip.”</p>
      <p>Belton has filed a police report, and called local vet clinics and the RDCO dog control line.</p>
      <p>“He is the sweetest boy, and we love him so much. Please help us get him back home.”</p>
      <p>Belton can be reached at 250-300-1426 or by email at kate.l.belton@gmail.com.</p>
