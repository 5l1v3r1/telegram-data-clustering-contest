      <p>The DJ weighed twelve and a half stone in 2017, but changed her lifestyle to shed the pounds.</p>
      <p>After ditching sugar, she lost an incredible 28lbs in 12 months.</p>
      <p>To celebrate she launched a YouTube channel in 2018 called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj74rl5nphH8W--mE4qgg_Q">The Fakeaway Factory</a>, which sees her provide healthy meal alternatives.</p>

      <p>In an Instagram post in 2018, she said: "Past Adele just wanted to wish you a very happy #throwbackthursday.</p>
      <p>"I’ve just told her she’s going to run two marathons in the future. She’s just [bleep] herself laughing and gone straight to the bottom shelf on that cake stand.</p>
      <aside>It’s never too late to change.</aside>
      <p>"It’s never too late to change.</p>
      <p>"Going to take her back to this very spot one day and recreate this photo. Just need to find that bloody t-shirt. It was my favourite. Wore it for Kate’s birthday. Thought I was being dead fancy because it’s got Nike in gold on it.</p>
      <p>"Currently telling the story of how this little cherub went from cake stands to WAKING THE [bleep] UP"</p>

      <p>Earlier on this series, Adele was seen with Roman Kemp eating an assortment of bugs and body parts in a Bushtucker Trial, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/viewers-brand-the-im-a-celebrity-eating-trial-boring-and-say-its-the-same-every-year/">which viewers branded "boring"</a>.</p>
      <p>The infamous trial was a little tamer than usual this year after bosses revealed that contestants <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-stars-will-not-be-fed-live-insects-in-bushtucker-trials/">wouldn't eat live creepy crawlies</a> as it was seen as cruel.</p>
      <p>After they tucked into a cow's teat, vomit fruit, a pig's uterus and a sundae of cockroaches and mealworms, viewers said the segment was "dull".</p>
      <p>And, despite the shake up, one said it was "the same every year".</p>
