      <p>Flight PR113 took off from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) at 11.45 local time but had to make an emergency landing due to a “technical problem” in one of its engines shortly after take-off, <a href="https://www.philippineairlines.com/AboutUs/newsandevents/palstatementonpr113laxmnlflight">according to a statement from Philippine Airlines.</a></p>
      <p>The airline said all 342 passengers and 18 crew members are safe and were able to disembark using regural airstairs.</p>
      <p>“We greatly appreciate the calmness and patience of our PR113 passengers, who cooperated well with our cabin crew during the flight and the emergency landing,” said Philippine Airlines in the statement.</p>
      <p>Andrew Ames watched the incident and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-los-angeles-airplane/philippine-airlines-777-makes-emergency-landing-at-los-angeles-airport-idUSKBN1XV2KY">told Reuters</a>: “It almost looked like backfire flames from a motorcycle or car.”</p>
      <p>It is not immediately clear what the exact cause of the “technical problem” in the engine was.</p>
      <p>GE Aviation, the company which makes the engine for the Boeing 777 said it was aware of the incident and is “working with the airline to determine the cause of the event and to promptly return the aircraft to service,” according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>Boeing is under scrutiny following the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-timeline-history-full-details-2019-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">deadly crashes</a> involving the 737 Max aircraft, which killed a combined 346 people, led to questions over the plane’s design, and left the aircraft grounded across the world.</p>
      <p>Training standards, regulatory oversight and pilot experience have also been called into question following the scandal.</p>
