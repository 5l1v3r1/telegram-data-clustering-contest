      <p>Staff at a supermarket in the town identified the counterfeit notes and contacted West Mercia Police.</p>
      <p>Officers are now working to identify the source of the fake money, but are urging traders and shoppers to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>People are asked to check notes before they accept them and if they believe they have been passed a fake note, keep hold of it and contact the police.</p>
      <p>Bank of England notes include the watermark, metallic thread, raising printing and a holographic foil image.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or <a href="https://crimestoppers-uk.org/">crimestoppers-uk.org</a></p>
