        <b>Most of the historical places in the western province of Herat are on the verge of ruin due to inattention by the government, two local officials said, adding that the budget for renovation of historical sites is insufficient.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Herat has over 800 historical sites, according to local officials, and most of them are in need of care.</p>
      <p>The Friday Mosque, Herat Citadel, Khwajah Abdullah Ansari Shrine, the Gawhar Shad Mausoleum, the minarets of Herat and the Malan bridge are among the famous historical sites in the province.</p>

      <p>“The smallest amount of attention has been paid to Herat’s historical sites—compared to other places in Afghanistan—by the Ministry of Information and Culture,” said Arya Raufian, head of the Information and Culture Directorate in Herat. “Our budget for maintainance of these sites is zero this year.”</p>
      <p>He said his office sent a letter to the Ministry of Information and Culture this year, identifying five historical places that will be ruined if they are not maintained.</p>
      <p>Some of the historical sites are located in the city of Herat, while others are located in Guzara, Ghorian, Chasht and Kohsan districts.</p>

      <p>Herat governor’s spokesman Jailani Farhad said that at least Afs170 million has been allocated to maintain historical places in the province.</p>
      <p>“A survey has been conducted of the historical sites,” he said, “This has been shared with providers of national and international resources. We will try to find more resources to maintain historical sites.”</p>
      <p>But some say a more thorough review of these locations is necessary.</p>
