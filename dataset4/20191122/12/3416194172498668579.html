      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/zayn-malik/"><b>Zayn Malik</b></a> shockingly left <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/one-direction/"><b>One Direction</b></a> in 2015, just a year before the group disbanded on an indefinite hiatus.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/curator/new-music-daily-with-zane-lowe/1458161472?app=music&amp;ign-itsct=cur_zanelowe_newmusicdaily_null&amp;ign-itscg=80034">New Music Daily with Zane Lowe</a> on Apple Music’s Beats 1, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/harry-styles/"><b>Harry Styles</b></a> opened up about the effect of his leaving had on him, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/liam-payne/"><b>Liam Payne</b></a>, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/louis-tomlinson/"><b>Louis Tomlinson</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/niall-horan/"><b>Niall Horan</b></a>.</p>
      <p>“It was kind of like we were sad, obviously, that someone had left, but also sad that he was not enjoying it so much that he had to leave,” <b>Harry </b>shared. “Because I think at the time too, the tour and everything was going so well and everyone had kind of got to this place where everyone was kind of living in a way where they I think felt pretty good. It felt like everyone was kind of enjoying it.”</p>
      <p>He adds, “I’d say a big part of it was us kind of being like, ‘Wow.’ You didn’t realize he wasn’t enjoying it that much.”</p>
      <p>After<b> Zayn</b>‘s departure, the group got even closer after.</p>
      <p>“We were about to start recording a new album and stuff and it was like, ‘Are we recording this without him?’” <b>Harry </b>says. “But I’d say in the moment, I guess the four of us became closer because we were like, ‘OK, this is a hurdle that we weren’t expecting.’”</p>
      <p>The conversations ultimately lead to whether the band would stay together.</p>
      <p>“We’d sit down and have conversations [asking if] everyone [is] good, everyone wants to keep going and that kind of thing,” he adds. “There was a part of me where I felt like all of the decisions I’d made as an adult — that affected my life and what I was doing with my life — had been made as a group. I think there was a part of me that felt like I wanted to make some decisions for myself… I felt like I needed to make some decisions that just affect me.”</p>
      <p>Now, <b>Harry, Louis, Niall</b> and <b>Liam </b>will all be releasing their second and debut albums this winter.</p>
