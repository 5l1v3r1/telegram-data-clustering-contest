      <h2>Former <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> president <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ramon-calderon/"><b>Ramon Calderon</b></a> has tipped new <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> to attempt to bring <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gareth-bale/"><b>Gareth Bale</b></a> back to the English capital.</h2>

      <p>Bale has not turned out for Madrid since the start of October due to a calf injury but was fit enough to represent Wales over the international break.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old was strongly linked with an exit over the summer, with a switch to China mooted as a real possibility.</p>
      <p>Bale ultimately remained with Los Blancos, but the attacker continues to be linked with a move away from the club, and Calderon has claimed that he could be heading back to Tottenham.</p>
      <p>"It's true that Mourinho likes the player," Calderon told <i>BBC Sport</i>. "He said that in 2017 when he tried to sign (him) for Manchester United and Real Madrid decided to extend the contract of Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>"I remember him saying 'if he is by the exit door, I will be waiting on the other side', so maybe it's a solution."</p>
      <p>Bale scored 56 times in 203 appearances for Spurs between 2007 and 2013 before completing a move to the Spanish capital.</p>
