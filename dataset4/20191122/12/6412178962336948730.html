        <b>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has detailed the “problem” he is facing with Mohamed Salah at present.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The German coach confirmed that Salah trained at Melwood on Thursday, but refused to commit himself to whether or not the Egypt star would be fit to face Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mohamed-salah">Salah</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/andrew-robertson">Andrew Robertson</a></b> were both deemed unable to compete (via <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11865719/mohamed-salah-and-andrew-robertson-set-to-miss-liverpools-trip-to-crystal-palace?fbclid=IwAR2tx4KYNCM1fa9VsPcfbE1JVkmO3yHj0HcVU6AL7sEnl8S1Z43qqqcYk_w"><i>Sky Sports</i></a>) on Thursday, with a period of rest during the recent international break not proving long enough for their respective injuries to heal.</p>
      <p>Salah has an ankle problem that he picked up in a challenge with Hamza Choudry in the win against Leicester, while Robertson also has an ankle problem that is likely to see him sit out at Selhurst Park</p>
      <p>Klopp said: “Yesterday he trained. He has been training the things we want him to do. It’s not that he has got worse, it’s just that it is there still (injury), so that is the problem. We have to be sensible. I have to see the session today before I make a decision.”<br/>Klopp also gave Virgil Van Dijk the all clear to face Palace after the centre-back pulled out of international duty to a personal issues last weekend.<br/>“Virgil is 100% available. I cannot say 100% for the others (Salah, Robertson, Matip). Fabinho, Bobby, Alisson, Gini (Wijnaldum) all played on Tuesday. We will see how they react. Nobody came back injured,” said Klopp.</p>
      <p>“But it’s the time of year when players go out of the squad overnight with other things, like feeling sick. I cannot say 100% on the others. I don’t know. Today very important session especially with players who were back late.”</p>

      <p>Klopp was also asked about sports psychologist Lee Richardson.</p>
      <p>Richardson, a psychologist who was also a professional footballer and a former manager of Chesterfield, arrived in July and has now been brought in to consult with the squad.</p>
      <p>Klopp added: “I think 20 or 25 years ago there were no keeper coaches, teams around the team get bigger. It’s a job to do but I am not involved. It’s confidential what he is doing with the boys.</p>
      <p>“It’s just an add-on for the things we try to deliver. We try to make sure the boys are in the best hands. Lee is a fantastic person so I don’t have to convince the boys to talk to him.”</p>
