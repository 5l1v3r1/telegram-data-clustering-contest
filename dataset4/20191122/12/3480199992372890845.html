      <p>A Hong Kong court has suspended its decision to dismiss a government ban on wearing face masks at protests, allowing police to enforce the decree for another week around keenly contested local elections.</p>
      <p>The court had ruled on Monday that the ban, imposed in October under rarely used emergency powers to prevent anti-government protesters from hiding their identity, infringed on fundamental rights more than was reasonably necessary.</p>
      <p>The government had appealed for a freeze on the ruling while it appeals to higher courts.</p>
      <p>The High Court agreed on Friday to grant a one-week suspension in view of the “highly exceptional circumstances that Hong Kong is currently facing”, local broadcaster RTHK reported.</p>

      <p>Many Hong Kong protesters have defied the ban, and during lunchtime rallies on Friday some chanted: “We have the right to wear masks.”</p>
      <p>The city’s new police commissioner, Tang Ping-keung, told reporters officers would be out in force at polling stations on Sunday to respond to any outbreak of violence “without hesitation”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile six masked protesters surrendered before dawn on Friday at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which was taken over by demonstrators last week.</p>
      <p>The group emerged from a campus entrance and held hands as they walked towards a checkpoint. Five wore the black clothing favoured by the protest movement.</p>
      <p>Most of the protesters who took over the campus have now left, but an unknown number have remained inside.</p>

      <p>Tang Chun-Keung, head of the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools, said some of those who remain in the campus are minors who, he said, are “emotionally unstable”.</p>
      <p>Police have said those under 18 can leave, although they may face charges later, and pledged impartial treatment for all adults facing arrest.</p>
      <p>Protesters involved in the months-long action across Hong Kong are demanding fully democratic elections and an investigation into alleged police brutality in suppressing the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>City leaders have said they want to go ahead with the vote due on Sunday, which is being seen as a bellwether of public support for the protests, but warned violence could make it impossible to hold a fair and safe election.</p>
      <p>Asked if the police presence would make voters feel uncomfortable, police chief Mr Tang insisted it will make citizens “feel safe to go out and vote”.</p>
