      </p>
      <p>So. Farewell, then, Siddiq.</p>
      <p>Avi Nash’s time on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-walking-dead/">The Walking Dead</a> (as a living character, anyway) came to an end in this week’s dramatic season 10 episode Open Your Eyes.</p>
      <p>The actor play(ed) Alexandria doctor Siddiq on the show, with the character given a rather painful arc this season relating to the severe PTSD he suffered after witnessing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/25/walking-dead-producer-explains-decision-behind-brutal-season-9-episode-15-deaths-9000691/">the Whisperers’ mass murder of a number of his friends in season nine.</a></p>
      <p>Siddiq’s death came just as he’d finally figured out <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/walking-dead-season-10-fan-theory-reckons-siddiq-beheaded-victims-alphas-massacre-10978047/">who the Whisperers’ mole in Alexandria was, too: his fellow doctor Dante.</a></p>

      <p>The evil physician couldn’t let Siddiq stop him from doing Alpha’s dirty work, though, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/the-walking-dead-season-10-episode-7-questions-we-have-after-shock-death-and-unbelievable-whisperers-twist-11164672/">and so he proceeded to rub out Siddiq once and for all.</a></p>

      <p>Due to the show filming out of sequence this season, Siddiq’s death scene wasn’t actually Nash’s final bit of work on the show.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/17/walking-dead-siddiq-avi-nash-open-your-eyes/">EW</a>, Nash revealed that a wholesome scene he filmed with Christian Serratos (who plays Rosita, the mother of Siddiq’s daughter) was actually his last action on The Walking Dead.</p>
      <p>‘Well, some of the tears were saved thanks to shooting out of order this year — it’s kind of funny to die and then come back the following week and shoot daddy daycare scenes with your baby strapped to your chest,’ Nash said.</p>
      <p>‘But when we finally got to my last scene on my last day — it was the one where Siddiq and Rosita sit in bed — I was just about ready to lose it.’</p>

      <p>Nash said it ‘sort of took everything I had to keep from breaking down’, and he was ‘so thankful’ that Serratos was there to ‘keep me from losing my s**t.’</p>
      <p>‘I remember just wishing [director Michael Cudlitz] would keep calling for a different shot, or more coverage, or another take… anything to keep it from ending,” Nash added, saying it was ‘really emotional’ to finally wrap his scenes.</p>
      <p>‘This cast and crew have become my close friends and my family over these past three years — they gave my gypsy heart a place to call home and it has been really tough to say goodbye.’</p>
