      <h1>'Don't expect another 4-0 because Bradford are a good team!' Ryan Lowe on Plymouth Argyle's return to Home Park action</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims have not had a home league game since they beat Leyton Orient 4-0 on October 22</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:34:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Lowe has challenged his Plymouth Argyle players to put in the performances that will see them continue their good form at Home Park this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> have won four four, drawn three and lost only one of their eight League Two games at the Theatre of Greens.</p>
      <p>Gary Bowyer’s third-placed Bradford City will provided the opposition at Home Park tomorrow.</p>
      <p>It is the first time that Argyle will have played a league game in front of their own fans since they beat Leyton Orient 4-0 on October 22.</p>
      <p>Manager Ryan Lowe said with a laugh: “Don’t expect another 4-0 because Bradford are a good team!”</p>
      <p>Argyle are coming off back-to-back 1-0 away wins against Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round and Forest Green Rovers in the league.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It’s always nice when you are playing at Home Park. The fans have been with us through thick and thin, away from home as well.</p>
      <p>“They have travelled all them distances. I know Forest Green wasn’t too far for them.</p>
      <p>“It will be nice to get back but we know we have got to put performances on. We have lost one all season at home in the league and we want to try and continue that form.</p>
      <p>“But, look, we are under no illusions. It’s going to be a tough ask because Bradford are a good team.</p>
      <p>“If we do what we do, play the way we play, and have the resilience, power and strength we have had of late, then I would like to fancy us.”</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims’ clean sheet victories over Bolton and Forest Green have both been hard-earned.</p>

      <p>Lowe said: It’s the work paying off on the training pitch. We have said all along we are a work in progress.</p>
      <p>“It’s lads buying into our philosophy and my style of play, and what I expect from them.</p>
      <p>“A lot of lads have played different formations and played different styles of football, but what I am seeing is the resilience of the boys.</p>
      <p>“If they are in the team they want to stay in the team, they want to fight for every ball – headers, kicks, whatever it is.</p>
      <p>“But ultimately we want to play our football, and to play your football you have to do all those bits and they have been certainly doing that.”</p>
      <p>Argyle have lost only one of their last seven league games – the 4-0 Devon Derby defeat at Exeter City.</p>
      <p>When it was suggested to Lowe that the result against Exeter was a blip, he had an interesting take on that.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s not a blip is it? We just got beat. People are saying to me ‘Have you turned the corner?’</p>
      <p>“Well, what corner? We hadn’t lost six on the bounce and then won two or three on the bounce. It has not been the case.</p>
      <p>“We have been in good form. We have lost one in seven, which is very good.</p>
      <p>“The expectations were people probably thought we could go and win every game. Well, you can’t because it’s not as easy as that.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there is any blip. I just think you are not going to win every game.</p>
      <p>“There is going to be times when we have played teams off the park but just can’t win. There is going to be times when we haven’t played as well as we could, but win.</p>
      <p>“There is going to be times when it’s just a nothing game and it’s 0-0.</p>
      <p>“Look, all we are trying to do is be the best we can be every week,” added the Pilgrims’ boss.</p>
      <p>Bradford were one of the teams relegated from League One along with Argyle last season.</p>
      <p>They finished bottom of the table, but Bowyer has done an excellent job in revitalising the Bantams this term.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “The expectations of Bradford of where they have got to be, or where they should be, is certainly where they are now and keep climbing.</p>
      <p>“We know it’s a tough ask, but that’s what you want. You want to come up against tough opposition.</p>
      <p>“Gary Bowyer is a great bloke and he has got some good players. They will play a little bit of football but they can hustle and bustle as well, and they can get it back to front.</p>
      <p>“We have got our intentions of what we will be trying to do to Bradford.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, we will keep that in-house because we don’t want anyone to know. Gaz will have the same.</p>
      <p>“He will be coming here not just to pick a point up, he’s coming here to win, the same as we are. It should be an entertaining game.”</p>
      <p>Lowe played down any talk that it would be a battle of wits between him and Bowyer as managers on the touchline.</p>

      <p>He said: “There is no battle between me and Gaz. We are good friends, a good relationship.</p>
      <p>“I have got the utmost respect for Gaz. I never have battles with managers.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about me. It’s about the team. All we do is do our work through the week to help the boys get the three points.</p>
      <p>“As far as a battle between managers, I don’t buy into all that. It’s nothing about me or Gaz, it’s just about two teams locking horns for three points.”</p>
