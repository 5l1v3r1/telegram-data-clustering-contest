      <h2>George Powell and Layton Davies were sentenced by Judge Nicholas Cartwright at Worcester Crown Court for stealing a viking treasure hoard which dates back 1,100 years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:43:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A pair of metal detectorists who found and tried to keep Viking treasure worth £3million have been jailed for a collective 18 and a half a years.</p>
      <p>George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, found the trove, which experts believe was buried more than 1,100 years ago.</p>
      <p>It included a 9th-century gold ring, a dragon’s head bracelet and up to 300 coins with inscriptions from Saxon-Viking times.</p>
      <p>The coins included “two emperors” featuring the faces of King Alfred the Great and King Ceolwulf II, last king of Mercia, worth up to £50,000 each.</p>
      <p>By law they should have reported the discovery on a farm in Leominster, Herefordshire, but instead they tried to hide its true nature so they could make a fortune on the black market.</p>
      <p>They decided to sell the coins instead.</p>

      <p>Only 31 of the coins and a few pieces of the jewellery have ever been recovered, and the hunt for the rest of the loot continues.</p>
      <p>The recovered items are estimated to be worth around £3m, and the total hoard could have been as much as £12m.</p>
      <p>Mobile phone photographs - later deleted, but recovered by police - showed the larger hoard, still intact, in a freshly dug hole.</p>
      <p>Expert analysis of all the jewellery and coinage recovered to date and now held at the British Museum, returned a valuation of at least £581,000.</p>

      <p>Coin sellers Simon Wicks and Paul Wells were also convicted on the concealment charge after Powell and Davies contacted them in order to sell the treasure.</p>
      <p>Wells told the court he knew the coins should be declared, but was himself found to have hidden five in a magnifying glass handle.</p>
      <p>Under UK law all treasure found belongs to the state, which then decides via the Crown and a Treasure Valuation Committee<b> </b>how it should be shared between the landowner or tenant and the finder.</p>
      <p>Powell only handed three coins he found to the owner of the farm and those were “not particularly valuable”, Worcester crown court heard.</p>

      <p>Powell of Newport, South Wales, and Davies of Pontypridd denied theft but were found guilty.</p>
      <p>Sentencing on Friday, Judge Nicholas Cartwright said the men had "cheated" not only the landowner, but also the public of "exceptionally rare and significant" coins.</p>
      <p>He said: "You cheated the farmer, his mother, the land-owner and also the public when you committed theft of these items.</p>

      <p>"That is because the treasure belongs to the nation.</p>
      <p>"The benefit to the nation is these items can be seen and admired by others."</p>
      <p>Powell was jailed for 10 years while Davies was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Wicks, 56, was jailed for five years while Wells, 60 - who became unwell during Thursday's hearing - will be sentenced on 23 December.</p>
      <p>Lesley Milner of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “This find had immense historical value and should have been disclosed to the authorities.”</p>
