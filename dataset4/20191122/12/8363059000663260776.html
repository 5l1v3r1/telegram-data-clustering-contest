      <p>Last month saw London's Westfield shopping centre play host to the UK's first Pokémon Center to tie into the launch of the UK-centric <i>Sword and Shield</i> games. While the shop was a pop-up, and only open for a month, it turned out to be a huge success <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/10/25/londons-pokemon-center-is-mobbed-with-no-tents-allowed">with people queueing all day and night </a>for the chance to get in and grab some exclusive merch. And today the Pokémon Company has announced it's coming back.</p>
      <p>Details are a little bit sketchy right now, but Pokémon Company has confirmed that there will be a Pokémon Center on-site during the 2020 Pokémon World Championships. For those that don't know, it's the official tournament for all Pokémon players, be they video gamers or fans of the card game.</p>
      <p>The location for the tournament is still to be announced, but this news means anyone who wasn't able to queue for nine hours only to find they'd run out of bowler hat-wearing Pikachus has another chance to buy some cool Pokémon things.</p>
