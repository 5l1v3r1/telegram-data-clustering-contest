        <b>Steven Gerrard has vowed to hand Glen Kamara an improved contract so long as the Rangers midfielder continues to shine.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The £50,000 bargain buy from Dundee has been a major hit at Ibrox since arriving last January.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old Finland international has been attracting interest from south of the border, with Leeds the most recent English side to be credited with an interest in the £8 million-rated star.</p>
      <p>Kamara's current deal runs to the summer of 2023 but reports have suggested Gers chiefs were preparing to open talks on fresh terms to ward off potential suitors.</p>
      <p>Gerrard did not confirm if those moves were imminent but reassured Kamara that he will be rewarded if he maintains his recent displays.</p>
      <p>"We haven't heard of any interest down south, we've read tons about it though," said Gerrard. "But I wouldn't be surprised if there was interest in Glen Kamara because he's an outstanding footballer.</p>
      <p>"He's been outstanding since he walked in the door. Sometimes I still have to pinch myself for how we got him and what we got him for.</p>
      <p>"Glen is doing fine. He got a real strong contract when he came here from Dundee.</p>
      <p>"He's in good form and playing well. The message for Glen and the other players is we always reward our players for consistent performances over a long period of time. Glen will be treated no different.</p>
      <p>"All he needs to worry about is bringing success back to the club and I'm sure he will be well looked after."</p>
      <p>Kamara has rejoined his Gers team-mates ahead of Sunday's trip to Hamilton, fresh from helping Finland book their first ever appearance at a major tournament.</p>
