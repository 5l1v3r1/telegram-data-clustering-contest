      <p>Brian May has said Sir Paul McCartney called him about “the mass killing of badgers” ahead of announcing his Glastonbury performance.</p>
      <p>The Beatles star is set to play the festival at Worthy Farm, and apparently checked in with the Queen guitarist regarding animal welfare.</p>
      <p>May previously said he would not play Glastonbury after clashing with organiser Michael Eavis over the badger cull.</p>

      <p>The rock star said Sir Paul called him about the cull before accepting the festival gig.</p>
      <p>He wrote on Instagram: “Paul was kind enough to phone me about this before he accepted the invitation.</p>
      <p>“He was concerned that he might be thought to be endorsing the current mass killing of badgers.</p>
      <p>“Paul, a great campaigner on behalf of animals, is firmly against the Badger Cull.</p>
      <p>“I told him he should not feel any obligations – that my reluctance to play was based on the personal comments Michael Eavis has made about me.”</p>

      <p>May was termed a “danger to farming” by the festival founder due to his opposition to culling badgers.</p>
      <p>Eavis’s support for the cull has prompted calls from some to boycott the festival at Worthy Farm.</p>
      <p>May claims that the farmer and rock concert organiser “frequently insulted” him so he would not take part in the show, although he wished Sir Paul luck with the performance.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “I work daily with people who disagree with me in matters like this – it’s necessary in order to move forward.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t have to work with people who insult me who are ignorant of the work I do.</p>
      <p>“People can change, and I’m always open to that. In the meantime I wish Paul and his band a great gig.”</p>
      <p>May previously said badger culling is a “tragedy and unnecessary crime against wildlife”.</p>
      <p>The animals are culled in an attempt to reduce the spread of bovine tuberculosis.</p>
