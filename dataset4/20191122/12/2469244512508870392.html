      <p>"River levels will remain high and flooding to low lying land and roads is likely.</p>
      <p>"Further rain is forecast during the rest of Friday and overnight. This will cause river levels to rise again with further flooding expected in the area.</p>
      <p>"We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the area checking for and clearing blockages. This message will be updated on Saturday morning or earlier if the situation changes.</p>
      <p>"Take care near the areas of concern and monitor your local weather conditions."</p>
