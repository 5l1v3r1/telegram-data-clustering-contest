      <p>In rural Tajikistan, families are deprived of fathers and husbands who spend years working in Russia to provide for the impoverished communities they leave behind.

      <p>Protests erupted in dozens of towns and cities across Iran after an announcement that gasoline prices would be dramatically increased.
