      <h1>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer laughs off Nemanja Matic’s Instagram activity</h1>
      <h2>Matic liked an Instagram post this week which suggested he could join forces with Mourinho</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:56:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Critchley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has laughed off <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Nemanja_Matic">Nemanja Matic’s</a> recent social media activity despite speculation linking the midfielder with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, <i>The Independent</i> reported that Mourinho had mentioned Matic in talks with Daniel Levy ahead of accepting the Tottenham Hotspur job.</p>
      <p>The Serbian, who has only made five appearances under Solskjaer this season, left Chelsea to reunite with Mourinho at Old Trafford in 2017.</p>
      <p>Matic liked an Instagram post this week which suggested he could join forces with Mourinho once again in north London.</p>
      <p>And though Solskjaer has previously told his players to be “boring” on social media, he took Matic’s activity in good humour. </p>
      <p>“That’s not a part of being boring,” he said. “When it’s like this, you like Jose coming back, it’s going to be a spectacle and a circus. Nemanja has a sense of humour.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s position at United has come under greater speculation following Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham dismissal earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was United’s first-choice to replace Mourinho at Old Trafford last year until Solskjaer’s excellent caretaker spell.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer insisted on Friday that he has no concerns over Pochettino’s availability, though concedes that any manager would want to be in charge of United.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t bother me at all because I’ve got the best job in the world,” he said. “I’m sure that if you’re in or out of a job and you are a manager, you would want this job, so it doesn’t really matter whatever happens around it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to focus on my job at Man Utd, do it as well as we can, I speak with Ed and the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward and that doesn’t change if some other clubs change their managers.”</p>
