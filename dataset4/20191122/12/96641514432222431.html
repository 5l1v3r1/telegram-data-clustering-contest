      <p>Dell's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/dell/ultrasharp/u2711/scores/">UltraSharp 27 Monitor</a> is one of our top monitor recommendations, and it's easily one of the best monitors in its price range. The 27-inch monitor has great color accuracy, deep blacks, very wide angle views and a 2560 x 1440 resolution. When we first reviewed it, it was priced around $800.

      <p>Dell is also discounting a couple monitors from its boutique gaming brand Alienware.

The 25-inch, 1080-pixel display has a speedy 240Hz refresh rate, fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync technology, which reduces image tearing and choppiness. Usually priced at $500, the monitor is currently on sale for <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/mpp/productdetail/3gwc">$280</a>, a $220 discount.</p>

      <p>Dell/LG</p>
      <p>The LG B9 OLED (in both 65- and 55-inch versions) is on sale, as well, and it's bundled with a free 4K UHD Blu-ray player. While it's not a huge discount on the TV itself, this is one of the best TVs in terms of price and performance, and the Blu-ray add-on makes this a great deal.</p>
      <p>Plus, earlier this month, through a firmware update, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/nvidia-g-sync-lg-oled/">LG pushed NVIDIA's G-Sync to both models</a>. This should make games look smoother, reduce response times and reduce flicker, tearing and stuttering when playing PC games.</p>
      <p>The 65-inch B9 OLED is on sale for <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/accessories/apd/aa821727">$1,799</a>, and the 55-inch B9 OLED is discounted at <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/accessories/apd/aa821804">$1,199</a>.</p>
