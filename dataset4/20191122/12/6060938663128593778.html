      <p>It was in the 2001 Test series against Australia, that Harbhajan became the first Indian cricketer to take a hat-trick in the longest format of the game. He achieved the feat in front of a jam-packed stadium at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Before the start of the pink-ball match, Bangladesh Prime Minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sheikh-hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a>, West Bengal chief minister Mamta Banerjee and Tendulkar greeted India and Bangladesh players.</p>
      <p>In the ongoing Test, Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat first.</p>
