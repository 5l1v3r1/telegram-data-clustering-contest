      <h1>Bergamot and bay gin recipe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/xanthe-clay/" target="_blank">Xanthe Clay</a></address>
      <p>Flavouring your own gin is easy and, done right, delicious. Kate Hawkings, the drinks expert and author of Aperitif (<a href="https://books.telegraph.co.uk/Product/Kate-Hawkings/Aperitif--A-spirited-guide-to-the-drinks-history-and-cult/21749392">Quadrille, £16.99</a>) suggested this combination – she uses Beefeater gin but any fairly mild one will do.</p>
      <p>Bergamots, the aromatic citrus that gives Earl Grey tea its perfumed flavour, are occasionally available at this time of year from greengrocers. Natoora is selling them via <a href="https://www.ocado.com/browse?filters=natoora-33871">Ocado</a> and <a href="https://www.abelandcole.co.uk/lemons-bergamot">Abel &amp; Cole</a> stocks them too. Failing that, use grapefruit and a strip of orange (ideally Seville orange if you find an early one) instead.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 15 minutes, plus 1 week macerating</p>
      <h3>MAKES</h3>
      <p>One 75ml bottle</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 bergamot, or a small grapefruit, and an orange, ideally Seville</li>
        <li>1 x 75ml bottle of gin</li>
        <li>2 fresh bay leaves</li>
        <li>Sugar syrup, to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <p>METHOD</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Scrub the fruit and peel off the zest in strips using a potato peeler (you’ll only need one strip from the orange). Slice off any white pith that is still attached to the zest, before putting it in a bottle with the gin and the bay leaves. Replace the cap and leave for a week or so before tasting to see if it’s ready – it might need longer maceration.</li>
        <li>When the flavour suits you, decant the gin out of the bottle and into a fresh bottle, leaving behind the zest and bay leaves. Taste it and add sugar syrup if you like.</li>
      </ol>
