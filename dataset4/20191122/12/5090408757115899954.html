        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/henry-cavill">Henry Cavill</a> said he missed out on playing <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/james-bond">James Bond</a> because a director told him he was too “chubby” for the role.</li>
        <li>The “Casino Royale” audition required him to walk out with nothing but a towel on.</li>
        <li>“I remember the director, Martin Campbell, saying, ‘Looking a little chubby there, Henry,'” Cavill said in an interview with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">Men’s Health.</a></li>
        <li>But the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/man-of-steel">“Man of Steel”</a> star said his set-back was a wake-up call that he needed to change his diet and physical health.</li>
        <li>“I didn’t know how to train or diet. And I’m glad Martin said something, because I respond well to truth. It helps me get better.”</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/henry-cavill">Henry Cavill</a> revealed he once auditioned for <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/james-bond">James Bond,</a> but a director told him he was too “chubby” for the role.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/man-of-steel">“The Man of Steel”</a> star said part of his audition process for “Casino Royale” involved walking out of a bathroom with nothing but a towel on.</p>
      <p>“I remember the director, Martin Campbell, saying, ‘Looking a little chubby there, Henry,'” Cavill said in an interview with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">Men’s Health.</a></p>

        <figcaption>According to Henry Cavill, the “Casino Royale” director, Martin Campbell, said he was “looking a little chubby.”<cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIptAITLjbA">Warner Bros</a></cite></figcaption>

      <p>But acknowledging he had a poor diet at the time, Cavill, who said he was called “Fat Cavill” and was teased for his weight as a child, said the director’s dismissal was a wake-up that made him rethink his physical health.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to train or diet,” he told Men’s Health. “And I’m glad Martin said something, because I respond well to truth. It helps me get better.”</p>
      <p>Prior to his James Bond audition, Cavil had parts in “Midsomer Murders” and 2002’s “The Count of Monte Cristo.” He was just 23 when he lost out to <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/daniel-craig">Daniel Craig</a> as 007.</p>

      <p>Cavill said he also missed out on major parts in <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/twilight">“Twilight”</a> and “Tristan + Isolde.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until he got the lead in the 2011 fantasy film, “Immortals,” that his stardom rose.</p>
      <p>But the role of a lifetime didn’t come without discomfort – Cavill said he had to follow a rigourous diet for six months before filming.</p>
      <p>“It was my first experience working on a movie and having my shirt off for most of the damn time … It’s very emotionally taxing,” he told the magazine. “When you add the lack of food and pressure on top of that, it’s rough.”</p>
      <p>The equally buff roles continued when Cavill scored the role of <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/superman">Superman</a> in “Man of Steel.”</p>
      <p>His next major release sees him star as Geralt in the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/netflix">Netflix</a> adaptation of the hugely popular game, <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-witcher">“The Witcher,”</a> which premieres in December.</p>
