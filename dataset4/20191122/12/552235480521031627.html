      <h1>East Kilbride pupils brew up funds to help hospice continue vital work</h1>
      <h2>Auldhouse Primary held a coffee morning in aid of Kilbryde Hospice with family members invited along for a cuppa and some tasty home baking.</h2>

      <p>Pupils from Auldhouse Primary in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> have been doing their bit to raise funds for a local charity.</p>
      <p>Kids at the school held a coffee morning earlier this month in aid of Kilbryde Hospice.</p>
      <p>Pupils from the small rural school sent out letters inviting family members to attend and baked cakes and goodies themselves.</p>

      <p>These were then sold at the event to help raise funds for the local hospice. Pupils also raised funds by selling unwanted books and toys they themselves had donated.</p>

      <p>And their efforts bore fruit, with family and friends of the school helping to raise £203.94 for Kilbryde.</p>
      <p>Kilbryde Hospice opened its inpatient unit last August and depends on donations to be able to deliver their services.</p>
      <p>It costs £2.5 million a year to run, which equates to £7000 per day. Events like the fundraiser are therefore vital to helping the charity continue its efforts.</p>

      <p>Acting head teacher Heather McVey was pleased to host the event at the amount raised.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s been really rewarding working with the children for this.</p>
      <p>“They’ve prepared for this event and we are very thankful to all the families who have supported the fundraiser by baking or attending the event.”</p>
      <p>Robyn Hastings, P1-3 teacher at the school, helped arrange the event after members of the charity visited and spoke with pupils during health week in October.</p>
      <p>There, pupils were told about the important work of the hospice.</p>

      <p>Robyn said: “The children are always keen to find new ways that they can get involved in their community to help benefit other people.</p>
      <p>“Holding the coffee morning was a great opportunity for the pupils to demonstrate their organisational skills, their compassion and have fun with their families at the school to help benefit Kilbryde Hospice.</p>
      <p>“‘Hope,’ the Kilbryde Hospice mascot, has visited the school on several occasions now building up a rapport with the children. They now easily recognise the hospice colours and logo and used these colours to theme the event.</p>
      <p>“Pupils from Tiree House organised the event and the children from primary one all the way to primary seven have been getting involved and showed their support by baking for the event and donating unwanted books and toys for the toy stall.</p>
      <p>“It’s important for the children to understand the work of the hospice and how vital it is to support local causes like this one.”</p>

      <p>Holly Sheen, community fundraiser from Kilbryde, gave a short presentation on the work of the hospice and the necessity for fundraising events like the coffee morning.</p>
      <p>More than just a fundraiser though, the event was a vital community event, providing a great chance to catch up.</p>
      <p>Entertainment was provided on the day by pupils, with some singing from the school choir.</p>
