      <h1>Real Yield On 10-Year TIPS Reopening Drops To 0.149%, Lowest In 3 Years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:31:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Tipswatch</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Treasury market isn't attractive right now for small scale investors.</li>
        <li>A real yield of 0.149% was the lowest for any 9- to 10-year TIPS since an auction in September 2016 generated a real yield of 0.052%.</li>
        <li>The inflation break-even rate came in at 1.62%, low by historical standards but not out of line with recent results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The U.S. Treasury's auction of $12 billion in a reopened 10-year TIPS generated a real yield to maturity of 0.149%, the lowest for any auction of this maturity since September 2016.</p>
      <p>This is CUSIP 9128287D6, a 10-year TIPS that had an originating auction on July 18, 2019. It carries a coupon rate of 0.250%, based on the real yield to maturity at that July 18 auction, which came in at 0.282%.</p>
      <p>A TIPS is a Treasury investment that pays a coupon rate well below that of other Treasury investments of the same term. But with a TIPS, the principal balance adjusts each month (usually up, but sometimes down) to match the current U.S. inflation rate. So the "real yield to maturity" of a TIPS indicates how much an investor will earn above inflation.</p>
      <p>At a reopening auction, the auctioned real yield to maturity is compared to the coupon rate to determine the price investors will pay... above or below par.</p>
      <p>Because the real yield of Thursday's auction came in under the coupon rate of 0.250%, the result is that investors paid a premium over par value for the resulting 9-year, 8-month TIPS. The price was about $101.34 for about $100.37 of par value, after accrued inflation is added in. This TIPS will have an inflation index of 1.00372 on the settlement date of November 29.</p>
      <p>It's remarkable to see the 10-year real yield dip as low as 0.149%, just a year after a similar auction generated a real yield of 1.109%. That's a drop of 96 basis points, spurred by Federal Reserve actions to lower short-term interest rates, plus investors' increasingly negative view of the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>Here is the trend in the 10-year real yield over the last 10 years, showing the deep dive after the Federal Reserve began an aggressive bond-buying program in mid 2011:</p>

      <p>So today's real yield of 0.149% isn't an outlier compared with results over the last 10 years, but it does reflect a flight to safety as global economies weaken. Could this downward trend continue? Definitely, if the U.S. economy shows any signs of weakness.</p>
      <p>But my strong feeling is that the U.S. Treasury market - both nominals and TIPS - isn't attractive right now for small scale investors. Yields are too low versus historical standards. Look elsewhere to invest for safety... Possibly U.S. Series I Savings Bonds or insured bank CDs.</p>

          <b>Inflation break-even rate</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>With a 10-year nominal Treasury trading today with a yield of 1.77%, this reopened TIPS gets an inflation break-even rate of 1.62%, meaning it will outperform a Treasury if inflation averages 1.63% or higher over the next 9 years, 8 months. That number is low by historical standards but also isn't an outlier compared to results of recent TIPS auctions. A reopening of this same TIPS on September 19 generated an inflation break-even rate slightly lower, at 1.60%.</p>
      <p>Even with U.S. inflation currently running at 1.8%, investors in nominal Treasurys are gambling that inflation will dip even lower over the next 10 years. If they believed inflation will be higher, the inflation break-even rate would be higher. Here is the trend in the 10-year inflation break-even rate over the last 10 years. Note how often this rate rose above 2.0%, even as recently as 2018:</p>

      <p>The lower the inflation break-even rate goes, the more attractive a TIPS is versus a nominal Treasury. So at this point, while low real yields make TIPS an unattractive investment, they are certainly more attractive than a nominal Treasury of the same term.</p>
      <p>Here are results from all the 9- to 10-year TIPS auctions since 2016, showing that the inflation break-even rate has been steadily drifting lower, reflecting the belief by many investors that inflation may not be dead, but it is certainly under control.</p>

      <p>Under these circumstances, even a TIPS with a lousy real yield of 0.149% could be viewed as a decent value for big money investors.</p>
