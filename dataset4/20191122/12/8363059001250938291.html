      <p>BT Sport Ultimate, formerly known as the BT Sport 4K UHD channel, is bringing live matches to you in 4K HDR for the first time in Europe.</p>
      <p>The channel always seems to be announcing sports-related 4K UHD HDR blah blah updates, with the last one being the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/bt-sport-will-be-live-broadcasting-football-in-hdr/">live broadcasting of the footie in HDR back in August</a>. This week's <a href="https://sport.bt.com/news/watch-bt-sport-ultimate-on-more-devices-than-ever-before-S11364412400952">announcement</a> sees the channel making its "biggest live matches" available in 4K and HDR on more devices as of today, including Samsung smart TVs, Xbox One consoles, and Chromecast Ultra streaming devices.</p>
      <p>That's good news for those of you hotly anticipating upcoming events like the UEFA Champions League matches featuring Tottenham Hotspur v Olympiacos on Tuesday, November 26 at 8pm, and Liverpool v Napoli on Wednesday, November 27 at 8pm.</p>
      <p>If you're an existing Sky customer with BT Sport, or have a subscription to the BT Sportâ€™s app, you can add BT Sport Ultimate to your package for an extra fiver a month. The channel plans to broadcast up to 70 live events in HDR this season, including the UEFA Champions League, Premier League, and whatever else involves a bunch of grown men fannying about in matching outfits on a big bit of grass.</p>
