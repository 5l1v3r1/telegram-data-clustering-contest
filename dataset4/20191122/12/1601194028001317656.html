      <p>One of the most well-known incidents where a WWE Superstar went off-script came in May 2018 when CazXL (fka <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/big-cass">Big Cass</a>) threw a barrage of punches at a little person dressed as Daniel Bryan on SmackDown Live.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chris Jericho on <a href="http://www.westwoodonepodcasts.com/pods/talk-is-jericho">Talk Is Jericho</a>, Cass explained that he was only supposed to hit the actor with a big boot, which was designed to get him “mega heat”, but he took it upon himself to go one step further when he noticed that sections of the audience were laughing instead of booing.</p>
      <blockquote>“This was specifically designed to get me uber, uber heat. Then I was panicking because I was like, ‘This is not the reaction they want.’ So then I did what I thought was right, I got back through the curtain, it was very, very bad. It was a bad night for me.”</blockquote>
      <p>When Jericho asked if <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> was unhappy, Cass said the incident was the first straw in what eventually led to him being fired one month later.</p>
      <blockquote>“That is the understatement of the century. Furious… he was furious. That was the first straw, rightfully so. That was such a bad decision. So stupid.”</blockquote>

      <h4>Where is Big Cass now?</h4>
      <p>Since being fired by WWE in June 2018, Big Cass has been very open about the battles he has faced with his mental health and alcoholism.</p>
      <p>The 7-footer, who suffered a seizure in December 2018, returned to in-ring action in April 2019 and he went on to face Jon Moxley at a Northeast Wrestling event later in the summer.</p>
      <p>Following a <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/pro-wrestling-rumors-backstage-details-on-big-cass-incidents-with-wwe-producer-joey-janela">setback in his recovery</a> in September 2019, Cass is currently in rehab and, according to his <a href="https://twitter.com/real1/status/1173963974641180674/photo/1">latest public update via nZo (fka Enzo Amore)</a>, he does not yet know whether he will return to wrestling.</p>
