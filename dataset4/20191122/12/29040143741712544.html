      <ul>
        <li>AT&amp;T today announced that it will launch its 5G service for consumers next month.</li>
        <li>Its 5G service will initially be available in Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Providence, Rochester, and San Diego.</li>

      <p>AT&amp;T will finally roll out its 5G service for consumers sometime early next month. Initially, its 5G service will only be available in five cities: Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Providence, Rochester, and San Diego.</p>
      <p>The carrier <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/att_5g_leadership.html">says</a> its 5G service for consumers will also be available in Boston, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, New York City, San Francisco, Birmingham, Bridgeport, Buffalo, Louisville, San Jose, and a few other markets "soon after." It expects to expand 5G coverage nationwide within the first half of 2020. Even though its 5G service is currently not available for consumers, AT&amp;T has already published 5G coverage maps, so customers can see exactly where the service will be available in different cities.</p>
      <p>AT&amp;T will start <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293382-13650413%3Fsid%3DUUacUdUnU82726YYw%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.att.com%252Fbuy%252Fphones%252Fsamsung-galaxy-note10plus-5g-256gb-aura-glow.html&amp;token=YkQyV2Ds">pre-orders</a> for its first low-band 5G device for consumers, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review">Galaxy Note 10+</a> 5G, on November 25.
