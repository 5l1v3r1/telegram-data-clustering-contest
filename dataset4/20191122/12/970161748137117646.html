      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> has revealed she was once asked to join EastEnders for a guest role and suddenly we’ve never wanted anything more.</p>
      <p>The Drag Race superstar – who finally <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rupauls-drag-race-star-michelle-visage-insists-onscreen-feud-cheryl-banter-11198222/">cleared up her supposed ‘feud’ with Cheryl</a> this week – is an icon wherever she steps foot and would no doubt go down a storm with the residents of Walford.</p>
      <p>Could Michelle be Kat Moon’s long lost American twin? Easily, and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> star revealed her cameo was agonisingly close to happening until former showrunner Dominic Treadwell-Collins stepped down as EastEnders boss.</p>
      <p>However, the offer is still on the table and she’s ready for her soap debut.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She told Good Housekeeping magazine that she prefers EastEnders to Coronation Street because ‘I believe I am Kat [Moon’s] American cousin.’</p>
      <p>‘I’m still vying for that guest role,’ she teased.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Jessie Wallace is totally on board too and tweeted: ‘I believe this too! @michellevisage.’</p>

      <p>The mum-of-two<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/michelle-visage-defends-risky-voguing-routine-strictly-come-dancing-exit-11172458/"> vogued to Madonna</a> as a nod to her gay brothers and sisters, but was slammed by viewers who claimed ‘voguing isn’t dancing’.</p>
      <p>Understandably, the force of nature fired back with a heroic post.</p>
