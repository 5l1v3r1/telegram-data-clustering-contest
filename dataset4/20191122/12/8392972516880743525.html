      <h2>Should there be two versions of the show?</h2>

      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> are demanding another series but with ordinary people rather than famous faces.</p>
      <p>The show, hosted by <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a>, currently sees 12 celebrities go into the jungle and try to survive three weeks Down Under.</p>
      <p>But viewers are now calling for ITV to launch a whole new series featuring non-famous people as they think it would be an instant hit.</p>

      <p>Tensions have been rising among the celebrities in the jungle this year and it hasn't even been a week yet.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday's episode, Ian Wright snapped at <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-stunned-as-ian-wright-snaps-at-andrew-maxwell-over-dinner/">Andrew Maxwell when he tried to encourage him to eat more of their crocodile dinner</a>.</p>
      <aside>I'm definitely backing an I'm A Celebrity show but for normal people.</aside>
      <p>Meanwhile, Andrew also clashed with Jacqueline Jossa in the episode <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-divided-over-rude-jacqueline-jossa-as-she-snaps-at-campmate/">when she said they shouldn't be putting pressure on each other to do Bushtucker trials</a>.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was panicking so much yesterday and it didn't make it better people going if you don't even try we're going to get nothing. It makes it ten times worse."</p>
      <p>Andrew replied: "Was that was me you were talking about?" to which Jacqueline confirmed it was.</p>

      <p>"I won't do that again.  We're all still learning on the job."</p>
