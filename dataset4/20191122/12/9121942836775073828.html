      <p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Winless since early October, Nebraska hasn’t abandoned hopes of salvaging a season that has failed to live up to expectations.</p>
      <p>The Cornhuskers were ranked No. 24 to start the season and opened with a win over South Alabama before blowing a 17-point lead in a loss at Colorado. Nebraska was still 4-2 after squeezing past Northwestern on Oct. 5 before four straight defeats took the air out of Scott Frost’s second year as head coach.</p>
      <p>All is not lost. If Nebraska (4-6, 2-5 Big Ten) beats Maryland on Saturday and upsets Iowa at home next week, a bowl bid is sure to follow.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great setup,” linebacker Mohamed Barry said.</p>
      <p>Frost understands the situation, but after watching the Cornhuskers stumble week after week, he’s reluctant to even mention the word “bowl.”</p>
      <p>“You guys do plenty of talking about those things for us,” Frost said. “We just need to win. That’s it.”</p>
      <p>Maryland (3-7, 1-6) has endured a similarly disappointing season under first-year coach Michael Locksley. The Terrapins won two straight at the outset to earn a No. 21 ranking but have since lost seven of eight, including the last five in a row.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>All that’s left for the Terrapins to play for is pride and on behalf of the team’s seniors in their final home game.</p>
      <p>“It’s about sending our seniors out the right way,” Locksley said. “We’ve got some guys that have been through a lot during their Maryland football careers here.”</p>
      <p>To say the least. The fifth-year seniors have played under three different head coaches (Randy Edsall, DJ Durkin, Locksley) and two interim head coaches (Locksley and Matt Canada).</p>
      <p>Worse, they endured the death of a teammate. Offensive lineman Jordan McNair died on June 13, 2018, 15 days after collapsing during an offseason team workout.</p>
      <p>All those coaches, McNair’s death and five straight losing seasons is quite a bit to handle.</p>
      <p>“For these guys to be still standing and still really proud of wearing the Maryland colors, fighting every day and coming off practice, having a positive impact on the younger players in our program, it speaks volumes to the character of these kids,” Locksley said.</p>

      <p>Some other things to know about Saturday’s Nebraska-Maryland matchup:</p>
      <p>CHANGE THE CULTURE</p>
      <p>Frost and Locksley are trying to turn around the mindset of teams that have seemingly forgot how it feels to win.</p>
      <p>“In some ways, winning is a habit and losing is a habit,” Frost said. “I think there are few too many guys on our team who are conditioned to not win. We need to flip that and make sure winning is a habit. To do that, you have to get one, and it’s been too many weeks since we’ve gotten one.”</p>
      <p>Ditto for Maryland.</p>
      <p>“It starts with playing with the great effort and the mentality that you need to play with,” Locksley said. “I just think we’ve been really inconsistent.”</p>
      <p>FIRST TIMER</p>
      <p>This will be Nebraska’s first road game at Maryland, and now the Cornhuskers have played in every Big Ten stadium.</p>
      <p>It’s also Nebraska’s first game in Maryland, making this the 33rd state in which the Cornhuskers have played a football game</p>
      <p>“Beautiful area,” said Frost, who took Central Florida to the stadium in 2017.</p>
      <p>QUARTERBACK MATCHUP</p>
      <p>Nebraska’s Adrian Martinez threw for 220 yards and a touchdown last week against Wisconsin and ran for 89 yards and a score.</p>
      <p>Maryland will shuffle two, maybe three quarterbacks, on Saturday. Josh Jackson and Tyrrell Pigrome get most of the snaps, but Locksley has also installed a package for highly touted freshman Lance LeGendre.</p>
      <p>MEMORIES</p>
      <p>Maryland defensive lineman Brett Kulka will be playing in his 48th game on Saturday — and the last at home.</p>
      <p>The fifth-year senior got to play in one bowl game, but that won’t be his most vivid memory when he looks back on his career with the Terrapins.</p>
      <p>“It’s the relationships you build here,” Kulka said. “I’ve seen a lot of faces come through and I’ve made a lot of friends. The grind that you go through as a college athlete is something you can share with your teammates.”</p>
