      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:49:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Carter</a></address>
      <p>Stephen Mulhern has joked he'll smash <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a>'s faces in after they made a dig at him on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>On last night's show, the duo poked fun at Stephen's presenting career as they discussed a game Ian Wright was playing with his fellow campmates, in which they had to race to open their water bottles and drink.</p>
      <p>Ant said: "Well done Ian, well done. I'm not sure about it. If you ask me, it's cheap, it's one dimensional, and it's very low rent."</p>

      <p>Ant wrote on their joint Twitter account: "Hi @StephenMulhern hope you're watching the show tonight??"</p>
      <p>Stephen replied on Friday: "Didn’t see the show, as was too busy filming the Xmas special of ‘In for A Penny’, making more money for you two millionaires. #happychristmas.</p>
      <p>"Mention me again and I’ll smash your faces in."</p>
      <p>Fans were in hysterics, with one replying: "Oh this is so funny @antanddec please keep the joke going."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Haha love it Stephen," while a third added: "You guys crack me up."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Later in the show last night, Caitlyn Jenner was talking about her famous family and Ant cracked another joke.</p>
      <p>He joked that the Kardashians should get their own reality TV show - which, of course, they already have.</p>
      <p>Ant then said: "We've got Stephen Mulhern's Quick Draw and a reality show for the Kardashians," to which Dec added: "We're on fire tonight."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV.</p>
