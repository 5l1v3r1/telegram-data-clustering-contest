      <p>Scotland have been drawn against Israel in the Euro 2020 play-off semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Aiming to reach their first major finals in 22 years, Steve Clarke's side will face Israel in a one-legged tie at Hampden Park on March 26.</p>
      <p>The winner of that match will go on to face either Norway or Serbia in the Path C final five days later.</p>
      <p>Scotland beat Israel 3-2 at Hampden Park last November en route to topping their Nations League group and Clarke is after a repeat result in four months' time.</p>

      <p>"The draw is what it is," he told Sky Sports News. "I never get too carried away about who you are going to play.</p>
      <p>"It would been nice to repeat the home win, but the match will come with its own level of pressure, which we will have to embrace.</p>
      <p>"Being at home is very important for us. I'm sure Hampden will be full, with the Tartan Army on the march. It's a great stadium when it's full, so if we start fast we can get them all behind us."</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland are on course to meet in the Path B final, having been drawn away to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovakia respectively in the semis.</p>
      <p>In Path A, Romania travel to Iceland and Bulgaria host Hungary, while Belarus are at Georgia and North Macedonia face Kosovo in Path D.</p>
      <p>The four play-off winners will join the 20 teams that have already qualified for the finals, which will take place in 12 different cities next year.</p>
