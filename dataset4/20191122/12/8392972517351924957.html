      <h1>Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden hits back at troll who accuses him of being a bad actor</h1>
      <h2>He was forced to defend himself...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:56:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Fear</a></address>
      <p>Matthew Wolfenden has felt the need to defend himself, after the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> star was trolled by a follower who accused him of being a bad actor.</p>
      <p>On Friday morning (November 22), Matthew - who portrays David Metcalfe in the ITV soap - lashed out at a Twitter user who attacked him personally for no reason.</p>

      <p>David was in a playful mood when one Twitter user asked him, in response to an Emmerdale storyline: "Don't people in soap land practice safe sex?"</p>
      <aside>It's kinda hurtful and, to be fair, needn't be posted on here.</aside>
      <p>Matthew, ever the joker, replied: "YES! If we 'do it' outside, we always wear high vis jackets. If we 'do it' on a top bunk, we always make sure the sides are up and finally if we 'do it' on a building site, we always make sure we have a hat hard on."</p>
      <p>But one follower was displeased, replying: "Your comments are as bad as your acting!"</p>

      </p>
      <p>Matthew, clearly stung by the comment, lashed out at the user called honeybun, saying: "That's ever so kind of you, faceless troll tweeter.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps before you post such negativity towards another human being on here (if you are a human... your pic suggests you are a dog with a crown of flowers, but I'm assuming if you were, your paws would make it almost impossible to type. So I would surmise you are human) maybe think what you would feel like if someone told you that you were [bleep] at your job (if you have one).</p>
      <p>"It's kinda hurtful and, to be fair, needn't be posted on here. If you did it to get a rise from me... congrats... here you have it. I hope it gets you more followers. Give yourself a pat on the head and a bonio. Lots of love ([bleep] actor) Matthew."</p>

      <p>As honeybun claimed she didn't watch Emmerdale anymore because "the writers have let it down", others rushed to defend dad-of-three Matthew.</p>
      <p>One said: "Aww bless you Matthew, you're a fantastic actor and enjoy seeing you. You make me laugh, smile, cry. That's a class actor who can do that."</p>
      <p>Another said: "You shouldn't let trolls get to you.. I hope you and your family have a lovely weekend. I'm sure yours will be better than theirs."</p>
      <p>A third agreed, typing: "You are a brilliant actor and don't let a keyboard warrior tell you different. Don't rise to their [bleep], you know to ignore someone hurts them more."</p>

      <p>Just recently, Matthew's wife and co-star Charley Webb also lashed out at trolls who criticised her sons for having long hair.</p>
      <p>Charley is currently enjoying maternity leave after welcoming her third child, but felt the need to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-star-charley-webb-hits-out-at-critics-of-her-sons-hair/">hit back at those who claim she needs to cut her sons' hair</a>.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "I get asked so many times on here why my kids have long hair. The answer is really simple, because we like it and, more importantly, they like it."</p>
      <p>She went on to say she "absolutely" doesn't feel the need to explain herself, but that "life would be so much easier if we all focused on our own lives".</p>
      <p>She finished by saying: "There's enough awful stuff in the world without being mean to each other."</p>
      <p>Charley has also pleaded with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdales-charley-webb-makes-plea-for-kindness-with-pic-of-baby-ace/">social media users to "be kind"</a> and had <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/charley-webb-fans-defend-emmerdale-star-over-comment-about-eyebrows/">fans leap to her defence when a troll criticised her eyebrows</a>.</p>
