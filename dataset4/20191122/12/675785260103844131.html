      <h2>Mourinho will take charge of his first game at Spurs when they take on West Ham on Saturday and the new manager said he hopes it will be the first of many</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has hinted his job at Tottenham could be his last before returning to his native Portugal.</p>
      <p>After starting his career at Benfica the 56-year-old has gone on to manage in England, Italy and Spain, not spending more than three seasons at a time at any one club.</p>
      <p>Mourinho admitted, however, that he was envious of his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> predecessor Mauricio Pochettino, who stayed in north London for just over five years, and said he would like to emulate the Argentinean.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: "I am 57. 56, even- 56-years-old! Last club in England? I would love that to be the case.</p>

      <p>"I would love to stay many years. I say many years but I know realistically how football is. If I could do a Mauricio for five-and-a-half years, it would be amazing.</p>
      <p>"I would be 61- then 10 more years. Vitoria Setubal in Portugal maybe the last job."</p>
      <p>Mourinho signed a contract which expires in the summer of 2023, but it remains to be seen if he manages to keep his job that long.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss appears desperate to win Spurs their first trophy since 2008, and reportedly gave an inspiration speech to his new players in their first training session in which he vowed to be "your father, friend, girlfriend, whatever you want."</p>
      <p>He also insisted in his first press conference that he was not interested in signing new players, saying he was delighted with the squad he had inherited.</p>

      <p>"I couldn't be happier," he said. "I do not need new players. I just need to get to know these ones better. I know them well – but you never know them well enough until you meet them.</p>
      <p>"I told the players I came here because of them. I tried to buy some for different clubs and some I didn’t even try, because you know how difficult it was."</p>
