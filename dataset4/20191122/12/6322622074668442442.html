      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s net profitfell 14.36% to RM1.01 billion for the third-quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19), from RM1.18 billion a year earlier, due to higher operating expenses and provisions, despite an increase in operating income.</p>
      <p>Quarterly operating income increased 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM4.64 billion from RM4.14 billion, on the back of stronger capital market-driven non-interest income (NOII), according to the group’s filing with Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The group’s revenue rose 12.03% to RM4.64 billion, from RM4.14 billion, it said.</p>
      <p>For the nine-month period (9MFY19), CIMB’s net profit dropped 16.91% to RM3.71 billion from RM4.47 billion in the previous corresponding period, while revenue eased marginally by 0.26% to RM13.27 billion from RM13.31 billion.</p>
      <p>CIMB group chief executive officer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz said he is pleased to see that the group’s underlying performance remained strong, despite the challenging environment.</p>
      <p>“The better performance was driven by higher net interest income and non-interest income, coupled with lower provisions,” he said in a press statement.</p>
      <p>“Our balance sheet growth remained strong with loans and deposits growing steadily, driven by our Malaysian consumer business,” he added.</p>
      <p>The group recorded a strong operating income (+7.2% y-o-y) at RM13.27 billion in 9MFY18, underpinned by growth in net interest income (NII) and NOII.</p>
      <p>NII grew 5.0% y-o-y to RM9.31 billion from the 5.6% loan growth, while the 12.8% improvement in NOII to RM3.96 billion came largely on the back of improved capital market activity, the group said.</p>
      <p>It added that net interest margin (NIM) slightly declined to 2.47% in 9MFY19 (2.52% in 9MFY18), mainly from the spread compression in Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the group’s total gross loans grew by 5.6% y-o-y, with strong growth posted by Thailand (+9.0%) and Malaysia (+4.5%).</p>
      <p>Total deposits were 7.3% higher y-o-y, contributed by Malaysia (+8.9%) and Thailand (+6.1%). The loan to deposit ratio (LDR) stood at 91.6% (93.1% at Sept 18), reflecting a strong liquidity position, with CASA (current and savings account) ratio strengthening to 34.3%.</p>
      <p>The group’s gross impairment ratio stood at 3.2% as at end-Sept 2019, with an allowance coverage of 94.8%.</p>
      <p>“The group has been investing for the future to ensure we remain resilient and competitive,” Tengku Zafrul said.</p>
      <p>“We are happy that the investments put in place, specifically in Touch ‘n Go, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, have already shown encouraging results,” he said.</p>
      <p>CIMB Group’s share price closed one sen or 0.19% lower at RM5.37 today, valuing the group at RM53.29 billion.</p>
