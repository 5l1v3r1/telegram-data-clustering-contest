      <p>Visiting restrictions remain in place at Mayo University Hospital following a number of suspected cases of Norovirus.</p>
      <p>The vomiting bug hit Ward C and Surgical Ward D earlier this week and has not abated despite the restrictions.</p>
      <p>Two six-bed wards have been blocked off as a result of the infection.</p>
      <p>It is understood six members of staff have gone down ill as a result of the outbreak.</p>
      <p><i>The Connaught Telegraph</i> has also learned that a sink in Surgical Ward D has been broken for a number of weeks without efforts being taken to repair it.</p>
      <p>While staff and patients have been supplied with alcohol hand gels, the effects of such gels can wear off within a relatively short period of time.</p>
      <p>In regard to the sink issue, a HSE spokesperson stated: "There is an on-going repair and replacement maintenance programme in place across the hospital."</p>
      <p>In a statement issued earlier this week hospital management said it is  imperative that only essential visits take place at this time, and children should not visit the hospital as they may be particularly susceptible to the illness.</p>
      <p>Visitors were asked to comply with the restrictions, and to use the alcohol hand gels supplied as they enter and leave the hospital.</p>
      <p>The statement added there had been an increase in the number of cases of Norovirus in the community and anyone with recent symptoms of the vomiting bug should not visit patients in the hospital in order to avoid spreading the virus.</p>
