      <p>Indian Information Technology (IT) experts have expressed their desire that Singapore should set up a billion-dollar funding arrangement for investments in Indian start-ups that are poised for exponential growth.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the sidelines of the recent Singapore FinTech Festival 2019 that took place from 11 to 15 Nov, Girija Pande and Mohandas Pai told the Press Trust of India – India’s largest news agency – that Singapore should invest a billion dollars in at least 1,000 start-ups in India.</p>
      <p>Both Pande and Pai are described as “IT stalwarts”. Pande, the chairman of management consulting firm Apex Avalon Consulting, asserted: <i><b>“We want much more investment in start-ups from Singapore.”</b></i></p>
      <p>Pai, a technologist and venture capitalist, echoed Pande’s views and called on Singapore to join hands with India in building up the start-up ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Noting that India produces 800,000 predominantly young engineers a year and that two out of every six US-based engineers are from India, Pai said: <i><b>“India clearly dominates this field and will keep dominating. There is no other country that can match India in software skill.”</b></i></p>
      <p>Pointing out that India has over 40,000 start-ups with 5,000-6,000 new entities joining the sector each year, he said: <i><b>“By 2025, we will have 1,00,000 start-ups and create USD 500 billion of value and employ 3.25 million people.”</b></i></p>
      <p>Both Pai and Pande also stated that Japan is working on a USD 200 million funding arrangement for start-up investments in India.</p>
      <p>Investments in India is not an entirely foreign concept to the authorities in Singapore. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC has invested considerable funds in India’s real estate and infrastructure sectors.</p>
      <p>In June, we reported that GIC is reportedly planning to invest approximately S$1 billion in Indian infrastructure, specifically for buying operating toll and annuity road assets, in order to strengthen its presence in India.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, GIC co-invested 8,000 crores in the airports business of India’s GMR Group for a 15 per cent stake. GIC also co-invested 2,060 crores in Indian infrastructure investment trust IndiGrid and another S$495 million in India’s renewable energy firm Greenko Group.</p>
      <p>The Singapore Government also made plans with the state of Andhra Pradesh to build a futuristic state capital called Amaravati City. Singapore firms suffered losses of a few million dollars when the new Andhra Pradesh administration scrapped the joint project once it came into power.</p>
      <p>This November, the project was officially cancelled and is set to undergo voluntary liquidation. Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S. Iswaran explained that the new Andhra Pradesh government had “other priorities” for the state. -/TISG</p>
