      <p>A glowing jar of cranberry jelly makes a good present, as it’s bound to be useful on The Day, or else for sandwiches afterwards. This one is spiked with gin, which makes for a sophisticated flavour. Most of the booze is boiled off in the cooking process, but if you want to keep it alcohol-free, omit the final two tablespoonfuls of gin.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 30 minutes, plus overnight straining | <b>Cooking time</b>: 50 minutes</p>
      <h3>MAKES</h3>
      <p>Four 200ml jars </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>800g cranberries (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>800ml water</li>
        <li>Black pepper (optional) </li>
        <li>Peel from 1 orange</li>
        <li>100ml gin plus 2 tbsp </li>
        <li>500g sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring the cranberries and water to the boil, adding a grinding of black pepper if you like. Simmer for 20 minutes, then scoop out half a teacupful of whole berries. Keep to one side. Bash the rest with a potato masher or a wooden spoon and simmer for a further 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Line a plastic sieve with muslin or a clean J-cloth-type cloth and sit this over a bowl. Pour in the cranberry mush and leave to drain overnight. </li>
        <li>Have ready four scrupulously clean 200ml jars, which you have rinsed with boiling water and allowed to dry.</li>
        <li>Cut Christmassy shapes from orange peel, put them in a bowl and cover with boiling water. </li>
        <li>Measure the strained cranberry liquid and make it up to 700ml with water. Pour into a pan and add the 100ml gin and sugar. Heat gently then bring to the boil. Boil until it reaches a rolling boil, a furious mass of bubbles rising up to the top of the pan (106C on a thermometer if you have one). Take the pan off the heat and pop a few drops on a cold saucer.</li>
        <li>Wait a couple of minutes, then push the puddle of jelly with your fingernail. It should wrinkle – if not, return the pan to the heat and boil again for another minute before testing again. </li>
        <li>Once the jelly is ready, ladle it into the jars. Leave to stand until tepid, then with tweezers or a spoon push the orange peel shapes and reserved whole cranberries into the jelly (if you do this while the jelly is too hot they will float to the top).</li>
        <li>Leave to cool completely, then put the lids on tightly. Try not to move the jars for 24 hours. </li>
      </ol>
