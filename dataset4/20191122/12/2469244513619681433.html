      <p>Avoid the rush of Black Friday thanks to the Vospers Black Tag Event.</p>
      <p>Vospers is giving you the chance to take your time, properly browse and make a considered new car purchase at a great price with its special Black Tag Event which started on Monday, November 18 and lasts for almost two weeks - ending November 30, 2019. </p>
      <p>For the duration of the Vospers Black Tag Event, you can get an extra £500 off* the list price of a new car, on top of other offers - an unmissable deal!</p>
      <p>With five new car showrooms to browse at Vospers Matford Exeter and seven at Vospers Marsh Mills Plymouth, there’s a great selection of makes and models available to find your ideal car at a fantastic price - not something you’ve just settled for or felt rushed into buying because of a one day or weekend offer.</p>
      <p>Without the pressure of great discounts lasting for only a day, but for almost two weeks, you’ll be able to browse, take the car out for a test drive, and get yourself fully up to speed on all the technology, safety features and options, making an informed choice and securing a Black Friday-esque price. </p>
      <p>So, if you’re considering a new car, and want to secure a Black Friday bargain, why wait? Head down to Vospers and take advantage of the Black Tag Event. It’s an opportunity you don’t want to miss.</p>
      <p>Family run since 1946, Vospers means motoring in the south west. With one of the largest ranges of new car makes and models to choose from across Devon and Cornwall, the business' new supersite at Matford Exeter includes showrooms for well-known brands such as Ford, Fiat, Abarth, Mazda, Jeep and Alfa Romeo – with other manufacturer showrooms also available in Plymouth for Renault, Nissan, SEAT, and Peugeot.</p>
