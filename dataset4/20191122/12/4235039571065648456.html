      <p>Greek Deputy Minister for Migration Policy <b>Giorgos Koumoutsakos</b> warns that Europe is facing a new migrant crisis.</p>
      <p>Koumoutsakos said that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of migrants. This happened during a conference on the future of EU migration policy in Vienna. According to him, the situation is not the same as in 2015, but warns that a new crisis is ahead, MIA reported.</p>
      <p>Countries at the EU's external borders are left alone and without the help and solidarity of other countries, so migration cannot be controlled, Koumoutsakos criticized.</p>
