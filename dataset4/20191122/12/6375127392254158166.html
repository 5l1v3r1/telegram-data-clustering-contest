      <h3>THE House of Representatives led by committee on the welfare of children chairperson and Tingog party-list Rep. Yedda Marie Romualdez affirmed its commitment to protect and promote the welfare of Filipino children through the conduct of a capacity-building forum.</h3>
      <p>As part of the celebration of the 27th National Children’s Month and the 30th Anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the House organized a forum held last Tuesday to advance the capacity of the House Secretariat on issues related to children.</p>
      <p>Romualdez, wife of House Majority Leader and Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez, opened the forum by emphasizing the duty of the House in ensuring that Filipino children are protected and nurtured.</p>
      <p>“As we celebrate the National Children’s Month as mandated by Presidential Proclamation 267, we do not only highlight the importance of protecting children against all forms of abuse and exploitation but more so we remind ourselves of our bigger role as leaders in nurturing the child as a community and as a State. It is our duty as legislators not only to ensure that we safeguard the justice but also to give equal opportunities and allow children their full potential regardless of the sexual orientation, gender expression, socio economic status, ethnicity or medical disability. In doing so, we not only ensure the future of every child but also that of our country,” said Romualdez.</p>
      <p>Romualdez shared that as a mother of four, the protection of children is a matter close to her heart even before she became a legislator and a “mother to Eastern Visayas.”</p>
      <p>But she acknowledged that efforts of individual mothers or even families are not enough because the protection of children’s rights is primarily incumbent upon the State.</p>
      <p>She called for concerted and united action in ensuring legislation and other State action prioritizing children’s rights because the future of the Philippines as a whole depends on the youth.</p>
      <p>“We must never be too complacent as what is at stake here is not only our own future nor the future of our children, but rather the entire country for decades to come. The protection of the Filipino child is one that would resonate to the majority if not to all our fellow countrymen, and yet it is an issue that has never taken center stage,” she said.</p>
      <p>Atty. Anjanette Saguisag, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Philippines Social Policy Section and Advocacy chief, provided the general principles behind the Convention on the Rights of the Child and discussed the systemic hurdles faced by Filipino children.</p>
      <p>In particular, data situation analysis has revealed that 2.85 million Filipino children between 5 to 10 years old are out of school; 2 out of 3 Filipino children have been victims of violence; and 1 out of 4 are victims of sexual violence are among the child rights issues facing children.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Council for the Welfare of Children Executive Director Mary Mitzi Cajayon-Uy, a former Caloocan City congresswoman, presented the Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Rights of Child.</p>
      <p>Cajayon-Uy also outlined recommendations for legislative reforms that would uplift the lives of children in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Mika Kanervavuori, Senior Human Rights Adviser of the United Nations, presented a rundown of different international treaties and conventions like the Hague and Geneva Conventions, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR 1966), and other human rights frameworks protecting the welfare and rights of children.</p>
      <p>House committee affairs bureau cluster III Director Jannalenna Olladas highlighted the importance of providing relief goods that are culturally sensitive and take into account the needs of children, as current practices often lead to wastage.</p>
      <p>Olladas also hoped that the Social Development Act would be reviewed and amended to further strengthen the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in its role of accrediting social welfare agencies to allow more efficient delivery of social services.</p>
