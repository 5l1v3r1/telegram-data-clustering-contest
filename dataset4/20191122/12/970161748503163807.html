        <b>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/victorias-secret-fashion-show-officially-cancelled-11199024/">Victoria’s Secret fashion show has officially been cancelled</a> after 23 years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since 1995, Victoria’s Secret have held a runway show with top models – branded ‘angels’ – to show off all of their wildest wares.</p>
      <p>This year however the angels will not be taking flight as the show will not be taking place.</p>
      <h3>Why has the Victoria’s Secret fashion show been cancelled?</h3>
      <p>The show has been cancelled after years of falling views.</p>
      <p>Last year, 3.3 million people tuned in to the runway show. This might sound impressive, however these numbers pale in comparison to the show in 2001 which drew in 12 million viewers.</p>
      <p>In third quarter results announced earlier this week, Victoria’s Secret’s parent company L Brands reported a net loss of $252m (£195.1m) in third quarter results announced this week.</p>

      <p>When asked if the show would be taking place, Stuart Burgdoerfer, the chief financial officer of the company, replied: ‘We’ll be communicating to customers, but nothing that I would say is similar in magnitude to the fashion show.</p>

      <p>‘We’re figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand.’</p>
      <p>This news also comes after chief marketing officer Ed Razek stepped down, following comments he made about how <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/30/munroe-bergdorf-launches-valentines-lingerie-line-victorias-secret-refused-use-trans-models-8413380/">the brand didn’t think ‘transsexuals’ should be part of the Victoria’s Secret show.</a> He later apologised.</p>
      <p>It’s not yet known whether the show will be taking place again next year.</p>
