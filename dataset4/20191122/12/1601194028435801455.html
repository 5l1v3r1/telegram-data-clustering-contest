      <h4>What's the story?</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/india-national-cricket-team">Indian Cricket Team's</a> physiotherapist, Nitin Patel showcased the Spirit of Cricket by attending to Bangladeshi batsman, Nayeem Hasan after a bouncer from Mohammad Shami hit him on the helmet.</p>
      <h4>The background</h4>
      <p>The historic pink-ball Test match between India and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> is underway at Eden Gardens. Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque had won the toss and chose to bat first in Kolkata. However, his batsmen could not take the advantage of the first session as the Indian pace bowlers ran through their batting lineup.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Bangladesh lost all their wickets for mere 106 runs. Ishant Sharma proved to be the star for India with five wickets while Umesh Yadav and Shami accounted for the other five wickets between themselves.</p>

      <p>As mentioned ahead, a short-pitched delivery from Mohammad Shami hit Nayeem hard on his head as all the Indian players rushed to check him in the middle. This accident happened during the 23rd over of Bangladesh's first innings. Concerned about the health of the Bangladeshi player, the Indian doctors led by physio Nitin Patel came out in the middle to check Nayeem.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the doctors cleared him to take part in the match and he scored 19 runs off 28 deliveries for Bangladesh before Ishant Sharma cleaned him up. Just a few balls prior to this incident, Liton Das had to leave the field courtesy of Ishant's deadly bouncer. Bangladesh had to name Mehidy Hasan as the concussion substitute for him.</p>
      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>The home side is currently cruising in the day-night Test match as they have added 35 runs on the scoreboard however, they have lost the precious wicket of the in-form Mayank Agarwal. India are trailing Bangladesh by 71 runs with 9 wickets in hand.</p>
