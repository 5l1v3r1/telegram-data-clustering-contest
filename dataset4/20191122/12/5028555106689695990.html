      <h1>How Modern Warfare smooths over the horrors of war</h1>
      <h2>The new Call of Duty feels all the more artificial as it grasps for "realism."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:30:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Capozzoli</a></address>
      <p>It's not that “We need that truck” and “Find a gun" are unusual orders to be given in a video game. Certainly not in a <i>Call of Duty </i>video game. The series has always impelled players forward with extended drills of Sergeant Simon Says (“Man that mortar!” “Plant those charges!” “Take out that sniper!”). So normally, I would hop to it reflexively. I’ve called in airstrikes and breached into rooms of uncounted hostiles just because some grizzled green beret barked at me. It’s not that.</p>
      <h3>Game Details</h3>
      <p><b>Developer:</b> Activision and Infinity Ward<br/><b>Platforms</b>: Xbox One, PlayStation4, PC<br/><b>Release Date:</b> Oct. 25, 2019<br/><b>Price</b>: $60<br/><b>ESRB Rating</b>: M for Mature, 17+<br/><b>Links:</b> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SMLMFC6/?tag=arstech20-20">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare">Official website</a></p>
      <p>What strikes me when playing the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-reveal-old-name-new-campaign-new-brutality/"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a> is that the directives are coming from someone who’s 10 years old, tops. He’s telling his sister (no older) to go kill a couple Russian soldiers and steal their truck.</p>
      <p>I’m already familiar with these two as adults in the present, where they’re Hadir and Farah, ultracompetent freedom fighters for the nation of Urzikstan. But this is a flashback to what I’m to understand is their first brush with war, when occupying Russian forces gas their village and kill their father.</p>
      <p>Mind you, that doesn’t stop them from sneaking through the chlorine fog in gas masks, past troops firing perfunctory bullets into the dead or dying. It’s a gutsy performance. They don’t flinch at the gunshots—in fact, they’ve already killed one soldier by then. As Farah, I stalked that soldier from cover and stabbed at him precisely three times, the fatal number for most video game bosses (Hadir, encouragingly after one thrust: “It’s working!”). At the edge of town, Hadir stops near a transport guarded by two soldiers: “If we run away, they’ll catch us.”</p>
      <p>Then, with composure befitting a tier one operator. “We need that truck,” I'm told. “Find a gun.”</p>
      <p>Out of the mouths of relative babies, objectives are updated. The gun is graciously signposted—it’s on top of a covered well in the center of the scene. Hadir wants me to call his cell phone to distract the soldiers, grab the revolver, ice them, and steal the truck.</p>
      <p>The sequence has the kind of logic that I imagine might appeal to a video game character. But I find that when I shoot one of the guards, the other immediately spots me in the tall grass: Game Over. I fail this routine a couple times before a solution occurs to me: I angle Farah up an incline to line up both guards’ heads behind the handgun’s sights, press L3 to steady her aim, and drop both with a single bullet.</p>
      <p>Neither tween acknowledges the double headshot. But the game does: I get an achievement named “Two Birds.”</p>

      <h3>Double action</h3>
      <p>Released in late October, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </i>is filled with scenes and sequences that repackage the horrors of war in a distinctly video-gamey package. To put it plainly, this edition should be familiar to series veterans.</p>
      <p>In the multiplayer mode of 2009’s <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>, for instance, killing two people with one bullet earned you a prog rock riff and an achievement titled "Collateral Damage.” It’s both a plaudit for one of the miniature feats of dexterity players can pull off and a fun little nod to civilian war deaths.</p>
      <p>I’ve known a double-kill is a thing you can do with guns in games for at least that long. It’s one of the many factoids in my mind’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/real-guns-virtual-guns-and-me-1824159338">“gun basket,”</a> as <a href="https://kotaku.com/real-guns-virtual-guns-and-me-1824159338">Kirk Hamilton would put it</a>, alongside the relative merits of red dot and holographic sights. Same goes for where the magazine is located on a bullpup.</p>
      <p>On the subject of storage, this rebooted <i>Modern Warfare</i> continues <i>Call of Duty</i>’s tradition of partitioning itself into three discrete modes: campaign, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/boom-shaka-laka-call-of-dutys-new-gunfight-mode-is-like-nba-jam-with-guns/">competitive multiplayer</a>, and cooperative multiplayer. These distinctions have been an aid to our own tendency as players to compartmentalize things, too. The campaigns bring the clearest authorial intent, but usually these stories clock in at a tidy five-to-seven hours. They’re often viewed as an amuse bouche of wartime gravitas before the competitive multiplayer entrée, where mass murder becomes the swaggering <i>killstreak</i>, and collateral damage gets you new banner art for your player card.</p>
      <p>Infinity Ward design their campaigns in such a way that a well-versed competitive player won’t feel inhibited. Both modes run at the same heart-stopping pace, and skills translate between them one-to-one. So does the arsenal, now more foregrounded than ever, replete with weapon modeling modes that take the games’ metaphorical status as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-01-shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">showroom for gun manufacturers</a> and makes it literal. Want to know if a rifle features a “slow cycle rate” or “a short stroke piston system?"  <i>Modern Warfare</i> expects that you do, and it may well be right.</p>
      <p><i>Modern Warfare</i> does reintroduce some friction into the series’ patented feedback loop. Its multiplayer stages are rats’ nests of back alleys and sneaky sight lines that bog down the flow of movement. I prefer it to the lane-style maps of previous games. It keeps me in the moment, attuned to my surroundings instead of sprinting around to make big, looping attacks on enemy flanks. The guns, which were starting to take on an interchangeable point-and-click precision over the years, now tend to have more dramatically different recoil profiles.</p>
      <p>But these changes can hardly rein in a decades’ worth of evolution in the name of slick, hypersynaptic ergonomy. The speed of <i>Call of Duty</i>, the sensation of being a free camera mounted on a gun, is unchanged, whether you’re playing as a hardened SAS operative or a Middle Eastern child.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that’s why the most effective moments in the campaign are the scenes just preceding that flashback moment, when Farah is trapped under the ruins of a bombed building and can’t move at all. White Helmets pull her from the rubble and deliver her to her father's arms, and from there she can only witness the scenes of ensuing destruction in whirling glimpses.</p>
      <p>Because as soon as she’s boots-on-the-ground again, she will be comfortably back in <i>Call of Duty</i>’s generous possibility space for e-athletes, where even a child who's never held a gun can steady her aim to within a pixel's breadth.</p>

      <h3>That multiplayer, tho</h3>
      <p>There’s an urgency to <i>Modern Warfare</i>’s campaign that’s come undone from any in-fiction justifications. I’m barely told who I’ll be shooting at or why before the game jams my hands full of C4 to plant, molotovs to lob, and remote controlled bombs to pilot. It’s <i>a lot</i>. I have the sensation being harried forward, forward... like some kind of Light Brigade cavalryman being ordered on into the fun, “theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why.”</p>
      <p>Multiplayer neatly solves that problem by nuking any context from orbit. <i>Call of Duty</i> doesn’t even name its factions “Opposing Force” anymore, let alone “Terrorists,” as <i>Counterstrike</i> does. Here it’s “Coalition” versus “Allegiance,” variegated patchworks of nations and military-types, a proxy of proxy wars. They bomb and snipe across a changing series of maps and modes, like the new <i>Battlefield</i>-style large-scale “Ground War,” or the compact 2v2 series, “Gunfight.”</p>
      <p>The game benefits, in a small but noteworthy way, from one successful attempt to capture the horror of war: the soundscape. Rich with booms, pings, and chattering fire, the audio environment plays devilishly with the rattle and spark of the visual environment, sending you ducking and whirling and thinking every explosion and whistle of a bullet was meant for you.</p>
      <p>And the levels themselves, now dense with detail, have made it more difficult to pick out targets from the surroundings, rewarding patience and punishing carelessness.  But fidelity (visual or otherwise) will only benefit these games if it can force them to slow down all the way to the point where players don’t rack up body counts in the high hundreds—where the violence is forced to be fully considered, instead of just providing a new sheen for realistic weapons of war.</p>
      <p>When it was revealed that <i>Modern Warfare</i> would include <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2019/08/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-catches-heat-for-including-white-phosphorus/">white phosphorous</a> as a killstreak reward, there was a smattering of outcry. White phosphorous stands out for its gruesomeness, and for its prolonged, scarring effects, even as it resides in a gray area of international law.</p>
      <p>Certainly there was already nothing humane about the gunships and bombing runs that populate the killstreak catalogue. But the inclusion of white phosphorous is glaring because until now, white phosphorus has had no effective PR. While spec operatives and .50 cal rifles, and <a href="https://twitter.com/deptofdefense/status/968682187779223552?lang=pl">even AC-130 gunships</a>, have been treated to kind mentions in recent media, not many storytellers have been willing to cast the horrors of white phosphorous in a positive light.</p>
      <p>But the US has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/06/09/u-s-led-forces-appear-to-be-using-white-phosphorous-in-populated-areas-in-iraq-and-syria/">likely used white phosphorus</a> in attacks, and so it must be due for image rehabilitation. Games can play an outsized PR role in this, and this attempt to sublimate white phosphorous into that pantheon must be seen as part of that effort. It <i>should </i>bother us, even if we’ve already accepted so much.</p>

      <h3>Pathos for pyros</h3>
      <p>How do you tell a story about the horrors of war to players who’ve been trained up in your own virtual proving grounds? Players who can <a href="https://youtu.be/00DdXue5aBs?t=64">kill eight men with a cinder block</a>? And how do you do it without alienating potential markets (and the Department of Defense)?</p>
      <p>Perhaps you start by drawing lines in the sand. One line forms the borders of a fictional nation, Urzikstan, a mish-mash of Syria, Libya, Afghanistan et alia—it's a county seemingly contrived for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-03-03-ghost-recon-receives-formal-complaint-from-bolivian-government">plausible deniability.</a> It’s the home of Farah and Hadir, but also Al-Qatala, a bald-faced Al-Qaeda stand-in. The game draws another line around the use of chemical weapons (Farah, owing to her past, particularly despises them), a shipment of which you show go missing from a Russian-occupied Urzikstan base.</p>
      <p>And then you start crossing those lines, systematically. Al-Qatala stages a massive terrorist attack in London’s Piccadilly Circus, prompting a Western military response. In a parallel plot, Russia cracks down on the locals in retaliation for the theft of the chemical weapons. Only, it’s technically not Russia: it’s the rogue forces of Russian General Barkov. Video games tend to like these Kurtzian figures, who can antagonize the player on a person-to-person level and provide an effigy that can be beaten satisfactorily (unlike, say, the whole military industrial complex). They’re characters who can wield a nation’s army and yet be said to be atypical of it.</p>
      <p>So when Farah observes of CIA operative Alex, “So you <i>do </i>kill Russians,” the reply can come: “Only the bad ones.” It seems to be Barkov's fictional force that the game, in a much criticized move, holds responsible for the real American war crimes at the "Highway of Death." <a href="https://screenrant.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-review-bomb-russian-players-highway-death/">Notably, real Russians seem a tad skeptical of these artistic liberties.</a></p>

      <h3>I am Trash Man</h3>
      <p>Here is a list of some of the things that General Barkov says if you listen all the way through his broadcast looping in the level “Embedded.”</p>
      <blockquote><i>“These insurgents continue to launch senseless attacks in the name of so-called “freedom.” </i> <br/><br/><i>“There can be no order and no peace until those who side with these savages are permanently eliminated.” </i> <br/><br/><i>“There will be no judge and no jury, only crime and punishment.” </i> <br/><br/><i>“My reserves of manpower are inexhaustible.” </i> <br/><br/><i>“We can make an example of those who refuse.” </i> <br/><br/><i>“These enemies are your friends and families.” </i> <br/><br/><i>“I am a fair man, and a man of swift judgement.” </i></blockquote>
      <p>“Embedded” is one of those "<i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> but for war crimes" theme park-style tours video games are wont to do. Soldiers hold barking dogs just back from forced laborers. Bodies hang from makeshift gallows. There’s a soldier who will continue beating a civilian in a looping animation until you get bored and shuffle on, dutifully crossing some invisible tripwire that triggers the scream and the gunshot that will cut it short. Schlocky propaganda posters with Barkov in front of various slogans are plastered on the walls, and his message drones over the loudspeakers to hammer home the connection between villain and misdeed.</p>
      <p>Barkov’s antagonistic relationship to Farah is one of the story’s main through-lines. As Kotaku reports, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfares-developers-are-still-deci-1835430191">in earlier builds it was charged with more sexual menace</a>, but notably, even in the released version Barkov smiles and inexplicably purrs “perfect” as he captures Farah and Hadir. And when, in a later scene, he waterboards an adolescent Farah, Barkov bizarrely “coaches” the player through their own virtual torture. The minigame awkwardly merges latent paternalism with the crudely gamelike instructions to rotate the joystick to avoid the pouring water.</p>
      <p>Throughout, Barkov alternates between taunts and cries of “How are you doing this!?” As representations of torture go, it feels less like <a href="https://grantland.com/features/line-explores-reasons-why-play-shooter-games/">“the very definition of human evil”</a> than it does cringeworthy melodrama.</p>

      <h3>The Person Closet</h3>
      <blockquote><i>“Good guys look like bad guys around here. Shit’s fucked up.” - </i>Unnamed marine, <i>Modern Warfare</i></blockquote>
      <p>Torture presents a lot of practical problems as a video game device, even when it’s not so clumsily executed. Principally, the problem is that the player is not actually being tortured—they’re not, in fact, experiencing anything even remotely evocative of the sensation of being tortured. The sheer, somatic extremity of such a scene throws the player back out of the body of their avatar and onto their couch. Pain in a video game only makes it through as friction: a vibration in the controller, or a smear of blood across the screen blocking the view. Fear of death runs into the obvious “extra life” problem.</p>
      <p>Surprise, on the other hand, works great. So does the fear that comes from being chased, or fear of the dark. And so that’s what video games do. They bring zombie hordes to swarm after the player without sense of self-preservation, or bash against the outer side of windows. They place creatures behind doors and blind corners, ready to burst forth suddenly or scurry just out of range of a flashlight’s beam.</p>
      <p><i>Modern Warfare</i> does these things, too, but it does them with humans. It does the whole "flashlight" bit in its very first mission, a taut firefight with a few Russian soldiers. Later, it borrows from 2013’s <i>République </i>for a segment where you remotely guide a civilian through a scene of violence, using security cameras for vantage.</p>
      <p>Strikingly, several battles have a preamble, in which the protagonists chatter worriedly about whether men milling nearby are militia plotting an attack or whether cars approaching hold bombs. But the attacks always do come eventually, and when they do,  it’s always hundreds of Al-Qatala fighters. They rush from the dark at the heroes’ positions on high, and they have to be illuminated with flares to see and kill. In other scenes, such as a nighttime raid on a terrorist cell in a walk-up, enemies spring out from doors and side rooms to attack.</p>
      <p>I do not know enough to speak to the realism of these scenes. I only know that they look and feel like things that I’ve done before in many video games that were <i>not</i> purporting to portray the realities of modern warfare. That alone makes me skeptical of the game’s claimed reality and the fears it’s trading on.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, someone has to make the enemy scared of the dark,” says Captain Price, the squad’s leader and one of the game’s moral compasses. But the statement just puts to mind the lengths to which the game works to put that fear on the player.</p>

      <h3>“The Math”</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I keep saying ‘the math,’” Hall continues, reminding the audience in the theater of what the soldiers in the game had encountered in the house before this scene, with nearly every person in the house proving hostile. “All those floors, you keep doing the math. She had a chance to do the right thing. Then she made the bad choice.” -</i>
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/video-games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-behind-the-scenes/">Mitch Hall, retired Navy Seal and <i>Modern Warfare</i> consultant describing the level “Clean House"</a>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Hall’s math there sounds like it refers to simple survival odds, but it belies a moral calculus, too. It’s a tally of justifications, and for it to add up the operator must be assumed to be a null factor, impassively crunching the data provided by their immediate environment. Variables on variables on adrenaline. By simply scripting these problems into a video game, <i>Modern Warfare</i> renders them as deterministic. The player can replay a scene and discover what the “correct” reading was along a binary: either the person was going to shoot at the player and must be killed, or they will not.</p>
      <p>There’s a growing appreciation for how the idea of a “perceived threat” provides police officers an expansive amount of subjective space for justifying the use of lethal force and how it’s susceptible to the influences of bias and irrational fear. Not that we’re any closer to correcting for it, but we’re even further away from extending that understanding out to military operations.</p>
      <p><i>Modern Warfare</i>’s narrative director describes their job thusly, in a recent interview: “So you have imperfect intel, how are you expected to go into those areas and conduct yourself perfectly? That's the burden that these combat operators face. And this was a theme that they thought we could convey and that was a goal for us. And again, to put the player in their shoes and figure out how they, with this imperfect intel, operate perfectly; it's the quandaries, the burden of those operators.”</p>
      <p>In real life, we know that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/edward-gallagher-navy-seal.html">they do not operate perfectly</a> and that the fog and foreignness of war help to shroud that imperfection from the American public (with the help of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/reader-center/navy-seals-edward-gallagher-silence.html">culture of silence</a>). In one sense, that makes <i>Modern Warfare</i>’s disinterest in consequence accurate. There are innocents in its battlegrounds; mistakes can get made and the game will not [always] fail you and restart the level...but there are no dress-downs, no tribunals, only achievements to miss out on for a less-than-perfect run. There are fellow soldiers to fight alongside, but you don’t <i>meet </i>them, or have to take responsibility for their safety, or mourn them if, just speaking hypothetically, a grenade lands near you both and rather than risk throwing it back you just decide to edge a little back and avoid restarting from the checkpoint.</p>
      <p>Only lip service gets paid to regrets. That's true to military life, perhaps. But <i>Modern Warfare</i> also believes, stridently and without reservation, in the heroism of its protagonists, no matter if they sometimes grouse a little about the things they’re asked to do. And how heroic is it, really, to exist completely beyond the grasp of guilt?</p>

      <h3>The canon</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The more cinematically educated the filmmaker, the more aware of his or her unoriginality—and the more sanctimonious rectitude attaches to the stance of realism, of the repudiation of imaginative fancy, of fiction’s inventive and imaginative freedom. The resulting so-called realism is always on the verge of becoming a grotesque lie, because of filmmakers’ unavowedly ideological assumptions regarding the depiction of physical action as more unimpeachably real than states of mind, regarding the selection of certain actions rather than others as constituting a story—or a film.” - Film critic Richard Brody, </i>
        <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-deceptive-emptiness-of-zero-dark-thirty">
          <i>“The Deceptive Emptiness of Zero Dark Thirty”</i>
        </a>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Military consultants notwithstanding, <i>Modern Warfare</i>’s creators have reserved all rights for dramatization. In that regard, they’ve made no secrets about their inspirations. But even in play, they could hardly be more clear. The game echoes Bigelow’s compound raid from <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> more-or-less verbatim; it's Benghazi a la Michael Bay.</p>
      <p>In “Embassy,” the heroes are forced to watch from behind glass as an Al-Qatala enforcer named The Butcher seizes the compound and begins executing the personnel. Eventually, they fall back to a rooftop, under assault from mortar fire and charging fighters. In “Wolf’s Den,” the Bin Laden raid-like, the player takes part in a hunt through the complex of concrete rooms shooting hostiles and securing women and children, before seizing computers and documents.</p>
      <p>Because the game goes nearly shot-for-shot with these films, we’re able to note the very specific revisions it makes. “Embassy” takes <i>13 Hours’</i> base jingoism and hikes the body count even higher on both sides, spooling up an event in which four Americans died (two from smoke inhalation) into a Thermopylae-esque last stand worthy of every hour of Fox News coverage.</p>
      <p>In what is to me the most indelible moment of <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i>, Bigelow brings the camera over the shoulder of a Seal team member as he aims his gun up a staircase landing. In half-whisper, the soldier calls: “<i>Khalid!</i>” to falsely bait out his target, who is shot dead before he even enters frame. A balding, unarmed man wearing a simple tunic slumps to the ground; the soldier fires a final bullet into his body and moves on.</p>
      <p>In <i>Modern Warfare</i>’s version, as the operative approaches the landing, “Al-Qatala Male 2” rounds the corner shouting “You will pay in blood for trespassing here!” before being killed. Replaying the scene a few times, his clothing seems to change: sometimes a tactical vest, sometimes a bandolier. It’s difficult to tell if he has a weapon on his person, but he always has knee pads, fingerless gloves, and a thigh-strap holster.</p>
      <p>In reviewing <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i>, The New Yorker’s Richard Brody criticized the “pseudo-objectivity” disguising its initial assumptions: “The emotional excitement that the movie generates from the start...is itself suspect. If you fall under the movie’s sway, you become complicit in its chain of suggestions and associations.”</p>
      <p><i>Modern Warfare</i> takes that pseudo-objectivity as fact, and then exaggerates it even further in the name of fun and the self-satisfaction of its American player base. When it does so—and we go along with it because we like the feel of the guns or the pleasant “ping” of a headshot—the grotesque lie becomes canon.</p>
