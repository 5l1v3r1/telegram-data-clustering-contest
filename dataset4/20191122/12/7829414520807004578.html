      <p>Bloomberg's chief economist on Friday warned of the trade war’s impact on the global economy, speaking on the sidelines of the 2019 New Economy Forum (NEF). He said that the China-US trade war has had a significant negative impact on global economic growth, and urged the signature of a Phase-One deal which could remove some of the pressure weighing on global growth.<br/><br/>"In the first quarter of 2018, [Bloomberg Economics] data told us the global economy was expanding [at about] 4.8 percent," said Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg.<br/><br/>While the world economy was expanding just 2.4 percent in the third quarter of this year, Orlik said, "The pace of the global growth has halved and a big reason for that is the trade war."<br/><br/>A Phase-One deal in the China-US trade talks is expected to be reached to help release some of the pressure on global growth, including the economic growth of China and the US, he noted.<br/><br/>Gao Feng, spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml">Ministry of Commerce</a> (MOFCOM), said at a regular press briefing on Thursday that Chinese and US trade negotiators will continue to maintain close communications.<br/><br/>"China is willing to make joint efforts with the US based on equality and mutual respect, to properly resolve each other's core concerns in an effort to achieve a Phase-One trade deal," Gao said.<br/><br/>Orlik presented calculations concerning the impact of different trade-war scenarios on growth.<br/><br/>If a Phase-One deal could be reached and tariffs are rolled back to 25 percent on $50 billion worth of goods in bilateral trade, then the US and China would both benefit significantly.<br/><br/>Global Times<br/><b>RELATED ARTICLES:</b></p>
