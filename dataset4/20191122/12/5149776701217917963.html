      <h2>"To me it's like a ticking time bomb knowing your nervous system and organs will give up one day."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:57:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Gurjeet Nanrah</a></address>
      <p>A Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">student</a> has graduated from college despite battling with an illness she has described as a "ticking-time bomb."</p>
      <p>Jade Carter, a 27-year-old <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/fashion">fashion</a> art and design student at Nottingham College, suffers from cystinosis - a rare condition that only affects around 2,000 people in the world.</p>
      <p>Her condition often leaves her face looking "puffy" - affecting her confidence - and suffering from chronic headaches and muscle pains.</p>
      <p>Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder where cells in the body are damaged by a build up of amino acid cystine, forming crystals that particularly affect the kidneys and eyes.</p>
      <p>On top of graduating with a two-one, the ceremony which took place on November 18 at the Royal Concert Hall also saw Jade named as her college's graduate of the year.</p>

      <p>Jade, who is from <a href="https://www.inyourarea.co.uk/areas-we-cover/England/Nottinghamshire/Rise%20Park">Rise Park</a> and has to undergo dialysis as a result of her illness, said: "I feel quite sad that the amazing journey had ended but also, it's a realisation of what I've done and got through.</p>
      <p>"Cystinosis has impacted me in lots of ways. To me it's like a ticking time bomb knowing your nervous system and organs will give up one day. It's scary that we don't live as long as the average person too.</p>
      <p>"It affects my memory and thought process which was very difficult during my degree. Some days my eyes would sting and burn too.</p>
      <p>"My face would be puffy a lot of days which affected my confidence and also, suffering with low iron made me very tired as well."</p>
      <p>As well impacting her learning in college, Jade added that having frequent hospital appointments and remembering to take her medication took her away from her course.</p>

      <p>One of Jade's nurses who visits her at home frequently described her as a "bright, optimistic and fun lady".</p>
      <p>Wendy Spooner, 57, and a clinical nurse specialist for renal home therapy at Nottingham City Hospital, said: "Jade is such an amazing young lady who despite all her health issues - of which there are many - she has such inner-strength and is always positive.</p>
      <p>"When I visit her home, I could always see lots of mannequins everywhere and that shows how enthusiastic she is about her course and her business."</p>
      <p>Last year Jade also launched her own clothing company, "We Are Able Limited', aiming to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/fashion-student-designs-clothing-range-2282769">create a range of fashionable clothing for young people undergoing dialysis</a>.</p>
      <p>She manages the company with the help of her boyfriend, Jay Jackson, which she started as part of a major project during her foundation degree.</p>
      <p>Jade added: "My course did help me realise that I can't get away from my illness though and it's part of who I am. I'm confident and much happier after doing it and it's a dream for me to actually graduate.</p>
      <p>“I feel quite overwhelmed, it doesn't feel real. My tutors encouraged me to be myself and they were just amazing. They’ve allowed me to achieve everything I have.”</p>

      <p>Jade plans on continuing her education - which she said 'takes her away from her illness worries' - by doing a masters in a fashion-related course.</p>
      <p>Liz Labor, Jade's former BA art and design course leader at Nottingham College, said: “We’re so proud of Jade for what she has achieved, and she was a very worthy winner of the graduate of the year award.</p>
      <p>"Jade fought every inch of the way to participate fully on her degree courses with us. In fact, she was often in college when she barely had the strength to stand."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for charity Cystinosis Research Network added: "Cystinosis is among the 5% of rare diseases with approved treatment(s).</p>
      <p>"However, these medications require frequent, around the clock administration and can cause side effects.</p>
      <p>"In addition, remaining compliant with this medication regimen and physician appointments across multiple specialties requires time away from the classroom.</p>
      <p>"Achieving this milestone is a testament to her determination and passion."</p>
