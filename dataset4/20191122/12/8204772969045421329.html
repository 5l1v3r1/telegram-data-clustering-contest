      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Citigroup">Citigroup</a> could move more staff from London to Dublin and Frankfurt, depending on how clients react to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/brexit">Brexit</a>, the US banking giant’s Europe chief executive said.</p>
      <p>“People have made decisions, spent money on platforms that are ready to go but aren’t fully functioning yet because moves have not happened yet,” <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Citibank">Citibank</a> Europe chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Zdenek+Turek">Zdenek Turek</a> said in an interview in Dublin, where the company has 2,500 staff.</p>
      <p>“There is an element of cost associated with that, and the same goes for our customers.”</p>
      <p>Mr Turek, who took his current role in 2016, suggested the New-York based firm could move more staff out of London to cope with the ripples from the UK’s exit from the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=European+Union">European Union</a>, depending on whether clients increasingly shift business out of Britain.</p>
      <p>Citigroup is already creating as many as 200 roles in its existing EU locations because of Brexit, with about 60 jobs moving out of London.</p>
      <p>Any staff moves will be primarily to Dublin and the Frankfurt-based broker-dealer arm, said Mr Turek. “There is a combination of our own interests and regulatory requirements, and if we have to move more people to support those functions,”he said.</p>
      <p>UK prime minister <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Boris+Johnson">Boris Johnson</a> is fighting for a Conservative majority in next month’s election to push his divorce deal with the EU through parliament, though it’s not clear how long it would then take to negotiate a new trade deal.</p>
      <p>UK opposition Labour leader <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jeremy+Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> wants to reopen talks and then hold a referendum to decide whether to implement the new deal that results.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats are campaigning to stop Brexit altogether.</p>
      <h3>Banking integration</h3>
      <p>Mr Turek welcomed German finance minister Olaf Scholz’s attempt to move ahead on European banking integration, adding that he would like deeper capital markets as well as a banking union. Mr Scholz earlier this month suggested Germany may consider easing its opposition to deposit guarantees, an offer that came with a list of demands aimed at reducing risks in the European banking sector.</p>
      <p>“Scholz’s comments were encouraging, but there is still a lot of work to be done,” Mr Turek said. “What was important is it shows that people are now focused on doing something about it.”</p>
      <p>“On capital markets union, we should have border-less Europe,” he said. “We would like an Italian company to be able to raise money in the Netherlands or Spain, and would like that to be routine.”</p>
      <p>Europe’s banking union “urgently needs deepening” and Germany expects to see the first signs of progress by December in its push to speed integration, according to Mr Scholz’s deputy.</p>
      <p>“Our position has just been published so I think we’re still debating a lot of the impulses that we gave,” <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Joerg+Kukies">Joerg Kukies</a>, a state secretary in the finance ministry, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Friday in Beijing. “The key thing is that there will be progress soon.” – Bloomberg</p>
