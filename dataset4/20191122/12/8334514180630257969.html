      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Spain is heading towards a money laundering trial against an uncle of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, the High Court said on Friday, after an investigating judge finished his probe.</p>
      <p>The prosecuting office has ten days to comment on the judge’s recommendation that the case goes ahead, which is considered a formality, after which a trial start date will be set, the court said.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, the High Court confiscated over 600 million euros ($663.24 million) of assets thought to be linked to Rifaat al-Assad.</p>
      <p>He is a former military commander, widely held responsible for crushing an Islamist uprising in 1982 against then-president Hafez al-Assad, Bashar’s father. Many thousands were killed.</p>
      <p>Rifaat al-Assad turned against the government in 1984 after a power struggle over who would succeed his older brother, Hafez. He now lives in exile between France and Britain.</p>
      <p>He is also facing trial in France for allegedly acquiring millions of euros worth of French property assets. ($1 = 0.9046 euros)</p>
