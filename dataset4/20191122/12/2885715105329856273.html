      <p>One father decided to imitate the many moods of his newborn daughter and the compilation of his various expressions has gone viral. Comedian Josh Hawkins from Sydney in Australia recently became a father and taking care of daughter Billie is now his full-time job. At some point, he decided to imitate his daughter’s adorable ‘milk drunk faces’.</p>
      <p>“Copying my daughter’s milk drunk faces is my new full time job”, the pastor-turned-comedian wrote while sharing the hilarious videos. The videos have taken social media by storm, and have been viewed nearly 50 million times on his <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a> page alone. Hawkins even wore headbands and bibs to match those his daughter was wearing while making the expression.</p>

      <p>The compilation featuring yawns, smiles and the pleasure of getting a head rub. Many people have wondered in the comments how he’d managed to come up with such a good imitation, while some said it would make for an ideal gift for her later in life.</p>

      <p>Hawkins credits his wife for the video and told <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yahoo/">Yahoo</a> Lifestyle</i>, “It was like a beautifully choreographed dance,” adding every facial expression and twitch was pre-approved by his spouse.</p>
      <p>The comedian, who is known for his imitations of US President Donald Trump, said explained how he captured the seven-week-old’s expressions for the viral video.</p>
      <p>“After my daughter would hit the milk bar and get herself milk drunk, she would pull the funniest faces and her eyes would go every which way. I captured that on my phone and built up quite the collection,” Hawkins told the media outlet.</p>
