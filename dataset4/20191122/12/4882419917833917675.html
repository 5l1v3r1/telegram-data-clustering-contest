      <p>Real Madrid trained on Friday ahead of Saturday's visit from Real Sociedad, with Gareth Bale present for the second consecutive session and available for selection this weekend 49 days after his last appearance for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>Bale got injured with Wales during the October international break and missed six Madrid games, eventually returning to action for his country in last week's international break. After helping his nation qualify for Euro 2020, he was pictured celebrating in front of a Wales flag with the caption: 'Wales. Gold. Madrid. In that order.' It's caused a lot of controversy in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane gains Bale this weekend, should he pick him, but he has lost Lucas Vazquez, who injured his foot on Thursday. James Rodriguez is also injured, along with Nacho Fernande and Marco Asensio.</p>
      <p>Madrid, joint leaders with Barcelona (25 points), hot an impressive Real Sociedad side, who feature Los Blancos loanee Martin Odegaard. The Basque side are fifth in the table with 23 points so far.</p>
      <p>Zidane's side are in good form. They beat Eibar 4-0 before the international break days after a 6-0 win against Galatasaray. After La Real, they host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.</p>
