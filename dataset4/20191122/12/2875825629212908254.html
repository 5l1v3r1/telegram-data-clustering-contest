      <h2>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has had his say on Jose Mourinho's surprise Premier League return with Tottenham - and claimed he knew his old rival was "desperate" to return to work</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:13:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has welcomed Jose Mourinho back to the Premier League - and joked he knew he was desperate to get back in the dugout.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has sealed a return to management at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , replacing Mauricio Pochettino less than 24 hours after the Argentinian was sacked.</p>
      <p>Klopp admits the situation serves as a reminder of how quickly the game moves having beaten Spurs in the Champions League final less than six months ago.</p>
      <p>Despite initially being shocked by the news, he has sent a message to former rival Mourinho and claimed it will be "interesting" to see how he performs in the hotseat in north London.</p>

      <p>Speaking at his press conference ahead of Saturday's clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , Klopp said: "Welcome back Jose! It's nice to have him back.</p>
      <p>"You could see he was desperate when he was not in (work)!</p>
      <p>"Poch is not there anymore so it shows how quick things change. He did a brilliant job at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>"Outstanding coach, great guy. I enjoyed the games against him, we have a history together.</p>

      <p>"When I first heard it, I couldn't believe it in that moment. I really hope he can enjoy a few days, weeks or months off.</p>
      <p>"Jose is motivated highly, so it will be interesting."</p>
      <p>Whilst Klopp has called on Pochettino to enjoy some time off, speculation is already mounting over his next job.</p>
      <p>He has long been linked with Liverpool's arch rivals, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , but current Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists he does not feel any pressure with Pochettino now on the market.</p>

      <p>“No, it doesn't bother me at all,” said Solskjaer. “I've got the best job in the world and if you're in or out of a job, you want this job, so it doesn't really matter whatever happens around it.</p>
      <p>“I've got to focus on my job at Manchester United and do it as well as we can.</p>
      <p>“I speak with Ed [Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman] and the owners all the time about how we move forward, and that doesn't change if others change managers.</p>
      <p>“It's good to have Jose back, definitely, especially for you guys and maybe for me, because you can talk and write about everything else.</p>
      <p>“For Mauricio, it's always sad when one of your colleagues, a good man, loses his job, especially before Christmas, so I wish him all the best."</p>
