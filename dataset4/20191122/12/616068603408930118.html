      <p>The 30th annual Innkeeper’s Gala at Kelowna's Eldorado Resort will be one to remember, as it raised more money than it ever has in a single year and also brought the three-decade total over a magical mark.</p>
      <p>This year’s event, dubbed the Million Dollar Masquerade, brought in a whopping $84,080 for Kelowna General Hospital Foundation, taking the total raised over its 30-year history past the $1 million mark.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to have been able to raise the bar at this year’s Innkeeper’s Gala and further strengthen our community partnership with KGH,” Eldorado Resort general manager Brent Lavery said in a press release.</p>
