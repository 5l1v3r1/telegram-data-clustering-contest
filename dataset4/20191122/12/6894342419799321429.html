      <h1>Twitter Enables Two-Factor Authentication Without Phone Number</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:22:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>Twitter recently changed its security protocols and final enabled two-factor authentication (2FA, for short) on the app. The new option replaces the previous SMS-based 2FA, which still required users to link their phone numbers to the app.</p>
      <p>The change in Twitterâ€™s 2FA protocol allows clearly serves as a reprieve for many Twitter users, especially since it eliminates the dangers of SIM card swapping attacks. For years, Twitter used SMS for its main two-factor authentication method, even when more viable authentication methods, including Google Authenticator and Yubikey, had been available.</p>
      <p>The removal of SMS-based authentication also prevents the social media platform from sending <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/195975/twitter-phone-numbers-emails-targeted-ads/">target-specific advertisements</a> to said phone numbers. Even for those who declined to use the security method.</p>

      <p>The change in authentication does carry a certain sense of irony. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, became a victim of his own product, when <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/193446/twitter-disables-sms-tweeting-ceo-jack-dorsey-hacked/">his own account was hacked</a> via the old SMS-based authentication process.</p>
      <p>Since the publication of this article, the new 2FA authentication has gone live. However. TechCrunch reports that some users are still being asked to submit their phone numbers.</p>
