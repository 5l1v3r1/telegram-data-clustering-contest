        <b>Behringer has dropped another synth-based teaser video, but this time it's not a brand new product, or is it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Music Tribe brand's version of the Moog Model D has been around for a couple of years now, but it would seem that the Minimoog emulation has been harbouring a secret that Uli Behringer has kept under his hat, until now.</p>
      <p>In this video we see a slightly confused Behringer employee taking a call from Uli eluding to a secret compartment within the <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/the-best-hardware-synthesizers-2018-keyboards-modules-and-portable-synths">synth</a> that features a 'Warp Drive' button.</p>
      <p>There have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVLnihiJFOs">numerous videos showing the insides</a> of a Behringer D and so far no one has found such a compartment.</p>
      <p>In true Behringer fashion, the video is just the beginning and the story will be continued, so be sure to stay tuned from more developments.</p>
