      <p>Turkey has arrested and is now interrogating a high-ranking jihadist terrorist from ISIL in a recent operation in northeastern Syria, the interior minister has announced, identifying the person as Ebu Cihad al-Din al-Nasır Ubeyde, or Yusuf Huba, behind the attacks in Russia and Germany in the past.</p>
      <p>"We have captured a very senior Daesh (Arabic acronym of the ISIL) member who is known as a bomber, bomb-maker and mastermind of suicide bomber attacks. The terrorist is behind the attacks in Russia in 2018 and in Germany's Hamburg. He was caught in Syria and under interrogation there," Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu told <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-catches-key-man-behind-isils-major-hits-148972">Hürriyet Daily News</a> during a visit to Demirören Media Center on Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>Codenamed Yusuf Huba, the terrorist is responsible for around 20 terrorist attacks that claimed the lives of many innocent people, the minister said, adding that Huba also was recruiting and training would-be suicide bombers.</p>
      <p>Alone this arrest shows Turkey's continued commitment to fighting against ISIL as the Turkish army had neutralized more than 3,000 jihadist terrorists through cross-border operations in the Syrian territories, the minister recalled.</p>
