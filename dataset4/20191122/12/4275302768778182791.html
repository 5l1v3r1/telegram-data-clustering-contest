      <p>The Lions think so – he’s still the last Scot to start a Test for the select side, and he played six in a row, in South Africa in 1997 and Australia in 2001.</p>
      <p>Out of Rannoch School in Perthshire, he played for Dundee HSFP among other clubs before going professional, winning 61 caps for Scotland – and he would have had a great many more but for injuries.</p>
      <p>He followed in the tradition of great looseheads, following Hughie McLeod, Ian McLauchlan and David Sole, all of whom also wore the No 1 dark blue shirt and propped for the Lions.</p>
      <p>But Smith’s always been something of a throwback – unfailingly modest, quite clearly loathing even the dimmest form of limelight, who preferred to let his actions speak for him.</p>
      <p>Which makes his decision to <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk-world/1025510/former-scotland-captain-tom-smith-fighting-colorectal-cancer/">go public with his condition</a> surprising, yet wholly in character. He clearly wants to warn others not to be as stoic as he has been, to check themselves and catch potential problems early.</p>
      <p>That is Tom Smith. As those who played with him will tell you, the ultimate team-mate.</p>
