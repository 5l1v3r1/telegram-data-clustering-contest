        <b>Brighton boss Graham Potter has given Leeds a huge lift by declaring that Ben White will not have his loan spell cut short.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reports emerged on Thursday that both Liverpool and Manchester United were ready to make a move for the 22-year-old, who has so far played a pivotal role in trying to get <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/leeds-united"><b>Leeds</b></a> back into the Premier League.</p>
      <p>However, Potter has <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/liverpool-man-utd-told-that-impressive-leeds-loan-star-is-not-for-sale"><b>ruled out the sale of the centre-back</b></a> and said he is happy for White to see out the season at Leeds before deciding whether he is ready for Brighton’s first team.</p>
      <p>“He’s having a good time at Leeds, so we’ll assess at the end of the season to see what the best thing is going forward,” said Potter.</p>
      <p>“Unless there is a real push for it we won’t call him back. He’s having a positive time at Leeds and we are well covered in that position. So, we’ll carry on with that process I think.</p>

      <p>“As a coaching team we were aware of him when I was at Swansea, we were one of the clubs who would have tried to get him on loan if I was still there. So I know his quality.</p>
      <p>“He had a loan spell at Newport and we tracked his progress for quite some time. He’s a player we like. If you see the way he plays, he’s a player who fits our way. We want to see him playing for Brighton in future.”</p>
