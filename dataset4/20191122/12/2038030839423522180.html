      <p>Cape Town - Move over Chuck Norris, there’s a new sheriff in town.</p>
      <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey<b> </b>recently got candid about his life-threatening encounter with a brown snake in Australia in the 1980s, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1095616/matthew-mcconaughey-reveals-near-death-encounter-with-a-venomous-snake"><b>E! News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>During an interview on the <a href="https://9now.nine.com.au/today/matthew-mcconaugheys-close-encounter-with-dangerous-aussie-animal/1e6779f6-7036-439a-a923-8bff6baa2cf5"><b>Today Show</b></a>, the actor, who was an exchange student at the time, revealed how he was almost bitten by the snake considered to be one of the most venomous reptiles.</p>
      <p>The Oscar-winner was going into the back garden at a friend’s house when the incident occurred.</p>
      <p>"It was a bit dark and just as I opened it [the gate], I saw it went right through my legs and it gave me a bit of a scare," he recalled.</p>
      <p>"And then my friend came over and they caught it and they said, 'That's a brown snake, mate. That could have really sucked.'"</p>
      <p>Despite his narrow escape, the <i>Dallas Buyers Club</i> star still considers the brown snake to be his favourite animal, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7708687/Matthew-McConaughey-reveals-nearly-DIED-brown-snake-encounter.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"That's my favourite animal because it didn't bite me."</p>
