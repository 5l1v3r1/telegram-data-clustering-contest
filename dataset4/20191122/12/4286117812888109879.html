      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Anu Malik stepped down as Indian Idol 11 judge on November 21.</li>
        <li>The music composer said that he hasn't quit but is taking a break.</li>

      <p>Music composer Anu Malik had to step down as a judge from Sony TV's music reality show Indian Idol 11 after social media backlash. The music director was accused of sexual harassment by singers Sona Mohapatra, Neha Bhasin and Shweta Pandit.</p>
      <p>After Anu Malik quitting Indian Idol 11 went viral on social media, Anu Malik spoke to a few entertainment dailies and said that he has not quit the music reality show but is taking a break for three weeks and will come back after his name is cleared.</p>
      <p>However, looks Anu Malik won't be back on Indian Idol anytime soon. On Friday, a source at Sony TV said that Anu Malik is not coming back and will soon be replaced on the show, just like he was last year. Last year, singer Javed Ali has replaced Anu Malik on Indian Idol 11 after he was ousted over #MeToo allegations.</p>
      <p>Singer Sona Mohapatra, who had been constantly tweeting against Anu Malik being reinstated as a judge on Indian Idol, called it a symbolic victory. She said that Sony TV took a long time do this but she is happy that Anu Malik finally stepped down from the show.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Sona Mohapatra had addressed an open letter to Smriti Irani, Union Women and Child Development Minister, where she wrote how Sony TV ignored testimonies of multiple women against Anu Malik, and reinstated him as a judge on Indian Idol 11. After the letter, the National Commission for Women sent a notice Sony TV and shared the notice on their official Twitter page.</p>
