      <h1>Avengers: Endgame Writers Drop a Hot Take on Your Captain America Theories</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:11:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Berek Bigos</a></address>
      <p>With the conclusion of <a href="http://cbr.com/tag/avengers-4"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> seeing Captain America travel back in time to live happily-ever-after with Peggy Carter (after he returned the Infinity Stones, of course), fans have been debating how Cap's journey may have impacted the Marvel Cinematic Universe's timeline. The writers for the film, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, recently projected their perspectives on the many timeline theories.</p>
      <p>When asked by <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">Vanity Fair</a> if the star-spangled Avenger currently lives in the MCU's main timeline or an alternative one, Markus commented, "Those are unsatisfied questions. Those are intrigued questions. I’m delighted at people still chewing over this thing. You know," stated the writer, "If [someone says] 'That’s stupid and I don’t like it and I’m talking about it because it was dumb,' that’s one thing. But if it’s, 'I honestly don’t know, and it’s kind of cool to think about,' that’s great."</p>
