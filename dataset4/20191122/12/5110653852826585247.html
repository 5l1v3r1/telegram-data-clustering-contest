      <h3>How long will J.J. Watt be out?</h3>
      <p>J.J Watt is out for the rest of 2019.</p>
      <p>After bringing down Raiders running back Josh Jacobs behind the line of scrimmage in the second quarter of Houston's 27-24 win over Oakland in Week 8, Watt showed discomfort in his left shoulder and eventually ran to the locker room.</p>
      <p>He was initially considered questionable to return to the game but was later downgraded to out. He tweeted about the news that night and received season-ending surgery two days later.</p>

      <h3>J.J. Watt injury history and timeline</h3>
      <p>When he's on the field, Watt is one of the most ferocious players in the league. But in recent years, he's struggled mightily to stay healthy.</p>
      <p><b>2015 season:</b> Watt didn't miss a game in 2015, so it's unclear what exact injuries he picked up and when, but by the end of the year he required surgery due to "<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/15104588/houston-texans-de-jj-watt-played-5-torn-muscles">five partially or fully torn muscles in his torso, groin and upper legs</a>." He had also played through a herniated disk and a broken hand. Watt did leave the Texans' playoff loss in the second half.</p>

      <p><b>September 2016:</b> After playing in the first three games of the season, Watt re-aggravates the herniated disk and goes under the knife again, ending his season. He later <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/houston-texans-jj-watt-back-surgery-injury-cleared-elongated-career-020117">says</a> he should have taken the initial recovery process slower, but that the second injury could end up prolonging his career.</p>
