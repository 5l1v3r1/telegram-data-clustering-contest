      <h3>What are they saying?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Frank Lampard revealed he sent Jose Mourinho a good-luck message ahead of the Portuguese boss taking charge of Tottenham for the first time:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We had a couple of messages just to wish him well in his new role as he has always done for me. "I think history and results speak for themselves; the trophies, titles he's managed to win at clubs, they are not surprises, they are for the hard work he's put in. He's done that consistently. "Everywhere you go it's a new beginning, I don't think you can rely on that. "But people will hold up his record and expect big things from him."</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Lampard has insisted he will never follow Mourinho's lead and manage Tottenham:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"I can firmly say no, and you can replay that again in 10 years. "It wouldn't happen but I think things are different for me. "I was here for 13 years as a player and have an absolutely deep feeling for a club. "Chelsea is certainly so close to my heart hence why I am so proud to manage the club and why I wouldn't manage Tottenham. "That's no disrespect to anyone, it's just because of what Chelsea has given me over my time as a player and now, it's certainly not on my list."</blockquote>
      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Manchester City - 2/5</li>
        <li>Draw - 4/1</li>
        <li>Chelsea - 6/1</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Chelsea are flying high, winning their last five Premier League games, and Man City are coming off the back of a 3-1 loss to title rivals Liverpool. But, as impressive as Chelsea have been, City are a different beast altogether, especially at home.<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Manchester City 3 Chelsea 1.</p>
