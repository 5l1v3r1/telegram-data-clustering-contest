      <p>How I Succeeded is a regular series on Lifehacker where we ask business leaders for the secrets and tactics behind their success. Today: Natalie Nguyen, co-founder and CEO, Hyper Anna.</p>
      <p><b>Current gig: </b>Co-founder and CEO, Hyper Anna</p>
      <p><b>Current location: </b>Sydney, Australia</p>
      <p><b>Current mobile device: </b>iPhone X</p>
      <p><b>Current computer: </b>Apple’s smallest Macbook. I like things to be as compact as possible.</p>
      <p><b>One word that best describes how you work: </b>Efficient.</p>
      <h3>What apps/software/tools can't you live without?</h3>
      <p>I do most of my work on my phone and iPad. Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive and Slack are the apps I can’t live without.</p>
      <h3>Which social network do you find the most useful?</h3>
      <p>Reddit and Quora. I use Reddit for entertainment and to follow the news in a less-filtered way. I use Quora to get answers to specific questions.</p>
      <h3>What were the most important lessons you learned while growing your business?</h3>
      <p>Don’t underestimate the importance of hiring the right talent. Avoid hiring staff if there’s any doubt about their capabilities, objectives but most importantly passion. It’s best to be absolutely sure that new employees and colleagues have the business’ best interests in mind and are sure to complement its growth journey. As a general rule, I always try to hire people who are smarter than me.</p>
      <h3>What has been the most surprising part of your business journey?</h3>
      <p>You don’t need to be an extrovert to be good at growing a business. Introverts, like myself, are just as able to form quality connections, relationships and partnerships in the tech, startup and business scene.</p>
      <h3>What everyday thing are you better at than anyone else?</h3>
      <p>I’m a good problem-solver, and can think on my feet to find answers quickly. Starting and running a business is a ripe environment for daily challenges, so quick decision making is essential.</p>
      <h3>What's your sleep routine like?</h3>
      <p>It’s proven that sleeping with our fur babies can help us relax and sleep better. I have a seven-year-old Frenchie who provides an unlimited amount of cuddles.</p>
      <h3>What advice would you offer to other businesses on how to succeed?</h3>
      <p>Businesses should define success on their own terms. It’s important to avoid comparing your company’s growth to others’ successes, because success looks different for different people. Business founders, managers, and leaders should also look to surround themselves with smart, experienced, and like-minded people who they can learn from; this is imperative for success.</p>
