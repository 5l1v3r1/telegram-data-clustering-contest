        <b>OMOYELE Sowore, the Publisher of Sahara Reporters has filed a legal suit against the Department of State Service over his arrest and continuous detention since August 3, demanding payment of N500 million from the DSS for illegal violation of fundamental rights.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The suit marked FHC/ABJ /C51409/2019 and dated November 20 was supported by a 21-paragraph affidavit with respondents named as DSS and Abubakar Malami (SAN), Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, according to <b><a href="http://saharareporters.com/2019/11/22/breaking-sowore-files-fundamental-rights-enforcement-application-demands-n500m-damages">SaharaReporters</a></b>. </p>
      <p>“A declaration that the detention of the applicant from November 7, 2019 till date in violation of the order for his release made on November 6, 2019 is illegal as it violates his fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Section 35 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and Article 6 of African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (Ratification and Enforcement Act (CAP A10) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004,” it read partly.</p>

      <p>As aggravated damages for the illegal violation of Sowore’s fundamental right to life, the dignity of his person, fair hearing, health, freedom of movement and freedom of association; the suit included a request from the court compelling the respondents to pay N500 million</p>
      <p>Sowore also asked the court to restrain DSS from further violation of his rights.</p>
      <p>“An order of perpetual injunction restraining the respondents from further violating the applicant’s fundamental rights in any manner whatsoever and however without lawful justification.”</p>
      <p>Today makes it 112 days Sowore has spent in DSS detention since the arrest on August 3 for convening a Revolution Now campaign. The Federal High Court had <b><a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/court-orders-sowore-release-pending-n100-million-bail-fulfillment/">granted</a></b> him bail. Sowore after <a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/sowore-co-defendant-meet-bail-conditions/">fulfilling</a> the bail conditions was yet to be released from DSS detention.</p>
