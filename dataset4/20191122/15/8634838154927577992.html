        <b>Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday, November 21, recognised a Kenyan doctor by awarding her for exemplary work.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr Stellah Wairimu Bosire-Otieno was handed the Commonwealth Points of Light Award, which recognises outstanding volunteers and people who are making a change in their community.</p>
      <p>Wairimu was recognised for her work through the Dr Stellah Bosire Foundation, which has supported over 20,000 women and girls living in poverty to access education programmes, mentoring, work experience and reproductive and sexual health advice.</p>

      <p>Herself being a survivor of sexual violence, homelessness and drug addiction, she took it upon herself to mentor hundreds of women who find themselves in similar circumstances.</p>
      <p>She was born and brought up in Kibera, the largest slum in Nairobi and had a tough childhood, with her mother suffering from schizophrenia and a distant father. </p>
      <p>Stellah is also the co-executive director of UHAI-EASHRI, Africa’s first indigenous fund supporting nearly 200 civil society activist organisations which address issues of sexuality, health and human rights in East Africa.</p>
      <p>Over and above that,  the medical doctor serves as the executive director of the Kenya Medical Association (KMA).</p>
      <p>She overcame all the troubles of her childhood to rise to the top by attending State House Girls High School and The University of Nairobi. UK High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott OBE was full of praise for her.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted that Dr Stellah Bosire has been named as Kenya’s Points of Light Award winner. Her tireless championing of sexual and reproductive health and rights, mentorship of some of society’s most vulnerable people and support for civil society organising in East and Central Africa are fully deserving of this recognition and acclaim.</p>
      <p>"I hope Dr Bosire’s shining example inspires citizens from across the Commonwealth and beyond to volunteer their skills, knowledge and experience in support of others. Many congratulations to her,” Marriot expressed.</p>
      <p>In March 2019, Stellah rejected an offer by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to fill the then-vacant position of Health CEC. </p>
      <p>It seemed imminent that she was going to be appointed to the post but she failed to show up for vetting before the Nairobi County Assembly Committee.</p>
