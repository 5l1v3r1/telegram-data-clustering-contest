      </p>
      <p>An Edo State High Court has directed that Barr. Anselm Ojezua be recognised as State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo state.</p>
      <p>It granted an order of interim injunction directing that the status quo as at 10th of November, 2019 with regards to the chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress bê maintained.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Justice O. Oviawe said the status quo be maintained pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice praying for an order of interlocutors injunction.</p>
      <p>Justice O Oviawe granted the order in the suit filed by Anselm Ojezua, Kenneth Asekhema and Dr. Aisosa Amadasun.</p>
      <p>Defendants in the suit are Col. David Imuse (rtd) Lawrence Okah and Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu.</p>
      <p>Ojezua was last week removed from office after eleven out of the 16 member State Working Committee signed a removal notice on him as state chairman of the party.</p>
      <p>However, three out of the eleven members have denounced their signatories on the document.</p>
      <p>In the suit, Ojezua sought for interim injunction directing that the status quo as at 10th November 2019 with regards to the chairmanship of the All Progressive Congress, Edo State chapter, be maintained by the parties.</p>
      <p>Deriving ruling, Justice Oviawe said, “I have come to a determination that this application for an order of interim injunction finds merit.</p>
      <p>“I am satisfied that there is a substantial issue to be tried at the hearing. In line with the authorities and being satisfied as to the urgency of this application, the application is hereby granted as prayed.</p>
      <p>“Accordingly, an order of interim injunction is hereby granted directing that the status quo as at 10/11/19 with regards to the chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress, Edo State chapter, be maintained pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice praying for an order of interlocutory injunction.”</p>
      <p>Justice Oviawe adjourned till Thursday, December 5th, 2019 for hearing and determination of the motion for interlocutory injunction.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the Ojezua who was present at the APC NEC meeting in Abuja was allowed entry based on the court ruling.</p>
