      <p>The Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna on Friday affirmed the election of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State.</p>
      <p>The five-man panel of Appeal Court Judges led by Justice Tijjani Abubakar unanimously ruled that, the appeal filled by Abba Kabiru Yusuf and his party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) lacks merit.</p>
      <p>They, therefore, dismissed the appeal in its entirety and affirmed that, Governor Ganduje was elected by the majority of Kano voters.</p>
