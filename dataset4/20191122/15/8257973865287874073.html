      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Jerry Sandusky, the former Pennsylvania State University assistant <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Walker/?tps=1">football</a> coach who was convicted in 2012 for sexually abusing 10 boys, was resentenced Friday to at least 30 years in state prison.</p>
      <p>The case, which led to the Penn State's football team being stripped of scholarships and banned from bowl games for several years, designated the longtime coach as a violent sexual predator.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://fox43.com/2019/11/22/jerry-sandusky-to-get-new-sentence-on-45-child-sex-abuse-charges-today/">initially was sentenced</a> to 30 to 60 years in prison on 45 counts, but an appeals court in Pennsylvania ruled the sentencing unconstitutional. A <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Superior_Court/?tps=1">Superior Court</a> also ruled in February the mandatory minimums in the case were not properly applied.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Forest County Judge Maureen Skerda issued a maximum sentence of <a href="https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn-state/jerry-sandusky/article236914393.html">60 years again,</a> the same penalty he got in 2012. Sandusky received credit for 2,712 days served.</p>
      <p>"I apologize that I'm unable to admit remorse for something I didn't do," <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/jerry-sandusky-resentencing-penn-state-football-prison-20191122.html">Sandusky told the judge</a> before she announced her decision. He added later: "No matter what, nobody or nothing will be able to take away what's in my heart."</p>
      <p>Sandusky maintains he is innocent of the charges. His attorney Al Lindsay said he is still hoping for a new trial to exonerate his client.</p>
      <p>The Penn State football program has re-emergence after crippling NCAA sanctions from Sandusky's case. The 9-1 Nittany Lions, ranked No. 9 in the latest polls, play No. 2 Ohio State (10-0) Saturday with an outside shot at entering the national championship playoff picture.</p>
