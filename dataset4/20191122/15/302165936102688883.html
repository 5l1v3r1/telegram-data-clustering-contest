      <p>LONDON, Nov 22 — Netflix has dismissed as “pure speculation” media reports that British actress Imelda Staunton would portray Queen Elizabeth in future seasons of <i>The Crown</i>, saying it was filming the fourth series and had yet to commission future instalments.</p>
      <p>Several outlets today quoted a <i>Daily Mail</i> report saying the 63-year-old screen and stage actress had been “approached by senior producers and casting directors” from the hit show to portray the British monarch from her mid-60s.</p>
      <p>Oscar winner Olivia Colman made her debut in season three of the show on Sunday, where a new cast picks up the story about the British royal family from the mid-1960s.</p>
      <p>Actress Claire Foy won a Golden Globe for portraying the younger version of Elizabeth in the first two series that began with the princess ascending the throne aged 25 in 1952.</p>
      <p>“We are currently filming season 4 of <i>The Crown</i> but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation,” a Netflix spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>Colman will continue playing Elizabeth in the fourth series of the show alongside actress Helena Bonham Carter, who portrays Elizabeth’s younger sister Princess Margaret.</p>
      <p>Staunton is a veteran theatre, television and film actress, known for her Oscar-nominated role in <i>Vera Drake</i>, playing Dolores Umbridge in the <i>Harry Potter</i> films and taking to the West End stage for musicals like <i>Gypsy</i> and <i>Guys and Dolls</i>.</p>
      <p>The actress will star in the musical <i>Hello, Dolly!</i> next year, producers of the West End show said today. — Reuters</p>
