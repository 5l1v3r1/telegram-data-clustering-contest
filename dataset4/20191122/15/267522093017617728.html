      <h1>Here's the best Black Friday speaker deal already: Naim Mu-so special edition and Mu-so Qb prices hacked by up to £200</h1>
      <h2>Some of the best wireless speakers you can buy are reduced to clear</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:10:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">T3 Online</a></address>
      <p>The original Naim Mu-so redefined the wireless speaker market, not least by making it more expensive than it had ever been. But while the Mu-so 2 upped the ante by being even better <i>and</i> even pricier, you can now get your hands on the original for just £695 – a massive £200 off the original RRP – at <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/black-friday/c6000670128?intcmp=ic_20191122_blackfridayhub_he_blf_">John Lewis &amp; Partners</a>. How's that for a <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-black-friday-deals-uk-2019-live-now-amazon-currys-john-lewis-ao">Black Friday deal</a>?</p>
      <p>The JL&amp;P-exclusive 'special edition' is the same price, although don't get too excited, as it's the exact same thing but in a Champagne gold finish, while the more compact Mu-so Qb is now £495, which is a saving of precisely £154.</p>

      <p>Naim Mu-so deals have been rare since its launch but we predicted that the arrival of the generation 2 Mu-so would change that… and now it has. With AirPlay 2 and DLNA/ UPnP, as well as support for Spotify Connect and Tidal built in, the Mu-so is a versatile beast. Via optical digital and USB inputs it can also handle hi-res audio files, but the reason the Mu-so has been such a success is that it offers fantastic sound quality almost regardless of the source. MP3 sounds excellent, while Tidal's CD quality tracks sound stunning.</p>

At £695, it's a bargain. You will need a decent sized sideboard or shelf to accommodate Naim's wireless speaker – it's 63cm long. Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, and DLNA/UpNP. Web radio and support for Tidal are built into the excellent Naim streaming app.<br/><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/naim-audio-mu-so-wireless-bluetooth-music-system-with-apple-airplay-spotify-connect-tidal-compatibility-a-grade-refurbished/p4189648">VIEW DEAL</a></p>

It has all the same connectivity as the full-size Mu-so, but is considerably easier to fit into smaller spaces. Sound quality is excellent – some users might struggle to detect much of a difference between this and its big brother.<br/><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/naim-audio-mu-so-qb-wireless-bluetooth-music-system-with-apple-airplay-spotify-connect-tidal-compatibility/p2525336">VIEW DEAL</a></p>
