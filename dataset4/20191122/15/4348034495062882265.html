      <p>This morning (November 22), Alchemist and Action Bronson released their collaborative EP, <i>Lamb Over Rice</i>. The MC and producer battery regularly work together on television. However, the genesis of the bond has been on heralded mixtapes like 2012’s <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2012/11/action-bronson-alchemist-rare-chandeliers-mixtape/"><i>Rare Chandeliers</i></a>, which is getting a special limited-edition vinyl re-release. The whimsical bars over dusty samples sound as good at the close of the 2010s as they did at the top. At just seven songs and 20 minutes, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3BPX4x5EQOd9vzpPC2rMrm?si=MTmh_ZuySDGX1AxQgVJ1xw"><i>Lamb Over Rice</i></a> (embedded below as a playlist) offers a quick and substantial meal with plenty of sauce.</p>
      <p>Opener “DMTri” is a highlight. With some Euro-Jazz vibes, Action sounds happy, revived, and ready to do damage. “<i>Back with a vengeance / Black MAC lookin’ like Janet, with extensions / I’m back doin’ bench-presses / Put the Audi in a red dress / Make 10 lefts / I lost 50 on the Mets / After practice, hit the steps, b*tch / It’s what I gotta do to be the best,</i>” he raps, spitting in a stream of consciousness. “<i>I think I’m back in the placenta / But then I woke up in a Nissan Sentra / In the parking lot of Queens Center</i>” he spits over the perfect groove from the Gangrene co-founder, before making a makeshift bridge about his grandparents learning English from watching <i>Martin</i>, and honoring Slick Rick.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Just The Way It Is” is another gem. With a crescendo loop that feels like it’s out of an ’80s “buddy comedy” film score, Action gets busy. “<i>At least I’m famous and I ain’t sh*t / Well, my mother loves me; I’m her ba-by / We still drive each other cray-zy / My man needs a liver, bought it off of eBay / He started snorting Pepsi, now he got a fiend’s face / I pre-game before the pre-game / I let my chicken go, give her free range / This is Jericho, no Jheri curl / Put the pedal to the metal, make the Chevy twirl.</i>” Action blends personal rhymes with inventive imagery about cars, sports, and activities. For an artist who has brought his lifestyle to television, it’s a blurry line between dreams and reality.</p>
      <p>This collection of songs is mixed by mid-1990s Gang Starr engineer Eddie Sancho. One year ago, ALC partnered with Freddie Gibbs and Curren$y for <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/10/currensy-freddie-gibbs-alchemist-fetti-full-album-stream-audio/"><i>FETTI</i></a>. In 2019, he released <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/09/alchemist-yacht-rock-2-album-stream-video/"><i>Yacht Rock 2</i></a>, which features Bronson, Roc Marciano, Gangrene, and the Griselda family. In late 2018, Bam Bam dropped <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/11/action-bronson-white-bronco-full-album-stream-audio/"><i>White Bronco</i></a>.</p>
