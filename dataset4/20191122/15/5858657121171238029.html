      <p>VICTORIA (NEWS 1130) — Newly unsealed court documents <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/rcmp-investigation-at-the-b-c-legislature-zeroes-in-on-purchase-of-now-infamous-wood-splitter">obtained by PostMedia</a> show former Clerk of the B.C. Legislature Craig James is under investigation for breach of trust.</p>
      <p>His purchase of a wood splitter is the focus of an RCMP probe prompting his suspension last year, according to PostMedia.</p>
      <p>No charges have been recommended, but the heavily-redacted documents reportedly show he’s accused of buying the equipment for personal use.</p>
      <p>The wood splitter was removed from his home under police supervision, along with other equipment, and Mounties spoke with witnesses who say it was never used at the legislature.</p>

      <p>James resigned in May of 2019 following the release of a report which found he improperly accepted retirement benefits amounting to almost $260,000.</p>
      <p>Both James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz were <a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/2018/11/20/b-c-legislature-staff-placed-on-leave-pending-investigation/">suspended with pay in November</a> of 2018 after they were accused of lavish spending on the public’s dime. Both denied the accusations at the time, calling the situation inaccurate and illogical.</p>
      <p>Retired judge Beverly McLachlin conducted an independent investigation earlier this year into whether misconduct had taken place, <a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/2019/05/16/report-finds-b-c-legislature-official-craig-james-engaged-in-misconduct/">and found it had</a>. She found James engaged in misconduct, made expense claims for improper purchases, and removed and used legislative property.</p>
      <p>Lenz, however was cleared. He resigned in October, 2019.</p>
      <p>Both men, who occupied the most powerful non-elected posts in the provincial government, have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
