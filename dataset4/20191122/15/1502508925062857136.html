      <h1>Maharashtra govt formation talks inconclusive, to continue on Sat: Patel</h1>
      <h2>Pawar and Thackeray were also part of the three-party deliberations at Nehru Centre</h2>

      <p>Talks on government formation in Maharashtra between the Congress, the NCP and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>are inconclusive and will continue on Saturday as well, AICC General Secretary <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ahmed-patel">Ahmed Patel </a>said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Talking to reporters after marathon deliberations between top leaders of the three parties which are inching closer to formation of the new government, Patel said discussions will continue on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan, who attended the meeting at Nehru Centre, said the discussion between the three partners was conducted in a positive manner and they have reached many conclusions.</p>
      <p>"The talks will continue tomorrow. The discussion between the Congress and the NCP concluded in New Delhi yesterday and reached an agreement on common position.</p>
      <p>"The discussion with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>was held today and will continue tomorrow as well," Chavan said.</p>
      <p>Asked about NCP president Sharad Pawar's statement that Sena chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uddhav-thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray </a>will lead the three-party government, Chavan evaded a direct reply and said, "Whatever he has said is on record."<br/><br/>Pawar and Thackeray were also part of the three-party deliberations at Nehru Centre.</p>
      <p>Speaking separately, NCP leader Praful Patel also said the talks on government formation will continue on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Eknath Shinde, Subhash Desai, Sanjay Raut (all Shiv Sena), Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, K C Venugopal, Avinash Pande, Balasaheb Thorat, Chavan (Congress), Praful Patel, Jayant Patil and Ajit Pawar (NCP) took part in the meeting.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, shortly after the meeting at Nehru Centre, Thackeray met party colleagues Sanjay Raut and Subhash Desai at the Mayor's bungalow in Shivaji Park. Thackeray's MLA-son Aaditya was also present.</p>
      <p>The state has been facing a political crisis after the Sena broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>The BJP and the Sena, which fought the Assembly polls in alliance, had secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats, respectively, in the 288-member Assembly.</p>
      <p>The NCP and the Congress, pre-poll allies, won 54 and 44 seats, respectively.</p>
      <p>The combined tally of the Sena, the NCP and the Congress is way beyond the majority mark of 145.</p>
      <p>The state is currently under President's rule.</p>
