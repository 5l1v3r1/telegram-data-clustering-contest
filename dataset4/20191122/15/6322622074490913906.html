      <p>Additionally, a new CEO Regulation position is established to lead the regulatory leadership team in driving the frontline regulatory functions of the Exchange, it added.</p>
      <p>“The organisational restructuring will make Bursa Malaysia into a more agile and efficient organisation, better able to meet the changing needs of customers and stakeholders in a fast-evolving global market,” said the stock exchange’s CEO Datuk Muhamad Umar Swift.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the board and management of Bursa Malaysia, I would like to thank our colleagues for the support and contributions during their tenure with the organisation,” he added.</p>
