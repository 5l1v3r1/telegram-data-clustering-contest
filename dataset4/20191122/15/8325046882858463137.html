      <p>Tesla unveiled its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">Cybertruck pickup truck</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>During the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested that the vehicle’s window glass was stronger than that of a typical car. But two windows on the vehicle cracked when Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s head of design, threw a metal ball at them.</p>
      <p>Here’s how Musk reacted to the Cybertruck’s glass cracking:</p>
      <p>“Oh my f—ing god,” Musk said after von Holzhausen’s first throw.</p>
      <p>Musk then said the throw might have been too hard and laughed, saying that, at the very least, the ball didn’t go through the window.</p>
      <p>“Eh, not bad. Room for improvement,” Musk joked after the second throw, which cracked the window next to the first one.</p>
      <p>Musk said Tesla had thrown wrenches and even a sink at the glass used for the Cybertruck without breaking it, and he joked that the company would fix the video of the event in postproduction.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to begin production of the Cybertruck, which starts at $39,900, in late 2021. The vehicle’s most expensive trim, which starts at $69,900, will have a maximum range of over 500 miles, a maximum towing capacity of over 14,000 pounds, and the ability to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in under 2.9 seconds, Tesla says.</p>
