      <h1>Trump Mocks Fox News Hosts for Claiming Ignorance of Whistleblower</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump ridiculed Fox News hosts after they claimed Friday in an interview with the president they did not know the identity of the so-called “whistleblower” who kicked off the impeachment investigation.</h2>

      <p>In an exchange with <i>Fox &amp; Friends,</i> Trump said he knew exactly who the whistleblower was and looked forward to hearing him testify to the Senate impeachment trial if the Democrats actually voted to impeach him.</p>
      <p>Later in the interview, co-host Steve Doocy clarified the network’s position on the whistleblower’s identity.</p>
      <p>“Let me just interrupt for a second, Mr. President, you said we know the whistleblower, we’ve seen names on the internet, we have no idea who the whistleblower is,” Doocy said.</p>
      <p>“Right,” co-host Brian Kilmeade added.</p>
      <p>Trump replied immediately, “No, I don’t believe, Steve…”</p>
      <p>As Doocy protested, Trump continued, “I don’t think that Steve has ever told a lie — Ainsley, Brian — in his life but that one I’m sort of thinking…”</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen names online, but Mr. President, we don’t have any verification,” Doocy replied.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, and it doesn’t matter anyway, we’re not going to use it,” Kilmeade added.</p>
      <p>“Forget the verification,” Trump replied, “you know exactly who it is … but I like that you say that.”</p>
