      <p>When Marlon Coronado turned up at his wife’s north Richmond office unexpectedly on Thursday lunchtime and asked to speak to her privately outside, she feared the worst.</p>
      <p>But Ronalyn Coronado’s concerns that something bad had happened to their 13-year-old daughter evaporated the second her husband pulled out a lottery ticket and scanned it against an app on his phone.</p>
      <p>The message on the phone read, “You’ve won $1 million and a free play.”</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe it,” said 38-year-old Ronalyn.</p>
      <p>“I went back into the office and asked my manager if I could have a half day. I just said it was a family emergency. I almost cried, but it was too surreal.”</p>
      <p>Marlon, who celebrated his 36<sup>th</sup> birthday on Tuesday, won BCLC’s Lotto 6/49 $1 million Guaranteed Prize Draw on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I’m very happy,” he told the Richmond News on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“But I have to keep my blood pressure down, as I’m diabetic.”</p>
      <p>Marlon, who works as a night audit at a local hotel, said he only checked the ticket on the app around 1 p.m. today, while at home alone, with the family dog, Martial.</p>
      <p>“I checked the barcode several times. I did cry a bit,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I calmed myself down and went to the car to drive to my wife’s office nearby on Viking Way.”</p>
      <p>The couple, originally from the Philippines, are going to stash their $1 million into a savings account for now, to give them time to process the win.</p>
      <p>But a trip back home to see Ronalyn’s sick dad is high on the agenda, as well as buying a family home in Richmond.</p>
