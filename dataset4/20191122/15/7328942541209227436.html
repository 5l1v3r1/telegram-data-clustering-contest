      <p>Their new generation 3D pens make use of a variety of thermoplastic materials that provide an enormous range of possibilities for 3D fanatics. </p>
      <p>"Drawing with this pen is just a pleasure. It melts plastic evenly and that what makes it easier creating beautiful and neat drawings. My favorite part of this new device is a variety of materials that you can use with it. A drawing mat that goes in the set is also an excellent base you can use for drawing with your 3D pen." - <a href="https://penandplastic.com/3d-simo-mini/">penandplastic.com</a>. </p>
      <p>Their series of intuitive 3D pens are specifically designed to help make the process of designing and creating 3D objects as simple as possible. 3D Simo's series of products are designed to replace an entire suite of tools to enable amateurs and professionals to bring their 3D creations to the next level.</p>

      <h3>What can you do with 3D Simo's pens?</h3>
      <p>As we have already highlighted, 3D Simo pens have been designed for a variety of tasks all in one device. While their primary function enables a user to 3D draw and print in a single step, with attachments they can do a lot more.</p>

      <p>"It gives you the possibility to decorate old shoes, leather jackets or even wooden furniture which have become bored off. Remember, the longer you apply heat to the surface, the darker it will become." - <a href="https://penandplastic.com/3d-simo-mini/">penandplastic.com</a>.</p>
      <p>You can also solder with their specialized soldering tool. It works just as well as a purpose-built soldering iron and allows you to melt the solder and complete electrical connections with ease. </p>
      <p>You can also use the soldering tool to make last-minute adjustments to your 3D plastic sculptures by melting and remolding the plastic. </p>
