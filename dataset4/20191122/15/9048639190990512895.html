      <p><b>BATON ROUGE, La. (WVUE) - </b>The Louisiana Department of Health is reporting that a second person has died from complications related to vaping.</p>
      <p>This is the second vaping-related death in Louisiana this week with the first death being confirmed Monday.</p>
      <p>So far there have been 32 cases of lung injuries reported between August of 2019 until now.</p>
      <p>The State Health Department has blamed three chemicals for an outbreak in lung illness cases with Vitamin E acetate being considered the main culprit. Vitamin E acetate serves as a thickening agent for the oil used in some e-cigarettes.</p>
