      <h1>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep ability trees in the Solar subclass are being reworked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:49:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>Next Season, Bungie will rework several Destiny 2 ability trees in the Solar subclasses.</p>
      <p>Bungie will apply updates to Solar subclass abilities next season, and like Arc and Void, the combat team will be revisiting some older subclass paths to “freshen them up a bit.”</p>
      <p>After looking over some of the data, the team found that three specific subclasses were “underperforming” an in need of a rework. These Solar subclasses are Gunslinger, Sunbreaker, and Dawnblade.</p>
      <p>With Gunslinger: Way of the Sharpshooter, the team wants to make it to where this bottom path is chosen more often for more activities other than PvE.</p>
      <p>In order to differentiate both Golden Gun paths and make Sharpshooter more versatile, it will make the following changes: for 3-shot auto-aim distance and reliability when aiming down sights will be increased. For 6-shot, damage falloff range will be shortened to “emphasize the short-range gunfighter role with a lot of kill potential.”</p>
      <p>Then there’s Weighted Knife which will be a high-damage knife throw which will travel at high speeds, bounces once, and does extra damage to the head. Precision shot final blows recharge the melee completely and will have a one-hit precision final blow in PvP.</p>
      <p>Practice Makes Perfect will also last longer but it will give the player less energy per second. Precision hits will grant two stacks.</p>

      <p>For Titans, changes coming to Sunbreaker will make it more competitive in PvP when using the middle path Code of the Devastator.</p>
      <p>The Roaring Flame perk will receive a “significant buff” to its bonus damage, and the buff now lasts 25% longer, making it easier to build and retain stacks between encounters. Throwing Hammer’s melee ability will be increased and with Roaring Flames active in PvP it will be much more lethal.</p>
      <p>Burning Maul will last longer, the Throwing Hammer will have increased impact damage from 100 to 120 and an increased hammer pick-up radius will move from 2m to 3.5m. Roaring Flames will also see its damage bonus increased in PvP.</p>
      <p>With Dawnblade top path Attunement of Sky, Icarus Dashes while in Daybreak will have increased speed and thrust. The new Celestial Fire will send a spiral of three explosive Solar projectiles, and the rework of Heat Rises will consume your grenade to extend Glide time and reduce the in-air accuracy penalties for weapons.</p>
      <p>Other changes are coming to each subclass, and if you <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48462">hit up the Bungie Weekly Update</a>, you can learn more about the changes.</p>
      <p>The next season for Destiny 2: Shadowkeep will start in roughly two weeks or so.</p>
