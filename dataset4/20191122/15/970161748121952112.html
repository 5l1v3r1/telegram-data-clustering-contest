      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has admitted that he waited until the end of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> to start experimenting with drugs.</p>
      <p>The Lights Up singer revealed that he feared drug taking would mess things up during his time in the hugely popular boyband, and with the group <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2015/08/23/theyre-on-a-break-one-direction-to-go-on-extended-hiatus-next-year-5357343/">taking a hiatus</a> at the beginning of 2016, he claims that this was the ‘time in his life’ to finally begin experimenting.</p>
      <p>‘When I was in the band, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us I felt, I’m not going to be the one who f***s it up,’ he told Zane Lowe. ‘So I was like, now is the time in my life when you probably go out and experiment.’</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old later confessed to taking the hallucinogenic drug magic mushrooms, which he experimented with while recording for his upcoming second studio album, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/harry-styles-amps-one-direction-chart-battle-announces-new-album-fine-line-11041647/">Fine Line</a>, at the famous Shangri-La studios in Malibu.</p>

      <p>‘Making this record felt like, I just felt so much more joyous and I was with my friends and we were in Malibu. I felt so safe,’ he explained.</p>
      <p>‘It was like, I want to take some mushrooms, now is the time to have fun. We’re in Malibu, I’m also in music.’</p>
      <p>Harry also previously opened up about his ‘fond memories’ of his drug-taking experiences in Malibu to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-cover-interview-album-871568/">Rolling Stone.</a></p>

      <p>‘We’d do mushrooms, lie down on the grass, and listen to Paul McCartney’s Ram in the sunshine,’ he said. ‘We’d just turn the speakers into the yard.’</p>
      <p>As he later pointed to where he took the magic mushrooms, he recalled: ‘This is where I was standing when we were doing mushrooms and I bit off the tip of my tongue.</p>
      <p>‘So I was trying to sing with all this blood gushing out of my mouth. So many fond memories, this place.’</p>
