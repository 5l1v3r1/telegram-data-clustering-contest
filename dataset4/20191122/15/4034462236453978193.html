      <h1>Bugatti Boss Reveals His Perfect Chiron</h1>
      <h2>This is what Stephan Winkelmannâ€™s ideal Bugatti would look like.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:05:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>From the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bugatti/chiron">Chiron </a>and the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bugatti/divo">Divo</a> to the one-off <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/one-off-bugatti-la-voiture-noire-is-a-12-million-masterpiece">La Voiture Noire</a> and the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/presenting-the-1600-hp-bugatti-centodieci">Centodieci</a> inspired by the EB110, Bugatti builds some of the most striking-looking cars on the planet. At the 2019 LA Auto Show, Bugatti's president Stephan Winkelmann revealed to us that the company's wealthy customers <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/average-bugatti-buyer-spends-over-300000-on-options">spend over $300,000 euros on options </a>on average when configuring their cars. No, that doesn't include the base price of the car or taxes. With this in mind, we asked the Bugatti president how he would configure his ideal Bugatti.</p>

      <p>"I like matte colors, so I would choose white or black," said Winkellman. "I would have black rims with the red brake calipers." As for the interior, the Bugatti president would configure his car with a brown or black cabin. "If it's brown, the stitching should be the same. If it's black, maybe with red stitching," he told us.</p>
      <p>Using Winkellman's description, we were able to render the president's perfect Bugatti based on the Chiron Sport. We're used to seeing Bugatti Chirons configured in two-tone finishes, but Winkellman takes a more subtle approach with a sleek all-black or all-white exterior, no exposed carbon fiber, and a refined interior. It's discrete compared to other<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/jamie-foxx-shows-off-his-gold-bugatti-veyron"> eye-catching Bugattis owned by celebrities</a>, but the resulting design look very stylish.</p>

      <p>Like all Chiron Sport models, power would be sourced from an 8.0-liter quad-turbo W16 producing 1,479 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p>
      <p>As standard, the Chiron is available with seven color combinations, including light blue and white with carbon fiber, exposed red carbon fiber and white, exposed blue carbon fiber, black and yellow with carbon fiber, dark blue and light blue, red and black with carbon fiber and exposed carbon fiber with champagne. However, the personalization options are virtually limitless.</p>
