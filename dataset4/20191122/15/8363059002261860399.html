      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:20:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>New customers to BT TV and those upgrading their existing package get six months of Amazon Prime video for free.</p>
      <p>The service is also getting Alexa voice control for hands-free searching to find your favourite films and TV shows. And to make things even more convenient, you'll get just a single bill that's inclusive of the Prime Video subscription cost. When you actually start paying for it, that is.</p>
      <p>Existing BT TV customers who don't want to upgrade and are happy as is, can try out Prime Video for 30 days for free. To take advantage of the offer, you can't have an existing Prime Video account.</p>
      <p>Sports lovers will benefit from the offer, what with the 20 exclusive Premier League matches Prime Video has snagged, including 10 games between December 3 and 5, and an additional 10 Boxing Day and the day afterwards. And that's on top of the slew of content already on the service, including the upcoming <i>Star Trek: Picard</i>, debuting within the free six month period, on January 24.</p>
