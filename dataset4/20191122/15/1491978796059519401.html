        <i>IU Bloomington says its hand are tied: ‘We cannot fire Professor Rasmusen – the first amendment of the constitution forbids us’</i>
      </p>
      <p>An economics professor at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/indiana">Indiana</a> University Bloomington has published a number of extremely racist, homophobic and sexist tweets – and yet the university has put out a statement saying it cannot penalize or fire him for doing so.</p>
      <p>“Professor Eric Rasmusen has, for many years, used his private social media accounts to disseminate his racist, sexist, and homophobic views,” read <a href="https://provost.indiana.edu/statements/index.html">the statement</a> from the university’s provost, Lauren Robel. “We cannot, nor would we, fire Professor Rasmusen for his posts as a private citizen, as vile and stupid as they are, because the first amendment of the United States constitution forbids us to do so. That is not a close call.”</p>
      <p>Rasmusen’s tweets include an article retweeted on 7 November titled “Are women destroying academia? Probably”. Rasmusen quoted a comment from the article that focused on the intellectual superiority of men: “Geniuses are overwhelmingly male because they combine higher outlier IQ with moderately low agreeableness and conscientiousness.”</p>

      <p>Since outrage over his tweets began on Thursday night, Rasmusen has tweeted an article focusing on the economic benefits of slavery.</p>
      <p>In 2003, he wrote a blogpost in which he claimed gay men are more likely to molest students; that they “are generally promiscuous”; and are not suited for “moral exemplar” professions such as teaching and preaching.</p>
      <p>Reacting to complaints, the university decried Rasmusen’s bigoted stances and said it was bringing in a set of measures it claims will protect students who might be “reasonably be concerned that someone with Professor Rasmusen’s expressed prejudices and biases would not give them a fair shake in his classes”.</p>
      <p>These include allowing students to opt out of Rasmusen’s classes; providing alternative classes by other faculty members; requiring double-blind grading on all of Rasmusen’s students’ assignments; and having other staff check Rasmusen’s grading in cases where double-blind grading is not possible.</p>
      <p>Rasmusen responded to what he called the <a href="http://www.rasmusen.org/special/2019kerfuffle/">“Twitter kerfuffle”</a> by saying Robel has a “wrong view” on his opinions. In his statement, he defended calling women “sluts” with the line: “Is ‘slut’ a slur against women? Not at all. It is a slur against certain women, against a minority of women, and for them it is a justified slur, a descriptive one.”</p>
      <p>Rasmusen also quoted his pastor, who allegedly once said to him: “Eric, I want you to be persecuted, but I want you to be persecuted for being a Christian, too, and not just for being a conservative.”</p>
      <p>The university statement said: “Sometimes Professor Rasmusen explains his views as animated by his Christian faith, although Christ was neither a bigot nor did he use slurs; indeed, he counseled avoiding judgments.”</p>
      <p>The controversy doesn’t seem to have upset Rasmusen, who claims it has been good for his Twitter following: “The number of my Twitter followers has risen from less than 400 to 833 from November 18th to 21st.”</p>
      <p>Rasmusen has also posted some encouraging emails to his website. One says: “Do not let the thought police shut you down. The leftwing media always tries to skew the truth. Keep fighting the fight for critical thinking!”</p>
