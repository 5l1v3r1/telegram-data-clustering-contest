      <p>“Around five months ago we played each other in <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> final and now he is on holiday, and I hope he can enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“He did a brilliant job at <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/tottenham">Tottenham</a>, nobody doubts that hes an outstanding coach, great guy, left and right of the games, I really enjoy the games we played against each other.</p>
      <p>“My first game in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> was against him so we have quite a history together, but everyone knows that pretty much all the jobs that are available or not available Mauricio will be in contention.</p>
      <p>“It was a big one, when I heard it first I couldn’t really believe it in that moment, but then a couple of hours later they already had a solution, and that’s how it is.</p>
