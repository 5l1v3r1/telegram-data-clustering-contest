      <p>The Always Sunny gang will return to Netflix next January.</p>
      <p>Just days after the record-equalling season ended in the US - <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/always-sunny-philadelphia-star-glenn-howerton-names-eight-favourite-episodes-338651"><i>Always Sunny</i></a> is now one of the longest-running comedy shows of all time - Netflix have confirmed that Mac, Frank, Dennis, Dee, and Charlie will be breaking in the new year in style.</p>
      <p>Season 14 of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/always-sunny-philadelphia-star-glenn-howerton-names-eight-favourite-episodes-338651"><i>Always Sunny</i></a> arrives on Netflix on January 19, 2020.</p>

      <p>The good news doesn't appear to be stopping there, however, as earlier this year, FX CEO John Landgraf said: "As long as we can come to business terms that fit both our needs and they can continue to make episodes as good as they have been making, there is a good chance it may go past season 14".</p>
