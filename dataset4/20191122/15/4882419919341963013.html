      <h1>Right-back shortage sees Dani Morer train with Barça pre-Leganes</h1>
      <h2>The Barceloma B right-back is having a cracking season in the third division</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:32:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">German Bona</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona B right-back Dani Morer trained with the first team on Friday ahead of this weekend's trip to Leganes in La Liga.</p>
      <p>Ansu Fati, Carles Perez and goalkeeper Sergi Puig were also involved in the session as Ernesto Valverde prepared for the return of domestic football following the international break.</p>
      <p>Morer has been called up due to a full-back shortage. Nelson Semedo is injured and Sergi Roberto is suspended on the right side, while Jordi Alba's injured on the left.</p>
      <p>Junior Firpo is likely to keep his place in Alba's absence, while Moussa Wague could make his first appearance of the season for the club.</p>
      <p>Right-back Morer is likely to make the squad as cover in the full-back positions having impressed for the B team in Segunda B this season.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde, though, also suggested that he could change the system to make up for missing so many full-backs for the game in Madrid.</p>
