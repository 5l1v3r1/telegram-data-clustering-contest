      <h2>Fancy pouring yourself a glass of wine made from your very own Welsh grapes?</h2>

      <p>Imagine you are hosting a party at your home and suddenly realise you are running out of wine and the nearest shop is miles away.</p>
      <p>Not a problem if you are lucky enough to be the owner of this lovely mansion near <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/monmouth">Monmouth</a> as it has its very own vineyard in the garden.</p>

      <p>But this is no single vine, amateur operation.</p>
      <p>Ancre Hill Estate is a multi award-winning Welsh vineyard that produces wine that is enjoyed across the globe, with the estate being recognised by some of the major international wine competitions.</p>
      <p>Arguably the pinnacle of the estate's success so far was in 2012, when its 2008 sparkling wine won the Bollicine del Mondo for the best sparkling wine in the world.</p>
      <p>The brand and business is well established, with on-site facilities including a cellar, a converted stable block used for customer wine tasting events and, of course, a state-of-the-art, fully-equipped winery.</p>
      <p>Oh, and outside there are grapes. Lots of grapes.</p>

        <figcaption>In total the estate is over 137 acres of land, 29.5 dedicated to the vines<cite>(Image: Savills)</cite></figcaption>

      </figure>
      <p>The estate in its entirety, including a complete farmstead, covers about 137.1 acres, 29.5 acres of which is dedicated to the vines on the south-facing slopes.</p>
      <p>There is also a substantial cider orchard within the grounds.</p>
      <p>The estate can also boast using traditional biodynamic and organic practices following a holistic, ecological and ethical approach.</p>
      <p>According to the vineyard's website, the acreage of vines at the estate are inspected every year by Demeter, the largest certification organisation for biodynamic agriculture, to ensure all cultural practices go beyond organic standards in line with the full biodynamic accreditation achieved in 2014.</p>

      <p>But at the heart of the business is a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/incredible-property-renovation-transformed-dingy-17130981">beautiful home</a> .</p>
      <p>In fact, there are so many properties and outbuildings that make up the estate, it could be described as being its own little hamlet.</p>
      <p>There's the main house, which is a three-storey, double fronted mansion that overlooks the lawn garden and vineyard beyond, plus three other cottages.</p>
      <p>The attractive red stone facade and painted side-wing of the main <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/beautifully-restored-old-vicarage-pembrokeshire-17082876">period property</a> are just the beginning of the distinctive original features and classic decor of this impressive home.</p>
      <p>The stained glass porch that also boasts Minton floor tiles begins the journey through the mansion, which has original fireplaces, large sash windows, sanded floors, picture rails and coving that combine to give the home a feeling of grandeur.</p>

        <figcaption>Mainly neutral decor throughout<cite>(Image: Savills)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Colours throughout are predominantly neutral, accent colours are rich in tone, patterns are traditional and furniture is predominantly antique or classic in style.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of moments of sparkle though, with classic chandeliers and ornate metallic gold mirror frames being the shiny stars of the interiors show.</p>
      <p>The kitchen diner is a space where a more <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/interior-design">contemporary style</a> is in attendance, with the kitchen units a vibrant shade of teal.</p>

        <figcaption>Modern additions are classic in design<cite>(Image: Savills)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Fixtures and fittings are classic and tasteful and as age appropriate to the style of the home as possible, including the roll-top bath and the column radiators.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/interior-design">interior design</a> scheme in some of the bedrooms has been given a slightly more modern style, predominantly through the use of 'on-trend' colours such as slate grey and heritage blue.</p>
      <p>In total, the main house has five reception rooms, including one dedicated to snooker, plus the large kitchen/diner that leads into a sunny conservatory.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On the first floor the master bedroom has an ensuite and walk-in dressing room.</p>
      <p>There are three further bedrooms on this level, one with an ensuite, plus two family bathrooms.</p>
      <p>On the second floor can be found the final two bedrooms that have feature exposed beams, with the ceiling raised to the roof. Both of these loft bedrooms have an ensuite.</p>

        <figcaption>One of the extra, separate cottages that comes with the estate<cite>(Image: Savills)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Then there's the three cottages that could all potentially be used as <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/beautiful-pembrokeshire-house-comes-beach-17222355">holiday lets</a> if planning consent already exists or can be secured.</p>
      <p>There's a cute two bed, a spacious three bed, plus a four bedroom property which is actually the recently refurbished former Newton Court Farm farmhouse, which now makes up part of the overall estate.</p>
      <p>And when a new owner is not picking, squashing or bottling grapes, picking apples or greeting holiday guests, there's plenty to do at the estate.</p>
      <p>In the grounds there is an outdoor <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/ordinary-looking-homes-come-surprise-17199304">swimming pool</a> surrounded by swaying palm trees that looks like a scene from a posh south of France villa.</p>
      <p>When not relaxing by the pool, sipping a glass of wine of course, there's a tennis court for the owner to enjoy and a pretty garden surrounding the mansion to attend to and enjoy wandering around.</p>

        <figcaption>Anyone for tennis?<cite>(Image: Savills)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Of course, a ride-on tractor is a must so there's a dedicated shed for it to sleep in, plus a range of garages for machinery and equipment.</p>
      <p>The estate comes with a separate office so work and life are physically separated, with maybe the shortest and prettiest commute to work in the region.</p>
      <p>And if time off from the grapes is required, as the stunning panoramic views suggest, the estate is surrounded by beautiful Welsh countryside enticing an owner out of the gates for country hiking and water based activities.</p>
