      <h1>Former Villanova campus ministry official gets 78 months in child porn case</h1>

      <p>A former campus ministry official at Villanova University who pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography has been sentenced to more than six years in prison — a punishment he admitted he deserves.</p>
      <p>Timothy O’Connell, the onetime associate director of campus ministry at the private Catholic university in Pennsylvania, was sentenced Thursday to 78 months in a federal lockup and 10 years of post-release supervision, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/villanova-chaplain-timothy-oconnell-child-pornography-guilty-federal-court-20191121.html">the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.</a></p>
      <p>O’Connell, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/12/villanova-campus-ministry-official-charged-with-child-porn/">suspended by Villanova and barred from campus</a> following his July 2018 arrest, told a judge he was “disgusted” by his behavior prior to sentencing.</p>
      <p>“I stand before you today filled with remorse and deep shame,” the 52-year-old Drexel Hill man told the judge while admitting that he acquired child porn over the internet. “I deserve to be right where I am.”</p>
      <p>An FBI investigation into Justyn Perez-Colon, a now-convicted child pornographer, led authorities to O’Connell, who confessed to using the Kik app to receive explicit images of children as young as 18 months old from Perez-Colon, the Inquirer reported.</p>
      <p>A search of Perez-Colon’s iPhone led detectives to O’Connell via a Gmail account that he accessed at his home and inside his office at Villanova, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>O’Connell later admitted to FBI investigators that he was sexually attracted to a third-grade girl he knew and admitted to looking at child porn on the internet, Philadelphia Magazine <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2019/06/12/villanova-tim-oconnell-child-porn/">reported in June</a>.</p>
      <p>O’Connell’s attorney sought leniency from a judge, suggesting a prison sentence of five years. He said the former ministry official had pleaded guilty and has become a model jail inmate by working as a suicide-prevention counselor and teaching English to others behind bars.</p>
      <p>The judge was unmoved, however, calling him O’Connell a “danger to society” as he ordered the former Villanova official to pay more than $10,000 in fines and register as a sex offender upon his release.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, these cases are extremely difficult,” Judge Gerald Pappert said. “The subject matter is heartbreaking. It’s hard to understand how things get to this point.”</p>
      <p>Prior to his time at Villanova, O’Connell worked in Hispanic ministry outreach for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>A message seeking comment from Villanova officials was not immediately returned early Friday.</p>
