      <h1>Stroke patients in South Bristol able to rehabilitate at home thanks to electric bikes</h1>
      <h2>More than 300 patients have benefited from the scheme since April 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:16:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ella Buxton</a></address>
      <p>Three hundred stroke patients in South Bristol have been able to have rehabilitation therapy at home since electric bikes were introduced for staff.</p>
      <p>Therapists at South Bristol Community Hospital (SBCH) in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hengrove">Hengrove</a> are using the bikes to carry out home visits for stroke patients who have recently been discharged from hospital.</p>
      <p>The scheme, which started in 2017, means patients don’t need to stay in hospital for longer than necessary.</p>
      <p>The Early Supported Discharge Team for Stroke (EDS) is run by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/university-hospitals-bristol-nhs-foundation-trust">University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust</a> and supports patients across the city, with team members visiting up to four patients a day.</p>
      <p>Patient Darren Batchelor, 46, suffered two strokes in July and praises the ESD team after they provided support for him in his home in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hartcliffe">Hartcliffe</a>.</p>
      <p>After spending a number of weeks in hospital, including around a month at SBCH, Darren was able to go home once he built up a level of strength.</p>

      <p>Once discharged, the ESD team visited him up to twice a day for four weeks and assisted him with speech therapy, consistently checked his blood pressure, provided therapy on his arms and legs and helped him with his exercises.</p>
      <p>He said: “They also listened to how I was feeling which was brilliant and really supportive. They were very helpful and it was very good to be able to have this in my own home.</p>
      <p>“They helped to set me up with a very positive outlook on my recovery. I don’t know where I would be without their support.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of appreciation for them.”</p>
      <p>Since the scheme began in 2017, the team have also worked to tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>The scheme was initially a trial, but won an NUS Green Impact Award in 2017 and now, the bikes have travelled nearly 3,000 miles in two years.</p>
      <p>James Barber, therapy technician, is a keen cyclist and said: “Since the introduction of the e bikes all members of the ESD team have benefited from shorter journey times and reduced stress due to avoiding traffic.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to be out in the fresh air and it’s a really great sustainable way of seeing our patients. The electric bikes mean we’re putting fewer cars on road journeys around Bristol, which reduces traffic and is better for the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/environment">environment.</a>  It has also saved the Trust significant travel and parking expenses.”</p>
