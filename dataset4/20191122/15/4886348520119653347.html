      <ul>
        <li>Resident Evil 2 remake was very successful for Capcom.</li>
        <li>Resident Evil 3 Remake is apparently coming out in 2020.</li>
        <li>I think Resident Evil 3 Remake is going to be even better than RE 2 was.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The recent remake of Resident Evil 2 has seen overwhelmingly positive reviews since its January 2019 launch and is a strong game of the year contender. The game was already a fan favorite so that positivity was maybe to be expected. Well, thanks to that reception, it looks like we’re going to be getting a remake of Resident Evil 3 too.</p>

      <p>It may well have been a sure thing to many but it’s nice to see more grounded reasoning behind it. When it comes out in 2020, Resident Evil 3 Remake is going to be even better than RE 2 was.</p>

      <h3>Resident Evil 3 was Always a Better Game</h3>
      <p>That might be tough to swallow for many people. After all, RE 2 was a fan favorite highlight of the series. Obviously which game you think was the best is a subjective decision, so you might agree or disagree. Allow me to try and justify my belief in Resident Evil 3 as the superior game.</p>
      <p>It all starts out with the main villain. Tyrant, or to give it the proper, nerdy title <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/T-00">Tyrant T103 – T-00</a>, is a great villain. He appears on several occasions to pursue the player when it seems like they’re doing too well. Nemesis, full title <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Nemesis-T_Type/gameplay">Nemesis T-Type</a>, is a similar animal. He chases the player to bother them frequently. The only difference is that Nemesis basically has a rocket launcher.</p>
      <p>This might be untrue for you depending on how you think about it, But Nemesis just seems scarier than Tyrant. He has that deep voice thing going for him, wields a massive rocket launcher and isn’t sporting that goofy rain-mack-and-fedora look. I know the fedora is a new addition for the remake but that just makes it worse. It’s all well and good trying to do a callback to an earlier design, but come on Capcom he looks goofy as hell.</p>

      <h3>It Also Has Less Retreading of the Same Ground</h3>
      <p>Another major reason that I think Resident Evil 3 is better is that it doesn’t force you to play basically the same game twice. RE 2’s Leon and Claire campaigns are great and all, but their campaigns aren’t all that different. They split off occasionally and there are obviously story differences but they tend to explore the same areas.</p>
      <p>At least in Resident Evil 3 you only have to explore each area once. You might have to do multiple playthroughs to get all the secrets, but it’s better than doing a second playthrough of <b>two </b>campaigns you’ve already done. Plus in RE 3 you don’t have to play as Sherry which is all plus as far as I’m concerned. Forced stealth needs to go away and so does escort missions involving children.</p>
      <p>Resident Evil 3 is all about a badass character exploring a zombie-infested city. No need to protect a child or sneak around. Just you, your wits and a grotesque monster trying to blow you to kingdom come.</p>
      <p>Personally, I can’t wait for Resident Evil 3 Remake to come out. Let’s face it, it can’t be worse than that <a href="https://www.ccn.com/resident-evil-choose-your-own-adventure-for-halloween-is-no-treat/">terrible choose-your-own-adventure game</a>. Just as long as Capcom doesn’t put a goofy sombrero on Nemesis.</p>
