      <h1>AUD/USD: Improving trade sentiment supporting the aussie – CIBC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:23:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/matias-salord" target="_blank">Matías Salord</a></address>
      <p>Analysts at CIBC, expect the AUD/USD pair to trade at 0.71 during the first quarter of next year and at 0.74 during the third quarter. </p>
      <h3>Key Quotes: </h3>
      <p>“The key driver of the AUD over the past month has been global trade <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a>, specifically pertaining to the USChina negotiations. The November RBA meeting was largely a non-event, with rates left unchanged. Growth and inflation forecasts were revised higher, supported by an outlook including lower rates, increased fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending, and tax cuts.”</p>
      <p>“Consumer spending remains lacklustre, despite the recovery in housing prices since the start of the year. Wage growth also continues to pose a challenge, despite a relatively tight labour market. This will likely remain a key focal point for the RBA moving forward. The market is currently pricing in the possibility of a rate cut mid next year, but only with a 55% probability. Developments in the labour market concerning full employment and wages will likely swing central bank expectations.”</p>
      <p>“With the market anticipating a ‘Phase One’ deal by the end of the year, we believe that sentiment will ultimately provide support for the AUD in the near-term. Still, we expect the currency to lag its peers, such as the NZD.”</p>
