      <p>Obrafour has finally broken his silence on the numerous allegations levelled against him by his close friend, Yaw Labito.</p>
      <p>Yaw Labito who is a longtime friend of the Ghanaian rap legend in an interview with Sammy levelled a lot of allegations against Obrafour.</p>
      <p>According to Labito, Obrafour after featuring him on his popular ‘Odo’ song, <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/obrafours-old-friend-yaw-labito-fights-him-over-his-popular-odo-song/">neglected him during the video shoot.</a></p>
      <p>A situation which he finds very disrespecting even up to date. In his numerous allegations, he also revealed how<a href="https://www.ghbase.com/my-uk-visa-expired-because-obrafour-refused-to-help-me-with-my-locked-up-cash-yaw-labito-shares-sad-experince-with-obrafour/"> Obrafour intentionally hijacked his travelling plans</a> back in the days and <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/i-helped-obrafour-with-back-to-taifa-concert-but-he-betrayed-me-during-pae-mu-ka-concert-yaw-labito-spills-more-secrets/">also betrayed him during his recent ‘Pae Mu Ka at 20’ concert.</a></p>
      <p>Reacting to these allegations by Yaw Labito on Zylofon FM, Obrafour revealed that he was the one who paid for Labito’s album which was recorded by Zapp Mallet and even looked for someone to buy the album at a cost of GHC7,000 but Yaw went behind his back to collect GHC1,000 without his knowledge.</p>
      <p>He also responded to Labito’s allegation that he hijacked his travelling plans. According to Obrafour, after securing a UK visa for Labito to perform at a show, he went behind his back to one man in his area to help him get a plane ticket and that Obraofur will be the one to pay for it.</p>
      <p>He was informed of Labito’s move by the man and asked him to use the GHC1,000 he’s acquired to fund for his plane ticket and that was what created the initial enmity between them.</p>
      <p>Speaking on neglecting Labito during ‘Odo’ video shoot, Obraofur noted that it was the concept and decision of the director and with that, he can’t say much about that.</p>
      <p>He also touched on why he wasn’t called to perform ‘Odo’ with him at the ‘Pae Mu Ka’ concert. According to Obrafour, Bisa Kdei asked to perform the whole song but Obrafur insisted he sings the chorus so he does the verses and that was why he(Labito) was missing in action.</p>
      <p>Ending his phone-in conversation with Sammy Flex, he urged Labito to take the matter to court if he feels cheated in some way.</p>
