      <p>The government is working on an integrated gold policy, which is expected to be released soon, a senior <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/finance-ministry">finance ministry </a>official said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The policy is aimed at promoting growth of the yellow metal industry and exports of jewellery.</p>
      <p>Niti Aayog has submitted a detailed report on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold-policy">gold policy </a>and it is being examined, Joint Secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs Surinder Pal Singh said at an event here.</p>
      <p>"Government is definitely looking into it. Definitely there will be a gold policy," he said.</p>
      <p>The domestic industry has demanded a cut in import duty on gold to 4 per cent from the current 12.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is no <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold-policy">gold policy </a>despite the fact that India is the largest consumer and importer of the precious metal.</p>
      <p>The then finance minister Arun Jaitley had announced formulation of a comprehensive <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold-policy">gold policy </a>to develop the yellow metal as an asset class.</p>
