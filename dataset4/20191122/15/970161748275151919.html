      <p>Ricky Ponting says the current state is ‘not good enough’ after 21 no-balls went uncalled on day two of the opening Test between Australia and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Four front foot no-balls have been called so far in the first Test at the Gabba but footage from Australian sports network 7Sport has highlighted a number of no-balls that went unpunished.</p>
      <p>Pakistan’s teenage debutant Naseem Shah had his maiden Test scalp chalked off for overstepping and former Australia captain Ponting has bemoaned the current approach to calling no-balls.</p>

      <p>He told cricket.com.au: ‘It was exactly the same with the first Test of last summer – Ishant Sharma, I think it was 30-odd for the day or for the innings that he bowled by himself.</p>

      <p>‘They’re just not being called. If you look at some of the footage and stuff that we’ve seen today, it’s not like they’re just over the line or on the line.</p>
      <p>‘There are some that are four or five inches over the front line; it just goes to show – or it says to me – that the umpires aren’t even looking at the front line.’</p>
      <p>The lack of no-ball calls means batting sides are missing out on free runs and extra deliveries, while bowlers are only becoming aware of transgressions when a wicket falls.</p>
      <p>Ponting does not blame the umpires but their superiors for the current state and added: ‘It’s obviously a directive from above for them not to worry so much about the front line and only be more worried about the decisions down that end, but I just don’t think that’s right.</p>
      <p>‘I understand the reason they’re not calling a lot of them. Obviously, if they call a no-ball and a wicket falls that’s shown not to be a no-ball, they can’t change it.</p>
      <p>‘I know they’re under pressure with that and I’m not blaming the umpires at all because if they had it their way, I’m sure they wouldn’t want to be making 21 incorrect decisions a day, which is what they’ve done.</p>

      <p>‘I put it to them on air today; I think they’re marked on every decision that they make.</p>

      <p>‘A no-ball decision is still a decision. If you look at it that way, they’ve made 21 incorrect decisions today and that’s not good enough, as far as I’m concerned.’</p>
      <p>Trent Copeland, who made three Test appearances for Australia, shared a video of the numerous uncalled no-balls on social media and said: ‘This is astonishing. Huge talking point &amp; something the ICC HAS to look at.’</p>
      <p>Australia bowled Pakistan out for 240 in the first Test in Brisbane and had reached 312-1 by the close on day two largely thanks to David Warner’s unbeaten 151.</p>
