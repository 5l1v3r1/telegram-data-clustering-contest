        <li>Getting a college degree is an important step in many careers, but not every occupation that requires a college degree is set to grow.</li>
        <li>Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found 14 jobs that typically require at least a bachelor’s degree that are likely to shrink between 2018 and 2028.</li>
        <li>Reporters topped the list.</li>

      <p>Getting a college degree is an important first step in many careers.</p>
      <p>However, not every occupation that requires a college degree is set to expand in the next several years.</p>
      <p>Every two years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/">employment projections for the United States</a>. These estimate how many people are likely to be employed in various jobs over the next decade.</p>
      <p>The most recently released projections cover how employment is expected to change between 2018 and 2028. The projections also include typical educational requirements for each job. Using those projections, we found the 14 jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher that the BLS projects will have a decline in employment over the decade.</p>
      <p>Here are the jobs, along with their <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">median annual salaries as of May 2018</a>, the most recently available data:</p>
