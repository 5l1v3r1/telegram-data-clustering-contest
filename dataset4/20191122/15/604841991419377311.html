      <p>All-Ireland League side Navan Rugby Football Club have appealed the decision of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) to award a walkover to Highfield arising out of last Saturday's unplayed AIL Div 1B game at Balreask Old.</p>
      <p>Navan had sought a postponement on the same criteria that they had got a postponement of the previous week's game against OLd Wesley (illness - a mumps outbreak).</p>
      <p>Following that first postponement, the IRFU re-fixed that match to Thursday 19th December at 8.00pm. </p>
      <p>The Rugby Committee of the IRFU met last week and directed that after consultation with the HSE East Branch and the IRFU medical department, that Navan RFC should field a team against Highfield.</p>
      <p>"We went back to the IRFU to say that this decision was at odds with our own medical advice which had stipulated a 14-day isolation period for the squads that had potential to be infected from the initial outbreak,"stated a Navan RFC official.</p>
      <p> At this week's Executive Committee meeting at Balreask Old Navan RFC decided to appeal this decision.</p>
