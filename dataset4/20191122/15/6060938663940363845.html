      <p>John Abraham, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ileana-D-Cruz">Ileana D'Cruz</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anil-Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pulkit-Samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Kharbanda">Kriti Kharbanda</a>'s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Pagalpanti'">'Pagalpanti'</a> has been the talk of the town since the announcement. The film team has been promoting the movie on various platforms and today, the film has hit the theatres.</p>
      <p>However, the film has opened to mixed reviews and has taken a poor start which reportedly in the 15% range which is lower than last week's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sidharth-Malhotra">Sidharth Malhotra</a>'s 'Marjaavaan'.</p>
      <p>According to BoxOfficeIndia.com, the film is expected to show better growth than 'Marjaawaan' on Saturday but that will not be enough for the film.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the morning numbers of the film are lower than John's solo release 'Romeo Akbar Walter'.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Disney's '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Frozen-2">Frozen 2</a>' has shown a good opening of 25-30% and will return strong numbers as the Saturday and Sunday crowd will be strong. The report further stated that the occupancy is far better than 'Pagalpanti' but the first day numbers could out to be similar to 'Pagalpanti'.</p>
