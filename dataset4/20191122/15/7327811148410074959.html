      <p>JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- A suspect is charged in the death of 17-year-old <a href="https://abc7ny.com/suspect-sought-after-teen-found-fatally-stabbed-on-nyc-sidewalk/5701377/">Talasia Cuffie</a>, whose body was found in Queens last week.</p>
      <p>Tyler Caldwell, 20, is charged with conspiracy and criminal facilitation.</p>
      <p>Cuffie was Aamir Griffin's godsister. Griffin, 14, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/funeral-held-for-14-year-old-killed-on-queens-basketball-court/5670309/">was shot by a stray bullet while playing basketball last month in Jamaica</a>.</p>
      <p>Friends say the teen was at Griffin's home with his family after a celebration of his life, went out to get something to eat and never came back.</p>
      <p>Cuffie was then found on a sidewalk on 166th Street in South Jamaica with multiple stab wounds in the torso and the chest. Police say there were signs of a struggle.</p>
      <p>Cuffie was transported to Jamaica Hospital where she was pronounced dead. She lived on Vernon Boulevard in Queens.</p>
      <p>Other arrests are also expected. Her death does not appear to be linked to that fatal shooting.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, there is a vigil and march scheduled for her Friday night.</p>
