      <p>The Red Devils earned a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/man-utd-vs-brighton-and-hove-albion_game_92619.html">3-1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> last time out as their positive form in other competitions begins to translate into their league showings.</p>
      <p>However, they face a tough test against the Blades, who have defied expectations to go <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">fifth in the league table</a>, producing some impressive showings in the process.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the Red Devils could line up for Sunday's showdown.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite the raft of injuries United manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> has to deal with, it is not likely that the Norwegian will be forced into many changes from the win over Brighton before the international break.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-de-gea/"><b>David de Gea</b></a> will continue in goal, with the first-choice partnership of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-maguire/"><b>Harry Maguire</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/victor-lindelof/"><b>Victor Lindelof</b></a> ahead of him. The injury to Rojo leaves only <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phil-jones/"><b>Phil Jones</b></a> as cover for the starting pair, making it unlikely that Solskjaer would field all three of his fit senior central defenders at once to match the Blades' formation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-wan-bissaka/"><b>Aaron Wan-Bissaka</b></a> should start at right-back, while the impressive showings from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brandon-williams/"><b>Brandon Williams</b></a> could see him keep his starting berth ahead of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ashley-young/"><b>Ashley Young</b></a> on the opposite flank.</p>
      <p>The only major change will come in midfield, with McTominay joining Pogba on the sidelines with an injury and Matic not yet match-fit. Assuming Solskjaer does not rush the Serbian back, youngster <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-garner/"><b>James Garner</b></a> could be handed a rare opportunity in the Premier League alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fred/"><b>Fred</b></a> in a double-pivot.</p>
      <p>Ahead of them, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-pereira/"><b>Andreas Pereira</b></a> will expect to keep his spot ahead of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/juan-mata/"><b>Juan Mata</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jesse-lingard/"><b>Jesse Lingard</b></a> after his goal against the Seagulls, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcus-rashford/"><b>Marcus Rashford</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/anthony-martial/"><b>Anthony Martial</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-james/"><b>Daniel James</b></a> is clearly Solskjaer's preferred front three and should start together again.</p>
