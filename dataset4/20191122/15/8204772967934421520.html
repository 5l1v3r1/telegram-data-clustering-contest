      <p>A man has been jailed for 15 months for making a hoax 999 call claiming there had been a shooting at a pub in an attempt to divert gardaí from trying to remove him from his ex-partner’s home.</p>
      <p>Brian Johnston (32), who has 205 previous convictions, was barred from the Focus Ireland property by management who gave permission to gardaí to breach the door to remove him.</p>
      <p>Dublin Circuit Criminal Court heard that before this could happen, a 999 call came in about a shooting so gardaí and the armed support unit were diverted.</p>
      <p>Five garda vehicles attended at the pub before discovering it was a hoax. Two fire brigade units and an ambulance were also dispatched but diverted before arriving.</p>
      <p>Johnston’s voice was later identified on the call and a mobile found at the house was linked to the call.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel said Johnston had been released from prison shortly before these events and was homeless. He had been living in a car but it was seized by gardaí.</p>
      <p>Johnston, of Moatview Avenue, Priorswood, pleaded guilty to making a false report at a property on Cappagh Road, Finglas on June 20th, 2017.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded guilty to stealing a car battery, producing a hammer while appearing to be about to commit an offence, as well as driving without a licence or insurance at Baldoyle on September 25th, 2018.</p>
      <p>Judge Martin Nolan said Johnston had been in a place he should not have been and wanted to “thin out” the gardaí. He said it was a “reprehensible act” but was a “crime of desperation” on the night. Judge Nolan imposed concurrent sentences totalling 15 months.</p>
