      <p>I’m A Celeb star Myles Stephenson has insisted he never cheated on his ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>During an interview before he entered the jungle, the Rak-Su singer denied Gabby’s claims that he was unfaithful.</p>
      <p>The couple split back in August after almost a year of dating, amid reports she caught him messaging other women.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sun, Myles explained: “We were on a break at the time when I messaged this girl, a previous ex. I shouldn’t have done it, even though me and Gabby weren’t speaking at the time and I moved home, but it was general conversation.”</p>

      <p>“I was a stupid mistake and I stopped speaking to her when we started getting back together, but by that time she’s messaged Gabby and said we’d been speaking.</p>
      <p>“But nothing happened – I didn’t even meet up with her,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Gabby’s a girl girl has a different perspective on things but we were on a break to make ourselves work better.”</p>
      <p>“We were intending to give it another go. I admitted it the moment she pulled me up on it because I loved Gabby and people make bad decisions,” he added.</p>

      <p>It comes after Gabby lashed out at her ex on Instagram earlier this week, after Myles said he struggled to find a meaningful relationship during a conversation with his I’m A Celeb campmates.</p>
      <p>Responding to Myles’ comments on her Instagram Story, Gabby shared a photo of his face photoshopped onto a leopard, and wrote: “OMG I’m dead 🤣 I’m not even watching the show but people are sending me things like this. Saying meet ‘meaningful Milo’.. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣.”</p>

      <p>“Apparently he was on about ‘meaningful relationships’. I’m not sure the guy knows what he’s on about tbh.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I didn’t know cheating, lying and a whole load of other 💩 came under ‘meaningful’. Who knows? Each to their own.”</p>
      <p>The blonde beauty also liked some tweets about her ex, including one that said, “Watching Myles in the jungle chat about trying to find meaningful relationships when I know he did the dirty on my girl @gabbydawnallen.”</p>
