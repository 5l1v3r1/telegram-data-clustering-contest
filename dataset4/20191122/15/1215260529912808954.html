        <b>The Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) is reporting a 15.5 per cent increase in credit extended by deposit-taking institutions to businesses and households for the 12-month period ending September 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Governor, Richard Byles, says this is “broadly consistent” with the level of growth in this area, since the start of the year.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at the Central Bank’s quarterly briefing in downtown Kingston, on Thursday</p>
      <p>“In addition to loans from DTIs, firms have been obtaining financing from the issue of corporate bonds and equity,” he added.</p>
      <p>Byles said the continued buoyant growth in credit results from institutions such as commercial banks, merchant banks and building societies, reducing lending rates on local currency loans.</p>
      <p>This, he added, is consequent on reductions in the BOJ’s policy rate on overnight deposit-taking institutions placements, which have fallen from 3.75 per cent to 0.5 per cent per annum, since June 2017.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Deputy Governor, Dr Wayne Robinson, noted that underlying the overall 15.5 per cent increase in credit is a “healthy” 17 per cent growth in loans to the productive sector, year on year.</p>
      <p>“We are seeing growth… right across a number of sectors [including] manufacturing, construction, distribution [and] professional services… so it’s quite broad-based,” he added.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the BOJ announced its decision to maintain the overnight policy rate unchanged at 0.5 per cent, effective November 20.</p>
