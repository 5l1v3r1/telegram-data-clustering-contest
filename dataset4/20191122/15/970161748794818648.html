      <p>David Tennant has been cast as serial killer Dennis Nilsen for ITV’s new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/true-crime-tv-series-docuseries-documentary/">true crime</a> drama series, Des.</p>
      <p>Des is set to be a three-part series, which focuses on the notorious serial killer who murdered a number of boys and young men from 1978 until 1983, before being convicted on six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
      <p>The series will also take a look at the police investigation into Dennis and his subsequent trial, as well as the media coverage the case received.</p>
      <p>Polly Head, ITV’s Head of Drama, explained: ‘This drama starts with Nilsen’s arrest and is looking at him through the eyes of the police officer trying to identify those he killed and deliver justice for them and the biographer he chose to tell his story.’</p>

      <p>Joining David is Line Of Duty star Daniel Mays, who has been cast as Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay, who was responsible for Dennis’ arrest after investigating his Cranley Gardens home for human fragments blocking the drains.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The Crown’s Jason Watkins is set to star as biographer Brian Masters, who wrote the novel Killing For Company, on which the series is based.</p>
      <p>Polly is also confident with David’s casting as the infamous serial killer, as she hailed him ‘brilliant’, while calling the rest of the cast ‘incredible’.</p>

      <p>‘David Tennant is going to be brilliant as Dennis Nilsen and with Daniel Mays as Jay and Jason Watkins as Brian, this has an incredible cast to bring this story to screen ad we are delighted to be making this with New Pictures for ITV,’ she added.</p>
      <p>Playing the role of a serial killer may sound like an easy task for the former Doctor Who star – after all, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/19/david-tennant-world-away-good-omens-character-netflixs-criminal-new-pics-emerge-10768715/">he recently starred as Dr. Edgar Fallon in the Netflix series Criminal</a>, a character who was accused of sexually assaulting and murdering his teenage stepdaughter.</p>
