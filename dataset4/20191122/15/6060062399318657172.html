      <p>Prepared salads sold at Walmart, Target, Aldi, and other retailers across 22 states have been recalled for possible E. coli contamination. </p>
      <p>Missa Bay, LLC, of Swedesboro, New Jersey, issued the recall after lettuce in a bag of its products tested positive for E. coli, according to the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-115-2019-release">US Department of Agriculture</a>. </p>
      <p>More than 75,000 pounds of product were affected by the recall, which included <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7f4bf949-abbe-4bed-b1c9-9c9760c38c33/rc-115-2019-retail-list.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">35 types</a> of prepared salads such as Good &amp; Gather Chicken Caesar Salad (sold at Target), Signature Café Southwestern Style Salad (sold at Walmart), and Little Salad Bar Santa Fe Style Salad (sold at Aldi). </p>
      <p>Items included in the recall were sold between October 14 and October 16 in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Most of the salads had a "use by" date of between October 31 and November 1. The USDA is urging any customers who still have the salads — even though they are now far past their "use by" date — to throw them away. </p>
      <p>E. coli causes diarrhea and vomiting and can sometimes lead to severe infection, according to the USDA. The infection is typically diagnosed by testing a stool sample. </p>
