      <p>I’m worried about my work colleague. He is working incredibly hard on an emotionally draining project, and I know it’s affecting his health and happiness. He is owed a huge amount of holiday – some of which he will lose if he doesn’t take it soon – but he is so absorbed in the project he’s working on that he says he can’t put it aside. How can I support him, and help convince him it would be best to take some time off?</p>
