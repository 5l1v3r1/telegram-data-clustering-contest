      <p>Ishant Sharma claimed a five-wicket haul as India dismissed Bangladesh for only 106, quickly seizing control at the start of the historic day-night Test at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Having hammered the Tigers in the first match of the series, India appear destined to secure a sweep after they ended a dominant opening day on 174-3, giving them a 68-run lead over their injury-hit opponents.</p>
      <p>Ishant showed a liking for the pink ball, taking 5-22 with support from Umesh Yadav (3-29) and Mohammed Shami (2-36) as the tourists were bowled out in 30.3 overs.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh also required two concussion replacements, with Mehidy Hasan and Taijul Islam replacing Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan respectively after they were struck on the helmet while batting.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli became the first Indian - and only the sixth from any nation - to score 5,000 Test runs as captain, reaching stumps on 59 not out following a gritty 55 from team-mate Cheteshwar Pujara.</p>

      <p>India's lethal pace attack had earlier torn through the Bangladesh batting line-up after Mominul Haque won the toss, Rohit Sharma taking a magnificent slip catch to remove the visiting skipper after Ishant saw off Imrul Kayes.</p>
      <p>Yadav got one to nip back in and bowl Mohammad Mithun for a second-ball duck in the same over that he drew an edge from Mominul. Shami soon got in on the act too, cleaning up Mushfiqur Rahim.</p>
      <p>Liton â€“ one of only three batsmen to reach double figures for Bangladesh - retired hurt after taking a blow from Shami, while Nayeem was hit by the same bowler and although he batted on, the spinner lost his off stump when Ishant produced a peach of a delivery to end a 12-year wait for a five-wicket Test haul on home soil.</p>
      <p>This is a first day-night five-day match with the pink ball for both sides, with India and Bangladesh the ninth and 10th teams to play a Test under the conditions.</p>
      <p>In India's reply, Al-Amin Hossain had first-Test double-centurion Mayank Agarwal (14) caught by Mehidy in the gully and Rohit (21) fell leg before, offering no shot to one from Ebadat Hossain that jagged back in.</p>
      <p>But Pujara and Kohli nudged India in front with a third-wicket stand of 94 after coming together on 43-2, though Ebadat got rid of the former under the floodlights.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh were unable to use the spin of Mehidy given he was not a like-for-like replacement for Liton, who was taken to hospital for a check-up along with Nayeem, meaning Mithun took over wicketkeeping duties.</p>
