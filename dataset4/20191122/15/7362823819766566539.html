      <h1>Trump rips George Conway: ‘Kellyanne is great but she’s married to a total whack job’</h1>

      <p>President Trump called <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-george-conway-marriage">George Conway</a>, the husband of White House senior adviser <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-cnn-wolf-blitzer-husband-embarrassed">Kellyanne Conway</a>, a “nut job” on Friday during a phone interview on “Fox &amp; Friends.”</p>
      <p>Trump was asked about George Conway suggesting that Nikki Haley is fighting to replace Vice President Mike Pence on the 2020 ticket – a claim the president has denied.</p>
      <p>“Kellyanne is great but she’s married to a total whack job,” Trump said. “I don’t even know him. I met him for a second, he’s gotta be some kind of nut job.”</p>

      <p>Trump joked that his senior advisor must have “done some bad things” to her husband over the years for him to behave the way he does.</p>
      <p>“That guy is crazy,” Trump said. “Mike Pence is a great vice president. He’s our man 100 percent.”</p>

      <p>The marriage of Kellyanne and George Conway, who frequently bashes Trump on Twitter, has been a hot topic in the liberal media recently.</p>
      <p>Kellyanne Conway lashed out at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-stelter-jeffrey-epstein-abc">CNN’s Wolf Blitzer</a> last week for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-cnn-wolf-blitzer-husband-embarrassed">implying her marriage</a> has “issues.” She slammed Blitzer when he attempted to get a reaction on her husband’s anti-Trump thoughts, specifically because he began the exchange by awkwardly saying he knows “that there are issues” in their marriage.</p>
      <p>“What did you just say? Did you just say there are issues there? You don’t want to talk about … why did you say that?” Conway asked. “I think you embarrassed yourself.”</p>
