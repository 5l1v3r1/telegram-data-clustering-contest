      <p>Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter are without a doubt one of the most talented siblings in Bollywood. There isn’t much that we need to say about Shahid Kapoor as the actor has proved his worth by delivering some stunning performances in films like Kaminey, Haider and more recently, Kabir Singh. Even though Ishaan has just started his journey in Bollywood, he’s been appreciated in films like Beyond The Clouds (2017) and Dhadak (2018)</p>
      <p>Today, the brothers were spotted by our cameramen after a gym session. While Shahid was spotted wearing a white tee and a pair of black shorts, his brother Ishaan was seen in a two-toned grey hoodie and tracksuits. On the work front, while Shahid will be seen in the Jersey remake, Ishaan will be seen in Mira Nair’s adaptation of Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy. </p>
