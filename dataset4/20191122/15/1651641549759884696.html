      <p>We’ve earlier <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/facebook-messenger-desktop-app/">reported</a> that Facebook is working on some useful new features for its Facebook Beta app for Windows 10. These new features are now rolling out to those who are using the Facebook Beta app on their PC. The new Facebook Beta app update brings the following new features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to permanently delete sent messages</li>
        <li>Introduction of new themes (dark theme, grey theme)</li>
        <li>Ability to send files</li>
        <li>Full-screen mode</li>
        <li>Ability to hide chats</li>
        <li>New icon</li>
        <li>Updated emoticons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It worth noting that Facebook is rolling these new features in a phased manner, meaning not everyone will get the update today. If you don’t get it today, you’ll have to wait a few more days for the update to arrive.</p>
      <p>You can download the Facebook Beta app from Microsoft Store, or you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/messenger-beta/9nblggh2t5jk?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">click here to download the app</a>.</p>
