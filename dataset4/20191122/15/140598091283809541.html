      <p>My grandmother was an exceptional <i>nankhatai </i>maker and I remember her baking these for us as a teatime snack when we got home from school. They were crisp and crumbly with a melt- in-the-mouth texture that made them completely moreish.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>15 minutes, plus chilling time | <b>Cooking time:</b> 20 minutes</p>
      <h3>MAKES </h3>
      <p>15</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>130g plain flour</li>
        <li>60g gram flour</li>
        <li>30g fine semolina</li>
        <li>80g icing sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cardamom</li>
        <li>110g ghee or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>20g mixed pistachios and almonds, crushed or very finely chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas mark 2.</li>
        <li>Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.</li>
        <li>Put the plain flour, gram flour, semolina, icing sugar, cardamom and a large pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and mix well.</li>
        <li>Rub in the ghee or unsalted butter to make a stiff dough. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 15 equal portions each about 3cm in diameter. Shape each portion into a flat, round shape and place on the lined baking tray.</li>
        <li>Press an indent in the top of each round with your finger and fill with chopped nuts. Press them down slightly into the dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until cracks appear on the top of each biscuit.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool. The biscuits will be soft as they come out of the oven, but will crisp up as they cool. When completely cool, store in an airtight container and consume within a week.</li>
      </ol>
