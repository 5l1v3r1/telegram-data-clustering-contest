      <h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Update 1.09 Adds Two Spec Ops Missions</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 22 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>A big update for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare/achievements">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> has rolled out today. There is plenty go over in the patch notes including numerous bug fixes and quality of life improvements. However, the main focal point for achievement hunters here is the addition of two new Spec Ops missions.</p>

      <p>"Harbinger" and "Brimstone" are two new Spec Ops missions that have been added with update 1.09. The "<a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a286538/liberation-achievement">Liberation</a>" achievement requires you to complete all Spec Ops missions. Before the update, there were four missions (HEADHUNTER, KUVULDA, PALADIN and CROSSWIND), and many TA members were unlocking the achievement. Now we have six missions to finish, so potentially these two new Operations have made the achievement considerably harder to unlock. We haven't been able to confirm this in the office, however, and the achievement might still unlock after completing the original four, although this is just speculation. We've reached out to Infinity Ward to clarify.</p>

      <p>Also in the patch notes, the three-star rating system for spec ops is back. Each time you complete a mission, you will now be graded and will receive XP, and multiplayer unlocks, depending on how quickly you can clear each mission. A classic Special Ops mission has also been added (Classic Special Ops missions do not count towards the Liberation achievement).</p>
      <p>For multiplayer, Gun Game has been added and a new Realism playlist for the game modes Domination, Hardpoint, Headquarters and Kill Confirmed.</p>
      <p>Footstep volume has also had another adjustment, a new always sprint option has been added, and the Dead Silence Field Upgrade has also had a fix and now stays active for the correct amount of time.</p>
