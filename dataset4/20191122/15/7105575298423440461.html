        <li>As spotted by <i>Daily Mail</i>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7711447/Pippa-Middleton-wraps-warm-belted-burgundy-coat-takes-son-Arthur-winter-stroll.html">Pippa Middleton stepped out with son Arthur</a> in a gorgeous fall outfit.</li>

        <li>Pippa's been nailing the style game recently, particularly in <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29860262/pippa-middleton-dress-parasnowball-2019/">an Anna Mason gown</a>.</li>

      <p>You know that outfit you're searching for in the cooler fall months? You know, the one that makes you feel polished and chic and warm and layered and perfect? Well, I have come to tell you that this outfit does actually exist, and it was worn by the incredible Pippa Middleton.</p>
      <p>Pippa was out on a walk with her son Arthur, as she often is, in a glorious burgundy wrap coat that's the perfect fall color. She paired it with skinny jeans, white top, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525081&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aspinaloflondon.com%2Fproducts%2Fportobello-bag-in-black-pebble&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Ffashion%2Fa29889890%2Fpippa-middleton-banana-republic-coat-jimmy-choo-sneakers%2F">a black crossbody by Aspinal of London</a>, and white fashion sneakers. BOOMâ€”perfect ideal fall outfit, right there. And yes, it is shoppable.</p>
      <p>According to<i> <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29873551/pippa-middleton-wrap-coat-meghan-markle/">Harper's Bazaar</a></i>, the coat is Banana Republic and still available in gray and tan. I would love the burgundy, but the wrap coat is so in right now that the other colors are still perfect.</p>
      <p><i>Harper's Bazaar</i> also makes the very good point that Meghan Markle also favors this cut of coat quite a bit, so...twinning with Pippa Middleton and the Duchess isn't too shabby, is what I'm saying.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Daily Mail</i>, the shoes are Jimmy Choo and actually have a subtle star print on the sole of the white sneakers, which I find to be gorgeous and a perfect twist on your classic white option.</p>
      <p>Both items are under $300, and what's even better is that Banana Republic has a 40 percent off sale going on right now, making the coat even more affordable.</p>
      <p>Here's the full look, in case you want to twin head to toe:</p>
