      <p>A woman born with 12 fingers and 20 toes has described how neighbours ‘keep away’ from her because they think she’s a witch.</p>
      <p>Kumar Nayak, 63, has lived with the abnormality since birth and has never been able to afford treatment.</p>
      <p>She says others living in the same town of Ganjam, in the Indian state of Odisha, either ‘keep away’ or give her abuse because of her rare condition.</p>
      <p>‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a poor family,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘It has been 63 years I have been in the condition I am today. The residents nearby believe that I am a witch and keep away from me.</p>

      <p>‘But sometimes more visitors come to see my condition. I am forced to stay indoors as I am treated differently.’</p>

      <p>However, one sympathetic neighbour added: ‘I know that she has a medical problem and it has nothing to do with what others believe her to be.</p>
      <p>‘I feel so sorry for her that she cannot even afford to get herself treated.’</p>
