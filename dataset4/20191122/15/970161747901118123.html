      <p>An adorable golden retriever appeared to get incredibly worried while watching Disney favorite Simba’s dad Mufasa die in ‘The Lion King.’</p>
      <p>The footage taken by Sam Stolly shows his one-year-old dog, Khaleesi, nervously watching the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> movie from Stolly’s kitchen before walking up for a better view.</p>
      <p>As the heartbreaking scene unfolds, Khaleesi takes a seat right in front of the screen and does not look away as Simba tries to wake his father up.</p>
      <p>Alongside the video, Stolly wrote: ‘Someone was very concerned.’</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/why-does-my-dog-watch-tv/">American Kennel Society</a>, dogs can recognize action on the television – especially when it depicts another dog, even more so when it’s their breed.</p>
      <p>Even though Simba is a cartoon lion, Khaleesi may be perceiving him as another golden retriever in distress due to his golden yellow fur and white chest.</p>
      <p>Sam shared his footage online, where his empathetic dog’s behavior has since won the hearts of thousands of viewers.</p>
