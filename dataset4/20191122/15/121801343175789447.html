      <h1>Impeachment TV Ratings See Slight Uptick</h1>
      <h2>Over five days, the hearings have averaged 12 million viewers.</h2>

      <p>Five days of impeachment hearings on President Trump's withholding of aid to Ukraine were a steady draw for daytime news viewers.</p>
      <p>The five days averaged 12 million viewers across all the networks that aired them. The first day had the highest viewership of 13.8 million, per Nielsen.</p>
      <p>It fell off for the second and third days before a slight uptick for Thursday and Friday's coverage. To compare, the impeachment average is slightly below the July 24 Robert Mueller hearing (13 million). </p>
      <p>Fox News led as the most viewed outlet, closely followed by MSNBC in the daytime audience race and ahead of CNN and broadcasters ABC, CBS and NBC.</p>
      <p>Nielsen's figures measure in-home viewing; third-party measurement by Tunity Analytics estimates out-of-home viewing over the first three days of hearings averaged an additional 2.3 million more viewers.  </p>
