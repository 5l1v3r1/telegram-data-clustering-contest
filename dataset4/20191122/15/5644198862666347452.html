      <p>KOLKATA, India: Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque won the toss and elected to bat against India at Eden Gardens on Friday in the first day-night test for both teams.</p>
      <p>Visibility of the heavily-lacquered pink ball, especially at twilight, will be a concern for that players in only the 12th day-night test in the game's history.</p>

      <p>"The wicket is dry and hard, that's why we want to bat first," Mominul said after winning the toss for the second and final match in the series.</p>
      <p>The tourists made two changes as they seek to bounce back from their defeat inside three days in the opener.</p>
      <p>Paceman Al-Amin Hossain and off-spinner Nayeem Hasan have come in to replace spin duo Taijul Islam and Mehedy Hasan Miraz.</p>
      <p>India, who need only a draw to record their 12th successive home series victory, fielded the same side that triumphed in Indore.</p>
      <p>"We'd have batted first as well," Kohli said.</p>
      <p>"There's a decent grass cover on it, but it's a hard pitch. With the pink ball there will be something for the first 15 overs.</p>
      <p>"The challenge is to adapt quickly. The ball travels quickly and can slips out of the hand."</p>
      <p>Teams:</p>
      <p>India: Rohit Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha (wicketkeeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh: Shadman Islam, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque(captain), Mohammad Mithun, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Liton Das (wickekeeper), Nayeem Hasan, Abu Jayed, Al-Amin Hossain, Ebadat Hossain.</p>
