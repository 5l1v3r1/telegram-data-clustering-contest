      <p>A LEGAL action over claims that loyalists were interned at the height of the Troubles to "even up the score" will be heard next year.</p>
      <p>More than 20 elderly Protestants are suing the UK, alleging they were imprisoned without trial to balance the number of Catholics being detained.</p>
      <p>A judge listed the lead case for trial in May at the High Court in Belfast.</p>
      <p>The solicitor who represents most of the men taking the lawsuits welcomed the development.</p>
      <p>Kevin Winters said: "Resolution of conflict-related cases has taken an incredibly long time.</p>
      <p>"Many of these people are now in their eighties, so it is important for them that there is some expedition."</p>
      <p>Internment was introduced in 1971 as violence raged. Nearly 2,000, most of them Catholic, were held over the next four years.</p>
      <p>Claims have been brought against the Northern Ireland Office, PSNI, Ministry of Defence and Secretary of State by men from the so-called loyalist community.</p>
      <p>They allege the British government abused its power by locking them up because of their religion, and to demonstrate internment was not just focused on Catholics.</p>
      <p>East Belfast man Jim Wilson's claim has been identified as a lead case.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in July 1973 and interned for 14 months at the Long Kesh prison camp. He previously described how it resulted in him losing his house, job and missing the birth of his first child.</p>
