      <h1>Lawyer Apologises For Disrespectful Language In Jacob Zuma’s Appeal Notice</h1>

      <p>PIETERMARITZBURG – Jacob Zuma’s lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane has apologised for the disrespectful language used in the former president’s appeal notice to the Pietermaritzburg High Court.</p>
      <p>This comes as the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has requested from the court that Zuma should be financially penalised for the tone used in his court papers.</p>
      <p>Sikhakhane has appeared in court on behalf of Zuma, who is applying for leave to appeal a High Court decision that dismissed his permanent stay of prosecution application.</p>
      <p>Sikhakhane has, however, maintained that the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) may overturn the High Court’s decision and Zuma may eventually be granted a permanent stay of prosecution. Last month, he failed to have charges quashed by the Pietermaritzburg High Court.</p>
      <p>Zuma faces charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering linked to the multibillion-rand arms deal.</p>
      <p>He had previously argued in court that the case against him was concocted by his political enemies.</p>
