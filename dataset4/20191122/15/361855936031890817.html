      </p>
      <h4>Aries</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to turn down invitations to family events and catchups with friends if you feel like certain people would only make you more stressed.</p>
      <h4>Taurus</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to feel lonely. You are allowed to wish you had someone to kiss beneath the mistletoe.</p>
      <h4>Gemini</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to be stressed. You are allowed to feel like this season is more overwhelming than merry.</p>
      <h4>Cancer</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to spend money on <i>yourself</i>. You are allowed to get presents for yourself, too.</p>
      <h4>Leo</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to cheat on your diet. You are allowed to treat yourself a little.</p>
      <h4>Virgo</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to save your money. You’re allowed to give loved ones hand-made gifts instead of spending a fortune.</p>
      <h4>Libra</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to skip old traditions if they bring back too many bad memories.</p>
      <h4>Scorpio</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to be upset if you’re missing loved ones who are no longer with you — or even exes who have gone a separate way from you.</p>
      <h4>Sagittarius</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to get excited about the holiday season. Being a kid at heart is a good thing, not something to be embarrassed about.</p>
      <h4>Capricorn</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to be upset around this time of year. It doesn’t make you a grinch. It makes you human.</p>
      <h4>Aquarius</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to take a break from work. You are allowed to let yourself slow down for a change.</p>
      <h4>Pisces</h4>
      <p>You are allowed to do whatever <i>you</i> want during the holidays. You are allowed to make your own traditions.</p>
