      <p><i>Days of our Lives (DOOL</i>), the long-running soap opera is set to be renewed for Season 56, according to a new report from the Daily Mail. Fans were in a state of pandemonium after it was announced the show <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/is-there-room-for-days-of-our-lives-on-streaming-services-fans-panic-fearing-dool-is-canceled-after-entire-cast-has-contracts-terminated-340247/">released the entire cast</a> from their contracts as filming ceased upon the end of Season 55. <i>Days of our Lives</i> first aired on November 8, 1965, and is the longest-running soap opera in television history. The show even has two veteran actors who have been with the program since its inception, met on set, fell in love and were married: Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes.</p>
      <p>The show has also been home to John Aniston (Jennifer Aniston’s father) who plays the leading villain Victor Kiriakis.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Mail’s reporting, <i>DOOL</i> executive producer Ken Corday informed the show’s production workers on Thursday that the show would be renewed.</p>
      <p>Fans were in the early stages of launching a social media campaign to save <i>Days of our Lives</i> if it were to be canceled.</p>
      <p>NBC has yet to release an official announcement and the Daily Mail quotes TMZ who spoke to an anonymous source who is close to the situation and says they are still working out the technicalities for the new deal.</p>

      <p>Chrishell Hartley, who plays Jordan Ridgeway, spoke to TMZ and expressed optimism that the show would be renewed.</p>
      <p>She stated the following to TMZ.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think the show, [producers are] trying really hard to save it, so it’s not as dire as it sounds. They really want to save the show, so if you watch the show definitely tune in and if you tuned out, tune back in.”</blockquote>
      <p>If show creators were looking at viewers and contemplating canceling the show, hopefully, enough fans will get the message and tune in.</p>
      <p>The news that <i>Days of our Live</i>s might be canceled went viral and fans began sharing their opinions on different social media platforms stating how much they wanted the show to be saved.</p>
      <p>Now that the word is that NBC will renew the series, will there be more viewers for Days of our Lives Season 56? What do you think? Are you happy the show will be renewed?</p>
