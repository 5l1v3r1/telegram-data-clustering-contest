      <p>Tickets for the royal affair at Arena Birmingham on Saturday 28 and Sunday 29 November 2020 are now on sale.</p>
      <p>The Tattoo, which will hold approximately 1,200 performers this weekend, is set for a grand return in 2020.</p>
      <p>Culminating marching bands and jaw dropping displays, the show will feature a Grand Finale that has repeatedly wowed spectators for years on end.</p>
      <p>The three hour extravaganza is led by the world-famous Band and Corps of Drums of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines, and we’ve welcomed marching bands from France, Poland and the Netherlands to join our home grown talent in the past.</p>

      <p>The event has become an annual tradition in Birmingham and a proud showcase of military activity.</p>
      <p>The spectacle of pomp and pageantry has previously included appearances from the Kilgore Rangerettes, Royal Air Force Cosford Queen’s Colour, the RNRMC Field Gun Competition, guest vocal soloists and the Parade of Massed Standards.</p>
      <p>The tattoo remains a must-see for the British public, with arena goers flocking to the show to marvel at the astonishing production values. Many people even admit to being brought to tears by the incredible showcase of British heroism.</p>
      <p>It seems only appropriate that Arena Birmingham, the city’s biggest venue, has been selected to helm the momentous event.</p>
