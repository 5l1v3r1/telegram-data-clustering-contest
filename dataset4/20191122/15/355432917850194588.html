      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.) said Thursday on "The Late Show" that a newly announced probe by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/lindsey-graham">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) into former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> is a "distraction" from the "criminal living in the White House."</p>
      <p>"It's the same thing that they've been doing which is to create a big distraction from the facts and the evidence, and frankly, my perspective is 'leave Joe alone,'" Harris, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said of <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471571-graham-requests-state-department-documents-on-bidens-ukraine">Graham's probe</a>, which relates to Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. </p>
      <p>"The Burisma, the Biden probe, it's a bunch of B.S. and it's to distract," she told "Late Show" host <a href="https://thehill.com/people/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>.</p>
      <p>"It also speaks to the fact that they know they have to create this big distraction because there's a lot there, otherwise that the American public is focusing on that tells us about the fact that we have a criminal living in the White House," the Democratic presidential hopeful said. </p>
      <p>Graham said in a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LG%20to%20MP%20re%20Biden%20and%20Ukraine.pdf">Thursday letter</a> to Secretary of State <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mike-pompeo">Mike Pompeo</a> that he wants documents connected to the Bidens and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>He specifically requested documents "to assist in answering questions regarding allegations that Vice President Biden played a role in the termination of Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin in an effort to end the investigation of the company employing his son." </p>
      <p>The probe comes amid the House's impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> over his own actions regarding Ukraine. Republicans have focused on Hunter Biden's seat on the board of Burisma during the investigation.  Harris and Joe Biden are among more than a dozen people running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and faced off on the debate stage on Wednesday night. </p>
