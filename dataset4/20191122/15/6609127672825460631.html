        <b>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has been placed in special measures after being accused of covering up the deaths of two young kids - among 25 who picked up an infection at the city's superhospital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a letter to the Health and Sport Committee, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the health board had been escalated to stage four of the NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework due to "ongoing issues relating to infection prevention, management and control at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children".</p>

      <p>She said further action was required to reclaim the public's confidence in their ability for infection prevention, management and control.</p>
      <p>Milly Main, 10, was in remission from cancer when she <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4978745/glasgow-health-board-superhospital-apologises-death-girl/">contracted a bug believed to be from contaminated water</a>, and later died.</p>
      <p>Milly's mum Kimberly Darroch said she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10357665/heartbroken-mum-who-claims-daughter-was-killed-by-dirty-water-at-hospital-begs-health-chiefs-to-tell-the-truth/">felt "let down and lied to"</a> and "100 per cent convinced" that her daughter was killed by contaminated water.</p>
      <p>And Jeane Freeman slammed the health board and admitted Milly's death may have been as a result of contaminated water.</p>
      <p>Freeman's blast came after she was forced to make an apology at Holyrood, where she also brought up concerns raised by other patients.</p>
      <p>She branded the health board's handling of the situation 'appalling' and blasted them for criticising the whistleblower who exposed the scandal.</p>
      <h3>LETTER IN FULL</h3>
      <p>I am writing to you following my statement to Parliament on Wednesday 20 November on the recent issues relating to infection prevention, management and control at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and Royal Hospital for Children (RHC).</p>
      <p>In light of the on-going issues around the systems, processes and governance in relation to infection prevention, management and control at the QEUH and the RHC and the associated communication and public engagement issues, I have concluded that further action is necessary to support the Board to ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence in these matters and therefore that for this specific issue the Board will be escalated to Stage 4 of our performance framework.  This stage is defined as ‘significant risks to delivery, quality, financial performance or safety; senior level external transformational support required.’</p>
      <p>The intention of the escalation would ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence and strengthen current approaches that are in place to mitigate avoidable harms.</p>
      <p>As a result, an Oversight Board will be put in place, chaired by Professor Fiona McQueen, Chief Nursing Officer.  Professor Craig White will continue to lead and direct the work required to improve the provision of responses, information and support to patients and their families and to now also to explicitly support improvements in the delivery of effective clinical governance and assurance within the Directorates identified through the work carried out to date. This will be augmented with specific support for Infection Prevention &amp; Control, communications and engagement.</p>
      <p>I will keep Parliament updated on the role of the Oversight Board and the actions that it is taking, as the work progresses.</p>
      <p>I have attached a copy of the letter to the Board and I have copied this letter to each of the party spokespeople on health and to Mr Sarwar given his particular interests and engagement on this matter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to leave 'no stone unturned' in helping the family get answers.</p>
      <p>Labour Health Spokesperson Monica Lennon said:"This is a long overdue intervention in a health board which has lost the confidence and trust of families long ago.</p>
      <p>"It shouldn't have taken parents and staff whistle-blowers speaking out to force the government into taking special measures.</p>
      <p>"When I asked Jeane Freeman in Parliament if she still has full confidence in the leadership of the health board, she ducked the question. The Scottish Government must now confirm whether they are happy for the Chief Executive and the current leadership team to continue in their roles.</p>
      <p>"The Chief Executive is managing a board which has badly let down many families, and this cannot be allowed to continue."</p>
