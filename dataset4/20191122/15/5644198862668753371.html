      <p>Auto sales at Ford Motor Co's China venture with Chongqing-based carmaker Changan are likely to turn positive next year, Changan’s president said on Friday.</p>
      <p>GUANGZHOU, China/Beijing: Auto sales at Ford Motor Co's China venture with Chongqing-based carmaker Changan are likely to turn positive next year, Changan’s president said on Friday.</p>
      <p>That points to a potential reversal in Ford's declining fortunes in the world's biggest auto market, as the U.S. auto maker has grappled with shrinking sales and problems such as an ageing model lineup.</p>

      <p>The slide in Ford's sales has been unprecedented for a major global automaker in China. After a peak of 1.08 million vehicles in 2016, sales began faltering in late 2017, then nearly halved last year to 504,488, according to consultancy IHS Markit.</p>
      <p>"There are good signs that Changan Ford's sales will get better," Changan president Zhu Huarong told Reuters on the sidelines of Guangzhou Autoshow.</p>
      <p>"Changan, Ford and JMC are jointly discussing about future product planning," he said, referring to Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) , in which Ford also has a stake.</p>
      <p>When asked when sales might start growing again, he said "next year", without providing more details.</p>
      <p>Changan Ford sold 147,276 vehicles in the first ten months this year, more than halving from 335,535 over the same period last year, according to its filing.</p>
