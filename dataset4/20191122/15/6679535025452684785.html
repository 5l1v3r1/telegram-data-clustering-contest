      <p>A 32-year-old homemaker died after falling off the terrace of her three-storied house in Sector-9 of MVP Colony on Friday.</p>
      <p>The deceased has been identified as Sridevi (32), a native of Srikakulam. According to MVP Colony police, Sridevi had gone to the terrace to check whether the water tank was filled.</p>
      <h3>Head injuries</h3>
      <p>“We suspect that Sridevi might have fallen off the terrace accidentally as the parapet wall is about two-and-a-half-feet high. She received grievous head injuries and died on the spot,” said MVP police station inspector Ch. Shanmukha Rao.</p>
      <p>Sridevi, her husband and two children have been living in the city since the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>Police said that family members and relatives said that Sridevi did not have any disputes with any of her family members. A case has been registered. Investigation is on.</p>
