      <p>By Kate Crawford of AI Now Institute and Vladan Joler, ‘Anatomy of an AI System’ is both a research project and a complex diagram (extract right) through which its results are published.</p>
      <p>“It investigates the three main parts required to build and operate a voice assistant – from the environmental effects of extracting rare earth metals and the wide disparity in workers’ income, to the data that these devices can gather without the users’ knowledge,” according to the Museum.</p>
      <p>Information highlighted by designers includes that a child miner would need to work ~700,000 years to earn the same amount as a top-paid CEO from the industry gets in a day ($275m, “<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AFR6231832016ENGLISH.PDF">as documented by Amnesty International”, according to the Museum</a>.)</p>
      <p>“AI is such a prevailing feature of the future of technology it seemed the perfect moment to analyse its impact, which this project does,” said judging chair Dr Paul Thompson, pf the Royal College of Art. “In the future, when you purchase a piece of digital hardware it could have the ingredients listed.  This project shows how this might look and makes everyone who sees it think about all the unseen impact of tech hardware. You will never look at your smart home hub the same way again.”</p>
      <p>The full <a href="https://anatomyof.ai/img/ai-anatomy-map.pdf">pictorial result chart can be found here</a>, and it is excellent.</p>
