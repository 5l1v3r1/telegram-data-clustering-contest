      <p>Pope Francis on Friday warned that technology and globalisation were homogenising young people around the world to the point where their uniqueness and cultural individuality were becoming endangered species.</p>
      <p>The 82-year-old pontiff made his appeal for young people to hold on to the cultures handed down by their ancestors and cherish their roots at a meeting of leaders of other religions as he wrapped up the last full day of his visit to Thailand.</p>
      <p>He decried a “growing tendency to discredit local values and cultures by imposing a unitary model” for values on young people, referring apparently to Western influence from films, advertising and social media.</p>
      <p>“This produces a cultural devastation that is just as serious as the disappearance of species of animals and plants,” he said.</p>
      <p>The preservation of local culture was also a theme of a visit on Friday to the predominantly Catholic village of Wat Roman on the outskirts of Bangkok.</p>

      <p>The dominant culture in Thailand is closely tied to Buddhism, although the Catholic minority of fewer than one per cent were generally treated well in modern times.</p>
      <p>In a talk to priests and nuns gathered in the village church, Francis paid tribute to those killed for their faith in the past.</p>
      <p>Among them were seven Catholics, including three teenage girls, who were killed by Thai police in 1940 in the Northeastern province of Nakhon Phanom.</p>
      <p>The World War II period and other spells of persecution are considered aberrations and today relations between Buddhists and Catholics are generally very good.</p>
      <p>During the reign of Thailand’s King Narai 350 years ago, the Vatican formally established its “Mission de Siam”.</p>
      <p>Although missionaries failed to achieve mass conversions, they were largely tolerated by the Buddhist majority and particularly the royal court.</p>
