      <p>To coincide with the release of Disney’s new Frozen 2 movie, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/panic-at-the-disco/">Panic! At The Disco</a> have unveiled a video for their cover of Into The Unknown.</p>
      <p>Brendon Urie’s rendition of the Disney banger is taken from the end credits of the movie, while in the actual film it’s performed by Idina Menzel (who plays Elsa).</p>

      <p>Naturally, then, it’s only right that Panic!’s new video is a wonderful mixture of Frozen 2 footage, and the frontman looking incredibly dapper as he belts out the song onstage in an empty theatre. In fact, the clip actually has some real Death Of A Bachelor vibes, only, well… icier.</p>
      <p>Check it out below.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the week, Brendon revealed a <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/listen-to-panic-at-the-discos-new-metal-song/">pretty bloody epic new</a> Panic! At The Disco metal song. And while it likely won’t find its way onto the follow-up to last year’s brilliant Pray For The Wicked album, it was nonetheless brilliant to hear the musician embracing his love of heavier music.</p>
      <p>On the subject of new Panic! music, Brendon revealed back in May that it “won’t be too long” until another album.</p>
      <p>“I thought I would take a little more time off and I’m already starting music,” he told Billboard. “Not with anything planned in mind, but just working on some ideas. I can’t help myself, so I don’t think it’ll be too long before another Panic! record.”</p>
