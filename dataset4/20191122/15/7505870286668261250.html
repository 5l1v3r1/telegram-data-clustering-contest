      <p>Philips Hue is obviously the biggest name in smart lighting, and Black Friday is a great time to expand your setup because there are always discounts on just about everything Philips Hue makes. That said, if you’re starting from scratch or you want so add smart lighting to a new room and you don’t care if it can connect to your Philips Hue setup, there are MUCH cheaper options out there. Case in point: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PMWX4RB?tag=b0c55-20">4-packs of Gosund WiFi Smart Light Bulbs</a> are on sale right now for only $30.99 if you use the coupon code 97X83ORD at checkout. That’s just $7.75 a piece for bulbs that are just as good as Philips Hue smart LED lights. Actually, these are even better because they don’t even need a hub to work with the app, Alexa, or Google Assistant!</p>
