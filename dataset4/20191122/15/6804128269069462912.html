      <p>For the first time ever Arsenal's Premier League matches will be shown exclusively on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1558242&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FPremierLeague%3F%26tag%3Dreachregional-21&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.football.london%2Farsenal-fc%2Fnews%2Farsenal-fans-can-watch-december-17301612">Amazon Prime.</a></p>
      <p>Arsenal will face Brighton at the Emirates Stadium on 5 December and later in the month will travel to Bournemouth on Boxing Day in two Premier League fixtures in December.</p>
      <p>The two games are notable for being shown on Amazon for the first time - and Arsenal fans can watch the match completely free.</p>
      <p>Amazon has launched the Arsenal pages for the live games and says fans can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1558242&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FPremierLeague%3F%26tag%3Dreachregional-21&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.football.london%2Farsenal-fc%2Fnews%2Farsenal-fans-can-watch-december-17301612">sign up for a free Amazon Prime Video trial</a> now to secure a month's worth of access completely free.</p>
      <p>As long as the Prime Video subscription is cancelled before the month is up users will not have to pay a penny. Fans can switch between all Premier League games as they happen via Amazon Prime Video.</p>
      <p>To get both games fans should wait until after 26 November to secure the package and get free Premier League matches for a month. The pass will also give access to a host of other fixtures including the Merseyside Derby and Manchester United versus Spurs.</p>
      <p>However, the Amazon free trial is not the only way for Arsenal fans to view both December matches.</p>
      <p>BT has announced new and existing customers who have BT Sport packages and renew their contract will get six months worth of Amazon Prime Video free in time for the December fixtures.</p>
