      <p>While delivering his speech, Ruto stated that he would not keep off Kibra politics.</p>
      <p>"We have learnt key lessons from the Kibra mini poll. Through Mariga, the Jubilee administration will build a church, schools and a mosque," he promised.</p>
      <p>According to the results announced by the IEBC on Friday, November 8, ODM parliamentary candidate Imran Okoth garnered 24,636 votes beating Mariga who managed 11,230 votes, a difference of 13,406 votes.</p>
      <p>Mariga had on Thursday, November 7, evening conceded an early defeat when he called to congratulate his opponent.</p>
      <p>"Hello boss, this is Mariga, I have called to congratulate you. The race has been fair and I am ready to support you in whatever you need," admitted Mariga in the phone call.</p>
      <p>Imran accepted the early victory as he agreed to work with Mariga and uphold their friendship.</p>
