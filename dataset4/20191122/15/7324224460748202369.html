      <p>Frank Lampard has insisted he will never follow Jose Mourinho’s lead and manage Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Chelsea boss Lampard believes Tottenham are still a top-four threat for the Premier League this term, despite Spurs languishing down in 14th place after 12 matches.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked this week and two-time Chelsea boss Mourinho jumped straight into the hot seat at the Blues’ bitter rivals.</p>
      <p>When asked if he could ever envisage managing Spurs, Lampard replied: “I can firmly say no, and you can replay that again in 10 years.</p>
      <p>“It wouldn’t happen but I think things are different for me.</p>
      <p>“I was here for 13 years as a player and have an absolutely deep feeling for a club.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea is certainly so close to my heart hence why I am so proud to manage the club and why I wouldn’t manage Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“That’s no disrespect to anyone, it’s just because of what Chelsea has given me over my time as a player and now, it’s certainly not on my list.”</p>

      <p>Asked if he was surprised Mourinho took the helm at Tottenham, Lampard said: “That’s only his decision, and you make that decision as you go.</p>
      <p>“He’s managed a lot of football clubs and that’s what happens.</p>
      <p>“If fans judge you that’s out of your hands. As a professional you have to understand the right to work.”</p>
      <p>Lampard revealed he has sent Mourinho a good-luck message ahead of the Portuguese boss taking charge of Tottenham for the first time.</p>
      <p>“We had a couple of messages just to wish him well in his new role as he has always done for me.</p>
      <p>“Spurs are a very good team. At the start of the season Spurs were a lot of people’s favourites to be in the race.</p>

      <p>“But if you look at what Pochettino has built, I have huge respect for what he’s built.</p>
      <p>“They are in a slightly false position I believe.</p>
      <p>“They have all the structure, stadium and all those things. They will be a threat without a doubt, Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“Without a doubt they are in the top four race, that’s the start at the start of the season and it will be the story now.</p>
      <p>“That’s why they reached the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>“If you look at the strength in depth, they are going to be a threat. I knew that before and I know that now.”</p>

      <p>Christian Pulisic is in contention for Saturday’s Premier League trip to Manchester City, with the United States forward back in full training after a groin concern.</p>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi could miss out however due to a minor hamstring issue picked up on England duty.</p>
      <p>Champions City are already nine points shy of Premier League leaders Liverpool after a patchy start to the new campaign, but Lampard insists Guardiola’s men have not lost their edge.</p>
      <p>“I still see them as the same strength,” said Lampard.</p>
      <p>“I’ve watched them a lot this international break. They’ve had their injury problems but they are a great team and still as big a threat as they always have been.</p>

      <p>“It’s a great test tomorrow, head to head, to see where we’re at.</p>
      <p>“But anyone can go to Manchester City, play at their best and still and lose.</p>
      <p>“So I won’t be making huge judgements win or lose tomorrow without a doubt.</p>
      <p>“Our story is three months in the making. Their story has been four years and more of hard work from top to bottom.”</p>
