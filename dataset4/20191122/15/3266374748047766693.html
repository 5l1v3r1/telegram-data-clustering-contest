      <h1>2019/20 Premier League Matchday 13: Best Tips for ‘Big Six’ Fixtures and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:17:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/abhishek_b/" target="_blank">Abhisek Bajaj</a></address>
      <p>Club football returns after a definitive international break that saw most of the nations lock down their places for Euro 2020. Premier League throws up some intriguing matchups, with Jose Mourinho’s return to management headlining the gameweek. Tottenham are up against West Ham in an early kickoff as Mourinho goes up against a known enemy in Manuel Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>Highlights among the following batch of fixtures are Liverpool’s away trip to face Crystal Palace, a struggling Everton at home to Norwich and Leicester looking to make it five league wins out of five as they face Brighton. Arsenal are also among the teams in the batch of fixtures that follow Tottenham vs West Ham. But, the Gunners face a Southampton side that have not seen a win for weeks now.</p>
      <p>Saturday ends with Manchester City at home to Chelsea in a fixture that could really define the Premier League title race. Sunday sees Sheffield United host Manchester United, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer now reportedly having to look over his shoulder now that Mauricio Pochettino is available. The gameweek ends with a Monday night fixture between Aston Villa and Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Before we move on to the ninth matchday and the tips for the matches, let us look at how our tips for the last Matchday fared.</p>

      <h3>West Ham vs Tottenham</h3>

      <p>Enter, Jose! Mauricio Pochettino’s exit from Tottenham has been bittersweet; for it has paved the way for the return of Jose Mourinho in management. The first test arrives quickly for Mourinho away at West Ham. But, Spurs are facing West Ham at the right time of the season, with the Hammers struggling for form in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>We pick Tottenham, with Jose Mourinho to kick his Spurs managerial stint off with a win in a London derby.</p>
      <h4>Probables:</h4>
      <p>1. Tottenham to win @ 1.70</p>
      <p>2. Harry Kane to score anytime @ 1.61</p>
      <h4>Outside Chance:</h4>
      <p>1. Tottenham to win to NIL @ 3.50</p>
      <h3>Arsenal vs Southampton</h3>
      <p>A match that Arsenal should not have a problem in winning, given the relative position of the two teams on the table. But, the stark reality is different. Arsenal are also without a win for 4 league matches now and face a Southampton side that will be looking to exploit their defensive weaknesses.</p>
      <p>Expect goals in this encounter, with Arsenal likely to eke out a win.</p>
      <h4>Probables:</h4>
      <p>1. Both Teams to Score – YES @ 1.61</p>
      <h4>Outside Chance:</h4>
      <p>1. Full Time Result – Draw @ 4.75</p>
      <h3>Crystal Palace vs Liverpool</h3>
      <p>There are good news on the injury front for Liverpool going into their match against Crystal Palace. But, Palace again are on a winless run of 4 league games and are up against a Liverpool side that are still undefeated in the 2019-20 Premier League. It is a fixture whose result should be set in stone. But, Palace are known to cause Liverpool problems, judging by history. Expect goals.</p>
      <h4>Probables:</h4>
      <p>1. Over 2.5 Match Goals @ 1.66</p>
      <h4>Outside Chance:</h4>
      <p>1. Full Time Result – Draw @ 4.75</p>
      <h3>Manchester City vs Chelsea</h3>

      <p>Interestingly, Chelsea come into the game with better form than Manchester City and Frank Lampard will be looking to inflict more damage while also looking to lodge a victory against a ‘Big Six’ side to prove their own credentials for top four and perhaps, the title as well. Again, a fixture that should be filled with goalmouth action.</p>
      <h4>Probables:</h4>
      <p>1. Both Teams to Score – YES @ 1.57</p>
      <h4>Outside Chance:</h4>
      <p>1. Raheem Sterling to score 2 or more @ 5.00</p>
      <h3>Sheffield United vs Manchester United</h3>
      <p>Sheffield United fans will be pleasantly shocked to find themselves not just at fifth on the table fairly deep into the campaign but also above their Sunday opponents Manchester United. While the match means Dean Henderson cannot play against his mother club, the Blades would be quietly confident of registering a result on Sunday at home.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hit with injury problems in midfield and we could see a fairly youthful midfield for Manchester United. It will be interesting to see how the two Uniteds cope up with each other.</p>
      <h4>Probables:</h4>
      <p>1. Manchester United to win @ 2.10</p>
      <h4>Outside Chance:</h4>
      <p>1. Manchester United to win to NIL @ 3.50</p>
      <h3>Miscellaneous Tips</h3>

        <figcaption>Need to improve their away form, starting with the match against Watford. (Picture Courtesy – AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Bournemouth’s record of both teams scoring in their Premier League matches so far is a trend that we would like to go with rather than against as they face Wolves. Leicester have a tricky away tie at Brighton and it will be interesting to if the home side can prove to be any trouble for the Foxes.</p>
      <p>Everton need a win against Norwich to try and extend their momentum gained from the last two matches. Watford are yet to win at home and Burnley have failed to record an away win so far this season, making the fixture an intriguing one for the neutrals. Newcastle are unbeaten in three games and will be the favoured side when they travel to Aston Villa.</p>
      <h4>Probables:</h4>
      <p>1. Bournemouth vs Wolves – Both Teams to Score – YES @ 1.75</p>
      <p>2. Brighton vs Leicester – Both Teams to Score – YES @ 1.75</p>
      <p>3. Aston Villa vs Newcastle – Full Time Result – Draw or Newcastle @ 1.72</p>
      <h4>Outside Chance:</h4>
      <p>1. Newcastle to beat Aston Villa @ 3.70</p>
