      <p>“The thing about young people is, if you give them an opportunity, not only do they seize it, they never let you down," Ferguson told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/633202/sir-alex-ferguson-jose-mourinho-tottenham-academy/">talkSPORT.</a></p>

      <p>“And they all did very well, and they’re also very good human beings.</p>
      <p>“They’re [Rashford, McTominay and Greenwood] all doing well.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good set up at United. For any young kid going there, it’s a great club to go to.</p>
      <p>“And I think England are producing great young players who are representing their country and that can only be a good thing.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully Scotland can follow that!”</p>
      <p>Ferguson has advised Jose Mourinho he has nothing to lose by playing Tottenham's youngsters - after gaining a reputation for not utilising United's youth while he was in charge.</p>
