      <p>DigDat has teamed up with one of the hottest duos in the U.K. right now, D Block Europe, for the new single, "New Dior." DigDat has been making waves this year following his single, "Airforce" entering the UK Singles charts. Their new single, "New Dior" is a dark banger, treading closer to the regional UK drill sound that's been making noise in the past year. Young Adz holds down a syrupy hook before DigDat and DirtBike LB swing in on the verses.</p>
      <p>D Block Europe have claimed serious dominance in the U.K. this year. With collaborations with Dave, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby/profile/">Lil Baby</a>, AJ Tracey, and more on their recently released <i>PTSD</i>, they've shown that they can hold their own among international giants.</p>
      <p>Peep the song below.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>Bank rolls, bank-bank rolls, hella VVS' on me<br/>Cali weed, promethazine, and I keep a weapon on me<br/>Took her Dior, bought the store, she on me<br/>Flew her abroad, hit it raw, she on me</p>
