      <h1>PSA: Destiny 2 is down on all platforms, not just Google Stadia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:56:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/skylled/" target="_blank">Kyle Bradshaw</a></address>
      <p>Today is the first Friday following the launch of Google Stadia, and no doubt there are people who are diving into Stadia Pro’s best (in this author’s biased opinion) free game, <i>Destiny 2</i>. However, <i>Destiny 2</i> is not currently playable on Google Stadia, or any other platform for that matter, as server issues are currently plaguing the game with error code “stork.”</p>
      <p>For the past few hours, any and all Google Stadia players who attempted to log in to <i>Destiny 2</i> have been greeted with one of two nasty looking error messages. In fact, all players who were actively playing when the errors began were kicked out of their Destiny 2 sessions.</p>
      <blockquote>Could not sign in to Destiny 2 servers. Please try again later.<br/>For more information, visit <a href="https://help.bungie.net/">help.bungie.net</a> and search for error code: stork</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Server offline<br/>Destiny 2 is currently unavailable. Watch <a href="https://help.bungie.net/">help.bungie.net</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp">@BungieHelp</a> for updates as we work to restore service.</blockquote>
      <p>While it may seem easy to point to this as yet another failing of the Google Stadia launch, the error is far more widespread, affecting <i>Destiny 2</i> on all platforms and even the original <i>Destiny</i> on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Bungie is aware of the situation and is investigating Destiny 2’s stork errors now.</p>

      <p><b>Update 5:10pm</b>: Bungie has now identified the cause of Destiny’s server issues, and are applying the necessary fixes. By the current estimates, Stadia players should be able to play <i>Destiny 2</i> starting at 7PM Pacific or 10PM Eastern tonight.</p>

      <p>Needless to say, this is a disappointing turn of events for those who were looking forward to squeezing in some time of their first weekend with Google Stadia on <i>Destiny 2</i>. At the very least, we all still have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/17/google-stadia-adds-10-more-games-to-launch-lineup-hints-at-second-pro-title/">Samurai Shodown</a> to play, right?</p>
