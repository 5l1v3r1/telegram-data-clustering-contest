      <p>The Deparment of Water and Sanitation has encouraged water-users in drought-stricken areas of the Eastern Cape to boil their drinking water before consumption.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Friday, it said that it had received numerous complaints of poor water quality in several parts of the province.</p>
      <p>"The Department of Water and Sanitation would like to encourage water users, especially in the areas of Nelson Mandela Bay, Adelaide, Bedford as well as Butterworth, to take particular care when drinking water from their taps," said spokesperson Sputnik Ratau.</p>
      <p>He said residents in parts of Nelson Mandela Bay reported that water coming out of the taps had become dark and they found it difficult to drink.</p>
      <p>Ratau also said that communities in Butterworth depend on water tankers provided by the Amathole District Municipality, adding that it was also wise for the community to continue boiling their water.</p>
      <p>He said in towns such as Bedford and Adelaide there was no water to flush toilets and the towns were receiving water three days a week. Â </p>
      <p>"DWS has advised residents to boil water in places where water interruptions have occurred," Ratau said.</p>
