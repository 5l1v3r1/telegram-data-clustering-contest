      <p>Bangladesh, who were skittled out inside 31 overs, had to call two concussion substitutes after Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan sustained nasty blows to helmet.</p>
      <p>Earlier, India's pace trio took less than three hours to rout the tourists after Mominul Haque's decision to bat backfired.</p>
      <p>After the lull of the first six overs, Ishant drew first blood, trapping Imrul Kayes lbw en route to an impressive figures of 5-22.</p>

      <p>New-ball partner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> (3-29) immediately benefited from a change of ends, dismissing Mominul and Mohammad Mithun in the same over to trigger a spectacular batting collapse.</p>
      <p>India captain Virat Kohli had predicted close-in fielders would struggle to catch the harder, faster pink balls but his fears proved unfounded.</p>
      <p>Rohit Sharma took a diving one-handed catch to sent back Mominul, Wriddhiman Saha flew to his right to cut short Mahmudullah's stay and Cheteshwar Pujara dived forward to pouch a low catch to remove Mehidy Hasan Miraz.</p>
      <p>Opener Shadman Islam topscored for Bangladesh with 29, while Liton retired hurt on 24 after being hit on the helmet by a Mohammed Shami delivery.</p>
      <p>Mehidy came on as concussion substitute and Mithun replaced Liton behind the stumps when India came out to bat.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh needed a second concussion substitute in Taijul Islam after Nayeem also sustained a hit on the helmet by another vicious Shami delivery.</p>
      <p>Both Mehidy and Taijul were dropped in the two changes to their playing XI earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Indian openers looked at ease against the pink ball but neither Mayank Agarwal (14) nor Rohit Sharma (21) could convert their starts.</p>
      <p>Pujara and Kohli helped India eclipse Bangladesh's paltry total with their 95-run stand.</p>
      <p>Pujara made 55 before edging Ebadot Hossain, who unfurled his second salute celebration, but Kohli went on to complete 5,000 runs as Test captain.</p>
