      <p>A dog left alone in its owner’s car managed to drive the vehicle around in circles for an entire hour.</p>
      <p>Residents of a street in Port St Lucie, Florida, were concerned after they saw the vehicle reversing around and around outside their homes.</p>
      <p>And they were stunned when they went outside and realized what was behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>Eyewitness Anne Sabol said: ‘First I thought I saw somebody backing up but then they kept going and I’m like OK what are they doing.</p>

      <p>‘And when the cops got the door open a black dog jumped out I was like they should give that thing a license.’</p>
      <p>The doggy driver struck a mailbox, garbage cans and bricks left laying out in front of several houses, <a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/neighbors-find-dog-behind-the-wheel-of-moving-car/29875948">WPBF</a> reported.</p>
      <p>But both animal and car left largely unscathed, with locals still mystified as to how the dog managed to get behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>Port St Lucie Police believe the dog may have been able to joyride after the car’s owner stepped out of the vehicle and accidentally left it in reverse.</p>
