      <h1>Chelsea fans can watch Villa and Bournemouth fixtures free in December</h1>
      <h2>The fixtures will both be shown on Amazon Prime Video and anybody can get free access to watch them</h2>

      <p>Chelsea host Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on 4 December in a Premier League clash with a difference.</p>
      <p>The Villa match and the Boxing Day fixture at home to Southampton are unusual fixtures for Chelsea fans because those who are not attending will be able to watch the Blues play on Amazon for the first time.</p>
      <p>The online retailer has bought the rights to show 30 Premier League games in December and that means two Chelsea fixtures will not be shown on Sky Sports or BT Sport.</p>
      <p>Instead Amazon will be showing them on <a href="https://amzn.to/2rkhqPq">Amazon Prime Video,</a> a subscription service that will allow fans to switch between all Premier League games on two December match days including Boxing Day.</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans can sign up to watch all of the matches free by taking out an <a href="https://amzn.to/2rkhqPq">Amazon Prime Video free trial.</a> The trial period lasts a month, which means fans get enough time to watch every fixture before they can cancel the trail without paying a penny.</p>
      <p>To get both games fans should wait until after 26 November to secure the package and get free Premier League matches for a month. The pass will also give access to a host of other fixtures including the Merseyside Derby and Manchester United versus Spurs.</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans who have BT have another way to watch the fixtures.</p>
      <p>BT has announced new and existing customers who have BT Sport packages and renew their contract will get six months worth of Amazon Prime Video free in time for the December fixtures.</p>
      <p>The full list of Prime games are:</p>
      <p>3-5 December</p>
      <p>Arsenal vs Brighton</p>
      <p>Burnley vs Manchester City</p>
