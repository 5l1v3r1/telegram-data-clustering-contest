      <p>Eight people have denied murdering a 17-year-old in Barry and are due to stand trial next year.</p>
      <p>Nathan Delafontaine, Raymond Thompson, Leon Clifford, Lewis Evans, Leon Symons, Ryan Palmer, Peter McCarthy, and a 16-year-old boy all entered not guilty pleas.</p>
      <p>They are accused of murdering Harry Baker, from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/rumney">Rumney</a> in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> , who was described by his family as a “fun-loving son and brother”. His body was found at 5.50am on August 28 at Barry Intermodal Termnial in Wimborne Road.</p>
      <p>The courtroom at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-crown-court">Cardiff Crown Court</a> was full for the hearing with around 30 people in the public gallery and another 15 members of the public sitting in the jury bench. Two police officers stood at the back of the courtroom.</p>
      <p>The case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing before Judge Neil Bidder QC.</p>
      <p>Delafontaine, 32, Clifford, 22, and Symons, 21, who do not have fixed addresses, denied murder.</p>
      <p>Thompson, 47, from Hillary Rise in Barry; Evans, 60, from Merganser Court in Barry; Palmer, 33, from Aberaeron Close; and McCarthy, 36, from Bassett Street in Barry, also entered not guilty pleas.</p>
      <p>Clifford appeared via video link from HM Exeter Prison while the other defendants were in the dock with several dock officers. There were 15 barristers in court for the hearing.</p>
      <p>Paul Lewis QC, prosecuting, said: “It goes without saying there will have to be a trial for all.”</p>
      <p>The trial is due to start on February 24 next year at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/newport-crown-court">Newport Crown Court</a> and is expected to last for six weeks before Mr Justice Simon Picken.</p>
      <p>As the hearing came to an end a woman held up a photograph and shouted. Four police officers went over and the public gallery was cleared.</p>
