      <p>We must admit to being pretty big fans here of <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/thermaltake">Thermaltake</a> products and particularly their <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/power-supply">power supplies</a>. Admittedly, a power supply is rarely the ‘fanciest’ thing in your system, with Thermaltake being one of the few brands looking to change that, however, they’re definitely forcing their way into being one of the biggest and best-known manufacturers out there.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Connections</h3>
      <p>As this is a fully modular power supply, you have the option to only utilize the cables you need. A factor which is important if cable management is a top priority in your systems build.</p>
      <p>With a more than decent selection of cables on offer, Thermaltake has the vast majority of PC gaming systems covered here!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Packaging</h3>
      <p>The main packaging carries the black and silver design that has become well associated with Thermaltake Toughpower products. The front covers all of the main product highlights and features. In particular it gives you a nice clear view of the power supply with that ARGB lighting in action.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-8-compressed-1-880x472.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The rear carries all of the technical specifications and information. Details that are clear, informative and tell you everything you could want to know at a glance.</p>
      <p>If one thing is to be said about Thermaltake, they’re one of the few power supply manufacturers who really nail down the presentation of their products’ packaging!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/18-880x389.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Accessories</h3>
      <p>As this is a power supply, you clearly don’t want (or expect) masses of accessories. What Thermaltake does provide you with, however, covers all of the essentials and beyond.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4-12.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A particularly nice highlight is that the power supply is covered in a loose canvas ‘sleeve’ to prevent any scratches in transit. In addition, the power supply cable bag is of a nice strong quality.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/17-880x418.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>A Closer Look</h3>
      <p>Out of the box, the power supply continues the predominantly black and silver styling associated with the ‘Toughpower’ branding. Despite the lack of any notable bells and whistles (at least, until the light show begins) it looks at a glance like a very solid and well built PSU.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/15-880x484.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In terms of styling, there are always limits as to what you can achieve with power supplies. In this instance, however, and in keeping with the Toughpower image, the power supply looks professional and incredibly sturdy!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/13-880x531.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There is, of course, some branding to the front of the fan and to the sides of the power supply. This is all very in-keeping with the overall ethos of the aesthetics. The branding doesn’t add much, but it certainly doesn’t detract either.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/14-880x419.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The main modular power bank is very well organized. As you can see below, this PSU carries the ‘back to back’ design which makes insertion (and particularly removal) a <i>lot</i> easier. You will, in addition, note the RGB lighting power adaptor to the bottom right corner.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12-880x403.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The rear of the power supply has (perhaps surprisingly) quite a bit going on. It includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main power input</li>
        <li>The mains on/off switch</li>
        <li>The ‘Smart Zero’ fan control switch</li>
        <li>Manual RGB lighting controls for both color and mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-880x377.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Cabling</h3>
      <p>With it’s sleek and slim black design, the cabling for the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB looks both tidy and durable. If there is a criticism to be made of it, however, it is the fact that they’re not particularly long (roughly 60cm). As such, if you are the owner of an unusually large case or wish to utilize some high-levels of cable management, this may become an issue. It’s, at least, something you may have to consider.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-9-compressed-1-880x546.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Internals – A Look Inside!</h3>
      <p>After opening up the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB, the initial impressions are very good. It has a very clean and tidy presentation with no untidy cables to cause clutter or concern.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-6-compressed-1-880x452.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A closer look at the fan reveals it to be a Thermaltake TT-1425. This is a fan design we are very familiar with and is regularly used in Thermaltake’s more premium RGB products.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-compressed-3-880x578.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite all the RGB bells and whistles, Thermaltake has still managed to keep the PCB and components of the power supply very well organized. The main heat sinks have a nice just slightly off-central location which should help assist cooling. In addition, and, wherever possible, they should also keep that fan running at a bare minimum.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-compressed-4-880x586.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As it is one of the main noted features, it’s important for us to confirm that this does have Japanese capacitors. As you can see below, the two main capacitors are manufactured by ‘Nippon Chemi-Com’. A company which, as the name might have given you a hint, is indeed Japanese.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-compressed-3-880x576.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Overall Thoughts!</h3>
      <p>So far, the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB is certainly ticking all the right boxes in regards to what we want and like to see from a power supply. Not that, incidentally, we expected anything different from this manufacturer.</p>
      <p>So, I guess it’s time to see how this actually performs in a more practical application. Onto to the tests!</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Methodology &amp; Testing</h3>
      <p>At eTeknix we take the power supply testing procedure very seriously and have invested a lot of resources into acquiring the appropriate testing equipment. For all power supply reviews, we test the power supplies with dedicated power supply testing equipment. This means we are able to get the most accurate results from our testing as opposed to using software benchmarks (such as OCCT) or multi-meter readouts which are broadly inaccurate.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Testing Hardware</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sunmoon SM-5500ATE Active Load Tester (1200W rated)</li>
        <li>Stingray DS1M12 USB Oscilloscope</li>
        <li>Voltcraft DT-10L laser tachometer</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What the eTeknix Test Procedure Involves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Testing each power supply at 20/40/60/80/100% load (with load balanced across all rails) and measuring PFC (power factor correction), efficiency (actual power divided by power “pulled at the wall”) and voltage regulation (deviance from expected voltages of 3.3/5/12 on the main rails).</li>
        <li>Measuring ripple with an oscilloscope at 20/40/60/80/100% load.</li>
        <li>Measuring fan speed after a stabilisation period of five minutes at each load scenario using the Voltcraft DT-10L laser tachometer and a reflective strip on the fan.</li>
        <li>Testing each power supply’s OPP (Over Power Protection) mechanism and seeing how many watts each power supply can deliver before shutting down</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Other Things to Consider</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We recognise that a single 12-volt cable can provide only 6 Amps before overheating (which corrupts voltage regulation and efficiency) and so we used an adequate number of cables for each power supply to ensure there is not efficiency loss from poor cables selection</li>
        <li>Our Sunmoon SM-5500ATE power supply tester is not capable of testing more than 300W on each of the 12-volt rails so where a power supply provides more than 300W on a 12-volt rail that power is distributed over multiple 12-volt rails on the load tester. For example a power supply with one 12 volt rail supplying 750 watts would be spread equally over three 12 volt rails on the load tester, a power supply with two 450W 12v rails would be spread over four 12v rails on the load tester, two 225W 12v rails for each of the 12v rails on the unit.</li>
        <li>We use the same time scale and horizontal millivolt scale on our oscilloscope for all ripple tests, that is a 20ms T/DIV (horizontal) and a 0.02 V/DIV (vertical) meaning the scale is from -80mV to +80mV, ATX spec dictates that the 12v rail must fall within 150mv of ripple and the 3.3/5 within 50mv so that scale allows us to include both 150 and 50mV peaks. (Some older PSU reviews use different scales which were later ditched as the visual representation they give is inadequate, in these reviews written measurements are provided only).</li>
        <li>Deviance is the terminology used to represent the way voltages diverge from the expected values</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Voltage Regulation</h3>
      <p>To test voltage regulation we load the power supply to five different load scenarios that give an equal spread of load across every single rail. So that means 20% on all rails, 40% on all rails and so on. We then calculate the average deviance of each rail from its expected voltage. Ideally, anything of +/- 2% regulation is seen as a very good result.</p>
      <h3>Power Efficiency</h3>
      <p>Power efficiency is measured by calculating actual supplied wattage divided by the wattage drawn at the wall/plug, multiplied by 100 to give a percentage. We then compare that to the particular 80 Plus certification the company claims to see if it meets that. You can see the 80 Plus certifications below, we always test power supplies at 230v.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/80_plus_specs.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Power Factor Correction</h3>
      <p>Power Factor Correction is the ratio of the real power flowing to the load, to the apparent power in the circuit. The aim of PFC is to make the load circuitry that is power factor corrected appear purely resistive (apparent power equal to real power). In this case, the voltage and current are in phase and the reactive power consumption is zero. The closer the number to one the better as this allows the most efficient delivery of electrical power (Source – Wikipedia).</p>
      <h3>Ripple</h3>
      <p>Noise and Ripple can easily be measured by an oscilloscope. These show how much voltage fluctuation there is on a particular rail. We tested the rail stability of the 3.3-volt, 5-volt and 12-volt rails using an identical time and millivolt scale for all graphs. millivolt ripple is measured by the peak to peak size of the voltage curve.</p>
      <p>The latest ATX 12 volt version 2.3 specifications state that ripple from peak to peak must be no higher than 50 millivolts for the 3.3-volt and 5-volt rails, while the 12-volt rail is allowed up to 120 millivolts peak to peak to stay within specifications. Millivolt figures are stated to the closest increment of 5 given their variability.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sample_scalev2.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>OPP</h3>
      <p>Power supplies often quote as having various protection mechanisms such and the most important of these is Over Power Protection. In our testing we crank up the power draw until the power supply either shuts down (meaning the OPP mechanism is present and working) or blows up (meaning it is either not present or not working). We then note the maximum power consumption before the power supply shut down, or before it blew up.</p>
      <h3>Fan Speed</h3>
      <p>When testing in a power supply laboratory it is difficult to take fan noise readings. The noise from the Sunmoon test equipment and air conditioning corrupts everything. The next best thing in our circumstances was reading off the fan speed with a tachometer. Specifically to get an idea of the noise. The ambient temperature during testing held constant at 22 degrees, with 1 degree of variation. Each power supply had a consistent time period of 5 minutes to stabilise between each load scenario.</p>
      <p>In my experience, the following general relationships apply between noise levels and fan speeds. Though it can vary greatly between the type of fan used.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Below 800 RPM – Inaudible/Silent</li>
        <li>800 to 1000 RPM – Barely audible</li>
        <li>1000 – 1200 RPM – Audible but still quiet</li>
        <li>1200 – 1400 RPM – Moderately noisy</li>
        <li>1400 – 1800 RPM – Noisy</li>
        <li>1800 RPM or above – Intolerable</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Testing – A Practical Review</h3>
      <p>There are certain and isolated instances where power supplies simply do not like our testing machine. In our experience, this occurs in usually 5-10% of cases and we have never entirely determined exactly why this happens.</p>
      <p>As you can see from prior <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/thermaltake">power supply reviews we have conducted on Thermaltake products</a>, the issue isn’t with the manufacturer or their products. As the saying goes, it’s just one of those things!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-compressed-5-880x582.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Testing in Real-World Settings</h3>
      <p>When this occurs, the only option that really presents itself to us is seeing how the power supply works in a practical setting. Since we have the disposal of a test-bench (used in our cooling product reviews) we therefore decided to hook it up to the system and put it through its paces.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-0-compressed-10-880x606.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>So, how did it do? Well, the short answer is that despite it not liking our testing machine, it seemingly loved our test bench. Letting it run for nearly 2 hours on various performance benchmarks (so as to optimize the power draw on it) it never skipped a beat and provided some amazing RGB lighting effects!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-55.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>ARGB Lighting</h3>
      <p>The lighting effects to the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB are truly excellent. Even if you don’t have an ARGB compatible motherboard, the manual controls offered to the rear of the power supply ensure you can get this running exactly how you want it!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-compressed-10-880x597.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The colors are nice, bright, vivid. Everything you want from RGB lighting. As you can see in the video below too, they offer an amazing range of effects!</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ifOPezkQqfk" width="880" height="495" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Overpower Protection and Maximum wattage</h3>
      <p>Despite the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB not getting along particularly well in our more usual testing methodology, for reasons that muddy the waters even further, it was more than happy to work with the overpower protection test. No, we have no idea why this one particular test worked!</p>
      <p>So, how did it do? Well, the short answer is really well. Achieving 1097 before the protections kicked this is clearly a substantial number over the rated 850w. As such, if you do ever need <i>some</i> wiggle room, this power supply can happily oblige you.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-56-880x74.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>With a price in the region of <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/products/850w-thermaltake-toughpower-gf1-argb-full-modular-80-plus-gold-sli-crossfire-single-rail-709a-140mm?gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8KmluaQcVv57WU4R2RBk-o00hNOJ8eTRjH_SoreOhpl-B9wbWDq73efvEaAuk-EALw_wcB">£150,</a> the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB 850w power supply certainly isn’t cheap. Even by the usual standards set by the wattage amount or gold-efficiency rating level. With it being about 20-30% more expensive than their non-ARGB counterparts, I suppose the question is, is that worth the additional money?</p>
      <p>Well, only you can answer that in terms of your personal preference for aesthetics. What is clear is that this power supply is definitely, at least in those regards, a cut above the rest.</p>
      <p>For us, however, the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB is an amazingly well-designed power supply that genuinely looks good. You can’t say that often about PSUs now, can you?</p>
      <h3>How Did It Perform?</h3>
      <p>Although we were restricted to more ‘real-world’ practical aspects of testing, we had absolutely no complaints to make about this power supply. It ran perfectly acceptably during some very grunty benchmark tests and, overall, did everything you would want from a power supply. All, might we add, while looking very pretty with the ARGB lighting effects.</p>
      <h3>Is it Practical?</h3>
      <p>With it having a fully-modular cable design, this already ticks a major box for many consumers. Specifically, those who care about cable management in their systems. Is it practical, though? – Well, yes, with a little but. You see, while the power supply is more than pleasant to work with, there is a slight criticism we can make. Namely, that the cable lengths are not particularly good. Although I didn’t specifically measure each one, they probably average around 60cm in length. A length which (while not necessarily short) could provide some limitations to where and how you route these in your PC case.</p>
      <p>This power supply is, incidentally, available in 650/750/850 watt variants as well as the non-ARGB ‘standard’ GF1 range.</p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>The Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB 850w power supply is a premium product in more than just name. It really does carry all of the features the savvy power supply consumer would want to see.</p>
      <p>Yes, there has been a ‘mark-up’ in the price based on those excellent ARGB features and, as a consumer, you will have to decide if that’s worth it. It shouldn’t, incidentally, be overlooked that this comes with both gold-rated efficiency performance <i>and</i> a <i>huge</i> 10-year warranty.</p>
      <p>To us, the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 ARGB power supply both looks and performs fantastically and given the importance a power supply can have on a system, there isn’t a ‘want’ box that this one doesn’t tick!</p>
