      <h1>FemFest 2019 seeks to promote feminism in Indonesia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:11:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>FemFest 2019, a biennial feminist festival organized by the Jakarta Feminist Discussion Group, will be held this weekend at Wisma PKBI, Jakarta.</p>
      <p>The festival seeks to localize feminism, which many consider a western principle and not in line with Indonesian culture.</p>
      <p> “This year’s FemFest wants to increase the understanding that feminism is not imported, but instead a long-lived perspective and struggle in Indonesia,” Skolastika Lupitawina, FemFest 2019 leader, said in a statement on Thursday</p>
      <p>This year’s FemFest will also feature discussions of gender equality and the enforcement of women’s rights within the wide spectrum of race, social class, religion and other personal and political intersections.</p>
      <p>This year’s theme is “Made in Indonesia Feminism”.</p>
      <p>“Indonesia has a rich history of women’s movements that are in line with the feminist spirit, although they are not always framed with the term ‘feminism’,” she said.</p>
      <p>FemFest 2019 will include discussions, performances and workshops on various themes such as women and culture, gender identity, feminist groups, being a feminist in university, feminism in politics and feminism in the workforce. </p>
      <p>Discussion panels will feature speakers from various backgrounds, including Andhyta F. Utami, Anis Hidayah, Anindya Restuviani, Dara Nasution, Dena Rachman, Hannah Al Rashid, Tara Basro, Maryam Lee, Ika Vantiani, Bhagavad Sambadha and Tunggal Pawestri.</p>
      <p>Tickets range from Rp 80,000 (US$5.68) to Rp 500,000 and can be accessed <a href="https://www.loket.com/event/femfestid2019">here</a>. (gis)</p>
