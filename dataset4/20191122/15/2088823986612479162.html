      <p>The teenager who was at the target of a massive manhunt in Allegany County Thursday after two bodies were found in a burned house has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree manslaughter.</p>
      <p>State Police had been searching for 17-year-old William J. Larson Jr. after he was spotted at the scene of the fire at 8472 Courtney Hollow Road in Clarksville early Thursday morning. Larson left before troopers arrived.</p>
      <p>Troopers were joined by law enforcement agencies in the hours' long manhunt that ended at about 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>State Police said they were still working to positively identify the victims and their cause of death.</p>
      <p>However, local TV news outlets WGRZ-TV and WKBW-TV were reporting that the victims are presumed to be the teenager's parents, Bill and Lisa Larson, based on the account of a neighbor who was questioned by law enforcement officials.</p>
      <p>Additionally, WGRZ was reporting that, according to court documents the station obtained, the victims were shot on Nov. 5, 16 days before the bodies were found by authorities in the home that the youth shared with his parents.</p>
      <p>William J. Larson Jr. was being held in the Erie County Youth Services Center on $50,000 cash bail/$100,000 bond.</p>
