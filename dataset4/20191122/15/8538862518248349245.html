      <h1>Monster Hunter and Horizon Cross Paths Once Again in Today's Iceborne Update on PS4</h1>
      <h2>Into the Frozen Wilds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/Quintumply" target="_blank">Stephen Tailby</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/horizon_zero_dawn">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">Monster Hunter: World</a> are pretty different games, but they both have one thing in common -- huge, exciting battles against gigantic creatures. It's no wonder that Aloy is returning to Capcom's best-slaying RPG in a brand new crossover event. From today, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world_iceborne">Iceborne</a> players will be able to play a brand new event quest and unlock some cool Horizon-themed gear.</p>
      <p>The first quest in a "multi-part crossover" is called Into the Frozen Wilds, and gives hunters the chance to craft the Stormslinger Prototype, a new Light Bowgun based on Aloy's weapon in the Horizon expansion. You'll face off against a Zinogre in Hoarfrost Reach, and you'll need to be Hunter Rank 24 or above to stand a chance. Completing the quest will also reward you with a weapon pendant fashioned after Aloy's Focus device. The quest is available from now until 10th January, so there's lots of time to give it a shot.</p>
      <p>Will you be playing this Horizon / Iceborne crossover? Stay frosty in the comments below.</p>
