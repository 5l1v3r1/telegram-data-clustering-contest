      <p>Staff at a burning seafront hotel have been praised for their swift actions in getting everyone out quickly.</p>
      <p>The fire, which broke out on Friday morning at a Victorian hotel in Eastbourne, East Sussex, is now under control.</p>
      <p>At the height of the blaze, 12 fire engines were battling the flames at the Claremont hotel.</p>
      <p>Six people were treated for minor injuries and one person was taken to Eastbourne Hospital with breathing difficulties, the ambulance service said.</p>

      <p>Nearby residents have been warned by the fire service to keep doors and windows closed.</p>
      <p>East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service was called at 8.52am to reports of a fire in the hotel’s basement.</p>
      <p>The hotel was evacuated safely and everyone has been accounted for, the fire service confirmed.</p>
      <p>Sea water has been pumped from the beach to be used by firefighters tackling the blaze.</p>
      <p>Incident commander and Assistant Chief Fire Officer Mark Andrews said: “The fire spread from the basement through to the upper floors.</p>
      <p>“There is considerable smoke in the area and we are advising people to keep doors and windows closed.</p>
      <p>“We will now work to ensure that the fire is completely put out.</p>
      <p>“This will take several hours and so the roads in the area are likely to remain closed for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <blockquote>The swift actions of the hotel staff meant everyone got out of the hotel safely, and we thank them for their efforts<cite>Assistant Chief Fire Officer Mark Andrews</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“We would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues from other agencies who have helped us deal with this complex incident.</p>
      <p>“The swift actions of the hotel staff meant everyone got out of the hotel safely, and we thank them for their efforts.”</p>
      <p>The building has been seriously damaged and will need to be examined by building experts before a decision is made about its future, the fire service said.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire will be investigated.</p>
      <p>Guests who were staying at the Claremont hotel have been taken to Eastbourne Town Hall where refreshments and help are available, a spokesman for Eastbourne Borough Council said.</p>
      <p>The spokesman added: “Our Neighbourhood First and housing needs’ teams, and other specialists, are on hand and we are liaising with our partners.”</p>
