      <p>The closures will happen Sunday to Thursday, with the bridge remaining open in both directions on Friday and Saturday evenings. Closures will only affect one direction at a time.</p>
      <p>Pattullo Bridge users are encouraged to use the Port Mann or Alex Fraser bridges as alternatives during the closures. Affected N19 bus trips will be re-routed over the Queensborough Bridge. Affected customers should plan for an additional 30 minutes of travel time. Emergency vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians will be able to cross the bridge in both directions at all times.</p>
      <p>Installation includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seismic activity and wind warning sensors</li>
        <li>Bridge closure devices</li>
        <li>Fibre-optic cables</li>
        <li>Advanced warning lights and signs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When complete, the new system will be able to block entry to the bridge in the event of a seismic or high wind event. The system is scheduled for activation in the coming weeks, following a round of successful full-system tests.</p>
      <p>The southbound traffic towards Surrey will be impacted from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. on Nov. 24-28 and Dec. 1-3.</p>
      <p>The northbound traffic will be impacted Dec. 4-5 and 8-12 from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.</p>
