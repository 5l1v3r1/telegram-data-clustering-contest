      <p><b>David Tennant</b> will play Dennis Nilsen in <b>“Des”</b>, an ITV drama about the Scottish serial killer who murdered numerous young men in London in the late 1970s and early 1980s, reports <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/david-tennant-staring-playing-serial-killer-dennis-nilsen-itv-1203412970/">Variety</a>.</p>
      <p>Based on Masters’ book “Killing for Company,” the three-part series will explore the personal and professional consequences of coming into contact with a man like Nilsen, who died in 2018.</p>
      <p><b>Luke Neal</b> wrote the series about the killer, who murdered boys and young men in his flat. Nilsen went undetected until cops investigated fragments of human flesh and bone clogging the drains.</p>
      <p>The “Doctor Who,” “Broadchurch,” and “Good Omens” actor will star as Nilsen, known as Des, alongside <b>Daniel Mays</b> (“Line of Duty”), who plays the cop investigating the case. <b>Jason Watkins</b> (“The Crown”) is cast as Brian Masters, who penned the serial killer’s biography, with his full cooperation.</p>
      <p>“David Tennant is going to be brilliant as Dennis Nilsen, and with Daniel Mays as Jay and Jason Watkins as Brian, this has an incredible cast to bring this story to screen,” said ITV drama boss Polly Hill, who commissioned the series.</p>
