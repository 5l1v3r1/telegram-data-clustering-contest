      <h1>Bloodbath averted as anti, pro-Oshiomhole protesters clash in Abuja</h1>

      <p>Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja</p>
      <p>Security agencies prevented what could have been a bloodbath on Friday as protesters demanding the sacking of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, and those for him engaged in a free-for-all.</p>
      <p>First to assemble at Blantyre street of the APC National Secretariat were the anti-Oshiomhole protesters.</p>
      <p>They had earlier protested on Thursday. They disrupted vehicular and human movement.</p>
      <p>The situation took a new twist when the pro-Oshiomhole group arrived at the scene leading to a clash.</p>
      <p>They freely used dangerous objects,  big sticks, and stones against each other making passers-by to scamper for safety while houses and offices hurriedly shot their entrances.</p>
      <p>To arrest the situation, policemen stationed on guard at the secretariat fired canisters of teargas to disperse the groups.</p>
      <p>An eye witness said, “They came with all manners of weapons, big stones, and cutlasses, warning everybody along their way to disappear or be killed.</p>
      <p>“We had to run for cover especially when the teargas from the security agents became unbearable.”</p>
      <p>However, normalcy has returned to the area as security agencies have restored order.</p>
