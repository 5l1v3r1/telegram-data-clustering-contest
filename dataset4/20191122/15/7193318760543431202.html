        <b>Holiday replay: Guthrie's Pollard Theatre to present 'It's a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play' for second year</b>
      </p>
      <p>GUTHRIE - He may not be Jimmy Stewart, but for the second straight year, Joshua McGowen will play one of the most iconic movie characters in cinema history, but in a radio play that is actually a theatrical production.</p>
      <p>"It's a great honor. It definitely would be considered a dream role of mine. I think George Bailey is such a complex character. He's not your typical hero that you get in most stories," McGowen said.</p>
      <p>"He's trying to overcome all these obstacles that keep getting in his way. But what he has to learn is that being a hero and fulfilling your dreams may not necessarily mean your own dreams. But it might be serving your fellow human beings. I think he's serving something that's larger than his own ego, and I think that's a real powerful thing. ... He thinks he's in this nightmare, but what he doesn't know is how much more of a nightmare it would be if he wasn't ever there. Once he finally realizes he has been living just the life that he needs, it's a beautiful thing.</p>
      <p>"It's a lot to do in one night, I'll say that," he added with a laugh.</p>
      <p>The story of George Bailey will continue to touch many lives when The Pollard Theatre stages its encore production of “It's a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play” Nov. 29-Dec. 22 on its historic downtown Guthrie stage.</p>
      <p>“When it went over well last year, we kind of breathed a sigh of relief,” said W. Jerome Stevenson, The Pollard's producing artistic director. “You can’t go wrong with that story, and it’s really a question of, ‘Do they want to see it in this style, this new format?’ But that, I think, kind of lends itself to Guthrie and to the time period of the city and the look and feel of it.”</p>

        <b>Shelving a favorite</b>
      </p>
      <p>The theater shelved its traditional yuletide title, “A Territorial Christmas Carol,” last season after the 2018 deaths of founding company member James Ong, who had played Ebenezer Scrooge since 2000, and playwright Stephen P. Scott, who penned the Charles Dickens adaptation for The Pollard in 1987.</p>
      <p>"We felt like there was no way that we would do our version of 'Christmas Carol' - that show on that set that we'd done so many times before - without all of it kind of working on the show ... in a lot of very dark ways. There'd be a great deal of mourning in the show, which is not why people come to a Christmas show. While it may have been cathartic for us, it wasn't gonna be something that we wanted to share with our audience for Christmas. So, it became really clear we needed to get away from it," Stevenson said.</p>
      <p>The search for a holiday title with similar themes led to Joe Landry's adaptation of Frank Capra's classic 1946 film starring Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.</p>
      <p>"The American version of the 'Christmas Carol' story is a 'It's a Wonderful Life.' 'Christmas Carol' has been ... embraced by American audiences and put to good use by American theater companies. But 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a uniquely American story, and I've always been a huge fan of that piece. So, when I came across it as a radio play, I thought, 'This is ideal,'" said Stevenson, who will direct the yuletide show for the second year.</p>
      <p>"This version of it allows us to do kind of what The Pollard does really well, which is focus in on narrative, focus in on relationship between characters."</p>

        <b>Blurring reality</b>
      </p>
      <p>Landry's adaptation follows the familiar film story but frames it as a live 1940s radio broadcast of the tale of George Bailey, a downtrodden small-town businessman who is visited by an angel who shows him what life would have been like if he'd never been born.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of fun because it's set up to where the audience is actually the studio audience during a live recording of the play. So, it's set in the same period, and last year we entered from the back of the house as the actors that are going to be portraying these classic characters. And then there's the radio announcer ... and it's just very much how it would be like listening to a radio play," McGowen said.</p>
      <p>The stage is set with vintage microphones on different platforms, area rugs to muffle any foot shuffling and a Foley artist station with all the tools for creating sound effects. But during the course of the show, the lines between reality and magic blur, especially for McGowen's character, Jake Laurents, who is playing George Bailey.</p>
      <p>"While it takes place inside this radio station, there is something kind of interesting and charming about the way that it is structured, because you get to the latter half of this play and you're 100 percent not sure ... whether they're just kind of speaking the lines or they're living this experience," Stevenson said.</p>

        <b>Transporting audiences</b>
      </p>
      <p>After 30 years of flocking to The Pollard for its "A Territorial Christmas Carol," Stevenson said audiences graciously supported last year's production of "It's a Wonderful Life."</p>
      <p>"The style of it is so familiar and so right in the Guthrie setting ... with this kind of inherent sense of transporting to a different time because you're in Guthrie. There's just something about it that just feels absolutely right. So, we had real success with it last year," Stevenson said.</p>
      <p>He said the plan is to return to "A Territorial Christmas Carol," with "It's a Wonderful Life" perhaps swapping into The Pollard's holiday slot every few years. The theater is using the time away from its traditional title to look at revamping its "Christmas Carol" set for safety and artistic reasons.</p>
      <p>"The set’s really old and it’s a wood set. And it gets stored in a storage unit, and we pull it out and Swiss-cheese it back together. ... We've got safety issues that we want to concern ourselves with. Plus, it might be time to rethink the production and give it a new edge and a new look," Stevenson said. "While I can't say 100 percent that that's what's happening next year, I feel like it's going to be a pretty high priority for a lot of folks ... that we gotta get 'Christmas Carol' back on the boards."</p>
      <p>For McGowen, who played young Scrooge and the miser's cheery nephew Fred for many years in "A Territorial Christmas Carol," the change in yuletide tales has been welcome.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of refreshing to get to do something else, and 'It's a Wonderful Life,' I think, is just as much of an important, classic tale as 'Christmas Carol' is. And the response we've gotten has been wonderful," he said. "I'm very honored and excited to be back at it again and maybe to find even some more elements of George that I didn't have last year. I love Jimmy Stewart ... and as an actor-character piece, it's so rich."</p>
