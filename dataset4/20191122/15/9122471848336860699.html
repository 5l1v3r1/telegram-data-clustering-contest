      <h1>Injury Update For Oklahoma State QB Spencer Sanders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:47:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>No. 21 <a href="https://thespun.com/oklahoma-state">Oklahoma State</a> is on the road at West Virginia this weekend. What should be a tune-up game for Bedlam just got a bit more interesting, as the Cowboys are now without quarterback Spencer Sanders.</p>
      <p>Sanders, an impressive freshman for Mike Gundy, left last weekend’s win over Kansas in the third quarter. Gundy called the move “precautionary” at the time, but it turns out the injury is much more serious than he thought initially.</p>
      <p>He’s dealing with a thumb injury, which requires surgery. Because it occurred this late in the year, he won’t return for the Pokes. The report does leave the door open for Sanders being back for a bowl. At 7-3, the team is already eligible for the postseason.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5647765/osu-football-spencer-sanders-out-after-thumb-surgery"><i>The Oklahoman</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Oklahoma State quarterback Spencer Sanders underwent surgery Monday to repair his injured thumb and will not return during the regular season, <i>The Oklahoman</i> has confirmed.<br/><br/>“Sanders was removed in the third quarter of OSU’s 31-13 win over Kansas last Saturday because of the injury. News of his surgery was first reported Thursday by Dusty Dvoracek of ESPN and the Sports Animal radio network.”</blockquote>
      <p>Dru Brown steps into the role. Luckily for Gundy and his staff, the senior, a former starter at Hawaii, should be a pretty capable replacement. On the season, he is 13-for-18 for 223 yards and three touchdowns. In two seasons with the Rainbow Warriors, he threw for 5,273 yards, 37 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.</p>
      <p>Spencer Sanders was a dynamic dual-threat weapon for the Cowboys, throwing for 2,065 yards, with a very solid 8.4 yards per attempt, and 62.8 completion percentage. He has 16 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. On the ground, he is second on the team with 625 yards and two scores, behind superstar back Chuba Hubbard.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, Oklahoma State lost top receiver Tylan Wallace, who had 903 yards and eight touchdowns through the first two months of the year. It is going to be tough sledding for the Pokes against the Sooners next weekend.</p>
