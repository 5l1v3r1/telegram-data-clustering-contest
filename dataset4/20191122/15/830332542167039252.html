      <p>Verona - Tom Brunner, age 48, of Verona, passed away on November 19, 2019.</p>
      <p>He was born on April 5, 1971, in Madison, Wis.</p>

He was happiest when he was fishing and hunting and being with his friends. He thoroughly enjoyed his dogs Candy and Cody and missed them greatly when they were gone. Tom was outgoing and friendly with a great sense of humor. He loved his family and will be deeply missed.</p>
      <p>Tom is survived by his parents, Neal (Joann) Brunner of Madison, Wis., and Elizabeth Brunner of Madison, Wis., his sister, Cathy (Bob, Jr.) Uecker and their daughter, Tom's niece, Emily Uecker, all of Milwaukee, Wis., his aunt, Bonnie Ackerman, of Madison, Wis., and many more aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>
