      <h3>Time to change it up.</h3>
      <p>The Rundown is a new system that developer 10 Chambers Collective hopes will rejuvenate its upcoming title, <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/gtfo/">GTFO</a>.</i></p>
      <p>The Rundown is essentially <i>GTFO</i>‘s menu system, providing new, rotating challenges to be overcome by players, a new video explains.</p>
      <p>“Each work order in the Rundown represents an expedition into a different part of the Complex where the environment, the population of monsters, the objective, and other conditions can all be vastly different and offer diverse gaming experiences,” said 10 Chambers Collective’s Simon Viklund.</p>
      <p>The Rundown is the developers attempt to “keep GTFO dynamic while also compelling the game’s community to focus on a common set of expeditions,” 10 Chambers Collective continued. “Gamers will be always able to come back to GTFO for fresh new challenges that they can take on with their hardcore gamer friends.”</p>
      <p>The news about The Rundown comes as <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/gtfo/">GTFO</a> </i>prepares to enter its early access phase; that’ll take place later in 2019 on Windows PC via Steam.</p>
