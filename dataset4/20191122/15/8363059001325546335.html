      <h1>Argos Undercuts Amazon, Offers the Lowest Price on the Ring Doorbell 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:40:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>When it comes to devices made by Amazon, and then sold on Amazon, you'd think that Amazon would have all the best discounts, right? Well you'd be wrong, because Argos is the one that somehow managed to claim that title where the Ring Doorbell 2 is concerned.</p>
      <p>Amazon currently has the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ring-Doorbell-Two-Way-Detection-Connected/dp/B0758975BR/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ring+2&amp;qid=1574426712&amp;smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;sr=8-1">Ring Doorbell 2 on sale for £119</a>, which is £60 off the normal price. Not a bad deal, to be honest, though it's been beaten by Argos. <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7527579?utm_campaign=11553376&amp;cmpid=COJUN&amp;cjsurferid=200303355531691839%3ASCxhOCvTB5R7&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=Future+Publishing+Ltd&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cjevent=f1a01f360d2511ea804900f20a180510&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10151&amp;_%24ja=tsid%3A11674%7Cprd%3A6361382&amp;utm_term=3486349&amp;referredURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F7527579&amp;referrer=COJUN">Argos is still selling the Ring 2 for £119</a>, but that price also includes the wireless Ring Chime that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ring-Chime-enabled-indoor-doorbell/dp/B0765D8TXQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ring+chime&amp;qid=1574426931&amp;sr=8-1">normally costs an extra £29</a>.</p>
      <p>The Chime is essentially an extender for the Ring doorbell. You stick it in a room, connect it to your WiFi network, and whenever someone rings the doorbell it'll notify you without you needing to take your phone out of your pocket.</p>
      <p>Obviously Argos charges for delivery, while Amazon doesn't, but even if you don't opt for the free click &amp; collect option <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7527579?utm_campaign=11553376&amp;cmpid=COJUN&amp;cjsurferid=200303355531691839%3ASCxhOCvTB5R7&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=Future+Publishing+Ltd&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cjevent=f1a01f360d2511ea804900f20a180510&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10151&amp;_%24ja=tsid%3A11674%7Cprd%3A6361382&amp;utm_term=3486349&amp;referredURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F7527579&amp;referrer=COJUN">you're still saving yourself a bit of money</a>.
