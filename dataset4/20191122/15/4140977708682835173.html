          </p>
          <p>Back after a hiatus of two weeks as we got done with the final round of qualifiers for Euro 2020, Ligue 1 return with a resounding clash which will feature league leaders PSG in play. Undoubtedly the most well rounded and complete setup in the land of the league, the side are befittingly sitting in the echelons of the points tally, a spot they’ll be looking to hammer down in their favour come today.</p>
          <p>Currently having an eight point lead in their artillery, PSG make an advent into today’s contest looking to further extend their advantage against a dwindling Lille side. In fifth place ahead of today’s impending encounter, Lille have floundering recently, regressing in form to go on a downward spiral to garner just the two wins from their last five outings.</p>

                <p>The run of form has seen them fall from challenging for a spot in the annuls of the league to clutching at straws with their most recent encounter seeing them draw 0-0 with Metz to be handed out their fourth draw in 13 encounters. Elsewhere, PSG managed to turnover their 2-1 defeat to Dijon with a scrappy 2-1 win over Brest the last time around, a result which showed that the side are far from the complete package.</p>
                <p>With their being blatant gaping holes in PSG’s setup, Lille will be well aware that the slightest bit of hammer on their opponents today can make this an edge of the seat thriller and see the side salvage something from the contest. With the ramifications for both the sides enormous from this contest, this match looks to be a closely contested one with the finest of margins coming into play here.</p>

                            <p>
                              <b>PSG</b>

                            <h3>PSG Vs LIL Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With Keylor Navas having sustained an injury recently, PSG’s Sergo Rico is all set to come out and earn a spot in his side’s playing 11 for this imminent tie. The man between the sticks comes into our side not only owing due to is selection which is at just 1.5% for this encounter but the fact that she’s an acumen imbued player as well, someone who is bound to herald our way a slew of save points. </p>
                            <h3>PSG Vs LIL Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Although PSG have gone onto concede in both of their previous two matches with the side’s gaping holes in defence seeing them pick up the pieces as side’s exploit their vulnerabilities, if anyone is going to come out of this one with a cleansheet its them. The home side have let in a mere 8 goals till now in 13 encounters, coming across as a relatively disciplined side for the majority of their sorties to see us move in with a duo from the side for this one in the form of Colin Dagba and Abdou Diallo.</p>
                            <p>From the other meanwhile, we have gone in with a partnership of picks as well with their fullbacks being our picks for this encounter. Lille will be massively depending on the duo of Reinildo Mandava and Mamet Zeki Celik to provide astute support to their wide attacking players and keep piling the pressure on PSG today, something we envisage them doing persistently.</p>
                            <h3>PSG Vs LIL Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Heavily dominated by the picks from Lille, our selecting four players from the side for this one might come as a surprise but there is a very strong reasoning behind our picks as well. The likelihood of this one being a high scoring affair is extremely high with PSG set to play this one with some of their star performers given the upcoming Champions League fixture against Real Madrid, something which will buoy Lille to go for the kill when these two meet.</p>
                            <p>With their side’s leading scorer and striker out for this one, the onus will grow on Jonathan Ikone to come up with an electric performance for his side. The player will be allowed to express himself freely today, being handed over a free hand to try and perturb PSG which should see him involved in all of his side’s sorties. </p>
                            <p>He will be accompanied aptly by Jonathan Bamba in this facet while Yusuf Yazici and Boubakary Soumare will be asked to not hold transition the ball from defence to attack but also hold fort for the side in defence and screen PSG’s attacking attempts. From the home side meanwhile we have just the one pick come in for us in the form of Leandro Paredes.</p>
                            <h3>PSG Vs LIL Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>Having recovered from his injury, the likelihood of Kylian Mbappe, the side’s leading goal scorer with the five goals being involved today is extremely plausible to see him become a regulation choice for this component of our Dream 11 side.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Mbappe earns the spot of captain of our unit as well whilst Diallo is the vice-captain.</p>
