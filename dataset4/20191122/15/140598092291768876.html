      <h3>What is the team news?</h3>
      <h4>Sheffield United</h4>
      <p>On-loan Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson will miss out against his parent club Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old is on loan at Bramall Lane from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side and the terms of the agreement do not allow him to play.</p>
      <p>John Egan is a doubt after the defender suffered a clash of heads with Andreas Cornelius during the Republic of Ireland's 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday.</p>
      <p><b>Sheffield United provisional squad:</b> Moore, Baldock, Stevens, Fleck, Egan, O'Connell, Basham, Freeman, Jagielka, Lundstram, Osborn, Besic, McBurnie, Robinson, Norwood, Mousset, Sharp, McGoldrick.</p>
      <h4>Manchester United</h4>
      <p>Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay will be absent for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Pogba (foot) and McTominay (ankle) face several more weeks out, with the midfield duo joined on the sidelines by Marcos Rojo (muscle).</p>
      <p>Nemanja Matic, Luke Shaw and Axel Tuanzebe are available but lacking match fitness, while Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Diogo Dalot are stepping up their rehabilitation. Ashley Young returns from suspension.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester United provisional squad: </b>De Gea, Romero, Grant, Wan-Bissaka, Young, Jones, Laird, Lindelof, Tuanzebe, Maguire, Shaw, Williams, Fred, Garner, Gomes, Matic, James, Lingard, Mata, Pereira, Chong, Greenwood, Martial, Rashford.</p>
      <h3>What are they saying?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer feels no extra pressure with highly-rated Mauricio Pochettino on the market following this week's shock exit from Tottenham:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Sorry to disappoint but it's not going be about Jose or Mauricio. "I can start with it's good to have Jose back definitely - especially for you guys, maybe for me because you can talk and write about everything else. "And for Mauricio, it's always sad when one of your colleagues, a good man, you lose your job before Christmas. It's never nice to see so I just wish him all the best. "In football you can never be surprised at anything, or you can't be shocked at anything. For me, I've just got to focus on us."</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Asked if United links to Pochettino brings pressure, Solskjaer said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"No, it doesn't bother me at all. "I've got the best job in the world and I am sure if you're in a job or if you're out of a job and you're a manager, you'd want this job. "So, it doesn't really matter, whatever happens around it. I've got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can. "Obviously I speak with Ed (Woodward, executive vice-chairman), speak with the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward and that doesn't change if some other clubs change their managers."</blockquote>
      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sheffield United - 5/2</li>
        <li>Draw - 9/4</li>
        <li>Manchester United - 5/4</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>At Bramall Lane, against a team playing entertaining, attacking football under Chris Wilder, Man Utd will not have things their own way. Indeed, the Sheffield club are undefeated in their last five Premier League games - DWDWD. <br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Sheffield United 1 Manchester United 0.</p>
