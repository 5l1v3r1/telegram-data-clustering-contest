      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverZoo/">Denver Zoo</a> created quite a buzz when they posted this adorable video of a newborn <a href="https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/quiz/what-do-you-know-about-flamingos">baby Chilean flamingo</a>.</p>
      <p>Keepers found that this little chick was in an egg that was laid late in the season. With the cold weather in Denver, it didn't have a great chance of making it.</p>
      <p>So, they took action to save the bird's life and brought it in to the egg incubators at their Aviation Propagation Center.</p>

      <p>Keepers work with the flamingo to make sure its legs are getting stronger. In their latest video above, you can see that it is growing quickly.</p>
      <p>The chick was born weighing 0.2 pounds and now weighs five times as much.</p>
      <p>"Our little man has grown!" the zoo posted. "He now weighs 1 full lb and is SO mobile! These days, his little workouts take him all over the Avian Propagation Center and HE's doing the chasing."</p>
