      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/m/monisha-bharadwaj/" target="_blank">Monisha Bharadwaj</a></address>
      <p>Gujarati cooking is delicate, largely vegetarian and full of unusual ingredients and combinations. Vegetables are not smothered in spices; instead they are lightly cooked, with just a few spices that bring out their freshness and unique taste.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes |<b> Cooking time: </b>20 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>four </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp black mustard seeds</li>
        <li>2 fresh green chillies, cut in half lengthways, deseeded and stalks left on</li>
        <li>1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½  medium cabbage, finely shredded</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, peeled and coarsely grated</li>
        <li>Rotis, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Warm the sunflower oil in a heavy-based frying pan on a high heat. Add the mustard seeds and wait until they pop, then add the chillies and ginger. Stir for a few seconds, then sprinkle in the turmeric and stir.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage and carrots, season with salt and stir to combine, then stir-fry on a high heat for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
        <li>Pour in about 3-4 tbsp of cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pan and cook for 10 minutes or so until the vegetables are cooked and the water has evaporated. If there is some water left at the bottom, cook, uncovered, on a high heat for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with rotis.</li>
      </ol>
