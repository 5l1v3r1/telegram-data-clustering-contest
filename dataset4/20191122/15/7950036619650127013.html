      <p>A Palestinian wounded in an Israeli strike that killed eight members of his family has died, the health ministry in the Hamas-run strip said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Abu Malhous al-Sawarka, 40, succumbed after being wounded in "the massacre in which eight members of a family died when they were targeted in their homes," ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It said he was the brother of Rasmi Abu Malhous who was killed when his home was hit by an airstrike on November 14.</p>
      <p>Five children and Rasmi's two wives were also killed.</p>
      <p>Israel has pledged to investigate the incident, saying that their intelligence reports had indicated "no civilians were expected to be harmed".</p>
      <p>Israel described Rasmi as an Islamic Jihad commander, but Gaza residents have suggested it may have been a case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>The three-day flareup began when Israel killed a senior Islamic Jihad official in Gaza on November 12.</p>
      <p>The Islamist group, which is closely allied with Gaza's rulers Hamas, subsequently fired more than 450 rockets at Israel.</p>
      <p>During the confrontation Israeli forces attacked dozens of targets in the enclave.</p>
      <p>Palestinian officials said 35 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 wounded. There were no Israeli fatalities.</p>
