      <p>Davido’s road manager, Obama is definitely  in a tight fix as he watches his apartment gutted by fire.</p>
      <p>In a video that surfaced online, we can see the high-rise building on fire at Primewater Gardens 2, Lekki, Lagos and report has it that the affected apartment belongs to Davido’s road manager, Obama.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is unknown at the time of filing this report, but the men of the Lagos State Fire Department were on site trying to put off the fire.</p>
      <p>However, they may be a delay in putting off the fire as the fire service hose seems to be leaking profusely.</p>
