      <p>AN 18-month sentence imposed on a man caught storing guns and ammunition belonging to dissident republicans was unduly lenient, the Court of Appeal has ruled.</p>
      <p>But with Edward Corr having already served a term behind bars for weapons he claims he was pressured into keeping, judges decided not to order his return to jail.</p>
      <p>Lord Justice Stephens said it would unfair to expose him to the risk of a significantly heavier prison sentence on a new basis never advanced at trial.</p>
      <p>The verdict came in a challenge mounted by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</p>
      <p>Corr (40) was arrested after police searched a shed at his Foxes Glen home in Dunmurry in October 2016.</p>
      <p>Bags found contained two blank calibre pistols, magazines, ammunition and a Yugoslavian Skorpion M48 submachine gun.</p>
      <p>Corr claimed he had been threatened at gunpoint to store the weapons six weeks earlier by a man who said he was on official Oglaigh na hEireann business.</p>
      <p>During police interviews he said he had not slept for nearly six weeks and feared being shot.</p>
      <p>In May 2018 he admitted possessing firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life and possession of a prohibited weapon.</p>
      <p>A judge at Belfast Crown Court imposed an 18-month sentence for the offences - half to be served in prison.</p>
      <p>The DPP appealed the term.</p>
      <p>It was contended that the trial judge was wrong in finding exceptional circumstances to justify departing from the five-year minimum for the offences.</p>
      <p>Ruling on the appeal, Lord Justice Stephens agreed with the original assessment of exceptional circumstances, based on the pressure placed on Corr as a vulnerable individual.</p>
      <p>However, he identified a failure to place sufficient emphasis on the specific criminal intent linked to a haul including a "lethal, deadly" submachine gun.</p>
      <p>"These weapons and ammunition were possessed by the respondent with the intent to enable members of a dissident terrorist organisation to endanger life," he pointed out.</p>
      <p>A sentence of three years and six months would have been appropriate, the court concluded.</p>
      <p>But appeal judges also held that the prosecution was raising an entirely new case.</p>
