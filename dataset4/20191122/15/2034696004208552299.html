      <p>The particular item of clothing became synonymous with the show across its first season, and the show’s star has now revealed that it has a particularly strong meaning to her in real life.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i><a href="https://www.allure.com/story/zendaya-cover-interview-2020">Allure</a></i>, Zendaya makes the link between the hoodie and her late grandfather. “When I was 11, my grandfather passed, and we had all his old clothes.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would be cool if we made [it clear that] the hoodie was Rue’s [late] dad’s hoodie. [I wanted to capture] that attachment that you have to inanimate objects when somebody passes.”</p>

      <p>The star went on to say that the hoodie has become reflective of Rue’s mood in any particular episode of the show.</p>
      <p>“It was written in the script that Rue had this big hoodie,” she says. “You can tell when she’s having a good day or feels good because her hoodie is not covering her entirely, and then when she’s not feeling it, she’s basically hiding in this giant hoodie.”</p>
      <p>Zendaya recently revealed how <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/zendaya-reveals-shooting-euphoria-gave-anxiety-every-week-2555827">the release of <i>Euphoria</i> gave her “anxiety every week”</a>.</p>
      <p>“<i>Euphoria</i> was eight months of my life, and now that it’s done I’m like, ‘Fuck,'” she told <i>ELLE</i>. “You put your shit out there, and it’s a really terrifying thing to do. It’s out for the world to see—it’s so fucking weird.”</p>
