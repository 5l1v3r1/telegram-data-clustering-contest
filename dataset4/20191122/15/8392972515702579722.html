      <p>TV fans will face a dilemma tonight, when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> airs one hour later than usual.</p>
      <p>On Friday (November 22), the BBC soap will air at 9pm to make way for an extended edition of Question Time.</p>

      </p>
      <p>From 7pm to 9pm, presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/antiques-roadshow-star-drunk-on-air/">Fiona Bruce</a> will introduce a live debate from Sheffield, with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Scottish National Party Nicola Sturgeon MSP, Leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The debate is an important one in the run-up to the election on December 12.</p>
      <p>But the big decision for some viewers won't be who to vote for... It'll be what to watch afterwards at 9pm!</p>

      <p>With EastEnders running late at 9pm, fans are faced with a tricky choice - sticking with the BBC soap, or watching <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> on ITV or <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/">Gogglebox</a> on C4!</p>

      <p>In Easties, Max Branning will impulsively <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-spoilers-max-proposes-to-ruby-entertainment-daily/">propose to girlfriend Ruby Allen</a>, who is starting to feel the age gap after he was mistaken for her dad...</p>

      <p>One pointed out that, although the BBC soap airs later in the UK, Ireland's RTE One will broadcast at the usual time.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "UK viewers may want to avoid Twitter completely between 8pm and 9pm at the risk of seeing spoilers for tonight's episode.</p>
      <p>"This is because Ireland's RTE One will broadcast #EastEnders an hour earlier than BBC One, where it has moved (once more) due to Question Time."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I'm sorry. Nine. Nine O'Clock. EastEnders, Gogglebox AND I'm A Celeb are all on at nine. What am I meant to do? #EastEnders."</p>

      <p>A third seethed: "And they have got the bloody cheek to move #EastEnders back to 9pm #whataliberty."</p>
      <p>What <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-furious-the-soap-has-been-cancelled-for-football-again/">channel</a> will you choose?</p>
