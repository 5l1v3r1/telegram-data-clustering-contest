      <p>The Trump administration would allow some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant, Huawei , <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-granted-license-to-export-mass-market-software-to-huawei/article30046834.ece">reports</a> <i>The Hindu</i></p>
      <p>Microsoft Corp which recently got a $10 billion contract from <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/insta/amazon-to-appeal-pentagons-decision-to-award-10-billion-cloud-computing-deal-to-microsoft">Department of Defense</a> called the ‘Jedi’ said on Thursday (21 November) it had been granted a license from the US government to export software to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.</p>
      <p>“On November 20, the US Department of Commerce granted Microsoft’s request for a license to export mass-market software to Huawei. We appreciate the Department’s action in response to our request,” a Microsoft spokesman told Reuters via email.</p>
      <p>Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist over national security concerns six months ago but Trump said this week, US would allow some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant.</p>
      <p>Microsoft declined to comment beyond its statement on which products had been approved, and the Commerce Department declined to comment.</p>
      <p>An analyst from Wedbush Securities Dan Ives, said, “This will be a major relief for Huawei after an arduous period with large technology players like Microsoft, Google and others restricted on the platform.”</p>
      <p>But the granting of the license to Microsoft met with opposition and a bipartisan group of 15 senators asked the Commerce Department to suspend the issuing of licenses, saying it could threaten ‘US security’.</p>
      <p>The senators wrote a letter to Trump on Thursday (21 November) said, “The administration should halt issuing licenses until it provides Congress a report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat.”</p>
