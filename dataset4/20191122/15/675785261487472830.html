      <p>He then gets through two whole chillies before beginning to visibly struggle.</p>
      <p>Lara can be seen coughing heavily as he appears to starting choking. He dropped onto the sofa and seems to be having difficulties breathing.</p>
      <p>One of the women in the video rush to help him, and pat him on the back as he continues coughing.</p>
      <p>His sister and co-star Yazmin released a statement saying her brother is on the mend.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Hugo Lara is in stable condition. We didn't think that this would get so out of control, and we will show you the video we recorded... so that you can see what really happened."</p>
      <p>The YouTuber wrote to fans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> and said he is “feeling better”.</p>
      <p>An account called 'lylapas' said: “I am glad to hear you are well, if I were your mother I would slap you after scaring me."</p>
      <p>Another user name Angeles Duran wrote: “Nobody broadcasts these challenges live because they are edited, you lack experience.”</p>
