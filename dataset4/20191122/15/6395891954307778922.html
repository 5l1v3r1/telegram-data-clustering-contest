      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A new report says incidents of child neglect in group homes in Massachusetts have increased by 55% in the past year.</p>
      <p>The report from the state's Child Advocate's office says that at least 184 children were neglected in group homes during the last fiscal year. More than 10% of the children were 11 years old or younger.</p>
      <p>Child Advocate Maria Mossaides tells The Boston Globe that the term "neglect" applies to a wide range of cases including situations when children didn't receive necessary medical care.</p>
      <p>Mossaides' office says five group homes had three or more reports of abuse or neglect. The office found that many of those homes had trouble with recruiting and retaining staff.</p>
      <p>Mossaides' says that when the economy is better, there is a "high turnover."</p>
