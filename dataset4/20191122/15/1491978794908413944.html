        <i>Hearing told inquiry may be delayed beyond April due to ‘diabolical’ failure to provide key evidence</i>
      </p>
      <p>A public inquiry into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester">Manchester</a> Arena bombing may be delayed due to a “diabolical” failure by police to provide crucial witness statements more than two years after the attack.</p>
      <p>A preliminary hearing was told that the inquiry could be pushed beyond April next year because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/greater-manchester">Greater Manchester</a> police (GMP) had not provided key evidence on time.</p>
      <p>Fiona Barton QC, representing GMP, made a public apology for the delay to about 30 relatives of the victims who were present at Manchester Town Hall on Friday. Looking over to the benches where the bereaved were seated, she said: “May I turn to the families and apologise profusely for the delay.”</p>
      <p>From across the room one relative responded: “Not accepted.” Stephen Howe, whose wife Alison, 45, was among the 22 who died in the suicide attack, said GMP’s response was “diabolical” as it came more than two years after the bombing.</p>
      <p>The Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people and injured hundreds more by detonating a rucksack bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. The bomber’s younger brother, Hashem Abedi, will go on trial in January. He denies 22 counts of murder.</p>
      <p>Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, told the hearing witness statements relating to command and control issues were first requested from 12 key individuals at GMP in April. They were told to provide them in August, but only six have been given so far, those having been emailed last night.</p>
      <p>Greaney also said there was a second problem with “gaps” in the 550 hours of radio transmission recordings from the night of the bombing provided by GMP.</p>
      <p>Barton said the evidence had not been provided for a variety of reasons, including an officer going on sick leave and IT issues at GMP, but rejected a suggestion it was due to a “lack of candour”.</p>
      <p>The retired high court judge Sir John Saunders, chairing the inquiry, said: “No comments should be made about lack of candour until we see the statements. If there’s delay and it is due to GMP I have no doubt there will be extremely extensive public criticism of GMP.</p>
      <p>“What I’m absolutely insistent on is this inquiry has to start on 6 April. It is simply not fair to the families or to anyone else or to Manchester in general.”</p>
