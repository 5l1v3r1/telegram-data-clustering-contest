      <h1>Henry Cavill auditioned for James Bond but was told he was a 'little chubby'</h1>

      <p>He may have been the "Man of Steel," but Henry Cavill says he hasn't always been in the best shape.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">a recent interview with Men's Health, </a>the actor revealed that in the mid-'00s he tried out for the role of James Bond.</p>
      <p>The screen test involved Cavill walking out of a bathroom wrapped in a towel.</p>
      <p>It didn't go well, he said.</p>
      <p>"I probably could have prepared better," he said. "I remember the director, Martin Campbell, saying, 'Looking a little chubby there, Henry.' I didn't know how to train or diet. And I'm glad Martin said something, because I respond well to truth. It helps me get better."</p>
      <p>The role instead went to Daniel Craig and Cavill became one of the stars the Showtime historical series "The Tudors."</p>
      <p>He later became Superman in the DC films, but before that he had to show off his physique in the 2011 film "Immortals."</p>
      <p>"It was my first experience working on a movie and having my shirt off for most of the damn time," Cavill said.</p>
      <p>The actor went on a strict six-month diet and did extensive martial-arts training.</p>
      <p>"It's very emotionally taxing," he said. "When you add the lack of food and the pressure on top of that, it's tough."</p>
      <p>He also kicked things up a notch for his starring role as Superman in "Man of Steel."</p>
      <p>Cavill said he takes seriously playing such physical characters.</p>
      <p>"I know what it feels like to go from out of shape to in shape [afterward] I'll look at myself like, 'Man, well done,'" he said. "It's not like I'm a golden god â€” I'm just proud of what I achieved."</p>
