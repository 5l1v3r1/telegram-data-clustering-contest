      <p>Retaining the tricolour is a red-line issue for a united Ireland, Mary-Lou McDonald has claimed.</p>
      <p>The Sinn Féin president believes there would be a "huge economic dividend and potential" in reunification and it would provide a chance to properly deal with healthcare across the island.</p>
      <p>However, she ruled out altering the Irish flag to perhaps include a red hand to reflect the unionist tradition.</p>
      <p>"The tricolour is our flag, I think it's inclusive it represents the green and the orange, Amhrán na bhFiann is our national anthem," she told Newstalk's <i>Pat Kenny Show</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>I am an Irish republican, I am a Fenian I come from that stock, so that's my flag.</blockquote>
      <p>She described Brexit a "constitutional earthquake" which will change everything on both sides of the border.</p>
      <p>Separately, Ms McDonald refused to condemn the attempted murder of Arlene Foster's father during the Troubles.</p>
      <p>The current leader of the DUP was present when her father, John Kelly, was shot in 1979.</p>
      <p>While Ms McDonald said it was "wrong" that Ms Foster had witnessed the attack, she said she would not be going down the "rabbit hole" of condemnation.</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald said: "The politics of condemnation is a rabbit hole that I will not go down because it becomes a tit-for-tat, you-said-I-said, I think that serves nobody's interest</p>
      <blockquote>Then it becomes a tennis match between very, very hurt and very, very damaged people and communities and I am not playing that game, I think it's dishonourable.</blockquote>
      <p>Asked how often she speaks with Ms Foster given the fact that the Assembly has not been up and running for almost three years, she said: "We have contact that is sometimes by telephone, more often it's face to face," said Ms McDonald.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Sinn Féin has revealed that Michelle O'Neill held on to her post as the party's vice president with two-thirds of the vote last Saturday.</p>
