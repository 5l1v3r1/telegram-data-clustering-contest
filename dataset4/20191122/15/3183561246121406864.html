      <p>We find ourselves in an odd time when automakers are putting out their own camouflaged “spy shots” of prototype cars to drum up pre-release hype. As an editor, I’m fine with this; it’s less freelance money I have to spend buying photos. But it is a bit of a strange practice, and most of the time I don’t really care. Unless it’s a new sports car from <a href="https://jalopnik.com/tag/maserati">Maserati</a> that seems to have very familiar bones. Then we care.</p>
      <p>We don’t know much about this prototype yet, except that it looks like it’s based on our beloved <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-alfa-romeo-4c-is-one-step-closer-to-death-1839860613">Alfa Romeo 4C</a>—more for testing and early development purposes than for the platform of the actual car itself, would be my guess.</p>
      <p>Some have speculated it’s going to be the new <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-maserati-alfieri-concept-better-be-the-next-grantur-1535509504">Alfieri</a>, although this clearly isn’t the front-engined coupe concept we saw several years ago. It’s something new and may get a new name.</p>

      <p>We do know that <a href="https://jalopnik.com/maserati-pivots-to-evs-alfa-romeo-scaling-down-and-no-1839532334">Fiat Chrysler’s brands are going through a pretty big shakeup</a> with no new Fiat cars planned, a downsizing at Alfa Romeo and a pivot to electrification at Maserati. Whether this thing is the Alfieri or not, that car is said to come as either a plug-in hybrid or fully electric car.</p>
      <p>And Maserati itself says this mule packs a new engine developed in-house as they move away from Ferrari motors. The exact phrasing Maserati uses is “the forefather of a new family of engines integrated exclusively on the vehicles of the Brand.”</p>
      <p>(They capitalised the B in brand, not me. I wouldn’t do that to you.)</p>
      <p>My educated guess is it’s some kind of hybrid V6 or hybrid V8 that will see duty in the rest of the range, as a stopgap to the full electric powertrains that FCA clearly wants for this automaker. As a believer in performance hybrids, I’m eager to see what it can do.</p>
      <p>The only other concrete thing Maserati says is that this car will be unveiled next May. If you can think that far ahead about life, and I largely cannot anymore, get excited.</p>
