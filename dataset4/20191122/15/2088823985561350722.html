      <h1>Lake Ontario outflows to continue higher than planned through June 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:17:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">tprohaska@buffnews.com</a></address>
      <p>The board that controls outflows from Lake Ontario announced Friday that it will be allowed to keep exceeding the limits at least until June.</p>
      <p>Reacting to long-term forecasts of more high water, the International Joint Commission has allowed the International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board to continue letting out more water than the Plan 2014 water management plan allows.</p>
      <p>New York State <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/11/18/state-asks-50-million-in-damages-in-revised-lawsuit-over-lake-ontario-flooding/">has sued the IJC</a> to recover the more than $50 million from flood damage in 2017 and this year. The state has spent more than $300 million in damage reimbursements for local governments and property owners, as well as infrastructure projects designed to prevent future floods.</p>
      <p>Record-high water levels began within weeks of Plan 2014 taking effect in December 2016. The board insists that's just a coincidence.</p>
      <p>"The board stresses that while an outflow strategy can influence water levels, the main driver is weather, especially when wet conditions are as extreme as they were in 2017 and 2019," the board's statement said.</p>
