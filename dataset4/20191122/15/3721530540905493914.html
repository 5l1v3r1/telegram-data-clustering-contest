      <p>Another popular Twitch streamer is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/8/2/20751800/ninja-mixer-stream-viewers-twitch-average-lollapalooza">making the switch to a new platform</a>. Jeremy “Disguised Toast” Wang, who gained popularity streaming games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20963080/hearthstone-battlegrounds-open-beta-launch-date"><i>Hearthstone</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/15/20913498/teamfight-tactics-set-2-new-units-riot-games-league-of-legends-stream"><i>Teamfight Tactics</i></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DisguisedToast/status/1197892496694472704?s=20">announced on Friday morning</a> that he will start streaming exclusively on Facebook Gaming. As part of his move, Wang will be donating all of the proceeds from his first month of donations on Facebook Gaming to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.</p>
      <p>Wang started out on Twitch as a <i>Hearthstone </i>streamer and pro player who wore a mask shaped like a piece of toast. Eventually he removed the mask and started streaming other games and has since become one of the most popular streamers for auto battler games like <i>Teamfight Tactics</i>.</p>
      <p>Wang, who is represented by United Talent, is also part of the streaming group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDK9qD5DAQML-pzrtA7A4oA">Offline TV</a> which also has members like Pokimane, Scarra and LilyPichu. These creators stream everything from IRL music streams, to <i>League of Legends</i>, to <i>Fortnite</i>, but as of yet there’s no announcement that anyone else from Offline TV is changing platforms and moving away from Twitch.</p>
      <p>With this move to Facebook, Wang joins a growing number of streamers leaving Twitch for other platforms. Popular content creator and <i>Fortnite </i>streamer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20944829/courage-streamer-youtube-exclusive-deal-jack-dunlop">Jack “Courage” Dunlop moved to YouTube last month</a>, while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/24/20930650/shroud-moving-streaming-mixer">Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/1/20750405/ninja-twitch-mixer-exclusivity-tyler-blevins">Tyler “Ninja” Blevins</a> have both moved to Mixer other the last year. Thus far, Wang is the highest profile streamer to make the move from Twitch to Facebook, though Facebook Gaming’s streaming section has grown considerably over the least few months.</p>
      <p>Wang’s first livestream on his new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaming/disguisedtoast">Facebook Gaming channel</a> is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. ET on Friday, Nov. 22.</p>
