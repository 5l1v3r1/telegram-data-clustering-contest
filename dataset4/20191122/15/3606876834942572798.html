      <p>While they have a <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28526926/arnold-schwarzenegger-sylvester-stallone-dolph-lundgren/">lot of fun together </a>now, and are even <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28597094/sylvester-stallone-dolph-lundgren-new-tv-show/">collaborating on new action drama series </a>The International, Stallone recently admitted that <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29150881/sylvester-stallone-hated-dolph-lundgren/">he wasn't Lundgren's biggest fan when they first met </a>. "He was like the real Terminator," Sly said, recalling the moment that Lundgren was cast to play Drago. "And I go, I hate this friggen' guy. I hate him! He's just too good lookingtoo perfect. And if I loathe him, I'm sure the world will."</p>

        <p>A version of the rivalry that Stallone and Lundgren depicted on-screen also plays out in One Night, which Stallone co-produced through his company Balboa Productions.</p>
        <p>The documentary is about real-life boxing giants <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a27356523/anthony-joshua-boxing-top-moves/">Anthony Joshua </a>and <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/a29664185/andy-ruiz-jr-weight-loss-transformation-boxing-heavyweight/">Andy Ruiz Jr. </a>, and follows the epic showdown between the two fighters earlier this year which saw <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a27841416/anthony-joshua-doesnt-remember-andy-ruiz-fight/">Ruiz knock Joshua out </a>for the first time in his professional career, seizing his WBA, WBO, and IBF titles in the process.</p>
        <p>"He just decided, you know what? I'm going to rewrite this fing book," Stallone says of the history-making moment in the film. "That's when the pure savagery kicks in... Andy smells blood and he smells defeat... It just wasn't supposed to happen, but it did."</p>
