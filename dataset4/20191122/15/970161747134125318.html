      <h1>Taskmaster poached by Channel 4 from Dave as hit game show makes big move</h1>

      <p>Get ready for UK TV’s biggest channel hop since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/great-british-bake-off/">The </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/great-british-bake-off/">Great British Bake Off</a> departed the BBC in 2017.</p>
      <p>Taskmaster, the beloved and very silly Dave show where celebrities and comedians are set a series of increasingly bizarre tasks, has been bought by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/channel-4/">Channel 4</a>.</p>
      <p>The Avalon Television-produced series will be screened on 4 from 2020, with a six-series deal across the next three years having been confirmed. Repeats will air on E4.</p>
      <p>Its ninth series aired on Dave back in September, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/greg-davies/">Greg Davies</a> and Taskmaster creator Alex Horne serving as hosts.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve had an amazing nine series on Dave and I’d like to thank UKTV for letting us do such ridiculous things for so long,’ Horne said in an official statement (see his separate Twitter post about the switch above).</p>

      <p>‘It seems like the right time to move to a channel with a broader audience and I can reassure people who like the show that it won’t be changing one bit and I’ll still be forced to do things no one should ever have to do.’</p>
      <p>Davies ‘echoed the gratitude’ to UKTV in a Twitter post earlier today (22 November).</p>
      <p>‘I will be hibernating until the next series in the hollow trunk of a mighty tree outside Channel 4,’ the comedian added.</p>
      <p>‘When I emerge I will be refreshed and angrier than ever with Alex.’</p>

      <p>UKTV, which owns Dave, will no doubt be disappointed to lose Taskmaster, which had become its highest-rated original series since debuting in 2015.</p>
