      <p>A Rathmore mum has issued a heartbreaking appeal for her family who has been left homeless after a devastating fire gutted their home just weeks before Christmas. Deirdre Carpenter (40) says her children are lucky to be alive after an uncontrollable blaze broke out at the home in Rathmore Village last Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Family friend Ellen Garry who was babysitting the children at the time managed to get Cormac (8), Cian (6) and Fionn (5) out before the fire ravaged the four-bed home but it was 8-year-old Cormac who has been branded a "superhero" after raising the alarm and saving the lives of his younger brothers.</p>
      <p>Nurse Deirdre has now made a desperate plea for help after the family were left with nothing but the 'clothes on their back.' A GoFundMe campaign that was set up to help the family rebuild their lives has already reached a staggering €16,000 in just three days. </p>

      </p>
      <p>She said:</p>
      <p>"The two younger boys, Kian and Fionn were asleep and Cormac was upstairs reading, he smelled smoke and came down to Ellen, they went to investigate and saw thick smoke coming out of the utility room. Ellen opened the door and saw the washing machine on fire."</p>
      <p>Brave little Cormac ran upstairs to wake up his two brothers and neighbour Ellen made a frantic dash to get the children out of the house. The fire service and ambulance crews were on the scene within minutes and neighbours immediately came to the assistance of the shocked family. But by that time the house was almost completely destroyed according to the mum of four.</p>
      <p>"It went up in minutes, by the time the fire brigade came out everything was gone. I couldn't believe the damage."</p>
      <p>Deirdre describes it as a 'miracle' that her eldest son Odhran (13) whose bedroom was directly above the utility room where the fire started, was not in the house that night. </p>
      <p>"Luckily he was at the cinema with his friends. If he had been home he would have been smothered with the smoke. The back of the house has collapsed since. When we saw his room we realised how lucky we were that he wasn't in it. He wouldn't have made it out alive. </p>

        <b>The Carpenter's home in Rathmore was completely devastated by the fire </b>
      </p>
      <p>Miss Carpenter commented that the family has 'lost everything' in the blaze.</p>
      <p>"Everything is gone. The boys have only the pyjamas they were wearing when they fled the house. Anything that wasn't burnt has been absolutely destroyed with the smoke and water damage. All of our family photos, sentimental things and memories I've kept since the boys were babies, they are all gone.</p>
      <p>"One of the younger boys had a teddy that he wouldn't sleep without since he was baby and my heart broke when he asked me 'is wolfy gone.' He is too young to understand. Their school uniforms, school bags, books, clothes, all their day to day things were all destroyed.</p>
      <p>"Odhran plays a lot of sport and is devastated that his hurleys, football boots and trophies he won over the years were all burnt. We literally have to start from scratch and rebuild our lives again. </p>
      <p>Heartbreakingly, Deirdre's mother passed away when she was a young child and the only thing she had left of her was also lost in the fire. </p>
      <p>"I don't have many memories of her. My dad gave me one of her fur coats that I never wore but I always cherished, it was all that I had left of her.  I broke down when I saw the charred remains of it in the wardrobe.</p>
      <p>Deirdre says the boys are struggling to come to terms with what has happened.</p>

        <b>Deirdre described the Rathmore house as the family home 'they always dreamed of'</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The boys are in shock. They were brought up to a neighbour's house straight away and the next morning they were asking me when they could go home. They thought it was just the utility room that was on fire, I had to tell them they wouldn't be going home and all of their belongings were gone. They were very upset.</p>
      <p>The Rathmore mum says her ex-husband and boys' father Keith Daly, were 'heartbroken' to see the 'dream house' they built just ten years ago ravaged in the inferno.</p>
      <p>"We were in absolute shock, completely crushed. I was so grateful that no one was injured but so much work and time went into planning the house. It was our ideal family home with the boys. It's a timber frame house and it's a possibility that it might have to be knocked if it's not safe. We just can't believe it. </p>
      <p>Deirdre who is originally from Cavan said he is 'overwhelmed' by the outpouring of support from the two communities who have rallied around her and the children since the fire.</p>

      <p>"I'm just absolutely blown away by the support we have received both here in Meath and in Cavan. I haven't lived in Cavan for 15 years but the amount of people who sent things to me from Virginia is unbelievable. I can't get over it. Even total strangers are sending me letters and helping us out.</p>
      <p>"We are staying with the boy's granny at the moment. She has been so good and has offered to give up her home and stay with her daughter until we find somewhere else to live.</p>
      <p>"The kids are still asking when are we going home, where are we going to live, where are we going to be for Christmas and I can't answer them. My youngest is worried that Santy won't know where we are this year. </p>
      <p>"While we are devastated, we are lucky and so thankful that everyone is alive and safe. It could have been so much worse. It doesn't bear thinking about.</p>
      <p>"I just want to make it all okay for the boys."</p>
