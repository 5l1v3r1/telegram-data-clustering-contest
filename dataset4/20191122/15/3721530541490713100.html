      <p>The 2019 fall TV season is in full swing, and that means <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/28/20936825/superman-show-lois-lane-cw-spinoff-tyler-hoechlin">The CW’s</a> yearly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/28/20936825/superman-show-lois-lane-cw-spinoff-tyler-hoechlin">Arrowverse shows</a> have made their return. But this fall is different than previous years; not only is <i>Arrow </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/5/14/18623769/cw-arrow-season-7-finale-recap-season-8">hanging up its bow after its 10-episode final season</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/7/18/20698871/cw-batwoman-review-sdcc-2019"><i>Batwoman </i>stepping up in its place</a>, but the yearly crossover is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/12/12/18137761/cw-elseworlds-crisis-on-infinite-earths-crossover-arrowverse">an adaptation</a> of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/10/13/13274364/dc-multiverse-parallel-worlds-explained">1985 maxiseries <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i></a>. Just like in the comics, the entire multiverse is in danger, affecting shows such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2016/9/13/12902132/superman-supergirl-season-2"><i>Supergirl</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/1/21/10811218/legends-of-tomorrow-explained"><i>Legends of Tomorrow</i></a><i> </i>and even <i>Black Lightning</i>.</p>
      <p>And the multiverse being in danger means that we can get cameos from many more DC Comics TV shows and movies than just the Arrowverse. The CW has yet to reveal any actual footage from the crossover, but what they <i>have </i>done is spent months announcing that this thing will be packed with guest stars. Some expected, others not, all of them pretty interesting.</p>
      <p>Here is every cameo (that we currently know of) to come in <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>.</p>

      <h3>Tom Welling &amp; Erica Durance as Superman and Lois Lane</h3>
      <p>For better or worse, everyone remembers the CW series <i>Smallville</i>. The then-modern Superman origin story with the cheesiest theme song will be a part of <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>, thanks to cameos from Tom Welling and Erica Durance. Welling played Clark Kent back in the day, and Durance joined the show in season as Lois Lane.</p>
      <p>Even though <i>Smallville</i> ended in 2011, neither actor has been too far away from DC shows. Welling was a recurring character during the third season of Fox’s <i>Lucifer</i>, and Durance has shown up on <i>Supergirl</i> as Kara’s mother, Alura Zor-El, since season two.</p>
      <p>Sadly, it seems that they’ll be the only members of the show to make an appearance in <i>Crisis</i>. Michael Rosenbaum, who played Lex Luthor on the show, <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelrosenbum/status/1176526751461019648?s=21">won’t be showing up at all</a>.</p>
      <h3>Brandon Routh as Superman</h3>
      <p>Before Henry Cavill was snapping necks and getting mustaches digitally erased, the last man to play Superman on the silver screen was Brandon Routh in the 2006 film <i>Superman Returns</i>. In the years since then, Routh has moved on to play Ray Palmer, aka the Atom, in the CW’s <i>Legends of Tomorrow</i>.</p>
      <p>And Routh will be pulling double duty for <i>Crisis</i>. Not only will he be showing up as the Atom, he’s also going to be playing the 2006 Superman from his movie. Routh’s Superman is also said to be drawing a lot of inspiration from the hit 1996 storyline <i>Kingdom Come, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/thecw_pr/status/1177629026925469696?s=21">right down to the costume</a>.</p>
      <p>Sadly, <i>Crisis </i>is going to be Routh’s last crossover for the foreseeable future. When <i>Legends of Tomorrow </i>returns in 2020, Routh and his wife Courtney Ford (who plays Nora Darhk on the show) will depart at some point during the season.</p>

      <h3>Tyler Hoechlin &amp; Bitsie Tulloch as Superman and Lois Lane</h3>
      <p>Yeah, there’s multiple Supermans and Lois Lanes (Loises Lane?) showing up during the crossover, and the Arrowverse’s Superman and Lois will be among them.</p>
      <p>Hoechlin has been playing Superman on <i>Supergirl </i>for limited appearances since season 2, while Tulloch only recently appeared with last year’s crossover, <i>Elseworlds</i>. That same crossover revealed that Lois and Clark had gotten engaged and that they were expecting a baby. Get used to seeing those two more often, because they’re <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/28/20936825/superman-show-lois-lane-cw-spinoff-tyler-hoechlin">getting their own show</a> in the near future.</p>
      <h3>John Wesley Shipp as … TBD</h3>
      <p>Shipp has been sticking with the speedsters for decades. He played the Flash in the superhero’s 1990s TV series, with the Arrowverse later snagging him in <i>The Flash </i>to play Barry’s dad Henry Allen. Years later, he got to suit up again as a speedster, playing the Flash of Earth-3, Jay Garrick. And, of course, he showed up briefly in last year’s <i>Elseworlds </i>as the Flash of Earth-90, only to get poofed away by the Monitor.</p>
      <p>You won’t be surprised to learn that Shipp is coming back for <i>Crisis, </i>though his role is very much under wraps. He could always come back as Jay for one last run, but there’s also the very real chance he shows up as his Earth-90 self again.</p>

      <h3>Kevin Conroy &amp; Burt Ward as Batman and Robin</h3>
      <p><i>Crisis’ </i>cameos won’t just be filled with former Superman actors, as Batman alums Kevin Conroy and Burt Ward will both make appearances during the event. Conroy, of course, has been voicing Batman in pretty much everything for decades, from <i>Batman: The Animated Series </i>to the <i>Arkham </i>games. He’ll be playing an older version of Bruce Wayne.</p>
      <p>Burt Ward is best known for playing Robin in the live action <i>Batman </i>series from the 1960s. Ward is expected to play a much older version of Dick Grayson, though it isn’t clear if their characters will be from the same universe. It’s not even clear what universe Conroy’s Wayne will be from, since the Earth-1 set <i>Batwoman </i>establishes that Batman mysteriously vanished years ago.</p>

      <h3>Ashley Scott as Helena Wayne</h3>
      <p>Before the CW entered the superhero game with <i>Smallville, </i>there was the short-lived <i>Birds of </i><i>Prey</i><i>, </i>set in Neo-Gotham. The series will get a shout out during <i>Crisis </i>with a cameo from its lead actor Ashley Scott, who played Batman and Catwoman’s daughter Helena Kyle, AKA the Huntress, on the show.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Scott isn’t the first cast member from <i>BoP </i>to transfer to the Arrowverse. That honor goes to <i>Batwoman’s </i>Rachel Skarsten, who plays the show’s lead villain, Alice. Before this, she was on <i>BoP </i>as Dinah, the Black Canary’s daughter with superpowers of her own. There’s no word yet on if Skarsten will return to that role for a cameo, but anything is possible.</p>
      <h3>Osric Chau as Ryan Choi</h3>
      <p><i>Crisis on Infinite Earths </i>won’t just spend time looking back, it’ll also be looking forward with at least two of its guest stars. Longtime CW watchers may remember Chau as the prophet Kevin Tran on <i>Supernatural. </i>Chau will be making his Arrowverse debut as Ryan Choi, aka the second Atom. Choi has been mentioned previously on <i>The Flash </i>and <i>Legends of Tomorrow, </i>and here he’s said to be have a key role in the coming Crisis.</p>
      <p>Ryan has been showing up a lot in extended media over the years; in addition to being in the recent run of <i>Justice League of America </i>comics, he’s popped up in animated features like <i>Young Justice </i>and various DC films, and was a DLC fighter in <i>Injustice 2</i>. He’s believed to be sticking around once the crossover ends, and with Routh leaving <i>Legends </i>soon after, the Waverider could use another genius on the ship.</p>
      <h3>Stephen Lobo</h3>
      <p>Longtime comics readers know that there’s one vital piece to <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths </i>that has yet to be brought up in the TV shows: The Spectre. He’s one of the only beings in the DCU who can physically fight the Anti-Monitor, and is the reason for the heroes coming together in the first place. In October, the CW announced announced that Stephen Lobo will be taking on the role of the spectral antihero.</p>
      <p>Lobo will first appear during the crossover as Spectre’s human identity, a cop named Jim Corrigan who eventually becomes bonded to the cosmic entity that makes up the Spirit of Vengeance. (Not the other one.)</p>
      <p>There’s still weeks before <i>Crisis </i>premieres, and it’s possible that The CW is keeping some of the guest stars under wraps as best they can. Maybe plans changed, and we’ll even see Lynda Carter show up after all.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s too much to expect any cast member from recent DC movies to make an appearance. Then again, if there’s one thing that the Arrowverse has taught us, it’s that nothing is truly out of the realm of possibility.</p>
      <p><i>Crisis on Infinite Earths </i>on The CW begins on Dec. 8.</p>
