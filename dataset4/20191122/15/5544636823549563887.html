      <p>Two of the English Premier League (EPL’s) top four teams clash on Saturday when Manchester City host <a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Chelsea</a>.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that Pep Guardiola’s men will be desperate to bounce back from their damaging <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/10/epl-liverpool-go-eight-points-clear-as-man-city-bemoan-var/">3-1 defeat away to Liverpool</a> before the international break, leaving them nine points behind Jurgen Klopp’s league leaders.</p>
      <p>As a result, Chelsea now sit one point ahead of City in third place and will have outside title aspirations of their own.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard has enjoyed an impressive start to his life as Chelsea manager and will expectedly give his counterpart a tough time.</p>
      <p>Who will triumph in this battle? Read on for <a href="http://www.concisenews.global/">our</a> preview, predictions, team news and TV coverage information.</p>

      <p>Man City have lost more Premier League games against Chelsea (25) than they have against any other side in the competition.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have won one and lost three of their last four Premier League away games against Man City, including their heaviest-ever defeat in the corresponding fixture last season.</p>
      <p>This is just the fifth time in the last nine seasons that Manchester City are facing Chelsea in a Premier League game while below The Blues in the table. The Citizens have not won any of the previous four in that time (two draws, two defeats).</p>
      <p>City have stopped Chelsea from scoring in five of the last six meetings in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Guardiola and Chelsea legend, Lampard – who played for City later in his career – will meet as managers for the first time in a competitive fixture.</p>
