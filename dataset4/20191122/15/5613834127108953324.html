      <p>Rob Zombie brings us the sad news today that another member of the<i> House of 1000 Corpses</i> family has left us. Veteran actor <b>Michael J. Pollard</b>, who starred alongside the late Sid Haig as Stucky in Zombie’s debut feature, has passed away at the age of 80.</p>
      <p>“I woke up to the news that Michael J. Pollard had died,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RobZombie/photos/a.385845778322/10157096581963323/?type=3&amp;theater">Zombie wrote on his Facebook page</a> this morning, sharing the above photograph. “I have always loved his work and his truly unique on screen presence. He was one of the first actors I knew I had to work with as soon as I got my first film off the ground. He will be missed.”</p>
      <p>Zombie added, “I can’t believe all three of my friends in this picture are now gone.”</p>
      <p>In 1968, Michael J. Pollard was nominated for “Best Supporting Actor” and “Most Promising Newcomer” at the Golden Globes for his performance in <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, a role that also landed Pollard an Oscar nomination for “Best Actor in a Supporting Role” that year.</p>
      <p>In the immediate wake of that breakout role, Pollard starred in films such as <i>The Smugglers</i>, <i>Hannibal Brooks</i> and <i>Dirty Little Billy</i>, and his career was taken into the 1980s with roles in <i>Melvin and Howard, Heated Vengeance, The American Way, Roxanne, American Gothic, Scrooged, Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland </i>and <i>Tango &amp; Cash</i>.</p>
      <p>Pollard also starred in<i> Dark Angel, Dick Tracy,</i> “Toxic Crusaders” and “Tales from the Crypt.”</p>
