      <p>Unfortunately it's not too inspiring a list, and we recommend that you go and take a look at the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39784/xbox-black-friday-sale-2019-xbox-one-and-windows-games-bundles-and-dlc">official Xbox Black Friday sale</a> for some deeper discounts, provided that you don't mind going digital. Still, Amazon isn't really the place to be shopping for games on Black Friday – it's a place to find decent deals on the other stuff you need to play your games. Here's some of the better deals in computing and television so far in the Amazon UK Black Friday sale.</p>
      <h4>4K TVs in the Amazon UK Black Friday Sale</h4>
      <p>There are some decent TVs included in the sale so far, including a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-BRAVIA-KD55XG70-55-inch-Ultra/dp/B07P7516P8">2019 Sony Bravia 55 Inch LED Smart TV with 4K HDR</a> – at £629 it's considerably cheaper than it has been in the past, as the TV shot back up to £800 a few months ago. If you're upgrading to the 4K life, you might also need a sound bar to go with it – TVs are so thin these days that the internal speakers are rarely up to scratch. Luckily Sony are also discounting the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-HT-RT4-Soundbar-System-Speakers/dp/B071HYWSKF">HT-RT4 600W 5.1 Soundbar System with Tall Rear Speakers</a>, bringing the set doen to £219.00 from its most recent price floor of £250. <b>Sony's TVs and soundbars are only in the sale today</b>. If you miss it, or you're less fussed about brand names on your sound equipment, there's a cheap and cheerful <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Soundbar-Bluetooth-Subwoofer-Equalizer-Connection/dp/B07VLBZY4D">Paiyda 35 inch bluetooth soundbar</a> in the longer-term sale for just £49.99.</p>
      <p>If you're not into Sony's whole thing, or you're just starting out in the world of 4K I'd humbly suggest the Philips 4K UHD range, more humbly costed but still packing decent visuals along with Smart TV functionality, an Ambilight backdrop and HDR 10+. The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-43PUS6754-12-TV-Ambilight/dp/B07RTGKWR6">43 inch</a> is only going to set you back £349.00 down from £400, with more savings at the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-43PUS6754-12-TV-Ambilight/dp/B07RS9JGWY">50 inch</a> tier, at £399.00 down from £550. The range is discounted all the way up to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-43PUS6754-12-TV-Ambilight/dp/B07R39Z81Y">the 65 Inch model</a>, though that's considerably less of a saving at £599.99 instead of £649.99.</p>
      <h4>Gaming Laptops and PCs in the Amazon UK Black Friday Sale</h4>
      <p>A lot of retailers are pushing the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-Pavilion-15-ec0000na-Dedicated-Graphics/dp/B07Z88MT74">HP Pavilion 15.6 range</a> of gaming laptops ahead of Black Friday, but Amazon has them beat to actually putting the machine on sale. However it's worth bearing in mind that most experts agree that it's unremarkable for all of it's affordability – gaming laptops are a difficult enough sell in the first place, so you might want to invest a little more. That one's down to £579 from £750.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere it seems there's a big push for ASUS' reliable gaming laptop range, with a beefier range of graphics cards under the hood. Also considered among the more "affordable" gaming laptops, which is of course relative to your budget, the ASUS TUF series has a generally positive reputation among professional reviews. The biggest saving on RRP is for the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-FX505DV-R7-3750H-GeForce-Windows/dp/B07SZ1DRSQ">ASUS TUF FX505DV</a>, which sports an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB graphics card with AMD's Quad-Core R7-3750H processor, 16GB of RAM and an on-board 512GB PCI-e SSD for storage. From personal experience beyond just these technical specs, ASUS definitely comes out on top just in terms of bloatware – unless things have changed in recent months, HP has a ridiculous amount of on-board self-branded nonsense that is difficult to safely untangle from the machine's daily operation.</p>
      <h4>Gaming and Computing Accessories in the Amazon UK Black Friday Sale</h4>
      <p>If you're downloading all of that 4K content, you might need some more SSD portable storage. Samsung's highly reliable T5 SSDs are on sale, in their <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MU-PA1T0B-Portable-SSD-1TB">1 terabyte</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MU-PA1T0B-Portable-SSD-1TB/dp/B074MCNDSK">2 terabyte</a> variants. Stick to the black colour, it's cheaper. Unless you're desperate for bright red. The 2TB is down to £243.99 from a previous floor of £292, while the 1TB is down to £113.49 from a previous Amazon UK record low of £148.</p>
      <p>It'd also be remiss of us not to point out that a very good Logitech 1080p HD Webcam with USB Connection is also discounted from £79.37 to £66.99 right now – we've used it for streaming setups in the office and at home, and we highly recommend it. Though the price has been creeping down over time, this is the lowest it has been on Amazon UK to date.</p>
