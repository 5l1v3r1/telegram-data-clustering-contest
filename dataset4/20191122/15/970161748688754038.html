      <p>Jennifer Garner lost her car in a one-story car park and spent over 25 minutes trying to find it.</p>
      <p>Yes, if you think you’re having a bad day then think again, as the 47-year-old had to get her friend to drive her around the other vehicles in search of her ride.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the actress shared a video of herself hunting down the car – and it’s too much.</p>
      <p>Upon entering the carpark, she told the camera that they were looking for the car in the section labeled Y.</p>

      <p>But despite walking for 10 whole minutes, they were unsuccessful.</p>

      <p>Pressing the button on her key fob, the 13 Going On 30 star sighed: ‘You know what’s happening? We’re out of batteries.’</p>
      <p>She laughed: ‘I stopped to tie my shoe, I should be on CSI: Miami.’</p>
      <p>The video then shoots to the pair driving around the carpark looking completely lost.</p>
      <p>‘Oh gosh,’ Jenner said: ‘This is where it gets complicated. Now I remember thinking about what to do.’</p>

      <p>Driving up to a junction she explained: ‘It won’t take us long just to go and do that loop, because I might have done that, or I might not have, I can’t tell you.’</p>
      <p>Getting frustrated, Jen added: ‘It’s been 25 minutes of looking for a car on a one-level parking lot.’</p>
      <p>However, shortly after a huge smile appeared on her face as she gushed: ‘I see it.’</p>
      <p>Howling down the lens, the mother-of-three said: ‘It’s nothing to do with that I said it was! I said it was that way in Y.’</p>
      <p>Her buddy sounded disappointed in the background and flipped the camera to a sign next to the car, which read ‘F’.</p>

      <p>‘It’s so rude to just move someone’s car to F,’ Jennifer jokes as they finally reach her car. Oh, Jen.</p>
