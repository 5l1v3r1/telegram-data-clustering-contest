      <h1>Damian McCrory vows to help Notts County overcome 'major blip'</h1>
      <h2>Magpies are looking for a response to heavy Barrow defeat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:14:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Damien McCrory is determined to help Notts County respond to a “major blip” as he targeted a much-improved performance against Aldershot tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Magpies suffered their first home defeat since August last weekend when they were beaten 3-0 by Barrow in a performance that boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Neal Ardley</a> admitted was below par.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> have the chance to return to winning ways against struggling Aldershot as they look to cut the gap to leaders Barrow at the summit.</p>
      <p>McCrory says the players were shown the video of last weekend’s defeat and they are more than aware of the problems they needed to address.</p>
      <p>“The gaffer showed us the video and it was clear that it just was not good enough,” revealed McCrory.</p>
      <p>“We were off it in both ways – with the ball and without it. It was a major blip and, as players, we’ve got to make sure it doesn’t happen again.</p>
      <p>“We know what we did wrong and what was missing from last Saturday’s performance, so we need to make sure that it is there this weekend.</p>
      <p>“A lot of lads were hurt so I think it will be a good learning process to make sure that it doesn’t happen again this season.</p>
      <p>“Other teams won’t let us play nice football all the time – some will get in our faces like Barrow and we’ve got to do the horrible stuff as well.</p>
      <p>“We have got to learn from last Saturday."</p>

      <p>Notts’ task tomorrow has been made increasingly difficult as Aldershot will be fired up after suffering a 6-1 hammering at the hands of Dagenham last week.</p>
      <p>Their manager Damon Searle pulled no punches in his criticism of their performance having blasted it as a disgrace and is eager for his players not to produce a repeat showing.</p>
      <p>Having been on the end of big defeats before in his career, McCrory says the mindset of the Shots will be to ensure they are tough to beat.</p>
      <p>But he says the main priority for Notts is to concentrate on their own game.</p>
      <p>“I think they will be working on not conceding,” said the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>“I‘ve been beaten 5-0 in my career and you go back to basics to make sure you are solid and hard to break down.</p>
      <p>“I can see that happening on Saturday, which is going to be another test for us.</p>
      <p>“I think we have got to play our own game and be solid ourselves while trying to score goals.”</p>
