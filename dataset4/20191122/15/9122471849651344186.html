      <h1>Alabama vs. Western Carolina: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:13:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quickly found itself back in the win column last weekend, but it came at a price. Tua Tagovailoa <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">went down with a season-ending hip injury</a> against Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>Losing a player as talented as Tagovailoa is certainly a tough blow for the Crimson Tide. However, the selection committee still has Alabama in the top five of the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>It’ll be on Alabama to show the committee it can still be a dominant team without its star quarterback. That means Mac Jones will have to be impressive in the team’s final two games.</p>
      <p>Jones will start this Saturday against Western Carolina, which should give him a nice chance to build up confidence before the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>Western Carolina is just 3-8 this season as is coming off a double-digit loss to Samford.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for the Alabama-Western Carolina game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>ESPN</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spread: </b>
        <a href="https://www.oddsshark.com/ncaaf/western-carolina-alabama-odds-november-23-2019-1117397">Alabama -57</a>
      </p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>61</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Roy Philpott, Kelly Stouffer</p>
      <p>Even without Tagovailoa this weekend, the Crimson Tide should take care of business against the Catamounts.</p>
      <p>Jones doesn’t have that much experience as the starting quarterback, but he’ll have plenty of weapons at his disposal. Jerry Jeudy, Devonta Smith and Henry Ruggs III should have plenty of chances to get loose against Western Carolina’s secondary.</p>
      <p>Do you think Alabama will look dominant in Week 13?</p>
