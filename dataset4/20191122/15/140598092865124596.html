      <h1>BBC staff in 'uproar' over new canteen rule 'limiting them to six chips each'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:59:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/j/jack-hardy/" target="_blank">Jack Hardy</a></address>
      <p>BBC staff are said to be in “uproar” after the corporation’s canteen instigated a “six chip” rule for cooked meals. </p>
      <p>Servers in the kitchens at Broadcasting House caused widespread bafflement after they were seen individually counting out chips as part of a new quota for employees. </p>
      <p>Rebellion quickly started brewing among the BBC's staff over the policy, some of whom took to social media to express their dismay.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of his pitiful serving on Twitter, Arif Ansari, head of news at the BBC Asian Network, wrote: “New rules in the BBC canteen limit the number of chips to six. </p>
      <p>“The staff seemed shocked that I didn’t go with the unlimited couscous instead.”</p>

      <p>Presenter Sheetal Parmar suggested they should “revolt” over the measures, while employees from the BBC’s Salford hub boasted of their canteen’s largesse. </p>
      <p>Dom Stirling, a freelance producer for BBC radio, disclosed details of the new regime to dispel any misconception that the “BBC was a glamorous place to work”. </p>
      <p>He wrote: “There is currently uproar in the canteen as the ‘6 chip rule’ is introduced. </p>
      <p>“In which servers are instructed to individually count out 6 chips per person.”</p>

      <p>Others were simply left confused by what they saw, with Charlotte Baker, a BBC researcher, saying she had “wondered why the server in the canteen appeared to be counting”. </p>
      <p>Mr Stirling responded: “I thought she was joking!”</p>
      <p>The BBC scrambled to deny the existence of a six chip rule when approached by <i>The Daily Telegraph.</i></p>
      <p>Despite being presented with accounts from several members of staff, a spokeswoman insisted: “It’s not true. As far as I’m concerned, it is not the rule.”</p>
      <p>Asked why staff would be discussing a crackdown on chip consumption if none existed, the spokeswoman said she was “not sure”, adding: “There is no six chip rule.”</p>
      <p>The BBC refused to comment on whether the policy was the result of a member of the canteen staff going rogue. </p>
      <p>Further steps to quell the crisis were then taken by the BBC’s press office, which shared a picture of a dish from the canteen containing an enviable 10 chips.</p>

      <p>It wrote on Twitter: “There’s something a little fishy about this as there is definitely no six-chip rule (see today’s lunch for evidence!)”</p>
