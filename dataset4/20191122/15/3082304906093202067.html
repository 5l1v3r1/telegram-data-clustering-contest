        <b>New Spurs boss Jose Mourinho was praised by Pep Guardiola after succeeding Mauricio Pochettino, who the Manchester City boss also admires.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola welcomed Jose Mourinho back to the Premier League by predicting the “incredible manager” will do a good job at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Mourinho and Guardiola clashed unforgettably while in charge of Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively at the start of the decade.</p>
      <p>Their renewed rivalry failed to catch fire in Manchester, however, as Guardiola stormed to back-to-back Premier League titles at City while Mourinho endured an increasingly torrid United tenure that culminated in his sacking 11 months ago.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino’s shock Spurs exit this week gave ex-Porto, Chelsea and Inter boss Mourinho an unexpected route back to the Premier League and it is one Guardiola expects him to grasp with both hands.</p>
      <p>“I think you know him better than me,” Guardiola told a news conference ahead of City’s game against Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“He was many years here in different clubs. Welcome back. He’s an incredible manager. I’m pretty sure he will do a good job.”</p>
      <p>Throughout his trophy-laden City tenure, Guardiola has certainly come far closer to meeting his match in Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs dealt the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss his first defeat in English football and Pochettino’s men also dramatically knocked City out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage last season.</p>
      <p>A failure to win silverware at Tottenham has been voiced as a criticism of Pochettino in some quarters, but Guardiola feels it is important to look at the Argentinian’s full body of work.</p>
      <p>“Mauricio has done an incredible job. All the managers are judged for the titles you win, but it’s not the truth,” he said.</p>
      <p>“At the end, it is the job you have done and in the time he was there I think the club was better.</p>
      <p>“Always the manager, when they leave, it is to know if the club or the team are better than the moment you took over these players or this club.</p>
      <p>“I think it happened. But decisions are made and there’s nothing else to say.”</p>

      <p>A fresher face in Premier League dugouts is in opposition to Guardiola this weekend and the City manager is an admirer of Frank Lampard, whose third-placed Chelsea team head into the weekend a point and a position above champions City.</p>
      <p>“From the beginning [of the season] his team played really good. He was consistent in his ideas and the results are there,” Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>“I am happy for him. I know him a little bit and have some info because was here. He’s an excellent person.</p>
      <p>“I think it is good for English football. It’s so nice that young English managers are taking over the important clubs and doing well.</p>
      <p>“Playing the way they play is perfect for English football. It is the best way to get better for the national team and the club itself.”</p>
