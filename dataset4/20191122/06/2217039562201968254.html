        <b>As thick smoke billowed out of the windows of the second-storey shophouse unit, two men emerged onto a sloping roof below.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trapped for several minutes, the men, who were shirtless, were finally able to get down when fellow workers propped up a ladder.</p>
      <p>In dramatic scenes at 85 Sims Avenue yesterday, Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighters went into the building's smoke-filled narrow passages.</p>
      <p>They rescued one man from a bedroom on the second storey and he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for smoke inhalation. Four others had already evacuated.</p>
      <p>In a statement yesterday, an SCDF spokesman said they responded to a fire at the unit at about 7.20pm.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival, they saw thick black smoke coming from both floors of the shophouse.</p>
      <p>"The fire, which involved contents of a bedroom on the ground floor, was extinguished with one water jet," said the spokesman.</p>
      <p>Photos posted on SCDF's Facebook page showed firefighters at the scene against a backdrop of piles of durians.</p>
      <p>One photo, believed to be of the bedroom on the ground floor, showed a gutted room with blackened walls and bed frames.</p>
      <p>Dozens of passers-by had gathered nearby to watch the firefighters at work.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said they saw a lot of smoke, but did not catch sight of any flames.</p>
      <p>A worker from Sam Fruit Trading, which has a stall on the first storey of the building, said he was in the living quarters on the second storey with his colleagues when thick black smoke engulfed them.</p>
      <p>The man, who did not want to be identified, said there were strange sounds just before he smelt smoke.</p>
      <p>"I heard two loud popping sounds, then suddenly there was smoke, which gradually became a lot and filled the bedrooms," he said.</p>
      <p>He added that he was able to escape with the help of his colleagues.</p>
      <p>Investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing.</p>
