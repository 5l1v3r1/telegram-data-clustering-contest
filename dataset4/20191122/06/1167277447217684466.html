      <p>Based on the plot of the book ‘The Last Soldiers of the Cold War,’ by Brazilian Fernando Morais, the feature film tells the story of Cuban anti-terrorists (Gerardo Hernandez, Rene Gonzalez, Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez and Ramon Labañino), who infiltrated anti-Cuban groups in the United States to prevent attacks on their nation during the 1990s.</p>
      <p>The co-production between France, Spain, Belgium and Brazil was screened at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and stars Spanish actress Penelope Cruz and Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal.</p>
      <p>The film has been well received at important film festivals such as the Toronto International Film Festival, the San Sebastian Film Festival, and the New York Film Festival.</p>
      <p>From December 5 to 15, the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema will also include in its Galas Section the films ‘Emma,’ by Pablo Larrain (Chile); ‘Parasitos,’ by Bong Joon-Ho (South Korea); Chicuarotes, by Gael Garcia Bernal (Mexico); ‘Marighella,’ by Wagnar Moura (Brazil); and the documentary ‘Diego Maradona,’ by Asif Kapadia (United Kingdom). <i>(Taken from Prensa Latina)</i></p>
