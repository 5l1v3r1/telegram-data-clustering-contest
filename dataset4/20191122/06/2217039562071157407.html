        <b>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) captain charged over his role in the incident that led to the death of full-time national serviceman Liu Kai will be contesting the matter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Regular serviceman Ong Lin Jie, 28, was in court yesterday with his lawyer, who said that the officer will be claiming trial.</p>
      <p>A pre-trial conference is slated for Dec 23. Ong was charged last month with committing a rash act causing death.</p>
      <p>He had allegedly failed to keep a safety distance of 30m between the Land Rover that he and Corporal First Class (CFC) Liu were in and a Bionix infantry fighting vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Bionix reversed and mounted the driver's side of the Land Rover during a training exercise at Murai Urban Training Facility on Nov 3 last year.</p>
      <p>CFC Liu, a 22-year-old transport operator from SAF's Transport Hub West, was then driving Ong, who is from the Active Unit Training Centre.</p>
      <p>The captain was there to evaluate the exercise troops. The 42nd Battalion Singapore Armoured Regiment was conducting a two-sided company mission exercise that day.</p>
      <p>CFC Liu died after the Bionix, despite repeated commands by its rear guide to stop, mounted the Land Rover.</p>
      <p>If convicted, Ong could be jailed for up to five years or fined, or both. <b>- LIM MIN ZHANG</b></p>
