      <p>On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) wondered whether Democrats will have enough votes to impeach the president after the public impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>McCarthy said, “I wonder if the Democrats will even have the votes to move impeachment now.”</p>
      <p>He later added, “I will tell you today, after watching these two weeks of hearings, I don’t know if it’s even going to get to the Senate.”</p>
