      <p>Scott Fardy refuses to put a number on when he'll call time on his world-traversing career.</p>
      <p>Fardy was 35 last July but remains a key figure for Leinster in their bid to win the Champions Cup for a fifth time, a campaign that continues in Lyon on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But he was happy to only agree a one-year contract encompassing this season.</p>
      <p>“I'm pretty old," the versatile forward explained with a smile.</p>
      <p>“It was mutual, my decision as well. I just take it as it comes. </p>
      <p>"I'm really enjoying it here and having a lot of fun, and I'm learning a lot every day. </p>
      <p>"I don't know whose decision it was to make it one in the end, I think I just said, 'let's just do one and take it as it comes'. </p>
      <p>"When you come to my age you don't want to let anyone down. I just want to keep playing and see how I'm progressing in the early parts of the season and into the New Year. </p>
      <p>"I didn't want to be in a situation where you're struggling physically and you still have another year to go. </p>
      <p>"It wasn't about the finance of the thing, it was more about where my head would be at some stage in the future."</p>
      <p>Fardy still feels fresh for a guy in his mid-Thirties who has played Test rugby with Australia.</p>
      <p>He points to the fact that he spent three years in club rugby in Japan before his career really took off back home with the Brumbies.</p>
      <p>"I feel well," he said.</p>

      <p>"There's no number...I think if you put a number in your head, that's where you'll go to.  "I'm not desiring to play forever, I know there's an end date on when you play. </p>
      <p>"Every guy is different. I had a period at the start of my career when I was in Japan when I wasn't getting bashed around. You look at a guy making Test debuts at 21 or 22, I didn't do that. </p>
      <p>"I didn't debut in Test rugby until I was 29. In terms of life in my legs, I'm feeling pretty good compared to what other guys might be going through.</p>
      <p>"But you look at Thorny (Brad Thorn) who played from when he was 19 (until 38). Every guy is different. I feel pretty good at the moment."</p>
      <p>Despite plying his trade on three continents, Fardy dismisses the suggestion that he's a wandering spirit.</p>
      <p>"I'm actually a bit of a crab - a Cancer - so I actually like to stay at home a lot, that's what my wife says," he remarked.</p>
      <p>"I like home life, my family is very comfortable here in Dublin, we enjoy the set-up here at the moment. </p>
      <p>"Life has changed a lot coming here. We really enjoy it. I have no real interest in going around the world too much."</p>
      <p>His wife, Penelope, is a singer and he's not sure if the family will remain in Ireland in the long term.</p>
      <p>"We're not sure, it's always a tough thing," he said.</p>
      <p>"Australia is always there for us, in terms of going back and living there. </p>
      <p>"We enjoy here, we're really comfortable here. My son has only been to Australia for a couple of weeks of his life so he doesn't know anything else. </p>
      <p>"I feel part of the community, playing here, they're all good guys here."  </p>

      <p>Leinster boss Leo Cullen will look at the possibility of bringing in a big foreign name or two in the months to come.</p>
      <p>Scott Fardy and Joe Tomane will be the only foreign players on the Blues books this time next year, as Jamison Gibson-Park is now Irish qualified - and James Lowe will be in the autumn of 2020.</p>
      <p>"It's still important to get some of that outside influence," said Cullen. </p>
      <p>"Predominantly we want to bringing mostly our own guys. That's the model but every now and again we look at players and think he can add something to this group. </p>
      <p>"It's always worth having the conversation at least".</p>
