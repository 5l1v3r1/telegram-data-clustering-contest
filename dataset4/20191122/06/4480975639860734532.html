      <h1>GBP Futures: scope for a correction lower</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:38:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/pablo-piovano" target="_blank">Pablo Piovano</a></address>
      <p>Open interest and volume in GBP futures markets increased on Thursday by around 2.4K contracts and 11.5K contracts, respectively, as per advanced readings from CME Group.</p>
      <h3>GBP/USD risks a test of 1.2770</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd"><b>Cable</b></a>â€™s drop on Thursday was on the back of rising open interest and volume, a sign that fresh sellers are entering the markets. That said, the door is now open for a deeper retracement with the next relevant target at monthly low near 1.2770.</p>
