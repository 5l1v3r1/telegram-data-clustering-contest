      <p>Manchester United have recently seemed confident that they will be able to land Leicester City star and recent England debutant James Maddison in January.</p>
      <p>However, according to The Sun, Maddison may dash their hopes by signing a new contract at Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Maddison has been in fantastic form this season, already scoring decisive winners against both Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will apparently suffer another blow in the January window as RB Leipzig are reportedly going to rival them in a bid to sign Erling Haaland.</p>
      <p>The young Norwegian is one of the hottest strikers in the world right now and Manchester United have repeatedly been linked with a move for him.</p>
