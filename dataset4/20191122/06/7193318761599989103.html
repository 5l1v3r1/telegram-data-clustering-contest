      <p>NORMAN — Grant Calcaterra is stepping away from football.</p>
      <p>More than a month after playing his last game with Oklahoma, Calcaterra announced on Twitter on Thursday night that concussions had ended his career.</p>
      <p>“Dear Sooner Nation, my friends and family and everybody who’s had an impact on my career and my life: Over a month ago, I a received a concussion in practice,” Calcaterra said in a video posted on his Twitter account. “What most of you may not know is that I’ve had my fair share of concussions in my career. I’ve spent countless hours visiting with OU medical professionals and specialists around the country. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that it’s best for me to step away from the game. This has been the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make in my life but I haven’t been alone.”</p>
      <p>Calcaterra said he plans to return home to Southern California and pursue a career as a firefighter after he graduates in May.</p>
      <p>Calcaterra finishes his OU career with 637 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. This season, he had five catches for 79 yards.</p>
      <p>He hadn’t played since Oct. 5 at Kansas when he had a single 19-yard reception.</p>
      <p>The junior from Rancho Santa Margarita, California will perhaps best be remembered as a Sooner for his one-handed touchdown grab in last year’s Big 12 Championship Game against Texas that sealed the win and sent OU to the College Football Playoff.</p>

          <i>Report: Tillman in transfer portal</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Redshirt freshman fullback Coby Tillman, a former Bixby High standout, has entered the NCAA Transfer Portal, according to The Athletic.</p>
      <p>Tillman is a walk-on who has appeared in one game this season.</p>
      <p>Cornerback Starrland Baldwin, defensive back Miguel Edwards and outside linebacker Jonathan Perkins entered the portal earlier this season.</p>

          <i>Kelly, Jackson not expected to go through Senior Day festivities</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Linebackers Caleb Kelly and Mark Jackson Jr. have played a lot of games for Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>They just haven’t played much this season.</p>
      <p>Kelly has yet to make his season debut due to a knee injury he suffered during the spring, though he’s dressed for the last two games.</p>
      <p>Jackson has seen action in three games — including last week’s win over Baylor — after battling back, Lincoln Riley said, from being in the “doghouse” early in the season.</p>
      <p>Riley said Wednesday that neither were expected to participate in Saturday’s Senior Day activities and that Kelly definitely wouldn’t.</p>
      <p>Kelly has played in 37 games with 24 career starts. He has 153 tackles, an interception and two defensive touchdowns</p>
      <p>Jackson has played in 34 games with seven starts. He has 53 career tackles and four sacks.</p>
      <p>Both could redshirt. Kelly redshirting at this point was expected, as he could only surpass the four-game cap by playing every game the rest of the way with the Sooners making the national title game.</p>
      <p>Jackson has just one game remaining to be eligible for a redshirt.</p>
