      <p>North Gallery &amp; Studio at the Shoppes at Northpark is growing, with original work from a new group of Oklahoma artists to be exhibited in the space next door.</p>
      <p>In July, artists Patricia Triplett and Janetta Smith opened North Gallery &amp; Studio as a space to create and sell their work and that of others, such as Oklahoma City artist Bert Seabourn. They also offer workshops and classes to help artists pursue their own craft.</p>
      <p>This month, The Studios at North Gallery &amp; Studio will debut with galleries for paintings, sculptures and Native American pottery and basketry as well as a working art studio.</p>
      <p>“We realized how hard it was for individual artists to have all the resources necessary to create a successful art business. We wanted to use our position as an established gallery to help our local artists,” Smith said of the studio and gallery space.</p>

        <b>Legislators represent Oklahoma in Taiwan</b>
      </p>
      <p>State Sen. Roland Pederson, Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell and other regional legislative leaders recently comprised the Southern United States Legislature Leaders Delegation, discussing opportunities for trade and investment in both Oklahoma and the southern U.S. with Taiwanese officials.</p>
      <p>Pederson was selected as a delegate for the trip due to his expertise in Oklahoma’s agricultural economy, Pinnell said.</p>
      <p>“It was an honor to lead a delegation of legislative leaders from Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas to Taiwan last week,” Pinnell said. “It was a great opportunity to strengthen the bonds between our states and Taiwan. On the trip, we emphasized the opportunities for trade between Oklahoma and Taiwan, particularly with Oklahoma wheat and beef.”</p>
