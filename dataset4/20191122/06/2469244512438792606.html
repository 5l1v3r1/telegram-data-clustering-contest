      <h2>A 'severe difficulty' in recruiting qualified mental health nurses has led to more mental health bed closures</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>A Devon hospital is believed to be losing a further eight mental health beds bringing the total loss this year to 16 due to staff shortages.</p>
      <p>In May, Devon Partnership trust (DPT) confirmed beds at North Devon District Hospital were being closed, but would not state how many and confirmed there were no plans to close either of its mental health wards - Ocean View and neighbouring Moorland View.</p>
      <p>Reassurances were made it was a 'short term issue'. However, the following month it confirmed the loss of eight beds and said it had 'temporarily' merged two wards to create one 24-bed ward.</p>
      <p>Further reassurances were made it planned to reopen the other ward following a recruitment drive.</p>
      <p>This week it has been revealed the remaining ward - Moorland View – is losing more beds due to continuing recruitment problems.</p>
      <p>An NHS employee, who asked not to be named in fear of losing their job for being a whistleblower, said eight more beds are being lost at the unit and those that remain will be prioritised for local people.</p>
      <p>The news comes after some ‘serious concerns’ were raised by independent health and social care regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) after inspected four of DPT’s key adult mental health services.</p>
      <p>It noted between March 2018 and February 2019, 379 patients had been treated in out of area beds due to a lack of beds, an increase since the last inspection.</p>
      <p>Inspectors also highlighted some high-risk and urgent patients waited up to a year instead of a week for treatment, others waiting up to three years and the numbers on waiting lists.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower said: “A further eight beds are closing making a total of 16 closed. It is leaving us with just 16 beds left.</p>
      <p>“There is a staff shortage, but also staff have left because of the working conditions. We have had numerous staff assaults, constant verbal abuse, staff regularly going without any breaks on a long day shift, and poor management.</p>
      <p>“It’s disgraceful. They are going to use the remaining 16 beds solely for north Devon patients.</p>
      <p>“That’s a good thing as we normally have patients from all over the county. There will be a better use of beds and community services will have to support us more and keep patients home treated as much as possible.”</p>
      <p>DPT runs adult mental health provisions in the county. Following its latest CQC inspection, the results of which were published last month, one of its four core services were rated outstanding, one as good, one as requires improvement and one inadequate.</p>
      <p>The overall rating given was 'good'.</p>

      <p>Among the questions DPT was asked by Devon Live was what impact the bed closures will have on mental health patients who are already suffering a shortage of mental health beds in Devon, how many more staff need to be recruited to reopen the eight beds and its other lost beds, and what is being done to recruit new staff and retain current employees?</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Devon Partnership NHS Trust said: “We have had to temporarily suspend some of our inpatient beds in north Devon because of severe difficulty in recruiting qualified mental health nurses. The situation is under continuous review and we will start to re-open beds as soon as it improves.”</p>
