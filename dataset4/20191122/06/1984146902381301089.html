      <h2>Magdalena Lehmann was already facing a speeding offence for driving at more than double the limit when she was stopped for being drunk behind the wheel</h2>

      <p>A drink driver "couldn't stop laughing" when she was stopped by police for swerving all over a main road.</p>
      <p>Magdalena Lehmann was more than double the legal limit when she was spotted by officers going across the centre white line, on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/coast-road">Coast Road</a>, in Newcastle, and then braking so hard for a speed camera that her vehicle nearly left the carriageway.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old was pulled over by police but, rather than show remorse, she found the "whole situation funny and couldn't stop laughing", <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">a court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>However, the smile soon disappeared when she was arrested for failing a roadside breath test and later gave a reading of 81 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath, with the legal limit being 35 microgrammes.</p>
      <p>It also emerged that, at the time, Lehmann, of Station Road, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend,</a> was also facing a speeding offence where she was caught doing 69mph on a 30mph stretch of the Coast Road.</p>
      <p>She appeared at South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court on Thursday and pleaded guilty to one count of driving with excess alcohol and one of speeding.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Lehmann was caught driving her Audi A4 at 69mph on a 30mph zone on the Coast Road on December 28 2018.</p>
      <p>Whilst still facing that offence on September 20 this year, she was spotted by police driving on the Central Motorway, in Newcastle, at around 1.30am.</p>
      <p>James Long, prosecuting, said officers first noticed her when she overtook them at speed "in excess of the limit" before turning on to the Coast Road.</p>
      <p>Mr Long added: "The vehicle was seen to be swerving all over the road and breaking the centre white line.</p>
      <p>"It nearly went off the road to the nearside after braking so hard for a speed camera.</p>
      <p>"As a result, the vehicle is stopped near Newton Road.</p>
      <p>"Police speak with the driver, this defendant, and she smells of alcohol and appears drunk and unsteady on her feet.</p>
      <p>"The defendant, however, found the whole situation funny and couldn't stop laughing."</p>
      <p>Stuart Jamieson, defending, told the court that Lehmann had been the victim of an horrific domestic assault a number of years ago and, as a result, became a helper in an organisation, which supports similar victims.</p>
      <p>He said one of those victims had rang her on the night she was caught speeding and asked her to come to her house in an "emergency situation".</p>
      <p>However, speaking about the drink driving, Mr Jamieson told magistrates that Lehmann had found out that her attacker was going to be released from prison.</p>
      <p>He said: "This was horrendous news for her and she's gone to see a friend, where she's had a couple of glasses of wine.</p>
      <p>"She makes an error judgement and attempts to drive back to Wallsend."</p>
      <p>Lehmann, who owns her own business, was fined Â£300 and banned from driving for 19 months.</p>
