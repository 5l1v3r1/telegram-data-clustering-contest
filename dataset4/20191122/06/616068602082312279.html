      <p>A pioneering study of seven belugas in Canada's remote Arctic waters has found microplastics in the innards of every single whale.</p>
      <p>Researchers from Ocean Wise worked with hunters from the Inuvialuit community of Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., to collect samples from whales they harvested between 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>They found an average of nearly 10 microplastics, or particles less than five millimetres in size, in the gastrointestinal tracts of each beluga.</p>
      <p>The study was published last week in the Marine Pollution Bulletin and conducted in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Simon Fraser University.</p>
      <p>Ocean Wise says it is the first study of microplastics in a marine mammal in Canada.</p>
      <p>Lead author Rhiannon Moore says she wasn't expecting to see so many microplastics so far north.</p>
      <p>"It actually surprised me at first. I thought, this is a far-north top predator in the Arctic in a fairly remote place," Moore says in an interview.</p>
      <p>It demonstrated just how far microplastics can travel and how they've penetrated even the most remote environments, she says.</p>
      <p>"It definitely tells us they're ubiquitous, they're ending up everywhere," she says. "It's a global problem, it's not a contained local problem, so it's going to take a lot of different actors — government, industries and consumers — to try to limit the flow."</p>
      <p>Nine different types of plastic polymers were identified in the animals, with polyester being the most common.</p>
