      </p>
      <h3>Country Music By Ken Burns<br/>9.30pm, BBC Four</h3>
      <p>Coinciding with the country music awards (highlights of which will be shown at 11.10pm), this nine-part series on the history of the genre begins with a double bill of episodes. Using beautiful archive clips and interviews with luminaries such as Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris, it documents how country out started as “hillbilly music” before reaching prominence with the Carter Family’s recordings in the 1930s. A toe-tapping anthropological history, told with Burns’s trademark informative light touch. <i>Ammar Kalia</i></p>
      <h3>Junior Bake Off<br/>5pm, Channel 4</h3>

      <p>It has been a challenging series for the mini bakers, with madeleines flying around, sushi biscuits and even a cheeseboard. But now it is the final, with lovable host and cheerleader Harry Hill setting the kids a double challenge to make both iced buns and inside-out biscuits. <i>Hannah Verdier</i></p>
      <h3>Unreported World<br/>7.30pm, Channel 4</h3>
      <p>Reporter Sahar Zand and director Katie Arnold travel to Iraq to meet its new social media stars, millennials who are putting themselves at risk in gathering millions of followers by celebrating beauty and fashion amid the country’s anti-wealth protests. A refreshing look at influencer culture. <i>AK</i></p>
      <h3>Mountain Vets<br/>8pm, BBC Two</h3>
      <p>The picturesque series that follows vets in craggy Mourne in Northern Ireland continues. Spring has sprung, so there are dozens of lambs arriving, including some by urgent caesarian section. But parenthood isn’t for everyone: nine male calves are about to meet Miriam’s castrating iron. <i>Graeme Virtue</i></p>
      <h3>The Name of the Rose<br/>9pm, BBC Two</h3>
      <p>Salvatore has kidnapped the Occitan girl; she will come in handy for his love potion, that, naturally, also involves a black cat. Meanwhile, there is talk of a strange book in Greek; Remigio is arrested and given the ultimate hot water bottle; and there is a climactic struggle at a waterfall for William and Anna. <i>Ali Catterall</i></p>
      <h3>Cool Daddio: The Second Youth of R Stevie Moore<br/>9pm, Sky Arts</h3>
      <p>With more than 400 albums to his name since his first bedroom sessions in the early 1960s, R Stevie Moore has become regarded as the godfather of home recordings. The famously reclusive Moore now goes on camera to talk through his underground career and recent resurgence. <i>AK</i></p>
