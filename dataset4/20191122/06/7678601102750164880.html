      <h1>Ma'ruf backs police's lavish lifestyle ban, advising officials to also display 'modesty'</h1>

      <p>Vice President Ma’ruf Amin has backed the National Police’s instruction for officers to refrain from exhibiting a luxurious lifestyle, even advising other state officials to take note of the instruction and display “modesty” in daily life.</p>
      <p>The National Police headquarters recently issued a circular on its ethics code, ordering officers not to “show, use or display luxury items” both in the office and in public, citing reasons that it could lead to “jealousy and envy toward the police institution”.</p>
      <p>The circular, which also instructed officers to avoid uploading pictures or videos that showcase a lavish lifestyle on social media, was signed by the National Police’s Internal Affairs Division chief Insp. Gen. Listyo Sigit Prabowo on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>Ma’ruf said such instruction could also be applied by other state institutions as he believed that it could create positive effects in encouraging civil servants not to showcase a lavish lifestyle.</p>
      <p>“I think [the instruction] is good since it helps to prevent stirring public resentment or dissatisfaction,” Ma’ruf said as quoted by <i>kompas.com, </i>“It will be very nice if other institutions can follow suit, it’s about [promoting] modesty.”</p>
      <p>The police’s circular mentioned that a strict punishment awaited personnel who violated the regulation, however, it did not specify the punishment or what were considered luxurious items.</p>
      <p>Police officers had in the past come under the spotlight for sporting luxury items while on duty.</p>
      <p>For instance, some personnel who exchanged fire with terrorists in front of Sarinah in Central Jakarta back in 2016 were seen wearing luxury items, including Coach bags and limited edition Adidas and Gucci sneakers. Their picture went viral on social media, raising some eyebrows. <b>(dpk)</b></p>
