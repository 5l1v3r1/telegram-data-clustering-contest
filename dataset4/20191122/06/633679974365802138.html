      <p>Fans of the longtime running soapie horrified at the news just weeks ago that the entire cast had been released from their contracts can rest easy again as the series nears a deal for the renewal of a 56<sup>th</sup> season.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/days-of-our-lives-renewed-season-56-nbc-1203412297/">Variety</a> an unnamed source said that the deal for the renewal is not one hundred per cent done yet, but to all intents and purposes it seems like the daily soap opera will go back into production in January next year.</p>
      <p>Watching Kristina Alfonsaâ€™s (Hope Williams Brady in the soapie) post on Instagram, it looks like fans and the media should not have jumped to any conclusions.</p>
