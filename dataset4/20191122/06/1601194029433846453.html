      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/zhang-weili">Weili Zhang</a> is now the queen of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> Strawweight division. Her next opponent, as confirmed by Dana White, will be the former champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/joanna-jedrzejczyk">Joanna Jedrzejczyk</a> and it's certainly going to be an interesting fight.</p>
      <p>Jedrzejczyk reportedly refused a fight with Zhang before, but now that she's back in the W column following a win over Michelle Waterson, she seems to have her confidence back and she's ready to face the Chinese sensation.</p>
      <p>Weili Zhang was interviewed by <b><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-zhang-weili-explains-why-finish-joanna-jedrzejczyk-early">MMA Junkie</a></b><b> </b>about her upcoming fight with Jedrzejczyk and said that her emotions could be her undoing. The Polish superstar is known to be fired-up and emotional quite often, but according to the champion, that could be detrimental to her.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think she sounds very angry all the time, and her emotions will get her in trouble.”</blockquote>
      <p>Zhang further affirmed that Jedrzejczyk refused to fight her at one point and said that she's game to fight her as soon as next week!</p>
      <blockquote>“She is willing to fight me now, but there was a time she didn’t want to fight me, as well. I am ready anytime for battle. Just call my manager Mr. Brian (Butler) and the boss Dana, and we can fight next week.”</blockquote>
      <p>When asked about how the fight will play out, the Chinese superstar predicted that it would end within a round or two, making it sound like she would be doing her a favor by ending it quickly to prevent any long-term damage for her opponent:</p>
      <blockquote>“I am always looking to finish a fight as soon as I can so my opponent doesn’t have to endure long periods of damage. I see the fight ending in one or two rounds. I think Joanna possesses great skill with her striking, along with good power, but I believe in my training and team to have me ready to beat her anywhere.”</blockquote>
      <p>This is undoubtedly the most exciting Strawweight fight in a long time and hopefully, we get to see it in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Jedrzejczyk had issues with her foot against Waterson but doesn't seem to be looking for a long layoff. Zhang, on the other hand, is game to fight anytime so expect the official announcement within the next month or so.</p>
