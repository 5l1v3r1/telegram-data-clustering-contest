        <b>From time to time every person feels the need to have a talk with a broadminded and intelligent conversational partner, having in mind themselves, of course. That was possibly one of the motives behind US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' idea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>US Democratic senator and presidential candidate in the 2020 US elections, Bernie Sanders, appeared in a video interview titled “Bernie vs. Bernie” with his well-known comedian impersonator James Adomian.</p>
      <blockquote>"What I said to myself, was, 'we don't get a fair shot in the mainstream media, so I said, what the heck, what the hay, I would interview myself'. So here we are", said the impersonator at the beginning of the interview.</blockquote>

      <p>The 8-minute interview, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910211077102986-gabbard-hillary-clinton-russian-asset-2016-sanders-endorsement/">filmed before Wednesday's Democratic debate</a> in Atlanta and posted to YouTube on Thursday by Adomian, showed the two versions of Sanders dressed the same way and seated next to each other while humorously discussing a variety of topics related to the presidential hopeful’s electoral campaign, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201910181077079946-our-world-not-just-america-needs-bernie-sanders/">including the real Sanders' guarantees</a> of free education, health care, and jobs.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Adomian imitated the voice and gestures of Senator Sanders.</p>
      <blockquote>“Your shoes are polished. You are trying to look like me", said Sanders, accusing his doppelganger of not following his “rumpled” fashion style.</blockquote>
      <p>“I agree with you on this. I don’t <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910171077063918-three-of-four-members-of-the-squad-set-to-endorse-bernie-sanders-for-president/">agree with myself</a> on everything", Adomian responded.</p>
      <p>The comedian, who became famous during the 2016 presidential elections while impersonating Sanders, later on Thursday tweeted a fragment of the video, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910181077077758-new-poll-shows-sanders-beats-trump-in-iowa-while-biden-warren-lose/">tagging the Senator</a>. Sanders retweeted the video with the comment: “It was an honour to talk to myself”.</p>
