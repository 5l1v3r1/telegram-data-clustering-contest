      <p>SHAWNEE — A stream of witnesses, including the mother and daughter of convicted cop killer Byron Shepard, pleaded with a jury Thursday to spare his life.</p>
      <p>Pamela Dotson, Shepard's mother, sobbed as she described a life of domestic violence and drug abuse witnessed by Shepard growing up.</p>
      <p>"I was getting beat all the time and using drugs all the time," Dotson, 59, told jurors who will decide his punishment Friday. "When I was doing drugs I didn't care how he felt about me."</p>
      <p>Dotson apologized to her son for not being a better mother. Shepard, who showed little emotion during the trial, wiped away tears.</p>
      <p>"I'm so sorry," she said. "I could have raised him a lot differently. It's all I know."</p>
      <p>The woman denied accusations she blamed her son for a suicide attempt and taught him how to cook methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>She told jurors her son "didn't deserve" the death penalty as punishment for his crime.</p>
      <p>"He knows he's done wrong, I know he's done wrong," she said. "I can save him."</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty as punishment for Shepard, 38, of Okemah. He was convicted Monday of killing Tecumseh police officer Justin Terney, 22, on March 26, 2017, following a traffic stop and foot chase.</p>
      <p>They allege Shepard poses a "continuing threat to society."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, a convicted felon and two former love interests testified for the prosecution about physical abuse they suffered at the hands of Shepard.</p>
      <p>Also Thursday, Shepard's 18-year-old daughter took the witnesses stand. Breanna Shepard cried, telling jurors how much she liked to go over to his house on weekends after her parents divorced.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen his bad side," she said. "I've heard stories."</p>
      <p>Breanna testified about being a high school senior who is planning to study physical therapy at the University of Oklahoma in the fall.</p>
      <p>She said she would visit her father in prison because "I can't stand not seeing him."</p>
      <p>She answered "no" when asked if she wanted him to receive the death penalty.</p>
