      <h3>Jamie Whincup and the Red Bull Holden Racing Team have combined to land the first blow on the streets of Newcastle, with the seven-time champion ousting Cameron Waters and teammate Shane van Gisbergen in a hotly-contested Practice 2.</h3>
      <p>Whincup launched to P1 at the death in the 30-minute session to set a session-best 1:10.3173s – but Waters’ #5 Monster Energy Mustang was just 0.0057s down the road, with van Gisbergen a further 0.0549s down.</p>
      <p>The top eight were separated by a scant 0.1301s, with Practice 1 fast man Scott McLaughlin fourth in the session, just 0.0666s down on Whincup’s benchmark.</p>

      <p>McLaughlin has already sealed the drivers’ title, but just 116 points separate Shell V-Power Racing and the Red Bull Holden squad in the battle for pit lane priority, with 576 points on offer this weekend in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Both factory Holdens need to be up the front to keep their hopes alive, and they did so on Friday. However, Whincup admitted there’s more in his car, but was happy to set the fastest time on his final lap.</p>
      <p>“My car didn’t feel that flash then on good tyres, but it’s clearly quick,” said Whincup.</p>
      <p>“I think our drive is okay, we’re just struggling with a bit of turn. We’ll work on getting them to turn through that change of direction a little bit faster.</p>
      <p>“If we can do that, I think we’ll improve for tomorrow.”</p>
