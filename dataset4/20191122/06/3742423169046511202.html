      <h1>Save Up To $160 On A New 16-inch MacBook Pro</h1>

      <p>Apple products have been seeing tons of early holiday season discounts. We’ve covered as many of these as we can catch, but even if we miss a few, it seems like new ones are rolling in every day. One of the more recent deals is a modest—but still decent—discount on the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07XR5K7TG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=toyst-20&amp;linkId=a2e0a99571ae09714a22f2e27e90b780&amp;language=en_US&amp;sa-no-redirect=1">Apple Watch Series 5</a> though Amazon, as well as a small sale on the brand-new 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <h3>Apple Watch Series 5</h3>
      <p>The sale includes multiple Apple Watch models in various colours, materials, and watch face sizes, all of which affect the final price, but various models appear to be getting different markdowns. For example, the 44mm model with a Milanese band and a stainless steel case <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XQSTXDY/">is $US749 ($1,104)</a> (normally $US799 ($1,177)), while the 44mm model with a Space Black stainless steel case and black sport band <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07XR5K7TG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=toyst-20&amp;linkId=a2e0a99571ae09714a22f2e27e90b780&amp;language=en_US&amp;sa-no-redirect=1">is $US669 ($986)</a> (normally $US750 ($1,105)).</p>
      <p>Regardless of which model you buy, all of the on-sale Apple Watches include GPS and cellular connectivity; always-on retina displays; sensors that track heart rate, elevation, directional orientation, and more; and the ability to make emergency calls or send distress signals.</p>
      <p>Plus, you’ll get all the usual Apple Watch features, like being able to receive notifications from your paired iPhone or iPad, as well as various health, fitness, and communication apps.</p>
      <p>As I normally say when covering deals on Apple products, these tend to sell out quickly—especially on Amazon—so it’s best to act fast.</p>
      <h3>16-inch MacBook Pro</h3>
      <p>While the best “deal” for Apple’s new MacBook Pro is taking advantage of its educational store—if you can—to score yourself $US200 ($295) off the regular price of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">MacBook’s two iterations</a>, you can also turn to Amazon to save $US160 ($236) on <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B081FWLDZ2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=toyst-20&amp;linkId=2cd93aed8f2fea941803636252df3827&amp;language=en_US&amp;sa-no-redirect=1&amp;th=1">a brand-new, 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>. The caveat? The deal only applies to the Intel Core i7 version with 512GB of storage. Still, money is money.</p>
