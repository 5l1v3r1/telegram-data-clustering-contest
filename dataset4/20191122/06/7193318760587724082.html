      <p>A state grand jury has found a Blackwell police lieutenant at fault in the fatal shooting of a road rage suspect during an early morning pursuit.</p>
      <p>John Mitchell, 40, is accused in a second-degree murder indictment of causing the death of pickup driver Micheal Ann Godsey by firing approximately 60 rounds at her May 20.</p>
      <p>Grand jurors concluded he acted without justifiable or excusable cause and engaged in "imminently dangerous conduct" toward Godsey. If convicted, he faces at least 10 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Gary James said Mitchell acted lawfully to stop a threat.</p>
      <p>"It's a sad day for law enforcement and society," James said.</p>
      <p>The attorney described the suspect as a "violent, fleeing felon."</p>
      <p>"She shot at the police twice. She has shot at her mother twice. She has shot at a private citizen. We know she fired other rounds around town. And Mitchell gets in behind her," the attorney said. "He took his AR-15 and he started shooting through the front windshield at her."</p>
      <p>Both Mitchell and another officer fired further after the pickup abruptly turned and stopped, the attorney said.</p>
      <p>Godsey, 34, was found dead in the driver's seat of the pickup, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in May.</p>
      <p>The attorney said Mitchell had just completed training on how to deal with an active shooter and was cleared by an independent internal affairs review of the incident.</p>
      <p>The state's 17th multicounty grand jury returned the indictment Thursday in Oklahoma City in its final meeting. Overall, it returned 18 indictments and issued 1,093 subpoenas.</p>
