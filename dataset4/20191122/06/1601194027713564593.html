      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/arsenal">Arsenal</a> host <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/southampton">Southampton</a> at the Emirates as they aim to overcome a torrid run of form that has seen them slip to sixth position in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/epl">Premier League</a> standings. Unai Emery's side are currently eight points behind Manchester City in fourth place and are winless in their last five encounters domestically, a barren run that has piled on the pressure on the manager and put their top-four hopes in serious jeopardy.</p>
      <p>Southampton aren't doing too well themselves as they find themselves in the relegation zone, with only eight points from 12 league encounters and Ralph Hassenhuttl's position as Head Coach has come under immense scrutiny in the wake of their recent results. The South Coast club have won just two games so far and are just a point above Norwich City, who are rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table.</p>

      <h3>Arsenal vs Southampton Head-to-Head</h3>
      <p>While the home side are winless in the Premier League since their 1-0 victory against Bournemouth in late October, Southampton haven't won any of their last seven games in all competitions.</p>

      <h3>Arsenal vs Southampton Team News</h3>
      <p>Dani Ceballos is doubtful for this weekend's Premier League clash after sustaining a thigh injury and aside from the Spanish midfielder, Emery has no fresh injury concerns as he aims to turn the Gunners' season around. Granit Xhaka has not featured since his angry confrontation with the fans in Arsenal 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace and the Swiis international has also been stripped off captaincy since then.</p>
      <p>Emery indicated that the exiled midfielder could return to the matchday squad this weekend and Mesut Ozil could also feature for the third Premier League game in a row.</p>
      <p><b>Injuries:</b> Reiss Nelson (knee)</p>
      <p><b>Doubtful:</b> Dani Ceballos (thigh)</p>
      <p><b>Suspensions:</b> None</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Arsenal vs Southampton Predicted XI</h3>
      <p><b>Arsenal Predicted XI:</b> Bernd Leno, Hector Bellerin, David Luiz, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Kieran Tierney, Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Granit Xhaka, Mesut Ozil, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Arsenal vs Southampton Prediction</h3>
      <p>Arsenal aren't in the best of form but they should have enough firepower to breach the Southampton defence, especially at the Emirates. Aubameyang has been Emery's main man this season and the striker could be amongst the goals again against a hapless Saints side, who sit just a point above 20th placed Norwich City.</p>
      <p><b>Verdict - </b>Arsenal 2-0 Southampton</p>
