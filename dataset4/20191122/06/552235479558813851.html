      <h2>Jim Paterson is determined to get the better of Highland League Formartine United in Saturday's third round tie</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>East Kilbride caretaker boss Jim Paterson hopes to lead the side to Scottish Cup success this weekend – and boost his hopes of securing the K-Park hot-seat on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>Kilby head to Aberdeenshire tomorrow to face Highland League outfit Formartine United in round three, but they do so with speculation surrounding who will be the club’s next manager.</p>
      <p>Former Dumbarton boss Stevie Aitken, Rangers hero Ian Durrant and Civil Service Strollers boss Gary Jardine are among those being touted for the role.</p>
      <p>But Paterson has the job on an interim basis as it stands and knows a cup win this weekend could be really bolster his hopes of succeeding Stuart Malcolm.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a carrot for me in terms of having the chance to orchestrate us getting into the next round of the cup.</p>
      <p>“I’m in the position where if I can keep getting performances and results the board might not look any further than me.</p>

      <p>“But I can’t speak for the board and what they will want to do.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to throw my name in the hat for it and I’m probably in the best position for it because I have taken over the reins.</p>
      <p>“The board have not said anything to me other than get the squad ready for games in teams of training and squad selection.</p>
      <p>“I just want to win as many games as possible because that obviously helps me when it comes down to the crunch of selecting the next manager.</p>
      <p>“We have a winnable game this weekend, but I’m sure Formartine will be looking at us and thinking the same thing.”</p>

      <p>Paterson has a 100 per cent record so far with a 1-0 East of Scotland Cup win over Tynecastle last Tuesday night and a 2-0 league win over Gretna on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former Dundee United and Plymouth midfielder added: “I’ve loved it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been busy – I won’t lie about that – but it’s been great and I am ready to take a step up to being a manager.</p>

      <p>“It doesn’t surprise me if the club gets application after application, but I’m not worried about that.</p>
      <p>“I’m just worried about getting the players ready as best I can for the Scottish Cup tie.”</p>
      <p>Paterson knows the buzz getting to the later rounds of the cup can bring, having drawn Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in the FA Cup when he was with Plymouth Argyle in 2009.</p>
      <p>So after seeing EK’s Lowland League title defence falter under Stuart Malcolm, Paterson is looking for solace in the cup - and drawing a big name.</p>
      <p>He said: “In terms of the league we need snookers, so the cup is a chance for us to get some success.</p>
      <p>“I was at Plymouth when we drew Arsenal at the Emirates in the FA Cup and that was a huge occasion.</p>

      <p>“I still remember sitting at home watching the draw. Arsenal were the only big team left and we were ball 26, so when they came out I was saying “let it be 26” and the next moment I was dancing around the living room.</p>
      <p>“The cup is great and it gives us moments like that, so if we can do a job on Saturday and get through, hopefully I’m sitting down watching the draw and crossing my fingers for a big tie.”</p>
      <p>Saturday’s clash at North Lodge Park is a 3pm kick-off.</p>
