      <p>A Staffordshire-based hospice has launched a new campaign over the festive season.</p>
      <p>Katharine House Hospice is asking the public to ditch sending Christmas cards this year in hopes of receiving donations instead.</p>
      <p>"Give care not cards" is a fundraiser for patients of the hospice, with aims to provide them with a fun and memorable Christmas.</p>
      <p>"It's a chance to give patients a lovely Christmas filled with activities," said Andrea Pugh. "Those who are looking to take part have posters delivered from the hospice to their homes for a chance to write their own message to the patients, including their own donation."</p>
      <p>They were encouraged to launch the campaign with hopes to provide the patients with a good time over Christmas, especially for those who spend it on their own.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser proved to be extremely successful last year, and expect to have an even better one this year with even more donations.</p>
      <p>As well as the charities aim to raise money, they are also doing their part in helping save the environment by reducing the amount of paper being wasted this time of year.</p>
      <p>Katharine House, formerly known as Stafford Hospice Home, has been running since late 80s and has thrived since with more than 600 volunteers.</p>
      <p>The hospice runs off donations from the local community that helps generate two thirds of the funds needed to continue their care and all services offered are free of charge.</p>
      <p>The hospice's aim is to help people live life as fully as possible and to make most of the time they have, making the donations more vital during this festive season.</p>
