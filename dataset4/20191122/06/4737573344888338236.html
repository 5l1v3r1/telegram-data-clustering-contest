      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The first Talent Circulation Alliance — Women's Empowerment Expo (W-Expo) opened at Huashan 1914 Creative Park in Taipei on Thursday (Nov. 21).</p>
      <p>The event seeks to bring attention to initiatives mounted by Taiwan’s women associations and raise public awareness about women’s roles in society, reported <a href="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/2985372">Liberty Times</a>. It is jointly organized by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Development Council.</p>
      <p>Danielle Andrews, chief of the AIT Deputy Economic Section, noted that events like this will help promote local campaigns that benefit women while ultimately aiming at creating a society characterized by fairness, equality, prosperity, and peace, according to the report.</p>
      <p>"If you put money in the hands of women, all of society will flourish," said Andrews in a post on the Talent Circulation Alliance (TCA) Facebook page. The AIT spearheaded the event to cultivate a pool of internationally integrated and digitally savvy professionals.</p>
      <p>The W-Expo features the participation of 34 start-ups, with exhibits introducing empowered women in the food, marketing, and technology industries among others. The event ends on Friday (Nov. 22).</p>
      <p>Supported by the United States, the TCA is dedicated to fostering talent exchanges between Taiwan and like-minded partners. The TCA hosts four major events a year, including the Women’s Empowerment Expo, Talent Circulation Summit, International Job Fair, and Digital Society Summit.</p>
