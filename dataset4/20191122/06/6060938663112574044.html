      <h1>Salim Merchant on YRF pocketing Rs 100 crore in royalties: Sulaiman and I haven’t been paid for 4 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:08:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:08</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>Salim Merchant, of the composer duo Salim-Sulaiman, shocked <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> buffs on Thursday by alleging that the prestigious production house Yash Raj Films (YRF) has not paid him royalties despite having collected the same. He added that this was the reason he has not worked with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yash-Raj-Films">YRF</a> over the past four years.</p>
      <p>"Yash Raj has been collecting money on behalf of the composer and lyricist that much I know but I don't know whether they have paid anyone. They have certainly not paid me and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sulaiman">Sulaiman</a>," Salim told.</p>
      <p>He also claimed that the music label music company has also not cleared all his dues yet.</p>
      <p>The Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS), which comprises composers, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/singers">singers</a> and lyricists, reportedly filed an FIR against Yash Raj Films on November 20. It has been alleged that YRF has collected over Rs 100 crore in music royalty, which actually belongs to members of IPRS.</p>
      <p>Also, YRF has allegedly prevented artists of the IPRS from collecting royalties by pressurising them.</p>
      <p>Salim further claimed IPRS chairperson and veteran lyricist <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Javed-Akhtar">Javed Akhtar</a> has also been deprived of his dues.</p>
      <p>"I know Javed Akhtar sahab has not been paid, for sure... you know he's not been paid. Sulaiman and I have not been paid any royalties that have come from Yash Raj, we have not been paid," he further added.</p>
      <p>Most of Salim-Sulaiman's biggest hit songs are with YRF productions. These include music in films such as 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi', 'Mardaani', 'Ladies vs Ricky Bahl', 'Aaja Nachle', 'Band Baaja Baarat' and 'Chak De'! India, among others.</p>
      <p>The duo is now focusing on performing at concerts globally and composing singles, besides creating music for films.</p>
