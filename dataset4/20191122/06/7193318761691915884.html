      <p>Oklahoma teachers are painting a more complete picture of Thanksgiving as they embrace the Native American perspective of the holiday’s origins.</p>
      <p>School districts across the state have requested to use a lesson booklet developed from the Native American Student Services office in Oklahoma City Public Schools.</p>
      <p>For the past five years, the district has distributed the booklet, called “A Story of Survival: The Wampanoag and the English” to include Native American history and culture in the Thanksgiving narrative.</p>
      <p>“This idea came about because we had a lot of parents complain that they didn’t like that their children were learning inaccurate information about Thanksgiving. They didn’t like that their kids were making paper feathers,” Native American Student Services Director Star Yellowfish said. “There’s so much information out there now that there’s no reason why we can’t teach even our littlest kids the right information (and) the correct terminology.”</p>
      <p>Since the booklet’s inception, the Chickasaw Nation has shared it with every school in its tribal jurisdiction, said Yellowfish, who is Keetoowah Cherokee. The Native American Student Services office has received at least 10 to 15 requests from other districts to use it in their classrooms.</p>
      <p>Teachers had been struggling to find lesson plans that accurately and easily taught the Native American side of Thanksgiving, she said. Her department decided to create a concise booklet of historical facts, including the story of both the English colonists and indigenous tribes.</p>
      <p>The booklet planned multiple lessons through the lens of Native-based tales, such as “The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush” and “How the Stars Fell into the Sky.” It also advises schools to avoid Thanksgiving stereotypes and warns of culturally insensitive activities, such as making grocery bag vests and construction-paper headbands.</p>
      <p>First-grade teacher Alicia Strawn based two weeks of Thanksgiving lessons from the booklet. Her students at Heronville Elementary in Oklahoma City have created art projects based on the traditional Native stories.</p>
      <p>Her classroom wall is decorated with facts of the Wampanoag tribe, who taught English colonists to farm after their arrival on the Mayflower. The students covered facts of the tribe’s culture, traditions and how English separatists stole Wampanoag land.</p>
      <p>“Really seeing their mind shift of it’s not about turkey — it’s about how the Native Americans took in the pilgrims, the Wampanoag tribe specifically, and helped teach them how to survive,” Strawn said. “I’m trying to teach them what it means to have heritage and culture because that’s what the Native American culture is all about is carrying on those traditions and passing them from generation to generation so it doesn’t get lost.”</p>
      <p>Rochell Werito, who is Muscogee Creek and Navajo, conducted much of the research for the booklet as the Native American Student Services cultural programs director. Through her research, she learned the original account of the Thanksgiving meal came from what one colonist wrote in his diary.</p>
      <p>“It was all one-sided,” Werito said. “The Wampanoags, they didn’t have a voice or a say in his story because it was (based) on his one bias, basically. So, as the tribal people started telling their own story and their own history, we wanted to make sure all teachers know there’s two sides of every story and it’s not just based on that one man’s perspective.”</p>
