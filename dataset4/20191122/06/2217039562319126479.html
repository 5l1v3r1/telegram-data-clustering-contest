      <h3>RACE 1 (1,450M)</h3>
      <p><b>(3) AKWAAN</b> needed his last run and should make a bold bid.</p>
      <p><b>(12) TILMEETH</b> wasn't disgraced on debut and the blinkers are off.</p>
      <p><b>(9) AFRICAN DARTER</b> got tired after a rest and will be a lot fitter.</p>
      <p>Look for improvement from <b>(5) DUKE Of ABERCORN</b>.</p>
      <h3>RACE 2 (1,000M)</h3>
      <p><b>(2) WATCH ME NOW</b> has solid sprint form and could be hard to beat if on her A-game.</p>
      <p><b>(3) BAD HABIT</b> outran her odds when returning from a break to finish ahead of (4) CYBER BLOSSOM. Both are capable of posing a threat if building on those efforts.</p>
      <h3>RACE 3 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(14) LUCKY SHAMROCK</b> was a distant second on debut. She will come on heaps from a decent draw.</p>
      <p><b>(5) GUADELOUPE</b> has a wide draw to overcome which could prove costly.</p>
      <p><b>(9) STRAIT WORDS</b> will enjoy the extra distance.</p>
      <p><b>(1) MIDNIGHT TOP</b> will try lead from the jump.</p>
      <h3>RACE 4 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(13) WHAT A FLIRT</b> will not be a maiden for much longer and will be in the thick of things again. She was ahead of well-related <b>(2) ROCAMADOUR</b> and <b>(4) WHITE LACE</b> last time out and should confirm.</p>
      <p><b>(11) RATTLE MOUSE</b> and <b>(12) SPRINGISINTHEAIR</b> should be involved.</p>
      <h3>RACE 5 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(7) CORVETTE CAPTAIN</b> did well on debut and will relish the extra distance.</p>
      <p><b>(1) RIVER JORDAN</b> needed his first run. Should be at the finish.</p>
      <p><b>(3) FLYCATCHER</b> is on the up and shouldn't be far back.</p>
      <p><b>(11) TAHITIAN ORANA</b> is improving. The extra trip suits.</p>
      <h3>RACE 6 (1,800M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) HELEN'S IDEAL</b> will be better for the run after her comeback in a feature.</p>
      <p><b>(2) MIYABI GOLD</b> and <b>(4) DYNASTY'S BLOSSOM</b> haven't been racing since Gold Cup Day but are capable of running well.</p>
      <p><b>(5) PRINCESS IRENE</b> finished behind <b>(7) SNAPSCAN</b> recently but may turn the tables on these terms</p>
      <h3>RACE 7 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(6) SAINTS ALIVE</b> should be right there if relaxed in front.</p>
      <p><b>(3) AURELIA COTTA</b> has come well and can double up.</p>
      <p><b>(7) ROCKIN RUSSIAN </b>cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p><b>(8) EIGHTFOLDS LASS</b> is honest. Respect.</p>
      <h3>RACE 8 (1,000M)</h3>
      <p><b>(2) GOLDEN TRACTOR</b> won a stronger contest on debut and should see him follow up.</p>
      <p><b>(1) SKIDOO</b> finished 3.55 lengths behind but should pose more of a threat on these terms.</p>
      <p><b>(4) HARDFALLINGRAIN</b> blew his chances at the start last time out and could get in on the action if away on terms.</p>
      <p><b>(5) CAPE OF STORMS</b> may improve to get a look-in.</p>
      <h3>RACE 9 (1,800M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) YOUCANTHURRYLOVE </b>failed narrowly to complete a hat-trick recently but could resume winning ways.</p>
      <p><b>(13) HAWTHORN</b> impressed when winning second-up and the little extra trip will suit.</p>
      <p><b>(7) TOP RANK</b> wasn't disgraced on his comeback run and must be considered.</p>
      <p><b>(11) JACKMAN</b> disappointed on debut and should do better.</p>
      <h3>RACE 10 (1,000M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) COUSIN LIZ</b> enjoyed an undefeated juvenile year. She'll be using this as a pipe-opener ahead of a much-anticipated three-year-old campaign. Although she is not fully tuned, could be classy enough to preserve her unblemished record.</p>
      <p><b>(2) HILDEGARDE</b> is a formidable force with blinkers on and is likely to pose the biggest threat.</p>
      <h3>RACE 11 (1,800M)</h3>
      <p><b>(4) APACHE TOO</b> needed his last run and could chalk up a fourth victory.</p>
      <p><b>(6) SKIMINAC</b> is in form and the combo could complete a hat-trick.</p>
      <p><b>(2) OWLINTHETREE</b> has ability.</p>
      <p><b>(5) JAMRA</b> has money claims.</p>
      <h3>RACE 12 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) AFRICAN WARRIOR</b> caught the eye on his comeback in a Grade 2 feature behind none other than One World. He will be hard to hold out in this Guineas trial.</p>
      <p><b>(6) SEVENTH</b> a strong second string for the stable.</p>
      <p><b>(2) VIVA RIO, (3) MACTHIEF, (4) SNOW REPORT</b> and <b>(5) CANE LIME 'N SODA</b> can get a look-in.</p>
      <h3>RACE 13 (1,000M)</h3>
      <p><b>(3) KING OF THE DELTA</b> is holding form and should give another honest performance.</p>
      <p><b>(4) TOKOLOSH</b> is speedy and could grab a winning lead.</p>
      <p><b>(7) BOATSWAIN</b> could easily win this if ready after a break.</p>
      <p><b>(6) BRIDGE OF SPIES, (2) CERTIFIABLE</b> and <b>(10) ROYAL CAVALIER</b> can place.</p>
