      <h1>Gudeng, Marketech to gain from strong EUV equipment demand in 2020</h1>

      <p>Taiwan-based semiconductor equipment suppliers Gudeng Precision and Marketech International are expected to enjoy bright shipment prospect for 2020 as they have joined the supply chain of EUV equipment increasingly needed to support 7nm and more advanced process nodes, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>EUV lithography technology has replaced immersion technology as the mainstream for advanced process nodes as it can effectively shorten process flow and cut the layer number for mask pods to reduce overall costs, prompting TSMC, Samsung and Intel to adopt the EUV process. And ASML is now the only supplier of EUV lithography equipment for the leading foundry houses, with Gudeng and Marktech already venturing their mask pods and related modules into the supply chain, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Both Gudeng and Marketech have cooperated with the EUV equipment leader for years in developing highly customized precision devices, and they all are expected to benefit from the ever-expanding demand for EUV process equipment in 2020-2021, as such equipment is also likely to be adopted by leading memory chips makers, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Marketech now serves as a sales agent of high-tech equipment and materials, offers automatic system engineering services and conduct R&amp;D and production of customized equipment. Company chairman HM Kao said his company expects to see orders for advanced fabrication and packaging equipment and materials ramp up steadily next year along with sharp capex increases at major semiconductor clients.</p>
      <p>Industry sources said that the firm's order visibility has extended to the first half of 2020, with its revenues for 2020 likely to soar 5-10% on year and gross margins to increase to over 13% from 11-12% in 2019.</p>
