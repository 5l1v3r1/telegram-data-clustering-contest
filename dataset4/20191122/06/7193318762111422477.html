      <p>Attorney General Mike Hunter announced Thursday that the state plans to appeal a judge's order directing Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $465 million to fix the state's deadly opioid crisis. Hunter contends that is not enough money to fully abate the problem.</p>
      <p>Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman was correct in finding Johnson &amp; Johnson responsible for the state's opiod epidemic, but wrong in awarding only enough money to cover one year's worth of abatement efforts, Hunter argued in a news release.</p>
      <p>"We respectfully disagree with his order where it says Johnson &amp; Johnson must only fund one year of cleaning up the public nuisance he found Johnson &amp; Johnson created," Hunter said. "This limitation directly opposes evidence presented during trial and the state’s public nuisance law, which requires full remediation of the problem. It is crystal clear under Oklahoma law that once a company is found liable for causing a public nuisance, it must pay what it takes to clean it up until the nuisance is gone."</p>
      <p>Hunter said Balkman's ruling came after the judge found Johnson &amp; Johnson had "deceived and bombarded our doctors and Oklahomans with lies, leading to the deadliest man-made public health crisis in our nation’s history."</p>
      <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson previously announced that it, also, plans to appeal the ruling Balkman issued Nov. 15, but for far different reasons.</p>
      <p>Among other things, Johnson &amp; Johnson attorneys claim the state's public nuisance laws were wrongly applied to this case. The company claims it should owe nothing.</p>
      <p>"As was said when the judgment was announced, the company has very strong grounds to have the decision overturned," Sabrina Strong, Johnson &amp; Johnson's outside counsel said earlier.</p>
      <p>In a news release issued Thursday, Oklahoma's attorney general contended the state's public nuisance laws were correctly applied and pointed to testimony by state witnesses who said it will take a lot longer than a year to fix the state's opioid epidemic.</p>
      <p>From 2011-2015, more than 2,100 Oklahomans died from unintentional opioid prescription overdoses, Balkman noted in his final order.</p>
      <p>“During the trial, the state’s expert witnesses repeatedly testified that it could take up to 30 years or more to take our state back to where we were before the crisis began," Hunter said. "Our abatement plan was put together by some of the foremost experts in the state and nation on what it will take to overcome this tragedy that continues to grip our state. All of these experts agree that there are dire consequences if we do not end the crisis in its entirety, and that it will get much worse and more Oklahomans will die. Johnson &amp; Johnson had no abatement expert of its own and failed to present a competing abatement plan.”</p>
      <p>Attorneys for the state had asked the judge to order Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay more than $17 billion.</p>
      <p>The state and Johnson &amp; Johnson have until Dec. 16 to file file their appeals with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.</p>
