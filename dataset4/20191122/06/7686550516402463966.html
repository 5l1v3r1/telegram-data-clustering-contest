      <p>A man has been found guilty of the murder of backpacker Grace Millane in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The young woman from Wickford, Essex, was strangled by a 27-year-old man she had met on Tinder after spending several hours drinking in the centre of Auckland on December 1, 2018.</p>
      <p>The pair returned to his apartment and Ms Millane was killed either that night or in the early hours of the next morning - the date of her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said the man deliberately strangled her but his defence claimed Ms Millane died accidentally during sex.</p>

      <p>The jury of seven women and five men returned a unanimous verdict after just five hours deliberation at Auckland High Court.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grace-millane-man-found-guilty-20933408">The Mirror</a> reported that Auckland High Court heard how the man Googled 'flesh-eating birds' and 'are there vultures in New Zealand' as he researched how to dispose of her body.</p>
      <p>He then bought two suitcases and stuffed her body into one of them, before burying it in a shallow grave outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The defendant also arranged another Tinder date while Grace lay dead in his hotel room.</p>
      <p>The Crown successfully argued the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, strangled her and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>She was assumed missing and her father, David Millane, flew to New Zealand as local authorities spent a week searching until her body was found by police.</p>

      <p>Ms Millane's parents David and Gillian left the courthouse holding hands.</p>
      <p>Mr Millane wept as he told reporters: "The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace.</p>
      <p>"It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year.</p>
      <p>"Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>"Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever."</p>
      <p>The defence had claimed the death was accidental and occurred during rough sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p>Justice Simon Moore told jury members before they delivered their verdict that they had to be certain the man had murderous intent when he put his hands on Ms Millane's neck during sexual intercourse to convict him of murder, the New Zealand Herald reported.</p>

      <p>Mr Moore asked: "Are you sure that when he applied pressure to Ms Millane's neck... Did he intend to cause injury?"</p>
      <p>He further asked them to consider if the accused was willing to take the chance of Ms Millane dying due to his actions.</p>
      <p>"If yes, then (the defendant) is guilty of murder," the judge said.</p>
      <p>"In other words, (he) must have appreciated Ms Millane's death was a likely consequence... but was willing to run that risk."</p>
      <p>The court had been told Ms Millane had an interest in BDSM, with a previous sexual partner testifying they had used safe words and physical tapping to indicate when physical pressure became overwhelming.</p>
      <p>During the trial the jurors heard from forensic experts who examined the accused's apartment for blood stains as well as Ms Millane's body after her death.</p>
      <p>They were also shown footage of the woman and the defendant drinking at various bars throughout Auckland and kissing before they returned to his apartment.</p>
      <p>Video footage from the elevator of her exiting on the third floor marked the last recorded time Ms Millane was seen alive.</p>
