        <b>UPSET SPECIAL: Tennessee over Missouri</b>
      </p>
      <p>When Tennessee opened the season with a 38-30 loss to Georgia State and looked bad in doing so, the Volunteers appeared headed for a lost season and Jeremy Pruitt seemed shaky to finish out his second season as head coach.</p>
      <p>But after a 1-4 start, Tennessee has found itself. The Vols are 5-5, with victories over Mississippi State, South Carolina and Kentucky.</p>
      <p>Now Tennessee plays at 5-5 Missouri, followed by a season-ender against Vanderbilt.</p>
      <p>The Vols play at Oklahoma next season, and it seems possible that Tennessee could come to Norman with a lot of momentum. A 7-5 record could turn into an 8-5 record with a bowl win, and a seven-game winning streak by next September 12 is not out of the question.</p>
      <p>Missouri is a 4 1/2 favorite at home over the Vols, but let’s go with Tennessee in the upset.</p>
      <p>
        <b>COACH ON THE HOT SEAT: Arizona’s Kevin Sumlin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sumlin, part of Bob Stoops’ splendid OU coaching staff last decade, once was one of the hottest coaches in the game.</p>
      <p>Sumlin’s Houston teams went 35-17, and after Texas A&amp;M hired away Sumlin in December 2011, the Cougars spanked Penn State in the Ticket City Bowl.</p>
      <p>When Sumlin’s first A&amp;M team went 11-2 with Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, Sumlin’s stock soared. But the Aggies reverted to the mean, going 9-4, 8-5, 8-5, 8-5 and 7-5 the next five years, and Sumlin was fired to make way for Jimbo Fisher.</p>
      <p>Sumlin landed at Arizona and went 5-7 last season. UofA got off to a 4-1 start this season but since has lost five straight, and the Wildcats won’t be bowl eligible without a home victory Saturday over seventh-ranked Utah.</p>
      <p>Arizona is not a quick-trigger football school, so Sumlin’s job seems safe. But confidence in Sumlin’s ability to turn around a program is waning.</p>
