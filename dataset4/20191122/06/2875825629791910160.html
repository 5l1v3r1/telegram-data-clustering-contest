      <p>Brendan Maher has said that Johnny Kelly’s experience was crucial in navigating Borris-Ileigh to the AIB Munster club hurling final. <br/><br/>Having won their first Tipperary SHC in 33 years, facing back into action at provincial level seven days later was always going to be a tall order for Borris, but they made reasonably light work of Glen Rovers to set up a decider against holders Ballygunner. <br/><br/>Admittedly, the fact that the Glen were Cork’s representatives rather than their champions (Imokilly aren’t permitted to take part as they’re a divisional team) was an advantage for Borris, though they were still considerably less experienced than their opponents. <br/><br/>Their manager Kelly spearheaded Portumna’s trophy-laden era in the 00s but even they had a harsh lesson on the back of their first county title in 2003, with Dunloy beating them in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. <br/><br/>“The experience of Johnny Kelly was massive that week,” said Maher, as Borris sought to strike a balance between celebrating their win and preparing for the upcoming game. <br/><br/>“He spoke of his experience with Portumna. He referenced that a couple of times during the week and the regret they had. <br/><br/>“We enjoyed the county final, we celebrated it like we would have if we didn’t have a game but on the Wednesday night we got back down to training and there was a serious chat after that to say ‘we have four days so let’s give it everything. We may as well while we’re here’.</p>

      <p>“It is bonus territory but it probably would have put a bit of a dampener on the county final win if we didn’t get a performance. <br/><br/>“That was the motivation and if anything we performed with a little bit more freedom and confidence on the following Sunday and felt the pressure was off.” <br/><br/>Maher acknowledges that they are underdogs going to Pairc Ui Rinn on Sunday. <br/><br/>“Ballygunner have been an unbelievable team over the past number of years, totally dominant in Waterford and this is their third final. <br/><br/>“I won’t say it’s a win-win for us, we’re going to give it everything but if it doesn’t go our way it will still be a successful year for us so we are in bonus territory. <br/><br/>“The nature of us all and the competitiveness in us all, we’re not going down there on Sunday to make up numbers or we’re not going down there thinking we can’t win. We’re going down there to win and that’s the mindset we have.” <br/><br/>Tipperary clubs’ record outside of the county has been rather poor in the last few decades, with Borris-Ileigh’s All-Ireland win of 1986 the last time the Tommy Moore Cup has resided in the Premier County. <br/><br/>They haven’t amassed too many provincial titles either, Thurles Sarsfields in 2012 being the last, but Maher says that they take heart from the club’s winning pedigree. <br/><br/>“There’s a really proud tradition in Borris-Ileigh and it’s always been there and I suppose the fact that we won this year, we kind of feel part of that now and it does give you a lift to say that you’re part of a group that won a county title, just like those guys that we would look up to and are constantly talked about around the parish. <br/><br/>“The fact that we have that now, it gives you a huge lift so it does give you a bit of confidence. It does give you a bit more belief to say, ‘Well look, we are after getting over this hurdle, why can’t we get over another one?’”</p>
