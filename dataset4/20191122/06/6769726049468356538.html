      <p>A FIRE has engulfed a Ferndale home and damaged the house next door this morning, with the cost of damage estimated to be more than half a million dollars.</p>
      <p>A Department of Fire and Emergency Services spokesperson said a single-storey brick and tin roof house on Metcalfe Road, near the intersection of Clovelly Crescent, caught on fire.</p>
      <p>“We had a call come in at 9.50am,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The body of the fire looks to have started in the patio or garage area.</p>
      <p>“It looked like the house next door briefly caught on fire as well.”</p>
      <p>The DFES spokesperson said the fire caused an estimated $500,000 in damages to the Ferndale home and a further estimated $20,000 in damages to the structure next door.</p>

      <p>A St John Ambulance spokesperson said an elderly man was treated at the scene for minor smoke inhalation but was not transported to hospital.</p>
      <p>The fire was extinguished by 1.17pm but DFES have issued a Structure Fire advice for Ferndale residents.</p>
      <p>“People are asked to avoid the area due to the presence of asbestos,” the advice says.</p>
      <p>Roads have been reopened but motorists are asked to avoid the area as emergency services monitor the area.</p>
      <p>Eight fire appliances were at the scene.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHAT TO DO:</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a precautionary measure, people in the area should remain inside, out of the smoke or fumes, with doors and windows closed. Air conditioners should also be switched off.</p>
      <p>People should stay away from the area. If you are already in the area take advice from emergency services personnel.</p>
      <p>People with medical concerns should contact their local doctor or call Health Direct on 1800 022 222.</p>
