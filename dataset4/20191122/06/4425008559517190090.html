      <h1>Xerox threatens to take HP bid hostile</h1>
      <h2>Will go directly to shareholders if 'friendly' discussions don't occur.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:40:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/staff-writers-946766" target="_blank">Staff Writers</a></address>
      <p>Xerox on Thursday threatened to take its $33.5 billion (A$49.4 billion) buyout bid for HP Inc hostile, if the personal computer maker did not agree to a “friendly” discussion before November 25.</p>
      <p>HP on Sunday <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/hp-inc-rejects-xerox-deal-but-happy-to-keep-talking-534110">rejected Xerox’s offer of US$22 per share</a>, saying it undervalued the company, and that it was open to exploring a counter bid for the US printer maker.</p>
      <p>“We are confused by this reasoning in that your own financial adviser, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, set a $14 price target with a ‘sell’ rating for HP’s stock after you announced your restructuring plan,” Xerox wrote in its letter to HP.</p>
      <p>The median price target on HP stock by 15 analysts is US$20.</p>
      <p>HP did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.</p>
      <p>“Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders,” the company said in the letter.</p>
      <p>HP said on Sunday the combined company would be saddled with “outsized debt” and was not in the best interest of its shareholders.</p>
      <p>However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, and said it can evaluate the merits by accessing diligence information on Xerox.</p>
      <p>Xerox on Thursday said it has accepted HP’s request for due diligence, but that HP has refused to open its books to Xerox.</p>
      <p>“Any friendly process for a combination of this type requires mutual diligence - your proposal for one-way diligence is an unnecessary delay tactic,” Xerox wrote.</p>
      <p>Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.</p>
      <p>“Xerox’s move could force HP to propose a higher acquisition price that would benefit HP shareholders, or potentially turn the tables and have HP look to acquire Xerox,” Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said.</p>
      <p>Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox’s board last year with fellow businessman Darwin Deason, told Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has a 4 percent stake in HP.</p>
      <p>Xerox made the offer to HP, a company more than three times its size, on November 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.</p>
      <p>Shares of Xerox were up 1 percent, while HP’s shares were little moved.</p>
