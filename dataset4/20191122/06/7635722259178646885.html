        <b>The Immigrant Council of Ireland has said the discovery of 16 people in a truck container on its way to Wexford from France highlights the desperation of those forced to flee their homelands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardaí said the men are in good health after spending up to 12 hours in the truck container before being discovered by a ferry worker.</p>
      <p>The ferry was met by Gardaí and immigration officials at Rosslare and the men were transferred to a Dublin reception centre, where they spent the night.</p>
      <p>ICI spokesperson Pippa Woolnough said she was very glad to hear the Government say that it was taking a humanitarian approach to the incident.</p>
