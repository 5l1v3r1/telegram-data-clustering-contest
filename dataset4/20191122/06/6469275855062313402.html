        <b>A man who was rumbled by vigilant neighbours stealing hundreds of pounds of valuable metal from a Preston scrap dealer has appeared in court.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Preston Magistrates’ Court heard residents in Whitechapel, Longridge, near Preston, grew suspicious after hearing noises at nearby R W H Iron Design on the evening of July 9 last year.</p>

      <p>Andy Robinson, prosecuting, said: “ The scrap metal dealer owns a company on Bleasdale Road and he was warned by people who live nearby that sometime in the evening some people had been to his premises and taken metal.</p>
      <p>“He identified two pieces of metal, valued at more than £500, had been stolen. He says he would have turned the metal into other metal products worth £2,500.</p>
      <p>“The metal has been recovered.”</p>

      <p>David Ormerod, 53, of Butler Street, Blackpool, was arrested and has since pleaded guilty to stealing metal, and two of possessing a class B drug.</p>
      <p>He attended court on crutches and was permitted to sit outside the usual witness box.</p>
      <p>The bench was told in the time it has taken him to be prosecuted for the Preston offences, he has committed - and been sentenced for - similar offences in Bradford.</p>
      <p>But defending, Guy Nelligan said his “days of travelling in a car and collecting scrap metal are long behind him” as his mobility has declined since the offences.</p>
      <p>He got a 12 month discharge, £20 surcharge and £85 costs.</p>
      <p>*A 48-year-old man faces a trial in connection with the same theft next year.</p>
