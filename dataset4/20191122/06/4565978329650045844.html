      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- Katia María Rodríguez Ramos, a member of the provincial secretariat of the Cuban Workers Confederation (CTC, by its Spanish acronym), assured 26Digital that until November 20, comprehensive sanitation sessions took place in workplaces, in support of the eradication of vectors and especially of Aedes-type mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>The official said they did not want to miss the day without promoting efficiency, productivity and compliance with the plans of the economy in line with Che's laborious spirit and the need to accompany the challenges the country is at this stage of a resurgence of the blockade and international tensions.</p>
      <p>On November 22, 1959, Che and members of the Rebel Army convened the first volunteer workday, in Caney de las Mercedes, Bartolomé Masó municipality, in support of the construction of the Camilo Cienfuegos school, destined for some 20,000 children in the Sierra Maestra mountains.</p>
      <p>From that moment it was Che who with the force of his example extended, defended, argued and defined it.</p>
      <p>«Voluntary work should not be looked at because of the economic importance that today means for the State, voluntary work is fundamentally the factor that develops the consciousness of workers more than any other».</p>
