      <h1>Trolls attacking Nysa Devgan over wearing ‘inappropriate dress’ in temple should shut up</h1>

      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> actors <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> and Ajay Devgan’s daughter Nysa recently got trolled after a photo of her visiting a temple with her father. She invited wrath for wearing a cropped top in a religious place.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here’s what trolls said and why they should shut up:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Troll Attack 1: Such inappropriate clothes that expose the waist of a woman shouldn’t be worn in a temple</b>
      </p>

      <p>What we’re going to tell you is a done-to-death analogy. But just for the sake of these seemingly illiterate trolls, let’s just leave this here - “The two inch gap in saree is traditional and graceful but one inch gap in cropped tops is shameless”. Doesn’t make any sense, right?</p>
      <p>Where is it written that only traditional clothes ‘covering’ your entire body have to be worn to a temple?</p>
      <p>God is everywhere, not just in a temple or a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mosque">mosque</a> or a church. So by trolls’ flawed logic women shouldn’t be wearing crop tops, swimsuits, bikinis or skirts anywhere, because what if “God gets upset?”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Troll Attack 2: “Is she going to a temple or a gym?”</b>
      </p>

      <p>Is there a dress code in our constitution for these places? Did she violate any law by wearing what she wore? Isn’t the entire idea of going to a religious place to experience some peace within? Then what’s the harm if Nysa wanted to wear clothes she felt comfortable in?</p>
      <p>It’d be good if men going to temples and gyms concentrated on why they’re there instead of leering at women and focusing on what they’re wearing. If even in a temple you can’t help but gaze at a young girl, it’s better you don’t go to a temple at all.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Troll Attack 3: “My father would’ve slapped me for wearing that in a temple”</b>
      </p>

      <p>Well then, Nysa should thank her stars that she’s blessed with a liberal, understanding and sweet father who respects and supports her choices and lets her be. Hope all fathers will learn a thing or two from Ajay.</p>
