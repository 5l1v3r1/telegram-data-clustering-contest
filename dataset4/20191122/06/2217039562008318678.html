        <b>Online marketplace operator Carousell, which was started about seven years ago by three friends from the National University of Singapore (NUS), has made another leap in its growth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The firm has agreed to merge with 701Search, the classifieds firm owned by Norwegian telco Telenor Group, in a deal that values the start-up at over US$850 million (S$1.16 billion).</p>
      <p>Following the part-cash, part-equity deal, Telenor will be Carousell's new single-largest minority shareholder, with a 32 per cent stake in the company.</p>
      <p>701Search's three online marketplaces - Mudah in Malaysia, Cho Tot in Vietnam and OneKyat in Myanmar - will retain their individual names and operations, but will now report to Carousell chief executive Quek Siu Rui.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 701Search's regional hub team, which operates from Singapore, will be fully integrated into Carousell.</p>
      <p>Carousell's latest deal comes about seven months after classifieds giant OLX took a 10 per cent stake in the start-up, while injecting OLX Philippines into its business. Carousell added about 100 staff in the Philippines through the deal.</p>
      <p>Carousell was launched in August 2012 by Mr Quek and his friends, Mr Marcus Tan and Mr Lucas Ngoo. They were inspired by their year-long internships in Silicon Valley start-ups.</p>
      <p>The mobile classifieds app focused initially on items like electronics before expanding into categories such as clothing, property, cars and even jobs.</p>
      <p>In May, The Straits Times reported that the three co-founders were believed to own 8.75 per cent of the company each, which on paper translated to US$48 million per person.</p>
      <p>Said Mr Quek: "Merging with 701Search will allow us to further this mission on an even greater scale and fortify our leadership in South-east Asia as Mudah, Cho Tot and OneKyat are already leaders in their markets." - THE STRAITS TIMES</p>
