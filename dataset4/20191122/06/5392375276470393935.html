      <p>Recently a patent dedicated to a possible Mi Fold or even to Mi MIX Alpha 2 smartphone has appeared on the net, with a large folding panel in two points and a Quad Camera. Today we return to talk about a new patent from the company, which could belong to the alleged Xiaomi Mi Mix Dual Display, the protagonist of some rather fascinating images.</p>
      <h3>Xiaomi Mi MIX Dual Display shown by the images of a patent</h3>

      <p>The images above would show a smartphone with dual displays according to <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>, with a very different design than the Vivo NEX of some time ago. The alleged Xiaomi Mi MIX Dual Display comes with a rear Quad Camera and a small LED flash. The latter in the center of the body. In the upper right corner there is a secondary display. Where it is possible to display the date and time and – presumably – also the notifications. Obviously it is legitimate to imagine that this solution is devoted to selfies. Frontally, in fact, we have a large Full-Screen panel, without notches, holes and above all without the selfie camera.</p>
      <p>So, similar to the aforementioned Vivo NEX Dual Display. It will be possible to take advantage of the main camera for selfies, thanks to the mini display. At the moment there are no details on the patent in question. Only the images. Furthermore, if the patent was true. It is still a patent and it is not said that the device can actually see the light!</p>
