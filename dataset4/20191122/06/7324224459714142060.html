      <h2>People are being asked to give what they can to help an appeal to save Acorns children's hospice hit £500,000 and beyond - by order of the Peaky Blinders.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/richard-guttridge/" target="_blank">Richard Guttridge</a></address>
      <p>Steven Knight, the creator of the smash-hit series, is the latest big name to get behind the appeal, which is also being backed by the Express &amp; Star.</p>
      <p>Mr Knight is calling on people to give what they can to help keep the money rolling in. The appeal has got off to a fantastic start and is now just £50,000 shy of the half a million mark.</p>
      <p>The level of support has been so huge that the immediate threat of closure at the hospice has been lifted and planning has started for next year.</p>
      <p>However, Acorns still needs to reach £2 million if it is to survive until new NHS funding arrives in 2023.</p>
      <p>Peaky Blinders has grown into a global hit since hitting screens in 2013. The BBC series follows the Brummie gangster Shelby family and is partly filmed at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley.</p>
      <p>Birmingham-born writer, producer and director Mr Knight said in a video message: “I’m here to encourage you to help the Save Acorns Black Country Hospice Appeal. Lots of money has come in already, we just need a little bit more – we’re nearly up to half a million.</p>
      <p>“So please, if you can, give what you can. It’s a really worthwhile cause and if you do, it’s by order of the Peaky Blinders.”</p>
      <p>Mr Knight, a longstanding friend of Acorns, will be one of the stars of a special event next year, where he will be interviewed alongside Mayor of the West Midlands and Appeal Patron, Andy Street.</p>
      <p>He joins the likes of Noddy Holder, Julie Walters and Jasper Carrott in backing the appeal.</p>
      <p>Mr Knight has also donated a number of Garrison Tailors’ suits which are being auctioned to raise money for the appeal. The suits were worn by Birmingham City players to officially launch this season's kit.</p>
      <p>Acorns Chief Executive, Toby Porter, said: “If anyone had said to me at the start of the Appeal we would be on course to raising half a million pound in just four months, I would have been amazed. This is a wonderful, generous community and we are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped us reach this milestone.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of all of us at Acorns, a huge thank you to everyone who has backed this Appeal so far and to Steven for his expression of support, which I hope will help galvanise even more people to get behind our appeal.</p>
      <p>“There is still much work to be done. We are nearly a quarter of the way to our £2million target, but with your help I am confident we can get there. I urge everyone to see what they can do to support the appeal. Large or small, it doesn’t matter – it all makes a difference for our ability to help any child and family in the Black Country that will need us in the future.”</p>
