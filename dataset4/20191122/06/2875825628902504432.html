      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> has denied taking drugs while performing with One Direction.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old singer has admitted that he 'experimented' with illegal substances after quitting the band, saying that he bit the end of his tongue off in Malibu while high on mushrooms during the recording of his new album, Fine Line.</p>
      <p>Harry reflected on his time in One Direction on Zane Lowe's Apple radio show on Friday, saying he avoided drugs for fear of risking the band's success.</p>
      <p>Since leaving the band in 2016, Harry has said that he then felt safe enough to experiment.</p>

      <p>He told Lowe: "When I was in the band, it was like, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us that I kind of felt like, I'm not going to be the one who f***** it up.</p>
      <p>"So I was like, now is the time in my life when you probably go out and experiment and do this and you take this and you do that and that's what you do with your friends.</p>
      <p>"And I was like, I'm not going to be the guy who messes it up. So I was like, I'm not going to do any of that stuff."</p>
      <p>However, Harry said it was different while recording Fine Line at Malibu's famous Shangri-La studios, saying he felt "so safe".</p>
      <p>"Making this record felt like, I just felt so much more joyous and I was with my friends and we were in Malibu. I felt so safe," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was like, I want to take some mushrooms, now is the time to have fun. We're in Malibu, 24, I'm also in music."</p>

      <p>Harry told Rolling Stone magazine that while recording Fine Line, which will contain the singles Lights Up and Watermelon Sugar, he would "do mushrooms" and listen to the Paul McCartney album Ram and lie in the sunshine.</p>
      <p>Pointing to a corner at Shangri-La studios in Malibu, Styles said: "This is where I was standing when we were doing mushrooms and I bit off the tip of my tongue. So I was trying to sing with all this blood gushing out of my mouth. So many fond memories, this place."</p>
      <p>Fine Line will be released on December 13.</p>
