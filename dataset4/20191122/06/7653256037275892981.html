        <i>We see challenges because of the slowdown but called to make a relative bet, we think the Indian companies that we hold are in good position to take advantage of some of these challenges, says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Adrian-Lim">Adrian Lim</a></b>, Senior Investment Manager, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Aberdeen-Standard-Investment">Aberdeen Standard Investment</a></b>. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>What do you think about your Indian investments at present?<br/></b>There are pockets which are not working well and going through short term adjustment. In autos, the Bharat VI standards are being implemented over the next two quarters or so. There will be inventory issues, there will be stock clearance issues, there will also be an opportunity for some of these car makers to discount and gain market share. It will be an interesting and exciting time but by no means does it mean that all sectors requiring credit will continue to grow.</p>
      <p>We have large positions in our banking holding but because we think that over the longer term some of these short term blips will work their way out. In the case of our banking holdings, we are looking for franchises that have good reputation for managing credit profiles and credit control throughout the whole credit cycles.</p>
      <p>Also banks and financial institutions have good distribution capabilities and a strong reputation for managing capital well. If you identify those stocks and hold them through the medium and long term, you should come off better and that is the position we hold within the banking and financial space.</p>
      <p><b>You talked about slowdown in auto but you have invested in Maruti, Hero MotoCorp, Bosch and Castrol, which are facing disruption. The fortunes of Bosch could change if electric vehicles increase; Maruti could see a punch on its sales if there is a challenge in slowdown. Are you committed to your auto holdings in India for the next three-five years or could you revisit them in a substantial manner?<br/></b>We like to hold our positions for a long time but that does not mean that we do not monitor and pay attention to what they do. You mentioned four very good companies. They have a place in any portfolio where you want to diversify exposure into the Indian market. These are companies that will do well. The electric vehicles story will take some time to play out. Destruction fears have been exaggerated. We will see changes in the drivetrain, we will see changes in the way the energy is managed but it is not a business that will disappear overnight.</p>
      <p>We control our exposure by not having too much in the stocks that we think are either too pricey or where the earnings forecast is uncertain over the medium term and long term. Stocks like Hero, Bosch will continue to form the call of auto exposure in India.</p>
      <p><b>Given what is happening to the auto sector globally, is it your view that in India the existing auto companies will not face the heat of disruption?<br/></b>I do not think that autos around the world will face the heat of destruction. The auto cycle is currently weak but there are some very good companies globally that will be able to withstand the technology and the demand challenge. It is by no means clear how EV would pan out. There are four-five competing technologies, each of which have a credible case for being a viable option for going forward for the mass market.</p>
      <blockquote>Looking across the stock picking universe, we are comfortable with the relative weights we have in Indian consumer sector.<br/>-Adrian Lim</blockquote>
      <p>There are some considerable challenges for each of these technologies as well. In the shakeout, we will see good companies survive and continue to try but you need to be very selective about what you like. The added advantage of Indian autos is that stocks like Maruti, Hero are buffered to some extent from global developments because they cater to the local Indian market which have slightly different demands. It is not just technology, it is not just emissions, it is also affordability, styling and distribution. There are many things that come into play and these positions and the stocks that we talked about are measured that should do well in the long term.</p>
      <p><b>The heart of your portfolio is financial. Within that, you seem to be moving away from owning private banks. SBI Life insurance has entered your portfolio. You have exposure to Max Financial Services. Aditya Birla Capital. Are you looking at changing your not the weightage but the companies that you own within the financial sector. <br/></b>Well, there are some changes but if you look at the relative weights, you would see that the cornerstone positions in our financial services remain stocks like HDFC, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra. These form the core weights within the portfolio. SBI Life is interesting but it is not really purely PSU as well. SBI has incubated quite a few of these entities which are being run on a more commercial basis when it comes down to business plans and expansions, giving performance rewards to its employees and they have demonstrated very clearly that they can go toe to toe with the private sector financial institutions.</p>
      <p>It is clear that we need to keep an open mind. It is not just about PSUs versus private. There are many nuances within the Indian market. We need to keep an open mind and not be too simplistic about the way we categorise and see companies. There are good growth opportunities for the life insurance business and SBI Life is well positioned to be one of the best within the Indian life insurance sector. The other holdings that you talked about -- Max and Aditya -- have relatively small positions within the fund.</p>
      <p><b>But a purist would say that HDFC Bank, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/kotak-mahindra-bank-ltd/stocks/companyid-12161.cms">Kotak Mahindra Bank</a> have given good solid CAGR returns for 15-16 years in a row. They are expensive stocks to own. Can they continue to grow at historic rates because of base and can these stocks give historic returns that they have given in the last 15 years? What is your stand on that?<br/></b>Look at history. It gives you a sense of certain patterns but we do not go into a stock expecting to see historic numbers replicate themselves or repeat themselves over the next 15 years. The landscape is changing. There are challenges now that they did not have to content with 15 years back. There are challenges now that keep repeating themselves and they have had the opportunity to meet those challenges again and again.</p>
      <p>In those three banks, three financial institutions, what is important is that we look at quite a few things when we weigh up our banking holdings. We look at the strength and the competence level of the management teams. We look at the resilience of the business models that each of these financial institutions provide. We like the reputation of these institutions. We like the funding structure. We also like the fact that they continue to grow in spite of the fact that there are a lot of headwinds within the credit space in India.</p>
      <p>Since quarter three last year, the market has been anxious about financial institutions but these companies continue to post double digit loan book growth with minimal signs of margin stress and minimal signs of NPL expansions. So we like what we see and they will continue to form the core of what we hold within the financials space. We do not sit back and forget about these stocks. Every quarter, every six months, every year gives us a chance to revisit the investment hypothesis that we hold and we will do that. We will compare them against their peers. It is a competitive landscape and it is a challenging landscape and although they have done well in the past and in the present, we make no assumptions that they will guarantee outperformance in the future but that is the challenge and is the task what we have to do to evaluate them periodically to see that they continue to have the components that will deliver growth over the medium and long term.</p>
      <p><b>When you evaluate private banks, what are the factors and ratios which you monitor? Do you look at the spreads, the NIMs, credit growth? <br/></b>All those ratios that you talked about fall into any textbook knowledge of analysing banking stocks. It depends on how you weigh them and what time horizon you look at them and that might be slightly different for each investor. Net interest margin is important, non-performing loans numbers gross and net are important numbers, credit growth are important numbers but they are not the only thing and it is a mix of all these things that come to bear when we make that decision. We shared quite a bit. It is a theme that we look out for, the business model that we look out for and to make sure that the financials replicate the strategy and the managers represent the institution. All those things weigh heavily on the assessment.</p>
      <p><b>You have a large exposure to Nestle, HUL, ITC and even a relatively small position in Jyothi Labs. Now a) they are expensive, b) the base effect has kicked in and c) the Indian consumer sector right now is slowing down, how would you defend this?<br/></b>They have always been expensive. They have been expensive because the consumer staples space in India is priced to a high level. We like these franchises, these are stocks and they have a built in resilience because of the brand strength or what they put on the shelves and the distribution strength or what they put on the shelves that make their earnings numbers resilient but the valuations, you are right, are pricey which means that we have sizable amounts but we would probably have more if the valuations were cheaper.</p>
      <p>But this is what we are comfortable with at this point in time. Looking across the stock picking universe, we are comfortable with the relative weights we have in this sector.</p>
      <p><b>Some would argue that the outlier in your portfolio is cement. Within cement also, you own the big names largely because you are betting on India. But cement is a function of economic growth and that is where the puzzle is. Some are praying that India should recover and earnings should come back. But it is not happening.<br/></b>Yes, the cement story has taken longer to play out than we hoped but when you travel across India, you can see the needs are still there and it will come back and that is what we are positioned for. We are positioned not for the next quarter or the next two quarters, we have three to five-year timeframe in mind and we think that during that period of time, our cement exposure should come good. We are continuing to see sensible cost management policies, sensible capacity optimisation policies and our cement stocks continue to rest not on the laurels, but continue to improve their operations until the time when utilisation rates will pick up to strong levels again.</p>
      <p><b>You have been a long-term believer in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infosys-ltd/stocks/companyid-10960.cms">Infosys</a> and the corporate governance they have followed. What do you make of the whistleblower complaint there? Could it make a long term investor like you nervous about Infosys?<br/></b>Yes, every time a whistleblower pops up, it makes us think across our portfolios. It is not just in India, it is not just in Infosys, it is something that we take seriously and we pay attention to. We will wait until we get further clarity. It really depends. We have had some conversations with that company and we have had some assurances. We will take it from there. But yes, it is a concern but we also know that it is a very noisy environment at the moment and we want to make sure we do not overreact to things that pop up. We will take a measured view but it is something we take seriously.</p>
      <p><b>The charm for India was that India has some fantastic companies with high return ratios and great corporate governance. Unfortunately, there have been some corporate governance slippages and some major corporates have done that. Could that make you nervous? Could that have an impact on the India aggregate premium because what India commanded was quality and high return ratio companies? If that is compromised for a market, if the earnings were not there, could PE multiple contract?<br/></b>They could contract. PE multiples could contract or your earnings base could expand because you are difficult period in the cycle where the economy is firing in all cylinders. There are various challenges across different sectors, there is underutilisation because of over built capacity in certain other sectors. So yes, a few things could happen. The PE numbers could come down but the earnings base could increase as well making the PEs deceptively expensive.</p>
      <p>When you talk about PE premiums for India as a market as a whole, it is not just about the quality of governance, it is also about the quality of the underlying growth within the system. There is under penetration within quite a few of these sectors and it is a multi generation story in many-many verticals and many sectors. We are not talking about a growth cycle that will last one or two years, we are talking about a growth cycle that will last a generation or two. That is the ultimate attraction of a marketplace and an economy like India.</p>
      <p>I think governance is a tricky one to attribute the premium to. We do not take it for granted that every company that comes off a particular market has a particularly high or low governance. You keep an open mind and then you pay attention to what the promoters do, you pay attention to the related party transactions and you pay attention to how directors and senior management team are evaluated and paid and rewarded. All those things come to weigh in on what we call governance.</p>
      <p>It is very much a case by case basis. We see good companies in markets that reputably have bad governance or poor governance and we see bad companies in countries that have good governance. So I would not take it on face value.</p>
      <p><b>At an aggregate level, what is your India positioning within allocation? Are you overweight, marginally underweight, where do you stand there?<br/></b>We are overweight India. It has been a relatively volatile market in the last three years. There are periods of time when we have taken profit and there are periods of time that we built up. We are currently overweight in India but over those three years, we have always been overweight in India within our regional portfolios.</p>
      <p><b>Two years ago, Martin said that look we like India but we think China offers better value and we are happy to revisit Chinese stocks. Could that be a stance or do you think you could remain overweight for India for the next one, one and a half year?<br/></b>Well we have been expanding our weight in China. The interesting thing is that it depends on what portfolio you are talking about. When you look at Asia as a whole, you cannot ignore India or China or Indonesia or Vietnam or Southeast Asia. There are pockets in each of these markets that are attractive. You cannot ignore Korea and Taiwan as well.</p>
      <p>It is not a case of India versus China, we are given the choice of buying and picking the best stocks we can in Asia. You will get good companies from these two countries. Now the interesting thing for us is that over the last two, three years we have been expanding our Chinese exposure in our regional portfolio, but that is not explicitly at the expense of India. But just because we have been doing that for the last three years, does not mean we will continue to do that for the next three years.</p>
      <p>These are stock specific driven decisions, where we compare stocks across sectors across different markets and we do not take a top down approach. Our decision making is very much built on bottom up stock analysis and the relative attraction of the stocks regardless of which markets they operate in.</p>
      <p><b>I know you do not track liquidity but we both know that liquidity plays a very large role at least in the medium term. In six months to one year, liquidity decides which way stock prices will move. What is your sense on the way how emerging market flows have behaved? What has been your experience in emerging markets outflows and inflows with your clients?<br/></b>We have seen quite a lot of volatility within our own portfolio. It has been relatively modest. We have been able to manage that liquidity reasonably well but it is impossible to predict. A lot of this is very much dependent on sentiment and outflows. I do not think I am representative of the wider market flows. All the time, it comes and it goes. I would not venture to predict where liquidity will be six months from now.</p>
      <p><b>If you have to summarise our today’s interaction can I say that you remain committed, that you are bullish and are reasonably confident about the India growth story and the portfolio companies where you have invested in? You do not see a problem due to slowdown?<br/></b>We see challenges because of the slowdown but called to make a relative bet, we think the Indian companies that we hold are in good position to take advantage of some of these challenges. But there are challenges within the slowdown not just in India, but across the region and the world as well.</p>
      <p><b>You had a large exposure in BPCL. It was not a very profitable trade for you but now BPCL is on the block. If a company like BPCL or Container Corporation which you have owned in the past is privatised, will you look at it?<br/></b>Well, I need to correct you on a few things. BPCL was a decent investment for us but it is something that we have not held for more than 10 years. Container Corporation we continue to hold and if a state-owned enterprise becomes available for a greater free flow, whether or not we would participate is something that we always open to. We need to weigh the benefits and the cost of those things relative to what else is available out in the market.</p>
      <p>I think India has enough choice and that additional placement will not significantly change the options and decision making but we will always be open to placements like that. We are trying to understand and educate ourselves.</p>
