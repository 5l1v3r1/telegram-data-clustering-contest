      <h1>Bristol City, Leeds United and the rest of the Championship's most valuable players on Football Manager 2020</h1>
      <h2>The football management simulator has some high valuations for some the league's top talents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>With the January transfer window fast approaching, clubs will not only be looking to bolster their sides, but keep hold of their best players.</p>
      <p>The price of players has sky rocketed over the past decade and Championship players can now easily be sold for north of £10 million.</p>
      <p>According to the Football Manager 2020 game, which was released on Monday, most Championship clubs have a player in their squad who could fetch between £6 million and £20 million.</p>
      <p>The game has valued the likes of Fulham's Ivan Cavaleiro and and Stoke's Badou Ndiaye very highly, while <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-ratings-football-manager-3561889">Tomas Kalas is rated as Bristol City's most valuable.</a></p>
      <p>Take a look at each club's most valuable player, according to the game.</p>
      <h3>Barnsley - Cauley Woodrow</h3>
      <p>Value: £6.5m</p>
      <p>The former Bristol City striker has scored six goals in 13 Championship appearances this season for Barnsley, making him the most valuable player in the squad.</p>
      <p>While he didn't have the best of times on BS3, he has flourished since joining the the Tykes and could land you millions if you decide to sell him on the game.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Birmingham City - Ivan Sunjic</h3>
      <p>Value: £10m</p>
      <p>The combative midfielder has some incredible stats in the new version of Football Manager, rated up to 20/20 for bravery and up to 19/20 for determination.</p>
      <p>The Croatian's potential makes him very expensive and he could be difficult to keep hold of on the game if the big clubs come calling.</p>
      <h3>Blackburn Rovers - Bradley Dack</h3>
      <p>Value: £13.5m</p>
      <p>No surprise here. The forward has previously been linked with the likes of Sheffield United, Aston Vila and West Brom but has stayed in Lancashire and continued to score the goals.</p>
      <p>Dack scored 15 goals in the Championship last season and has so far bagged five in this campaign. He is sure to be linked with a host of clubs during the January window.</p>
      <h3>Brentford - Pontus Jansson</h3>
      <p>Value: £13.5m</p>
      <p>It came as a shock to many when Pontus Jansson joined Brentford from Leeds after a reported fallout with Marcelo Bielsa.</p>
      <p>However he is still considered a top defender and it would take some price tag to sign him on the game.</p>
      <h3>Bristol City - Tomas Kalas</h3>
      <p>Value: £8m</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea defender joined City in a record transfer in the summer after a successful loan spell.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3519081.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JMP_Hull_City_v_Bristol_City_RS_028JPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Bristol City defender Tomas Kalas</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He continued his fine form at the start of the season before an injury lay off and is rated highly for bravery and pace on Football Manager.</p>
      <h3>Cardiff City - Joe Ralls</h3>
      <p>Value: £13.5m</p>
      <p>Cardiff academy graduate Ralls continues to impress for the Bluebirds and the midfielder is having another stellar season in the Championship.</p>
      <p>He has scored five goals already in the current campaign and is Cardiff City's most costly player on the game.</p>
      <h3>Charlton Athletic - Beram Kayal</h3>
      <p>Value: £5.75m</p>
      <p>The midfielder, on loan from Brighton and Hove Albion, is most likely so costly due to his Premier League experience.</p>
      <p>However he has only managed six appearances in the league so far and scored no goals, so there could be better options on the game to invest in.</p>
      <h3>Derby County - Tom Lawrence</h3>
      <p>Value: £8.25m</p>
      <p>The versatile forward and former Manchester United academy prospect has continued to perform for the Rams.</p>
      <p>He is rated highly for dribbling, technique and agility in the game and valued higher than any other Derby player.</p>
      <h3>Fulham - Ivan Cavaleiro</h3>
      <p>Value: £20m</p>
      <p>Cavaleiro is the most costly player in the Championship on Football Manager.</p>
      <p>The Wolves loanee has combined well with Mitrovic and Knockaert this season in a very expensive front three. His acceleration and flair are his best attributes on the game.</p>
      <h3>Huddersfield Town - Terence Kongolo</h3>
      <p>Value: £18m</p>
      <p>The former Monaco and Feyenoord defender is rated highly for tackling and aggression on the game and could bank any budding Huddersfield boss a tidy price.</p>
      <p>He was a mainstay is the Terriers 2018/19 Premier League season and his price tag shows.</p>
      <h3>Hull City - Jarrod Bowen</h3>
      <p>Value: £11.25m</p>
      <p>Bowen has been one of the Championship's standout performers this season and is keeping Hull afloat alongside Kamil Grosicki.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has scored nine goals so far in the league and is rated highly for dribbling and determination on the game.</p>
      <h3>Leeds United - Helder Costa</h3>
      <p>Value: £18m</p>
      <p>Another Wolves loanee to make the list, Costa is one of many highly valued Leeds players alongside the likes of Pablo Hernandez and Kalvin Phillips.</p>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3563711.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Millwall-v-Leeds-United-Sky-Bet-Championship-The-Den.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Helder Costa is one of the most costly Championship players on the game<cite>(Image: PA)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He has struggled so far this season but has the quality and the Premier League experience to be a good addition to your squad if you want to splash out on the game.</p>
      <h3>Luton Town - Isaiah Brown</h3>
      <p>Value: £9.5m</p>
      <p>The Chelsea loanee has been performing well in a struggling Luton side after a difficult season with Leeds last year, providing five assists for the Hatters.</p>
      <p>In a team of low value Luton players, it's clear to see why a player of Izzy Borwn's potential is valued so highly.</p>
      <h3>Middlesbrough - Darren Randolph</h3>
      <p>Value - £9.5m</p>
      <p>Perhaps surprising that Britt Assombalonga isn't top of the Middlesbrough list, but Darren Randolph is one of the best keepers in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Despite only keeping two clean sheets so far this season, his shot stopping is one of the best aspects of his game and this is reflected in his high ratings for reflexes and handling in Football Manager.</p>
      <h3>Millwall - Jed Wallace/Ben Thompson</h3>
      <p>Value: £6.5m</p>
      <p>Both Wallace and Thompson have appeared in the majority of Millwall's games this season and are the most valuable players in a low value Lions side.</p>
      <p>Wallace has six goals to his name this season and it is no surprise that he is one of the club's most costly players.</p>
      <h3>Nottingham Forest - Joe Lolley</h3>
      <p>Value: £10.75m</p>
      <p>Highly rated on the game for dribbling and stamina, Lolley would bank any budding Forest manager a lot of money if they decided to cash in.</p>
      <p>He won Forest's player of the season award last season and has continued that form this season, scoring three goals and providing two assists.</p>
      <h3>Preston North End - Ben Pearson</h3>
      <p>Value: £9.5m</p>
      <p>The Manchester United youth product has been with Preston since 2016 and has been a consistent player since joining.</p>
      <p>He struggles with his discipline, picking up 14 yellows cards for three seasons in a row between 2016 and 2019, but if that becomes an issue in game you'll get a good price for him.</p>
      <h3>QPR - Nahki Wells</h3>
      <p>Value: £8.5m</p>
      <p>The Burnley loanee failed to impress in the Premier League, but has already proven his worth in the Championship during his previous spell with Huddersfield.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article3189293.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1125074344.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Nahki Wells in action for QPR<cite>(Image: Getty)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He has scored eight goals already this season for QPR and would be worth the investment on Football Manager if you need to buy a Championship striker.</p>
      <h3>Reading - Matt Miazga</h3>
      <p>Value: £14.5</p>
      <p>Another Chelsea loanee to make the list, the American defender is valued highly despite only making two appearances for the Blues.</p>
      <p>He is rated highly for heading and tackling but any Football Manager player who choses to manage Reading will be unlikely to sign him permanently at that price.</p>
      <h3>Sheffield Wednesday - Adam Reach</h3>
      <p>Value: £8.75m</p>
      <p>Reach has weighed in with one goal and three assists so far this season.</p>
      <p>It is most likely his age and potential which makes him so valuable to Wednesday, having already played 138 times for them at the age of 20.</p>
      <h3>Stoke City - Badou Ndiaye</h3>
      <p>Value: £17.75m</p>
      <p>Stoke's midfielder was linked with a move away in the summer after a loan spell at Galatasaray for the 2018/19 season.</p>
      <p>However, that didn't materialise and he has been one of the Potters' top performers this season, justifying his high value.</p>
      <h3>Swansea City - Borja Baston</h3>
      <p>Value: £10m</p>
      <p>The Spanish striker came out of nowhere at the start of this Championship season after failing to impress for the Swans in the Premier League, scoring six goals before the end of Septemeber.</p>
      <p>He has struggled since the Swans beat Reading in September, and if he struggles in the Championship on Football Manager he has a good price on his head.</p>
      <h3>West Brom - Matt Phillips</h3>
      <p>Value: £11.25m</p>
      <p>Despite Matheus Pereira's incredible season for the Baggies, it is Matt Phillips who tops the most valuable list for West Brom.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3563716.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Stoke-City-v-West-Bromwich-Albion-Sky-Bet-Championship.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Matt Phillips of West Bromwich<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He has been a consistent performer for West Brom since joining in 2016 and could hack it in the Premier League in game if a manager decides to splash out.</p>
      <h3>Wigan Athletic - Sam Morsey</h3>
      <p>Value: £6.75m</p>
      <p>Sam Morsy is another player who is a consistent Championship performer.</p>
      <p>He is the most valuable in a Wigan squad of low value players, rated highly in the game for tackling and work rate.</p>
