      <h2>Questions have been asked about the fly-half's absence this season</h2>

      <p>Ian Madigan still has a part to play at Bristol Bears says Pat Lam despite the fly-half falling down the pecking order at the Gallagher Premiership club.</p>
      <p>Madigan is fit, but has not been named in Bristol's last six matchday squads in the league and now European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Thirty cap Irish international played in the Bears' final Premiership Rugby Cup defeat to Exeter Chiefs - which was essentially a pre-season friendly and last featured for the club in a friendly against Oxford University. </p>
      <p>Madigan joined Bristol from Bordeaux Begles in 2017/18 and played a key role in leading the club to promotion out of the Greene King IPA Championship.</p>
      <p>The Former Leinsterman was the second tier golden boot winner, named in the league XV of the season and then picked up the Championship player of the season award.</p>
      <p>Madigan, 30 started the 2018/19 season with Bristol back in the Gallagher Premiership as the club’s first choice fly-half and played a starring role in some dramatic victories thanks to his kicking; but one of the stories of the season was the emergence of Callum Sheedy as a top flight 10 - so much so he earned a call-up to play for England in an uncapped game against the Barbarians at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>Tellingly it appears Sheedy has the natural running game and creative passing range to suit director of rugby Pat Lam’s desired style of play.</p>
      <p>And now 18-year-old Ioan Lloyd has emerged as the next top talent out of academy, winning the man of the match award last weekend on his European debut as the Bears dismissed Italian side Zebre 59-21.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the performance, Lam said: “It was another assured performance from a young man.</p>
      <p>"That is the beauty of our culture and our structure, he understands it and he is able to get in there. He didn’t have to call all the shots, because 10s don’t do that in our game, everyone has a responsibility to drive our game.</p>
      <p>"We really wanted to give him a go there, because having someone who can play 15 and 10 on the bench is massive, but we have been fortunate enough that nothing has happened to Callum Sheedy yet when he has played. We thought we needed to give him a game in the 10 jersey to give him confidence and the team confidence that if he is on the bench he can definitely cover fly-half. He did really well."</p>
      <p>This week, against Brive tonight, Sheedy starts with Lloyd on the bench.</p>
      <p>Asked about the absence of Madigan this season, who is not injured, Lam said: “For us to be successful we have to have competition.</p>
      <p>“Competition, guys coming in having clarity of what we want to do.</p>
      <p>"What you have done before, and who you are, all comes into the melting pot but ultimately it is about the here and the now and understanding it is not coming in and playing say Charles Piutau’s way, it is Charles Piutau playing the Bears’ way. Callum Sheedy playing the Bears’ way and that gives the young guys, and everyone, really confidence that they get judged on how they perform their role here.</p>

      <p>“I have always said if you are good enough you are old enough. If you perform you will get games and I think I have shown that right through.</p>
      <p>"If you come in and do the job then you will get another chance, and another chance, and I want all the guys in our squad to push the guys here and for players to go on improving.</p>
      <p>"It is great to have Callum [Sheedy], Ioan [Lloyd] Mads [Ian Madigan], Tiff [Eden] - we are going to need everybody as we go through. It is still early in the season. Guys will get chances but I don’t know when that is going to happen. We just go week to week and that is the way we have been working.”</p>
      <p>Madigan is in the final year of his three-year contract at the Bears and it appears his time at the club could be numbered.</p>
      <p>With Bristol Bears A playing London Irish in the second tier development competition the Premiership Rugby Shield on Monday night it will be fascinating to see whether Madigan is given a run out.</p>
