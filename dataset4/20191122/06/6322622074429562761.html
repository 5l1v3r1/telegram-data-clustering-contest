      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): CSC Steel Holdings Bhd's net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 rose more than threefold to RM10.53 million from RM2.98 million a year earlier, on improved margin underpinned by an increase in domestic sales and favourable raw material cost.</p>
      <p>In a filing today, CSC Steel said revenue for the quarter increased 5.1% to RM353.67 million versus RM336.59 million earlier.</p>
      <p>For the nine months ended Sept 30, CSC Steel's net profit rose to RM27.74 million versus RM23.97 million previously, on flattish revenue of RM1.03 billion.</p>
      <p>On its prospects, CSC Steel said along with the trend in international steel prices, the Malaysia market has taken a wait-and-see approach attributable to the uncertainty in the current steel market.</p>
      <p>It said that as the biggest end-consumer of steel, the construction sector has revealed a substantial fall in sales.</p>
      <p>"To get through the tough times, the group will adhere to prudence and conservatism, consolidate the domestic market, continue to promote the development of high-grade and high-value products, attentively track the import dynamics to prevent unfair competition, and enhance its competitiveness among other competitors in the domestic market," it said.</p>
      <p>CSC Steel said barring any unforeseen circumstances, it is cautiously optimistic of achieving positive results in 2019.</p>
      <p>At the midday break, CSC Steel's share price was unchanged at RM1, valuing it at RM380 million.</p>
