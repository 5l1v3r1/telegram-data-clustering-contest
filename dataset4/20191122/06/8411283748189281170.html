      <h1>Acter to gain from renewed IC plants construction in China in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:51:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:51</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Taiwan-based clean room engineering specialist Acter is expected to see its revenues pick up steadily in 2020 as major clients in Taiwan and China will boost capex to step up major plant construction projects amid the growing demand for high performance computing (HPC) chips for 5G and AI applications, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>The firm's revenues for the first three quarters of 2019 came to NT$9.44 billion, down from a year earlier due mainly to Chinese clients reducing their capex amid the US-China trade war. But the clients have gradually reactivated their construction projects, ramping up their orders with the firm in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Acter now has over 50% of revenues contributed by semiconductor clients, and is expected to see the revenues regain growth momentum in 2020, given that TSMC has raised its capex by 40% to US$14-15 billion for 2019 and 2020 to meet strong demand in 5G deployment and China's semiconductor industry will increase equipment purchases for new plants next year, the sources said.</p>
      <p>An SEMI research report indicates that global semiconductor equipment sales will resume positive growth in 2020, mainly driven by 5G and AI applications, with China to stay as the largest equipment market.</p>
      <p>Other research units estimated that China's 5G capex will grow to CNY1.5 trillion (US$213.37 billion) during the 2019-2015 period, and its IC self-sufficiency rate will rise to 20.5% in 2023 from 15.3% in 2018, which will be accompanied by constant growth in demand for clean rooms and other semiconductor equipment, the sources said.</p>
