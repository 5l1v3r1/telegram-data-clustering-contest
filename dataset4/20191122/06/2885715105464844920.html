      <p>A fight that broke out during a cricket match in Bengaluru cost a 20-year-old his life, as he was stabbed to death by a friend and three others.</p>
      <p>The incident took place Wednesday night near Nandini Layout in the city. The deceased, G Uma Maheshwar, was a BBA student. Search for the accused, identified as Chandan, a resident of Chikkabidarakallu, is still on, Nandini Layout police told <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">Indianexpress.com</a></i></p>
      <p>According to the police, the youngsters got into an argument during a game of cricket played Monday evening at the Kamalammangudi Grounds in Mahalakshmi Layout. “Maheshwar slapped Chandan after the latter refused to accept that he was run out during the game. This led to Chandan getting three others, including a minor, to accompany him and stab Maheshwar next to his house around 7.30 pm on Wednesday. The assailants came on two bikes,” the police said.</p>
      <p>Maheshwar, who was rushed to a hospital nearby, succumbed to his injuries Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>A police officer said, “The accused seems to have left the city fearing arrest.

His identification information has been shared across police stations, including those on the outskirts of the city, which will help us trace him soon.”</p>
