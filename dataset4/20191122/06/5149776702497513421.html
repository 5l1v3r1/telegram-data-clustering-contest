      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:24:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>Quick-thinking police officers saved a man's life after he was found in a Stapleford garden suffering from multiple stab wounds.</p>
      <p>PC Alison Bryan, 38, even made a makeshift tourniquet out of a ripped t-shirt while her colleague PC Ben Price, 23, applied pressure to stop the victim bleeding to death.</p>
      <p>The pair have now been commended by the Chief Constable of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, Craig Guildford, for their actions in the early hours of August 11 last year.</p>
      <p>PC Bryan told Nottinghamshire Live: "We potentially saved the man's life.</p>
      <p>"His main artery had been slashed in his leg and me and Ben got there first and put pressure on his groin to stop the bleeding and then we put on a tourniquet, which I made out of a t-shirt.</p>
      <p>"After he had the operation at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">Queen's Medical Centre </a>we were told we had saved his life because he would have bled out."</p>
      <p>Police were called to Hicklings Lane after reports that a man, aged 32, had been stabbed following a dispute.</p>
      <p>The incident concluded in a nearby garden in Pasture Road.</p>

      <p>At the time, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/residents-react-stapleford-stabbing-too-1886592">residents described how they woke up to find a large cordon </a>and forensic officers surrounding their drive ways.</p>
      <p>Five men were arrested on suspicion of grevious bodily harm, but the officers said the charges have been dropped due to "evidential difficulties."</p>
      <p>PC Bryan said: "It is the first major stabbing I have been to and I have been in the force for 10 years. It was horrific because he was clearly struggling to breathe and heavily bleeding.</p>
      <p>"Everything you have been taught just kicks in. It is nice to be rewarded but it is part of my job."</p>
      <p>PC Price, who has been an officer for three years, added: "It was definitely a team effort. We knew he had a catastrophic bleed.</p>
      <p>"We only saw one stab wound but then we noticed there was multiple ones to his leg. I put pressure on the inside of the groin to keep him conscious."</p>
      <p>PC Price said it was "nice to be recognised".</p>
      <p>"I did what I did to save his life," he added.</p>
      <p>Both were awarded at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police Awards</a> held at the Albert Hall on November 21 for their "quick-thinking and precise actions."</p>
