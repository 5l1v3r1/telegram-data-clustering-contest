      <h1>Liam Hemsworth’s Sister-In-Law Disses His Ex Miley Cyrus – Says ‘He Deserves Much Better’ Than Her!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:32:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:32</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>It turns out that Liam Hemsworth’s sister in law, Elsa Pataky, is not a big fan of his ex, Miley Cyrus which is why she is actually no less than relieved the two are no longer a married couple! In fact, she was not afraid to argue that husband Chris’ brother ‘deserves much better’ than Miley!</p>
      <p>As you know, Elsa is happily married to Chris Hemsworth and she apparently wants the same for her husband’s little brother.</p>
      <p>But the happiness and love they share could not have been achieved by Liam with Miley – she seems to believe – which is why she is rather relieved they are no longer together.</p>
      <p>The Spanish beauty was in Madrid for the Christmas campaign of Women’s Secret lingerie launch since she’s an ambassador for that brand and that is when she made the bold comments about Miley.</p>
      <p>Elsa started by updating fans on how her brother in law has been doing post-split and she then proceeded to slam his ex without a problem, making it very clear that there is no love lost between them.</p>
      <p>‘My brother in law, well…After a relationship that you have dedicated 10 years to, he is a little down, but he is coping well. He is a strong boy and deserves the best, I think he deserves much better,’ Chris’ wife said, candidly.</p>
      <p>Liam and Miley were together on and off for about a decade and finally tied the knot around Christmas last year.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, they lasted only a few months as a married couple as, this past summer, their relationship came to an end.</p>
      <p>They separated and it looks like Liam was the one to file for divorce in August.</p>
      <p>As for how he dealt with the painful split, Elsa noted: ‘You always find support in your family, and he’s joined at the hip with his brother, who has been there to give all the strength he needed.’</p>
