        <b>Aamir Khan who is shooting for his upcoming film, Laal Singh Chaddha in Chandigarh, visited a gurudwara to offer prayers while his co-star Kareena Kapoor Khan is back in the bay</b>
      </p>
      <p>The shoot for <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/aamir-khan">Aamir Khan</a> starrer <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/laal-singh-chaddha">Laal Singh Chaddha</a> is currently happening in Chandigarh. We also gave you <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/laal-singh-chaddha-after-kareena-kapoor-khan-aamir-khan-s-turbanator-look-leaked/5dc8ee2887fb571eff7e3a8f">a glimpse of hit look from the sets of the film</a> which was leaked online. However, his co-star and heroine <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/kareena-kapoor-khan">Kareena Kapoor Kapoor</a> returned <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/photos/photo-gallery/kareena-kapoor-returns-to-the-bay-sports-a-khadi-kurta-pyjama-like-a-boss/5dd678ed87fb571eff7e4392">to Mumbai yesterday</a>. Since his leading lady is at bay, Aamir has time to kill off and took some time from his busy schedule to do something holy and spiritual. Well, the Thugs Of Hindostan actor visited a gurudwara in the state where he was spotted seeking blessings from the god.</p>
      <p>In the pictures, Aamir is seen wearing a saffron turban along with the same colour stole around his neck while he is posing with some of the officials from the gurudwara. In another picture, he is seen offering prayers as he gets clicked. As Laal Singh Chaddha’s character is a Punjabi character, we wonder if it is related to his film or he actually went there to seek blessings. </p>
