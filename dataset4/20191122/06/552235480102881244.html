      <h1>Jim Goodwin urges St Mirren to make Paisley a fortress and build on home frugality</h1>
      <h2>Buddies boss knows side are entering a crucial period.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Jim Goodwin isn’t losing sleep at the thought of old Buddie Jack Ross raiding <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> to bolster his Hibs side.</p>
      <p>Not when the Irishman knows his best young talents are on the radar of other clubs anyway.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-under-21s-football-team">Scotland U21</a> star Kyle Magennis has been linked with his former boss who was this week unveiled as the new manager at Easter Road. Goalkeeper Vaclav Hladky is another who is attracting interest from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Goodwin</a>, whose side welcome <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> and Hibs to Paisley next Tuesday, said: “I don’t think Hibs at the moment have got to do a whole lot of recruitment.</p>

      <p>“There is a good group of players there but we have players Jack is familiar with.</p>
      <p>“We have some very good, talented players, who are catching the eye of a number of clubs.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to say they might not be looking but a lot of teams are.</p>
      <p>“Jack will do what he has to do in January. We have players he speaks well of and enjoyed working with.”</p>
      <p>Goodwin admits tomorrow’s home clash with Ross County is St Mirren’s biggest of the season as they look to claw their way off bottom spot.</p>
      <p>Despite their lowly status the Buddies have conceded just once in five home league games going into the match - and that was a stunning Borna Barisic free kick against Rangers.</p>

      <p>The problem has been at the other end although, ironically, just when they do notch a double against Hearts last time out the defence decide to cave in and ship five.</p>
      <p>Goodwin said: “The Hearts game seems like a lifetime ago now and we are hoping to redeem ourselves.</p>
      <p>“It was one of those days that everything Hearts got on target went in and that’s not like us. They had six attempts on target and scored five.</p>
      <p>“We have lost one goal at home in the league and that was a fantastic free-kick against Rangers. We are confident at home and enjoy playing there.</p>
      <p>“The fans have created a fantastic environment and are so positive.</p>

      <p>“It is important anyone coming to Paisley knows they won’t have an easy afternoon. We have to make sure we get in their faces, are hard to beat and be horrible to play against.</p>
      <p>“I want my team to be entertaining going forward but out of possession I want us to be difficult to play.</p>
      <p>“It is probably the most important game of our season so far.</p>
      <p>“They have a cushion on us but if we win it closes to three points with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>“There are six or seven teams who are in a league of our own, battling it out to be in the top six. I think Hibs will improve, they have a fantastic squad and Jack Ross is a great appointment.</p>
      <p>“Hearts are too good to be languishing at the bottom.</p>
      <p>“We know where we are, that’s not having the best squad or budget but we make the best of what we have. If we can continue with the organisation before the Hearts game, the guys up front are showing glimpses of clicking which is good.”</p>
