      <p>Old Hill Police Station, off Halesowen Road, will be up for auction at Villa Park, in Birmingham, next month.</p>
      <p>The eye-catching buildings – with some of the building dating back to Victorian times – are being sold on behalf of West Midlands Police.</p>
      <p>A guide price has been listed as £250,000+ – with bosses at Bond Wolfe Auctions expecting a lot of interest in the site.</p>
      <p>Ian Tudor, managing director of Bond Wolfe Auctions, said: "I have a longstanding working relationship with West Midlands Police and I am delighted to be instructed on this cracking opportunity.</p>
      <p>“This attractive freehold property measures approximately 6,803 square foot and comes with car parking for up to ten vehicles.</p>
      <p>“The buildings include a detached part two-storey, part single-storey ex-police station and a former magistrates court, with a range of offices, former interview rooms, former court room, stores, kitchen, toilets, plant and boiler rooms.</p>
      <p>“They are located with a prominent frontage to Halesowen Road at the junction with Court Street in a well-established area comprising a church, medical centre, religious hall, local shopping, offices and residential dwellings.”</p>
      <p>He added: "The former Old Hill Police Station and court could be considered suitable for a variety of alternative uses, subject to planning permission, and we expect strong interest from bidders on the day.”</p>
      <p>Old Hill Police station will be up for auction at Villa Park on Wednesday, December 11, from 10.30am.</p>
