      <p>The UEFA EURO 2020 play-off draw takes place at midday CET on Friday 22 November at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>The play-offs, in March 2020, consist of single-leg semi-finals and finals. They will decide the last four berths at UEFA EURO 2020, with the winners going to the EURO along with the top two from each of the ten qualifying groups.</p>
      <p>With the confirmation of the 20 teams directly qualified and the 16 teams qualified for the play-offs, UEFA is in a position to confirm that the procedures established for the play-off draw and the final draw can be fully executed.</p>
      <p>No additional draw will be required.</p>
