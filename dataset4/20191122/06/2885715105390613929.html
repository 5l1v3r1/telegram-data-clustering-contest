      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:24:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The war of words between the state government and Raj Bhavan continued unabated with Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar Thursday asking two state ministers to concentrate on their departments, instead of reacting to his statements “just to please their boss”.</p>
      <p>Taking jibe at Minister of State for Health Chandrima Bhattacharya and Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim, Dhankhar asked them to stop reacting to his statements. He said either Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> should herself react or depute a specific minister for the purpose.</p>
      <p>“All ministers should stop reacting to my statements just to please their boss (Banerjee). I have heard junior Health Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya reacting to my comments. I would request her to concentrate on her department as all of us are aware of its real condition,” Dhankhar told reporters after his morning walk at Rabindra Sarovar in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>The statement came a day after he was shown black flags allegedly by some Trinamool Congress workers on his way to Domkal in Murshidabad district to attend an event on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dhankhar said he had sought a helicopter from the state government to travel to Murshidabad, but there was no response.</p>
      <p>“Actually the state government wants to control my movement. But let me make it very clear that whatever I am doing, it is well within my constitutional limits. Others can’t dictate me,” Dhankhar had said.</p>
      <p>Bhattacharya had said what he is doing “doesn’t behove the Governor”. “The people of the state are angry, so a few may have protested against him.”</p>
      <p>Dhankhar claimed Banerjee has sanctioned such outbursts. “Ministers one after the other have orchestrated unpalatable outbursts in public domain about the Governor. I doubtlessly take all these have sanction of the the HCM and this is worrisome for me and others who believe in Democracy and Constitution,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Bhattacharya again hit back on Thursday: “People go for morning walks to stay healthy. Instead, he is encouraging negative thoughts and ideas. The Governor does not need to tell me how to look after my department. The Chief Ministeris entitled to do that.”</p>
      <p>“He is degrading the dignity of his constitutional chair by making these statements. Every day he is saying something against our government to create a rift. This does not suit a person holding such a constitutional post. “</p>
      <p>Later, the Governor took a dig at Hakim, who is also the Kolkata Mayor. “Firhad Hakim recently participated in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. I was happy to see that. But from Raj Bhawan to Rabindra Sarovar, the condition (of roads) told a different story. Let us not believe in tokenism,” said Dhankhar.</p>
      <p>Hakim responded, “He has come from a different state, so he is speaking from his experience.”</p>
