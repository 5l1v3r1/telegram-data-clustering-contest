      <p>Some brighter intervals will develop in the south this morning.</p>
      <p>Brightening up elsewhere this afternoon but further showers or spells of rain will continue to occur, with some heavy falls, especially over the eastern half of the country.</p>
      <p>Highs of 7C to 9C in light or moderate easterly breezes. Fresh at times on east and north coasts.</p>

        <b>TONIGHT</b>
