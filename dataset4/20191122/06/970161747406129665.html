      <p>Meals on wheels proved they were worth their weight in gold when they were unable to deliver food to a woman in her 70s who had got stuck in her bath.</p>
      <p>The unnamed woman went without food for over a week because she could not climb out of the tub at her home in Loughborough, Leicestershire.</p>
      <p>Dawn Jackson from Wiltshire Farm Foods was unable to get hold of her on the phone to deliver her meals so became concerned.</p>
      <p>They contacted police who broke in and discovered the woman, who was hungry, but otherwise fine, and told officers she had been there for eight days.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: ‘Officers managed to get her out and East Midlands Ambulance were called to carry out medical assessment. Although hungry she is okay.’</p>
      <p>Suzy Leeson, franchise owner of Wiltshire Farm Foods, said: ‘We couldn’t get in touch with her over the phone, which was unusual.</p>
      <p>‘One of our customer care assistants, Dawn Jackson, was becoming increasingly worried about her and was ringing every day.</p>

      <p>‘In the end she asked one of our drivers, Lenny, to go round to make sure she was okay. He found a pile of post and decided to call the police. They went round, broke in and found her.</p>
      <p>‘The police officer told us she had managed to keep warm with an electric fire. He said she was in hospital but amazingly she was okay.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t imagine how frightening it must have been for her to be unable to move. If Lenny hadn’t gone round she might still be stuck there.</p>
      <p>‘Our drivers do try to get to know our customers and look out for them where they can. I’m really pleased with how Lenny and Dawn went out of their way here.’</p>
      <p>The woman is now recovering in hospital.</p>
