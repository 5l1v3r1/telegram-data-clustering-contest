      <h1>'Arrogant' Gareth Bale subjected to angry live radio attack over flag celebration</h1>
      <h2>Producer of Jim White and Natalie Sawyer national radio show launches furious blast at Bale over those brilliant Wales celebrations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:27:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:27</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Abbandonato</a></address>
      <p>A national radio pundit today launched a furious tirade at Wales superstar Gareth Bale over those controversial flag celebrations.</p>
      <p>He called on Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane to punish Bale for holding up the 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In That Order' flag after the stunning 2-0 triumph over Hungary which sent Ryan Giggs' aces to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>In a further blast, Bale was told he should have thrown the flag away because he was disrespecting the club that pay his bumper wages with his Cardiff City Stadium antics.</p>
      <p>The on-air TalkSPORT comments, made on the Jim White and Natalie Sawyer show, follow a backlash in Spain where sports paper <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/gareth-bale-real-madrid-wales-17290946">Marca produced a front page condemning Bale</a> .</p>

      <p>However, Wales' players appear to be unperturbed by the row brewing around Bale. They joined him in joyously holding up the banner on the pitch and team-mates Joe Allen and Sam Vokes were then captured in the early hours singing the song with fans in Cardiff's famous Chippy Alley Caroline Street.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You can read about that story and watch the brilliant video <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jubilant-wales-stars-joe-allen-17291794">here</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>TalkSPORT waded into the debate on Thursday, with presenters White and Swayer briefly taking a backseat whilst their producer, who the radio station promote by the name of ProducerJoe on social media, waded into Bale.</p>
      <p>He hit out, starting: "Gareth knew exactly what he was doing. He must have seen it, he must have read what it said. He must have known how disrespectful that would be seen to the fans back in Madrid, the media back in Spain.</p>
      <p>"And he still chose to pose with that flag, jump up and down and celebrate with it.</p>
      <p>"I think he was misguided to do so because what he's done is disrespect the club that pays him 600k a week."</p>
      <p>He went on to claim: "He's not in their good books anyway, Zidane doesn't really like him. We don't know why Zidane doesn't like him, maybe he's got an attitude problem? I think this proves that perhaps he does have an attitude problem, perhaps he's a bit arrogant."</p>

      <p>Top presenter White intervened to say Bale wasn't the kind of individual to disrespect anybody, and also argued these were pro-Wales celebrations and nothing to do with Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>But his producer went on: "No, sorry Jim, you play for a club, you put your soul into playing for that club, otherwise you lose the fans.</p>
      <p>"If a player comes to my club I want to see them put everything into that club and not be posing with flags that disrespect the club he plays for, because that's exactly what he's done.</p>

      <p>"It was a dig at Real Madrid, it's a player disrespecting the club that pays his wages. That's what he was doing.</p>
      <p>"We know the issues he's got with Real Madrid. If he's got issues and tells his team-mates in private, that's fine. But remember he's going back to Madrid today, they've got Real Sociedad on Saturday, he's going to get booed.</p>
      <p>"If he plays. I don't think Zidane will play him after that. He should punishing him for disrespecting the football club that pays his wages.</p>
      <p>"Gareth Bale should have thrown away that flag and said 'No I'm not doing that because that's going to cause me trouble."</p>
