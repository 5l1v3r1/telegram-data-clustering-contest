      <p>Roger Daltrey is to have an operation to scrape his throat to check and remove pre-cancerous cells from his vocal cords.<br/><br/>The Who legend, 75, first noticed a problem with his voice in 2009 and was diagnosed with dysplasia - abnormal, precancerous cells in his throat.<br/><br/>He told British newspaper The Sun he is having an operation on Friday to ensure his voice is OK for a 2020 tour.<br/><br/>"I can't do much talking - I'm off for a voice op on Friday," he said.<br/><br/>The Who previously had to postpone several U.S. concerts in September after losing his voice.<br/><br/>Roger's doctor Rajiv Pandit says the operation, and regular checks and work, including laser treatment, helps stop the star getting cancer, as well as enabling him to perform.<br/><br/>"In Roger's case, his dysplasia left untreated would have not only ruined his singing career but could have turned into cancer," he explains.<br/><br/>The Who's U.K. tour gets under way in Manchester in March.</p>
