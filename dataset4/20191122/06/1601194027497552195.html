      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/anthony-smith">Anthony Smith</a> earned a title shot for the first time in his career and faced <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> 235. Given his "journeyman" tag, nobody considered him to be a serious threat or contender to Jones, and in the fight, the critics were unfortunately proved right.</p>
      <p>Smith was defeated in a lopsided unanimous decision and appeared to pose no threat to Jones, not taking many risks nor having a sound gameplan to defeat the dominant champion. He did, however, show a lot of toughness and refused to take a disqualification victory when hit with a knee to the head.</p>
      <p>He's since had a strong comeback and finished one of Jones' toughest opponents to date - Alexander Gustafsson. He's not in the mix for a title shot right now, but Corey Anderson is a man who is.</p>
      <p>Anderson, however, will be passed over and Jones has chosen Dominick Reyes as his next opponent instead. Anderson hasn't been happy about it and even Dana White criticized him for acting like a "cry baby". Anthony Smith called out Anderson after UFC 244 (who subsequently rejected his offer), but reiterated on <i><a href="https://twitter.com/MMAonSiriusXM/status/1191910929241382913">Sirius XM</a></i><i> </i>as to why he needs to fight him (H/T Credit <i><a href="https://www.mmanews.com/anthony-smith-unleashes-frustration-with-corey-anderson">MMA News</a></i>):</p>
      <blockquote>“Just put your head down, and beat the next guy, and don’t complain about it. And then, every once in a while, try to be a little bit exciting and stop talking shit about the guys that are doing it right."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“You want to talk s**t about me? I got a title shot. So instead of talking shit, maybe emulate what we do a little bit, try to get a goddamn finish, stop talking shit about the UFC, and just beat the next guy. It’s that simple."</blockquote>
      <p>He said that Anderson needs to beat him first to get the shot against Jones:</p>
      <blockquote>“I don’t understand this formula in his head, it’s like he’s doing brain surgery. It’s not that hard. I’m the next guy that you have to beat. It’s that simple.”</blockquote>

      <p>Has Corey Anderson earned a title shot or is he complaining too much as Smith said?</p>
