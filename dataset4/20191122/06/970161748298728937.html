      <p>A grime artist imprisoned and repeatedly raped four young women, a jury has been told.</p>
      <p>Andy Anokye, 32, who performs under the stage name Solo 45, denies 31 charges against him at Bristol Crown Court.</p>
      <p>The charges, relating to four complainants, include 22 counts of rape and five counts of false imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Anokye also denies two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Judge William Hart has told jurors that Anokye was a member of the grime collective Boy Better Know.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Christopher Quinlan QC said the musician had abused four women over a two-year period.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘The prosecution say that he imprisoned, assaulted, sexually violated and raped four women. He filmed, using his mobile phone, a great deal of what he did.</p>

      <p>‘You will hear from each of them during the course of this trial. Each suffered in similar ways at different times at the defendant’s hands.’</p>

      <p>Mr Quinlan said one of the women reported the abuse to friends and then to police.</p>
      <p>Anokye was arrested and his mobile phone and laptop were seized by officers, who contacted three other women.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said: ‘What they disclosed to police is reflected by the 31 charges. We allege that these charges reflect his conduct and his treatment of these four young women.</p>
      <p>‘He physically assaulted and falsely imprisoned them, held them against their will and he raped each of them repeatedly.</p>
      <p>‘He is a violent and controlling narcissist and a bully. He is a sadist who derives satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on his victims.’</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said Anokye will claim that any sexual activity between him and the women was consensual.</p>
      <p>The jury heard Anokye is a grime artist, with Mr Quinlan describing the genre as ‘dance music influenced by garage music’.</p>
      <p>He told the jury: ‘Artists of that genre include Skepta and Stormzy. Neither has anything to do with this case but you may hear reference to either or both of them during the evidence.’</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said Anokye became known to each of the complainants through their ‘knowledge and taste’ for grime music.</p>
      <p>His music, the lifestyle and perceived glamour associated with it may have attracted them to him, the court heard.</p>

      <p>The jury of five men and seven women have been told they will view some of the recordings made by Anokye.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said: ‘You may find it both unpleasant and upsetting. It is important evidence. We promise you that to show it is not gratuitous but necessary.’</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan alleged that Anokye was ‘turned on’ by his power over his victims and their fear of him.</p>
      <p>He said the musician waterboarded one woman, leaving her ‘petrified’ and claimed he had ‘hacked’ her phone.</p>
      <p>Anokye told the woman to put her hand in a sink full of water, then brought over a toaster that he plugged into a socket.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said: ‘The effect, if carried out, was to electrocute her. She was pulling away and crying. His reaction? It turned him on.’</p>
      <p>Police examining Anokye’s devices after his arrest discovered searches for ‘dacryphilia’ – sexual arousal from another’s fear.</p>
      <p>On one occasion, it is alleged he drove a woman to a secluded area and ordered her to remove anything that could identify her.</p>
      <p>Anokye is said to have told the woman that she would be shot, with the incident ending when she had a panic attack.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said: ‘He poured bleach in her mouth, he threatened to brand her with a hot iron. He made her call him by the name of another grime performer, Skepta.’</p>
      <p>Anokye, of Millennium Promenade, Bristol, denies all the charges against him and the trial continues.</p>
