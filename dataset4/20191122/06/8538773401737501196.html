      <h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo sets career mark with 15 assists vs. Blazers</h1>

      <p>MILWAUKEE -- Triple-doubles are nothing new for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>, but Thursday's stood out as the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/mil">Bucks</a> beat the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> 137-129.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo's 24 points and 19 rebounds were impressive, but his career-best 15 assists most caught the attention of coach <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1468/mike-budenholzer">Mike Budenholzer</a> on a night Antetokounmpo became the first Bucks player ever to have at least 20 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a game</p>
      <p>"I thought tonight was one of his best nights of just seeing the floor and really being a playmaker with 15 assists [and] in a lot of different ways he got the assists," Budenholzer said.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo clinched his second triple-double of the season with 6:43 left in third off a layup by Bucks guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934673/donte-divincenzo">Donte DiVincenzo</a>. Milwaukee went 15-of-26 off Antetokounmpo's passes, creating 37 points off his assists -- the most in any game in his career according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.</p>
      <p>While Antetokounmpo can score and rebound with the best of them, with 15 straight double-doubles, his 6.0 assists per game are also a personal best if he's able to maintain that throughout the season. Decision-making, in addition to shooting, is something he has challenged himself to improve upon following his MVP campaign.</p>

      <p>"That's what I tried to do, try to find my teammate," Antetokounmpo said. "My teammates were in the right spot. They were able to knock down shots."</p>
      <p>"I think guys are starting to move better without the ball and cut and screen," Budenholzer said. "I think there's been a little bit of improvement there and I think that's just going to make us hopefully harder to guard."</p>
      <p>Budenholzer has diversified the offense this season by using Antetokounmpo as a passer in different situations out of the point guard position, in the post and off pick-and-rolls. All of that was on display against the Bucks, which helped teammate <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4238/eric-bledsoe">Eric Bledsoe</a> go off for a team-high 30 points.</p>
      <p>DiVincenzo also added 16 points to extend his career-long streak of double-digit scoring to four games, while <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4032/wesley-matthews">Wesley Matthews</a> added 12 points.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo's 24-point, 19-rebound, 15-assist stat line has only been matched by <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4142/wilt-chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a>, Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird in league history, but his teammates also feel he's capable of joining Robertson in another category if that's what he wanted to do.</p>
      <p>"Just playing with him a lot more, you've got to be ready because [passes] could come at you without even knowing sometimes," Bledsoe said. "I think he could average a triple-double, honestly, especially if we make shots."</p>
      <p>Facing <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> in just his second game with the Trail Blazers brought back memories for Antetokounmpo, whose first career start in December 2013 came against Anthony and the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a>.</p>
      <p>"I remember that game like it was yesterday. It was the first game that my family came and watched, so I was really excited, I was trash talking, I was getting into Melo," Antetokounmpo said.</p>
      <p>Anthony ended Thursday's game with 18 points and seven rebounds, shooting 6-for-15.</p>
      <p>"This is my seventh year now and the 17th year of Melo ... time flies," Antetokounmpo said. "I'm excited I could go against him -- he's definitely an NBA player, definitely deserves to be on the team."</p>
      <p>The Bucks (12-3) are now riding a six-game winning streak, but even with all the current success, sometimes Antetokounmpo is reminded of the earlier years, like facing the Knicks, where life was much different for him in Milwaukee. Either way, he can't complain.</p>
      <p>"I remember the good ol' days my rookie year when I could just walk outta here," Antetokounmpo said jokingly to reporters before speaking to the media scrum.</p>
      <p>The latest career game was just another night at the office.</p>
