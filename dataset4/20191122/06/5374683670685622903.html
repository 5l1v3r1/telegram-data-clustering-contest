      <h2>Former New York City Mayor files paperwork to run for US president as a Democrat, but has not yet made final decision on presidential run.</h2>

      <p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed paperwork on Thursday with the Federal Election Commission to run for US president as a Democrat, <i>Reuters</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The filing allows Bloomberg to raise money in a bid for the White House, but an aide made clear that no final decision on whether he will run has been made.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/259961">previously announced in March</a> that he would not run for president in 2020, due to what he cited as the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, however, he <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271309">filed for the 2020 Democratic primary in Alabama</a>, signaling he feels the field of nearly 20 candidates is vulnerable. If he enters, he will likely forgo the early states where potential rivals have been visiting for months.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271462">A poll</a> released earlier this month suggested Bloomberg would defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election – in the popular vote at least – if he were to win the Democratic nomination, a new poll shows.</p>
      <p>According to the Morning Consult/Politico poll, if Bloomberg were to run as the Democratic nominee in 2020, he would win the popular vote by six points, 43% to 37%, with 21% of respondents unsure of who they would support.</p>
      <p>Trump has <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271343">downplayed Bloomberg’s presidential bid</a>.</p>
      <p>“Little Michael will fail,” he told reporters outside the White House. “There’s nobody I’d rather run against than Little Michael. I‘ve known Michael Bloomberg for a long time. He said a lot of great things about Trump. But I know Michael. He became just a nothing. He’s not going to do well, but I think he’s going to hurt [Joe] Biden, actually.”</p>
