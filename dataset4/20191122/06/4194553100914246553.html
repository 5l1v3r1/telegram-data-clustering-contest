      <p>Roberto Firmino – a man of many talents.</p>
      <p>A video has gone viral on Twitter that shows Roberto Firmino playing the piano in his home with his wife Larissa singing along.</p>
      <p>What’s more – they’re pretty good! Especially our Brazilian striker, who we had absolutely no idea possessed musical ability.</p>
      <p>Firmino has had some excellent games this term, but only found the net on three occasions. This isn’t his role, but it would be great if he could add a few more to his game – starting at Selhurst Park this Satirday!</p>
