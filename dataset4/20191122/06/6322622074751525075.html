      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): theedgemarkets.com highlighted 10 stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. Four stocks displayed positive momentum while six showed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>Stocks with positive momentum were:</p>
      <p>Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd — up 1.5 sen at 61.5 sen</p>
      <p>Matang Bhd — up 1 sen at 8 sen</p>
      <p>Thong Guan Industries Bhd — up 14 sen at RM3.56</p>
      <p>TSH Resources Bhd — up 4 sen at RM1.19</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>Chin Hin Group Bhd — up 2 sen at 91.5 sen</p>
      <p>Daibochi Bhd — up 6 sen at RM2.28</p>
      <p>Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd — up 16 sen at RM1.84</p>
      <p>IGB Bhd — up 33 sen at RM3.03</p>
      <p>Revenue Group Bhd — up 7 sen at RM1.83</p>
      <p>Rohas Tecnic Bhd — up 2.5 sen at 77.5 sen</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendations. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
