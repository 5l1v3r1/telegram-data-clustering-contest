      <h3>The Newcastle Street Circuit may only be into its third year, but it has already thrown a spanner in the works for drivers as they continue to grapple with the challenging layout and trying conditions.</h3>
      <p>Champion-elect <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/supercars-newcastle-newcastle-500-practice-1-results-timing-scott-mclaughlin-video/news-story/834ca95dac4ff54206ac3f924498a363">Scott McLaughlin pipped David Reynolds in the opening practice session</a>, but the blustery conditions even caught out the Shell V-Power Racing driver midway through the 30-minute hit out.</p>
      <p>The Turn 11 hairpin has been narrowed to enhance overtaking opportunities at the circuit, but even the most minor of re-profiling changes saw McLaughlin one of many to have a moment at the turn.</p>

      <p>Nick Percat’s crash at the Turn 7 left-hander proved the session’s flashpoint as the #8 Timken ZB Commodore nudged the barrier, leaving the car with cosmetic damage.</p>
      <p>Finding and pushing the limit is the key question when it comes to street circuits, and McLaughlin found that harder than most at the previous street event at Surfers Paradise, when <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/crashed-scott-mclaughlin-mustang-wont-race-again-after-gold-coast-shunt/news-story/b53db4be10a348054bc19128a845df9b">he was hospitalised following a major qualifying shunt that wrote off his Ford Mustang</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking after first practice at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500 on Friday, McLaughlin admitted his Holden rivals – primarily the Red Bull Holden squad vying for the teams’ title – may continue to find more pace as the weekend rolls on.</p>
      <p>“They’re strong at street circuits, most of them down pit lane [are],” he told the broadcast.</p>
      <p>“Their added features are going to help them under brakes and a few other things too. It’ll be interesting, the weekend. I’m feeling good, the car felt good.</p>
      <p>“The wind makes it bloody hard to drive, so I was blowing a fair bit.”</p>

      <p>However, when asked if he may reign in the aggression at another tough street circuit following his Gold Coast nightmare, he simply answered: “Two more races, man. Two more races to win.</p>
      <p>“The team and the supporters we have, I wanna go out there and do the best job I can.</p>
      <p>“I’m here to race and I’m here to win, I’m a race car driver and I’m paid to do that. If I didn’t do that, I wouldn’t be doing my job.”</p>
      <p>The track will continue to evolve across the weekend, and Kelly Racing drivers Rick Kelly and Andre Heimgartner – who finished 10th and 22nd respectively in the session – discussed the difficult nature of the circuit.</p>
      <p>“It’s certainly a track that requires full commitment, there’s no doubt about that,” Kelly said.</p>
      <p>“I think everyone’s already had a near miss or two with the concrete walls. It’s very difficult to piece a complete lap around here.”</p>
      <p>Heimgartner said: “We really struggled to get confidence in the car, whether we’re too stiff on the springs or stuff like that. At the moment, just having no confidence to bleed off the brake and turn and carry the speed.</p>
      <p>“The difference [at Turn 11] interrupts your flow a lot, before you could flow it in one arch, whereas now you’ve got to go down to first gear to get around there. It’ll be interesting for the racing.”</p>

      <p>IRWIN Racing’s Mark Winterbottom added: “Very tricky day here, very windy. Obviously with the beach, a lot of sand coming onto the track.</p>
      <p>“Two 30-minute sessions, so quite short. It’s a challenging day.”</p>
      <p>The second practice session saw tiny margins at the top, with <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/supercars-newcastle-newcastle-500-practice-2-results-timing-jamie-whincup/news-story/2b6271d5856229d937a03ad4d856e3b2">Jamie Whincup pipping Cameron Waters by just 0.0057s</a>.</p>
      <p>Waters said he was happy after suffering a car issue in Practice 1, but understands how the circuit can bite even if he managed to improve session on session.</p>
      <p>“There’s a little bit more in it, through [Turns] 5 to 9, if you get that first one wrong, it just carries on to the next, and the next, and the next,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“There’s still a bit in my lap, but everyone probably has the same story.”</p>
