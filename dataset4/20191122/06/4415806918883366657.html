      <h1>Gardaí continue to question four men in connection with Kevin Lunney abduction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:57:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Four men remain in Garda custody this morning in connection with the abduction and torture of Kevin Lunney.</p>
      <p>Three of the men were detained in Dublin yesterday, while another was arrested in Cavan.</p>
      <p>The vicious attack on Kevin Lunney in September this year left the Quinn Insurance Holdings director with life-changing injuries.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old was abducted outside his home in Derrylin, Co. Fermanagh, and found hours later on a roadside in Cavan, bleeding and freezing.</p>
      <p>He had a broken leg and had been slashed with a knife, doused with bleach and branded by the attackers.</p>
      <p>Yesterday four men - two aged 38, one aged 25 and another aged 66 - were arrested in Dublin and Cavan in connection with the investigation.</p>
      <p>The chief suspect, Cyril McGuinness, died during a police raid in the UK earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin's justice spokesperson, Martin Kenny, says there's a sense of relief that gardaí seem to be finally making progress in the investigation.</p>
      <p>Mr Kenny said: "This has been a long drawn-out saga going on for many years and many people in the public and the community in the border region have been very distressed by what has happened.</p>

      <p>"Having said that, I think there is a certain confidence coming back into it that finally the gardaí seem to be getting a handle on it."</p>
      <p>A total of seven people, including a mother and son, have so far been questioned in connection with the attack.</p>
