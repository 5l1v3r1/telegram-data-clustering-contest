      <p>The parents of British backpacker Grace Millane have broken down in court after seeing their daughter’s killer Jesse Kempson being found guilty of her murder.</p>
      <p>Grace was strangled by a man she met on Tinder and her body was found buried in a suitcase in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Before her death she had spent several hours drinking with him in the centre of Auckland on December 1, 2018.</p>
      <p>They went back to Kempson’s flat and Grace was killed either that night or in the early hours of the next morning – the date of her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>Kempson, 27, was found guilty by a jury of seven women and five men after five hours of deliberation at Auckland High Court.</p>

      <p>They heard that he had used Google to look up websites for large duffel bags, suitcases and car hire after Grace died.</p>

      <p>His phone included searches such as ‘flesh-eating birds’ and ‘are there vultures in New Zealand?’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/grace-millanes-killer-unmasked-creepy-fantasist-failed-salesman-11201228/">Kempson also looked online for ‘the hottest fire’</a>, ‘large bags near me’ and ‘Waitakere Ranges’.</p>
      <p>Grace’s parents, who sat in the public gallery since the start of the trial in November 4, broke down in tears as the guilty verdict was read out.</p>
      <p>Several jurors also cried while the killer stood emotionless, flanked by two corrections officers.</p>

      <p>Mr and Mrs Millane, who were accompanied throughout the hearing by Detective Scott Beard who led the search for their daughter, left the court holding hands.</p>
      <p>Mr Millane wept as he told reporters: ‘The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace.</p>

      <p>‘It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year. Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>‘Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever. She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way during her gap year.’</p>

      <p>The Crown successfully argued that Kempson, who had an order banning his identification in New Zealand, strangled her and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>She was assumed missing and her father, David Millane, flew to New Zealand as local authorities spent a week searching until her body was found by police.</p>
      <p>The defence had claimed the death was accidental and occurred during rough sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p>Justice Simon Moore told jury members before they delivered their verdict that they had to be certain Kempson had murderous intent when he put his hands on Ms Millane’s neck during sexual intercourse to convict him of murder, the New Zealand Herald reported.</p>
      <p>Mr Moore asked: ‘Are you sure that when he applied pressure to Ms Millane’s neck… Did he intend to cause injury?’</p>

      <p>He further asked them to consider if Kempson was willing to take the chance of Ms Millane dying due to his actions.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The judge said: ‘If yes, then (the defendant) is guilty of murder. In other words, (he) must have appreciated Ms Millane’s death was a likely consequence… but was willing to run that risk.’</p>
      <p>The court had been told Ms Millane had an interest in BDSM, with a previous sexual partner testifying they had used safe words and physical tapping to indicate when physical pressure became overwhelming.</p>
      <p>During the trial the jurors heard from forensic experts who examined Kempson’s flat for blood stains as well as Ms Millane’s body after her death.</p>

      <p>They were also shown footage of the woman and Kempson drinking at various bars throughout Auckland and kissing before they returned to his apartment.</p>
      <p>Video footage from the elevator of her exiting on the third floor marked the last recorded time Ms Millane was seen alive.</p>
      <p>Grace’s father acknowledged the efforts of New Zealand’s police, Det Insp Beard and thanked the prosecution team and the media.</p>
      <p>Mr Millane said: ‘Finally we want to thank the people of New Zealand. I can’t thank you enough for our your kindness and for opening your hearts to us.’</p>
      <p>Kempson will be sentenced on February 21, 2020, and faces life in prison with a minimum of 10 years without parole.</p>
