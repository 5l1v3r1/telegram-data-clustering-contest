      <p>Liverpool has moved forward with plans to extend Anfield’s capacity to about 60,000 by inviting local residents to attend public consultation events.</p>
      <p>The Premier League leaders hope to develop the stadium’s Anfield Road End in a bid to build on the current capacity of 54,074.</p>
      <p>Over 5,000 leaflets have been distributed outlining consultation events from 29 November to 4 December.</p>
      <p>Liverpool completed the expansion of Anfield’s Main Stand in 2016.</p>
      <p>The Main Stand development cost about £100m.</p>
      <p>Outline planning permission was also in place to redevelop the Anfield Road End of the ground.</p>
      <p>Those plans would have added a further 4,825 seats but in August the club chose to instead pursue “ambitious new plans”, prompting the consultation process.</p>
      <p>“The consultation events are designed for local residents, businesses and fans to learn more and offer their feedback on the club’s vision to create a bigger Anfield, which would allow more fans to watch some of Europe’s best football in a world-class facility,” the club said.</p>
      <p>A pop-up information stand will also be open on Anfield Road before the games against Brighton on 30 November and Everton on 4 December.</p>
