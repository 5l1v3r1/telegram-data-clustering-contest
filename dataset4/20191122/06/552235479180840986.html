      <h1>Scott Brown on the Leigh Griffiths Celtic regimen that will have striker in top form when he returns to the first team</h1>
      <h2>The Scotland international is battling back from injury an illness and scored in a reserve game this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Brown turned up at the Armadillo in Glasgow last night for the first time since he attended an Annie Lennox concert.</p>
      <p>He immediately burst into his own chorus of ‘Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This’ as he cast his thoughts towards a top team return for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> striker, approaching the 12 month mark of his initial break from top level football for mental health reasons, made a scoring return to action earlier this week.</p>
      <p>He netted a double in a 6-0 reserve team win over Stenhousemuir on Tuesday afternoon at Lennoxtown to offer a glimmer of hope there may finally be light at the end of the tunnel after a torturous year.</p>

      <p>His return would be good for the player first and foremost, but Celtic could also use his prowess on the front line as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> carries the burden of goalscoring in the absence of crocked Vakoun Issouf Bayo.</p>
      <p>Scotland? <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> could do with his goals as the national team prepares for the Euro 2020 play-offs at the end of March that could finally end our 22 year exodus from a major tournament.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Brown was in good form at the SEC campus at the launch of his new DVD and a sell-out Q and A with Hoops fans labelled ‘An Evening With Broony - Captain. Leader. Legend.’</p>
      <p>He said: “The last time I came to the Armadillo was to watch Annie Lennox in concert. I never realised how big it is.</p>
      <p>“It’s entertaining playing in front of 60,000 fans, but it’s a different kind of nerves answering questions in front of 3000.”</p>
      <p>Talk about walking on broken glass and, as for a Griffiths return, it’s less a question of ‘Why?’ as ‘Why not?’ although he called for expectations on his team-mate to be tempered with reality.</p>

      <p>He added: “Everyone knows how good a player Leigh is, but he needs to get back to the required fitness levels of the past.</p>
      <p>“He’s working hard in training and looking after himself. Everything’s going well for him and he knows that and as soon as he goes on the park and gets a chance, he’ll score a goal.</p>
      <p>“You always need one of those players in your team. He scored 100 goals for Celtic quicker than anyone else and that shows how well he’s done for us.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t seen too much of him in training this week because we’ve had the international break and he’s been in doing bits and bobs.</p>

      <p>“But he’s looking to get back to the fitness levels he showed before and he’s going to have to play those bounce games to make sure he finds his match fitness more than anything.</p>
      <p>“From there it is up to him and the manager how far he can push himself and if he can contend with Odsonne.</p>
      <p>“He wants to play for Celtic. It is hard for any professional footballer when you aren’t playing and you are injured, but he is dealing with it and he is coming back.</p>
      <p>“It is about trying to make sure he is in the best condition possible. He is in a good frame of mind just now and we need to make sure that once he is in training he is scoring those goals and working as hard as everybody else.</p>

      <p>“We need that whole play from him and that includes defending, working hard, closing down people - as well as scoring those goals.</p>
      <p>“Look, it is hard for anyone. There are people who have done cruciates and have been out for a long time and you know what it’s like when you come back.</p>
      <p>“In the first couple of games you are always a bit rusty. That is why he is trying to get as many bounce matches and reserve games in now, so he is not so rusty when he comes into the first team.</p>
      <p>“It would be a great boost for Celtic and also for Scotland. We need him fit as a fiddle and back to doing what he does best - scoring goals.”</p>
      <p>Celtic have a gruelling schedule of nine games over the month of December, including the Betfred Cup final against Rangers and high profile Premiership matches.</p>

      <p>Revenge is on their mind tomorrow when they entertain Livingston, who handed Neil Lennon’s side their only domestic defeat of the campaign with a shock 2-0 win at the Spaghettihad last month.</p>
      <p>Brown added: “We didn’t play that well that game. It was a hard start when Ryan Christie was sent off but we should still have played better, even with 10 men.</p>
      <p>“It’s all about how we bounce back. We don’t want too many dips because in Europe and domestically we have been very good. We must maintain those levels in the weeks ahead.”</p>
      <p>Ironically, in the most prestigious competition, the Europa League, Celtic could theoretically rest some of their top team stars after securing qualification for the last 32 with two games remaining following that stunning victory in Lazio.</p>
      <p>Of course, topping the group is also important as it will boost seeding for the knockout stage, but Brown is simply delighted to see his club make an impact on the big stage again.</p>

      <p>He said: “We’ve been in tough groups before, in the Champions League and Europa League. We have always struggled away from home.</p>
      <p>“The night in Rome was huge for us, especially as it was the club’s first win on Italian soil.</p>
      <p>“It was a proud moment for the manager, he was very emotional. After the game, he was on top of the world, as were all of the lads.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people wrote us off after having scored late to beat Lazio at home and thought we would go over there and just sit back.</p>
      <p>“Olivier Ntcham believes we can win the competition? No pressure, Olly! You take it one game at a time and we still have two group games to play.</p>
      <p>“We need to perform well and try to win the group and then we’ll see whether or not we get an exciting draw in the round of 32.”</p>
