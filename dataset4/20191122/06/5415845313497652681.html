      <h1>Arsenal: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang drama another sparkling turd</h1>
      <h2>It’s really annoying to be constantly let down by players that you thought were dedicated to the Arsenal cause. Enter Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s drama.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>You’d think that Unai Emery was really trying to replicate Arsene Wenger’s mistakes as well. Wenger handed the <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> captaincy to <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/3fcab3a8/Robin-van-Persie?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Robin van Persie</a>, likely in an attempt to keep him, only to see him jump ship for Manchester United. It left a sickening feeling that many probably aren’t over yet.</p>
      <p>After the fans secured the removal of <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/e61b8aee/Granit-Xhaka?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Granit Xhaka</a>‘s captaincy, Unai Emery bafflingly handed it to <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d5dd5f1f/Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, who has now reportedly put contract talks on hold as he hopes to secure a move to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Charming. Nothing beats having our superstars ditch us for “bigger” clubs. And if it happens again, then what progress have we really made. For that matter, have we learned a lesson?</p>
      <p>First off, the bright side—make some damn money off him. Like… some <i>damn</i> money. If we can do that, then ignore all my griping and groaning, I’m happy. I think we should sell him any way.</p>
      <p>But now we have the enjoyable path ahead of knowing that he’s waiting for a transfer, and knowing that he would rather play striker over winger, so Unai Emery is going to be up against it trying to keep Aubameyang motivated enough to stay the viable weapon that we need him to be. Ideally, that wouldn’t be a problem, but there has been obvious discontent from Aubameyang lately, and given how he left Borussia Dortmund, well, let’s just say that the potential is there for this to turn into a great big turd that Emery just can’t shine into gold.</p>
      <p>Emery is already having a hard time with man management, and I worry that some of the players don’t respect him. Aubameyang is one such player. And maybe that’s me adding color to a black and white picture without evidence, but his off the pitch activities are troublesome, and he’s ever been the kind of guy to bust his arse on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Playing on the wings is not going to tickle his fancy when he believes that he should be the starting striker at Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The last thing this club needed was more drama. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/16380240/Mesut-Ozil?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Mesut Ozil</a>, Granit Xhaka and <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/52611641/Lucas-Torreira?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Lucas Torreira</a> have been more than enough, but if our Golden Boot winner (and <i>captain</i>) turns around and adds a fourth, then Emery has no hope.</p>
