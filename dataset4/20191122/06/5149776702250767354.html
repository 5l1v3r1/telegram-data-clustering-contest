      <p>Two police officers have been commended for attempting to save the life of a father-of-four who was dragged across the ground by a car at the Forest Recreation Ground.</p>
      <p>PC David Myers and PC Spencer Pugh were the first on the scene after the incident was witnessed by tram staff on Tuesday, October 23 last year.</p>
      <p>Father-of-four <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/mum-omar-shafiq-describes-loss-3046437">Omar Shafiq</a>, 47, was hit by a Citroen C2 on the Park and Ride site and then dragged on the underside before being catapulted out of the back.</p>
      <p>He was taken to Queen's Medical Centre but was later declared dead at 1.46am from multiple chest injuries and bleeding.</p>
      <p>Response officer PC Myers, 41, said he has "never seen injuries that bad" in the 18 years he has been on the force.</p>

      <p>He said: "We turned up after the call came in from NET workers. We pulled up at the tram stop. It had happened in the middle of the Forest Rec.</p>
      <p>"We gave CPR for half an hour to 45 minutes with the paramedics. I have never seen anything that bad. It was catastrophic.</p>
      <p>PC Pugh, 40, who has also worked in the force for 18 years, added: "It had not crossed our minds what we were going to. I remember running across the car park with the first aid kit.</p>
      <p>"It was only as I was approaching that it dawned on me. There were people there who were hysterical and a chap on the floor.</p>
      <p>"It was horrendous. I have done this job a long time and that is clearly up there."</p>
      <p>Marius Caraleanu, who was 25 at the time, of Randal Gardens, Hyson Green, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/park-ride-death-crash-driver-3049950">pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving</a>.</p>
      <p>He was originally charged with Mr Shafiq's murder, which he denied. A trial began but it was stopped and he pleaded guilty to the new offence. The prosecution asked for the murder charge to lie on file.</p>

      <p>PC Myers said: "We tried everything we could to save him, with the hope and chance we got somewhere."</p>
      <p>He said from the onset the chances were extremely low due to the extent of the injuries.</p>
      <p>"We did chest compressions and as much as we could do. The injuries we could see were that bad, putting bandages on would not have worked.</p>
      <p>"At the back of your mind you are thinking 'this is not looking good' but if there is a minute chance we can get a pulse up we have to take it."</p>
      <p>PC Pugh added: "I needed to get this guy breathing again. The people around you are secondary.</p>
      <p>"We kept going until the paramedics arrived. They did say in the ambulance we did get some heart output and that CPR had been vital to give him any chance, but unfortunately it was unsurvivable injuries."</p>

      <p>PC Myers said his job while the cordon was put in place and the hunt for the suspect began was to travel with Mr Shafiq to Queen's Medical Centre.</p>
      <p>This was to protect the evidence to build up a true picture of what had happened.</p>
      <p>The court heard Mr Shafiq and his partner had earlier been at a flat with others where there was an argument.</p>
      <p>One man left with two mobile phones which belonged to the flat owner.</p>

      <p>They later all met up at the park and ride for the phones to be returned.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Caraleanu was taking a prostitute to her car to collect some belongings.</p>
      <p>The court did not hear about any connection between the defendant and the people in the car park.</p>
      <p>Caraleanu's barrister, Martin Heslop QC, claimed his client's car was then attacked.</p>
      <p>Caraleanu drove at speed towards the man who was there to drop off the phones, stopped abruptly and got out and chased him.</p>
      <p>Mr Heslop said his client accepted his car caused the death - but insisted he never intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to anybody.</p>
      <p>He was jailed for 10 years and eight months in July this year.</p>

      <p>PC Myers and his colleague PC Pugh were commended for their actions on that horrific night at the Nottinghamshire Police Awards, held on November 21.</p>
      <p>PC Myers said: "You just see it as your job. We are pleased we have been commended.</p>
      <p>"It is ironic that we are being commended on what was a failure.</p>
      <p>"If we could have brought him back to life people would be saying 'what a great job we did.'</p>
      <p>"But we are being commended because we did everything we could have done."</p>
