      <h3>RACE 1 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(4) WHAT A PRINCE</b> showed promise on his local debut and looks the one to beat.</p>
      <p><b>(1) FREEZING FAST</b> is holding his form and should contest the finish yet again.</p>
      <p><b>(2) COVE FORT</b> has been a disappointment but tired only late last time out and could finish in the money.</p>
      <p><b>(3) DADS ROOTS </b>did not show much on his local debut but could improve trying the Polytrack.</p>
      <h3>RACE 2 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(4) GOOD TIMES ROLL</b> did well on her local debut which was on the turf. She disappointed when only fifth on the Polytrack on Monday but can bounce back and win in this weak field.</p>
      <p><b>(1) BABA YAGA </b>has improved with each run. She was fourth on over the course and distance. She should fight out the finish.</p>
      <p><b>(5) CABALLE</b> is better than her last run would suggest and has a place chance.</p>
      <h3>RACE 3 (1,300M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) GO GOODFELLOW</b> was a well-backed debut winner. He disappointed in his comeback run but could improve trying the Polytrack.</p>
      <p><b>(2) MTAKATYI</b> bounced back to win his latest start. It was his second win over the course and distance, so he must be given respect.</p>
      <p><b>(3) TOASTMASTER</b> is holding form and should contest the finish again.</p>
      <p><b>(8) BURNT ROCK</b> is in good form and should fight out the finish.</p>
      <h3>RACE 4 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(7) LUNCHPARK</b> is improving and does have a winning chance.</p>
      <p><b>(4) GINA'S GIRL</b> showed good improvement last start and can go on better this time.</p>
      <p><b>(1) ELUSIVE GREEN</b> continues to hold her form. She is battling to win but does have a chance in this line-up.</p>
      <p><b>(2) FASHION FORCE</b> is also battling to shed her maiden tag but is clearly not out of it.</p>
      <h3>RACE 5 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(3) MISS SPARTY PANTS </b>returns from a break and is a decent mare who can go close to winning. She has won on this surface.</p>
      <p><b>(1) MADAME SPEAKER</b> returned to form with a bang last time out. She will fight out the finish again.</p>
      <p>Stablemate <b>(2) DELIA'S DELIGHT</b> has done pretty well for her trainer and is not out of it.</p>
      <p><b>(4) RINGS AND THINGS</b> has won over the course and distance in July.</p>
      <h3>RACE 6 (1,900M)</h3>
      <p><b>(9) PALO ALTO</b> can win.</p>
      <p><b>(2) ONTENDERHOOKS</b> is capable of an upset.</p>
      <p><b>(5) SEATTLE SWING</b> is holding form and could finish in the money.</p>
      <p><b>(6) ARANJUEZ </b>is battling to regain his best form but is course-and-distance suited.</p>
      <p><b>(7) JAY'S HAWK</b> is battling to regain winning form but could place.</p>
      <p><b>(8) FOOLS GARDEN</b> is consistent and is not out of it.</p>
      <h3>RACE 7 (1,900M)</h3>
      <p><b>(2) WOOD FOR THE TREES</b> has some consistent recent form and has a winning chance.</p>
      <p><b>(5) SAMAR</b> has some good recent form and has a big winning chance.</p>
      <p><b>(6) WHITELEAF HILLS</b> is course-and-distance suited and can go close.</p>
      <p><b>(1) TITUS</b> is battling to win but could finish in the money again.</p>
      <p><b>(4) BENEVOLENCE</b> was not disgraced over this course and distance last time out and could play a minor role.</p>
      <h3>RACE 8 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) BELL TOWER</b> is in good heart and does have a winning chance.</p>
      <p><b>(2) MISS JACKSONVILLE</b> is better than her last run and could go close in this line-up.</p>
      <p><b>(3) MISTRESS OF MEANS</b> was outclassed in a decent field last time out and could bounce back to win a race like this.</p>
      <p><b>(6) VIVA LE BLEU</b> is holding form and is not out of it.</p>
      <p><b>(8) OASIS QUEEN</b> has been unreliable but does have a winning chance.</p>
