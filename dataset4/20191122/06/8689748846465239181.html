      <p>Shatta Wale has lost his cool on journalists and bloggers who continue to discredit him on the back of the trending Grammy Awards nomination.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/shatta-wale-has-not-been-nominated-for-grammys-blogger-clarifies/">It emerged yesterday that blogger and radio presenter NYDJ</a> said he personally sent an email to the organisers of the Grammys for clarification on the Shatta Wale Grammy Award brouhaha and reply was sent to him to that effect.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“According to a mail received from the Grammy Awards, only Artists who have worked on over 51% playing time of the pop vocal album would be nominees.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Any featured artist with less than 51% would not be a nominee. That settles it. Shatta Wale is not a Grammy Nominee.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The issue has generated a lot of debate on social media and as we know, SM fans are not happy with the attitude of Ghanaian journalists for this propaganda.</p>
      <p>The issue has attracted the attention of Shatta Wale and it has annoyed him to the core.</p>
      <p>He responded in a Snapchat saying: “So <b>Shatta Wale doesn’t deserve the best erh? your mother waa!!</b></p>
