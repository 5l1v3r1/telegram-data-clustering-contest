        <b>Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been offered a six-month deal to come to the aid of his former club AC Milan, according to reports in Italy yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US-owned club want the 38-year-old for six months and are prepared to pay him six million euros (S$9 million) if he stays for 18 months, reported Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
      <p>Milan, who finished fifth last season, are languishing at 14th on the Serie A table after 12 games.</p>

      <h3>Bale criticised for disrespecting Real Madrid</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Gareth Bale has been heavily criticised by the Spanish media for celebrating Wales' Euro 2020 qualification by holding up a flag that appeared to indicate his passion to play for Real Madrid is way down the pecking order.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bale had posed with a giant flag that read "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order", following Wales' 2-0 victory over Hungary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sports daily Marca's front-page headline yesterday read "Disrespectful. Misguided. Ungrateful. In that order", while AS newspaper captioned a picture of him playing golf with "Bale gets in a hole". - REUTERS</p>
      <h3>Novak Djokovic sends Serbia through to Davis Cup quarter-finals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Novak Djokovic booked Serbia's place in the Davis Cup quarter-finals last night as he eased past Benoit Paire to send France crashing out.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Djokovic beat Paire 6-3, 6-3 in Madrid, after Filip Krajinovic pipped Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) to give Serbia a 2-0 advantage with only the doubles rubber left.</p>
      <p>It means France cannot advance as one of the best two runners-up by virtue of their record on sets, even if they win the doubles.</p>
      <p>Serbia will meet Russia today. The others who have reached the last eight are Argentina, Canada, Germany, Spain and Australia. - AFP</p>
