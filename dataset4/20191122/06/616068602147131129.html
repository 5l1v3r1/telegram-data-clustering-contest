      <p>If you want to test your marriage and your Tesla, this may be the way to do it. </p>
      <p>A husband recently tested his Tesla by driving at speed toward his wife in autonomous mode to see if it would stop in time as she crossed the road. </p>
      <p>At 30 km-h, the car stopped just before killing his wife. She perhaps was drawing up the divorce papers a the same time.</p>
      <p>Mind you that could have been the next time when they tried again but at 20 km-h and this time the Tesla did not even attempt to brake. Thankfully, the dutiful husband covered the brakes and missed his wife.</p>
      <p>Later, the husband claimed the reason for the supposed error on the Tesla on the slower test was because his wife was walking too slowly.</p>
      <p>I’m sure the divorce papers are now filed.</p>
      <p>All the posted videos of the event have been blocked since articles started to share the video of a husband almost killing his wife.</p>
      <p>Of course, it goes without saying (or maybe none in this day and age) that you should not try this — stupid idea. </p>
      <p>It goes to show how early we are on the curve of suggesting that autonomous vehicles are right around the corner, which will likely appear about as quickly as eVTOLS (electric vertical take-off and landing). </p>
      <p>Interestingly, the Malaysian Civil Aviation Authority took steps today to cancel a planned attempt to demonstrate Malaysia’s eVTOL product because the company had no authority to do so, not even attempting to obtain the correct permits.</p>
      <p>It is the first of many push backs from global aviation regulators as disruptive entrepreneurs misunderstand the requirement to follow aviation regulations in development of their products. </p>
      <p>How do you know what is real and what is not in our fast cycled news media? Do the research and think critically.</p>
