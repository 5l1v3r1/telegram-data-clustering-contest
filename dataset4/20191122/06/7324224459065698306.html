      <h1>Bournemouth v Wolves: Nuno &amp; Co bid to pick up where they left off</h1>
      <h2>On the back of the international break – where a few got to rest – it is back to the grind for Wolves.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:06:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Tomorrow’s trip to Dorset to take on Bournemouth is the first of 10 games before the end of the year for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, <b>writes Joe Edwards.</b></p>
      <p>They have played 24 games in all competitions so far, and things are not going to let up any time soon.</p>
      <p>But Nuno &amp; Co are not going into this clash with Eddie Howe’s charges feeling weary.</p>
      <p>They are heading into it with a great deal of confidence – and a continued desire to get better.</p>
      <p>“There’s more to come from everybody,” said Nuno. “There’s more to come. We still have a lot of space for improvement.”</p>
      <p>You cannot help but feel encouraged by those words as Wolves have been doing very well over the past several weeks.</p>
      <p>They are on a seven-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and players all over the pitch have shone.</p>
      <p>Raul Jimenez just cannot stop scoring, Adama Traore has been tearing defences apart with his speed and skill, Rui Patricio has been a safe pair of hands, Ruben Neves has started making an impact in the final third again, Leander Dendoncker has seamlessly slotted into defence. You could go on for ages.</p>
      <p>Nuno has gone back to the 3-4-3 and things have clicked.</p>
      <p>A little more ruthlessness in front of goal would not go amiss but, on the whole, things have been going swimmingly.</p>
      <p>Romain Saiss is another player who has done a stellar job recently, filling in on the left side of defence in the absence of injured stopper Willy Boly – and looking so assured.</p>
      <p>The Moroccan is one of a large group – Jimenez, Patricio, Neves, Dendoncker, Matt Doherty, Joao Moutinho, Diogo Jota and Patrick Cutrone the others – who have just been away with their countries.</p>
      <p>Pedro Neto and Ruben Vinagre went away with Portugal Under-21s too, but pulled out with slight knocks.</p>
      <p>Saiss, though, is embracing the challenge of playing so many matches.</p>
      <p>After Bournemouth, Wolves travel to Braga to face them in the Europa League next Thursday, before facing Sheffield United at home on the Sunday.</p>
      <p>And Saiss cannot wait for all those tests. After all, it is better than training.</p>

      <p>“We have a lot of games now, but we play football for these kinds of games and it is better than training,” said Saiss.</p>
      <p>“We are ready for it, we work a lot with the coach and with the physical trainers to be ready.</p>
      <p>“We have to prepare well for all competitions, it is tough because we have a lot of games, but it is a good thing.”</p>
      <p>Bournemouth come into the encounter after beating Manchester United the last time out on home soil – before losing 2-1 at Newcastle.</p>
      <p>They are on the same amount of points as Wolves – 16.</p>
      <p>Nuno’s charges are eighth with a goal difference of one, and Howe’s ninth with a goal difference of zero.</p>
      <p>Ryan Fraser is expected to feature for the Cherries despite a knee knock.</p>
      <p>Josh King, though, is set to to miss out with a hamstring strain.</p>
      <p>David Brooks, Andrew Surman, Charlie Daniels and Junior Stanislas will not be involved either because of injury.</p>
      <p>Traore is thought to be recovering well from a hamstring problem picked up in the win against former club Villa, which saw him pull out of Spain duty – on the back of his first call-up, after interest from Mali too.</p>
      <p>Nuno will also be running the rule over Morgan Gibbs-White, who has missed the last few games with a back issue, and assessing Portuguese pair Neto and Vinagre after their early returns to Compton.</p>

        <b>Wolves likely line-up: Patricio; Dendoncker, Coady, Saiss; Doherty, Moutinho, Neves, Otto; Traore, Jimenez, Jota</b>
