      <p><b>The whistleblowing policy</b> of the Nigerian Government has recouped N594.09 billion since its implementation in 2016.</p>
      <p><b>According to <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/11/21/fg-saves-n594bn-from-whistleblower-policy/">This Day</a></b>, the Permanent Secretary, Special Duties, Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Muhammed Dikwa, while speaking at a workshop on the overview of the whistleblowing policy in Nigeria with the theme, “Implementation of the whistleblowing policy in Nigeria: Issues, Challenges and Way forward”, disclosed that the policy, which is a globally acceptable standard, would continue to exist and serve Nigeria.</p>
      <p><b>Dr Dikwa </b>disclosed that whistleblowing policy was established to fight corruption, and other financial crimes, including the violation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA); elimination of ghost workers syndrome; staff collecting double salaries in more than one organization, ministries, departments or agencies (MDAs) and retirees without proper records but still collecting salaries.</p>

      <p><b>However, the Permanent Secretary</b> stated that in order to show commitment to the elimination of over blotted cost of governance, wastages and leakages in government, there is a need for the legislation of the policy by the Federal Government.</p>
      <p><b>Dr Dikwa urged for the people</b> in charge of putting together the whistleblowing and witness protection bill 2019, to finish up and forward to the National assembly for ratification in order to provide a legal backing/administrative guide for the policy.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Meanwhile, according to Dr Dikwa</b>, though the policy has reportedly helped reduced corruption in both civil and criminal cases, it faces numerous problems which include lack of proper legal framework, poor funding, lack of coordination and diverse information among relevant organizations, not following the proper channel to give information, and fake information.</p>
      <p><b>Dikwa stated that</b> the whistleblowing policy, which is a work in progress has come to stay. He urged stakeholders to work assiduously towards legalizing and institutionalizing the policy to meet international best practices which other comity of nations have adopted over the years.</p>
