        <b>The Republic's rail network continued to improve in the first nine months of 2019, with train-km between delays breaching the one million mark.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the whole, in the first three quarters of this year, the MRT system clocked 1.08 million train-km between delays of more than five minutes. This is up from the 955,000 train-km seen in the first six months of 2019.</p>
      <p>The latest 12-month moving average from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) showed the oldest line - which was extensively renewed in recent years - posting the best results.</p>
      <p>The three-decade-old North South Line clocked more than 1.43 million train-km between delays, down slightly from 1.44 million train-km in the first six months.</p>
      <p>The runner-up was the North East Line (NEL) with 1.38 million train-km between delays, down drastically from 4.14 million train-km in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Straits Times understands that because the NEL is a shorter line, even a single incident affects its performance.</p>
      <p>The East West Line was third with 1.05 million train-km covered between delays, up significantly from 693,000 train-km. Newer lines - Circle and Downtown - came in with 900,000 plus train-km between delays.</p>
      <p>The Circle Line showed an improvement from 606,000 train-km at the six-month mark, while the Downtown Line slipped from 1.15 million train-km.</p>
      <p>Three major delays occurred on the entire rail network in the first three quarters, compared with nine for the whole of last year.</p>
      <p>The LRT network clocked 128,000 car-km between delays, a dip from 130,000 car-km seen in the first half.</p>
      <p>Singapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said that while the mean-kilometre before failure (MKBF) is an accepted measure of reliability, Singapore could look at more holistic measures.</p>
      <p>"There are some internationally measured indicators of reliability beyond MKBF, such as delay-minutes. Those could be useful because they capture the human impact of disruptions and are scaled according to how many peoples journeys they affect and for how long," he said.</p>
      <p>"In the local context, train crowding and having to wait for the next train are service quality issues that people feel strongly about."</p>
