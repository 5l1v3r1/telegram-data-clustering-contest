      <h1>Barry Ferguson makes Rangers prediction for title race with Celtic</h1>
      <h2>Barry doesn't feel either side will ease up with all the quality and depth of squad on show.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/barry-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>I’m not claiming to have a crystal ball.</p>
      <p>But then again you don’t need to be Mystic Meg to see into the future where <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and Celtic are concerned right now.</p>
      <p>Between them they’re about to face a total of 13 league games before they take on one another in the New Year’s derby on December 29. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> will play seven times, Rangers six.</p>
      <p>And I’m prepared to put my neck on the line right now and say there’s a high probability that neither of them will drop a single point between now and then.</p>
      <p>Look, I might be wrong - there may be a slip up along the way - but the truth of the matter is they look way too strong for all of the rest and I honestly can’t see anything other than maximum points for them both because they also realise they are entering the heart of the battle for this season’s title.</p>

      <p>If the pressure was off or if they thought they might be able to take the foot off the gas then perhaps it would be different. But when you are going at it hammer and tong knowing there is no room for error then it brings your consistency to another level.</p>
      <p>And that’s what we’re seeing from both of them over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>Celtic have just three away trips over that period at Ross County, Hearts and St Mirren.</p>
      <p>Rangers must go to Hamilton, Aberdeen, Motherwell and Hibs before they face the journey across the city at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>And in between all of that they’ve got two more Europa League ties each as well as the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> Final showdown at Hampden.</p>
      <p>It’s a hectic schedule but you are no looking at two sides with all the quality, depth of squad and motivation to keep on winning one football match after the next.</p>
      <p>Put it this way, I don’t even have the slightest concern about Sunday’s trip to Hamilton and that in itself shows how far this team has come under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>.</p>
      <p>This time a year ago you’d look at this fixture as a potential banana skin. A difficult trip to play on a plastic pitch against a side that won’t allow them a minute’s peace. And more often not it would turn out to be a struggle right enough.</p>

      <p>But, without counting any chickens here, I just don’t feel the same way any more. There is not even that slight bit of doubt at the back of my mind because this Rangers team is a different animal now. These players are in a really good place and, most importantly, they believe in themselves in a way they didn’t before.</p>
      <p>They know they’re going to go to Hamilton and take three points. Yes, of course Accies will make it difficult for them but the result is no longer in doubt the way it used to be.</p>
      <p>And it’ll be the exact same tomorrow at Celtic Park when Livingston come calling. Again, Gary Holt and his players are not going there to lie down but in the end we all know what the outcome is going to be. Another Celtic win.</p>
      <p>The good news is there’s so much for the fans to look forward to now that international football can be locked away until next March. It has felt lately as if Scotland have just been getting in everybody’s way and, speaking as a guy who was so proud to captain my country, I must admit I find that a sad state of affairs.</p>
      <p>The thing that jumped out at me on Tuesday night was that there were only 19,500 people there. Where have they all gone?</p>
      <p>We have a new manager who is trying to build something and who went to Cyprus on Saturday and got a result.</p>
      <p>Yes, I can already hear people reading this and saying ‘Calm down Barry, It’s only Cyprus’ but it was a win – and when you’re in our shoes that’s all that matters.</p>

      <p>Was it a great performance? No. Have we suddenly become world beaters because we’ve managed three successive victories over San Marino, Cyprus and Kazakhstan? Don’t be so silly.</p>
      <p>But at least we are making progress. Don’t forget at the start of this group Kazakhstan battered us 3-0 on their home ground so you have to give Steve Clarke some credit for the work he has done in a short space of time.</p>
      <p>We’re not the finished article - not by a long shot - but at least it’s a start. And the Scotland fans should be getting behind him because the guy needs time and he needs support.</p>
      <p>They have to realise he can’t change things overnight. He’s only getting a few days at a time to work with the players and to get his ideas across. It’s not like it was at Kilmarnock where he could get them out onto a training pitch as often as he wanted until the message had been well and truly drummed home.</p>
      <p>But, even so, if you can’t see the signs that it’s starting to come together for him then I’m sorry but you’re just not looking hard enough.</p>

      <p>Over these last three games Clarke’s Scotland really has started to take shape and the most obvious example of that is the new, advanced role he has given to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a>. I always knew he was a good player in his time at St Mirren and then Hibs.</p>
      <p>But right now? That boy is turning himself into a superstar. He is without question the main player in that Scotland team. The fact that he has scored seven goals in his last six internationals shows just how important he has become.</p>
      <p>And you have to hand it to Clarke too for taking him out of central midfield - where he had been guilty of giving the ball away too easily - and telling him to do his work forty yards up the pitch.</p>
      <p>So now we have a group of players including the likes of Callum McGregor, James Forrest, Ryan Christie, Ryan Jack, Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney. But McGinn is probably the most important of the lot which really is paying him a huge compliment.</p>
      <p>If that’s not enough to get Scotland’s fans excited looking forward to next March again then I don’t know what will. But for the meantime, we’ve all got other matters on our minds.</p>
