      <p>Chris Paul had to bite his tongue when asked Thursday about the coach’s challenge.</p>
      <p>“It needs a lot of work,” Paul said. “I don’t even know if I can say that because I’m on the Competition Committee. But one of the things I wish is that if you challenge it, you at least get to keep your timeout. I don’t think that makes a lot of sense. I know that the committee is working through things and trying to see how it goes.”</p>
      <p>If a coach wants to challenge a play, they must call for a timeout and immediately signal for a challenge. Only if the challenge is successful does the team get the timeout back.</p>
      <p>OKC was on the wrong end of Doc Rivers’ successful challenge Monday night in Los Angeles. A reach-in foul that would’ve sent Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari to the free throw line with 7.3 seconds left was overturned.</p>
      <p>Two free throws would have put the Thunder ahead.</p>
      <p>Foul calls have only been overturned 34% of the time. Challenges overall have a 38% success rate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Holiday assist</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamidou Diallo handed over a bag overflowing with canned fruits and vegetables, and cornbread and cake mixes.“It’s a little heavy,” he warned.</p>
      <p>To his left, Thunder teammate Andre Roberson placed turkeys into shopping carts and thankful arms. One child asked Roberson how tall he is.</p>
      <p>“How short are you?” Roberson responded with a teasing smile. “Never thought about that, huh?”</p>
      <p>Roberson and Diallo helped distribute 400 Thanksgiving meals Thursday afternoon to families in need. The event was held in northeast Oklahoma City at Restore OKC, an organization that seeks to see reconciliation in communities that have been marked by injustice and division.</p>
      <p>“Growing up, I didn’t have things like this around my community,” Diallo said. “For us to come into cities like this and be able to give back to those people that are a little bit less fortunate, the same as I was when I was growing up, it’s honestly a blessing. It’s great to see them. It’s great to put smiles on their faces.”</p>
      <p>The event, in partnership with Homeland, was part of the Thunder’s 12th annual Holiday Assist tradition.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Injury update</b>
      </p>
      <p>Diallo participated without restrictions in a contact practice Thursday, coach Billy Donovan said. Diallo (left knee sprain) has missed OKC’s last three games.</p>
      <p>Roberson (left knee injury recovery) participated in contact practices earlier this season, but not on Thursday. He hasn’t played in a competitive game since January 2018.</p>
      <p>“He’s really not quite all the way there from a comfort standpoint,” Donovan said. “I think that’s what he’s trying to work towards.”</p>
      <p>Donovan was asked last week if Roberson will play this season.</p>
      <p>“We’re hopeful,” Donovan said. “He’s a lot better off today than last year at this point. Where that leads and how far away from playing is he? It’s just too hard for me to say.”</p>
