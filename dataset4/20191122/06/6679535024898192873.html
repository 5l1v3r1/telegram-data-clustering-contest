      <p>Macha Gharibian Trio</p>
      <p>November 22 and 23, 9.30 pm onwards</p>
      <p>Windmills Craftworks, Whitefield</p>
      <p>Entry: ₹500 (standing), ₹1,000 (sitting), via windmillscraftworks.com</p>
      <p>Singer, pianist and composer Macha Gharibian is of Armenian origin, but shuttles between New York and Paris as a jazz artist extraordinaire. A classically trained pianist, who has composed for both theatre and film, Gharibian’s work is informed by wandering — whether it is honing Armenian folk songs or crossing over to jazz fusion. Currently on a tour throughout the country, the artist will perform a trio set on two nights in Bangalore’s Windmills Craftworks. Her trio includes drummer Dré Pallemaerts and guitarist David Potaux-Razel. Albums such as <i>Mars </i>and <i>Trans Extended </i>take listeners into new sonic terrain, even as Gharibian retains a bit of the typically French style of jazz, plus the experimental nature embedded in all New York artistes.</p>

      <p>Mumbai-based, Kolkata-bred vocalist and fusion artist Isheeta Chakrvarty will perform an hour long set in Bengaluru this week, amidst the intimate setting provided by Atta Galatta bookstore. Chakrvarty, who has performed at festivals in Spain, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and Mexico over the last five years, recently released her tribute to qawwali legend Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. On ‘Mustt Mustt’, Chakrvarty — along with a string section and a jazz band — performs a rousing version of ‘Dam Mast Mast’. From qawwalis, thumris to modern jazz and pop, Chakrvarty brings together worlds both traditional and modern to create a seamless fusion, featuring pianist-keyboardist Niranjan Joshi and guitarist-bassist Raghuraman Ramasubramanian.</p>
