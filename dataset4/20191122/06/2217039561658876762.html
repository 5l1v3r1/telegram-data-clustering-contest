        <b>At seven, Lim Rui Ze lost the ability to speak, walk and write after under going a surgery to remove a cancerous brain tumour.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He had an medulloblastoma, and it took months before he learnt how to hold a pencil again with the help of physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</p>
      <p>Lessons at the Children's Cancer Foundation learning centre - Place for Academic Learning and Support - helped keep Rui Ze on track with his peers.</p>
      <p>But three sentences were all the Tao Nan School pupil could manage during an English composition examination when he returned to school 15 months later as a Primary 3 pupil.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Rui Ze, now 12, collected his Primary School Leaving Examination results.</p>
      <p>The New Paper understands that he is able to progress to secondary school.</p>
      <p>His mother, Madam Shereen Wong, 41, quit her job as a teacher to take care of him.</p>
      <p>When he was in Primary 3 and 4, she attended lessons with him and took notes so that he could focus in class. During recess, she would sit with Rui Ze in a meeting room to help him eat.</p>
      <p>His teachers would roster two classmates at a time to spend recess with him as they were worried he would feel left out.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media at Tao Nan School in Marine Crescent, Rui Ze's father, Mr Lim Wei Hong, 41, said his son was allowed to use a computer for two PSLE papers - English and science.</p>
      <p>The general manager said: "When he started writing again, it took him a while to learn how to write in between the lines. But he has improved a lot now. He may need extra time and help, but I am very proud of him."</p>
      <p>Another student who received his results yesterday was Tejas Changaroth, 12, from St Gabriel's Primary School.</p>
      <p>When The New Paper arrived at the school, he was beaming.</p>
      <p>Eligible for the Normal (Academic) course, his results will be a ticket to pursue his dream as a broadcast journalist.</p>
      <p>Tejas had been accepted by Holy Innocents' High School through Direct School Admission via its niche area of broadcast and journalism.</p>
      <p>When he was nine, he was diagnosed with a developmental disorder of the brain, dyspraxia, at the severe scale.</p>
      <p>Tejas struggled with motor skills and coordination, sometimes unable to tell between basic directions.</p>
      <p>Mathematics, said his mother Shyamala Menon, was Tejas' greatest challenge.</p>
      <p>The speech and drama teacher, 50, told TNP: "Long equations are the hardest. He gets lost along the multiple steps. His classmates would have moved on but he would still be lagging behind."</p>
      <p>Tejas' teachers advised him to take the subject at the Foundation level, for which he got a grade three, meaning he scored in the 50 to 69 mark range.</p>
      <p>"I just want him to be happy. He tried his best, and that is all that matters," said Madam Shyamala.</p>
      <p>Rui Ze and Tejas were among the 40,256 Primary 6 pupils who received their PSLE results.</p>
      <p>For four years running, 98.4 per cent of this year's cohort progressed to secondary school.</p>
      <p>Of that, 66.3 per cent was eligible for the Express course, 21 per cent for the Normal (Academic) course and 11.2 per cent for Normal (Technical).</p>
      <p>A total of 634 students, or 1.6 per cent, are not qualified for the three courses and may choose to re-attempt the PSLE next year.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, they can apply to Assumption Pathway School or NorthLight School for a more hands-on learning approach.</p>
      <p>Students eligible for secondary schools may submit their choices online till next Wednesday, 3pm. The Secondary 1 posting results will be released on Dec 20.</p>
