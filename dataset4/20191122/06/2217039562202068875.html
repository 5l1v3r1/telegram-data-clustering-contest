        <b>Singapore's Yu Mengyu and Clarence Chew crashed out of the Seamaster T2 Diamond Singapore, the second and final stop of the T2 Diamond Table Tennis League, at Our Tampines Hub yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But the duo, who were the competition's host-exempted players, did not bow out without a fight.</p>
      <p>Yu lost 4-2 (11-7, 11-5, 11-5, 9-11, 3-5, 5-4) to China's Chen Xingtong, but threatened to pull off a comeback as the match entered the "Fast 5" phase (first to five points), which kicks in when there is no winner after 24 minutes.</p>
      <p>World No. 45 Yu, who had trailed 3-0, won the next two games to narrow the deficit to 3-2, but the 12th-ranked Chen sealed her quarter-final spot by clinching the following game.</p>
      <p>Chen, who admitted that she was still getting used to this format, paid tribute to Yu.</p>
      <p>Her last-eight opponent will be compatriot and world No. 5 Wang Manyu, who turned the tables on fourth-ranked Zhu Yuling by making the most of the "Fast 5" format.</p>
      <p>It seemed like yesterday's morning's match between the two Chinese players would be a repeat of the final during the July leg in Malaysia, where Zhu prevailed.</p>
      <p>Wang was trailing 3-1 (10-11, 5-11, 11-10, 1-5), but won the next three "Fast 5" games (5-4, 5-0, 5-4) to triumph 4-3.</p>
      <p>She said: "I couldn't really get into the match even when it reached the 'Fast 5', then it was a matter of adjusting and making sure I lasted the distance."</p>
      <p>Singapore's world No. 276 Chew took the fight to the fifth-ranked Tomokazu Harimoto, before Japan's top male player won 4-1 (11-6, 7-11, 11-5, 11-10, 5-2).</p>
      <p>Chew, whose next assignment is the Nov 30-Dec 11 SEA Games, said: "It was great to be in this tournament in the company of the world's best players.</p>
      <p>"I had nothing to lose, so I just went out and did my best. Tomo is very experienced and he handled the big points better."</p>
      <p>Singapore's remaining representative Feng Tianwei takes on world No. 1 Chen Meng today.</p>
