      <p>Indian musical maestro AR Rahman has collaborated with popular Irish band U2 for a single titled “Ahimsa”. The song drops before U2 is all set to perform in India for the first time on December 15.</p>
      <p>AR Rahman shared on Twitter, “‘I’ll meet you where there is no sleeping… But we wake up to dream…’ Here is my latest collaboration ‘Ahimsa’ with @U2”</p>

      <p>The song opens with the vocals of Rahman’s daughters Khatija and Raheema as they sing a Tamil verse. Soon, Bono takes over and a huge rush of nostalgia takes over. A collaboration between Rahman and U2 has certainly been a dream of many music fans and after a long wait, the dream has finally come true.</p>
      <p>To make his fans curious, AR Rahman had earlier shared a photo with U2 band members Bono and The Edge.</p>

      <p>AR Rahman said in a statement, “Ahimsa requires courage and strength. A quality that is impervious to weapons or power. It’s a mission which is most needed to heal the modern world and it is incredible timing to collaborate with U2, with their amazing legacy, to revive this movement.”</p>
      <p>U2’s Bono said, “The fight against injustice has always been so important to us. We were somewhat shaped and formed by Martin Luther King who was a student of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>. Martin Luther King said ‘The moral arc of the universe is long but it bends towards justice’. I don’t believe that any more. It doesn’t bend towards justice, it has to be bent towards justice. We have to be actively involved in our democracy to preserve it and show people how we feel and what we care about. We come as students to the source of inspiration. That is ahimsa, non-violence. India gave this to us, the greatest gift to the world. It is more powerful than nuclear energy, the armies, the navies, the British Empire. It is power itself. And it’s never been more important.”</p>
      <p>For U2’s Indian fans, this certainly builds up the hype before the band delivers its debut performance in India and along with the classics, we’ll surely get to hear this song as well.</p>
