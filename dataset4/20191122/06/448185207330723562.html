      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI:</b> Padma Bhusan Begum Parveen Sultana who has been winning hearts in India as well abroad through her enthralling performance in the field of Hindustani classical music, will come to her home State Assam on December 7 for a musical evening.  The musical evening is being organized at Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra auditorium by The Library, a socio-cultural organization.</p>
      <p>“Parveen Sultana is thrilled to be home, to her people and to perform for them. Although nowadays she rarely perform, the stage nevertheless continues to be her favourite. Assam is her heart and soul, she belongs to the land of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Assamese is her mother tongue,” Nawa Bhagawati, president of The Library said told reporters here on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Parveen Sultana had attained national acclaim way back in the Seventies and, since then, dominated the Hindustani classical music with her matchless skill and brilliant style of rendition. She started winning accolades from the Mumbai film music fraternity in 1972 when music director Naushad invited her to sing a small Thumri item for Kamal Amrohi’s legendary cinematic piece Pakeeza. While all the songs of Pakeeza—Inhi logone, Chalte chalte and Thare rahiyo sung by Lata Mangeshkar became smash hits, Parveen Sultana’s Kaun gali gaye shyam also created ripples. The small number immediately took her to stardom and Parveen was invited by the Mangeshkars to be the chief guest at Lata’s birthday bash that year. She almost became a household name after she sang Hamein tum se pyar kitna in the film Kudrat.</p>
      <p>“The Library, a socio-cultural and non-profit making organization set up by like-minded people from different walks of life, has been making humble endeavor to promote individuals who have made significant contributions towards promoting Assamese culture and music. The upcoming Parveen Sultana’s music evening is just one of the humble endeavours of our organization,” Lachit Kalita, general secretary of The Library said.</p>
      <p>“We sincerely hope that the music lovers of Assam that  Parveen Sultana will mesmerize them on December 7 by singing many of her immortal songs,” Bhagawati said.</p>
