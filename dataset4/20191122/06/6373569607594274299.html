      <h1>Bradford City insider's guide to what Plymouth Argyle can expect from Gary Bowyer's Bantams</h1>
      <h2>Third-placed Bradford will be the visitors to Home Park in League Two on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Bradford City will return to League Two action after a three-week break when they take on Plymouth Argyle at Home Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Gary Bowyer's side currently occupy third position, but have played fewer games than the two teams just above them in the table - leaders Swindon Town and Forest Green Rovers.</p>
      <p>Bradford's last league game was on November 2 when they beat Exeter City 2-0 at Valley Parade.</p>
      <p>Since then the Bantams have played League One outfit Shrewsbury Town twice in the FA Cup first round, losing 1-0 at home in a replay on Tuesday after drawing 1-1 away.</p>
      <p>City also lost 2-1 to Rochdale in the EFL Trophy at Valley Parade. Promotion, though, has always been the top priority for Bowyer and Bradford and they are on course to achieve that.</p>
      <p>Plymouth Live has got the lowdown on the Bantams from Simon Parker, chief sports writer at the Bradford Telegraph and Argus.</p>
      <h3>HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS BRADFORD'S SEASON SO FAR?</h3>
      <p>They are well placed at this stage without really playing to their potential.</p>
      <p>The home form has been strong and the squad have gelled well considering the large overhaul in the summer.</p>
      <p>There is a question mark, though, over whether they can score enough goals – an issue that has been highlighted even more by the spectacular form of Eoin Doyle on loan for Swindon.</p>
      <h3>HOW GOOD A JOB HAS GARY BOWYER DONE CONSIDERING HOW BADLY LAST SEASON WENT FOR CITY?</h3>
      <p>He’s done very well in reuniting the team and the fans after the discontent surrounding their relegation.</p>
      <p>Bowyer wanted to restore that bond and the new players have certainly bought into that.</p>
      <p>But ultimately he will be judged on where City finish at the end of the season.</p>
      <h3>WHAT HAVE BEEN THE KEYS TO BRADFORD'S SUCCESS SO FAR THIS SEASON AND WHAT ARE THE TARGETS FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN?</h3>
      <p>Bowyer has added height and pace to a squad that was totally lacking in both areas before. They are generally solid defensively and the addition of Callum Cooke has strengthened the midfield.</p>
      <p>The target has always been to bounce straight back up and that has not altered.</p>
      <p>Being knocked out of the FA Cup this week, while a big disappointment in financial terms, means there are no distractions from the league.</p>
      <h3>WHAT CAN ARGYLE FANS EXPECT TO SEE FROM BRADFORD AT HOME PARK ON SATURDAY?</h3>
      <p>They are generally well-organised and well-drilled with the pace to threaten on the break through the likes of Dylan Connolly.</p>
      <p>City won’t come for a point, although that wouldn’t be the worst result, and will look to take the game to Plymouth when they can.</p>
      <h3>BILLY CLARKE HAD TWO SPELLS AT BRADFORD AND IS NOW AT ARGYLE. HOW IS HE REMEMBERED BY THE CITY FANS?</h3>
      <p>Clarke made his name with City during the FA Cup run to the quarter-finals in 2015, memorably scoring the deflected opener in the fifth-round win over Premier League Sunderland at Valley Parade.</p>
      <p>He was also in the team that reached the League One play-off final two years later and had City’s best scoring chance well saved by Millwall keeper Jordan Archer.</p>
      <p>It didn’t really happen for Clarke when he returned last season and found game-time limited.</p>
      <h3>HOW HAVE FORMER ARGYLE PAIR KELVIN MELLOR AND ANTHONY O'CONNOR DONE FOR CITY THIS SEASON?</h3>
      <p>Anthony O’Connor has recovered from a tough first season at the club to forge a solid partnership at centre half with Ben Richards-Everton.</p>
      <p>Kelvin Mellor is another to feature regularly in City’s back four at right back, although he has been edged out recently by Adam Henley.</p>

      <h3>ARE THERE ANY PLAYERS WHO ARE INJURED OR SUSPENDED?</h3>
      <p>Striker Clayton Donaldson is out until Christmas after an operation to repair a broken toe. Midfielder Jamie Devitt, on loan from Blackpool, has also been sidelined long term with a torn hamstring.</p>
      <p>There is better news with Rotherham loanee Matty Palmer, who is close to returning after two months out.</p>
