      <h1>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sends Instagram post to Gabriel Martinelli that Arsenal fans will love</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal captain posted a humorous message to the youngster on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has a reputation for regularly joking with his <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> teammates on social media, and the striker was up to his mischievous ways again - this time with <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/all-about/gabriel-martinelli">Gabriel Martinelli</a> .</p>
      <p>Martinelli has made a big impact at the Emirates since joining from Ituano FC in the summer. The Brazilian striker has scored seven goals in nine appearances, including two in the recent League Cup defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was an unused substitute for the Premier League loss to Leicester before the international break, but is set to be included in Unai Emery's squad for Saturday's clash against Southampton.</p>
      <p>Speaking previously to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NEEYw75MaOMXERuSqyZV0?si=0Wvza3ONTfO1oMVQzorspg">ESPN Brazil</a>, the striker says he is focused on working hard to earn a first league start.</p>
      <p>"I have to thank God for this opportunity, the gaffer and the team gave me a big welcome and I'm trying to get opportunities and do the best I can with them," he said.</p>
      <p>"I have to be patient since I'm young and the gaffer talked to me saying I should be patient and wait for the chances, cause they will come."</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy, and I thank god a lot for this," he said.</p>
      <p>"I want to make my career here and try to be a legend."</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the youngster posted a picture on Instagram of himself recently playing for Brazil's under-23 side.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang replied to the picture with: 'Dooo brrrraaazzzzziiiiiiuuu' with laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans will be hoping that the Gabon striker continues to keep spirits high in the dressing room, ahead of the visit from Southampton.</p>
