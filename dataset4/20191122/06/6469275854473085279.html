        <b>Morecambe boss Derek Adams says he is preparing his team for a tough trip to one of the early League Two pacesetters Crewe Alexandra on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dave Artell’s side have been the shock package in the league this year and currently sit fourth, just three points off top spot.</p>
      <p>Adams admits his side will have to be at their best against a Crewe side who defeated the Shrimps 6-0 on their last trip to Gresty Road in August 2018.</p>
      <p>However, the Shrimps will make the trip in good spirits following an EFL Trophy win against Carlisle United and a point at Crawley Town in their first two matches under Adams.</p>
      <p>Adams said: “Crewe have started really well and picked up some excellent results.</p>
      <p>“They have a team that can mix things up a bit and have a mixture of youth and experience.</p>
      <p>“We all know they have a tradition for playing good football but I have watched them this season and I know they can go direct as well.</p>
      <p>“In Chris Porter they have a clever striker who has been scoring goals at this level for some time and in players like Charlie Kirk have some really promising youngsters.</p>
      <p>“It will be a tough game but we certainly won’t be frightened.</p>
      <p>“They have lost their last two league games and we will go into the game on the back of picking up a really good point at Crawley and a win over Carlisle.</p>
      <p>“In both games we came from behind and although I have only been here a short time I have seen that we have a lot of resilience and togetherness in our squad that will stand us in good stead.</p>
      <p>“We have work to do but I am pleased with what I have seen so far and we will keep working hard and will be ready for the challenge.”</p>
