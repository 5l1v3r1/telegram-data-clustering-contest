      <p>The Willie Mullins seven-year-old was a perfect five from five as a novice chase during the 2017-18 campaign - but last term was a damp squib with defeats in all three starts.</p>
      <p>Sent off at 4-5 for the two-mile, six-furlong Listed <a href="http://boomerang.ie/">Boomerang.ie</a> Chase at Thurles, Daryl Jacob’s mount strolled home by 10 lengths.</p>
      <p>“It is lovely to see the horse back on the racetrack and he had plenty of enthusiasm and jumped and travelled very, very well,” enthused the winning rider.</p>
      <p>“It's a great starting point for him and he never missed a beat the whole way around.</p>

      <p>“Today's trip wasn't a problem for him and ideally going a little bit quicker early doors would have suited him, but he is nice and fresh and it was good to see a performance like that this early in the year.</p>
      <p>“It was mission accomplished today,” added Jacob, whose mount is 12-1 with Paddy Power for the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on Boxing Day.</p>
      <p>Hollie Doyle became the third female jockey to rack up 100 winners in a calendar year when Perfect Crown made a victorious debut at Chelmsford City yesterday.</p>

      <p>RED FORCE ONE gets a confident vote to atone for a narrow defeat over course and distance 10 days ago with a victory in the concluding Rewarding Ownership With The ROA Handicap Hurdle (3.45).</p>
      <p>The Paul Nicholls four-year-old went under by a neck to all-the-way scorer Gumball - the winner ran a cracker when second in the Greatwood Hurdle last Sunday - and a 4lb rise in the weights for that run looks within range.</p>
