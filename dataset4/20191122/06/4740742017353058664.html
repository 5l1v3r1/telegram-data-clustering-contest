      <h1>Ian Holloway: Graham Coughlan should be demanding Bristol Rovers keep Jonson Clarke-Harris before looking at new signings</h1>
      <h2>The Bristol Rovers legend reflects on the Gas' FA Cup win over Bromley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Holloway</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Rovers fans will be hoping FA Cup revenue boosts Graham Coughlan’s chances of boosting his squad with new signings during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>But, while the 1-0 first round replay win at Bromley on Tuesday night could prove massive in the manager’s efforts to build on an encouraging start to the season, in his position I would be pressing the board to make keeping Jonson Clarke-Harris the priority.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/how-much-bristol-rovers-made-3558944">If that means using the bonus money earned from a second round home tie against Plymouth Argyle</a> to offer the striker the sort of contract that makes staying at the Memorial Stadium an attractive prospect then so be it.</p>
      <p>There has been enough disruption at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> in recent times and, while I am as keen as anyone to see more quality players brought in, more than anything I want to see us hang onto a proven goalscorer for once.</p>

      <p>Graham did amazingly to sign Clarke-Harris last January, but no manager can keep on pulling rabbits out of hat like that.</p>
      <p>Lose your top marksman and how do you replace him? Jonson’s winning goal at Bromley demonstrated again his importance to the team on a night when the result was far more important than the performance.</p>
      <p>That tie was a potential banana skin for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> from the moment it was drawn out of the hat. Having falied to win at the Mem, the chances of an upset increased with the replay being staged on the National League side’s artificial pitch.</p>
      <p>The TV cameras were there anticipating a Bromley victory and another FA Cup giant-killing story. Rovers did a professional job on the night, but not for the first time their top-scorer ensured those efforts were rewarded.</p>
      <p>Good strikers change games, which is why they command higher salaries than players in other positions. I'm sure Clarke-Harris is not being paid the wage he deserves for the impact he has had on the team and the club need to remedy that quickly to stand any chance of keeping him.</p>
      <p>Sometimes no matter how hard you try as a manager it is impossible to retain ambitious footballers when bigger clubs come in for them.</p>
      <p>I found that to my cost when I was Rovers manager. You can only hope that everything possible is done to stop someone like Jonson leaving and at least the cup revenue, which wouldn’t have been budgeted for, provides that opportunity.</p>
      <p>What pleased me most about the Bromley result was another clean sheet. Rovers have conceded only twice in four matches this month and are starting to show the defensive steel that was Graham Coughlan’s trademark as a player.</p>
      <p>Even more encouraging is the fact that young defenders <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-january-transfer-window-3557778">like Alfie Kilgour and Rollin Menayese are coming to the fore, no doubt aided by the wise old head of Tony Craig.</a></p>

      <p>The manager became a hero with Plymouth fans for the defensive qualities he displayed over many seasons at the club as a player and it now seems he is instilling the same attitude through his coaching.</p>
      <p>I don’t mind repeating that I think he is doing one hell of a good job, particularly in view of the unsteady ship <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> were when he took charge.</p>
      <p>Fair-minded fans will want to back Graham and give him as much time as possible to make further progress. But, as Mauricio Pochettino found out this week, time is not a manager’s friend in the modern game.</p>
      <p>Surely what he has achieved with Tottenham Hotspur entitled him to some leeway in solving the problem of the team’s dip in form this season.</p>
      <p>Instead, we can now take it for granted that the Spurs hierarchy were talking to Jose Mourinho behind his back. Nothing else could explain the rapid installation of the ‘Special One’ as Pochettino’s replacement.</p>
      <p>I find that sort of thing thoroughly distasteful. It goes against the values instilled in me by my parents from an early age and shows football in a very poor light.</p>
      <p>As Harry Redknapp said after news came out of Pochettino’s sacking, the game is being run by ruthless businessmen.</p>
      <p>I don’t like that type of person and it angers me that they are having an ever-increasing influence on the game I love.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, you can still find the sort of characters, who used to be the life-blood of football at grass roots level, as I found when asked to do an after-dinner speech at Longwell Green Sports FC the other night.</p>
      <p>My dad Bill helped to form that club more than half a century ago, having been one of the regulars drinking at Longwell Green Working Men’s Club.</p>
      <p>He even had a six-a-side tournament there named after him. I played for the junior team as a kid and it was great to go back and see some familiar old faces.</p>
      <p>It was a million miles away from the world of the businessmen running our Premier League clubs and, to my way of thinking, a far healthier environment that does our national game nothing but credit.</p>
      <p>Will Mourinho be a success at Spurs? One problem with the dressing room may well be that Harry Kane is on a lot more money than anyone else.</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t surprise me if Jose tried to solve that by improving the contracts of other squad members or bringing in new signings on similar money to Kane.</p>
      <p>That would test Spurs’ wage budget and give the men who showed Pochettino the door plenty to think about.</p>
