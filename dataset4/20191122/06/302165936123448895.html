      <h1>Khairy denies seeking to debate power transition in Parliament</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 22 — Former Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin said the photograph of a letter he purportedly wrote to propose a parliamentary debate on Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) power transition was fake.</p>
      <p>He posted the denial on Facebook and said he did not submit any notice or letter to the Secretary of the House Datuk Roosme Hamzah about the purported debate.</p>
      <p>“The action of the impersonators who used my name was most irresponsible and slanderous to my reputation as the member of parliament for Rembau and Barisan Nasional,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, images of the letter purportedly from Khairy to Roosme began circulating online.</p>
      <p>The letter dated November 20 stated that Khairy was notifying the House of his intention to submit a motion to discuss the power transition involving the post of the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Pakatan Harapan chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is the prime minister and the ruling coalition has agreed for PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to succeed him.</p>
      <p>However, the lack of clarity on when this would happen has allowed conspiracy theories to thrive and views of Malaysia’s political instability to linger.</p>
      <p>The issue has also provided PH’s rivals ample fodder with which to pit the ruling coalition’s parties and leaders against one another.</p>
      <p>Khairy alluded to this in his post when he said he did not wish to be dragged into the matter.</p>
      <p>“I am not involved and have no interest in being involved. The question of succession (while very important) should be settled by Pakatan.</p>
      <p>“It has nothing to do with my party or me.”</p>
