      <p>Digital identity solutions provider <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Syntizen">Syntizen</a> has tied up with the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Uttar-Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> government for its <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Aadhaar">Aadhaar</a> based <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/subsidy">subsidy</a> management system, which uses the data to verify the identity of the recipient.</p>
      <p>The Hyderabad-based firm has been providing the subsidy management system to the Telangana government for the last two years and is now in talks with other state governments as well.</p>
      <p>“The subsidy management system has helped Telangana save a significant amount of money by plugging subsidy leakages in the past year,” said <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Siddharth-Kukatlapalli">Siddharth Kukatlapalli</a>, cofounder, Syntizen.</p>
      <p>“One of the biggest problems with the current system has been the inability to ensure that the benefits paid out were going to the right person,” he said.</p>
      <p>The solution uses Aadhaar data to verify a person’s identity before he/she can avail a specific government service, or subsidy, thereby eliminating fake or bogus entries.</p>
      <p>One of its applications has been in government scholarships that are handed out annually. Aadhaar of students in the state has been linked to their roll number and they have to use biometrics to mark attendance.</p>
      <p>Using this data, the department ensures that only students who have the minimum required attendance are eligible for the scholarship program.</p>
      <p>“The good thing about Syntizen is that their ability to implement any project, which is given to them, is pretty fast. They understand the scope of the project pretty well. The model is very robust, and scalable,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary, Information Technology, Electronics &amp; Communications, Telangana.</p>
      <p>Incubated at T-Hub in Hyderabad, Syntizen was set up by 2014 by Kukatlapalli, along with Vamsi Kotte and Dinesh Desu. It has so far raised funds from Mastercard and ACPL, a biometrics solution provider.</p>
      <p>“For the mid-day meals scheme, we found that out of the 150 students that were being shown at a particular school, only 110 were actually consuming the meal while the rest were bogus entries,” Kukatlapalli said.</p>
      <p>Apart from the subsidy management system, the company also provides a video KYC solution as well as a digital identity verification solution for private companies. However, the Supreme Court ruling last year disallowing the use of Aadhaar by private enterprises has affected that.</p>
      <p>The company has now created an Aadhaar masking tool that can pick up the unique identification data in any format and mask it, in keeping with the apex court guidelines.</p>
