      <p>Syrex, a leading provider of virtualised and hybrid network infrastructures and solutions, has once again demonstrated its commitment to community upliftment and care for the underprivileged by contributing to the annual Santa Shoebox initiative.</p>
      <p>Every year, Santa Shoebox collects and distributes personalised gifts for underprivileged children across SA and Namibia.</p>

      <p>The Santa Shoebox Project originated in Cape Town in 2006. The shoeboxes are distributed to more than 1 000 facilities each year. When the project started out, it only sent 180 shoeboxes; today the project has donated a total number of <br/>652 180 shoeboxes and changed many young lives.</p>
      <p>Staff from Syrex contributed 60 boxes this year and enabled the company to ‘adopt’ an entire school in Diepsloot for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The company sponsored the wrapping and décor for the boxes.</p>

      <p>“We are delighted that our team have once again committed to this very special and wonderful project,” said Vivienne Herselman, Operations Director at Syrex. “While we have done this before, every year the need seems greater and the challenge to make a difference to someone’s life is that much more serious.</p>
      <p>"We live in difficult times, unemployment is rife and consumers are stretched to the hilt. We are thrilled at our staff, who make it a priority to contribute in this way to this very worthwhile cause and perhaps turn a frown into a smile this Christmas.”</p>
