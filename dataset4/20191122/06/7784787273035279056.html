      <h1>Paul McGregor reveals ‘different approach’ for Dragons in 2020 as Shane Flanagan prepares to join club</h1>

      <h3>St George Illawarra coach Paul McGregor says his side will take a “different approach” to games in 2020 following the exit of Gareth Widdop and the uncertain future of Jack de Belin.</h3>
      <p>As McGregor and his new support staff look for ways to improve on 2019’s disappointing 15th placed finish, the coach revealed the Red V’s game plan — which focused heavily on Widdop and de Belin — will change next season.</p>
      <p>Widdop, who has jetted off to join Warrington in the Super League, was sidelined for most of 2019 following a dislocated shoulder suffered in Round 3, while de Belin remains stood down while he faces rape charges.</p>

      <p>“A lot of the structures we built over the last three or four years was around Gareth and around Jack,” McGregor told <i>Sky Sports’ Big Sports Breakfast</i>.</p>
      <p>“Gareth’s a world class player, so it’s really important you really identify what the team needs around Gareth, so we bought Ben Hunt to really work with Gareth in that space and then we lost him.</p>
      <p>“Jack’s really our glue in the middle, our link in our shifts. He’s our ball-playing forward. He’s an Origin forward.</p>

      <p>“So we’re obviously going to play a way where we’re not over-relying on those two guys, which is totally different to what we worked for the past two years.</p>
      <p>“There’s going to be a different approach to the game, and certainly defensively we really took a couple of steps backward.</p>
      <p>“The year before we had intent, we had line speed, and we were there for one another, and I don’t think that was the case.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to get our ‘D’ right and we change the way we play and after six rounds, people can judge then. But we’ve got to get to those six rounds before people start judging.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, the Dragons announced eight coaching staff changes following Phil Gould’s review of the club.</p>
      <p>While McGregor retained his job, assistants Ben Hornby and Mick Crawley departed, replaced by premiership-winning Sharks and Knights assistant coach James Shepherd.</p>
      <p>Others changes included a new head physiotherapist, strength and conditioning coach and a “mind and performance” coach who will run meditation lessons.</p>
      <p>McGregor said the club were also close to formally announcing the appointment of Shane Flanagan who will be tasked with improving the club’s leaky defence, alongside Dean Young.</p>
      <p>“I interviewed 10 coaches and Shane was the most impressive in our interviews,” McGregor said.</p>
      <p>“I think Shane is a real good fella. and I don’t know him too well, but the conversation I had I’m really looking forward to bouncing ideas off him.</p>
      <p>“The experience he’s got is going to help. I’ve heard some different things, but what I heard from Shane was a guy that’s really missed the game and wants to get back into the game and will do anything he can for the team.</p>

      <p>“ … If you’ve ever played Cronulla they’re ready to scrap, he gets them down and dirty. He’ll be looking after our defence with Dean, which is a really good thing.</p>
      <p>“He’s not going to come back until January which is a little bit difficult at this stage because your in-season is made from your pre-season.</p>
      <p>“However, he’ll get a real good eight-week block before we start playing to get down and get some skin in the game.”</p>
