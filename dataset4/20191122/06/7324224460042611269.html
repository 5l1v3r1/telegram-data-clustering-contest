      <h2>Almost 200 flat-pack homes are set to spring up on the site of a former secondary school in Wolverhampton.</h2>

      <p>Northicote School in Bushbury was reduced to rubble in July last year.</p>
      <p>Now 196 homes could be built in its place in Northwood Park Road with the timber-framed houses built at LoCal Homes in Walsall before being put together on site.</p>
      <p>Several meetings were held by Accord Housing Association and WV Living for the future of the site in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>And now a planning application has been submitted by WV Living to Wolverhampton Council to kick-start the revamp of the disused site.</p>

      <p>It says: "The main objective of the scheme is to address the housing shortage in the area, especially with regard to the offer of new build homes for local residents."</p>
      <p>The proposed houses will be split into 147 for private buyers and 49 which will be socially rented.</p>
      <p>Gardens, parking spaces and four access roads will be created at the heart of the development – with the roads connecting with Northwood Park Road.</p>
      <p>And two football pitches on Northwood Park will be improved as part of the plan, with new goal posts, surface improvements and markings.</p>

      <p>Northicote School closed following a merger with Pendeford School to form the North East Wolverhampton Academy.</p>
      <p>It was classed as failing by Ofsted – becoming the first school to receive the rating – before undergoing a turnaround under the guidance of headteacher Sir Geoff Hampton, who was knighted for his role.</p>
