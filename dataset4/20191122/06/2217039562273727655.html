        <b>A 17-year-old pleaded guilty yesterday to having sex with a minor and for asking a child to perform an indecent act on him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The teenager, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victims, met his first victim last year when she was 13 and he was 16.</p>
      <p>They were in the same co-curricular activity in their secondary school.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, they met at a staircase landing at a multi-storey carpark and started kissing.</p>
      <p>Later, in June, they went to the same place and were talking when he suddenly removed his pants and underwear.</p>
      <p>He then forcibly placed the victim's hand on his private parts, but became upset after she did not do anything.</p>
      <p>He told her she had wasted his time and left, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Mansoor Amir.</p>
      <p>The victim lodged a police report in March this year.</p>
      <p>Sometime at the end of 2018, the second victim, then 13, heard about the accused from her friend, who said he was "hot" and "handsome".</p>
      <p>The victim decided to find out for herself and followed the accused on Instagram, where they started chatting.</p>
      <p>In February this year, they agreed to have lunch and hang out.</p>
      <p>Prior to the meeting, he asked the victim if she wanted his "nudes", but the victim did not know what that was.</p>
      <p>She thought he was referring to his face as she associated the word nude with a make-up brand.</p>
      <h3>PHOTOS</h3>
      <p>She was shocked when he sent her a picture of his private parts. But then sent him a photo of her bare chest after he asked her for it.</p>
      <p>On the day of their meet-up, he led her to a staircase landing and asked her to perform a sex act on him.</p>
      <p>She agreed.</p>
      <p>They also had sex.</p>
      <p>The victim told a senior student about the incident the next day and a teacher was informed.</p>
      <p>A police report was lodged.</p>
      <p>The court has ordered a probation report and the teenager is expected to be sentenced on Dec 19.</p>
      <p>Three other charges will be taken into consideration during sentencing.</p>
