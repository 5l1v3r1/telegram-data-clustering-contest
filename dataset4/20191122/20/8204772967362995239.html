      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Westpac">Westpac</a> Banking has “unreservedly” apologised after Australia’s financial crimes agency alleged a dozen customers funnelled money to southeast Asian nations to pay for child pornography and sexual abuse, amid the nation’s worst ever breach of money-laundering laws.</p>
      <p>“The notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry,” chairman <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Lindsay+Maxsted">Lindsay Maxsted</a> said in a statement after the board met on Friday. “As a board, and as individuals, we are devastated by the issues raised.”</p>
      <p>While not commenting explicitly on the future of chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Brian+Hartzer">Brian Hartzer</a>, Mr Maxsted said the “board, CEO and management team are fully committed to fixing these issues”.</p>
      <h3>Worst transgression</h3>
      <p>Mr Hartzer (52) has been under pressure since the bank was sued on Wednesday for allegedly breaching money-laundering laws 23 million times, a number that puts it among the worst transgressions reported globally in recent years.</p>
      <p>While Mr Hartzer has vowed to stay in the job and lead the response to the claims, the bank has faced criticism from prime minister <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Scott+Morrison">Scott Morrison</a>, pension funds and investors.</p>
      <p>Westpac said it would appoint independent experts to review efforts to improve compliance with anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. – Bloomberg</p>
