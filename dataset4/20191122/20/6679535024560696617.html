      <h1>Pak’s inflation due to previous govt’s flawed policies: Imran Khan</h1>
      <h2>The Pak PM was addressing a public gathering in his hometown of Mianwali in Punjab province</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:32:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said that the current issue of inflation in Pakistan was due to the flawed economic policies of the previous government and the cash-strapped nation would overcome the problem soon.</p>
      <p>Addressing a public gathering in his hometown of Mianwali in Punjab province, Khan said his government had inherited multiple economic issues, including low foreign exchange reserves, a huge circular debt and fiscal and current account deficits from the previous government.</p>
      <p>Pakistan’s economy was in a bad shape when the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government came to power in August 2018.</p>
      <p>On November 8, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached an accord with Pakistan to complete the first review under the extended agreement that will allow significant funding to the cash-strapped country from bilateral and multilateral partners.</p>
      <p>“The previous administration had been spending reserve dollars to stabilise and maintain the value of the local currency against the dollar,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Khan said Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had not found enough dollars to follow suit so a correction strategy followed.</p>
      <p>“As a result, the value of the rupee against the dollar depreciated by 35 per cent, he said, adding that the devaluation opened the floodgates for inflation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Khan said the country’s economy was on a correction course and the measures taken by government’s economic team started yielding results.</p>
      <p>“The Rupee stabilised and the current account deficit was reduced for the first time in four years,” he said.</p>
