      <p>Nintendo NY has unveiled a smashing brand new Bowser statue which will take a prominent place in the store going forward. You’ll be able to check it out today and it has replaced the iconic Donkey Kong statue that was previously there. Not the best of timing given that we are currently celebrating DK’s 25th anniversary. Anyway, check it out above!</p>
