      <p>Tesla’s Cybertruck unveiling on Thursday night in Hawthorne, California, began on a slightly absurd note.</p>
      <p>A mesh of lasers crossed the stage, and a hologram of a woman in a blond wig appeared.</p>
      <p>“In the future, there will be no straws, I promise,” she said.</p>
      <p>Spectators quickly began to speculate that the “hologram girl” was none other than Grimes, the alt-pop singer and girlfriend of Tesla CEO Elon Musk whose real name is Claire Boucher.</p>

      <h3>“Los Angeles, November 2019. The skies are polluted. The world is addicted to oil,” the maybe-Grimes hologram said at the start of the event.</h3>

      <h3>“But we’re here to offer a solution: the Cybertruck. The No. 1 mode of transport for a cybergirl. The greatest evolution in vehicular fashion and function. I now present to you my creator,” she said before Musk entered onstage.</h3>
