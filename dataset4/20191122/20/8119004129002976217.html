      <p>The unit in a meeting presided over by its chief Mohammad Nazrul Islam Hiru cancelled her membership and sacked her as the women affairs secretary of the district committee on Friday.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Open University had in October expelled her, and cancelled her registration and examinations after investigation into media reports on the allegation.</p>
      <p>Bubly is the widow of the then Narsingdi municipality mayor and Awami League leader Lokman Hossain, who was assassinated in a gun attack in 2011.</p>
      <p>She was elected MP by the ruling party from the seats reserved for women earlier this year following the last general election.</p>
      <p>She has a Higher Secondary Certificate and got admitted to the BOU’s BA course for graduation.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, she had been in Dhaka but sent other people to eight exams as proxy candidates, one of whom was caught in the act.</p>
      <p>“It has done great damage to the image of Bangladesh and the Awami League,” Narsingdi Awami League chief Hiru told bdnews24.com, noting that Bubly made headlines in both international and local media after the BOU gaffe.</p>
      <p>The district committee took the steps against her following instructions from the central committee, Hiru said and added: “Now we are informing the central committee about our decisions.”</p>
      <p>Narsingdi-4 MP and Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun, Narsigndi-2 MP Anwarul Ashraf Khan, Narsingdi-3 MP Jahirul Haque Bhuiyan Mohon, among others, attended the meeting.</p>
