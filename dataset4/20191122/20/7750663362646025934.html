      <h1>Farke: 'We won't park the bus against Everton'</h1>
      <h2>Norwich boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-farke/"><b>Daniel Farke</b></a> maintains his struggling team will not be kicking the ball into the River Mersey when they head to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/"><b>Everton</b></a>, determined to drag themselves off the bottom of the Premier League.</h2>

      <p>The Canaries slumped to a 2-0 home defeat by previously-winless Watford before the international break which left them with just one point from seven games.</p>
      <p>Since producing a remarkable 3-2 victory over Manchester City in mid-September, head coach Farke has so far failed to find the winning formula again.</p>
      <p>With centre-back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christoph-zimmermann/"><b>Christoph Zimmermann</b></a> close to a return from the foot injury which has ruled him out since the end of August, Norwich could see some much-needed reinforcement.</p>
      <p>Goals have also been at a premium, with just two following the win over Manchester City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/teemu-pukki/"><b>Teemu Pukki</b></a> has not found the net since – although he did score three times over the international break as Finland booked their place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Farke, though, is not about to abandon the philosophy which saw Norwich sweep to the Sky Bet Championship title last season.</p>
      <p>"You have to be convinced by your style," the German coach said.</p>
      <p>"We built the squad in that way, so you can't expect us to just park the bus or put the balls in the river.</p>
      <p>"We have plans B, C, D and E – so we have to be flexible within our philosophies. We have to adapt to each opponent."</p>
      <p>Farke added at a press conference: "On this level you are punished for every mistake.</p>
      <p>"You have to remember players are human beings, not just the young lads. They were used to winning games and being praised.</p>
      <p>"We responded to every loss last season with a win, so there was no crisis. On this level, you have difficult periods.</p>
      <p>"We have to learn because we are not experienced in a relegation battle."</p>
      <p>Despite heavy investment, Everton have found themselves in a testing run, but went into the international break on the back of a much-needed away win at Southampton.</p>
      <p>Farke said: "Everton shouldn't have to fight relegation. They have potential to fight for Europe and (manager) <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a> has all the abilities as a coach to lead them to that.</p>
      <p>"Their last few results have been good, so you could say it's not the best time to play them, but we can't change that.</p>
      <p>"It will be difficult so we are respectful, but we want to win some points."</p>
      <p>Although captain Zimmerman could return, Northern Ireland full-back Jamal Lewis is sidelined by a knee problem.</p>
      <p>Swiss forward Josip Drmic, meanwhile, faces up to six weeks out with a hamstring tear picked up against Watford.</p>
      <p>"I trust all my players and that we have a proper group who can put in a good performance at Goodison Park," Farke said.</p>
