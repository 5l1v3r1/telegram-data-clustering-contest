      <p>A few hours after <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-holmes-yovanovitch-impeachment">sounding off</a> on the impeachment inquiry during a lengthy call to “Fox and Friends” Friday morning, President Trump still had more grievances to air.</p>
      <p>While speaking to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump insisted that the “impeachment hoax” has “worked out incredibly well.”</p>
      <p>“I think we had a tremendous week with the hoax,” Trump said. “You know, the great hoax. They call it the impeachment hoax. And that’s really worked out incredibly well.”</p>
      <p>Trump then said that support from the GOP has reached a new level.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen support in the Republican Party like we do right now,” he said. “We’ve never had this kind of support.”</p>
      <p>Republicans vigorously defended Trump during the impeachment hearings, with House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) speaking at length about various debunked conspiracy theories that would benefit the President. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), who joined the Intel Committee for the express purpose of being an attack dog for the Republicans, barked at the witnesses every chance he got.</p>
      <p>When pressed on whether the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry should be fired, Trump dodged the question but called the whistleblower “fake.”</p>
      <p>“What whistleblower?” Trump said. “I don’t think there is. I consider it to be a fake whistleblower, because what he wrote didn’t correspond to what I said.”</p>
