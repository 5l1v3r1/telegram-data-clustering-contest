      <h1>Zinedine Zidane speaks out on Gareth Bale flag controversy</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> boss Zinedine Zidane has dimissed the controversy created by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gareth-bale/">Gareth Bale</a> this week following Wales’ win against Hungary.</p>
      <p>The forward was seen celebrating with a flag that said ‘Wales, Golf, Madrid. In that order’ following his country’s qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Bale has been heavily criticised for his actions in Spain and it was particularly untimely given he has not played for the club in a month but was fit for both of Wales’ qualifiers in the last week.</p>
      <p>But Zidane insists he saw no issue with Bale’s actions and the Frenchman insists he’s just happy to have the forward fit again.</p>

      <p>‘Things can happen outside but we have to look inside the club. What happens outside doesn’t bother us,’ said Zidane.</p>

      <p>‘I have spoken to Gareth like I do all players, every day we say hello and we talk if we pass in the club and that’s it.</p>
      <p>‘I am not interested in talking about what happened outside. He is OK and has trained normally with us and that is that.</p>
      <p>‘He is a player who has given lots to the club and I will look only at the sport, not what they say outside because there is a lot said and I am not here for that.</p>
      <p>‘I am not interested. It interests a lot of people but not me.’</p>
