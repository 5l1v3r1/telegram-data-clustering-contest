      <h1>Paul George: Knew Russell Westbrook, James Harden pairing with Rockets would work</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:50:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">Ohm Youngmisuk</a></address>
      <p>PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook">Russell Westbrook</a> might've gone their separate ways, but George immediately thought his former teammate would fit in just fine with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden">James Harden</a>.</p>
      <p>Not long after George worked a trade out with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> to go home and play for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a>, the All-Star watched Westbrook land with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> to join forces with his friend Harden.</p>
      <p>As George plays against Westbrook for the first time since both departed OKC after two seasons together, George says he never had any doubts about how Westbrook would work with Harden.</p>

      <p>"I knew it was going to work," George said at the morning shootaround before the Clippers face the Rockets on Friday night. "Russ is a winner. Russ wants to win, Russ does whatever it takes to win. My time playing with him, Russ doesn't really have an ego. He puts his ego to the side.</p>
      <p>"He allowed me to be myself, he allowed me to be comfortable. And I had one of the best career [years] I had while playing alongside him. Russ is a heckuva teammate."</p>
      <p>Playing alongside Westbrook, George finished third in MVP voting last season, averaging career-highs of 28 points and 8.2 rebounds to go with a career-high-tying 4.1 assists per game.</p>
      <p>The Thunder, though, lost in the first round of the playoffs for the third straight season, with George's shoulders ailing and both requiring surgery in the offseason. When <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> approached George in early July to recruit him to join forces, George said he spoke to Westbrook to gauge his feelings and about wanting to return home to L.A.</p>
      <p>"I made sure that was the first thing that I did was talk to Russ and get his temperature and see what he was looking [for] and see where he was at with things," George told ESPN in October during Clippers training camp. "The relationship [with Westbrook] never stopped. The relationship never was a part of the reason why I left. Me and Russ got along great. I enjoyed [it]. I learned so much from playing alongside Russ. He made me a better player and person."</p>
      <p>In his return from surgeries to repair a partially torn tendon in his right shoulder and a partial tear of his left labrum, George is averaging 28.3 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists.</p>
      <p>Westbrook is averaging 21.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and 6.9 assists this season.</p>
      <p>"The relationship with him was great," George said in October of his friendship with Westbrook. "It just came down to that point in my career where this is ultimately where I want to ride this thing out at. And that's how I looked at it."</p>
      <p>Friday will be George's fifth game with the Clippers but it's expected to be just his second playing alongside Leonard. The reigning Finals MVP returned on Wednesday from a left knee contusion injury that sidelined him for three games.</p>
      <p>George is saying he hopes this is the last stop of his NBA career.</p>
      <p>"This journey has been a blessing," the Palmdale native said. "Not a lot of people get to say they played back home, and honestly I'm hoping that this is the closing of my journey to be able to finish here in L.A.</p>
      <p>"It's a great chapter, great last part of my book, hopefully. And I'm looking forward to doing big things here."</p>
