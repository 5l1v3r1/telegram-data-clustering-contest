      <p>Fort Kochi Sub Collector Snehil Kumar Singh, who is in charge of overseeing the demolition of Maradu flats, on Friday ordered stoppage of demolition of a swimming pool at Alfa Serene apartments after cracks developed in a nearby house of one Hari Sai.</p>
      <p>A two-storey structure near the swimming pool was being demolished when a part of the building caved in with a thud. Mr. Singh visited the site after municipal chairperson T.H. Nadeera along with two councillors and a few people living near the apartments met and apprised him of the situation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Singh also asked the municipal engineer to make a video of the present situation at the site. The pillar supporting the stairs in the neighbouring house, which is separated by just a couple of metres from the demolition site, developed cracks.</p>
      <p>People in the house also experienced tremors. Similar was the experience of those in two other neighbouring houses, said Ms. Nadeera.</p>
      <p>She added Mr. Singh had been requested to station an expert official at the demolition sites.</p>
