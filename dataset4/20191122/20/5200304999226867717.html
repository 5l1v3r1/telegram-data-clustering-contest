      <p>Best known for his comedy productions, news has it that Indra Kumar has approached Sidharth Malhotra and Ajay Devgn for his next big project.</p>
      <p>According to  <i>IWM Buzz</i>, though the actors have yet to say yes to the project, they are busy getting stuck into their own individual projects. Where Malhotra’s ‘Marjaavaan’ is making money at the box office, the trailer for Devgn’s ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Hero’ is creating huge buzz amongst fans and critics alike. </p>
      <p>It seems Kumar is on the lookout for a fresh pairing, and where Devgn and Malhotra have yet to be seen together on screen, it’s fair to say that the film maker is on the right track.</p>
