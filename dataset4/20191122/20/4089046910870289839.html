      <p><b>HIGH POINT, N.C. (WBTV/Gray News) - </b>High Point University student Morgan Taylor came across an unexpected sight Wednesday night after witnessing what appears to be an employee at a local nail salon butchering a deer carcass inside of the establishment.</p>
      <p>The salon, Diamond Nails, is located just north of High Point. Taylor posted an image of the scene on social media, showing a woman going to work on the deer meat in what looks to be a waiting area in the salon.</p>
      <p>Taylor captioned her image with the hashtags “#notfawned” and “#ohbuckno,” while encouraging anyone who is “hunting” for a nail salon in the area to visit this establishment that specializes in "manicures, pedicures, and amateur deer butchers.”</p>
      <p>She said she has never visited the salon before but did report the incident to N.C. Cosmetic Arts.</p>
      <p>A Diamond Nails representative refused to comment about the incident.</p>
