      <p>Two people have been taken to hospital after a crash in Carmarthenshire.</p>
      <p>The collision happened at around 5.15pm on the westbound stretch of the A40 between Carmarthen and St Clears.</p>
      <p>The road was blocked for more than two hours, creating a huge traffic backlog in the area which stretched back to the B&amp;Q roundabout in Carmarthen.</p>
      <p>Police and fire crews have been in attendance, and two people had to be cut free from their vehicles.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said: “We were called at 5.17pm to reports of a two-vehicle road traffic collision between Llanllwch and Meidrim on the A40 in Carmarthenshire.</p>
      <p>“Two casualties have been extricated from vehicles using specialist cutting equipment.</p>
      <p>“Crews left the scene shortly after 7.20pm.”</p>
      <p>The fire service confirmed that two casualties were taken to hospital, but there is no update on the severity of any injuries suffered.</p>
