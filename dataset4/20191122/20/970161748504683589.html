      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a> bit off a little more than she could chew as she asked a bunch of kids what happens to people when they sleep.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old singer appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live when she was tasked with finding the answer to the question posed by her newly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lizzo-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-among-stars-leading-grammy-2020-nominations-11188592/">Grammy nominated album</a>, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</p>
      <p>But rather than asking, you know, actual scientists, Billie put the question to a group of adorable children and, as expected, they gave some pretty good answers.</p>
      <p>‘You could pretty much go anywhere,’ one imaginative kid called Atticus (obviously), told the Bad Guy singer.</p>
      <p>‘Like the desert, India, the West times or the mummy times, or dinosaur times, or prehistoric times.’</p>
      <p>Too cute!</p>

      <p>Some of the kids made Billie into their own personal dream therapist, telling her about their nightmares involving zombies and, erm, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/27/it-chapter-two-director-reveals-surprisingly-huge-runtime-for-pennywise-return-10472773/">Pennywise the Clown</a>.</p>

      <p>Seriously, who is reading <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stephen-king/">Stephen King</a>’s It to under 10s? Who thought that was a good idea?</p>
      <p>Getting seriously creepy, the little boy told Billie: ‘I’ve seen [Pennywise] in real life, I bought him here. He’s on top of your head.</p>
      <p>‘He’s sitting on your head and eating candy and he’s eating a cat, and a dog, and a duck, and a fox, and a person. And he’s drinking a grandmother. And he’s eating you.’</p>
      <p>While comments like these would definitely leave us fearing for our lives, Billie took it all in her stride, telling the kid: ‘You’re a weird little dude, Michael.’</p>
      <p>Understatement of the year.</p>
