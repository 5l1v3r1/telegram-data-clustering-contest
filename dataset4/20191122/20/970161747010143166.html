      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a> is clearly living her best life, as she has taken herself off to Disneyland following her eight Grammy nods.</p>
      <p>Sporting Minnie Mouse ears and polka dot socks, the Truth Hurts hitmaker threw her hands in the air as she arrived at the magical resort.</p>
      <p>And it looks as though she is having a blast, as she took to Instagram to share her time away.</p>
      <p>‘I’m at the happiest place on earth…’ the 31-year-old said before adding: ‘And I’m at Disneyland.’</p>
      <p>Our hearts just can’t deal!</p>

      <p>Someone else said: ‘I wanna go to Disneyland on the same day LIZZO goes.’ Same girl, same.</p>
      <p>Her post comes after it was announced the star received a whopping eight Grammy nominations including album of the year for Cuz I Love You, best new artist and song of the year for Truth Hurts.</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish followed close behind along with Little Nas X who have scooped six nods each.</p>

      <p>Fans were quick to congratulate the star as they showered him with praise under his post.</p>
      <p>‘Congrats King. I’m so proud of you!!!’ one wrote while another added: ‘GRAMMY NOMINATED NAS IS WHAT THEY CALLIN YOU NOW.’</p>
