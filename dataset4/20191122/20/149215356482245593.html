      <p>That one's gotta hurt.</p>
      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/1197938269092294657">former Vice President Joe Biden announced</a> that he'd earned the endorsement of Oliver Davis Jr., a black community leader in Indiana.

      <p>It's hard not to read that as a shot at Buttigieg, who is 40 years Biden's junior and has faced major criticism over his lack of political and life experience and <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/879385/pete-buttigiegs-selfinflicted-black-voter-problem">dismal showing</a> among black voters. And if that weren't enough of a blow, Biden was sure to point out that Davis "joins two other African American elected officials from Indiana" in backing Biden as well.</p>
