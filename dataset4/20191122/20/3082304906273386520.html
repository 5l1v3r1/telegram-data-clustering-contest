        <b>Despite rumours linking him with a return to Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola insists he has no plans to move back to the Bundesliga giants yet</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has no immediate plans to swap Manchester City for a return to his former club Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Bayern are on the search for a new coach after sacking Niko Kovac earlier in November.</p>
      <p>Hans-Dieter Flick is currently interim coach, while Mauricio Pochettino – who was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday – has been linked with a switch to the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga champions are also rumoured to be interested in moving for City boss Guardiola, who spent three seasons at Bayern between 2013 and 2016 before taking over at City.</p>
      <p>However, Guardiola has insisted Bayern are aware he is a person who respects his contracts, adding he wishes to stay at City as long as the club want him to remain.</p>
      <p>“When these things appear, is it the media or the club? We don’t know. It could be one guy [starting a rumour] and then people take it,” Guardiola told Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>“I like the people from Bayern a lot. I was incredibly happy there, but they know I’m a guy that respects what I sign.</p>
      <p>“In football, when you are not getting results you can be sacked but in this case if the club [Manchester City] wants me, I want to stay here.</p>

      <p>“It doesn’t matter if Bayern want me or not in the future. My love for the city, the club and the people I met there is incredible.</p>
      <p>“It is the same in Barcelona because it is my hometown, but the same happened here. I have more things to do.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola acknowledged he will not remain at City forever, but insists it is the memories created at clubs that form the best legacies.</p>
      <p>“That is the real legacy that you like, more than lifting titles,” Guardiola said. “You remember the places for the people you live with, not for the museums or cathedrals.</p>
      <p>“I will not be here [at Manchester City] forever. It’s important when you leave that you can come back and be happy with the people.”</p>
      <p>Under Guardiola, City have won successive Premier League titles, two EFL Cups and an FA Cup, as well as two Community Shields.</p>
