            <b>MR-W Vs MS-W Dream11 : Melbourne Stars’ misdemeanour looks set to continue today when they square off against city rivals Melbourne Renegades.</b>
          </p>
          <p>There couldn’t have been a better encounter on this Saturday to regale us in a new round of the engrossing festival weekend of the Women’s Big Bash League than this forthcoming contest between Melbourne Renegades and Melbourne Stars. When both the sides from the same city will be squaring off today, this is a match which looks set to be an intoxicating concoction, a match which will be tightly contested as either side look to emerge on the greener side of the rub from this.</p>
          <p>However, the form that Melbourne Stars carry into today’s clash could end up acting as a determent to a match which has usually been a feisty and fiery one. The side are coming into today’s encounter in completely disarray, a side which has managed to win just the singular match in 10 encounters with their stinker displays seeing them face massive backlash.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>With their journey of making it into the ensuing round all but over, the side’s predicament continued in their last outing as well, a result which perfectly epitomised their peril in this edition of the league. Needing 154 to win against Brisbane Heat, the side ended up faltering at the wrong time, losing a slew of wickets as their run chase completely fell apart with the side losing their way to shambolically collapse 6 runs short of the target at hand.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, Melbourne Stars will be looking to use this fixture as not just a means to triumph in this rivalry but also make massive strides in the points tally. A win takes paramount precedence for them today after being cut short and decimated in ther foregone encounter, a match where they were outplayed with both the bat and ball as they ended up losing by 9 wickets to Perth Scorchers who cruised to the 150 target with ease.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Being the first match of the league to be contested over here, this surface will have something in it for both the batters and bowlers with the ball frisking and misbehaving in the first part but nothing too adversely with strokeplay being relatively easy once you settle into your groove. The side winning the toss here will be looking to come out and bat first and pile on a dicey target for their oppositions. </p>

                            <h3>MR-W Vs MS-W Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>A major reason which ended up acting as a decisive factor in our selection of Josie Dooley from Melbourne Renegades was the fact that she’s extremely likely to come out and bat today. Her side’s top-order is always vulnerable to a collapse, one which should see her being accorded with ample deliveries to pile on a flurry of runs given her traits as a bat. </p>
                            <h3>MRW Vs MSW Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>Despite Melbourne Stars making for such an abject, appalling and callous viewing this season, the side have got three bats who have continued waging a lone battle for the side. We are going to venture in with the entire trivalent for today’s encounter, names who’ll be looking to rescue the side from the misdemeanour of yet another defeat against their bitter rivals.</p>
                            <p>After scoring 59 runs in the side’s last outing, a knock which saw her side remain in the run chase for as long as plausible, the side’s opener, Elyse Villani is the first name to be inducted into our Dream 11 unit. She is accompanied by Lizelle Lee whose 24 runs saw the two stitch together a 50 run partnership for the opening wicket for the side.</p>
                            <p>Her South African counterpart, Mignon du Preez comes in as well after scoring 38 runs in the same encounter while from the other side we have gone in with the singular pick of Jess Duffin.</p>
                            <h3>MR-W Vs MS-W Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>With 40 runs in the opening slot the last time around, Danielle Wyatt showed that she’s the custodian and watchdog of her side’s batting order. The player plied her skill set with the bat astutely to prove her wroth once again with a pleasing to the eye display which saw her cover herself in glory. </p>
                            <p>The second opener of Melbourne Renegades, Sophie Molineux will be accompanying her for the clash while from the other side of the facet we have made Madeline Penna our choice for this segment.</p>
                            <h3>MR-W Vs MS-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Given how despondent and sorry Melbourne stars have been in their batting sorties, our entire trio in this slot is comprised of picks from Melbourne Renegades. We begin with Georgia Wareham who returned with figures of 2-27 from the last encounter, pairing her up with Maitlan Brown who snagged 1-18 in the same match to disrupt the opposition from piling on a big score.</p>
                            <p>Her four overs for a mere 19 runs in the same tie see us wrap up our side with Lea Tahuhu from the unit.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Wyatt comes into our outfit as the captain whilst Sophie is our vice-captain.</p>
