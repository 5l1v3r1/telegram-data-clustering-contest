      <p>On Wednesday, investors were introduced to some volatility as trade-war worries escalated. However, those fears didn’t follow through much on Thursday or Friday, as the indices were relatively calm. Here’s a look at a few top stock trades to get ready for next week.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Gap (GPS)</h3>

      <p>After <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/gap-earnings-boost-gps-stock/">earnings yesterday</a>, <b>Gap</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/gps-stock-quote/"><b><u>GPS</u></b></a>) started today’s trading by dropping, but the stock rebounded and moved higher on Friday.</p>
      <p>By rebounding in the manner that it did, GPS stock cemented a level of support worth keeping an eye on. That comes into play at $16. That was roughly the low from Thursday, too, and a look at the daily chart reveals the significance of this mark over the past few months.</p>
      <p>Bulls who are long GPS need to see shares hold up over this mark. Below can usher in more selling, potentially down to the 52-week low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are current resistance. Above those marks and a run to $19 is possible.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Tesla (TSLA)</h3>

      <p>How interesting has <b>Tesla</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tsla-stock-quote/"><b><u>TSLA</u></b></a>) been in 2019? On Thursday evening, the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/heres-why-the-tesla-cybertruck-has-its-crazy-look/">introduced</a> its new pickup, the Cybertruck. To say the reviews have been mixed so far would be putting it kindly.</p>
      <p>With less than an hour left in the session, shares were down more than 6%. Above is a weekly chart, which does not show the 20-day moving average. However, if it were shown above, you’d see TSLA stock knifing through this mark at $335.65.</p>
      <p>If bulls can reclaim this mark and stabilize the stock price, then perhaps a rebound can ensue. Over $360 puts $380 on the table. However, this stock went up $100 per share in just a few weeks — an unwind should be expected to some degree.</p>
      <p>If we get a larger pullback, it’s important to give TSLA stock time to settle down and see where support comes into play. Is that near former channel resistance (purple line)? How about around $310, a post-earnings consolidation zone?</p>
      <p>There are too many question marks with this chart, but one thing is clear: Tesla stock made a pivotal move on Friday, and that means it needs time to digest that move.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Splunk (SPLK)</h3>

      <p><b>Splunk</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/splk-stock-quote/"><b><u>SPLK</u></b></a>) stock is exploding higher, up about 10% after <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/splunk-earnings-send-splk-stock-up/">better-than-expected earnings</a>. However, shares are running into a tough area of resistance.</p>
      <p>This mark comes into play between $140 to $142.50. Over this mark and SPLK stock can break out. Should resistance hold steady, we need to see where SPLK stock firms up on a pullback.</p>
      <p>Below Friday’s low and a move down to $128 is possible. Let’s see if we can get a shallow pullback and/or a sideways consolidation before pushing through resistance.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: J.M. Smucker (SJM)</h3>

      <p>In September, <b>J.M. Smucker</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/sjm-stock-quote/"><b><u>SJM</u></b></a>) broke out over downtrend resistance (blue line). However, that didn’t kickstart a huge bullish breakout. Instead, shares continued to tread water until reporting earnings on Friday.</p>
      <p>The move initially sent shares up to $113, launching the stock over another downtrend resistance mark (purple line) and all of its major moving averages. Man, it <i>looked</i> like a powerful move was being made.</p>
      <p>However, SJM stock couldn’t stick the landing, giving up a bulk of its gains on the day. Over the 200-day moving average and SJM is a “cleaner” long than it is down here. Below the 50-day moving average and $102 support is on deck.</p>
