      <h1>Judge allows Covington teenager to continue $275M libel lawsuit against NBC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:42:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>A judge <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/covington-catholic-teen-nbc-suit-judge">gave</a> Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann the green light to continue in his $275 million libel lawsuit against NBC, according to court documents.</p>
      <p>Sandmann became the center of racial controversy after a video of him smirking in front of a Native American man while wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., went viral in January. The teen was labeled as racist in news coverage from several major outlets, including the <i>Washington Post</i>, CNN, and NBC. It was later revealed that Sandmann had done nothing wrong and that circulating videos did not account for the full timeline of events.</p>
      <p>The Kentucky teenager’s attorneys filed multi-million-dollar lawsuits against several newsrooms, including a $275 million libel lawsuit against NBCUniversal. NBC tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, but a judge denied their request on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The judge explained that NBC had falsely reported that Sandmann “blocked” Nathan Phillips, the Native American man in the photograph, and “did not allow him to retreat.” Given that the reports were false, they could be libelous, as well.</p>
      <p>Sandmann’s attorney, L. Lin Wood, announced that the judge ruled the lawsuit could continue to discovery, tweeting, “As predicted, today Judge Bertelsman entered an order allowing the Nicholas Sandmann case against NBCUniversal to proceed to discovery just as he had earlier ruled with respect to WaPo &amp; CNN cases. Huge, huge win!”</p>

      <p>As Wood noted, a judge overruled a lower court decision from July that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/judge-tosses-covington-catholic-students-defamation-lawsuit-against-washington-post">let the lawsuit</a> against the <i>Washington Post</i> be dismissed, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/judge-revives-covington-catholic-students-libel-suit-against-washington-post">allowing Sandmann to continue</a> with his $250 million libel lawsuit against the newspaper.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Post</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-post-issues-lengthy-correction-over-covington-catholic-confrontation">issued a lengthy correction</a> of its reporting of the encounter between Sandmann and Phillips in March, two months after their first reports.</p>
