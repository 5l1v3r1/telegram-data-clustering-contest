      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-friday-headphones-deals-how-and-where-to-find-the-biggest-bargains">Black Friday</a> is officially a week away, but that hasn't stopped the major retailers from starting their sales now.</p>
      <p>These Sony WH-XB900N <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-best-wireless-headphones-you-can-buy-right-now">wireless</a> <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-best-noise-cancelling-headphones-you-can-buy-right-now">noise cancelling</a> <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-friday-headphones-deals-how-and-where-to-find-the-biggest-bargains">headphones</a> are a bridge between the company’s Extra Bass series and their premium WH-1000XM3 cans. With overpowering bass., balanced mids and detailed highs, an impressive battery life (30 hours on a single charge with noise cancellation enabled and for 35 hours without it), it's the best of both worlds.</p>
