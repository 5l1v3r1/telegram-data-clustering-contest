      <h1>Tom Brady explains why he's always disliked Cowboys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:16:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Patriots are preparing for what should be an epic matchup with the Cowboys on Sunday, with both teams continuing along on their respective quests for a division title, and tons of playoff implications on the line.</p>
      <p>Neither team really needs any added motivation for the game, given what’s at stake. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady sure doesn’t, as he’s actually disliked the Cowboys, since, well, forever.</p>
      <p>“I’ve really not liked the Cowboys since coming out of the womb,” Brady <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/patriots/2019/11/21/patriots-tom-brady-disliked-cowboys-since-womb/4259864002/">said</a>, via USA Today Sports.</p>
      <p>He then continued on about the matchup:</p>
      <p>Brady quickly added, “I’ve got a lot of respect for (the Cowboys). They’ve had a great, winning organization, and a lot of great players in their history.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a huge challenge for us. I love the opportunity to compete against great teams this time of year, as Thanksgiving approaches. It means a lot for both teams.”</p>
      <p>Yeesh. 42 years is a long time to hold a grudge, Tom</p>
