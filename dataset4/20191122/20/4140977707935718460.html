          </p>
          <p>Unstoppable, unforgiving, relentless and ruthless, Los Angeles Lakers have been firm to make this the season when the side finally end up unlocking the true potential of their outfit. After an underachieving and irresponsible foregone campaign, the team have done extremely well to work on their gameplan and overhaul their floundering form to emerge as an unbeatable and stanch outfit to sit in the echelons of the Western Conference.</p>
          <p>Currently carrying the best winning spree in the league, the side come into today’s encounter with a 12-2 record being a testament to their emphatic and pulsating brand of basketball. The come into today’s contest having trounced and thumped today’s opponent only in their bygone contest with a 112-107 win over Oklahoma City Thunder emphasising the exuberance of star performers in the outfit.</p>

                <p>It’s a performance they’ll be looking to reverberate come their second match in succession against Oklahoma City Thunder, a side for whom the previous defeat was their ninth loss in 14 fixtures. It saw them slump to 12th position in the points tally, a precarious and perilous position which has left them in a predicament with the side left bereft of ideas of how to wrench out of their impasse.</p>
                <p>The side have lost two straight contests and with today’s clash against Los Angeles Lakers looking extremely improbable for them to win, the side know they’ll need to divulge deep into their repertoire of resources to win this one. This looks set to be a foregone conclusion in favour of the visiting side but with Oklahoma coming to home solace for this one, the side will be immensely buoyed by their rapturous support to make this a ripper of a contest. </p>

                            <h3>OKC Vs LAL Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>If the home side are going to have any chance of emerging winners from this encounter, they’ll be requiring Dennis Schroder to be at the pinnacle of his skill set. The point guard will be required to traverse through the opposition’s defence and layup the ball for his counterparts immaculately, something he’s well equipped to dole out to see us opt for him for this contest.</p>
                            <h3>OKC Vs LAL Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>Oklahoma City Thunder’s leading run getter, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander comes into our side as the shooting guard for this match up. The player’s scrimmages have seen him tally up 19.4 points per encounter, a number he’ll be needing to emulate come today’s encounter and try to engage Los Angeles Lakers in is titillating gameplan.</p>
                            <h3>OKC Vs LAL Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>With 11.1 assists per match, LeBron James becomes the first player to make an advent into our Dream 11 setup. The player faced massively flak and backlash for his performances in the foregone season but the transfers the side have gotten in this time around have seen him dole out some solid performances to see us move in for the player for today.</p>
                            <p>He will be accompanied by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope not only owing to his meagre price tag of 5.5 credits and his gargantuan involvement on the court but also the stellar performances he’s doled to persistently.</p>
                            <h3>OKC Vs LAL Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>A major reason for his side’s consummate success, the visiting side’s Anthony Davies has been at the forefront of his team’s sensational displays. The player has ended up accumulating 25.2 points per match but more importantly his 9 rebounds per match have seen him ensure the side’s layups and second chances have converted fruitfully into points for the outfit.</p>
                            <p>Jared Dudley will be his partner for the day for this one whilst from the other side of the segment we have decided to indulge in the services of Abdel Nader as our cheap pick given his succulent showings.</p>
                            <h3>OKC Vs LAL Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>JaVale McGee is our singular pick in this slot of our Dream 11 side to wrap up proceedings for us for this imminent tie. The player has latched and lunged onto defections and rebounds to play a two toned role as a player by pulling off blocks and steals to rope in consistent points for the side.</p>
                            <h3>OKC Vs LAL Dream11 Star Player</h3>
                            <p>Davies has always remained our side’s captain when he’s featuring and the player continues to hold down his spot.</p>
