      <p>NORMAN — Oklahoma was already beating Maryland Eastern Shore by 25 points on Thursday night, but the final two points of the game were special to the Sooners.</p>
      <p>Read Streller, a three-year walk-on, was fouled with less than a minute left in the game, and went to the line to shoot free throws. As Streller sunk the first one, the Sooners' bench erupted in excitement, and freshman Victor Iwuakor ran up behind Streller and gave him a hug.</p>
      <p>It was the first point Streller had scored as a Sooner.</p>
      <p>He made the second free throw and got the same joyous reaction from his teammates. Streller's two free throws added to the Sooners' 91-64 win over the Hawks.</p>
      <p>"That was awesome," junior Brady Manek said. "He’s been here two years. He’s been an awesome teammate for us. I live with him, so I see him all the time. My boy, Big Read. It’s awesome, for him and his family. He knocked them down like it was nothing."</p>
      <p>From Edmond, Streller is a product of Oklahoma Christian School. Thursday's game was his second appearance in a game this season.</p>
