      <h1>Ex-Newcastle keeper Harper joins Steve Bruce's staff</h1>
      <h2>Former Newcastle goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-harper/"><b>Steve Harper</b></a> has returned to the club as part of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-bruce/"><b>Steve Bruce</b></a>'s backroom team.</h2>

      <p>Harper, acknowledged by the Magpies as their "all-time longest-serving player" having spent 20 years at St James' Park from 1993 to 2013, is set to stay on as Northern Ireland goalkeeping coach for the time being.</p>
      <p>It was Bruce who tempted the Newcastle stalwart away when he signed him for Hull, where Harper's new coaching colleagues Stephen Clemence and Steve Agnew were part of the set-up.</p>
      <p>With Simon Smith already employed as head of goalkeeping, Harper's role as first-team coach will involve linking the senior and academy set-ups.</p>
      <p>Harper, who has worked with the youth sides on a part-time basis in the past, told NUFC TV: "I'm looking forward to it. The manager said to me he'd like me to come in with a role around the first team, but more than just that.</p>
      <p>"I'll officially be a first-team coach, but with a conduit for keeping an eye on, and almost as a link to, the under-23s, who I worked with last season, and the academy where I've worked in various capacities over the last three years. So it made sense, and I'm looking forward to getting started."</p>
      <p>Bruce added: "He's somebody who I had the pleasure of managing, he went on to do his coaching badges, and he's one of that 'young brigade' who can do a little bit of coaching but, just as importantly, will give us a stronger bridge in between the first team and the academy."</p>
