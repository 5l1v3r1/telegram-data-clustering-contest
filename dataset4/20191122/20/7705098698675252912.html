      <h1>Swamp Thing: The Complete Series Will Hit Blu-Ray In February 2020</h1>

      <p>Even though it didn’t expand beyond one season, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/swamp-thing"><b>Swamp Thing</b></a> will still get to tell his full tale on home video. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment announced that it will bring <b>Swamp Thing: The Complete Series</b> to Blu-Ray on February 11, 2020. Prior to that, the series will get a full digital release on December 2. Those who want to wait will get a digital copy of the complete season alongside the Blu-Ray release.</p>
      <p>James Wan, Mark Verheiden, Gary Dauberman, Michael Clear and Len Wiseman executive produced the series; which was fairly true to the spirit of the <b>Swamp Thing</b> comics.</p>
      <p>“Dr. Abby Arcane finds herself investigating a deadly swamp-born virus in the small town of Maraid, Louisiana. But when a mysterious creature emerges, she finds herself facing nightmares from a supernatural world, where everyone is at risk. As a result, the Swamp Thing may play an unlikely hero.”</p>
      <p><b>Swamp Thing</b> was well received when it streamed on DC Universe. However, Warner Bros. opted to <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/444593-report-swamp-thing-season-1-may-be-cut-down-to-10-episodes">shorten the season</a> before it aired. DC Universe <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/452277-swamp-thing-reportedly-canceled-by-dc-universe">cancelled the series</a> soon thereafter.</p>
