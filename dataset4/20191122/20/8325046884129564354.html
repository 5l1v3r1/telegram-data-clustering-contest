      <p>For some, finding that first <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/gray-hair">gray hair</a> can trigger mild existential dread, but these famous figures might have you embracing the new hue.</p>
      <p>In fact, many of them look <i>better</i> with this more distinguished hair color – which isn’t even that different from the current trends of <a href="https://www.insider.com/platinum-blonde-celebrities-2018-11">going platinum blonde</a> or even <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/25/17887172/grombre-instagram-gray-hair-martha-truslow-smith">“grombre.”</a></p>
      <p>These before and after transformations might convince you to put down the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/hair-dye">hair dye</a> for good.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For the first few decades of her career, Curtis rocked a reddish-brown hue. But starting in the 2000s, she began embracing her graying hair, and has kept it that way.</p>
      <p>“The epiphany came when I was sitting in a hair salon thinking, ‘What the eff am I doing putting a chemical on my head that burns?’,” <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/jamie-lee-curtis-dishes-on-life-after-50/">she told Everyday Health.</a></p>

      <p>“My hair used to be dark, and now it’s salt-and-pepper. I <i>like</i> the way it looks. Luckily it’s still mostly there, so this is easy for me to say, but I would hope that if I lose my hair, I’ll just roll with it,” <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/unexpected-jeff-goldblum">he told GQ</a>. “When you try to be youthful, it only makes you look older,” he continued.</p>

      <p>During a recent stint on “Justified,” Elliott appeared without his mustache and looked almost unrecognizable. “It was fun transforming my look, but I did feel naked without the mustache,” <a href="https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/style-trends/info-2015/sam-elliott-celebrity-news.html">he told AARP in 2015</a>.</p>

I wish I still had brown hair. It’s not my thing.”</p>
      <p>He even compared himself to a White Walker from “<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>,” according to People.</p>
      <p>We beg to differ, Mr. Cooper.</p>
