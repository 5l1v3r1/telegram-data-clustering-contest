      <p>GoMo, the latest mobile brand to come to Ireland, is being slammed by numerous individuals across the country who are extremely unhappy as a result of porting issues and poor customer service.</p>
      <p>Launched by Eir last month, many people flocked to the exclusively online offering, with their promise of unlimited texts and calls, as well as 80GB of mobile data for the first 100,000 customers.</p>
      <p>At present, an age-old saying springs to mind, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
      <p>All you have to do is browse through Boards.ie, the reviews section on the GoMo Ireland Facebook page, Twitter or Trustpilot to witness a slew of complaints from outraged customers.</p>

      <p>One such review on Trustpilot reads:</p>
      <p>“Appalling customer service, SIM card arrived however not my number as requested without phone service for over six weeks.</p>
      <p>“Still no response from GoMo, other than we will contact you in two days, I would not recommend this service.”</p>
      <p>While a second states:</p>
      <p>“Avoid this network. Incredibly poor customer service. The frustration I have had trying to port my number and contact customer service about having a malfunctioning SIM card is actually unbelievable. </p>
      <p>“I ordered my SIM card over one month ago, and still have no service. I have complained to the customer service and asked for the issue to be escalated, only to be fobbed off with a feigned attempt to correct the issues. </p>
      <p>“Being asked for the fifth time if I have turned my phone off and on again is making me feel like I am in an episode of the IT crowd.”</p>
      <p>Writing this today, I must admit I fall within this category of unhappy customers. Why? It is nearing the end of two weeks now since I made the switch from Eir to GoMo.</p>

        <figcaption>Many people were attracted to GoMo's offer of free texts, free calls and 80GB of mobile data for only €9.99 a month</figcaption>

      <p>According to <a href="https://gomo.ie/">GoMo.ie</a>, switching your current phone number to your new GoMo SIM can take up to 24 hours for the process to complete.</p>
      <p>While this works for some, it doesn’t work for others. From countless reviews and my own experience porting can take up to two weeks or longer.</p>
      <p>Since November 8, I have someone else’s active number, to which I have received calls and text messages from people thinking I am someone else.</p>
      <p>It was only the other day I rang my number, the one I want so desperately to be returned to me, and a male voice answered.</p>
      <p>What makes matters worse is trying to get through to GoMo. The customer service is little to none.</p>
      <p>Emails to complaints, messages to a webchat service and social media channels await responses for a long period of time. And the complaints keep building up and up.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for GoMo said to Buzz.ie:</p>
      <p>“A small percentage of new customers may have had an issue porting their old number and this can be managed via MyGoMo.</p>
      <p>“Any customer experiencing a technical issue can get in touch with our team via web chat within MyGoMo who will resolve it.”</p>
      <p>If you are experiencing problems with porting issues and poor customer service the best course of action is to make contact with Ireland’s Communications Regulator ComReg.</p>
      <p>From here ComReg will advise on how to create a formal complaint to GoMo and the mobile brand will then have ten working days to resolve your issue.</p>
      <p>Confirming to Buzz.ie, the Communications Regulator said they “received a number of contacts from consumers regarding GoMo.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson continued:</p>
      <p>“ComReg is monitoring the issues raised by consumers to ComReg and ComReg will engage with GoMo to ensure that complaints are resolved appropriately.</p>
      <p>“Consumers who wish to make a complaint to GoMo should do so in accordance with <a href="https://gomo.ie/code-of-practice/">GoMo’s code of practice</a> in the first instance.”</p>
      <p>ComReg may raise a complaint on behalf of an individual, providing GoMo does not resolve an issue within the time frame stated in their code of practice.</p>
      <p>To make a complaint to ComReg you can do so by visiting the following <a href="https://www.comreg.ie/queries-complaints/got-a-question/">link</a>.</p>
