      <h1>Yellow weather warning in place for southeast ahead of wet weekend</h1>
      <h2>Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Wicklow and Waterford at risk to thundery rain, flooding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:38:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/mark-hilliard-7.3188395" target="_blank">Mark Hilliard</a></address>
      <p>The southeast of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> has been told to brace itself for an extremely wet weekend.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Met+%C3%89ireann">Met Éireann</a>, counties Carlow, Kilkenny, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Wexford">Wexford</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Wicklow">Wicklow</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Waterford">Waterford</a> all risk exposure to thundery rain and flooding. A yellow weather warning, the lowest in severity, has been put in place until Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>For everyone else, Saturday is expected to be cloudy with scattered showers, particularly in the morning in the east. The west of the country should enjoy a brighter day although temperatures everywhere are only likely to climb as high as 10 degrees.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, in the Dublin area, things do not look promising for the week ahead – a snapshot of weather apps shows seven days of persistent rain and temperatures barely edging into double figures.</p>
      <p>From Sunday, forecasters believe outbreaks of rain in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Munster">Munster</a> area will begin in the morning and spread to the north east during the day. The heaviest rain is likely to hit coastal counties in the east and south.</p>
      <p>By Tuesday, the picture remains uncertain although rain, heavy in places, is expected to move eastwards over the southern half of the country, although with drier conditions in the north.</p>
      <p>Rain has become a familiar part of daily life recently. On Friday, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Dublin+Bus">Dublin Bus</a> said it was experiencing problems due to heavy traffic “exacerbated by the weather”.</p>
      <p>The Airport Hopper bus service said it too was experiencing a one hour delay during the afternoon due to heavy <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=M50">M50</a> traffic and weather conditions.</p>
