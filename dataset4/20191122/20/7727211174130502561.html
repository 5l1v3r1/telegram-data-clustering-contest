      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/national-lottery-euromillions-set-huge-16446095">The EuroMillions draw</a> takes place every Tuesday and Friday, a ticket costs £2.50 and includes automatic entry into the UK Millionaire Maker draw, which creates new UK millionaires every week, guaranteed.</p>
      <p>The jackpot can rise to €190million (approximately £167million).</p>
      <p>If it reaches this level, it will be capped - if the jackpot is not won, any additional money in the jackpot prize fund over and above €190 million will roll down to boost the prize money at the next highest tier where there are winners (most likely the 5+1 tier).</p>
      <p>This can happen four times before the €190 million must be won.</p>
      <p>If this happens and the jackpot is still not won, the entire €190 million - plus any additional money in the jackpot prize fund over and above this amount - would roll down to the next highest tier where there are winners (most likely the 5+1 tier).</p>
