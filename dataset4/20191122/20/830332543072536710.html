      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Wisconsin wildlife officials say chronic wasting disease has spread to Dunn County.</p>
      <p>The Department of Natural Resources said Friday that a wild deer killed during the 2019 archery season near Menomonie has tested positive for the disease. The infection is the first detected in Dunn County.</p>
      <p>Five wild deer have tested positive for CWD in neighboring Eau Claire County over the last two years.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin's traditional nine-day gun deer season opens Saturday. DNR officials are asking hunters in northwestern Wisconsin to turn in samples from any deer they kill in the region for CWD testing. A list of sampling stations can be found on the DNR's website at https://dnr.wi.gov/wmcwd/RegStation/Search.</p>
