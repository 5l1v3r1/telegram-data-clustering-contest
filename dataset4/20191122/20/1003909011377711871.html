      <h1>Toews: Union attack on Alberta's pension plans is 'absolute nonsense'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:37:50+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author">Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, a number of Alberta’s <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-hands-off-our-retirement-funds-say-alberta-union-leaders">union bosses</a> attempted to portray the provincial government’s recent pension plan proposals as “an attack on the pension security of hundreds of thousands of Albertans.”</p>
      <p>This is absolute nonsense and I want to set the record straight.</p>
      <p>As part of Budget 2019, the government of Alberta has made the Alberta Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo) the investment manager of all public sector pensions, including the Alberta Teachers’ Retirement Fund. The fact is, AIMCo was already managing every public sector pension fund except the ATRF. We are keeping the investments within AIMCo for the long term. It is curious that union leaders whose investments are currently managed by AIMCo would be concerned.</p>
      <p>AIMCo has earned its reputation as a world-class investment manager, with $108 billion under management. It is, among other things, the investment manager of Alberta’s Heritage Trust Fund. And it regularly achieves spectacular investment performance — over the past 10 years, AIMCo has provided an annual return of 9.9 per cent on Albertans’ investments. That might be reason enough to move Alberta’s public sector pension plan investments to AIMCo. But the case is, in fact, better than that.</p>
      <p>The broader use of AIMCo reflects our commitment to make government more efficient and ensure the best use of taxpayer dollars. In the case of the ATRF, it is estimated that this measure will result in an annual savings of $41 million for the teachers’ pension plan, or almost $500 for every teacher that contributes to the fund. These savings, which were previously wasted on administration costs, will now be directed towards the health of the plan. For a teacher who retires 35 years from now, the compound value of the investment management savings upon retirement is estimated to be $78,471. These savings are doubled when one considers the fact that taxpayers, as the employer, make half the contributions to the plan.</p>
      <p>“But wait,” say the union bosses, “the UCP wants to control the billions … that individual Albertans have been saving for their own retirements.” Let me be clear. AIMCo operates independently and at arm’s-length from the government. Control remains firmly in the hands of each pension board. Boards will continue to retain ownership of the plan’s assets<b><i>. Most importantly, there will be no changes to pension benefits. </i></b>The only thing that is changing is the investment manager of the funds.</p>
      <p>This is a win-win for public sector pension members and taxpayers alike.</p>
      <p>But the scaremongering doesn’t end there. Union bosses also oppose looking into the possibility of leaving the Canada Pension Plan in favour of a made-in-Alberta solution.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, the premier recently appointed the Fair Deal Panel to consult Albertans on how best to protect our economic interests within Confederation.</p>
      <p>One of the issues that the panel will examine is whether we would be better off with an Alberta Pension Plan as opposed to the current Canada Pension Plan.</p>
      <p>Why would we look at making this change? According to a recent study by the Fraser Institute, Albertans make a disproportionate contribution to the CPP. In 2017, we put in $2.9 billion more in contributions than we received in benefits. Over the last decade (2008-2017), Albertans made a cumulative net contribution of $27.9 billion to the CPP.</p>
      <p>It’s estimated that under an APP, Albertans’ pension payroll tax could fall to 5.85 per cent of earnings from the current 9.9 per cent — all the while maintaining the same level of benefits. That would leave more money for taxpayers and stimulate economic growth in the province.</p>
      <p>And yet, the unions oppose even studying it. Why?</p>
      <p>Why do they oppose innovation? Why do they oppose efficiency? Why do they oppose saving taxpayers’ hard-earned money?</p>
      <p>Our government is committed to ensuring that Albertans get the most out of their pensions. That means finding savings where we can, lowering contribution rates if possible and maintaining or increasing benefits. We were elected to be fiscally responsible — and that is exactly what we are doing.</p>
