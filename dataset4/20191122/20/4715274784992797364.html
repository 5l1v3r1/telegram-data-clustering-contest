      <p>Now called Christmas Animated Display, the show at the Times Square Food Park, which is just a stone’s throw away from its original location, focuses on the stories of five important figures of the Yuletide season, namely, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus, and the Nativity. </p>
      <p>Each scene in the animated display features a beautiful backdrop and familiar characters that provide plenty of colors.</p>
      <p>Araneta City first staged the Christmas on Display in 1966 and has since become a prominent attraction in the country’s premier lifestyle hub during Christmas until the Manila C.O.D. Department Store ceased operations in 2002. </p>
      <p>The Christmas Animated Display is showcased in 15-minute shows from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Sundays to Thursdays, and from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Fridays to Saturdays until Jan. 5. Admission is free to the public.</p>
      <p>Aside from the Christmas Animated Display, the Times Square Food Park also hosts various side activities. There are fun rides and booths, as well as a synthetic skating rink. There’s also a variety of dining options.</p>
