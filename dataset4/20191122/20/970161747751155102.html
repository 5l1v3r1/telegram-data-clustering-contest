        <b>Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) has taken the brave step of opening up to his family about what has happened to him in Coronation Street. Abused at the hands of his depraved stepfather Kel (Joseph Alessi) as a teenager, Paul was groomed into believing it was a loving relationship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Kel’s true colours well and truly exposed, Bernie Winter (Jane Hazelgrove) discovered that her partner was behind the recent burglaries and also discovered evidence including photos of his his sex crimes.</p>
      <p>As Paul took the brave step of opening up to Bernie and Gemma (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dolly-rose-campbell/">Dolly-Rose Campbell</a>) about the abuse he had suffered, Gemma urged him to speak to the police – but while he insisted he would rather die than relive it all, Bernie was heading to the police station, evidence in hand.</p>
      <p>But what happens next?</p>
      <h3>Kel is arrested</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Following Bernie’s actions, Paul is horrified with her for going to the police without speaking to her first. And, as Kel is taken in by police for the burglaries and the allegations of abuse, he faces tough questioning.</p>
      <p>But it might not be as easy as Bernie hoped to have him locked away.</p>
      <h3>Bernie is taken hostage</h3>

      <p>Kel is furious with Bernie for shopping him to the police and he turns up back at the house to confront her, in an angry and volatile state. As a showdown ensues, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/coronation-street-spoilers-paedophile-kel-holds-bernie-hostage-sex-crimes-exposed-11176296/">he locks the door and holds her hostage</a> as she tries to fight back.</p>
      <p>With Bernie terrified of what Kel is capable of, Paul and Bernie will rush to the rescue and save her in time. But has Kel sealed his own fate?</p>
      <h3>Paul and Billy get stronger</h3>
      <p>Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) was the first person that Paul felt able to confide in and as Paul makes the decision over what to do for the best, Billy is proud of his strength and the couple are a tower of support for one another.</p>
      <p>With Billy being there for Paul, Paul sets about putting together a gesture to prove to Billy just how much he means to him.</p>
      <h3>Chesney and Bernie attack Kel</h3>
      <p>When it seems like Kel might evade justice for his crimes, Bernie takes matters into her own hands and heads to the place of his work and starts outing him as a padeophile. When Kel angrily has it out with her, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/coronation-street-spoilers-bernie-winter-chesney-brown-publicly-attack-sex-abuser-kel-truth-revealed-10893444/">Chesney intervenes and hits him</a>.</p>

      <p>But the violent altercation could have negative effects on Paul’s case against him…</p>
      <h3>Kel is trapped in a child sex sting</h3>
      <p>Determined to prove that Kel hasn’t changed, Bernie will set up a secret account as an underage teenage boy and lure Kel into a trap. While Gemma and Paul lie in wait, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/coronation-street-spoilers-paedophile-kel-hinchley-caught-in-child-sex-sting-11076134/">Bernie live films Kel as he comes to the woods to meet with the 14-year-old.</a></p>
      <p>He scarpers but he leaves behind a bag containing alcohol and condoms. Combined with Bernie’s video footage, will this be enough to topple him?</p>
      <h3>Kel will exit</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Sorry, this video isn't available any more.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how Coronation Street plan to bring this story to a close and whether Paul will get the justice he deserves but Joseph <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/coronation-street-spoilers-kel-actor-joe-alessi-confirms-exit-paul-foreman-sex-abuse-twist-takes-horrific-turn-10860048/">has previously confirmed that his stay in Corrie is for the duration of the storyline only</a> – so expect 2020 to herald Kel’s last appearance.</p>
      <p>The actor said: ‘The character I’m playing is finite, I’ll never be a regular on Corrie that’s sure. My role will come to an end.’</p>
