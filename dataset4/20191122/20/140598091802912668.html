      <h1>Great Britain overcome Andy Murray absence to reach Davis Cup semi-finals as Dan Evans finally enjoys win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:27:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/simon-briggs/" target="_blank">Simon Briggs</a></address>
      <p>Great Britain face the ultimate test in Saturday's Davis Cup semi-final: Rafael Nadal and his Spanish amigos, lining up in front of a passionate home crowd at the Caja Magica. But whatever happens, this has already been a triumphant campaign.</p>
      <p>What a performance Leon Smith’s produced on Friday at the Caja Magica. To leave Andy Murray out on fitness grounds, and still beat Germany by a comprehensive 2-0 margin, underlines the fact that tennis in Britain is no longer a Murray-centric monoculture.</p>
      <p>It was Dan Evans who sent Britain through, turning around what had previously been a demoralising week for him personally. He was up against a far bigger hitter in Jan-Lennard Struff – a man who stands seven inches taller and possesses a blunderbuss of a serve.</p>
      <p>But Evans came up with some wonderful pinpoint tennis in the decisive tie-break, claiming a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 victory that he will surely rank among the finest moments of his career. He whirled his arms at the end in delirious celebration, looking as chuffed as a small boy on his first visit to the fairground as he charged towards Smith for a celebratory hug.</p>
      <p>"It's great,” said Evans afterwards. “I lost some tough matches just lately [against Robin Haase on Wednesday and Alexander Bublik on Thursday, after leading by a set each time]. I felt like I had let the team down the last two days. So to come back and get it like that, it's amazing.”</p>

      <p>The rewards, in a monetary sense, will be substantial: £1.1m to be shared between the team, and £585,000 for the Lawn Tennis Association. But the honour of reaching a Davis Cup semi-final is a far bigger prize.</p>
      <p>Great Britain have thus outperformed their world ranking of No. 5, and all without their most famous player. Murray’s absence is not thought to be related to any serious injury, just a slow return to match-readiness after a month away from competitive tennis.</p>
      <p>It seems unlikely that this setback will affect Murray’s build-up to next season in Australia. But he has clearly miscalculated how long it would take him to spring back into optimal shape after the birth of his son Teddy – and a diet which, by his own account, featured too many chocolate biscuits and pieces of cake. “Where Kyle and Evo are at is ahead of where Andy's just now,” said Smith after the tie. “I wouldn’t say he’s in his best condition.”</p>
      <p>In the absence of Murray, Edmund played the No 2 spot for Great Britain, and made the perfect start as he overpowered Philipp Kohlschreiber by a 6-3, 7-5 scoreline. This was Edmund’s second dominant performance in as many days, showing that he has moved on mentally from the eight straight losses that he suffered between August and October.</p>

      <p>Smith hinted on Friday night that he would stick with the same line-up for the Spanish showdown. When the Nadal question was raised, he replied “How do you prepare for Rafa? Like any other match. He's not exactly got many weaknesses. So it's more about you. For example, if Evo's going out, get him in the best head space to go and be able to put his game on the court.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, if the Davis Cup’s organisers wanted to prove that the players still care about the event in its revamped format, they could do worse than to run a film of yesterday’s Serbian press conference on a permanent loop outside the stadium.</p>

      <p>The joint interview took place a little over an hour after Novak Djokovic and Viktor Troicki had wasted three match points in the decisive doubles rubber against Russia. There had clearly been tears shed in the locker-room, after Serbia’s resulting quarter-final exit, and they flowed again in front of the media.</p>
      <p>Troicki took the loss particularly badly because, on the second of those match points, he should have put away a straightforward volley. “I probably feel the worst ever,” he said, while holding his head in his hands. “I never experienced such a moment in my career, in my life. And I let my team down, and I apologise to them.”</p>
