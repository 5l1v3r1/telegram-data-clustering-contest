      <p>(OZARK, Ala.) — An Alabama jury has found a white police officer guilty of manslaughter for the <a href="https://time.com/5731676/shooting-walmart-duncan-oklahoma/">fatal shooting</a> of an unarmed black man in 2016.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that a jury returned the guilty verdict against Montgomery police officer Aaron Cody Smith for the shooting death of 58-year-old Gregory Gunn.</p>
      <p>Smith shot and killed Gunn after he fled from a random stop-and-frisk. The defense maintain that Smith fired in self-defense because Gunn was grabbing a painter’s pole from a porch, but prosecutors say Gunn was never a threat.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors had charged Smith with murder. Jurors returned the guilty verdict on the lesser charge of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>The trial was moved from Montgomery to Ozark, about 85 miles (135 kilometers) away, because of publicity.</p>
