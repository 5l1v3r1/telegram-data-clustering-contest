      <p>Toby Alderweireld could consider making a U-turn over his Tottenham Hotspur future following the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/jose-mourinho-admits-has-learned-past-mistakes-says-spurs-can/">arrival of Jose Mourinho as manager.</a></p>
      <p>Central defender Aldweireld was ready to see out the final six months of his contract and walk out of Spurs on a free transfer before Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino this week.</p>
      <p>The Belgian felt he needed a new challenge away from Spurs, but it is understood he feels reinvigorated by the appointment of Mourinho, who wanted to sign him for Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Mourinho eventually wants to rebuild Tottenham’s defence, but would prefer to do so around Alderweireld rather than pushing him out.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is prepared to open talks over a new deal for Alderweireld, who can start<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/07/26/have-europes-top-clubs-decided-against-bargain-summer-25mtoby/"> talking to foreign clubs</a> in January, or meet the Belgian’s demands.</p>
      <p>But the 30-year-old is now more open to the prospect of reopening contract negotiations and is no longer discounting the prospect of staying at Spurs past the end of this season.</p>

      <p>Other than wanting him at United, Mourinho was also interested in signing Alderweireld for Chelsea and considers him one of the best central defenders in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Alderweireld can expect to play a key role under Mourinho while he is still at Tottenham, but it remains to be seen whether the arrival of the Portuguese will change the situations of Jan Vertonghen or Christian Eriksen.</p>
      <p>The pair are also entering the final six months of their contracts and Vertonghen is two years older than Alderweireld. Eriksen made it clear that he wanted to leave Tottenham in the summer and Mourinho has plenty of other midfield and attacking options.</p>
      <p>Asked about Alderweireld, Vertonghen and Eriksen, Mourinho said: “I’ve had no time to look at individual cases. The first thing for me is for the players to feel good and if they are going to leave in January or June or sign a new contract, I think all of that is based on feeling good and to feel good is to be ready and available on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Jan cannot do that because of injury. But they have to be ready for the team. Then it is about the club, it is about them, it is about me, it is about Mr Levy but fundamentally it is about the players being happy.”</p>
