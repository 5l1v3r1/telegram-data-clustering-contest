      <p>The 56-year-old was appointed Spurs boss on Wednesday, replacing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, and he has since added five new coaches to his backroom team, including two from the French side.</p>
      <p>Highly-rated coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joao-sacramento/"><b>Joao Sacramento</b></a> has been appointed as Mourinho's assistant, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nuno-santos/"><b>Nuno Santos</b></a> has arrived as the new goalkeeping coach at the North London club.</p>
      <p>Galtier criticised the moves in an interview with <i>RMC Sport</i>, sarcastically saying: "It's really classy. Really classy to act like that."</p>
      <p>The former Saint-Etienne coach was appointed Lille manager in December 2017 and he won the Ligue 1 Manager of the Year award last season after guiding the North French club to second place in the league behind Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
