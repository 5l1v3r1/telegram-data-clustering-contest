      <p>It’s pretty frustrating traveling the country, going to once proud, handsome places that polling, surveys, election results and what’s in front of your own eyes suggests have been “left behind”.</p>
      <p>That’s how we felt visiting Hartlepool today but you could replace that town for so many other places around the country.</p>
      <p>“Frustrating” because it’s been obvious for aeons these places want some cash and care.</p>
      <p>Do some casual googling and you’ll come across a piece on how the port is struggling from the year 2000. If I lived in Hartlepool, I would be hopping mad.</p>

      <p>We’re here because it looks to be <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/nigel-farage/"><b>Nigel Farage’s</b></a> Brexit Party's number one target and so it has received a heck of a lot of attention.</p>
      <p>So much attention they are all a bit over it.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes in a pub last night and I had been asked twice: “You’re not going to make one of THOSE pieces about us are you?”</p>
      <p>I supposed they meant – Hartlepool, Brexit Hotbed. I said I’d try not to.</p>
      <p>Farage has put a lot of elbow grease into Hartlepool – it’s where they announced their decision not to contest Tory held seats and we’re told Nigel Farage is heading here tomorrow.</p>
      <p>When we spoke to ITV’s election analyst Colin Rallings, he told us Hartlepool was the party’s “best shot around the country".</p>
      <p>The two Stoke seats too; Great Grimsby, but Hartlepool first and foremost.</p>

            <b>Will the 'volatile voter' be the key to General Election?</b>

            <b>Will Jeremy Corbyn manage to persuade the constituents of Calder Valley to swing red?</b>
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>That’s what Leo Gillen told us too.</p>
      <p>He made political history - poor man - when he stood as the Labour mayoral candidate in 2002 and they elected a monkey rather than Gillen.</p>
      <p>Nearly twenty years on from that political trauma he runs a chain of pubs in the area and so has a very good feel for the place – he believes the town to be on the cusp of turning to the Brexit party.</p>
      <p>He’s still a Labour member and a fervent, lucid supporter of the party just not a Corbynista.</p>
      <p>He believes Labour is struggling because the party, under Jeremy Corbyn, has little to offer a place like Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>Or indeed other towns around the country.</p>
      <p>Analysis by Professor Will Jennings has shown that in the 2017 general election, Labour had a comfortable lead among voters in big cities; that lead shortened in large towns and then in small towns, the Labour party lost out to Conservatives.</p>

        <figcaption>Leo Gillen stood as the Labour mayoral candidate in 2002 and they elected a monkey rather than Gillen.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For him, the current Labour offer – tackling inequality and climate change, with Corbyn in charge and no commitment to Brexit – doesn’t connect with voters in leave towns.</p>
      <p>The Labour party will – with justification – say that their agenda is as relevant to people in towns like Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>Coastal Hartlepool is exactly the place that could benefit from green jobs in off shore wind; better broadband would allow more young people to feel they could be enterprising in their home town.</p>
      <p>Totally fair points.</p>
      <p>Also, the Labour party is now alive to this and has launched efforts to correct the problem with its Labour Towns fund.</p>
      <p>But the polling – and recent local election results - speak for themselves.</p>
      <p>And this unhappiness means it is fertile territory for the Brexit party.</p>
      <p>Even so, the Labour party is very lucky with its voters.</p>
      <p>There are places in the North East that are just so ardently Labour you wonder what Jeremy Corbyn would have to do to lose Labour their support.</p>

        <figcaption>Unhappiness means this is fertile territory for the Brexit party.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>From a day here – I know, really not very much – I am not so certain it will vote in the Brexit party just yet.</p>
      <p>The tireless and charming (and tirelessly charming) team Nathan Lee and Rob Turner went off for two hours surveying the people of Hartlepool while I cut the beginnings of the piece together with Tony Bennison.</p>
      <p>They didn’t find many people who said they would vote for the Brexit Party. Instead most were very, very, staunchly loyal to Labour.</p>
      <p>The opinion polls have shown the Brexit Party being squeezed and ITV's election guru Colin Rallings told us he didn’t think, on current performance, Farage’s army would get a seat come December 13th.</p>
      <p>But what about the Tory party? Why won’t the leave voting North East go Tory?</p>
      <p>Yes, yes, I know about tribal hatred of “Tory scum” but if not now, when?</p>
      <p>There are places (richer places) in the North East that have already gone Conservative – Middlesborough South at the last election.</p>
      <p>Darlington was briefly Tory in the 80s. Stockton South, Conservative until 2017 will probably go Conservative again.</p>
      <p>Bishop Auckland is a high target (though I gather could still prove tricky).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://news.images.itv.com/image/file/2048356/stream_img.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Will there be a wave of votes to the Brexit Party in Hartlepool?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But what about the higher hanging fruit? Tony Blair’s old seat of Sedgefield? Apparently a possible Tory gain but not probable.</p>
      <p>But why not a certain gain?</p>
      <p>These are leave voting places that, having suffered over recent years, you would imagine might be prepared to vote for a party that is at least promising to take them out of the EU.</p>
      <p>Nope. No way.</p>
      <p>Interestingly people mentioned that they liked Kier Starmer up here – I didn’t dare point out that he was on the more Remain end of the Labour party spectrum.</p>
      <p>It reminded me of how much this part of the world enjoyed having a near monopoly on the upper echelons of the Labour party: they loved sharp-suited, power-posing Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and David Miliband.</p>
      <p>But the central fight today is Nigel Farage’s aggressive onslaught on Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>And indeed, with three weeks to go, the place may yet ditch Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party and embrace Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.</p>
      <p>People in Hartlepool do like Farage, he does still seem to have it.</p>
      <p>But does he have 'it' in large enough quantities?</p>
      <p>We gate-crashed a pub quiz at the Jackson Arms and were allowed to lob our own question in.</p>
      <p>Was Hartlepool going to make Nigel Farage “cry or smile” on election night?</p>
      <p>It was a tiny sample of a dozen people but even so, most said they thought he would cry.</p>
