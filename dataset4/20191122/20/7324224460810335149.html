      <p>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May swap the road for the sea in the first trailer for The Grand Tour’s Christmas special.</p>
      <p>The two-minute video for The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen sees the former Top Gear trio embark on a boat trip from Cambodia to Vietnam and further afield.</p>
      <p>At one point, extreme weather forces the presenters to abandon their mission.</p>

      <p>And in another scene, Clarkson can be heard shouting “Oh shit” as he crashes his boat into smaller fishing boats.</p>
      <p>Clarkson chooses a recreation of a Vietnam War-era patrol boat.</p>
      <p>Hammond opts for a Miami Vice-style speed boat while May picks a 1939 wooden river cruiser.</p>
