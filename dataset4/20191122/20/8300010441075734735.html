      <p>SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Sheriff's investigators have arrested a 13-year-old suspect after responding to a call of a threat to shoot staff members and fellow students at √Ånimo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in South Los Angeles, authorities announced Friday.<br/><br/>According to Undersheriff Tim Murakami, deputies from the Los Angeles County sheriff's Century station initiated the investigation, which led to a search warrant and the seizure of a AR-15 rifle, a large cache of ammunition, "a list of intended victims and a drawing of the school layout."<br/><br/>At a morning news conference, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said students notified school district personnel after becoming aware of a threat that a shooting would take place at the campus on Friday.</p>

      <p>The staff notified authorities, prompting a search of the suspect's home and the discovery of the rifle, Villanueva said. About 100 rounds of ammunition were also seized, along with the target list and the rudimentary drawing.<br/><br/>The firearm was unregistered but does have a serial number, investigators said, adding that it did not appear to be a so-called ghost gun.<br/><br/>In a separate case, a sheriff's task force took a suspect into custody on suspicion of dealing and possessing illegal firearms. That individual allegedly purchased parts on the internet and "had a ghost rifle -- fully auto, silencers, body armor," said the undersheriff, who apologized for the confusion that led to the conflation of the two matters in initial news reports.</p>
