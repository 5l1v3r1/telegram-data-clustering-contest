      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/supernatural/">Supernatural</a>'s Sam Winchester, Dean Winchester and Castiel are going to get new allies in their fight against Chuck/God.</p>
      <p>The CW has released its synopsis for Season 15, Episode #15, titled "Our Father, Who Aren't in Heaven." Although the summary does not make clear just who will assist in the fight against God, there are a lot of possible candidates considering how many people and entities the brother's have encountered over the course of the series.</p>
