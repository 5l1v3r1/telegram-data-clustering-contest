      <h1>Thanos Deserves a Disney+ Series More Than Loki</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:11:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Renaldo Matadeen</a></address>
      <p>With <i>The Mandalorian</i> making waves on Disney+, fans' excitement for the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/loki-tv/"><i>Loki</i></a> television series has begun to ramp up even more. The love for Tom Hiddleston in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is strong and given the quality of the <i>Star Wars</i> spinoff, it appears the streaming service is poised to do justice to characters first given prominence by Marvel Studios such as the Falcon, Winter Soldier, Doctor Strange, Vision, and Scarlet Witch.</p>
      <p>But while it'll be interesting watching Loki hop around space and time, seeing as we've gotten so much of the trickster in the past, there's actually one MCU character that deserved this kind of attention and who should have been given his own series instead of the wicked Asgardian: Thanos (Josh Brolin).</p>

      <p>With the other characters mentioned, you can tell there's room to explore their places in the MCU in the wake of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. But a Loki series feels like overkill as the God of Mischief has gotten a lot of screen time in three <i>Thor</i> movies, Joss Whedon's <i>The Avengers</i>, and a fitting death in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. His escape in <i>Endgame</i> with a Tesseract felt so unnecessary and while there are rumors <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-plus-marvel-female-loki-sophia-di-martino/">a female Loki could be introduced</a>, it just seems like the studio's flogging this horse to death.</p>
      <p>Thanos deserves his own show way more than Loki for a couple of reasons. Firstly, death doesn't mean you can't have a spot on the streaming service, and with the revelation the Mad Titan who got snapped away by Iron Man wasn't killed, just <a href="https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-snap-thanos-death/">willed from existence</a>, hopefully, someday Disney+ and studio president Kevin Feige find a way of elaborating on Thanos. We only got the villain in full in the last two <i>Avengers</i> films, as older films had him in cameos, but you do get a sense there's a lot more story to be told.</p>

      <p>And that brings us to our second reason: Thanos felt short-sold and wasn't explored as much as a villain of his caliber should have been with such a big cast. The MCU already cut his formative years as an outcast on Titan, so seeing his family dynamic and the way he opposed scholars back home would be crucial to understanding how he formulated his plan and learned of the Infinity Stones. A catalyst or flashpoint would also make for amazing TV, giving us a character study the same way Todd Phillips did for Joaquin Phoenix's <i>Joker</i>. After all, Thanos wasn't a man of mystery like Heath Ledger's Clown Prince of Crime, he was influenced by philosophy and politics, running much deeper than someone obsessed with death.</p>

      <p>With the warlord <a href="https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-snap-thanos-alive-theory/tldr/1">Thanos being snapped away</a>, looking at how he formed the Black Order, attained the Chitauri, met with Loki and became the despot whose empire cast a dark pall over the galaxy has such potential as an origin story. Sure, we know the general gist but there are deep, intricate cuts that could inform his motives and relationships with other characters, such as the young adopted Gamora or the lackey, the Other. The point is Thanos is geek cinema's most iconic tyrant since Darth Vader and there are nuanced layers to peel back that would allow us to grasp what molded him into a universe destroyer and why he felt his mission was selfless.</p>

      <p>Yes, cosmic climate change and population control drove him, but witnessing the inspiration for all this and also factoring in he's still alive somewhere opens the potential for life after <i>Endgame. </i>Flashbacks into a mysterious and haunted past and a delve into the portrait of the MCU's biggest threat definitely add to the possibility he could still appear someday from this newly-revealed purgatory and maybe even offer redemption. Ultimately, he was a son, a student, a father and a soldier, so rather than just dissecting what he did with his vision of war in the present, Disney+ can look at the Titan before and after the snap so we could relate, empathize or even hate him more -- no matter the version of the Mad Titan we saw on the big screen.</p>
      <p><i>Loki</i>, starring Tom Hiddleston and Sophia Di Martino, is set to hit Disney+ sometime in spring 2021. <i>Rick and Morty</i> writer Michael Waldron will write the series and be billed as creator, with <i>Sex Education</i>'s Kate Herron directing all the episodes.</p>
