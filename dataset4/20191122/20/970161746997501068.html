      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/27/charlies-angels-reboot-trailer-drops-kinds-badass-10081281/">Kristen Stewart and the cast of Charlie’s Angels</a> kept things coordinated on Friday morning as they sported matching leather looks while promoting the film’s UK release.</p>
      <p>The Angels wowed during Wednesday evening’s London premiere of the action movie, but opted for more casual outfits on Friday as they visited radio station Kiss FM.</p>
      <p>With all three of the girls opting for black leather items of clothing (if there’s one thing we want from a kickass group of women, it’s coordinated outfits),<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/kristen-stewart-not-dealing-winter-weather-covers-charlies-angels-premiere-london-11191471/"> Kristen Stewart led the way in perhaps the most weather appropriate outfit for a chilly November morning.</a></p>
      <p>Wrapping up warm in a leather aviator jacket, distressed boyfriend jeans and a baseball cap, she was joined by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aladdin/">Aladdin</a> star Naomi Scott, who also opted for trousers in light wash denim jeans.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old actress paired her look with a black embossed leather tank top, layering a fur lined denim jacket and patent coat over the top which she offset with some tiny black sunglasses.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, newcomer Ella Balinska gave us serious spy vibes – but then again, isn’t the most obvious spy the one that doesn’t look like a spy at all? – in a black leather jumpsuit while sporting a pair of black sunnies.</p>

      <p>The girls are currently visiting the UK ahead of the release of Elizabeth Banks’ reboot of the action comedy classic Charlie’s Angels.</p>
      <p>We suspect that the cast are hoping the film’s international debut will help boost sales after the film grossed just $3.1 million in its US opening weekend despite receiving good reviews.</p>

      <p>Not great for a project that cost $48 million to make…</p>
      <p>However, actress Elizabeth Banks, who wrote, directed, produced and starred in the project (very impressive) seemed to be taking this bad news in her stride.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Well, if you’re going to have a flop, make sure your name is on it at least 4x,’ she wrote on Twitter, ‘I’m proud of #CharliesAngels and happy it’s in the world.’</p>
      <p>We’re glad to hear it, Elizabeth.</p>
