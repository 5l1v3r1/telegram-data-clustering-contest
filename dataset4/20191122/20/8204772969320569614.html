      <h1>Kerry student wins SciFest 2019 with ocean ‘dead zone’ combatting filter</h1>
      <h2>Timothy McGrath from Killorglin Community College was one of record 10,000 entrants</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:09:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/kevin-o-sullivan-7.1837420" target="_blank">Kevin O'Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>A student who developed a biofilter to combat “dead zones” in oceans and freshwater, has been named overall winner of SciFest 2019.</p>
      <p>Timothy McGrath, a sixth year student from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Killorglin+Community+College">Killorglin Community College</a>, Co Kerry, was one of a record 10,000 students to enter this year’s an all-<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> competition fostering interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths).</p>
      <p>Following 16 regional finals 77 students went on to exhibit 41 projects at the national final in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Marino+Institute+of+Education">Marino Institute of Education</a> in Dublin on Friday.</p>
      <p>Timothy devised a technically-viable way to use halophyte plants, which are noted for their salt tolerance to counteract eutrophication, which occurs when waters become enriched, often due to human activity, and increases the risk of toxic algal blooms. He will represent Ireland at the International Science and Engineering Fair in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=California">California</a> next May.</p>
      <h3>Sustainability to the fore</h3>
      <p>Projects on sustainability, climate change and developing bioplastics were to the fore in the contest which is supported by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Science+Foundation+Ireland">Science Foundation Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Intel">Intel</a> Ireland, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Boston+Scientific">Boston Scientific</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Specsavers">Specsavers</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Technological+Higher+Education+Association">Technological Higher Education Association</a> award was given to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ruth+Madden">Ruth Madden</a>, a fifth year student at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Largy+College">Largy College</a> in Clones, Co Monaghan, who developed a filter proven to reduce microplastics entering the environment through wastewater from washing machines.</p>
      <p>She designed and constructed a low maintenance filtration unit capable of intercepting microplastics. Some 85 per cent of microplastics in the sea arise from washing machines and clothes, she noted, “It’s human-made. It’s horrible.” Ironically, the filter is made of acrylic but it is easily cleaned and reusable.</p>
      <p>In a move to counter fast fashion, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Willemijn+Bosschaert">Willemijn Bosschaert</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eva+Connolly">Eva Connolly</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ella+Shanahan">Ella Shanahan</a>, pupils at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Loreto+Secondary+School">Loreto Secondary School</a> in Balbriggan, Co Dublin, made a biodegradable fabric by dissolving sodium alginate and polylactic acid and “electrospinning” the solution into a fibre – they won the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Berlin">Berlin</a> Long Night of Science award.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ronan+Walsh">Ronan Walsh</a> from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Durrow">Durrow</a>, who attends Coláiste Choilm in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Tullamore">Tullamore</a>, developed a fully-fledged domestic treatment system for grey water arising from showers and washing machines, which uses a variety of filters.</p>
      <p>Success came in the form of the ability to constantly water his family’s vegetable plot – unlike what happened during a drought in 2018 – compliance with water quality guidelines and the ability to monitor water quality using smart technology. He work culminated in him wining the Society for Science and the Public Award for Community Innovation.</p>
      <h3>Re-inventing the wheel</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Alice+Shaughnessy">Alice Shaughnessy</a>, who attends <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Calasanctius+College">Calasanctius College</a> in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Oranmore">Oranmore</a>, Co Galway, literally tried to re-invent the wheel by changing the standard wheel and axle system using magnets and sensors that could make devices “omni-directional” with the ability to negotiate tight spaces. Her prototype, which she believed has obvious potential in robotics and wheelchairs, won the Intel technology award.</p>
      <p>SciFest chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sheila+Porter">Sheila Porter</a> said: “The standard of entries this year has been extraordinary . . . The students of today are focussed on the future, the future of our environment and what this means for the global climate. We encourage this year’s entrants to continue to ask questions and be bold in their pursuit in using science to help them understand the world around them.”</p>
      <p>Minister for Communication, Climate Action and Environment <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Richard+Bruton">Richard Bruton</a> said that given climate disruption was the biggest challenge facing this generation of young people, “it’s fantastic to see so many young people engaging with the issue and looking at practical, creative solutions which could contribute to our response. The projects show how STEM can be applied to real world problems, often in unexpected ways.”</p>
