      <p>In just a few weeks, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a> will shake the Arrowverse like never before. Unlike some previous crossovers, not every hero is gonna make it out alive. This five-part crossover event is based upon Marv Wolfman and George Perez’s 12-issue 1985 crossover that redefined the DC Universe. Now, The CW has released the synopses from the first three episodes of <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/supergirl"><b>Supergirl</b></a> will kick off the event on Sunday, December 8. Robert Rovner and Marc Guggenheim wrote the story, while the teleplay was written by Derek Simon and Jay Faerber.</p>
      <p>
        <i>THE KICKOFF TO THE EPIC TELEVISON CROSSOVER EVENT, CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS – The Monitor (guest star LaMonica Garrett) sends Harbinger (guest star Audrey Marie Anderson) to gather the worlds’ greatest heroes – Supergirl (Melissa Benoist), The Flash (guest star Grant Gustin), Green Arrow (guest star Stephen Amell), Batwoman (guest star Ruby Rose), White Canary (guest star Caity Lotz), The Atom (guest star Brandon Routh) and Superman (guest star Tyler Hoechlin) – in preparation for the impending Crisis. With their worlds in imminent danger, the superheroes suit up for battle while J’onn (David Harewood) and Alex (Chyler Leigh) recruit Lena (Katie McGrath) to help them find a way to save the people of Earth-38.</i>

      <p>On Monday, December 9, <b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/batwoman">Batwoman</a> </b>will continue the event. Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson will write this episode, which heavily features various Supermen.</p>
      <p>
        <i>CAN THE REAL CLARK KENT PLEASE STAND UP? PART TWO OF CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS CONTINUES WITH SPECIAL GUEST STARS TOM WELLING, ERICA DURANCE AND KEVIN CONROY – The group uses Ray’s (guest star Brandon Routh) invention to track new recruits to help save the universe. The Monitor (guest star LaMonica Garrett) sends Iris (guest star Candice Patton), Clark (guest star Tyler Hoechlin) and Lois (guest star Elizabeth Tulloch) in search of a mysterious Kryptonian, while Kate (Ruby Rose) and Kara (guest star Melissa Benoist) head out to find Bruce Wayne (guest star Kevin Conroy).

      <p>Finally, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-flash"><b>The Flash</b></a> will close out 2019 with Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three on Tuesday, December 10. Eric Wallace wrote the story, with Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates on the teleplay. Additionally, this is the episode that brings Black Lightning into the Arrowverse.</p>
      <p>
        <i>BLACK LIGHTNING JOINS THE ARROWVERSE IN THE THIRD CHAPTER OF THE CROSSOVER – Pariah (Tom Cavanagh) enlists Black Lightning (guest star Cress Williams) to help stop the Anti-Monitor (guest star LaMonica Garrett) after Flash-90 (guest star John Wesley Shipp) shares what he learned from his battle in ‘Elseworlds.’ With the help of Black Lightning, Barry (Grant Gustin), Cisco (Carlos Valdes) and Killer Frost (Danielle Panabaker) come up with a plan that could save them all. Meanwhile, Iris (Candice Patton) has a heart-to-heart with Ryan Choi (guest star Osric Chau), while Oliver (guest star Stephen Amell) and Diggle (guest star David Ramsey) return to an old familiar stomping ground.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Then on Tuesday, January 14, 2020, <b>Arrow</b> and <b>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow</b> will wrap up the crossover.</p>
