      <p>More than 10,000 LED light bulbs make up the <a href="https://www.luminocityfestival.com/">LuminoCity Festival</a>. Inspired by its 29-year-old co-founder’s memories of the lantern festivals in her Zigong, China, hometown, this interactive attraction covers nearly 700,000 square feet of Randall’s Island. And nearly all of it is handmade, by 43 artisans flown in from Zigong City, who spent three months hand-dyeing and gluing the installations.</p>
      <p>“During my first holiday season in New York, I went to check out the Dyker Heights lights,” Xiaoyi Chen, the Chinese-born Pratt graduate, tells The Post. She says that while she found the south Brooklyn display “joyous,” she couldn’t help but recall the annual light festivals she’d grown up with.</p>
      <p>LuminoCity is actually three cities in one: Winter Fantasy, which features a 13-foot-tall frozen unicorn and a nearly 30-foot-high twinkling castle; Wild Adventure, with animatronic dinosaurs and lush, prehistoric-looking greenery; and the sugar-themed Sweet Dream, which boasts a doughnut tunnel Homer Simpson would love. Chinese lanterns are scattered throughout.</p>

      <p>There’s a pathway of illuminated discs that change color as you walk along it, and you can ride on a “moonbeam” swing. There’s even a section for cat lovers, with statues inspired by Instagram-famous felines.</p>
      <p>You can try your hand at lantern-making, bracelet-weaving and other traditional Chinese crafts in a huge heated tent; shop for holiday merch at the market and fuel up with dumplings and fried ice cream.</p>
      <p>Expect to spend at least an hour for the full effect. LuminoCity is handicap accessible.</p>
