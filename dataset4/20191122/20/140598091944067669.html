      <h1>Disney accused of hypocrisy for 'pumping out' plastic Frozen 2 merchandise despite eco plot line</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/helena-horton/" target="_blank">Helena Horton</a></address>
      <p>Adults taking their children to watch Frozen 2 are set to be bombarded with questions about the environment, as in the film the two heroines battle the elements in order to save humanity and nature.</p>
      <p>However, after the film hit screens today, children across the world are also bound to beg their parents for the "must-have" plastic toys associated with the franchise, with some already selling out.</p>
      <p>Plastics campaigners have accused Disney of hypocrisy as they "pump out" plastic toys at the same time as  jumping on the eco-friendly bandwagon.</p>
      <p>Frozen was a cash cow for the company, raking in $1.3 billion at the box office in 2013. However, the merchandise sales dwarfed this figure, with the licensing segment of entertainment and characters accumulating $107.2 billion.</p>
      <p>It is no wonder, then, that the number three must-have toy on the annual Toymakers' Association Christmas list is the £39.99 Frozen 2 ‘Into the Unknown’ Elsa Doll, made of plastic. This is sold-out in many stores, including John Lewis.</p>
      <p>This is just one of many plastic figurines which have been released to promote the film and are set to be under thousands of Christmas trees this year.</p>

      <p>Recycling and environment campaigners have criticised the toys from the film, arguing that they are at odds with the overall message.</p>
      <p>Julian Kirby, plastics pollution campaigner with Friends of The Earth, said:  “This film has pushed a strongly progressive narrative appealing just as much to parents as Elsa and Anna have to children.</p>
      <p>"If the franchise wants to keep inspiring young audiences it should recognise that anti-pollution messages will chime with them far more than pumping out another predictable range of plastic destined for landfill. Disney has spoken about reducing their environmental impact so cutting out frivolous plastic would be a positive step on their way to sustainability.”</p>
      <p>The Recycling Association chief executive Simon Ellin warned against purchasing non-recyclable toys at Christmas, especially as the most popular Frozen toys feature sound and light, which make them almost impossible to dispose of in an eco-friendly way.</p>
      <p>He told The Telegraph: “We don’t want to come across as Scrooge at Christmas and spoil the fun of children who will excitedly open their Frozen 2 toys on Christmas morning.</p>

      <p>“But the reality is that plastic toys are very hard to recycle. Some local authorities will take them at the household waste recycling centre, while others will not. Even then, they are often difficult to recycle because they are a mix of different plastics.</p>
      <p>“Just as we have advised packaging designers to use one easily recyclable plastic, we hope that toy designers working on Christmas 2020 will look at ways they can use a single, recyclable plastic. When the toy goes out of fashion, that way it can be easily recycled.</p>
      <p>“For those toys that contain electronics for sound and lights, these also make recycling difficult. Again, design has to ensure the toys are safe, but that the electronics can be easily removed for recycling separately.”</p>
      <p>Parents and grandparents have also voiced their concern about the plastic toys.</p>
      <p>Anne Cook, a grandmother who runs the Thames Valley Rotary Club said: "Conflicted message from Frozen 2 - the film says ‘Save the Planet’ but Disney has licensed a tsunami of plastic tat as money making merchandise".</p>
      <p>Annie Bannister, a mother and teacher, added: "It's a film basically focusing on the destruction of the environment.....yet is plastic merch central! But, yes, I have bought Frozen toys for Christmas."</p>
      <p>Disney has been contacted for comment.</p>
