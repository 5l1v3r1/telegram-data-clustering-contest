      <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.iamthecatphotographer.com/">Andrew Marttila</a> has a job that would make any animal lover swoon: he specializes in capturing the cuteness and quirks of our <a href="http://www.insider.com/cats-before-after-adoption-photos-2018-6">feline friends</a>.</p>
      <p>Insider spoke to Marttila about his latest project, “<a href="https://www.runningpress.com/titles/andrew-marttila/cats-on-catnip/9780762463671/">Cats on Catnip</a>,” which offers a humorous, uninhibited look at cats enjoying the green stuff.</p>

      <h3>“I have always loved animals. From a very young age I was exposed to nature programs on television and became entranced by the wonder and diversity of the animal kingdom,” Marttila said.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>But there was one small issue. Marttila was allergic to most pets – cats included.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Thanks to allergies, he grew up with some unorthodox pets such as lizards, turtles, hedgehogs, and even a chicken.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Although he never outgrew his allergies, he’s built up a tolerance to the cats he and his girlfriend have, including three permanent additions to the family <a href="http://www.kittenlady.org/meetthekittens">and six fosters</a>.</p>
      <p>To manage his symptoms, he takes allergy pills and carries around an inhaler.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Marttila says he became interested in animal photography the first time he took pictures of his cat with a digital camera.</h3>

      <p>“An incredibly unique quality of animals is that they are without pretension and are unapologetically themselves, always. The moment I was able to capture that essence through a lens was the moment I became hooked,” he said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>While pursuing a degree in neuroscience, he began honing his camera skills for fun.</h3>

      <p>At first, it was just a hobby.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>After graduating from college, Marttila took a year to see if he could make it as a photographer.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>He knew it would be tough.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>He quickly amassed a following through social media, and through books like “Shop Cats of New York.”</h3>

      <p>He was inspired by a former roommate’s cat who would go wild for the green stuff.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Friends and strangers online got a kick out of the early catnip photos he took.</h3>

      <p>“Out of all the photos I used to take, the catnip photos always evoked the most responses out of people in person and on the internet,” he said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>So he decided to photograph dozens of cats and their hilarious reactions to catnip.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>He initially envisioned the project as a photo gallery rather than a book.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>In order to capture the essence of his feline subjects, Marttila takes what he calls a “laissez-faire” approach.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>“If you’ve spent even a few minutes with a cat, you’ll soon realize they have their own agenda, and getting them to do your bidding is an exercise in futility,” he explained.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Cats’ unpredictability can be frustrating.</h3>
      <figure>

      <hr/>
      <h3>Marttila takes time to ensure that the cats are comfortable sharing their space with him.</h3>

      <p>Then he lets them “exhibit their own natural behaviors.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>If catnip is present, the results are bound to be amusing.</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>“If a cat is unsettled, they’re never going to show you who they really are,” Marttila said.</h3>
