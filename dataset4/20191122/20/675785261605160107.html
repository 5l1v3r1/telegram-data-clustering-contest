      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Paratrooper Danny Fitzsimons was sentenced to 20 years in prison after shooting security workers in Baghdad following a drunken row - but he is now heading back to the UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Hughes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-hughes/</a></address>
      <p>A former British soldier jailed in Iraq <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/danny-fitzsimons-iraq-security-guard-5134526">for 20 years after murdering two colleagues</a> has been secretly extradited back to the UK to serve the rest of his sentence.</p>
      <p>Ex-Paratrooper Danny Fitzsimons spent just eight years in a brutal Baghdad prison after shooting dead fellow security workers in a drunken row in the Iraqi capital.</p>
      <p>The war veteran killed fellow Brit and ex-Royal Marine Paul McGuigan, 37 and Australian Darren Hoare, 37, just hours after arriving at the G4S security base in August 2009.</p>
      <p>After being arrested and thrown in a holding cell he told horrified colleagues he was acting in self-defence and later claimed he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
      <p>He was jailed in 2011 following the 2009 killing and became the first westerner convicted in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and since the law changed making foreigners no longer immune to prosecution.</p>

      <p>All three men had served time in the forces and left regular service to cash in on the booming private security industry across the Middle East, especially Iraq.</p>
      <p>They were working for the security company ArmorGroup, then based in the Iraqi capital’s relatively safe Green Zone at the time of the shooting and part of the company G4S.</p>
      <p>It is believed Fitzsimons, now a 41 year-old, was an exceptional marksman who served with 2 Para.</p>
      <p>He shot both victims with his Glock 9mm pistol, with McGuigan shot twice in the chest and once at point blank range in the mouth.</p>
      <p>Mr McGuigan had a son, then ten years-old from a previous relationship and a fiancee Nichola Prestage, then 37, who was pregnant with his daughter when he died.</p>
      <p>She said of Fitzsimons after the inquest into her partner’s death: “He’s nothing but a psychopath -and in his own words was bloodthirsty to kill again.”</p>

      <p>The Coroner rejected Fitzsimons’ post traumatic stress defence -which he made about his time in Kosovo with British forces.</p>
      <p>An Iraqi judge jailed Fitzsimons for 20 years and he was expected, with good behaviour, to be released after 15 years- but was sent to the UK early and is thought to be in Wandsworth Prison.</p>
      <p>After he was sentenced by an Iraqi court his local lawyer said he was lucky he had been saved from the gallows.</p>
      <p>In Iraq it is customary to be released after serving three quarters of a sentence and it is believed Fitzsimons had been held in a holding cell inside the Green Zone before his court appearance.</p>
      <p>With time served awaiting trial it means he has already served a decade in Iraq. In the UK an inquest into the deaths of the two ex-soldiers learned G4S hired him without doing a proper background check on him.</p>
      <p>The violent steroid user had jumped bail, having been dismissed from the Army and was on the run for a string of offences back home.</p>
      <p>It is thought he shot his two colleagues dead less than 12 hours after arriving in Iraq.</p>
      <p>It is believed once inside the Iraqi prison Fitzsimons was forced to fight for his life almost on a daily basis against fellow prisoners who attacked him for being an ex-British soldier.</p>
      <p>In prison he was amongst some of Iraq’s most dangerous criminals as the prison is teeming with al-Qaeda and Islamic State loyalists who detest westerners- especially western military personnel.</p>
      <p>Fitzsimons, originally from Rochdale, also found his identity difficult to hide as he is thought to have English football-related tattoos.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mirror also believes he has learned to speak fluent Arabic during his time behind bars but it is not known if he has become religious.</p>
      <p>Sources have also told the Daily Mirror he may be released from behind bars in 2024.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Justice told the Daily Mirror: “We can confirm Danny Fitzsimons was</p>
      <p>released to the UK earlier this year to serve the rest of his term under the prisoner release system.”</p>
