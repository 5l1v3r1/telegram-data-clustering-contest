      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>OnePlus is emailing customers about a database breach.</li>
        <li>Company says passwords and payment info are safe, but emails, contact numbers and shipping addresses were leaked.</li>
        <li>It's not clear when the breach happened or how many people were affected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OnePlus is emailing customers with a boilerplate message about "order information [that] was accessed by an unauthorized party." The company says that while passwords, payment information and account information is safe, "name, contact number, email and shipping addresses may have been exposed."</p>

      <p>In the email, which does not include the number of people affected nor how far back into OnePlus's customer history the breach goes, the company says that "We took immediate steps to stop the intruder and reinforce security. Right now, we are working with the relevant authorities to further investigate this incident and protect your data." Two people at Android Central received the email, too, with one not using the OnePlus store since buying the OnePlus 6 release back in mid-2018.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time OnePlus has reported a data breach. Back in January 2018, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-confirms-40000-users-affected-credit-card-breach">the company said that 40,000 users of its online store were affected</a> by a malicious script added to its payment code that scraped the credit and debit card data of people buying products on its store.</p>
      <p>A statement from OnePlus mirrored the wording in the email sent to customers, noting:</p>
      <blockquote>OnePlus has notified impacted users that we have discovered that some of their order information was accessed by an unauthorized party. We can confirm that all payment information, passwords and accounts are safe, but certain users' name, contact number, email and shipping address may have been exposed.<br/>We took immediate steps to stop the intruder and reinforce security. Before making this public, we informed our impacted users by email. Right now, we are working with the relevant authorities to further investigate this incident.<br/>We are deeply sorry about this, and are committed to doing everything in our power to prevent further such incidents.
