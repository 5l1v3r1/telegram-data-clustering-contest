      <h1>Inter Milan Manager Antonio Conte Tells His Players To Have Sex With ‘Least Effort Possible’ During Season</h1>

      <p>Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte wants to make sure his players are always refreshed and ready for every game, so if that means diving into their personal sex lives, then so be it.</p>
      <p>Antonio Conte believes his players should have sex, but advises them to so with minimal effort throughout the season.</p>
      <blockquote>“I was a player as well, during the season, <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Antonio-conte-je-suis-un-esprit-libre-pas-un-leche-cul/1082294">sex should not last long</a>.”<br/><br/>“During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort.”<br/><br/>“[My players] better use positions where they are under their partners…And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action.”</blockquote>

      <p>So basically, Conte wants his players to get off during sex, but not to care about their partner’s needs in that scenario. I’m pretty sure every wife of every player on the team just loved to hear this.</p>
