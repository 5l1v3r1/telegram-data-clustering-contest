      <p>An Arizona man is facing multiple drug, firearm and money laundering charges after federal authorities raided his multi-million-dollar home northwest of Tucson Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old man is facing more than a dozen charges including narcotic sales, drug possession, drug manufacturing, money laundering and weapons violations in connection with the raid.</p>
      <p>KGUN 9 was there when federal authorities executed a search warrant at the home northwest of Tucson. Agents with Homeland Security Investigations hauled away a slew of vehicles from the scene, including pickup trucks, SUVs, a motorboat, a sports car and a trailer with a business decal.</p>
      <p>The business advertised on the trailer is listed at an address in Oro Valley, which it shares with a restaurant.</p>
      <p>Real estate listings advertise a $2.4 million price tag for the home, and property records show it was sold for $1.6 million in the past few years.</p>
