      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Aaron Nesmith scored 20 points and Clevon Brown added a career-high 19 in Vanderbilt’s 97-60 win over South Carolina State on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Nesmith entered the game leading the nation in 3-pointers (5.25 per game) and ranked third in scoring (26.5).</p>
      <p>The Commodores, playing their second game in three days, showed no fatigue as they seized a 19-point halftime lead.</p>
      <p>Maxwell Evans scored 15 points, Saben Lee had 12 and Dylan Disu added 10 for the Commodores (4-1).</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt, the Southeastern Conference leader in field goal percentage, shot 60% from the floor.</p>
      <p>South Carolina State (2-3), which shot 64.9 % from the floor in its previous game, cooled off at 40% against the Commodores.</p>

      <p>Vanderbilt shot 61 percent from the floor in the first half to take a commanding 47-26 lead after 20 minutes. It was the Commodores’ best shooting first half of the season.</p>
      <p>The Commodores shot 68 percent in the second half of their previous game, a 90-72 win over Austin Peay.</p>
      <p>Brown had five dunks in the first 20 minutes as the guard-heavy Commodores pounded the ball inside.</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt outscored South Carolina State 46-26 in the paint.</p>
      <p>The Commodores wore 1968 throwback uniforms. Perry Wallace, the first black player in the SEC, played his first season for the Commodores in 1967-68.</p>
