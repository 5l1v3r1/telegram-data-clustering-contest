      <p>“Michael J. Pollard was one of a kind. Made every film he was in better. You sat up and took notice,” Larry Karaszewski, “<a href="https://variety.com/t/dolemite-is-my-name/">Dolemite Is My Name</a>” producer, tweeted. “I met him once on the street in Beverly Hills and tried to pay him a compliment. He growled at me. I mean — literally growled at me. It was a perfect moment.”</p>
