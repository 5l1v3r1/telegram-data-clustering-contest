      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joel-ward/"><b>Joel Ward</b></a> was forced off with a groin problem during the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea before the international break, but has recovered and is available to face the Reds.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/wilfried-zaha/"><b>Wilfried Zaha</b></a> is also in contention despite previously reporting a foot injury and will hope to open his goal account for the season this weekend.</p>
      <p>Liverpool duo <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohamed-salah/"><b>Mohamed Salah</b></a> and Andy Robertson both face late checks on ankle injuries that saw them sit out their respective national team games this week.</p>
      <p>The pair have trained this week, although not full-time with the rest of the squad, and manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> will leave it until the last minute before ruling out either.</p>
      <p>Forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/xherdan-shaqiri/"><b>Xherdan Shaqiri</b></a> is fit again after a long absence with a calf injury while centre-back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joel-matip/"><b>Joel Matip</b></a>'s knee problem will probably see him sit out again.</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace provisional squad: Guaita, Hennessey, Ward, Van Aanholt, Tomkins, Sakho, Schlupp, Cahill, Dann, Kelly, Milivojevic, Kouyate, McArthur, Meyer, McCarthy, Camarasa, Ayew, Zaha, Benteke, Townsend, Wickham.</p>
      <p>Liverpool provisional squad: Alisson, Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Gomez, Robertson, Milner, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Keita, Lallana, Salah, Origi, Brewster, Firmino, Mane.</p>
