      <h1>Wisconsin vs. Purdue: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:11:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>After a torrid start to the year, the No. 12 Wisconsin Badgers have come back to the pack a bit in recent weeks. They remain a contender to win the Big Ten West, but will need to get by the 4-6 Purdue Boilermakers to do so.</p>
      <p>Jeff Brohm’s Purdue has been one of the better stories in college football over the last few years. This season has been a step back, in large part due to a litany of injuries, including those to superstar receiver <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/purdue/video-rondale-moore-suffers-nasty-leg-injury-vs-minnesota">Rondale Moore</a> and starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar.</p>
      <p>Purdue has been resilient though, and has given teams some tough games of late. The Boilermakers have won two straight against Nebraska and Northwestern, and gave really tough games to Iowa and Minnesota earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin is a big favorite at Camp Randall Stadium, but the Badgers can’t look past Purdue ahead of next weekend’s potential Big Ten West title showdown against Minnesota. If the two teams win this weekend, the winner of that Week 14 game will face the Ohio State-Penn State winner in Indianapolis, in all likelihood.</p>

      <p>Wisconsin picked up a road win in a thriller last season, outlasting Purdue to win 47-44 in triple overtime. Jonathan Taylor had 33 carries for 321 yards and three touchdowns, in one of the most impressive games of his career.</p>
      <p>Moore, who was one of the most exciting players in college football last season, had nine catches for 114 yards and two scores, and also ran for 27 yards for Brohm’s team.</p>
      <p>The Badgers are winners of 13 straight over Purdue, and haven’t lost in this series since 2003. That Joe Tiller-led Boilermakers squad featured Kyle Orton at quarterback, and finished 9-4 with a close loss to Georgia in the Capital One Bowl.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin owns the all-time series 49-29-8.</p>
