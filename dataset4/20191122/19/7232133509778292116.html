      <h1>Bitcoin Price Due For a Bounce According to ‘Nokia Curse’</h1>

      <p>It’s not uncommon for technical crypto analysts to compare <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin-price">Bitcoin price</a> charts with that of other assets hoping to draw some comparisons that an actionable strategy can be derived from.</p>
      <p>The leading crypto asset by market cap has been closely following the price action of early Nokia stocks, and if <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> continues to follow the pattern closely, a bounce is due in the near term.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price Ready to Bounce If Nokia Curse Fractal Is Followed</h3>
      <p>In recent weeks, analysts trying to find meaningful comparisons to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin-price">Bitcoin price</a> charts have looked to everything from post-dot com bubble Amazon, to avocados, and now, the original iconic cell phone Nokia.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The stock price of early mainstream cell phone manufacturer Nokia Corporation went parabolic, and formed a blow-off top peak much like Bitcoin did during the 2017 hype bubble, where the crypto asset had a highly-publicized meteoric rise that took its price to $20,000 and made the asset a household name, just like Nokia.</p>
      <p>But after that peak, Nokia – like Bitcoin – plummeted and set a low far deeper than the parabolic top, before rising once again. After that bottom, the asset formed an echo-bubble much like Bitcoin has formed during 2019 – essentially a miniature fractal of the former bubble with price action that mimics the original.</p>
      <p>Just like the larger, parabolic top, Nokia’s stock price tanked once again, before setting a new, lower bottom later down the line.</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin-price">Bitcoin price</a> does continue to follow Nokia’s stock price so perfectly, it could suggest a bounce is very near. Upon zooming in on Nokia’s price chart, after setting a new lower low, the asset briefly rises once again, marking a bearish retest of former support turned resistance before turning back down and falling much deeper to its eventual bottom.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Should the same price action play out in Bitcoin price charts, the crypto asset should bounce here and make a run once again for above $8,000, before failing to break back above into bullish territory and suffers a deep collapse soon after.</p>
      <h3>Cell Phone Memes, and Crypto Chart Comparisons</h3>
      <p>At one point, Nokia was a new, emerging technology, much like Bitcoin, but once newer, and better technology emerged, the stock price never again returned to such highs, and the cell phone itself has become a meme known for its dangerous drops – also much like Bitcoin.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Given the size and weight of Nokia phones, the internet is<a href="https://ifunny.co/tags/3310/1431230077"> flooded with memes</a> showing what happens when a Nokia device is dropped from a distance, leaving a crater in its wake. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin-price">Bitcoin price</a> drops are just as dramatic, causing billions to disappear from its market cap in a matter of minutes at times.</p>
      <p>However, the comparison between the two assets stops there, as the price chart fractal is likely nothing more than a coincidence, much like avocados, Amazon, and others that have been compared to Bitcoin in the past.</p>
