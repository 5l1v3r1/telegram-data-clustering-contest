      <h2>Israeli PM fights for survival against indictments, opposition and some in own party</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:21:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">Mehul Srivastava</a></address>
      <p>A defiant Benjamin Netanyahu went on the attack after prosecutors this week said he would be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1b4cd08-0c78-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">charged over the corruption allegations </a>that have dogged the Israeli leader for two years.</p>
      <p>The four-time prime minister, now fighting for his political survival, called out “outside interests” for plotting against him and demanded that the “investigators be investigated”. Avichai Mandelblit, the attorney general, had run a “tainted investigation” tailor-made to find him guilty.</p>
      <p>“You have to be blind not to see that something bad is happening to police investigators and the prosecution,” he said in a 17-minute speech that swung between bluster and sincerity, fury and agony. “We’re seeing an attempted coup by the police with false accusations …It’s meant to topple a rightwing prime minister [who] wants to see a strong country, not a weak, shrunken, bowed country.”</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has dominated the nation’s politics since the 1990s and Israel’s political Houdini made it clear he has no intention of going anywhere.</p>
      <p>It could be months before he is formally charged and perhaps the middle of next year before a trial can begin. In the meantime, as long as he remains prime minister, he has the option of seeking immunity from a parliamentary panel.</p>
      <p>That means the real threat to his leadership may not come from a prolonged criminal case but from the possibility that disillusioned members of his Likud party could decide to band together with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd38f056-f495-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6">his main challenger, Benny Gantz</a>, to bring an end to his premiership. “Could it happen? Yes, of course — it’s what all of us are talking about,” said one veteran member of the Likud Central Committee. “Will it happen? That’s what Bibi needs to worry about.”</p>
      <blockquote>Bibi has a lot of friends, but he also has a lot of enemies<cite>Senior Likud member</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The clock is already ticking. Neither Mr Netanyahu nor Mr Gantz has been able to form a government in the wake of two deadlocked polls this year, and parliament now has less than three weeks to conjure up a majority for a single leader, or face its third set of polls in 11 months.</p>
      <p>If elections are called, Mr Netanyahu would remain interim prime minister until the vote — likely to be in March — and could use the prestige, power and reach of the office to lead his defence to the charges. There is no requirement in Israeli law for him to step down as prime minister while under indictment.</p>
      <p>But if Likud members defect, enabling Mr Gantz’s Blue and White alliance to form a so-called unity government within the next 20 days, it would leave Mr Netanyahu at his most exposed — a dethroned prime minister facing criminal prosecution.</p>
      <p>“This is going to be day by day. Every day he has to defend himself,” said a second Likud central committee member, who said he would vote against Mr Netanyahu if there was a party primary right now. “Bibi has a lot of friends, but he also has a lot of enemies.”</p>
      <p>The second committee member said at least two Likud members of parliament had already called for fresh primaries, and that other potential leaders were waiting in the wings.</p>

      <p>But for party members to abandon Mr Netanyahu would be to go against historical precedent. Likud, which has risen from the margins to dominate Israeli politics, has a history of loyalty to its leaders; there have only been four since the 1970s. And for nearly a decade, Mr Netanyahu has made it as difficult as possible for potential successors to build support. Even the most likely contender, Gideon Sa’ar, a former minister, remains a relative unknown to the nation.</p>
      <p>In a sign of Mr Netanyahu’s control, several leaders from Likud and its constellation of allies, have already voiced their public support for the man who has kept the Israeli right in government for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Israel Katz, foreign minister, said: “Only the public and its representatives in the Knesset will decide democratically who will lead Israel.”</p>
      <p>The opposition is preparing a court action to force Mr Netanyahu to step down, a process that legal analysts say is likely to end up in front of the Supreme Court within weeks.</p>
      <p>For now, Mr Netanyahu’s focus is on blocking Mr Gantz’s efforts to form a majority and on challenging the legitimacy of the legal process that led to his indictment. For two years the prime minister has compared the probe to a witch-hunt enabled by a leftwing media. He has consistently attacked the investigators and witnesses involved but held back from challenging the attorney general.</p>
      <p>That changed with Thursday’s speech, which experts compared to a declaration of all-out war on the police and judiciary.</p>
      <p>“I am really afraid,” said Oren Gazal-Ayal, a law professor at the University of Haifa. “Until now, he refrained from attacking the attorney general directly — he went for the state’s attorney, the district attorney and the police. But now, it is different.”</p>
