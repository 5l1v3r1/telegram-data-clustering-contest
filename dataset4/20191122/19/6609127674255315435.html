      <p>Glasgow Sheriff Court heard Sloan called supervisor Campbell for advice after Andrew, 55, fell at 5.30pm in his home in the city’s Carntyne.</p>
      <p>But he was told to leave the vulnerable man — who has the mental capacity of a six-year-old — where he was.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Graham MacDonald said: “Mr McKinnell wanted to get out and didn’t receive assistance.”</p>
      <p>Sloan then went to sleep at midnight, leaving Andrew stuck overnight.</p>
      <p>He was only rescued when Campbell, of Glasgow’s Bridgeton, turned up at 10am the next day and alerted a fellow supervisor.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to hospital at 2.30pm where he was found to have suffered bruising on his back.</p>
      <p>Sloan, of Dennistoun, Glasgow, and Campbell, admitted wilful neglect in November last year.</p>
      <p>Sloan was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work while Campbell received 240 hours.</p>
      <p>The pair had been working for non-profit firm Inclusion Glasgow.</p>
