        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a>’s husband Derek Draper and their two children Darcey and William appeared on Good Morning Britain to talk about her time on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> so far.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derek, 52, sat next to the young ‘uns that Kate was previously seen getting emotional over in the jungle when she spoke about how she was missing them.</p>
      <p>Derek quipped: ‘I never get a mention by the way. “Oh I miss the kids”, what about me?’</p>
      <p>With Kate’s time in the jungle having only just started, let’s take a closer look at the family she’s been missing so much.</p>
      <h3>How old are Kate Garraway’s children?</h3>
      <p>Kate Garraway daughter’s Darcey is 13 and her son William is 10.</p>
      <p>On this show, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebritys-stanley-johnson-makes-dig-women-crying-jungle-11201886/">Kate was seen getting emotional</a> when she spoke about how much she missed her children, saying she could no longer ‘remember what their heads smelled like’.</p>

      <p>When the family appeared on Good Morning Britain, Derek, a former political lobbyist, gushed about his wife, saying: ‘Take it from someone who knows – she never looks better than first thing in the morning.</p>
      <p>‘When we go on romantic breaks I beg her not to put make-up on. She’s naturally beautiful and adorable and awesome, and she’s smashing it in the jungle.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Darcey, Bill and me are so proud.’</p>

      <p>Darcey meanwhile said right off the bat that she was embarrassed when her mum said she feared creepy crawlies were going to crawl up her ‘noo-noo’ during a challenge.</p>
      <p>She had some kind words to say too, as she later said: ‘She’s so genuine and she will keep trying and she won’t put herself first, she’s like so selfless she’ll just do everything for everyone else before she thinks of herself.’</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, it came out that Kate’s children are the reason <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/kate-garraways-kids-are-the-reason-shes-on-im-a-celebrity-11179012/">why she decided to go on I’m A Celebrity,</a> with Kate telling Hello before she trekked into the jungle: ‘Darcey really got into the last few series.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘[She] kept saying “You should so do this mum.”’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘[She said] things like ‘You should eat that slug from the garden, or jump off of that wall, to practice”.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been a war of attrition.’</p>
