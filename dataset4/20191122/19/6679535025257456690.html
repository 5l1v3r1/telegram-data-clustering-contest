      <p>Six-year-old C. Sarah has a knack for solving puzzles. On Friday, she attempted to solve five 2x2 Rubik’s cubes blindfolded. Twisting and turning cube after cube, the class I student completed her attempt in three minutes while simultaneously reciting lines from a Tamil poem penned by lyricist Vairamuthu.</p>
      <p>Sarah, a student of Velammal Vidyalaya, Mel Ayanambakkam, solves puzzles with ease. Her parents Charles Daniel Raj and Julie were quick to spot her talent. “We noticed that her analytical skills were strong. She could solve different kinds of puzzles including those involving words. She had good memory skills and could recite poems in English and Tamil. In the last four months, with support from the school, she undertook training in solving Rubik’s cubes,” Mr. Raj said.</p>
      <p>“I like to solve different puzzles. I also like to dance,” Sarah said, when asked about her interests.</p>
      <p>With no second thoughts on which was her favourite subject, Sarah said she loves mathematics as she finds it easy.</p>
