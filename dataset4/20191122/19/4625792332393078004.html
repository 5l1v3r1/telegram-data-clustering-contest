      <h1>Ana Navarro: A woman can win the presidency in 2020 because one 'has already been elected'</h1>

      <p><i>The View </i>co-host Ana Navarro claimed that American voters elected Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election during a discussion about whether a female candidate could win in 2020.</p>
      <p>"I frankly think â€” this question, it gets asked over and over again," the Republican strategist, who is an outspoken critic of her party, said Friday. "Can a black person be elected? Well, we elected one already, twice. Can a woman get elected? One won 3 million more votes already. A woman has already been elected."</p>
      <p>"She didn't win the electoral college, but she was elected," Navarro added.</p>
      <p>Co-host Abby Huntsman agreed with Navarro that a woman could win, pointing out that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the most powerful people in Washington, D.C., and also a woman. Joy Behar chimed in to add that her ideal candidate to beat President Trump is Oprah Winfrey, a black woman.</p>
      <p>"Maybe in this country, what we really want is a figurehead," she said.</p>
      <p>Trump defeated Clinton in the 2016 election with an Electoral College victory of 304-227. Clinton, however, won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes.</p>
      <p>Navarro, 47, worked for Republican Gov. Jeb Bush in 1998 and the late John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. She has also worked with Democrats, such as Sen. Bob Menendez, who went to trial for corruption charges. The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/two-faces-of-the-never-trump-movement-married-in-miami">Nicaragua-born campaign consultant</a> has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/opinions/joe-biden-is-normal----and-that-sounds-really-good-to-me-navarro/index.html">praised</a> presidential contender Joe Biden, saying when the former vice president entered the 2020 race, "He inspires a feeling of trust and confidence."</p>
      <p>"After the chaos and turmoil of the last three years under Trump, 'normal' sounds really good to me," she added.</p>
      <p>In July, Navarro <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ana-navarro-suggests-deporting-ted-cruz-marco-rubio-and-melania-trump">suggested that the United States deport</a> Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio along with first lady Melania Trump.</p>
