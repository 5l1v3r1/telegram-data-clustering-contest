      <h1>NFL Insider Updates Status Of Bengals Star WR A.J. Green</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:02:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>For those waiting for A.J. Green to make his debut this season, you’ll have to wait a little longer. Once again, the star wideout on the Cincinnati Bengals will have to sit out due to his ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Green suffered the injury during training camp. The Bengals expected him to miss a significant period of time, but they were hopeful he would return after the bye week.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Green, he <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cincinnati-bengals/bengals-wr-a-j-green-is-now-out-indefinitely">re-aggravated his injury</a> while practicing a few weeks ago, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28029216/bengals-aj-green-setback-indefinitely">remains out indefinitely</a>. With another divisional matchup set for this weekend, Cincinnati will have to play without its top offensive weapon.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN insider Adam Schefter, the Bengals have ruled out Green for this Sunday against the Steelers.</p>

      <p>At this point it’s fair to wonder if Green will actually suit up at all this season.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, the Bengals should have John Ross III back on the field fairly soon.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati has struggled mightily on offense this season. Head coach Zac Taylor replaced Andy Dalton with Ryan Finley at quarterback in an effort to revitalize the team, but it didn’t really do much.</p>
      <p>The Bengals will try to earn their first win of the season on Sunday when they face the Steelers.</p>
