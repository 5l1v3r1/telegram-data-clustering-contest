      <p>This year, the EcoVision inter-school video-making contest aims to tap the creativity of university students in raising public understanding of environmental conservation through short documentaries. With the theme ‘Upcycling Heroes’, entries must feature a Philippine-based organization or individual who champions or performs upcycling as a tool for environmental sustainability. Upcycling, also known as creative reuse, is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials or unwanted products into new materials of better quality and environmental value. Epson seeks to promote the practice of upcycling as a way of strengthening anew its commitment to the environment, which is manifested not just through its reliable and energy-efficient products but also its active participation in encouraging the public to become more aware of pressing ecological issues. “It is our honor to once again partner with DENR-EMB for the second year of the EcoVision Short Film Competition. With the help of the upcycling heroes who will be featured in the students’ entries, we want to inspire the public into action and let them know that there are different ways to become more active in advocating for the conservation of the environment,” said Donna Ferro, brand and communications head of Epson Philippines. The EcoVision short film competition is open to all students at any year level and degree or course from colleges and universities in NCR, Region III, and Region IV-A during the period of the competition.

Each documentary entry must have a minimum running time of 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 minutes and should feature a Philippine-based organization, group, or individual who champions upcycling for a more sustainable Philippines. Ten documentaries will be chosen as the finalists of the competition and will serve as informative materials for the Environmental Education and Information Division (EEID) of DENR-EMB. EEID’s mission is to advance environmental education in the Philippines and disseminate environmental information to the DENR-EMB regional offices and the general public.The final winners will be determined based on their material’s strong adherence to the theme, overall excellence in storytelling, cinematic attributes and technical execution and will win cash prizes from P20,000 up to P80,000 plus Epson products for the winners’ respective schools.
