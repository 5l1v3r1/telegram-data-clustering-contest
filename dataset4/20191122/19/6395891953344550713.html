      <p><b>ABBEVILLE, S.C.Â (AP)</b> - Joe Biden has made his South Carolina presidential bid official.</p>
      <p>The former vice president filed his paperwork as a candidate in next year's Democratic primary during a stop Friday at a soul food restaurant in Abbeville.</p>
      <p>Surrounded by a crush of media and lunch time patrons at Food for the Soul, a tiny restaurant boasting a menu of fried chicken, pork chops and burgers, Biden signed his candidacy papers at a booth with state Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson.</p>
      <p>"You're officially on the ballot!" Robertson told Biden, above a din of applause from supporters.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to need your help!" Biden said to the crowd.</p>
      <p>Polls have generally shown Biden leading his rivals in South Carolina, where he maintains high popularity among the heavily black Democratic electorate. On Thursday night, he held a town hall event in Greenwood with a crowd of about 825, according to his campaign.</p>
      <p>Asked by reporters about the strength of his support in the early-voting state, Biden said, "I do feel pretty confident."</p>
      <p>Biden joins Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, on the ballot for South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary, the first in a southern state.</p>
      <p>Several candidates including Kamala Harris, author Marianne Williamson and former tech executive Andrew Yang are campaigning in the state this weekend, and officials say some could be filing their paperwork.</p>
      <p>South Carolina's filing deadline is Dec. 4.</p>
