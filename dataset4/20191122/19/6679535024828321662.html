      <p>A group of unidentified persons impersonating as notorious 'chaddi gang', broke into two houses again in Kuntloor village of Hayathnagar on the outskirts of the city late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>They decamped with about 20 Tula of gold jewellery and around ₹ 70,000 in cash. This is for the second time in the last month that alleged chaddi gang committed the offence in Kuntloor village.</p>
      <p>On October 24, the gang broke into a house and fled with 10 Tula of gold jewellery and around ₹ 45,000 and the police have not yet arrested them. Hayathnagar inspector K Satish said that around 1 a.m. the gang members gained entry inside the houses and threatened the inmates, before decamping with the booty.</p>
      <p>“They were in a group of five to six holding sticks,” he said. Soon after getting information, police teams rushed to the spot, collected clues, fingerprints and launched a manhunt for the gang. The victims told police that the gang members were speaking Telugu, while usually, the chaddi gangs are from North India. “When they left our house, I picked up an axe and tried to chase them, but a team of police officials, who were standing a few metres away from our house, were watching them (gang members) disappear in the dark,” a woman victim said, adding that police were mute spectators when the gang was on the run.</p>
