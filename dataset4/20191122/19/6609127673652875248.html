        <b>LOVE Island hunk Anton Danyluk is glad mum Sherie Ann will help him spread some festive cheer at the Scottish Sun Sunta store — saying: “She’s all I want for Christmas.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old admits his life has been turned upside down since becoming a viewers’ favourite on the hit ITV show.</p>

      <p>But it’s meant that the jet-setter hardly gets to spend time at home.<br/>So he can’t wait to team up with his cult hero mum, 55, from Blackride, West Lothian, at our shop — even though she always brings him back to reality with a crash, bang and wallop.</p>
      <p>The buff gym owner said: “You know it will be big coming out of Love Island but have no idea the true extent of it.</p>
      <p>“It’s life-changing and I’m so glad people liked me because I could have been myself on the show and they disliked me instead.</p>

      <p>“I’m happy to be home a bit more now because my mum had to get used to not being able to communicate much with me for a while.</p>
      <p>“We are both trying to adapt to this new life. It seems like forever but it’s easy to forget it’s only been four months since I left the villa.</p>
      <p>“When I came home I had been that used to staying in hotels that I hadn’t made my bed right away and she said ‘Don’t think you’re a celebrity now.’</p>
      <p>"She treats me exactly the same and that’s how it should be.</p>
      <p>"People liked me because I was humble and my mum would never let fame get a hold of me.”</p>
      <p>Since leaving the reality show, Aidrie gym owner Anton has been on a massive PA tour as well as visiting schools to talk about fitness as part of his role as World Merit Ambassador with the United Nations.</p>

      <p>He admits it’s been crazy to see the reaction from fans when they meet him in the flesh.<br/>Anton said: “People ask you to hold their babies. There’s all these different scenarios every day now that are so surreal. Some people cry and then I always try to make them laugh. I tell them</p>
      <p>they’re doing what I did when I met Craig David on the show.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice, touching moments because I’m the same guy that walked in the villa when nobody knew me.”</p>
      <p>And Anton — who recently split with his Love Island beau Belle Hassan, 21 — reveals his busy schedule means he has no time for romance. But that doesn’t stop him being flooded by offers from</p>
      <p>women trying to pull him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve always been work-orientated and I was so busy when I came out the villa that it was difficult to see anyone.</p>
      <p>“Relationships are hard to work out so for now I’m focused on the business side of things.</p>
      <p>“If it happens then great, you can’t put a time on it. But I’m single and happy and life is good, I can’t complain.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t show on Love Island but before that I always did OK with girls. And now it’s on a different level with the messages you get.</p>
      <p>“Then it becomes about who wants to be with you for the right reasons.”</p>
      <p>As he ponders what to do next, Anton hopes to back on telly. He’d even be up for doing I’m A Celebrity if the call came next year.</p>
      <p>Anton said: “A lot of people said I made Love Island this year because I was so funny. I didn’t expect that.</p>
      <p>“I would like to get back on TV so things like Strictly, Dancing On Ice, I’m A Celeb, I’d be up for anything. My main thing is always about helping as many young people as I can so if that means</p>
      <p>kids’ TV then I’d do that as well.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote>People liked me because I was humble and my mum would never let fame get a hold of me.</blockquote>
      <p>“Presenting would be fun as well. Once you’re on TV it’s hard to give it up. I loved it and want to do it again as soon as I can.”</p>
      <p>Before that, Anton also has a new fitness venture being released in the New Year.</p>
      <p>He added: “Unfortunately I can’t say too much. But fitness has been my real passion for years and is what I want to do.</p>
      <p>“Now I’m looking forward to using my platform to make this new business as big as possible.”</p>
      <p>Now the countdown is on until Anton and Sherie Ann open our pop-up charity store on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Our Sunta store is going to be more amazing than ever after Amazon dropped off an incredible £5,000 worth of goodies.</p>
      <p>All proceeds will go towards raising vital funds for our chosen charities MND Scotland and Alzheimer’s Scotland.</p>
      <p>And Anton can’t think of anything better. He said: “I’ve been fortunate that none of my immediate family has either of these two illnesses.</p>
      <p>“But I know people who have and it must be dreadful. With so much going on in our lives, sometimes we forget how lucky we are just to be healthy.</p>
      <p>“There are no cures for MND or Alzheimer’s, so we need to keep raising cash until we find them.”</p>
