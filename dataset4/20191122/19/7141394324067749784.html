      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:04:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin’s parabolic move to the downside continues.</p>
      <p>The leading cryptocurrency briefly dropped below $7,000 before bouncing to its current price of $7,194.</p>
      <p>The drop once again pulled the overall crypto market into the deep red, with Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin dropping 3% or more in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Here’s the bird’s-eye view from <a href="https://coin360.com/">COIN360</a> at time of publishing.</p>

      <p>Amid the crypto market free fall, the needle on the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index from <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">Alternative.me</a> has shifted into “extreme fear.”</p>
      <p>The gauge analyzes market volatility, surveys and sentiment on Twitter and other social media platforms to judge the mood of the overall crypto market.</p>

      <p>According to Alternative.me, extreme fear could be an indication that the market is beginning to be oversold, and a swing to the upside may be on the horizon.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried. That could be a buying opportunity. When Investors are getting too greedy, that means the market is due for a correction.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Crypto analyst and economist Alex Krüger <a href="https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1197668732623106048">pinpoints</a> Bitcoin’s fall from nearly $14,000 this past June on short-lived euphoria triggered by President Xi Jinping who declared China’s support for blockchain technology.</p>
      <p>That pump has vaporized and China is <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/11/22/china-crypto-crackdown-continues-authorities-in-shenzhen-target-39-local-bitcoin-exchanges/">reiterating</a> its tough stance on crypto trading.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Some asked ‘why did this happen?’ A rationalization:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#1 China news used to drive price +42% (front-running expected new demand).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#2 Price dripped lower on low volume =&gt; increased demand never materialized.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#3 Sellers sold every single rip. They just did.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Fellow analyst DonAlt <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoDonAlt/status/1197820522031190016">says</a> today’s close is key and BTC needs to stay above $6,900 in order to trigger a relief rally and avoid another immediate big move to the downside.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Hit my above mentioned $6.9k support, now it’s time to wait &amp; see if we can close the daily above it.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>If yes, temporary relief up to 7700$ or even $8250, if not I’ll bid the HTF support around $6000.”</i>
