      <h2>A logistics firm is set to be given the green light to build a railhead at its Cannock depot – despite residents’ concerns the development will lead to an increase in noise and pollution.</h2>

      <p>Planning permission was previously granted for a railhead at the Pentalver site more than a decade ago.</p>
      <p>And a fresh application for a series of additions to the site, including a five line rail siding, was backed by Cannock Chase Council’s planning committee on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The existing depot is set to be converted to a multi-modal container handling facility and the site will be expanded onto the adjoining former Rumer Hill Industrial Estate. Trailer parking and car parking areas are also proposed, as well as a new two storey office building.</p>
      <p>Nick Matthews from Pentalver, who spoke in support of the application at Wednesday’s meeting, said: “The scheme has been an ambition of ours for 15 years, to develop a railhead.</p>
      <p>“It will allow Pentalver to contribute further to the development of a transport system, support the economic development of the area and ensure the Cannock depot remains competitive.The scheme will lead to the creation of 50 additional new jobs within the site.</p>
      <p>“While I acknowledge there are concerns surrounding noise impact arising from the site you have to remember the site was granted planning permission as a container depot with a rail head as long ago as 2005. We have noise controls in place.”</p>
      <p>Mr Matthews also spoke of a three metre high acoustic board around the proposed trailer parking area.</p>
      <p>But concerns have been raised by Rumer Hill residents about the impact of the development on their lives.</p>
      <p>Stewart Charlesworth, who spoke against the application at Wednesday’s meeting, said he had experience of working with the trains set to be used at the site.</p>
      <p>“These trains are noisy and polluting”, he said. “The mere nature of how they work is noisy; the engines are noisy and loading of the containers is noisy. Everything is metal on metal. There are no ways to move these trains quietly.</p>
      <p>“On an industrial estate it would work but Rumer Hill is a residential estate. In the summer you can leave the windows open at night and get woken up by the noise.</p>
      <p>“We want clean air and a good night’s sleep – that’s a basic need.”</p>
      <p>Committee member Councillor Zaphne Stretton said: “I’m really concerned for the residents that live in close proximity to the site. It’s a problem to them now – it’s going to be an even larger problem.”</p>
      <p>But the committee voted in favour of approving the application, providing no new material issues are received before the publicity period ends on November 28.</p>
      <p>Councillor Alan Pearson said: “We are talking about the residents, noise and fumes but this is already there. Business can’t cease because nobody wants business – business has got to go somewhere.”</p>
