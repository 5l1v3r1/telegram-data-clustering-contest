      </p>
      <p>Happy Friday everyone,</p>
      <p>My week was sadly dominated by the influx of tips I had coming in around <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/canndescent-laid-off-16-people-before-closing-series-c-2019-11">layoffs in the cannabis industry</a>. These stories are never easy to cover – you have to remember there are real people on the other end of the line, who depend on these jobs to support themselves and their families.</p>
      <p>There is clearly a consequence to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cannabis-investing-slump-stocks-fall-layoffs-fewer-deals-2019-11">the “green rush” mentality</a> that gripped investors and entrepreneurs in the cannabis space. We’re <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pax-eaze-weedmaps-hexo-canntrust-layoffs-job-cuts-in-cannabis-2019-10">telling that story as best we can</a> – and if you have a tip, please get in touch. We can talk about source anonymity, it’s something we take very seriously.</p>
      <p>And with that, let’s get to it:</p>
      <p>On the policy front, all eyes were on a certain committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Not impeachment – though yes, I imagine just a few people watched that – but a separate hearing the House Judiciary Committee held on Wednesday regarding the MORE Act, a far-reaching cannabis legalization bill.</p>
      <p>The bill, which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, effectively legalizing the drug, is the most comprehensive cannabis bill ever debated in Congress. While it passed the committee 24-10, its prospects in the Republican-controlled Senate are dim at best.</p>
      <p>Some industry experts say the hearing was held as a way to shore up support for more limited cannabis legislation, including the SAFE Banking Act and the STATES Act, which would protect banks that want to work with cannabis companies and states that want to create recreational cannabis markets respectively.</p>
      <p>My colleagues at Markets Insider <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pot-stocks-gain-second-day-following-key-marijuana-legalization-vote-2019-11-1028709673">have the breakdown on what the hearing meant for cannabis stocks</a>, which gained on the news.</p>
      <p>And last, a slew of US cannabis companies including <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/20/1950373/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Reports-Increased-Third-Quarter-Revenue-of-68-Million-and-Adjusted-Operating-EBITDA-of-14-1-Million.html">Green Thumb Industries</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curaleaf-reports-third-quarter-2019-financial-and-operational-results-300961273.html">Curaleaf</a>, or MSOs in industry parlance, reported earnings this week. They were <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/weed-stocks-slipped-this-week-after-round-of-disappointing-earnings-2019-11-1028693999">much more positive</a> than the big Canadian companies that reported last week.</p>
      <p>I also wanted to shoutout a fun video my colleague Joe Avella in BI’s LA office put together, visiting Lowell Farms, the world’s first cannabis cafe. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-r3bfU48L0&amp;amp;t=1s">Joe really, really enjoyed that cheeseburger</a>.</p>

          <i>Here’s what we wrote about this week:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/canndescent-laid-off-16-people-before-closing-series-c-2019-11">We got the internal memo that reveals why hot California cannabis startup Canndescent quietly laid off 16 workers just days before closing a big funding round</a>
      </h3>
      <p>More layoffs are hitting the cannabis industry. The California cannabis company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/canndescent-275-million-series-c-pitch-deck-california-cannabis-2019-9">Canndescent</a> laid off 16 employees on September 5, according to a memo obtained by Business Insider.</p>
      <p>“We are now well into the year and believe it’s important to make immediate changes to our operating plan in order to drive growth and control costs,” the company’s chief people officer, Kerry Arnold, wrote in the memo. You can <b><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/canndescent-laid-off-16-people-before-closing-series-c-2019-11">read the full memo here</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The company closed a $US27.5 million funding round five days later that valued the company at over $US200 million, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/canndescent-275-million-series-c-pitch-deck-california-cannabis-2019-9">Business Insider reported at the time</a>.</p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kpmg-pulled-in-9-million-from-canadian-cannabis-companies-2019-11">Accountants are making millions from the Canadian cannabis industry, and KPMG is leading the pack. Here’s how much each of the top firms is raking in.</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The largest accounting firms are making millions off the Canadian <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/latest-cannabis-business-news-2019-6">cannabis industry</a>.</p>
      <p>While accounting firms are often seen as staid, conservative institutions, they’re finding the burgeoning industry to be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/accountants-are-getting-into-marijuana-but-there-are-challenges-2018-12">a rapidly growing source of profit</a>. KPMG is leading the pack, pulling in $US9.3 million in fees from publicly traded Canadian cannabis cultivators, according to data provided to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>The complexities around the cannabis space – namely, rapidly changing laws, volatile stock prices, and the difficulties in valuing a plant that until recently has never been grown legally – mean that it’s a lucrative business for auditors, <a href="https://brocku.ca/goodman/faculty-research/faculty-directory/michael-armstrong/">Michael J. Armstrong</a>, an associate professor at Brock University’s Goodman School of Business and an expert on the Canadian cannabis industry, told Business Insider in an interview.</p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pax-eaze-weedmaps-hexo-canntrust-layoffs-job-cuts-in-cannabis-2019-10">Cannabis companies have slashed over 1,000 jobs in recent weeks as the industry contends with a ‘toxic’ landscape. We’re keeping track of all the cuts here.</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/latest-cannabis-business-news-2019-6">Cannabis companies</a> have been hit with a wave of layoffs in recent weeks, amounting to over 1,000 jobs across both startups and public companies.</p>
      <p>The layoffs come <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-medmen-pharmacann-blowup-is-a-disaster-for-cannabis-ma-2019-10">amid a broader downturn in the sector</a>. One index of marijuana stocks lost over 50% of its value since its high in January 2018.</p>
      <p>We’re continuing to keep track of those cuts here.</p>
