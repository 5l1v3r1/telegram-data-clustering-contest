      <h1>Chelsea fans will love the four-word message Mason Mount sent to Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea midfielder posted the clip on social media</h2>

      <p>Mason Mount has shared a video of himself taking a free-kick as a youngster.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea academy graduate was shown appearing to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick technique of striking the ball on the valve to generate swerve and dip.</p>
      <p>The Juventus forward notably scored that type of free-kick against Portsmouth whilst he was at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>And Mount, who has established himself as a regular in the Chelsea team under Frank Lampard this season, posted the video on his Twitter account on Friday, with the four-word caption: 'Thatâ€™s all you do... @cristiano.'</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old is heard on camera saying: "I try to base my free-kick on Ronaldo, hit the ball by the valve, and it moves. That's all you do.</p>

      <p>"Top corner. Top bins."</p>
      <p>He then proceeds to strike a perfect free-kick over the wall to applause from his young team-mates and coaches.</p>
      <p>Mount is set to play a key role for Chelsea as Lampard's side travel to Manchester City on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Blues can increase their lead over City by four points with victory at the Etihad Stadium, but Lampard says he knows it will be a difficult game.</p>
      <p>"For us to be in that position is something I am pleased with, I actually want more as well," <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/fixtures-results/frank-lampard-chelsea-jose-mourinho-17301534">he said in his press conference</a> .</p>
      <p>"I look at ourselves and don't consider others, only where we could have got more points too, and there are times where we could have done.</p>
      <p>"At the same time it is nice to be up there and around it.</p>
      <p>"It's a great test tomorrow, head to head to see where we're at. It won't be the end story, anyone can go to Manchester City and lose, they are such a strong outfit. That is what Pep Guardiola and the club have built over recent years.</p>
      <p>"So I won't be making huge judgements win or lose tomorrow without a doubt.</p>
      <p>"Our story is three months in the making, in terms of me being here and the young players. Their story has been four years and more of hard work from top to bottom."</p>
