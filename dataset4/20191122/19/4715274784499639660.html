      <p>The competition, which started in 2015, has since produced four winning artworks, and each artwork has been featured on a limited edition canister. Over 100,000 units of these special canisters have been sold worldwide. </p>
      <p>For this year’s run, Filipino artists are called to design Don Papa Rum’s label inspired by the island of Negros reimagined as Sugarlandia, where the dominant life force is its rich flora and fauna. The visual theme draws a magical realism of a lush and fertile land where not only sugar cane thrives but also a diverse ecosystem of plants and animals. </p>
      <p>Last year’s winner, Sam Penaso, represented by Renaissance Gallery, portrayed Sugarlandia in his work “Botany” using acrylic on a reflective stainless material depicting man’s coexistence with nature. He received a month-long artistic sojourn for a truly immersive experience in art. </p>
      <p>This year, the winner will receive a four-week artistic residence sojourn in Barcelona to be sponsored by the Bleeding Heart Rum Company, inclusive of roundtrip tickets, accommodation and allowance, and artwork features on social media, newsletters, and other channels of media.</p>
      <p>There will also be awards for Artistic Merit Award with a cash prize of P50,000, and People’s Choice Award with P15,000 cash prize. </p>
      <p>Prior to the announcement of the winner, the best 10 entries will exhibit their works digitized and mocked up into a canister displayed together with the original artwork for the Don Papa Rum Exhibit at Art Fair Philippines 2020.</p>
