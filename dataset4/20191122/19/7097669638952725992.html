      <h1>Jeffrey Epstein was not murdered, it was a 'perfect storm of screw-ups', William Barr says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:06:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vittoria Elliott</a></address>
      <p>The death of financier and paedophile <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> in August has been the subject of continued interest and debate.</p>
      <p>Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-york">New York</a> City on August 10, 2019 after being arrested on charges of trafficking of minors.</p>
      <p>His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner’s office, but many, including Epstein’s own defence lawyers, said that his death looked <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/epstein-death-murder-suicide-victims-hearing-1456397">“far more consistent with assault”</a>. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-homicide-autopsy-michael-baden.html">independent forensic pathologist</a> hired by Epstein’s family also disputed the medical examiner’s conclusion, saying it appeared Epstein had been strangled.</p>
      <p>Epstein, who had connections to some of the world’s richest and most powerful people and institutions, died before a trial would have revealed the full extent of his crimes. To many, this seemed highly suspicious.</p>
      <p>But in a conversation with the Associated Press, Attorney General <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/william-barr">William Barr</a> said that Epstein’s death was indeed a suicide, and the result of a <a href="https://apnews.com/4ff27f28f32d446795b65ac7dd8cc4ac">“perfect storm of screw-ups”</a>.</p>
      <p>Epstein attempted to take his own life in July and was put on suicide watch at the jail.</p>
      <p>The two federal corrections officers who were on duty the night of Epstein’s death did not perform the mandatory checks on Epstein. Both were charged this week with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-prison-guards-charged-with-falsifying-records-checking-inmates-day-epstein-died-by-suicide-2019-11-19/">falsifying records</a> indicating that they had regularly checked on him.</p>
      <p>Epstein, who had connections to some of the world’s richest and most powerful people and institutions, died before a trial would have revealed the full extent of his crimes.</p>
      <p>A 2018 Pulitzer-winning investigation from the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html">Miami Herald</a> revealed that Epstein’s abuse of young girls was well-known, but he received a sweetheart deal from Florida prosecutors in 2007.</p>
