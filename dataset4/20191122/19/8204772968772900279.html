      <p>A baby giraffe abandoned at birth has befriended a dog after being rescued and taken to an animal orphanage in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=South+Africa">South Africa</a>.</p>
      <p>Jazz the giraffe arrived at The Rhino Orphanage in Limpopo province just days after birth. A farmer found him in the wild, weak and dehydrated, and called the centre for help.</p>
      <p>Resident watchdog Hunter quickly began to care for the newcomer, and orphanage caretaker Janie Van Heerden said the pair bonded immediately.</p>

      <p>She said Jazz has been given IV fluids and his health is improving. He is being fed milk and is trying to eat leaves.</p>
      <p>She added: “Possibly soon he will be able to go home.”–PA</p>
