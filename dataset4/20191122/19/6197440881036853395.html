      <h1>[Update: Exits beta] Google’s Advanced Protection Program coming to G Suite enterprise users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:33:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>At the Tokyo edition of <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/12/12/google-cloud-next-19-tickets/">Cloud Next ’19</a> this July, Google announced that the Advanced Protection Program is coming to Cloud enterprise customers. G Suite and GCP users can soon take advantage of the company’s most <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/17/prevent-google-account-hijackings/">stringent security measures</a> against phishing.</p>
      <p><i><b>Update 11/22</b></i>: At Cloud Next ’19 in London <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/advanced-protection-program-high-risk-users.html">earlier this week</a>, Google announced that the Advanced Protection Program for enterprise will become generally available over the next two weeks. By default, all G Suite users <a href="http://g.co/advancedprotection">can enroll</a> in the program unless APP is disabled by admins.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Launched in 2017, the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2017/10/17/google-announces-advanced-protection-program/">Advanced Protection Program</a> is designed for users “most at risk” of account takeovers and other targeted online attacks. Like the consumer counterpart, there are three primary components to APP.</p>
      <p>Security starts at sign-in, with two-factor authentication/two-step verification from a security key required after entering your username and password. This ensures that you’re really the one signing into your Google Account by verifying a hard-to-spoof token. APP disables other 2FA/2SV methods, including authenticator apps and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/03/14/g-suite-disable-2fa-text/">SMS codes</a> as they can be intercepted.</p>
      <p>Google recommends that users register two keys to their account. One is kept on their person for mobile sign-in, while the other is placed in a safe location in case the first is lost. Any FIDO U2F security key works with the program, including Google Cloud’s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/08/30/google-titan-security-key-2fa-review/">first-party Titan device</a>, which is now <a href="https://wp.me/p9SZ9T-1gCi">available in four more countries</a> around the world.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Gmail and Google Drive access by third-party apps that haven’t been been explicitly marked as trusted by your company’s IT admins are blocked. This includes email clients that aren’t Google’s web or first-party clients.</p>
      <p>Advanced Protection Program also enables enhanced scanning of incoming email for phishing attempts, viruses, and attachments for malicious content. In Chrome, Safe Browsing will <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/08/06/advanced-protection-program-chrome/">scan for “risky downloads”</a> associated with certain file types.</p>
      <p>APP is available for G Suite, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Cloud Identity customers. Administrators can allow high-vulnerability employees — like IT staff and executives — to enroll. It’s ideal for government, finance, and other similar industries.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/07/advanced-protection-program-enterprise.html">enterprise Advanced Protection Program beta</a> will be rolling out in the coming days.</p>
