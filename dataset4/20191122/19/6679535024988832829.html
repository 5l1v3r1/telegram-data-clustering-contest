      <h2>‘It has come to deliver food items at a wedding performed at the temple’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:45:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sumit-Bhattacharjee-621/" target="_blank">Sumit Bhattacharjee</a></address>
      <p>The presence of a light commercial vehicle that was painted with slogans and symbols of an alien faith atop Simhachalam, close to the centuries-old Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple, created a flutter here on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Upon noticing the vehicle, which was allegedly parked close to the temple, the devotees alerted the priests and temple Executive Officer M. Vekateswara Rao.</p>
      <p>The officials immediately reached the spot and questioned the driver of the vehicle, who said it was a catering service that had come there to deliver food items to a person performing a wedding at the temple.</p>
      <p>“We let go the vehicle after checking the food items,” said Mr. Venkateswara Rao.</p>
      <h3>Inquiry ordered</h3>
      <p>There is a hoarding at the main entrance of the ghat road that leads to the temple, which clearly bans the entry of vehicles painted with symbols or slogans of an alien faith.</p>
      <p>“We have ordered an inquiry into it. We suspect that it is unintentional and a manual error,” he said.</p>
      <p>On the demand to introduce the declaration system on the lines of the one in the TTD, he said, “We have received some proposals and are examining the matter.”</p>
