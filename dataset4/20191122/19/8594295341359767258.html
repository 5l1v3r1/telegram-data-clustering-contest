      <p>Lexus’ first production electric vehicle carries a name that should spur fond memories of a boxy Mercedes-Benz sedan. Yes, the 300E was a desirable German car. Even today, the E 300e is a compelling electrified midsize alternative to those other sedans on the market.</p>
      <p>But we’re not here to talk about Mercedes-Benz, even though it’s hard not to when you name a new vehicle the 300e. In this case, it’s the Lexus UX 300e… and it’s <i>not for you</i>, as Corey would say.</p>
      <p>By “you,” we mean North Americans. The UX 300e unveiled this week in China will not make it to these shores; rather, the subcompact CUV will only be made available to buyers in China, Japan, and Europe.</p>
      <p>The big intro came Friday at the Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition — a trade show that understandably hasn’t gotten much press over here, what with the almost concurrent LA Auto Show and its controversial debuts. Front-drive in nature, the UX 300e is the first vehicle launched under the brand’s Lexus Electrified product strategy.</p>

      <p>Lexus boasts of the 300e’s “anxiety-free 400km” range, which translates to 249 miles on the New European Driving Cycle. Were it to come here, the EPA would rate it slightly lower.</p>
      <p>The added weight of the 54.3 kWh underfloor battery pack means a lower center of gravity for drivers, but it also meant changes were necessary elsewhere. Specifically, the platform needed additional braces, while the shock absorbers required a recalibration of their damping force.</p>
      <p>Power? It’s there, and it’s more plentiful that in other UX variations. The front-mounted motor generates 201 horsepower, with 221 lb-ft of torque on tap. Compare that to the 169 hp and 151 lb-ft in the entry-level UX 200 or the 181 combined horsepower in the UX 250h.</p>
      <p>Again, you can’t get one here, but Chinese and European buyers can expect to receive theirs sometime next year. Lexus has a different plan for America. While the brand hasn’t revealed (or even identified) a specific model just yet, it plans to tailor its electric products for the markets in which they’re sold. The little UX is right-sized for Europe and China, but U.S. customers might demand a beefier, more practical-sized EV.</p>
      <p>The EV introductions at this week’s LS Auto Show seem to back up that assertion.</p>
