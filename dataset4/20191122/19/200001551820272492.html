      <h1>Club announce deal with Leeds United for transfer ‘agreement’ will ‘not be signed’</h1>

      <p>With Victor Orta in charge of transfer business at Leeds United, links to Spain happen a fair bit.</p>
      <p>While there was an Italian connection during the Massimo Cellino era, things have changed since the director of football was appointed to help Andrea Radrizzani, and we’ve seen a number of Spanish players turn up at Elland Road.</p>
      <p>Kiko Casilla, Pablo Hernández and Samu Sáiz are some of the names that are still there or have passed through in recent years, and it seems the club are continuing this connection by trying to get agreements with clubs in Spain.</p>
      <p>That’s what the Javier Tejedor, the vice president of Spanish side Unionistas de Salamanca Club de Fútbol hinted at in the club’s latest assembly for club members, as relayed by <a href="https://www.salamanca24horas.com/texto-diario/mostrar/1641183/unionistas-queda-acuerdo-leeds-united">Salamanca24Hora</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“We reached an agreement Cultural y Deportiva Leonesa for the loan of a footballer and the same happened with Leeds United. If it isn’t signed, an agreement of collaboration will be signed that will include the possibility of the arrival of (mainly U23) footballers”.</i></p>
      <p>However, soon after that announcement was made, the club itself told one of their members that said agreement would finally ‘not be signed’, and revealed the possibility of the ‘agreement with Leeds was thanks to the contacts of Gorka Etxeberria (their director of football)’.</p>
      <p>Why this fell through isn’t stated, as a collaboration with a club like Unionistas could have been a good location to send youngsters like Guillermo Amor or Kun Temenuzhkov, who grew up in Spain before making the leap to Leeds United in recent years.</p>
