      <p>Revealed at the Guangzhou motor show in China, the electric UX is powered by a front-mounted 204hp electric motor.</p>
      <p>Lexus has revealed its first electric production car, the UX 300e, at the 2019 Guangzhou motor show in China.</p>
      <p>The electric version of the regular UX SUV, understood to be based on the electric Toyota C-HR offered in China, features a front-mounted motor that produces 204hp and 300Nm. Power comes from a 54.3kWh under-floor battery offering a claimed range of around 400km and fast charging at speeds of up to 50kW.</p>
      <p>The styling of the regular UX has been largely maintained, including the brand’s distinctive large front grille. The standard SUV’s alloys have been replaced by new, more aerodynamic units. The charging port replaces the conventional fuel filler. The EV also sits lower than the standard UX and features a new under-body cover to reduce drag. Inside too, there is little difference between the standard UX and the EV, save for the use of a new instrument cluster.</p>
      <p>The UX 300e features a number of drive modes so that the performance of the electric motor can be better managed, along with paddleshifters to control the regenerative braking modes.</p>
      <p>Lexus says the UX 300e, built on Toyota’s GA-C platform, has been developed with a focus on on-road performance, and the goal of offering a quiet and refined driving experience. To balance the new powertrain, extra bracing has been added with the dampers reworked to maintain optimum weight distribution.</p>
      <p>According to Lexus, the UX 300e’s powertrain draws on learnings from the firm’s long-running hybrid system, and features a temperature management system that balances power at low and high temperatures.</p>
      <p>There has also been a focus on refinement, Lexus claiming it has added insulation to reduce wind and road noise, with an Active Sound Control system that “transmits natural, ambient sounds to communicate the driving conditions”.</p>
      <p>The UX 300e will join Lexus’ international line-up next year.</p>
      <p>Moving to the Indian market, Lexus currently has five models on sale - four of which feature the company’s petrol-hybrid powertrains. The carmaker recently launched the long-wheelbase seven-seat iteration of its <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/lexus/rx"><b>RX SUV</b></a> and the brand's also considering bringing its <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/lexus/lc"><b>LC sports car</b></a> to India sometime next year.</p>
