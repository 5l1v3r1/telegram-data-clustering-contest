      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-star-andrew-whyment-becomes-new-favourite-win-just-one-episode-11198123/">Andrew Whyment is already the favourite to win</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> 2019 despite the fact that he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-new-campmates-andy-whyment-and-cliff-parisi-pose-with-aussie-wildlife-ahead-of-jungle-debut-11183275/">has only just entered the jungle</a>.</p>
      <p>It may have something to do with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> star’s hilarious <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-latecomer-andy-whyment-rummages-guts-offal-savage-first-bushtucker-trial-11194082/">reaction to finding himself in the thick of his first Bushtucker trial</a>, or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-viewers-cant-stop-laughing-andrew-whyment-fangirls-show-like-im-watching-telly-11197987/">his overall fan girl reactions</a> to pretty much everything so far owing to the fact he’s a huge fan of the show.</p>
      <p>It’s clear that Andy already think he’s won just by appearing on I’m A Celebrity, but whether he is crowned king of the jungle in a few weeks’ time or not, he’s already a winner thanks to his tidy fee for appearing on the show and the star already counts himself as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebrity-star-andy-whyment-thinks-hes-punching-with-his-wife-as-he-prepares-to-enter-the-jungle-11192967/">a ‘very lucky bloke’ on account of his wife</a> – cute!</p>

      <h3>How much is Andrew Whyment paid for I’m A Celebrity?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/andrew-whyment-coronation-street-leaving-11195818/">Soap star</a> Andrew Whyment reportedly got paid £100,000 to appear on I’m A Celebrity 2019, which according to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-star-who-getting-17295405">Manchester Evening News</a> makes him one of the better paid stars on this year’s show.</p>
      <p>They report that that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">Eastenders</a> actor <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/Jacqueline-Jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> are both taking him less than Andy at £75,000 each and rugby player <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> and Radio One DJ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele-roberts/">Adele Roberts</a> are both getting less again at £50,000.</p>

      <p>American star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> is reportedly earning the most from her stint on the show this year, pocketing an impressive £500,000 for her appearance, which works out at roughly £25,000 a day.</p>
      <p>While that sum is an eye-watering amount, it’s still not the most that has ever been paid to a celebrity for their involvement. That coveted title goes to TV host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/noel-edmonds/">Noel Edmonds</a> who is said to have become the highest ever paid celebrity to appear on the show having been apparently paid £600,000 to enter the jungle.</p>

      <p>‘I’m a very lucky bloke. We’ve been together 14 years and we just don’t argue. We get on so well.’</p>
