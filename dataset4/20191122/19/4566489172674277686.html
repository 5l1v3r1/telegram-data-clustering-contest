      <h1>British Airways 'welcomes' breakthrough in pilot pay dispute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:10:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Flagship carrier British Airways on Friday welcomed as a "positive step" a media report that it had reached a pay agreement with its pilots' union following damaging strikes.</p>
      <p>The airline has agreed to an inflation-proof pay rise of 11.5 percent over three years, according to the report in the FT newspaper.</p>
      <p>The BALPA union, which represents most of the airline's pilots, said in an email seen by the paper that its members would soon hold a ballot on the offer, with the union urging them to accept it.</p>
      <p>The airline was forced to ground its entire UK fleet for two days in September when pilots went on strike in the bitter and long-running pay dispute, and the breakthrough looks to have staved off the threat of a Christmas walkout.</p>
      <p>"We welcome this positive step," a BA spokesperson told AFP in a statement.</p>
      <p>Airline giant IAG admitted last month that recent historic strikes by British Airways pilots had hurt its performance in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Net profit sank nine percent to 1.0 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in the three months to the end of September from a year earlier, said IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia and Ireland's Aer Lingus.</p>
      <p>The London-listed company added in a results statement that it took a 155-million-euro charge from the cost of major disruption including industrial action by BA pilots in September.</p>
      <p>The two-day strike, on September 9 and 10, was the first time in its 100-year history that pilots employed by the airline had walked out.</p>
