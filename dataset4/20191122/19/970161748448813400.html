      <p>Since Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) returned to Albert Square without Stacey (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lacey-turner/">Lacey Turner</a>), the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/where-is-stacey-in-eastenders-and-has-lacey-turner-left-10877401/">question as to her whereabouts</a> and if she’s ever coming back has been on everyone’s minds.</p>
      <p>Martin was originally forced to go on the run with Stacey after she left <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phil-mitchell/">Phil Mitchell</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/steve-mcfadden/">Steve McFadden</a>) for dead, but he returned after Bex’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jasmine-armfield/">Jasmine Armfield</a>) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/what-happened-to-bex-in-eastenders-a-recap-of-her-suicide-storyline-10862068/">suicide attempt</a> to support his daughter.</p>
      <p>Tonight in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/eastenders-spoilers-martin-stacey-returning-lacey-turner-left-11195323/">Martin is set to get some heartbreaking news</a> when a visitor called Jerome comes to see him and what this visitor has to say will further throw Stacey’s return to The Square into question.</p>
      <h3>Has Stacey left for good or will Lacey Turner return?</h3>
      <p>Actress Lacey Turner has been absent from EastEnders recently because the star has been on maternity leave.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old welcomed a baby girl with her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/03/eastenders-lacey-turner-shares-sweet-tribute-husband-matt-kay-celebrate-second-anniversary-10673842/">husband, Matt</a>, in July and is currently enjoying adjusting to life as a mum and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/24/eastenders-star-lacey-turner-shares-rare-photos-adorable-baby-daughter-dusty-10801591/">spending time with her daughter</a>, who is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/29/eastenders-lacey-turner-and-matt-kay-reveal-miracle-baby-daughters-gorgeous-name-10479128/">named Dusty</a>.</p>

      <p>Although <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/is-stacey-pregnant-as-lacey-turner-returns-to-eastenders-for-a-one-off-appearance-10999104/">Lacey did briefly return from her maternity leave</a> to film scenes for the soap which saw <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/eastenders-spoilers-stacey-fowler-returns-as-martin-goes-to-extreme-measures-to-protect-her-10863705/">Stacey return to Walford in secret to see Martin</a>, we won’t be seeing the character again this side of Christmas.</p>

      <p>Stacey’s last visit to Albert Square didn’t go down too well, as she ended up telling Martin they were over after he said he had cheated on her. Although Martin was actually lying in order to try and protect Stacey and get her to leave Walford, his false confession resulted in a heartbroken Stacey ending their marriage.</p>
