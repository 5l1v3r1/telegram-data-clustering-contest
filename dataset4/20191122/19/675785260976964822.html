      <p>A mother whose unborn twins died at a hospital trust where more than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-mum-babies-died-nhss-20915148">270 infant deaths are being investigated</a> is calling for staff to face manslaughter charges.</p>
      <p>Kelly Jones received an apology and out-of-court settlement after Ella and Lola died at 36 weeks in 2014.</p>
      <p>Medics at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital missed opportunities to adequately monitor their foetal heartbeat, the mother claims. An inquiry, launched in 2017 by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, is examining more than 270 cases dating back to 1979.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Ms Jones, 33, of Monkmoor, Shrewsbury, said: “Every doctor and midwife who has caused a death should be held accountable for manslaughter and face charges.</p>
      <p>"This has destroyed people’s lives.”</p>

      <p>West Mercia police said they would wait for the full inquiry report before deciding whether to press charges.</p>
      <p>A leaked report shows that a "toxic" culture stretching back 40 years was in place when babies and mothers suffered avoidable death.</p>
      <p>Children were also left with permanent disability amid substandard care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.</p>

      <p>Staff at the trust routinely dismissed parents' concerns, were unkind, got dead babies' names wrong and, in one instance, referred to a baby who died as "it".</p>
      <p>In another case, parents were not told their baby's body had arrived back from the post-mortem examination, and it was left to decompose so badly that the family never got to say a final goodbye.</p>
      <p>Paula Clark, interim boss of the NHS trust, apologised to families and said improvements had been made.</p>
      <p>She added: “We have further to go.”</p>
