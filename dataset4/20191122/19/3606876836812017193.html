        <b>Several hundred Cypriots from both sides of the divided island marched on Friday to demand reunification as the Mediterranean country's two leaders prepared to meet for talks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci are scheduled to meet in Berlin on Monday alongside United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres.</p>
      <p>A German foreign ministry spokesman said Berlin was providing financial and logistical support for the "informal, trilateral" meeting but not playing a part in the talks.</p>
      <p>In Nicosia, one of the protest organisers, Christos Tombazos, told AFP: "We're here to press our two leaders to look for a creative way to restart negotiations."</p>
      <p>Some 80 organisations from both sides joined Friday's march, and said they were delivering a letter to the two leaders calling the Berlin meeting "a crucial opportunity to revive the peace process".</p>
      <p>"Cyprus is too small to be divided, but big enough to welcome us all," they wrote.</p>
      <p>In August, the leaders held an informal meeting in the buffer zone dividing the capital Nicosia, but failed to make any breakthrough in reviving talks.</p>
      <p>Turkey has had troops stationed in the country since 1974 when it invaded and occupied its northern third after a coup sponsored by the military junta then ruling Greece.</p>
      <p>The Greek Cypriot Republic of Cyprus controls the southern two-thirds of the island, which joined the European Union in 2004.</p>
      <p>Only Ankara recognises the breakaway self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).</p>
      <p>Turkey still maintains between 30,000 and 40,000 troops in the north.</p>
      <p>In 2003, crossing points opened along the UN-patrolled "Green Line" which had until then hermetically divided the island in two.</p>
      <p>Several rounds of UN-brokered talks on reunification have taken place down the years between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders, but they have always collapsed.</p>
      <p>Carrying signs reading "Status quo is a countdown to permanent partition", demonstrators said they were worried that the passage of time would make reunification impossible.</p>
      <p>"It's getting more difficult every day because of the number of settlers coming from Turkey," said Hulya Akbil, a Turkish-speaking Cypriot.</p>
      <p>The retired teacher said Turkish settlers now outnumber Turkish-speaking Cypriots in the north, and their presence is a major stumbling block to reunification.</p>
      <p>Many marchers on Friday stressed their shared common identity as Cypriots.</p>
      <p>"I'm a Cypriot who is Greek-speaking, but we are Cypriots first," said author and Unite Cyprus Now activist Marina Christofides.</p>
      <p>Monday's Berlin meeting is "an opportunity not to be missed", said Kemal Baykalli, a Turkish-speaking Cypriot and activist with Unite Cyprus Now.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately it's up to the leaders to make it happen," he said. "But we're here to say that we as Cypriots are ready."</p>
