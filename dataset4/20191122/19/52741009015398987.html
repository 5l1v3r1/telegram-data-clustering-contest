      <p>CALGARY — Alberta's energy minister says she had a productive meeting with Canada's newly appointed natural resources minister.</p>
      <p>Sonya Savage met with Seamus O'Regan, an MP from Newfoundland, this week during his first official visit to Alberta.</p>
      <p>She says he listened and appeared to understand the frustrations in Alberta.</p>
      <p>Savage says there are many issues that need to be addressed in the near future.</p>
      <p>Her priority is dealing with the CN rail strike, which she says is preventing 170,000 barrels of oil from moving out of Alberta every day.</p>
      <p>Savage says her other concerns include getting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built without delay, and changing two controversial federal bills that affect the energy industry.</p>
      <p>"It was a great opportunity to explain the very real problems that Alberta is facing," she said. "He listened, for sure, and I believe he understood.</p>
      <p>"In the months ahead, we'll see whether there is action."</p>
