      <p>The pub’s name is a nod to the club’s heritage as they celebrate their 125th anniversary this year. Ardwick AFC were renamed as Manchester City in 1894.</p>
      <p>A club spokesperson said: “Manchester City is always looking to develop innovative ways for our fans to watch football and is delighted to open a new pub, The Ardwick, at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>“The experience will give fans the opportunity to spend their matchday in the cosy, warm, classic feel of the pub mixed with the modernity of our Stadium for the live game.”</p>
      <p>With a capacity of 80, fans need to purchase tickets to enter but the price will include seats to watch the game from just outside the pub.</p>
