      <h1>Matt Barnes Details Story Where Ex-Warriors HC Don Nelson Had Team Smoking Weed With Snoop, Woody Harrelson</h1>

      <p>Along with being one of the best rappers to ever grace a microphone, Snoop Dogg has long been known as an expert weed smoker. If there were Madden ratings given out for weed smokers, he would be a ’99’ every single year.</p>
      <p>Former NBA player Matt Barnes had a very interesting story to tell about Snoop Dogg that involved weed, but it first started with his own head coach at the time.</p>
      <p>Barnes told Arash Markazi of the Los Angeles Times that ex-Warriors head coach Don Nelson wanted to celebrate after the ‘We Believe’ Warriors ended up beating the first-seed Dallas Mavericks in the playoffs, so he brought them all to a party that had numerous famous people just casually smoking weed.</p>
      <p>“We got up to [Don Nelson’s] penthouse in Lake Merritt and he tells us, ‘Woody’s in the back rolling doobies fellas, go back there. It was Woody [Harrelson] rolling doobies and our coach is telling us to go back there and smoke with him.</p>
      <p>Nelly had the whole roof and we go up and there’s Jessica Alba, Kate Hudson, Owen Wilson, and Snoop. We ended up going out to a club in San Francisco and lived it up after that and then we went back to Snoop’s hotel and blew it down.</p>
      <p>There was so much smoke in the room, they came knocking on the door and we were thinking, ‘Oh, damn, here we go.’ They came in, unscrewed the window, opened them up so the smoke went out, asked us if we needed anything and they left the room.</p>
      <p>I’d never seen anything like that before. Only Snoop. The legendary Snoop.”</p>

      <p>Don Nelson is an avid weed smoker, so him hanging out with a legend like Snoop should come as no surprise.</p>
