      <p>Neymar is back in the Paris Saint-Germain side to face Lille in Ligue 1 on Friday after recovering from injury.</p>
      <p>The Brazil forward has been out of action for a month after sustaining a hamstring injury while on international duty.</p>
      <p>But PSG coach Thomas Tuchel indicated in a pre-match news conference that Neymar was ready to return and he is in the XI to take on fifth-placed Lille.</p>
      <p>Kylian Mbappe has not been passed fit to start in attack with Neymar after recovering from illness, but is on the bench.</p>
