      <p>The online portal is available in lieu of media access to the force's encrypted radio system, which was removed earlier this year.</p>

      <h3>A Saskatoon police online information access point for media, launched at the beginning of November, has drawn attention from other cities’ police services looking for an alternative to provide news organizations with timely information in place of radio scanners.</h3>
      <p>The city police force launched a secure online portal with information that is automatically generated from dispatch call entries; professional members of the media now have access to it. The portal tracks 60 different types of calls, with general address information similar to the information available in media releases, and the time when officers were dispatched.</p>
      <p>The online portal is available in lieu of media access to the force’s encrypted radio system, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/police-seek-internet-based-access-to-info-for-media-after-privacy-commissioner-finding-silences-scanners">which was removed earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>It was introduced board of police commissioners at Thursday’s meeting, to much interest from board members.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t want to take away their radio access; there was no reason for us to do it aside from the fact that the legislation wouldn’t allow us to legally let them continue to listen to it,” Chief Troy Cooper said.</p>
      <p>In the past, when media had access to the police scanner channel, they could hear sensitive information, including a complainant’s name or the exact address where officers were being dispatched, he said. The media never used the information, but the fact that police shared it in the first place is considered a breach of privacy legislation, he told the board.</p>
      <p>“So, all we’ve taken away is the stuff that breached the privacy legislation, and they get exactly the same information,” he said.</p>
      <p>The force’s access and privacy officer assessed a long-standing agreement which granted the media access to “channel one” of its encrypted radio system, finding that it may have contravened provincial privacy legislation — something Saskatchewan’s Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ron Kruzeniski, advised was the case. Over the summer, newsroom police scanners in the city fell silent.</p>
      <p>The platform was developed in-house by the technology services department over the summer at no expense and requires no extra back end work, police spokesperson Kelsie Fraser told the board.</p>
      <p>Board member Mayor Charlie Clark expressed amazement at the online portal.</p>
      <p>“We’re the only service that’s figured it out without having to hire new staff — that’s great,” he said.</p>
      <p>Police forces across Canada, including Regina city police, have removed media and public access to their scanner channels.</p>
      <p>Regina police are looking to develop a web portal similar to Saskatoon’s. In an email, spokeswoman Elizabeth Popowich said they plan to have it ready for testing by the end of the year.</p>
