      <p>Thursday night, before a packed house at Tesla’s design studio in Hawthorne, California, CEO Elon Musk finally unveiled the electric “Cybertruck” he’s been working on since at least 2013.</p>
      <p>The event was action-packed, and I don’t say that lightly. It had lasers, fire, creepy animated figures, and even a Tesla ATV.</p>
      <p>But not everything went according to plan. The truck’s “armor glass” windows got smashed. Twice. On purpose.</p>

      <p>Ford’s not scared of Tesla.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-responds-to-tesla-new-cybertruck-elon-musk-2019-11">released a somewhat sarcastic statement</a> about Tesla’s Cybertruck, which came out the same week <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-revealed-los-angeles-photos-features-2019-11">Ford unveiled its all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s the first new Mustang-branded vehicle since 1964, and the SUV could be a real Tesla challenger. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-model-y-compared-photos-specs-2019-11">Here are the full specs</a>.</p>
      <p>The announcement came amid the Los Angeles auto show. Y<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html">ou can see all of the cool cars, SUVs and concepts on display here.</a></p>

      <p>The Boeing 737, a plane near synonymous with air travel, is no longer the king od the skies. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-beats-worlds-most-popular-plane-a320-737-2019-11">Airbus’ A320 has officially become the most popular plane</a> in the world, fueled in part by Boeing’s ongoing 737 Max crisis.</p>
      <p>Did I say 737 Max? You bet. There’s still no end in sight for the embattled jet. This week, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-shareholders-lawsuit-board-2019-11">Boeing shareholders sued the company’s board</a>, alleging “careless” handling of the plane’s development and the crisis that followed.</p>
      <p>Not all was lost for Boeing though, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-dubai-airshow-60-sales-2019-11">successfully inked a deal for 60 of the 737 Max jets</a> at the Dubai Air Show.</p>

      <h3>Holiday shipping heats up</h3>

      <p>There’s one week fewer between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, and that’s making things even worse (or better) as e-commerce becomes the dominant holiday shopping choice.</p>
      <p>Amazon’s in-house delivery network is set to face its biggest challenge yet, as the retail giant doubled down on competing with UPS and FedEx.</p>
      <p>Speaking of FedEx, you might have seen that the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html">paid $0 in federal income taxes</a> for 2018. That’s a point the CEO rejected, touting the company’s voluntary pension payment as an example of ways it’s helping invest in its employees and community.</p>
      <p>One slight problem: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fedex-income-tax-pensions-new-hires-2019-11">FedEx is slashing its pension plan for new hires.</a></p>

      <p>Uber’s founders are cashing out. Former CEO Travis Kalanick has now sold well over $1 billion in stock as he scales up his deliveries-only “ghost kitchen,” and his cofounder Garrett Camp has made significant sales too, according to regulatory filings.</p>
      <p>And, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-original-pitch-deck-shows-evolution-ipo-2018-12?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">insiders continue to sell</a>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/ubers-chief-product-officer-is-stepping-down/">soon-to-be former</a> Chief Product Officer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005602/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">Manik Gupta</a>, and Chief Accounting Officer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525321/000156218019005603/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">Glen Ceremony</a></p>
      <p>Seeking to calm the water, and give investors a vote of confidence, current CEO Dara <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/dara-khosrowshahi-spends-7-million-on-shares-amid-kalanick-sales-2019-11-1028709211">Khosrowshahi bought up $6.7 million worth of shares,</a> sending the company’s stock price soaring after hours.</p>
      <p>In other Uber news, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-safety-board-chair-criticizes-uber-for-2018-fatal-self-driving-crash-2019-11">US National Transportation Safety Board this week chided the company’s lax safety culture</a> as the cause of a pedestrian’s death after she was struck by an Uber self-driving car last year.</p>

      <p>In a bombshell 95-page lawsuit this week, GM accused executives of its crosstown Italian rival of bribing United Auto Workers officials in order to undercut competition and violating federal labor law in the process.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gm-fca-lawsuit-union-bribery-15-billion-damages-jpmorgan-2019-11">The allegations include a union-financed mortgage, swimming pool, an Italian wedding, fake charities, and more.</a>
