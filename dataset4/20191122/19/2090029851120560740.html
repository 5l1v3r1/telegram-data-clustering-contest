      <p>Lindsey Ann Hughes, was 13 weeks pregnant with a boy when she fell in her kitchen in Bangor, North Wales.</p>
      <p>She was rushed to hospital where she died almost two weeks later.</p>
      <p>An inquest heard the mum had broncho-pneumonia, which caused her to collapse and led to respiratory failure.</p>
      <p>Benzodiazepine, a drug used to treat as anxiety, seizures, and for alcohol withdrawal, was also found in her system, North Wales Live reports.</p>
      <p>Dewi Pritchard said at Lindsey’s inquest held at Caernarfon Coroner that an “abnormally high level eight times over the level for driving” of cocaine was found in her system.</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Cocaine damages the heart by killing off patches of heart tissue and causes a tightening of the vessels.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Even low levels of cocaine can cause catastrophic results and repeat use causes more and more damage.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He added it would have contributed to her death.</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>If she had not taken cocaine in the past the probability is that she would have survived the broncho-pneumonia, but we cannot be sure.<br/></i><br/><i>“Because of the broncho-pneumonia she died of natural causes, this is not a drug death, the cocaine contributed but did not ultimately cause her death.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>At the time of Lindsey’s death, her friend Helen Evans described her as “full of life” and a “devoted mother”.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination revealed Lindsey had pupil damage to her heart that is known as cardiac fibrosis and it can be caused by chronic cocaine use.</p>
