      <p>Musician <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">French Montana</a> was reportedly hospitalized in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> after police noticed he seemed ill while responding to a call at his home.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that the “Writing on the Wall” singer was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance Thursday afternoon after cops determined he needed treatment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Law enforcement</a> sources told the outlet that officers in the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department were called to his Calabasas, Calif. home after someone reported a robbery.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, that turned out to be a false alarm. However, the outlet reports that when officers spoke with the ex-boyfriend of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/kardashians">Khloe Kardashian</a>, they noticed something seemed off with him. The gossip site reports that Montana, 35, has been experiencing severe stomach pains, nausea, and an elevated heart rate recently.</p>
      <p>Representatives for Montana did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.</p>

      <p>He was reportedly taken to the San Fernando Valley hospital and is awake and alert after receiving IV fluid.</p>
