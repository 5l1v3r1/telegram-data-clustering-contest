      <h1>Opening date announced for new Lidl store in Patchway</h1>
      <h2>There'll be bargains galore after the ribbon-cutting</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:45:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>It will be the latest supermarket to open in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/patchway">Patchway</a>, and the growing Charlton Hayes suburb - and now the opening date for the state-of-the-art new Lidl has been revealed.</p>
      <p>The new branch of the German supermarket will open its doors - with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and everything - at 8am on Thursday, December 5.</p>
      <p>And Lidl bosses are offering some of what they are describing as ‘exclusive deals’ for the first three days that the store is open.</p>
      <p>These include a travel cot which will have £20 off - just on the Friday - and a toaster and kettle set, which is almost half price on the Saturday.</p>
      <h3>Where is the new Lidl going to be?</h3>
      <p>You’ll have seen it being built on Hayes Way in Northfield East, and it forms Lidl’s continued expansion plans right across Bristol and the rest of the West Country.</p>
      <p>The store will be a big one - with some 1,325m² of sales area, an instore bakery, toilets, baby-changing and 158 car parking spaces.</p>
      <p>It’ll be green too - there are 600 solar panels on the roof, and two electric car rapid charging points in the car park.</p>
      <h3>What do Lidl say?</h3>
      <p>Lidl’s regional boss Glen Stidever said the new store has created 40 new jobs, and is designed to mirror a nearby hangar from the old <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">Filton</a> Airfield.</p>
      <p>“We would like to thank all those who have played a part in bringing this new Lidl store to Patchway,” he said.</p>

      <p>“We have received excellent support from many local residents who currently have to travel out of Patchway, or Charlton Hayes, to complete their weekly food shop.</p>
      <p>“We have also worked closely with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire-council">South Gloucestershire Council</a> to design a store befitting to its surroundings, including taking design inspiration from the neighbouring Belfast Hangar, and constructing artwork designed by Bruce Williams depicting a Concorde in flight at the pedestrian entrance to the site.</p>
      <p>“It is great for us to be able to create more jobs and investment opportunities in the area, and we can’t wait to start serving our multi-award winning products to the local community,” he added.</p>
      <h3>Where will more Lidl stores be opening?</h3>
      <p>Last month, Bristol Live revealed that Lidl had ambitious plans to expand in Bristol, and were looking for sites for new stores - particularly in more affluent parts of Bristol.</p>
