      <p>Jeremy Corbyn was confronted by a furious audience member over anti-Semitism and abuse during the special Question Time general election programme.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader was challenged over the treatment of Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth who was heckled at the launch of a report into anti-Semitism by Marc Wadsworth who was later kicked out of the party.</p>
      <p>The man asked: "I looked at a video on YouTube and particularly because I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
      <p>He said: "Ruth Smeeth a Jewish MP was heckled out of that press conferences and there you are, at the end of the press conference, chatting happily to that same heckler.</p>
      <p>He added: "I don't understand how you can say you stand for human rights and free speech with that's how you support that labour MP at a labour press conference."</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately."</p>
      <p>The audience member interrupted saying: "Watch the video".</p>
      <p>"Nobody should suffer abuse and Ruth Smeeth and others have suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse," Mr Corbyn continued.</p>
      <p>He added: "It was a Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered because she stood up in public life.</p>
      <p>"I simply say to you that bad behaviour, misogynism, racism in any form is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party, or in our society."</p>
      <p>The audience member asked again: "Why were you talking happily to that same heckler" and "why would Labour female MPs need protection at Labour Party conference?"</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "I've had many conversations with Ruth Smeeth since then," adding: "You don't know what was said between us."</p>

      <p>Asked how he felt about the party being investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, he replied: "It's our process that is being looked at," saying that he welcomed it and the party had "placed ourselves completely open".</p>
      <p>He added that Labour had established the ECHR and promised to "fund it properly" in government.</p>
      <p>It came as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> faced a live primetime grilling from voters as the clock ticks down to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader were each due to be quizzed for 30 minutes by a BBC1 Question Time studio audience in Sheffield.</p>

      <p>Lib Dem chief Jo Swinson and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> ’s Nicola Sturgeon were also confronted with voters’ questions, hosted by BBC presenter Fiona Bruce.</p>
      <p>The leaders will drew lots to decide the appearance order.</p>
      <p>The format has proved tricky for No10 hopefuls in the past; in 2015 Ed Miliband stumbled off the stage after fielding questions for half an hour.</p>
      <p>And in 2017 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> was wounded after shouting at a nurse: “There is no magic money tree!”</p>
      <p>The TV showdown comes after Labour launched its manifesto, and on the eve of the Conservatives’ unveiling their ballot box blueprint.</p>
