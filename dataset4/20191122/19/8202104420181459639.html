      <h3>Global recycling markets may be changing, but the company picking up material at single-family homes is staying the same.</h3>
      <p>Saskatoon city hall announced Thursday it has reached an eight-year, $46-million deal with Loraas Recycling to continue providing the service to houses.</p>
      <p>While the company is remaining, the cost per household will rise considerably from $5.66 a month to $7.38 a month in 2020 and $7.47 a month in 2021.</p>
      <p>Russ Munro, the City of Saskatoon’s director of water and waste operations, told reporters at city hall on Thursday that the higher rates are driven by changes in global recycling markets, particularly for paper and cardboard.</p>
      <p>“The pricing on that has dropped about 40 per cent,” Munro said.</p>
      <p>Paper and cardboard accounted for 73.3 per cent of the material collected when measured by weight over the first six years of the previous contract.</p>
      <p>The contract with Loraas is the second since the program was introduced.</p>
      <p>Despite the extra cost, the city is removing a couple of materials from the recycling stream because of the difficulty in finding a market for them.</p>
      <p>Black plastics will be removed starting Jan. 1, as will paper coffee cups that are applied with a protective barrier known as polycoat. These materials account for about two per cent of the material collected by weight.</p>
      <p>Munro said he could not yet reveal how many companies had expressed an interest in the contract. City council must still approve the rates.</p>
      <p>The rates for the remainder of the eight-year contract should only rise by about the rate of inflation, Munro said.</p>
      <p>The contract with Cosmopolitan Industries to pick up recycling from apartments and townhouses runs through 2023. Those monthly rates rise to $3.71 in 2020 and $3.86 in 2021.</p>
      <p>The city says it has collected 80,000 tonnes of material since the recycling programs were introduced in 2012, the equivalent in weight of 5,700 buses.</p>
