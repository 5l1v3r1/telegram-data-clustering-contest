      <h1>New police chief wants Hong Kong university siege to end peacefully</h1>
      <h2>Dozens of protesters barricaded in campus with ‘many explosives and petrol bombs’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:05:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/peter-goff-7.4789661" target="_blank">Peter Goff</a></address>
      <p>Hong Kong’s new police chief said on Friday he had no deadline for ending a university siege that is entering its sixth day, saying the situation was still very dangerous but he hoped to resolve the stand-off peacefully.</p>
      <p>“There are many explosives and petrol bombs inside. The conditions are deteriorating,” said police commissioner <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Chris+Tang">Chris Tang</a>, who took over the top role this week following his predecessor’s retirement.</p>
      <p>“We hope to end the matter peacefully. We have not set any deadline,” he said.</p>
      <p>“To the people who remain inside, I think you do not want your family members and friends . . . to be worried,” he said. “I hope you can come out as soon as possible and solve the matter peacefully.”</p>
      <p>Dozens of protesters are still barricaded in the campus, following fierce clashes with police in the area last weekend.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of activists have left the university and given themselves up to police surrounding the university over the past few days, but a few diehards holding on have threatened to detonate explosives if the police storm the compound.</p>
      <p>Tensions are running high in the city as voters prepare to go to the polls on Sunday for district council elections, the city’s only fully democratic vote.</p>
      <p>The local polls usually receive scant attention but, following six months of increasingly violent protests, they are being seen as a key barometer of the government’s handling of the crisis.</p>
      <p>For the first time, all 452 seats are being contested, and the pro-democracy opposition hopes to gain significant ground off the back of widespread public anger at the government and the police.</p>
      <p>On Friday afternoon, clashes broke out between hundreds of anti-government protesters and a group of about 50 police supporters in the business district of Central.</p>
      <p>The two groups engaged in scuffles in the financial heartland, forcing riot police to move in to separate them and clear the area.</p>
      <blockquote>We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with president Xi. He’s a friend of mine</blockquote>
      <p>US president <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a> suggested on Friday he might veto legislation aimed at supporting the anti-government protesters in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Hong+Kong">Hong Kong</a>, despite the laws garnering overwhelming support from both the House and the Senate.</p>
      <p>The legislation requires the US to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong’s human rights situation in order to maintain its special trade status. It also bans sales of crowd-control munitions to Hong Kong, and authorises sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials deemed to be abusing human rights in the city.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Fox News, Mr Trump said he was balancing the human rights situation with his trade negotiations with China’s president Xi Jinping.</p>
      <p>“We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with president Xi. He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy,” he said. “I stand with freedom . . . but we are also in the process of making one of the largest trade deals in history. And if we could do that, it would be great.”</p>
