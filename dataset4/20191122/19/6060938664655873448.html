      <p>"She was 93 and she was having one problem after another. She was admitted to Kokikaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital, for certain days she was in the ICU and then she was out of ICU. It was all age-related," Javed Akhtar said.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately they brought her home. She wanted to come back to her own room she stayed for a day or two and then passed away. Shabana is in Mumbai," Akhtar, who is in the US, told PTI.</p>
      <p>The last rites will be held Saturday noon.</p>
