      <h3>Key Quotes: </h3>
      <p>“The oil market is acting better now and in the face of not so stellar data than it was in the days after the Saudi oil-attack which was one of the single biggest oil supply shocks in history.”</p>
      <p>“The Canadian rail strike is impacting crude shipments out of Western Canada as is the Keystone pipeline pressure reduction.”</p>
      <p>“Looking forward we remain confident that the fundamental oil data will improve in the weeks ahead and crude stocks in the US will decline to multi-year lows before year-end. In fact, it is worth noting that crude stocks on the US Gulf Coast slipped into a small year-on-year deficit in this week’s US Department of Energy inventory report despite registering a small build.”</p>
      <p>“We continue to put more weight on the recent quantitative developments for oil markets and the noticeable change in behavior and price dynamics as a result of momentum <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> turning “bullish” and the “Managed Money” crowd turning net buyers.<b> We continue to see scope for a strong rally in oil prices as we head into 2020.”</b></p>
