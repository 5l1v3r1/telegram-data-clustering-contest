      <p>I haven’t played CoD since Modern Warfare 2 around a decade ago, but dang it, the mobile game that launched a few weeks ago has got me hooked, bigtime. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344692-call-of-duty-mobile-android-ios/">Call of Duty Mobile</a> is a game that harks back to the best of the CoD franchise, with something for everyone from hard-charging assaulters, <s>campers</s> snipers, and the sneaky-sneaky types, along with some iconic maps. And now, an update is adding controller support, new maps, a new Battle Pass, and perhaps more importantly, Zombie mode.</p>

      <p>The arrival of Zombie mode means that the horde is on the way to mobiles everywhere, which means that productivity is likely to take another dive in the coming days and weeks as we defend ourselves against the undead. While it was stated in the Reddit announcement that new maps are incoming, we don’t know which ones will be added, so that’s a nice surprise waiting for us in this time of leaks and rumors.</p>
      <p>If zombies aren’t quite your thing, you might be more excited to find out that the missing support for gaming controllers is finally making an appearance in the very same update, which means the screen on your device will be a lot less smeary. As an addition, there’s also a new Battle Pass coming on November 25th, with details on that being announced closer to the time.</p>
      <p>The update is scheduled to roll out at the following times in these locations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Los Angeles:</b> Nov 22 – 21:00 PST</li>
