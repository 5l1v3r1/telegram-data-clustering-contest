        <b>Could it be as much of a success?</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/bohemian-rhapsody-movie"><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a> producer Graham King has secured the rights to make a film about Michael Jackson’s life.</p>
      <p>That’s according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-movie-bohemian-rhapsody-producer-john-logan-graham-king-1202792922/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, which reports that sources have confirmed that King has been given the green light by the late singer’s estate.</p>
      <p>King, who owns the production company GK Films, has reportedly retained three-time Oscar-nominated writer John Logan to write the script. <i>Deadline’s</i> Mike Fleming Jr added that the movie isn’t “intended to be a sanitised rendering of Jackson’s life”.</p>
      <p>The biopic is said to span the pop star’s entire life from child star in the <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-jackson-five">Jackson 5</a> to his death in June 2009. It’s said that the film will also address Jackson’s defence against allegations of child sexual abuse: <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/leaving-neverland-watch-michael-jackson-documentary-2444084">allegations of which were made in HBO’s 2019 <i>Leaving Neverland</i> documentary</a>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, <i>Deadline</i> is told that Logan, nominated in the past for Academy Awards for <i>The Aviator </i>(2004), <i>Hugo</i> (2011) and <i>Gladiator </i>(2000), will shape the script with King before setting it at a studio.</p>
      <p>As of April 2019, King’s<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/bohemian-rhapsody-has-made-nearly-1-billion-so-far-2476928#Dyep7YxYI3PsqUD2.99"><i> Bohemian Rhapsody</i> had made nearly $1 billion (£760 million) taking in box office receipts of over $900 (£687 million) around the world</a>.</p>
      <p>The Oscar-winning <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/queen">Queen</a> biopic had generated $901 million (£688 million) internationally, according to <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/box-office-bohemian-rhapsody-surpasses-900-million-worldwide-1203189204/">Variety</a></i>. Of those figures, it had been a huge hit in Japan where it has grossed $114 million (£87 million), a further $76 million (£58 million) in South.</p>
