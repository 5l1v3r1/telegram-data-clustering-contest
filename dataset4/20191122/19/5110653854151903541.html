      </p>
      <p><b>Sporting News:</b> When you were asked to lead this documentary, what were your initial thoughts?</p>
      <p><b>Deirdre Fenton:</b> Well, I was actually pretty excited. I come from 30-for-30, so I’m used to doing things that took place 30, 40 years ago. It is hard to chase after footage from that time (laughs). It was a blast because it was an embarrassment of riches with different angles from broadcast cameras, the Sky (Sports) broadcast, the Spanish broadcast. I just had so much to work with, and that was new for me. And that was super cool.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> I would assume that makes your job that much easier?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> It is because you get more genuine reactions from people. I think one of the benefits of doing something that happened a while ago is people really have a chance to formulate their thoughts on it. With something like this, it is the power of sports. People have that reaction to watching Ruiz win because it’s the story of the underdog pulling through to win, and seeing people have that excitement for Andy was really cool.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> How many times did you watch the fight to formulate the concept of the documentary?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> I watched the fight a bunch. But what I also tried to do is watch the interviews with “AJ” and Andy from around the fight because that gave me a really good idea of who they were, and that’s how I wanted to start it. I wanted to let them shine as characters. The majority of the film is the fight and people reacting to what’s happening. At the basis of it, it’s two boxers. Even though “AJ” is the overwhelming favorite, he’s not a villain. He’s a fan favorite. I didn’t want that to come across as such. I wanted people to see he has feelings too and where things went wrong for him.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> This wasn’t your typical 30-for-30 to where you had all this time to get it done. The turnaround had to be quick, considering the first fight was in June, and the rematch is taking place on Dec. 7. What comes about in formulating the game plan to get a quality documentary combined with finding the right people to tell the story?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> Bringing (Sylvester) Stallone in as an EPwas really a gamechanger. He came on, I think, in September. He’s amazing. He’s the best at telling these boxing stories. But then he was able to help us get Tyson, Strahan, Holyfield and Dolph. You can’t take your eyes off of Mike Tyson in this. He’s just so funny, engaging. The challenge was we only got those interviews about two-and-half, three weeks ago. The challenge is that restructuring around those pivotal interviews.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Watching the documentary, Mike Tyson really stood out more than anybody else. What was it like working with him?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> First of all, he likes to have salted peanuts and blueberries on hand. He even asked if he could take the peanuts with him when he was done. I was like, ‘Sure, champ. They’re all yours.’ Tyson doesn’t do a lot of interviews. I think the difference maker for this was Slyvester Stallone. He would tell him to use his hands and be animated. That’s where Sly helped not make the project, but make that interview specifically. I think people underestimate how smart he is. When you do an interview with him, he’s talking about quotes from the Bible, for some reason, telling us about the history of syphilis. He’s an incredibly smart guy.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Do you think the documentary would have had that little extra punch without Mike Tyson?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> I don’t think so. But I think you could say that about a couple of the interviews. The thing about Tyson is that you can’t take your eyes off of him. Every time he comes in, he’s in soundbites that are perfectly suited for this type of format.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> In terms of formatting, how do you know that you are goodand it’s done precisely the way you want it to be?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> I think when you first start reading the reviews (laughs). I think when you are in my position, and you’re living and breathing this, you kind of start of feeling like you’re a little too close to it. I trust the reaction of people I trust like my colleagues at DAZN because you are obsessing about clipping someone’s sound bite, you get a little lost.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> How much of the final editing process involved you and Sylvester Stallone?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> Would you believe he actually called my cell phone and gave me notes for 30 minutes last week? We engaged him because he’s one of the best storytellers in boxing. No one can do it better. You never know what you’re going to get from celebrity EPs. What we got from him is someone who was completely engaged throughout the entire process. He gave notes. He provided feedback. Ultimately, both of those things helped make it better. He’s a great teammate to have.</p>
      <p><b>SN:</b> Now that’s it completed, and you have had time to think about it, what’s the one thing you wish would have been on there that didn’t end up making the final cut?</p>
      <p><b>DF:</b> We were very limited because it is so close to the fight and the fact Ruiz came out of nowhere, and no one had really heard of him,I went down to Guadalajara and visited Ruiz’s camp. Some of the stories I heard from there really didn’t fit what we were doing — just hearing how close Ruiz was to quitting before the first “AJ” fight and the (Joseph) Parker fight (only loss of his career in December 2016). He was really close to giving up and doing something else. I wish there was a way to include some of that in the film, and we couldn’t figure it out.</p>
