      <p>Former President Barack Obama told Democrats at a California fundraiser on Thursday evening that he was open to higher taxes on rich people, including himself, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/obama-2020-democrats.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjennifer-medina&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;amp;pgtype=collection">according to a report in The New York Times.</a></p>
      <p>“I’ve got a lot of room to pay more taxes – and I already pay really high taxes,” he said. “That’s one area where, I guarantee you, where you will get Joe six-pack and the single inner-city mom agreeing. They would like to see a little bigger share of the pie and you know, the rent is too damn high.”</p>
      <p>He noted that the debate around taxes had changed significantly since the time he ran for president, The Times reported.</p>
      <p>Obama’s remarks come as the current slate of Democratic candidates propose a variety of higher taxes on the rich, including imposing new ones on capital gains and other Wall Street transactions.</p>
      <p>And Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-bezos-buffett-gates-zuckerberg-fortunes-warren-sanders-wealth-taxes-2019-11#what-sanders-and-warrens-wealth-taxes-look-like-1">have laid out plans</a> to implement a wealth tax in the United States that would hit the accumulated fortunes of the richest US taxpayers.</p>
      <p>Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7">previously reported</a> that Barack Obama’s current net worth is $40 million. Since leaving the White House, the Obama family have enjoyed a lucrative life with book deals worth at least $60 million, one of which produced a bestselling memoir from former First Lady Michelle Obama.</p>
      <p>They also signed a Netflix production deal last year estimated to be $50 million, <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/17/the-obamas-are-becoming-a-billion-dollar-brand/">according to the New York Post.</a></p>
      <p>As a former president, Obama earns an annual pension of around $200,000, and he’s made hundreds of thousands more from speaking engagements around the world.</p>
      <p>Assuming the $40 million net worth, Obama would be exempted from the Warren wealth tax plan, which starts with a 2% levy on net worths above $50 million. But he wouldn’t be spared from the Sanders tax, which begins at fortunes above $32 million at a 1% margin.</p>
