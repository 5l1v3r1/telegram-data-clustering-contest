      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Myles Stephenson has denied cheating on his ex girlfriend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> .</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> star, 28, has claimed that "it was a stupid mistake" messaging another girl but he is adamant he did not cheat as he and Gabby were "on a break."</p>
      <p>He also denied that he met with the woman he messaged, who was a previous ex, in an interview with The Sun prior to entering the jungle and revealed that bombshell Gabby found out because the girl told her she had exchanged texts with Myles.</p>
      <p>The star went on to say that he came clean as soon as the gym bunny confronted him - because he loved her.</p>
      <p>“We were on a break at the time when I messaged this girl, a previous ex", he said.</p>

      <p>"I shouldn't have done it, even though me and Gabby weren't speaking at the time and I moved home, but it was a general conversation.</p>
      <p>“I was a stupid mistake and I stopped speaking to her when we started getting back together, but by that time she's messaged Gabby and said we’d been speaking."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Myles was blasted by his ex when scenes showed him having a deep conversation with new pals Roman Kemp and Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>They opened up about love, with singer Myles confessing his fear that he will struggle to find a meaningful relationship, as he isn't sure if girls are only interested in him for his fame.</p>

      <p>The touching conversation saw Ian offer relationship advice to Myles about how to find "the one".</p>
      <p>But one person who wasn't convinced was Myles' ex, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby</a> .</p>
      <p>Gabby appeared on Love Island in 2017, and dated Marcel Somerville before they split, due to his cheating.</p>
      <p>She then starting dating Myles last September and they were together for almost a year, but split following reports she caught him messaging other women.</p>
      <p>So a furious Gabby made a few snarky comments on her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> after he claimed he was looking for true love.</p>
      <p>"OMG I'm dead", she wrote, alongside a photo of a leopard with Myles' face photoshopped on to it.</p>
      <p>"I'm not even watching the show but people are sending me things like this.</p>

      <p>"Saying meet 'meaningful Milo'.</p>
      <p>"Apparently he was on about 'meaningful relationships'.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure the guy knows what he's on about tbh.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know cheating, lying and a whole load of other [poo emoji] came under 'meaningful'.</p>
      <p>"Who knows? Each to their own."</p>

      <p>She also liked several shady tweets about Myles, including: "Rak-su guy talking about relationships being hard after winning x factor... must of been hard whilst cheating on <a href="https://twitter.com/gabbydawnallen">@gabbydawnallen</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
