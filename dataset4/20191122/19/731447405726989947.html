      <p>Ben Vida's next album comes out on <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=12162">Shelter Press</a> on December 6th. <br/><br/><i>Reducing The Tempo To Zero</i> is a four-hour drone album inspired by the American artist's daily ritual of ultra-focused deep listening and music making. It was composed and edited across four years, from 2015 through 2019, and is a spiritual successor to Vida's 2016 album, <i>Damaged Particulates</i>. It comes in digital formats as well as a USB card. <br/><br/>Vida has previously released on Shelter Press, as well as labels like iDEAL, PAN and Nihilist. <br/><br/>Shelter Press is the label and book publisher run by French artist FÃ©licia Atkinson. Earlier this year it released her acclaimed album, <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/23941"><i>The Flower And The Vessel</i></a>, as well as <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/23574">an LP</a> from JAG. <br/><br/>Listen to an extract from <i>Reducing The Tempo To Zero</i>.</p>
