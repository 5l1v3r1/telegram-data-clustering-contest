      <h1>From photographer to CM, Uddhav's journey to the top</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:38:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/mrityunjay-bose" target="_blank">Mrityunjay Bose</a></address>
      <p>From being an ace photographer to getting closer to becoming the chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray has come a long way.</p>
      <p>The big challenge that he faced was that as being a political heir to his father Bal Thackeray,  he is often compared with the late charismatic leader and one of the most powerful orators. </p>
      <p>Balasaheb had founded Shiv Sena in 1966.</p>
      <p>Once known for his soft image,  the 59-year-old Uddhav ji, as he is popularly known, has emerged as a tough leader, who could openly challenge the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo.<br/>At the meeting of Shiv Sena,  NCP and Congress,  he was the unanimous choice for the post of CM.</p>
      <p>In case,  if he accepts,  he would become the first from the Thackeray family to assume the post of power,  which otherwise is known to run governments through "remote control".</p>
      <p>As the Shiv Sena president or 'Shiv Sena pramukh',  he is quite balanced and have an extremely modern and professional approach,  and is often seen carrying a tab which has all finer details at his fingertips.</p>
      <p>Born on 27 July 1960,  to Balasaheb and late Meenatai,  he was their third child after Bindumadhav or Binda and Jaidev.  </p>
      <p>He was named 'Dinga' by uncle, late Shrikant Thackeray,  the father of his cousin Raj Thackeray.  </p>
      <p>In fact, Uddhav's mother Meenatai and Raj's mother Kunda are sisters.  In fact,  his aunt named him 'Shravanbal',  an ideal son,  as he was the most obedient among brothers and cousins.</p>
      <p>Uddhav is a graduate from the famous JJ School of Arts and so as Raj.</p>
      <p>In the nineties, particularly between 1995-99 when the erstwhile Shiv Sena-BJP government was in power,  Uddhav and Raj,  accompanied Balasaheb at public functions. </p>
      <p>In 2003,  at the party's conclave in the hill town of Mahabaleshwar,  it was Raj who proposed Uddhav's name as the executive president of the party. Balasaheb was then 76.</p>
      <p>Slowly,  he started taking over the functioning of the party at the instance of his father.</p>
      <p>The first tiff was with veteran Narayan Rane,  a former chief minister and leader of the opposition, who had to be expelled by the Sena supremo.</p>
      <p>A major minus for him was that he cannot keep his cousin,  Raj,  in the party fold,  the later rebelled and floated Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. </p>
      <p>In 2014, the Shiv Sena and BJP contested against each other but came to form the government after the polls. But,  Uddhav was always assertive continued to target Modi-Shah even while being in government.  </p>
      <p>When in December 2014, the BJP-Sena government started off, he shared excellent relations with CM Devendra Fadnavis but after the tussle for the top job,  their relations soared.</p>
      <p>During the 2019 polls and the last annual Dassera rally,  he made it public that a Shiv Sainik would be the next CM,  which now is realised.</p>
      <p>He has come out with two photo books - Maharashtra Desh (2010) and Pahava Vitthal (2011). His expertise is in aerial photography and wildlife photography.</p>
      <p>Uddhav is married to Rashmi and has two sons Aditya,  an MLA and Tejas, a wildlife enthusiast and conservationist. </p>
