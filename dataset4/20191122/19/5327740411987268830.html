      <p>Surrey Mounties are trying to identify a man accused of groping staff at a Guildford area business back in September.</p>
      <p>This is alleged to have happened on Sept. 15, in the 10300-block of 152nd Street.</p>
      <p>Police say they received a report that a South Asian man believed to be between the ages of 50 and 60, with a long beard and wearing an orange turban, “groped and kissed” a woman there.</p>
      <p>Constable Richard Wright said the suspect then allegedly “made inappropriate comments towards her before leaving the business.</p>
      <p>“These incidents can have a profound impact on the victims and their loved ones,” he said. “Police are asking for help to identify this suspect to further the investigation and to bring a measure of closure to the victim.”</p>
      <p>Police ask anyone who can identify the suspect to contact the Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.</p>
