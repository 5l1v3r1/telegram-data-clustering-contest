      <h1>Uruguay prepares to shun left in presidential vote</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:40:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author">Mauricio RABUFFETTI (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>A conservative opposition candidate is favored to win Uruguay's presidential election run-off Sunday as the South American country prepares to turn its back on the left after 15 years in power.</p>
      <p>Luis Lacalle Pou, leader of the center-right National Party, trailed ruling party candidate Daniel Martinez in the first round, but a voting pact with lower-placed candidates has given him a significant opinion poll lead.</p>
      <p>The latest poll shows Lacalle Pou, a 46-year-old former senator, would take 51 percent of the vote, with ex-Montevideo mayor Martinez on 43.</p>
      <p>The run-off is effectively a referendum on 15 years of rule by the Broad Front -- or Frente Amplio -- according to Diego Lujan, a political scientist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo.</p>

      <p>"When you have a party that has been in government for three terms, with a parliamentary majority that can implement its progam, the party is responsible for its results," Lujan told AFP.</p>
      <p>The Broad Front's previous election victories came during periods of growth in Uruguay, but it now faces a backlash from voters angered by a stagnant economy, inflation of 7.5 percent and an unemployment rate of 9.0 percent</p>
      <p>-'No more taxes'-</p>
      <p>Lacalle Pau has tapped in to voter concerns over the country's high tax rates, and promised to look elsewhere to raise the $900 million needed to reduce the public deficit -- currently running at 4.9 percent of GDP.</p>

      <p>"Uruguay can't bear any more taxes," he told supporters.</p>
      <p>In this country known to be one of the safest in Latin American, rising crime rates are at the top of voters' concerns.</p>
      <p>Uruguay has long been considered a bastion of peace and stability in an often turbulent region.</p>
      <p>But security has been declining, with a sharp rise in some violent crimes reported last year.</p>
      <p>In 2018, South America's second-smallest country registered a record 414 murders, up 45 percent on the year before.</p>

      <p>The Broad Front, a coalition of leftist movements, can point to a record of progressive government since it broke a decades-long conservative stranglehold on government in 2005.</p>
      <p>Uruguay stood out on the international stage by approving abortion, gay marriage and the small nation pioneered the legalization of cannabis in 2013.</p>
      <p>"But this third government of the Broad Front has little claim on success," said Lujan.</p>
      <p>As Lacalle Pau -- the son of a former Uruguay president Luis Alberto Lacalle -- made pacts with veteran politicians like Ernesto Talvi of the Colorado party and right-wing figure Guido Manini Rios, Martinez was left with nowhere to turn.</p>
      <p>"Three consecutive terms in which it enjoyed a parliamentary majority has meant they weren't used to looking to other parties for support," said Lujan. "But the opposition parties want change."</p>
      <p>Martinez, 62, turned to party icon Jose Mujica earlier this month in a bid to boost his appeal, tapping the former president and guerrilla leader as his next agriculture minister should he win.</p>
      <p>But enlisting the 84-year-old to the cause has failed to have a significant impact on Martinez's poll standings.</p>
      <p>The party still hasn't shaken off the 2017 scandal that forced the resignation of Vice President Raul Sendic, who was tried for embezzlement and abuse of power.</p>
      <p>The scandal flew in the face of "a very ethical and very refreshing discourse" that the coalition brought to power in 2005, said Lujan.</p>
      <p>Some 2.6 million voters are called to the polls Sunday. The next president will take office in March for five years.</p>
