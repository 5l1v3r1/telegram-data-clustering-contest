      <h1>Indonesian track and field proteges Karisma, Zohri showered with bonuses for breaking records</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:41:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Dicky Christanto Wulandaru</a></address>
      <p>All the hard training paid off when two Indonesian runners, Lalu Muhammad Zohri, 19, and para-athlete Karisma Evi Tiarani, 18, were awarded cash bonuses by the Indonesia Athletics Federation (PASI).</p>
      <p>Karisma, who competed in the 100-meter women's race in the T63 (athlete with single through knee or above knee limb deficiency competing with a prosthesis) category, was awarded a Rp 100 million bonus after recently breaking a world record at the 2019 World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai. Karisma booked 14.72 seconds.</p>
      <p>Zohri, who competed at the World Athletics Championships, also in Dubai, broke the Southeast Asian record, being the second-fastest man in the semifinal by booking 10.15 seconds, passing compatriot Suryo Agung, who was previously dubbed the fastest man in the region after booking 10.17 seconds. Zohri received a Rp 360 million bonus.</p>
      <p>“I never thought I would reach this point, breaking the world record, with seniors as opponents. I am very grateful. I don’t know what I'll do with the money, except save it for a rainy day,” Karisma told <i>The Jakarta Post</i> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Karisma said she was considering continuing her studies to obtain an undergraduate degree at a university in Surakarta, Central Java, next year.</p>
      <p>Zohri said he would use the money to open a business.</p>
      <p>“We can’t thank <i>Pak</i> Muhammad Hasan enough as he is the one who struggled to provide us with these cash rewards,” Zohri said, referring to PASI chief Muhammad "Bob" Hasan.</p>
      <p>Hasan previously told the <i>Post</i> that cash bonuses were intended to keep athletes motivated so that they could reach higher levels in their sport.</p>
