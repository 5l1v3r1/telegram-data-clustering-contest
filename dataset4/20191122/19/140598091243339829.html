      <h1>Richard Freeman's barrister calls on Daily Mail to release Shane Sutton affidavit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:10:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-cary/" target="_blank">Tom Cary</a></address>
      <p>Dr Richard Freeman’s lawyer has urged the General Medical Council to put pressure on <i>the Daily Mail</i> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/11/21/richard-freemans-lawyer-says-claim-team-sky-doctor-ordered-testosterone/">to release a document she believes could help her client</a>. </p>
      <p>On a day when technical gremlins meant the panel in Freeman’s medical tribunal was unable to hear from endocrinologist Dr Richard Quinton, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/11/21/dr-richard-freeman-downloaded-research-documents-ordering-banned/">Mary O’Rourke QC said she wanted the GMC to “pursue an obtaining order” for the alleged document</a>.</p>
      <p>Dr Freeman, who left British Cycling in October 2017, is charged with ordering testosterone gel in May 2011 knowing or believing it was for use by an athlete to improve performance. He faces being struck off if found guilty.</p>
      <p>Dr Freeman denies this and claims he was bullied into ordering the testosterone by former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton. He claimed Sutton asked for the testosterone to treat erectile dysfunction.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/11/13/farcical-unedifying-day-will-live-cycling-infamy-shane-sutton/">In surreal scenes last week, Sutton furiously denied those claims before storming out of the hearing, accusing Freeman</a> - who was sitting behind a screen as he is being treated as a ‘vulnerable witness’ - of being “spineless”.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke now says the Australian’s evidence should not be submitted to the panel because he is a serial liar. And she says <i>the Daily Mail</i> may have a document which supports her claim.</p>

      <p>O’Rourke has already submitted a request to <i>the Daily Mail</i> under Section 35a of the Medical Act to disclose an alleged witness statement or affidavit which she claimed was signed by Sutton.</p>
      <p>She says the document "contains a number of lies" and is "inconsistent" with Sutton's subsequent evidence to a parliamentary committee inquiry into doping in sport.</p>
      <p>The newspaper has acknowledged receipt of the request, but O'Rourke called on the GMC to "pursue an obtaining order" for the alleged document. </p>
      <p>The tribunal has been adjourned until Monday morning. Dr Quinton had been due to give evidence on Friday via video link but this was delayed by technical issues. He has now been asked to try again on Monday.</p>
