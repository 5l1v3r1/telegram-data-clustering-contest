      <p>POLICE yesterday banned yet another MDC rally that was set to be held in Chitungwiza's Zengeza East constituency - the third such opposition event to be prohibited in a fortnight - as the democratic space in the country dwindles, the Daily News reports.<br/><br/>Of late, authorities have been making it impossible for the Nelson Chamisa-led MDC to carry out any events, including rallies and other party activities, citing failure to comply with the Maintenance of Peace and Order Act (Mopa).<br/><br/>MDC MP for the area, Goodrich Chimbaira, said he had notified police in Chitungwiza of his intention to hold a rally on Sunday at Unit H Shopping Centre to give feedback on what has been happening in Parliament to his constituency.<br/><br/>However, the officer commanding police in Chitungwiza district, one S Mujiwa, denied them the right to go ahead, saying the MDC had not complied with provisions of the law.</p>
