      <p>Using figures from <i>Celebrity Net Worth, Forbes</i> and <i>The Richest</i>, money and entrepreneurship website <i>Wealthy Gorilla</i> recently conducted a study to see which footballers – past and present – rank as the richest players of all time from their football and football-related activities.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly given the financial boom in modern-day football, a number of present-day stars feature prominently in the top 10, although legends such as David Beckham, Francesco Totti and Pele also made the cut.</p>

      <p>Juventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo comes out joint-top with Beckham, who turned out for the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid and who currently owns Inter Miami CF, with both icons boasting a reported net worth of about $450 million (R6.5 billion).</p>
      <p>Ronaldo's long-time rival and current FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi completes the top three, with the Argentina international said to be worth a neat $400 million (R5.8 billion) from his playing career and commercial sponsorships.</p>
      <p>Fourth-placed Dave Whelan is undoubtedly the odd one out on the list. The former Blackburn Rovers and Crewe Alexandra defender earned his wealth through the ownership of Championship side Wigan Athletic, and their sister Rugby Club Wigan Warriors, and has accumulated a net worth of about $220 million (R3.2 billion).</p>
