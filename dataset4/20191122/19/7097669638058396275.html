      <p>A Los Angeles County school shooting threat was foiled after deputies seized a student’s AR-15 rifle, target list and more, Southern California authorities said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Deputies with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Century station “responded to a call of a student who <a href="https://twitter.com/LASDMurakami/status/1197923063859310592">threatened to shoot other students and staff</a>,” Los Angeles County Undersheriff Tim Murakami said in a tweet Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Murakami said a search warrant led to the seizure of the AR-15, as well as “ammunition, list of intended victims and a drawing of the school layout.”</p>
      <p>Authorities also found “<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/School-Shooting-Threat-Southern-California-Los-Angeles-AR-15-Rifle-565334701.html">silencers and body armor</a> in what was described by authorities as an averted school shooting,” NBC Los Angeles reported.</p>
      <p>Murakami did not name the school involved in the threat but said there would be a press conference on the incident on Friday at 11:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>The Century station is <a href="https://lasd.org/century/">based in Lynwood</a> and covers Florence/Firestone, Walnut Park, Willowbrook and Athens Park, according to the Sheriff’s Department.</p>
      <p>KABC reported that the <a href="https://abc7.com/5713503/">school involved was in South Los Angeles</a>.</p>
