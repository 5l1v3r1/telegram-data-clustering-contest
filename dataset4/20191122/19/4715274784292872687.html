      <p>Cresendo, located in Brgy. Central near the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) and MacArthur Highway, will be developed into a modern local community that builds on local components resembling a new población or “bayan” infused with modern conveniences. The project will have a 30-hectare urban core comprised of a 1.5-hectare central plaza, school, commercial center, and a church. <b>Putting people first</b> “The urban core of Cresendo is master-planned to put people first,” explained John Estacio, Cresendo estate head (Seen in photo). “It creates vibrant, safe and interesting walking paths around the community. One can peruse ground floor retail while walking around the neighborhood, or cross over to pocket parks and promenades, view public art and installations from the plaza, to the church, the market or the school.” Surrounding the Cresendo central plaza will be a commercial district made up of commercial buildings ranging from 500 sqm to 2,000 sqm. The smaller commercial lots categorized as shophouses, are envisioned to give rise to homegrown enterprises and inspire entrepreneurship. Business owners or employees can live right above their stores, service shops, training centers or processing centers. </p>

      <p>A 1.5-kilometer greenway leads from the central plaza all the way to the 7-hectare River Terraces near the residential areas. With dedicated pedestrian lanes and bike lanes, it will seamlessly connect the estate’s active urban core to the quieter, residential living zones. Roads will be lined with trees endemic to the area.  Three-meter wide sidewalks and arcaded walkways will all be part of the estate’s pedestrian-friendly design. Pocket parks and pedestrian promenades will be engaging and easily accessible for estate residents and visitors. Don Bosco Technical Institute will open a senior high school in Cresendo, followed by its Technical Vocational Education and Training Center. The institution will be the first of its kind in Tarlac, accommodating about 5,000 students. It will equip graduates with the technical proficiency and specialized skill set that will be required in the industrial park, and the commercial developments within and around the estate. <b>Mid-range housing on tap</b></p>

      <p>ALI residential brand Avida Land will be the first to build residential villages on the estate. Residents will benefit from their neighborhood’s proximity to the River Terraces where they can enjoy relaxing leisure activities. Avida’s mid-range house and lot offerings are expected to attract home buyers from Tarlac, Metro Manila and abroad, especially those with roots in the province. “Tarlac City is a next wave city that benefits from a number of government infrastructure projects,” said Estacio. “It has a young and growing population and it also lies in the main transport corridors from Manila to Northern and Central Luzon.” <b>Industrial park for light. medium-scale businesses</b></p>

      <p>Providing more employment opportunities in the area will be the 32-hectare Cresendo Industrial Park (CIP). CIP will have various lot sizes ranging from 1,200 sqm to 10,000 sqm for sale at P6,000 to P9,000 per sqm. This will be open to locators in light to medium, non-polluting industries by 2022. In full swing, the industrial park is expected to generate approximately 2,000 jobs.</p>
