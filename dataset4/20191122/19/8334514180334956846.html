      <p>(Reuters) - British Airways and its pilots’ union BALPA have reached a preliminary agreement to end the pay dispute that resulted in the first walkout by pilots in the airline’s history, the union said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The agreement came after the two sides held talks under the auspices of the ACAS arbitration service.</p>
      <p>BALPA said in a statement: “We can confirm that BALPA, BA and ACAS have put together a new pay and conditions proposal and, subject to final checks, BALPA expects it will shortly be consulting its 4,000 BA members on them.”</p>
      <p>A BA spokeswoman said “We welcome this positive step.”</p>
      <p>As part of the agreement, BA agreed to insert an inflation protection clause to its previous pay offer of an 11.5% rise over three years, the Financial Times reported.</p>
      <p>The airline also offered improvements to working conditions, rostering and flight bonuses, the paper added.</p>
      <p>British Airways pilots went on strike for 48 hours in September, grounding 1,700 flights.</p>
      <p>BA, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ICAG.L">ICAG.L</a>), said in September that the strikes had cost it 137 million euros ($151 million).</p>
