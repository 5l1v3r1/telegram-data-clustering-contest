      <h1>Kilwinning Rangers boss Chris Strain says bigger squad may be required to maintain Premiership charge</h1>
      <h2>The Buffs are five points clear at the top of the table but Strain says tough tests lie ahead for his young side - starting with a trip to Kilbirnie.</h2>

      <p>Chris Strain reckons the next month will provide a true test of Kilwinning Rangers’ title credentials.</p>
      <p>The Buffs extended their lead at the top of the West Premiership to five points on Saturday with a 2-1 win at home to Clydebank.</p>
      <p>But boss Strain is refusing to get carried away, with a tough run of fixtures against the likes of Kilbirnie, Irvine Meadow, Auchinleck Talbot and Hurlford on the horizon.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’re on a good run at the moment, the boys are working really hard, and I thought we were excellent against Clydebank.</p>
      <p>“We’ll soon be in a position where we’ve played most of the teams in the top half of the league twice.</p>
      <p>“With the games we’ve got coming up, in three or four weeks time we’ll know if there’s an opportunity to kick on.</p>
      <p>“But listen, we’ve miles to go. We’ve been in better positions than this before and thrown it away so no-one here is getting ahead of themselves.</p>
      <p>“What’s pleasing me most is that our discipline and behaviours have been excellent.</p>
      <p>“My only concern is that the squad is very thin. We might have to eventually look at bringing in one or two bodies.”</p>
      <p>Kilbirnie away awaits Buffs this weekend and Strain added: “Our record there is very patchy. It’s going to be another very difficult afternoon.”</p>
