      <h1>Bears Insider Has Encouraging Update On QB Mitch Trubisky</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:42:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Even though Mitch Trubisky suffered a hip injury in Week 11, the third-year quarterback for the Chicago Bears is ready to play this weekend.</p>
      <p>Trubisky was pulled out of the game in the fourth quarter last Sunday for Chase Daniel. Head coach Matt Nagy said he made the switch because the former first-round pick was dealing with a hip pointer.</p>
      <p>Several fans were questioning the legitimacy of Trubisky’s injury, especially since he’s struggled this season. Well, the latest report from the Bears will most likely add fuel to their argument.</p>
      <p>It turns out that Trubisky was a full participant at practice for the third-straight day, per NBC’s JJ Stankevitz.</p>
      <p>The expectation in Chicago is that Trubisky will start this weekend against the New York Giants.</p>
      <p>He’s not even listed as questionable on the team’s final injury report.</p>

      <p>If Trubisky’s injury resurfaces on Sunday, the Bears could bench him. They could also bench him if he struggles to perform against an abysmal Giants defense.</p>
      <p>The Bears are having a disappointing season in large part because of their inability to score points on a consistent basis.</p>
      <p>Not only does Trubisky need to play well to keep his team’s playoff hopes alive, he’ll have to prove to the coaching staff that he can be the starting quarterback in 2020.</p>
      <p>We’ll see if Trubisky can bounce back this Sunday.</p>
