      <p>The United Nations <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html">Yemen</a> envoy Martin Griffiths has told the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">UN</a> Security Council that the number of air attacks by the Saudi-led coalition battling the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/houthis.html">Houthi rebels</a> has dropped by nearly 80 percent in the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>The coalition, which intervened in the war in 2015 to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's internationally recognised government, has carried out thousands of air attacks, killing thousands of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets, drawing international criticism.</p>
      <p>"In recent weeks, there have been entire 48-hour periods without air strikes for the first time since the conflict began," Griffiths said on Friday. "We call this de-escalation, a reduction in the tempo of the war, and perhaps a move towards an overall ceasefire in Yemen."</p>
      <p>De-escalation of hostilities is a major aspect of informal talks that have been going on between <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a> and Houthi officials since September for a possible ceasefire in Yemen.</p>
      <p>The talks began after the Houthis offered to halt cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities if the Riyadh-led coalition ended air strikes on Yemen.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's King Salman said that an agreement could lead to broader peace talks aimed at ending the conflict in Yemen.</p>
      <p>The UN diplomat added that skirmishes between the warring parties in the port city of Hodeidah, where the two sides agreed on a ceasefire last year, have been reduced by 80 percent after the deployment of UN monitors in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The Yemen war has killed more than 100,000 people and pushed millions to the brink of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/famine.html">famine</a>, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a non-governmental organisation.</p>
      <p>The nearly five-year-long war has created what the UN calls the world's largest humanitarian crisis. It says at least 12 million children are <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/12-million-children-suffering-yemen-war-191121142753810.html">caught up in the fighting</a> and need outside help.</p>
      <p>Griffiths said he hopes for a resolution to the conflict in the first few months of 2020.</p>
