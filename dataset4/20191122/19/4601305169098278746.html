      <p>And from the backstory by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/former-cia-officer-set-to-be-sentenced-in-chinese-spying-conspiracy/2019/11/21/4411eeaa-0aed-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">Washington Post reporter Rachel Weiner</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55, was trying to return to the CIA even as he was gathering information requested by Chinese spies and being paid more than $840,000 from unexplained sources. According to prosecutors, he eventually admitted getting at least 21 tasks from Chinese operatives, including requests to provide CIA names, methods and locations.<br/><br/>What he told the Chinese in response is still unclear. Lee insists that he never handed over the secrets he collected for his Chinese handlers, and prosecutors were unable to prove otherwise. But they say in a sentencing memorandum it is “all but certain” that some classified information was disclosed, although “we can never be sure of exactly how much.”</blockquote>
