      <p>Former NBA player Milt Palacio was falsely reported to have passed away following a rumor that he was hit by a car Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The false news story said that Palacio, 41, had been knocked down by a Honda Civic outside of a mall in Toronto, adding that he was taken to a local hospital where he eventually succumbed to his injuries. It was reported that “failed brakes” was the cause of the accident.</p>
      <p>The initial reports claimed that the U.S. Consulate in Canada had confirmed Palacio’s identity.</p>
      <p>However, Palacio – who is in his second season as the assistant coach of the Nets’ G-League affiliate – was reached by the Nets and confirmed to be okay. Palacio is with the G-League team in Canton.</p>
      <p>“These reports are inaccurate – we have spoken to Milt, and he is fine,” a public relations coordinator for the Nets told The Post.</p>
