      <h2>Brussels sprouts, cauliflowers and cabbages may have to be imported from abroad if the wet weather continues - as conditions are making it 'difficult' for harvesting some crops in the UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:30:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>Brussels sprouts could be off the Christmas lunch menu this year due to a shortage of the vegetable grown in the UK.</p>
      <p>Wet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> is being blamed as it's making the harvesting of crops 'very difficult' - and cauliflowers and cabbages are also being effected.</p>
      <p>The British Growers Association (BGA) told <a href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fruit-and-veg/wet-weather-means-uk-may-have-to-import-brassicas-warn-growers/599684.article">The Grocer</a> there is only a "short timescale" remaining for the weather to improve.</p>
      <p>If the wet weather continues and the vegetables, part of the brassica family, cannot be saved, they may have to be shipped in from overseas.</p>
      <p>Jack Ward, chief executive ofÂ BGA, said: "With the chances of things drying out being quite slim, the next step is starting to import [brassicas]."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10399604/brussels-sprout-shortage-christmas/?utm_campaign=sunmainfacebook&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1574434479">The Sun</a> , he said further rainfall could increase the risk of shortage but added that it was too early to determine the effects.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online recently reported that <a href="https://fave.co/33RSaOz">Asda</a> has launched Brussels sprouts flavoured crisps that come in the shape of the festive vegetable.</p>
      <p>The 150g bag of round maize snacks is priced at just 75p and is part of the supermarket giant's latest <a href="https://fave.co/2QiQUjL">Christmas food range</a> .</p>
