      <p>SCOTTSDALE, AZ — A police report just released details the death of Machelle Hobson, known as the “YouTube mom.”</p>
      <p>Hobson reportedly died of natural causes after she was found not breathing in her jail cell, according to a report released by the Scottsdale Police Department.</p>
      <p>The report says doctors believe Hobson suffered from cardiac arrest, had ongoing heart issues, and that no foul play was expected.</p>
      <p>Hobson was taken to the hospital after being found unresponsive in her jail cell and life saving efforts were initiated, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-northeast-valley/scottsdale/official-youtube-mom-machelle-hobson-dies-at-hospital-in-scottsdale">but she did not survive.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-central-southern-az/maricopa/maricopa-police-arrest-woman-for-abusing-seven-adopted-children">Hobson was facing 29 child abuse charges</a> involving seven of her adopted children, who investigators say she forced to perform in lucrative online videos.</p>
      <p>Hobson was potentially looking at life in prison if convicted.</p>
      <p>The Pinal County Attorney's Office says that while Hobson will not stand trial, the case is not completely over. Pinal County Attorney Kent Volkmer says Hobson's two adult sons could still face charges in the case for potentially knowing about the abuse and not reporting it.</p>
