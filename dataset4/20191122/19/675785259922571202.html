      <h1>Question Time: Jeremy Corbyn's surprising response to man blasting his 'reckless ideas'</h1>
      <h2>Labour's leader told the man 'I can’t understand everything that is going on in your mind' - but then offered to meet him and talk about it in a live TV moment in the 2019 general election leaders' special</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:29:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, Nicola Bartlett, Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn was faced with a barrage of angry questions tonight as he had a tough start to a grilling on the BBC's Question Time.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-jeremy-corbyn-reveals-hell-20939409">confirmed for the first time that he will stay personally neutral in a second Brexit referendum.</a></p>
      <p>But elsewhere he was bombarded with questions about his stance on anti-Semitism, the economy and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> in the opening minutes of his half-hour slot on a two-hour leaders' special.</p>
      <p>One audience member blasted his friendly response in 2016 to heckler Marc Wadsworth - who was later expelled from Labour - at a meeting where Ruth Smeeth walked out.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, his response to an audience member who attacked his plans for the economy was unexpected.</p>
      <p>The audience member thundered: "Your reckless socialist ideas are genuinely terrifying to me my family and friends."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "I can’t understand everything that is going on in your mind that makes you say that.</p>
      <p>"Maybe we can talk about it."</p>

      <p>It came as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> faced a live primetime grilling from voters as the clock ticks down to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn insisted companies “shouldn’t be frightened” of an incoming Labour government as he highlighted plans to lift corporation tax to 26%.</p>
      <p>He said: “The biggest businesses will be asked to pay a little bit more in corporation tax but will be lower than it was in 2010.”</p>
      <p>One audience member asked the Labour leader if he would campaign to stay in the EU or quit the bloc if he was Prime Minister and called another Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>There were groans when Mr Corbyn tried to explain his policy of “negotiating a credible Leave deal” before triggering a second EU referendum within six months, with an option to Remain.</p>
      <p>Faced by the audience’s reaction, he said: “Let me finish, please.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Stressing his plan was to bring people together, he added: “The issue of Brexit can be one that divides people enormously - it can and it does.”</p>
      <p>He was also quizzed about tackling climate change, and pressed his blueprint for a Green Industrial Revolution.</p>
      <p>But in a key development, Jeremy Corbyn confirmed he would stay neutral in a second Brexit referendum so he could fairly carry out the result.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader hopes to renegotiate a withdrawal deal before putting it to voters within six months of becoming Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>But he signalled he would refuse to take sides between backing his own pact or Remain in a campaign.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a live BBC Question Time leaders’ special, he said: “I will adopt a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the result.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere the Labour leader was challenged by an audience member over the treatment of Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.</p>
      <p>The man asked:  "I looked at a video on YouTube and particularly because I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <figcaption>The Labour leader was challenged by an audience member over the treatment of Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth (Image: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He said: "Ruth Smeeth a Jewish MP was heckled out of that press conferences and there you are, at the end of the press conference, chatting happily to that same heckler.</p>
      <p>He added: "I don't understand how you can say you stand for human rights and free speech with that's how you support that labour MP at a labour press conference."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately." The audience member interrupted saying: "Watch the video".</p>
      <p>"Nobody should suffer abuse and Ruth Smeeth and others have suffered the most unbelievable levels of  abuse, and it was a Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered because she stood up in public life.</p>
      <p>"I simply say to you that bad behaviour, misogynism, racism in any form is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party, or in our society."</p>
      <p>The audience member asked again: "Why were you talking happily to that same heckler" and "why would Labour female MPs need protection at Labour Party conference?"</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>"Maybe we can talk about it" (Image: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "I've had many conversations with Ruth Smeeth since then," adding: "You don't know what was said between us."</p>
      <p>Asked how he felt about the party being investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, he replied: "It's our process that is being looked at," saying that he welcomed it and the party had "placed ourselves completely open".</p>
      <p>He added that Labour had established the ECHR and promised to "fund it properly" in government.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader were each due to be quizzed for 30 minutes by a BBC1 Question Time studio audience in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem chief Jo Swinson and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> ’s Nicola Sturgeon were also confronted with voters’ questions, hosted by BBC presenter Fiona Bruce.</p>
      <p>The leaders will drew lots to decide the appearance order.</p>
      <p>The format has proved tricky for No10 hopefuls in the past; in 2015 Ed Miliband stumbled off the stage after fielding questions for half an hour.</p>
      <p>And in 2017 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> was wounded after shouting at a nurse: “There is no magic money tree!”</p>
      <p>The TV showdown comes after Labour launched its manifesto, and on the eve of the Conservatives’ unveiling their ballot box blueprint.</p>
