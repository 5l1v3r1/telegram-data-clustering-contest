      <h1>Zamboanga to leave lasting impression in ONE debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:03:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Manila Standard Sports</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/denice-zamboanga/">Denice “The Menace Fairtex” Zamboanga</a> from the Philippines will look for a debut to remember when she takes the stage in the <a href="http://onefc.com/">world’s largest martial arts organization.</a> Zamboanga battles the exciting <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/jihin-radzuan/">Jihin “Shadow Cat” Radzuan</a> in a three-round atomweight affair at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/mark-of-greatness/">ONE: MARK OF GREATNESS</a></p>
      <p> at the Axiata Arena in Kuala, Lumpur, Malaysia on 6 December.</p>
      <p>Carrying an immaculate record of 5-0, Zamboanga is out to prove that she can carry her previous success into the ONE Circle, and with less than three weeks to go before her much-awaited debut, the Filipina standout could not be more excited. </p>
      <p> “[I am] really grateful to be part of the best organization in the world. I’m very excited to represent my own country. This is a big opportunity for me, fighting against a top contender in my division especially [in] my debut fight,” Zamboanga said.</p>
      <p>“I'm working very hard for this fight. I want to start my ONE Championship journey with a win.”</p>
      <p>Coming from a family of martial artists, Zamboanga promises to bring that pedigree to ONE Championship, and after stopping three of her first five foes, the excitement for her debut is certainly warranted. </p>
      <p>But she knows it will not be an easy transition to ONE, particularly with the level of athletes competing in the organization. </p>
      <p>“I'm focusing on my striking and wrestling because I know [Jihin] is really good at striking,” Zamboanga said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been working triple-time during training sessions and I am more confident in my game.”</p>
      <p>The woman standing in her path will not be an easy conquest though, with Jihin being a former Wushu World Champion and MIMMA Women’s Champion. </p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Johor Bahru City native is also regarded by many as the future of women’s martial arts in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“She's well rounded so I need to be careful with her striking and ground game as well. I don't see any weaknesses from her – except for her wrestling. I guess my wrestling is better than her,” Zamboanga said.</p>
      <p>“I know she’s a strong fighter and she’s also hungry to end [the year] with a win but I will do everything so I can keep up with whatever she’ll throw in our fight.” </p>
      <p>While wary of Radzuan’s skill, “The Menace Fairtex” remains confident that she can take on the hometown hero and leave a lasting impression. </p>
      <p>“I don’t have any plans of wasting this magnificent opportunity ONE Championship has given me,” Zamboanga said.</p>
      <p>This match is for everyone who believes in me. I dedicate this to God, family, friends, and supporters.”</p>
      <p>ONE Championship returns to the Lion City for one last time this year with <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/edge-of-greatness/">ONE: EDGE OF GREATNESS</a></p>
      <p> this Friday, 22 November at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. </p>
      <p>Action starts at 7 p.m. on the <a href="https://www.onefc.com/download-app/">ONE Super App.</a></p>
      <p> The main card starts at 8:30pm on ABS-CBN S+A.</p>
