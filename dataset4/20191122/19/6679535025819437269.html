      <h1>Onion to be sold for ₹25 a kg at rythu bazaars from today</h1>
      <h2>Minister warns of action against those selling it for a higher price</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:58:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sumit-Bhattacharjee-621/" target="_blank">Sumit Bhattacharjee</a></address>
      <p>One kg of onion will be available for ₹25 at all the rythu bazaars in the State from Saturday, Minister of Animal Husbandry, Fisheries &amp; Marketing Mopidevi Venkataramana Rao has said.</p>
      <p>“Due to shortage of onion, the quantity that an individual can purchase has been restricted to half-a-kg. But as things are improving, thanks to the measures being taken by the government, the quantity that can be purchased has been increased to 1 kg,” Mr. Rao told the media here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Onion price has been going through the roof for the last few months. At present, the price of 1 kg of onion in the open market is anywhere between ₹60 and ₹80.</p>
      <p>“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has instructed that 150 tonnes of onion should be made available across the 85 rythu bazaars on a daily basis,” the Minister said.</p>
      <p>“Till Thursday, we have distributed 470 tonnes. From now on, we have made arrangements to make available 150 tonnes per day and the price has been fixed at ₹25 per kg,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If anyone finds that onion is being sold at a price higher than one fixed at the ryhtu bazaars, they can lodge a complaint and action will be initiated immediately,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Vegetable prices</h3>
      <p>Accepting that vegetable prices too were skyrocketing, he said, “Efforts are on to bring them under control, and farmers will be compensated through the market intervention fund.”</p>
      <p>The government was also working out a plan to eliminate the middleman system, he said.</p>
