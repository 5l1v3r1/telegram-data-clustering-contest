      <h1>Alberta MLAs reject bill for health workers who refuse service based on moral beliefs</h1>
      <h2>Bill would have meant workers could not be sued for refusing to provide services like abortions</h2>

      <p>A private member’s bill that would have given further protection to Alberta health workers who invoked their conscience rights has been rejected at the committee level.</p>
      <p>The standing committee on private members’ bills heard from four doctors, the Trans Equality Society of Alberta and Dying with Dignity Canada before voting against the proposal.</p>
      <p>The bill was brought forward by United Conservative government backbencher Dan William.</p>
      <p>It would have meant that health-care providers could not be sued or sanctioned for refusing to provide services — such as abortion, assisted dying or contraception — that went against their moral beliefs.</p>
      <p>Currently, Alberta doctors who don’t want to perform those services must refer patients to someone who will.</p>
      <p>Concerns had been raised by the Opposition NDP that the bill could have created a back-door way to restrict access to abortion and contraception, particularly in rural areas where access to physicians and services can be limited.</p>
      <p>A doctor and a transgender rights advocate raised similar concerns before the committee Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Conscience rights are used by anti-abortion groups, specifically and openly, as a way to reopen this debate,” said Dr. Jillian Ratti.</p>
      <p>Holly Tomm, president of the Trans Equality Society of Alberta, added the bill would further decrease health-care access for members of the LGBTQ community.</p>
      <p>“If we reach out to those agencies and we get a stone wall — no other referrals, no other information — we crawl back into our closets and we start harming ourselves,” said Tomm.</p>
      <p>There was support for the bill.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kiely Williams suggested rural physicians could leave or quit if their beliefs were not protected.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t allow the freedoms for people to object, my point is that we will lose it for everyone,” she said.</p>
      <p>Janis Irwin, the NDP’s critic for women and LGBTQ issues, called the 8-2 vote against the bill a victory.</p>
