      <h1>Marchisio: The best player in the history of football is Andres Iniesta</h1>
      <h2>The Italian revealed his admiration for the former Barcelona midfielder</h2>

      <p>Ex-Italy international Claudio Marchisio considers former Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta the best to ever play the game.</p>
      <p>Marchisio, who recently retired from football, was full of praise for Iniesta: "How did Iniesta not win a Ballon d'Or? I don't understand it. He has three brains, one in his right foot, one in his left foot and another in his head.</p>
      <p>"Barcelona have Lionel Messi, but for me the best player in history is Andres Iniesta."</p>
      <p>It's worth pointing out that Messi won the Ballon d'Or in 2010, the year that Spain won the World Cup, when many thought it would be Iniesta.</p>
      <p>Marchisio continued: "It's impressive how easy he can play the game. He was Barcelona's lethal weapon."</p>
      <p>The former Juventus midfielder faced Iniesta on various occasions for club and country and is running out of adjectives to describe him.</p>
