      <h1>Razorpay Debuts Credit, Banking Services For Underbanked Businesses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:21:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Razorpay, a large payments processing outfit in India, has introduced an array of new services to provide startups, businesses and gig workers in the country with credit and banking services, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/razorpay-credit-card-current-account-neo-bank/">according to a report</a>.</p>
      <p>The Bangalore-based startup, which raised about $75 million in funding from Ribbit Capital and others earlier this year, aims to continue its expansion and to offer services for businesses that are not served by traditional banks. <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2019/razorpay-hires-mastercard-exec-in-bid-to-work-with-rbi-on-payment-regs/">Razorpay</a> launched a corporate credit card along with banking services and a new payment option to allow businesses to quickly receive money from clients.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/economy/2019/india-alt-lending-struggling-economy/">India</a>, many startups struggle to get financial services and bank loans, and many cannot get a corporate credit card.</p>
      <p>Razorpay has developed a system to identify eligible donors, according to Founders Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar. The cards, which are issued by RBL Bank, offer credit lines between $700 and $34,800. Companies can avoid interest fees if the loan is paid back within 50 days.</p>
      <p>The company is also introducing a current accounts initiative.</p>
      <p>“While [the] personal banking ecosystem in India has scaled tremendously in recent years, business banking is still old-school,” Mathur said. “Most processes are still manual, and there is no communication among your invoice, payroll [and] booking systems. People have to deal with spreadsheet files.”</p>
      <p>To alleviate this issue, the company has introduced a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/tag/neobank/">neobanking</a> platform.</p>
      <p>“As a business, if you want to create a current account with a bank, we take care of it. Everything – your transactions and payables – happens on Razorpay’s platform, and you can manage them through a single dashboard,” Mathur said.</p>
      <p>Razorpay also offers a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/tag/payroll-management/">payroll management</a> service.</p>
      <p>“One of the most common challenges in a business is how they handle payrolls. Most of these payrolls work with different systems, such as HR and accounting. Again, you have to create spreadsheet files and provide [them] to the bank, which does the processing. [Our] goal is that we will provide one single platform to manage payments better,” Mathur said.</p>
      <p>Finally, the company has introduced a payment option for unregistered businesses in the country. Companies can send a link that can be accessed through text or email to get a payment in real time.</p>
      <p>“We support 100 currencies, so a person can have their money delivered from any country,” Mathur noted.</p>
