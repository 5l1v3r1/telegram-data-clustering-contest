      <h1>Wexit Sask. likely to focus on few constituencies in 2020 election: organizer</h1>

      <p>The separatist political movement is collecting the 2,500 signatures required to register as a political party with Elections Saskatchewan.</p>

      <h3>A Saskatchewan secessionist movement is signalling its intention to concentrate its resources on one, or possibly a few, constituencies before next fall’s provincial election.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/wexit-party-registration-drive-coming-to-saskatchewan">While registering as a political party and fielding candidates is Wexit Saskatchewan’s “Plan B,”</a> Premier Scott Moe’s apparent refusal to entertain its demand for a referendum on separation suggests that is the likely course.</p>
      <p>A credible right-wing party could hurt the governing Saskatchewan Party by splitting the vote, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-party-not-sounding-alarm-about-wexit-electoral-threat">but insiders on both sides of the aisle say they have not seen anything to suggest Wexit Saskatchewan could be an electoral force next year.</a></p>
      <p>That is largely because building a political party from scratch takes time and money, though sources agreed the emergence of a popular and well-financed separatist party leader could change the landscape.</p>
      <p>Wexit Saskatchewan organizer Eric Wall acknowledged no such person has come forward and 11 months is a short time in which to establish a political party.</p>
      <p>However, even electing a single MLA “would show massive progress for this movement, guarantee it,” Wall said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying I’m the leader of this party, just to make that clear, but if I was I’m not interested in running candidates that are weak candidates … I mean, if we have one strong candidate, all resources are going to go toward one strong candidate.”</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that constituencies in which a Wexiteer would likely gain the most support are rural ridings where Sask. Party candidates have won by large margins, potentially minimizing the effect of a split vote.</p>
      <p>While Wexit Saskatchewan still hopes Moe calls a referendum, the movement’s small group of organizers in the province is collecting the 2,500 voters’ signatures required to register as a political party.</p>
      <p>Elections Saskatchewan said this week it had not yet received a party application from Wexit Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Asked about potential support for the movement, Wall pointed to Wexit Saskatchewan’s visible presence on social media and widespread anger with the federal Liberals.</p>
      <p>“I can see that the next four years of this Trudeau government are not going to be easy for the western people,” he said, adding that the movement is founded, in part, on an expectation of continued Liberal electoral victories.</p>
      <p>The Sask. Party’s political strategy is understood to involve giving voice to western frustrations without fanning the flames of separation, while working to keep its “big tent” of centrist and right-wing voters as big as possible.</p>
      <p>“We have received correspondence from many individuals regarding Western frustration, and have been clear that the premier’s focus is on a new deal with Canada,” said Moe’s press secretary, Jim Billington.</p>
      <p>Wall said the movement is also looking beyond the next provincial election.</p>
      <p>“What we’re talking about right now is today. But what I see is a very bright future for Wexit.”</p>
