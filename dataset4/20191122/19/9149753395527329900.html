      <h1>AMD trots out an overclockable Athlon processor with Vega graphics for $49</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:27:06+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>We have plenty of recommendations if you're on the hunt for the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-for-gaming/">best CPU for gaming</a>, and generally speaking you'll want to spend more than $49 even on a budget. But what if you're on a extremely tight budget? Well, AMD's new <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-athlon-3000g">Athlon 3000G</a> might be an option.</p>
      <p>At that price, the Athlon 3000G falls squarely into entry-level territory. Normally we wouldn't expect much at that price. However, one thing that makes this new chip intriguing is it has an unlocked multiplier to making overclocking easier.</p>
      <p>AMD is very much pitching that angle, with the usual caveat of the warranty going out the window. And rightfully so—that's a definite selling point for a $49 CPU.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is not a beefy chip by any stretch. It's a dual-core processor with SMT support (so 2 cores and 4 threads), with a 3.5GHz base clock, 4MB of L3 cache, and a 35W TDP. It also features Vega 3 graphics, clocked at 1100MHz.</p>
      <p>Like the Athlon 200GE, the Athlon 3000G is based AMD's first-generation 14nm Zen CPU architecture. However, the the CPU frequency is 300MHz higher, and the Vega 3 graphics is clocked 100MHz higher.</p>
      <p>The unlocked multiplier is the other differentiating factor, and perhaps the biggest one—the Athlon 3000G is the first Zen-based Athlon product to have one. How far it can actual overclock will depend on a variety of factors. That said, <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-athlon-3000g-with-vega-3-graphics/">TechPowerUp</a> managed to push an all-core x40 multiplier, yielding a 4GHz clockspeed (for a 500MHz overclock).</p>
      <p>I'm not seeing the Athlon 3000G on any online retail shelves just yet, but I imagine will be available soon. It could be a good option for a cheap PC, though with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> arriving soon, I wouldn't jump gun just yet.</p>
