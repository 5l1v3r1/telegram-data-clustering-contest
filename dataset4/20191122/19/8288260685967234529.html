      <h2>Aston Villa: End of the Decade | Jack Grealish is on the cusp of Premier League greatness already as his scintillating form in claret and blue continues at a relentless pace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Icon: a very famous person or thing considered as representing a set of beliefs or a way of life.</p>
      <p>That's the Cambridge Dictionary meaning and, in terms of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>, it encompasses a certain - and super - Jack Grealish.</p>
      <p>After recently turning 24, the skipper is now in the form of his life and looks nailed-on for his first-ever senior England call-up next time out.</p>
      <p>Up for the most-recent Premier League player of the month gong, Grealish continues to ooze class and has done ever since making his first-team bow aged 19 with that No.40 on his back at Manchester City on May 7, 2014.</p>
      <p>The rise of Super Jack has been startling; from skinny boy walking around Sutton Coldfield after training to the floppy-haired whizz-kid waltzing past fully-grown blokes for Notts County, to giving Steven Gerrard the run-around at Wembley while, last term, dragging his beloved Aston Villa back into the big-time.</p>

      <p>This season is Grealish's seventh as a professional and it'll turn out to be his best yet. Here, we take a look at Jack Grealish's rise over the past decade - and look at just how important he could be for club and country going into the next.</p>
      <p>It was Saturday, September 14, 2013 when bright-eyed Grealish, then 18, hopped onto a coach-load of strangers before being given his first taste of the men's game thanks to boss Chris Kiwomya: the last half-hour as Notts County trailed MK Dons 2-0 before going on to lose 3-1.</p>
      <p>Grealish made such an impression on Kiwomya that he'd start the next game before keeping his place for the remainder of the campaign as new gaffer, Shaun Derry, went all-out to extend his loan deal in January.</p>
      <p>Raving about Grealish, Derry said: "I was fortunate enough to inherit Jack as a player for Notts County when I got the management job there. I’d probably say that without him there, Notts County would have got relegated.</p>

      <p>"He was absolutely phenomenal for us, even as a kid. He’s learnt, and he’s made his mistakes, and he’s been courted by these big clubs, and he has stayed loyal to Aston Villa. Can he play for a top-six club? Absolutely."</p>
      <p>A total of 39 appearances - and five goals - for County sufficed in Grealish's breakthrough season, helping the Nottingham outfit to League One survival.</p>
      <p>Four days later, then-Villa boss Paul Lambert chucked him on for Ryan Bertrand at the Etihad with two minutes to go as Villa crashed to a 4-0 defeat. A big summer followed and Lambert looked to ease him in after giving Grealish his first Villa Park start for the 1-0 loss against Leyton Orient in the Captial One Cup.</p>
      <p>Tim Sherwood arrived in the February and, a month later, substitute Grealish was sent off in the dying moments of the FA Cup quarter-final win over rivals West Brom.</p>

      <p>A month afterwards Grealish made his first Premier League start as Villa drew 3-3 with QPR before starting again at Tottenham and once more at Wembley, putting in a dazzling display to help Villa see off Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. He'd go onto light it up again at Manchester City a week later before starting every game playing off Christian Benteke right up until that devastating 4-0 defeat to Arsenal in the final.</p>
      <p>"When some kids come and play with the first-team sometimes, they’re a bit overawed, but Jack’s not," Sherwood said of Grealish's breakthrough. "He receives the ball and dribbles it around people. They kick lumps out of him because he’s so confident.</p>
      <p>"The ball is his friend, it sticks to his foot. The more opportunities he gets, the better he’s going to become."</p>
      <p>Grealish's first goal in claret and blue came at Leicester - and what a finish it was - before racing away to the man who kept on backing him, Sherwood. The pair embraced but Villa let their two-goal lead slip before losing 3-2 in what was the beginning of the end for Sherwood at Villa.</p>
      <p>The managerial change was made on the eve of the Tottenham defeat - the seventh on the spin - on November 2 as Remi Garde arrived to see if he could arrest the club's alarming - and rapid - slide towards inevitable relegation.</p>

      <h3>Does Jack Grealish deserve an England call up?</h3>
      <h4>3000+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Yes- straight away Not yet- but he will soon No</p>
      <p>Garde dropped Grealish for the 0-0 draw at home to Manchester City before recalling him after the international break for the match with Everton at Goodison Park. Garde's rock-bottom Villa were hammered 4-0 and Grealish, then 20, was soon banished to to the youth team after being seen partying in a Manchester nightclub just hours after the heavy Everton defeat.</p>
      <p>The latest incident came a little over a year after Grealish was sprawled out unconscious while on holiday in Tenerife - and Garde ordered for more discipline.</p>
      <p>"(His actions) are not of the professional (standard) that I expect from my players," Garde announced, declaring Grealish would be dropped from the squad. "That’s why Jack is training in under-21 team.</p>
      <p>"He’s not playing at the weekend and at this stage, I think that’s enough. Jack has got a lot of ability but he needs to improve his game and work at it. That’s not because he is 20, it is because when you are a footballer of any age you have to work hard and be ready."</p>

      <p>Grealish wouldn't start another game until Sunderland on January 2, some seven games after the ill-famed incident, and wasn't named in the starting XI at all until the following season as Aston Villa were relegated with just 17 points in what was an all-time low for the B6 club.</p>
      <p>So it was the Championship for Jack - who'd signed a new four-year deal - at this point and the play-maker grabbed a brilliant solo goal - his second for the club - against Rotherham amid Villa's stuttering start under Roberto Di Matteo. Another brilliant goal followed a fortnight later at Bristol City before the club called on an internal investigation following reports of an all-night party after a goalless draw at Ipswich.</p>
      <p>Speaking on September 22. Di Matteo said: "He needs to grow up very quickly. It’s not the first time and he needs to understand if he wants a good career he has to stop.</p>
      <p>He added: "First it’s a feeling of disappointment. I expect all players to behave in a professional manner at all times. We instantly started an investigation which is still ongoing. Once it’s finished and we have all the facts then we will take disciplinary action. This is the stance."</p>

      <p>Grealish was dropped for the Newcastle game before returning to the XI for the 1-1 draw at Barnsley. Things were somewhat of a disaster, though. Villa were 19th and had won just one of their opening 11 games before Di Matteo was sacked and replaced by Steve Bruce. Grealish would total 33 appearances that campaign, scoring five goals while picking up a bit of a reputation for being a hot-head (six yellow cards, one red). As for Villa, they finished 13th in the Championship with Grealish only showing the odd flutter of form, including a stupendous strike at Craven Cottage.</p>
      <p>The following season, though, it was time to step up, no messing, as Grealish, newly-signed John Terry and Bruce went about securing promotion once and for all. As for Jack, he'd missed the first 15 games due to a severe kidney injury picked up during a clash with former teammate Tom Cleverley while playing in a friendly with Watford at Villa Park a week before the season.</p>
      <p>"I took a kick to the kidney and it split in two places," he said. "It was pouring with blood, internally, for about five hours. It’s the worst pain I’ve ever been in.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"I went to Heartlands hospital in Birmingham. They found out what it was and I was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth for an operation. Before it happened, the surgeon had to tell me the consequences of what could happen if it didn’t work. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘Jack, you could die’. My reply was, ‘What?’ I was genuinely scared. I was expecting to be back inside a week, but it was three or four months."</p>
      <p>Villa were sixth up until Jack's return in November with Grealish eased back into the XI by Bruce until a 2-0 defeat to Derby on December 16, 2017, the Solihull star's first start of the campaign. Grealish would go onto score just the three goals but helped get Villa into the play-off final where they'd agonisingly lose to Fulham 1-0. After the final whistle at Wembley, Grealish crumpled to the turf knowing it was over. Tottenham soon stepped up their pursuit and Grealish began saying his goodbyes - only for Spurs' reluctance at paying anywhere near Villa's £40m asking price.</p>
      <p>The proposed transfer would roll on into the 2018/19 season as Grealish kissed and waved goodbye to the away fans at Hull. "It’s fair to say we were in such a bad position financially that if Tottenham had have done their work early, then I’m sure he would have been a Tottenham player,” Steve Bruce said. "Before the takeover came in, everyone was for sale – that’s how difficult the situation was."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While Grealish himself admitted afterwards: "At Hull, I was 95 per cent sure it was going to be my last game. I waved to the fans when I got taken off as I thought I was going.</p>
      <p>"Even on the Thursday morning of the transfer window, I thought I was leaving. Before the new owners [arrived], Villa needed the money so I kind of accepted that me going would save the club. I think the fans would have taken that, too, because we needed the money.</p>
      <p>"It was unsettling, it was all summer. A lot of people saw the interview with the manager in Portugal when he said the club would have to sell me. At that time it could have got done, but for whatever reason it didn’t. [Spurs] weren’t willing to pay what Villa wanted at the time. But the new owners came in and they changed everything.</p>
      <p>"It’s not like I was devastated it didn’t happen, though, because I’ve still got to realise how lucky I am to be playing for my boyhood club. I’ve played over 100 games for Villa and I’ve only just turned 23."</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Just a year after signing a four-year deal, Grealish signed an improved five-year one last September, as chief executive Christian Purslow said: "Securing the long-term future of Jack, a player we believe will play a pivotal role in leading Aston Villa back to where it belongs, is fantastic news for everybody associated with our football club.</p>
      <p>"He is a tremendous talent who has been with us since he was a child and naturally we are delighted that he has now committed the next five years of his career to Aston Villa."</p>
      <p>And he wasn't wrong. Life-long Villan and one-time Holte End steps sweeper Dean Smith arrived in the October to replace Bruce, with Grealish's form picking up considerably from that very moment. The Villa star would bag his biggest-ever goals tally of six while showing the entire country his awe-inspiring ability with the football between his feet. Grealish scored - and almost cried with happiness - against Blues before a nasty shin injury ruled him out until the March.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16261402.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Grealish.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>At this point, Villa captain James Chester was out and Smith's masterstroke was to give the Holte End hero the armband. A goal on his return at Derby followed before Villa, led by Grealish, would go on to win 10 games on the spin - a new club record - as promotion was sweetly sealed. In between that, though, was the smack he got off shamed Bluenose Paul Mitchell before going onto score the winner at St Andrews. He'd also shown his class with a stunning solo goal at Rotherham.</p>
      <p>But, moments after beating Derby at Wembley, Grealish said: "It's the best day of my life. I've just seen my family, it was all a bit emotional there. At the start of the season I didn't even think I'd be here. I'm here now with my little baby (trophy) having captained this club back to where it belongs, honestly it's a dream come true."</p>
      <p>And the dream goes on for Grealish in the Premier League as his scintillating form continues. The skipper is "working like a Trojan" according to his dad, Kevin, and the rewards are being reaped. He has four goals from his 12 appearances in all competitions at the time of writing, looks deadlier than ever playing in a new inside forward role, while Gareth Southgate surely must take notice of him soon ahead of Euro 2020, a big tournament which will remain a huge carrot for the Villa star throughout the season.</p>

        <figcaption>(Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I've waxed lyrical about him a lot," Smith beamed. "He's just been nominated for player of the month which tells you everything about him the last month."</p>
      <p>And it sure does tell you everything, for Grealish has firmly asserted himself as the claret and blue icon he most definitely is, a player and person who represents everything that's right about this new-look Aston Villa side: prepared, together and fearless - the three words chosen by Grealish and his teammates as the club's values for the months and years ahead.</p>
      <p>Of course, we love him - he's Villa through and through. He's living the dream we all had and still have. But it doesn't take biased, claret and blue tinted specs to realise this lad is a special talent.</p>
      <p>As for the next 10 years, well, the world's Grealish's oyster. He's on the cusp of Premier League greatness already with his prime years well and truly ahead of him - and that makes for a scary proposition. One thing is for sure, this AVFC icon will go about building his own legacy and Villa - and its fans - will be the benefactor.</p>
