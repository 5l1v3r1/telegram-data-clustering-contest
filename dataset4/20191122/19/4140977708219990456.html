          <p>As it turns out the 42<sup>nd</sup> match of Women’s Big Bash League will be a much anticipated one especially given the fact that both Sydney Sixers and Perth Scorchers are at the first half of the points table.</p>
          <p>However, the current form for both the teams has been contrasting. While Sydney Sixers has been on the decline after losing a couple of matches on the trot, Perth Scorchers has been in good form after crushing Melbourne Stars in their previous clash. Sydney Sixers has been under immense pressure especially after the injury sustained to regular skipper Elyse Perry. She will be out for at least a couple of weeks.</p>

                <h3>Match Conditions and Toss</h3>
                <p>The Lilac Hill Park in Perth will host its first match of the tournament. Nothing much is known about the surface but given the tradition of Perth, the surface is expected to assist the seam bowlers at the start of the innings. However given the fact that it is a T20 wicket, we should be expecting a competitive score on the board for the team batting first. The team winning the toss might be tempted to field as the pitch will host the first match of the tournament.</p>

                            <p>Ellyse Perry, Erin Burns</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs SS-W Dream 11 Wicket-keeper</h3>
                            <p><b>Alyssa Healy</b> has been a prolific run-scorer and a sound option when it comes to wicket-keeping. She has looked in good touch in the tournament and is a very important pick in any Dream 11 team. Meanwhile, she will also be leading the Sixers in the absence of regular skipper Ellyse Perry.</p>
                            <p><b>Ammy Elen Jones</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> pick in this segment especially due to her good form in the tournament. In the previous clash against Melbourne Stars she scored a brisk 70 and played a pivotal role in Perth Scorchers decimating Melbourne Stars by 9 wickets.</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs SS-W Dream 11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p><b>Meg Lanning</b> will our first pick in this segment. She doesn’t need any introduction when it comes to women’s cricket. Over the years she has been a prolific run-scorer for Australia. Even in the previous clash against Melbourne Stars, she scored a brilliant 68 and shared a match-winning stand with Ammy Elen Jones.</p>
                            <p><b>Ashleigh Gardner</b> will be the next pick in this segment. She has been a prolific run-scorer for Australia and tends to lead from the front. Gardner has looked in great touch and in the absence of Elyse Perry, Gardner’s presence will prove to be vital.</p>
                            <p><b>Erin Burns</b> will be the next pick as she has also been one such cricketer who has looked in good form in the tournament. She will look to continue her good work. <b>Maddy Dark</b> will be the last player in this segment.</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs SS-W Dream 11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p><b>Natalie Sciver</b> has been in good all-round form and hence she is our first pick in this segment. She has chipped in with useful knocks including a half-century against Melbourne Renegades. She has also been among the wickets on most occasions.</p>
                            <p><b>Heather Graham</b> will be our 2nd pick in this segment. Graham bowled brilliantly in the previous clash and has looked in form.</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs SS-W Dream 11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p><b>Marizzane Kapp</b> will be our first bowler in this segment. She was at her best in the previous clash despite her team losing out to Hobart Hurricanes. Kapp scored 55 in the previous clash and also bagged 3 wickets.</p>
                            <p><b>Samantha Betts</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> bowler in this segment. She was the wrecker in chief with the ball for Perth Scorchers in the previous clash bagging 3 wickets. She will look to carry on from where she left the other day.</p>
                            <p><b>Stella Campbel</b>l will be our last pick. She has bowled well and conceded just 10 runs for a wicket in the previous clash.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Our captain of the day will be Meg Lanning while the vice-captain will be Allyssa Healy.</p>
