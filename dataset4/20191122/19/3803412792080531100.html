      <h4>Where to find it on your TV</h4>
      <p>Almost any smart TV is likely to have a Disney+ app. Whether it's a TV with Roku built-in, your Samsung smart TV, or your Web OS LG TV, it's likely to be one of the first things you see when you turn on the TV. Installing it depends on the TV model, but you should be able to navigate to the Disney+ logo and click install.</p>
      <h4>Casting to your Chromecast</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Both the iOS app and the Android app will let you cast to a Chromecast. In case you don't know, a Chromecast is a small dongle that allows you stream services to your TV, and it's controlled through your phone. It's a simple way to get quality content, and it's cheap. You can pick up the latest Chromecast — the Chromecast Ultra — at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA3A00403A14-Chromecast-Ultra/dp/B0157OY5EA/?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU59783YYw">just $70.</a> The Chromecast Ultra will also stream those excellent Disney+ shows in 4K so you can watch the Mandalorian the way it was meant to be seen.</p>
      <p>To watch Disney+ through your Chromecast, make sure your phone and your Chromecast are on the same Wi-Fi network. When you load the app, you should see the cast button in the top right — it looks like a square with a Wi-Fi symbol in the bottom corner — if you tap that icon, you will see it animate as it connects. Once it's connected, a Disney+ splash screen will appear on your TV, waiting for you to choose a show.</p>
      <h3>Progressive Web App</h3>
      <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are incredibly helpful when a company doesn't make an app for Windows 10. Strangely, Disney didn't make an app for Windows even though they already have one for Xbox, especially as the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/disney-needs-release-its-app-windows10">Xbox app kind of works on Windows 10.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-disney-app-windows-10">Making a PWA for Windows 10</a>, will create a self-contained instance of Disney+ that you can pin to your taskbar and access anytime you need.</p>
      <h4>So many options</h4>
      <p>Disney has made a concerted effort to make sure you can use Disney+ on almost anything with a screen — except for your Echo Show, unfortunately — so however you want to watch, there is likely an app for it. I'm partial to the Chromecast myself; it's simple and streams in 4K so I can get the most out of the shows I watch.</p>
      <p>We'd love to know if you have found any other ways to watch Disney+. Maybe you sideloaded it on to your Samsung fridge? Or got it playing on your watch? Let us know in the comments, and we will update the article.</p>
