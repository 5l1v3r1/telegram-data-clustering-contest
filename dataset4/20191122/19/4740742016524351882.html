      <h1>Charity to launch card scheme for Gloucester Road that helps people offset carbon footprint by buying local woodland</h1>
      <h2>Every £2.50 donated is a square metre of land</h2>

      <p>A gift card scheme coming to Gloucester Road will allow customers to buy square metres of local woodland as a way of off-setting their carbon footprint.</p>
      <p>Bristol-based charity Avon Needs Trees and Alchemy bar owner, Sarah Thorp have developed a gift card system for people to help tackle climate change in and around the city.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can buy as many square metres as they like from selected stores on the high street to either send as gifts cards or a way to offset against the purchases they make.</p>

      <p>Nikki Jones, Chair of the organisation said: “Avon Needs Trees is buying land in the Bristol-Avon catchment area to create new, permanent forest.</p>
      <p>She says the need for more woodland will help carbon sequestration, local biodiversity improvement, natural flood management and public amenity space in Bristol and surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>Ms Thorp said: “It's impossible to be carbon neutral and our customers have the same problem therefore, I came up with a plan to help with reforestation and the other objectives of Avon Needs Trees.”</p>
      <p>She says it was not until she recognised the part she played as a business owner, that she felt encouraged to find better ways to make a living which also benefited the planet.</p>

      <p>“It seems obvious that as a shopkeeper my main aim is to sell things; however, I'm finding this is going against my principles these days now that we have reached a Climate Emergency,” she added.</p>
      <p>The charity is soon able to make its first purchase of land between Chippenham and Calne after raising £200,000 from public responses.</p>
      <p>Miss Jones said: “The aim is to have a significant impact on the local area over the next 10 - 20 years and for every £2.50 donated, we get another square metre closer.”</p>

      <p>“Better that we gift each other something for a healthy planet than something that will end up as landfill,” said Ms Thorp.</p>
      <p>The vouchers can be found At the Alchemy bar, Room 212 and during the North Bristol Art Trail from November 23.</p>
