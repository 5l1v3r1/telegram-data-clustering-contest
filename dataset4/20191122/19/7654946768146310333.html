      <h1>New Jersey is the ‘smartest’ state in America – yes, really</h1>

      <p>The Garden State is full of bookworms!</p>
      <p>New Jersey is the “smartest” state in the US — beating out New York and other areas supposedly packed with high-achieving brainiacs, according to a <a href="https://www.safehome.org/smartest-americans/">new study</a> that centers on Census data.</p>
      <p>The Big Apple’s underrated neighbor ranked the No. 1 most intelligent, based on a formula that considers the percentage of adults with college degrees and high school diplomas, along with the highest median SAT scores.</p>
      <p>Roughly 24 percent of New Jersey residents have a bachelor’s degree and 91 percent are high school grads — far more than the Empire State as a whole, according to the study by Safehome.org, which researches home and personal safety.</p>
      <p>It shows the state’s median SAT score last year was 1,090, and that 64 percent of ACT takers “met benchmarks.”</p>
      <p>By contrast, New York ranked near the bottom of the smartest states list at No. 32.</p>
      <p>The report offered no reason for why the land best known for less-than-academic types like Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino and Tony Soprano is teeming with smarties.</p>
      <p>Utah was second-brightest and Massachusetts came in third. Idaho residents are the dumbest, according to the study, which also analyzed US Department of Education data and test scores from the College Board.</p>
      <p>The ranking formula “weighted educational attainment [more] than test scores” and assigned the most value to college degrees.</p>
      <p>Overall, the Northeast region of the country ranked brighter than the West Coast.</p>
