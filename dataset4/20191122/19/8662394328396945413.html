      <p>More than 300 officers and sailors from one of Australia's largest warships, HMAS Canberra, are set to march through their namesake city with swords drawn, colours flying and drums beating.</p>
      <p>The march will travel from Akuna Street, along Bunda Street, on Northbourne Avenue and onto London Circuit, where ACT chief police officer Ray Johnson will ceremonially challenge commanding officer Captain Terry Morrison, before granting the ship's company freedom of entry to the city.</p>
      <p>After the challenge, the parade will continue along London Circuit before turning left into Akuna Street, where it will conclude.</p>
      <p>ACT Policing said in a statement the march would begin at 11am, with some periodic road closures in place in Civic between 9am and 12pm to accommodate the march.</p>
