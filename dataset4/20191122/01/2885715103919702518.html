      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:59:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sagar-rajput/" target="_blank">Sagar Rajput</a></address>
      <p>A 40-year-old chemical engineer has been arrested for allegedly stalking, defaming, harassing and creating fake social media accounts of a make-up artiste based in South Mumbai after the woman refused to accept his <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a> friend request. Police said the woman works for a top modelling firm.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the accused, identified as Praful Mahadik, sent her a friend request in 2016. The 38-year-old woman did not accept the request and blocked him instead. The accused then created another account on Facebook and sent her a friend request. He kept creating new accounts and sending her friend requests, the police added.</p>
      <p>The accused told the police that in 2006, when he worked for a firm in Malad, he had seen the woman in a corporate park. He later sent her a friend request. But when she did not accept his repeated friend requests, he became angry and decided to defame her, the police said.</p>
      <p>Mahadik then started creating fake profiles of her. “He created two profiles on Facebook and two on Instagram. He did it with an intention to defame her, as he posted her pictures on the social media accounts with a message suggesting her family is involved in flesh trade,” a police officer said.</p>
      <p>The woman found out about the fake accounts after the accused started sending vulgar messages to her friends. During probe, the police started scrutinising the IP address of the suspect through which they managed to get his phone number. “We got his call data record and on Tuesday, we traced him at his brother’s residence in Ambivali. A team went there and arrested him,” an officer said. The accused is unmarried and lost his job two months ago.</p>
      <p>Mahadik was produced in court and has been remanded in police custody.</p>
