      <p>BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s foreign minister says he’ll raise with his Turkish counterpart the issue of a lawyer retained by the Germany embassy in Ankara who was arrested two months ago.</p>
      <p>Heiko Maas said Friday that Germany wants a “swift solution” and he plans to speak to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu about it on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in Japan.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters during a stop in Hiroshima, Maas said the arrest was “in no way comprehensible.”</p>
      <p>German officials are concerned that the lawyer, who was arrested mid-September, had sensitive documents on Turkish citizens seeking asylum in Germany that may now be in the hands of authorities in Turkey.</p>
      <p>Germany’s ambassador in Turkey, Martin Erdmann, said this week the embassy is “working hard to clarify the allegations” against the lawyer.</p>
