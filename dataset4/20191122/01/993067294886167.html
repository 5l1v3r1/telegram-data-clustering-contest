      <p>A WEST Belfast Irish language rap group has defended its advert for a forthcoming tour which features DUP leader Arlene Foster strapped to a rocket on top of a bonfire.</p>
      <p>A poster for Kneecap's tour appears to show <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/08/09/news/belfast-s-new-lodge-bonfire-stand-off-soon-escalated-to-violence-1681046/">the controversial New Lodge bonfire</a> with both Mrs Foster and Boris Johnson tied to a rocket while two men are seen clutching petrol bombs beneath the burning pyre.</p>
      <p>The image is being used to promote the rappers 'Farewell to the Union Tour'.</p>
      <p>The content of the advert however has been criticised for its "violence imagery".</p>
      <p>Subscribe to our most read headlines in the evening newsletter</p>
      <p>One social media user said that the rappers were "playing on real trauma experienced due to IRA violence".</p>
      <p>But the group, which includes rappers Móglai Bap and Mo Charahave, last night defended the imagery claiming it was "just a fine piece of art".</p>

      <p>In a statement they said: "The poster is for Kneecap's upcoming debut tour in England and Scotland.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to resonate with our English and Scottish comrades who also have to put up with the insufferable Tory party and their decimation of the working classes."</p>
      <p>When asked if they accepted that the posters could cause offence, they joked: "We don't mind if you’re offended, but just make sure you pay at the door, we take Northern Bank notes".</p>
      <p>The poster was uploaded to the Kneecap social media pages to advertise gigs in Glasgow, Liverpool and London in February.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time the Irish-language rappers have faced controversy.</p>
      <p>In January last year, a song by the group <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/01/02/news/song-by-west-belfast-irish-language-rap-duo-removed-from-rte-playlist-1223123/">was removed from an RTÉ playlist</a> because of its content.</p>
      <p>RTÉ's Irish language station Raidió na Gaeltachta removed the single 'Cearta', Irish for 'Right' from being played before the watershed due to its cursing and drug references.</p>
      <p>It also featured multiple references to sex and the PSNI.</p>
      <p>The rappers were also taken off stage during a gig at University College Dublin and they also led chants of 'Get the Brits out now' at the Empire Music Hall in Belfast, just 24 hours after Prince William and Kate Middleton had visited the pub.</p>
