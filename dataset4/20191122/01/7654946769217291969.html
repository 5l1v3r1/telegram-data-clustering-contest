      <h1>GOP senators gearing up for impeachment trial, may call on Hunter Biden</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:39:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:39</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Campanile and Aaron Feis</a></address>
      <p>Senate Republicans plan to confront the growing likelihood of an impeachment trial of President Trump head-on, fighting allegations of a quid pro quo with Ukraine by calling a slew of witnesses that could potentially include Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>A half-dozen GOP senators huddled with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner as the House impeachment hearing <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/trump-impeachment-hearings-fiona-hill-and-david-holmes-testify-on-capitol-hill/">wound down Thursday</a>, in an attempt to prepare for the next step, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/white-house-backs-full-senate-trial-if-house-impeaches-trump-072578">according to Politico</a>.</p>
      <p>Republicans hold enough seats in the Senate to, theoretically, quash an impeachment trial in its infancy — but sources told the outlet that there was a consensus in the meeting to let the process play out, both to stand up to the charges and affirm support for due process.</p>
      <p>“Different people have different opinions of what to do, but the main message [is] that a motion to dismiss won’t fly,” one attendee told Politico.</p>
      <p>A protracted impeachment trial could also allow the White House counsel to call and grill witnesses of their choosing.</p>
      <p>Number one on the list could be the younger Biden, who Republicans <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/republicans-want-to-call-hunter-biden-as-a-witness-in-impeachment-hearing/">wanted to question</a> during the House Intelligence Committee hearings, only to be stymied by Democratic control of the witness roster.</p>
      <p>“The Senate has great latitude,” said noted attorney Alan Dershowitz, an expert in constitutional law.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing about the impeachment proceedings [in the Constitution] other than you need two-thirds vote in the Senate, and the chief justice [of the Supreme Court] presides. Can they ask Hunter Biden to testify? Yes.”</p>
      <p>Republicans could question Biden about his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/15/hunter-biden-breaks-silence-on-foreign-dealings/">time on the board</a> of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a post the GOP says is suspicious considering his father being vice president.</p>
      <p>Trump requested in a July 25 phone call that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky probe the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in US aid money to the nation hung on the line, an ask that Democrats have alleged to be a quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>“They can bring in Hunter Biden and whoever they want to,” said Al D’Amato, who served nearly 20 years as a Republican senator from New York and chaired the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton in the mid-90s.</p>
      <p>“[But] I think it would be a political mistake,” D’Amato cautioned. “It would be seen as an obvious political ploy, just like the House proceedings.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Sens. Rand Paul and John Kennedy, of Kentucky and Louisiana, respectively, discussed the idea, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-consider-including-bidens-in-trump-impeachment-trial/2019/11/06/bde22272-fff3-11e9-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html">The Washington Post said</a>.</p>
      <p>And South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to turn over a trove of documents, including some related to the Bidens and Burisma.</p>
      <p>Both Kennedy and Graham were among the Republicans in Thursday’s meeting, according to Politico.</p>
