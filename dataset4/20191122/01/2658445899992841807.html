      <p> </p>
      <p>Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has renewed his call for the restructuring of the country’s governance architecture to address the “structural imbalances” in the federal system.</p>
      <p>He maintained that a fundamental restructuring of the federation is an “unavoidable step for equitable national governance based on respect for the rule of law, creation and sustenance of a participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, responsive governance”.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) stressed that his party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), included restructuring in its 2015 and 2019 manifestoes and had been working towards it in a bid to address the perceived structural imbalance.</p>
      <p>The restructuring, he said, must address critical issues, like writing the people’s constitution and the question of constitutional governance, the fundamental precepts of authorising principles of national togetherness, citizenship and national question.</p>
      <p>The governor also said it must address the political economy of federalism, including the allocation of public revenue, security sector governance, human rights, social justice, electoral system, system of government, among others.</p>
      <p>Fayemi spoke  on Wednesday while delivering a paper, titled: 20 Years of Democracy in Nigeria: Successes and Challenges, at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), Washington DC, United States.</p>

      <p>Also at the event were Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom; former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Martin Luther Agwai (retd.); former Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman, Prof Attaahiru Jega and a member of House of Representatives, Aishatu Dukku.</p>
      <p>There were also officials of the U.S Department of State, scholars and members of the civil society.</p>
      <p>In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, Dr Fayemi said Nigeria had made significant progress in consolidating democratic governance since the return of civil rule in 1999.</p>
      <p>The governor noted that “democracy is a journey and not a destination”.</p>
      <p>He urged Nigerians to always hold their leaders accountable to strengthen the nation’s democracy.</p>
      <p>Fayemi said democracy goes beyond the right to choose leaders through the ballot but the stimulation of civic engagement to better the lives of the citizens.</p>
      <p>The governor advised Nigerians to show more interest in governance, saying: “An indifference might be dangerous for democracy.”</p>
      <p>According to him, democratic institutions cannot be strengthened in a climate of apathy and “clinical disengagement”.</p>
      <p>He added: “The current phase of the struggle is, therefore, not just about maintaining the sanctity of the ballot but also holding those elected accountable and stimulating civic engagement in the public realm in a way that democratises ownership and improve the quality of life of our people.</p>
      <p>“We must banish the idea that governance is something performed by a team of gifted performers or strong men, while the rest of the citizens are spectators or complainers.”</p>
      <p>Ambassador Johnnie Carson of the USIP and Gen. Agwai led the discussion session after the governor’s presentation.</p>
