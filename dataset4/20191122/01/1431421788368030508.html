      <p>There was no game for Inter Aliyah A this week due to the international break, but the club’s representatives in IFLI’s League 2 had a night to remember, beating USSR 5-2 at home.</p>
      <p>Matt Keston’s men actually came from behind at their home pitch in Jaffa, as a defensive mistake gave the visitors an early lead. However, parity was restored thanks to a long-range Wagner Manuel strike, before Nicolas Straub grabbed a brace before half time.</p>
      <p>After the break, USSR found a way back into what became a heated game and with the score at 3-2, Inter needed to dig in their heels and maintain a fierce defense as USSR chased an equalizer. Yet Sebastian Israel converted a penalty and then Manuel got his second of the game from a free-kick to secure the three points. The all-Olim team leapfrogged its opponents into fourth place in the table. USSR was left in seventh place.</p>
      <p>Estudiantes TLV leads the league with 25 points, nine points ahead of second-place Los Gringos.</p>
      <p>In the IFLI’s top tier, Ra’anana and Atletico Niv are tied at the top with 21 points each, but Ra’anana has a game in hand. Ra’anana blanked Combo 5-0 on Saturday.</p>
