      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/General-Motors">General Motors</a> surprised <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fiat-Chrysler-Automobiles">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles</a> with a racketeering lawsuit that for the first time implicates late CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sergio-Marchionne">Sergio Marchionne</a> in a years-long corruption scheme that already has landed car executives and labour leaders in jail.</p>
      <p>The suit filed in federal court alleges Fiat <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chrysler">Chrysler</a> inflicted billions of dollars in damages by bribing United Auto Workers’ (UAW’s) brass for competitive advantages that the union denied to GM.</p>
      <p>The illicit payments benefited Fiat Chrysler starting in 2009, when the two companies were emerging from government-backed bankruptcies, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>Fiat Chrysler denied the allegations and said it assumed GM was trying to undermine active negotiations to clinch two deals the Italian-American company is eager to get done: a merger with France’s PSA Group and new contract with the UAW.</p>
