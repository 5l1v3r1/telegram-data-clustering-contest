      <p>A small group of climate change protesters have gathered outside Perth’s Duxton Hotel where a meeting of State energy ministers is being held.</p>
      <p>About 30 to 40 protesters holding flags and banners and chanting slogans are currently outside the hotel’s main entrance.</p>
      <p>There is little police presence, although several plain clothes officers are keeping an eye on the small crowd from a distance.</p>
      <p>It’s understood all State and Federal energy ministers are attending Friday’s Council of Australian Governments meeting.</p>
      <p>Groups including 350.org, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Extinction Rebellion WA are among the protest group.</p>
      <p>The banners they are holding include: “Save our children, government must act now” “listen to the science” and “climate emergency.”</p>
      <p>Some of the protesters - many of whom are middle aged - lay on the pavement.</p>

      <p>350.org organiser Anthony Collins handed a government official a petition asking State and Territory energy ministers to stand strong for climate action.</p>
      <p>Paddy Cullen, of the WA Conservation Council, said Friday’s meeting was an important moment.</p>
      <p>“At the moment we are seeing catastrophic droughts and fires right across Australia,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are hoping this (meeting) will be a turning point where these ministers make the leap on emissions...and they set a target to reach zero and a pathway to reach zero,” he said.</p>
      <p>Some of the protesters have indicated they will hold another protest outside Mark McGowan’s office in Rockingham on Saturday.</p>
