      <h1>'Frozen 2' has a bonus scene at the very end, plus another great reason to stay through the whole movie's credits</h1>

        <li>Warning: Minor spoiler ahead for <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/frozen-2">“Frozen 2.”</a></li>
        <li>Disney’s new movie “Frozen 2” has a post-credits scene, so don’t leave your seat right when the movie ends.</li>
        <li>Plus there are covers of the movie’s songs, performed by Kacey Musgraves, Panic at the Disco!, and Weezer that play as the credits roll.</li>

      <p>Disney has started a tradition of including post-credits scenes after its animated movies. First there was a <a href="https://www.insider.com/does-moana-have-end-credits-scene-2016-11">bonus scene at the very end of 2016’s “Moana,”</a> and now “Frozen 2” also ends with an extra little bit of fun.</p>
      <p>We’ll get to that post-credits scene in a second, but first, a less spoilery PSA for you all: The music playing over the credits for “Frozen 2” is three surprising cover versions of the movie’s musical numbers.</p>
      <h3>Kacey Musgraves, Panic at the Disco!, and Weezer all recorded alternate versions of the songs sung in ‘Frozen 2’</h3>

      <p>Three of the main songs in “Frozen 2” are the lullaby sung by Evan Rachel Wood’s character Queen Iduna (“All Is Found”), Elsa’s big first ballad (“Into the Unknown”), and Kristoff’s surprising ’80s-style song (“Lost in the Woods”).</p>
      <p>As the credits roll on “Frozen 2,” you hear pop versions of all three songs.</p>
      <p>Kacey Musgraves sings a quiet version of “All Is Found.” Then Panic at the Disco! does a powerhouse version of Queen Elsa’s song “Into the Unknown.” Last, but certainly not least, iconic pop-punk band Weezer recorded a version of Kristoff’s “Lost in the Woods.”</p>
      <p>It’s worth sitting through the credits for all of these alternate versions of the “Frozen 2” music alone, but then comes the post-credits scene.</p>
      <h3>Olaf does a cute retelling of the events of ‘Frozen 2’ in a mini post-credits scene</h3>

      <p>One of the funniest and most-meta parts of “Frozen 2” comes when Olaf does a dramatic retelling of what happened to Elsa and Anna in the first movie. His audience for that scene is the Northundra people and lost Arendelle soldiers.</p>
      <p>But in the post-credits scene, Olaf does another retelling. This time, he’s recounting what happened in “Frozen 2” (aka the movie you just watched), and his audience is the giant ice goblin from the first movie.</p>
      <p>The ice goblin, along with a bunch of mini ice-goblin babies, sits as a captive audience while Olaf tells them how Queen Elsa discovered her power as the fifth elemental spirit and the ending of “Frozen 2.” It’s a fun little meta-moment of storytelling, and if you sit through the credits for the music then it’s worth sticking around a few minutes more to see this bonus scene.</p>
