      <p>An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 on the Richter scale struck Dhundalwadi in Dahanu, Palghar at 7.30 am on Thursday. While no damage was reported, the district machinery was activated and put on alert. This is the second earthquake this week in Dahanu taluka.</p>
      <p>Dahanu taluka in Palghar has been receiving earthquake jolts since 2018, but the shocks had receded during the monsoon. The earthquake on Thursday lasted for only a few seconds. “It was a very strong quake as we could see things moving. But it stopped while we were all running outside,” said Mori Amle, a resident of Dhundalwadi village. She added, “We had forgotten what it was like to feel the ground shake as an earthquake had not occurred for days. Now that earthquakes have started again, I am scared.”</p>
      <p>This earthquake was the highest yet recorded, with the previous high being 3.2 on the Richter scale in April this year. “The earthquake’s epicentre was farther and the shocks were closer to the surface, so there was no localised damage,” said an officer from the collector’s office.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, seismologists from government and private agencies had found a dormant fault line passing near the region. “Shocks are being felt in the region due to the fault line, which was dormant till now. These earthquakes are just release of energy from the ground, and it is better if they keep occurring periodically instead of a sudden release of pent-up energy,” said an expert from the regional disaster management cell.</p>
      <p>The earthquakes, which had become a daily fixture, had led to mass evacuation of people in the 19 villages where the effect was felt in the taluka. “Before the monsoon, people were sleeping outside their homes as there were too many quakes. However, the shocks had receded during the monsoon, with days-long gaps between shocks. So, the locals had returned to their homes,” said an officer from the district administration. He added, “Anyway, because of the heavy rainfall, the people couldn’t sleep outside and the tents we had built have also been dismantled.”</p>
      <p>In Palghar, residents of villages are worried about the long term implications of earthquakes. “There’s no way to predict it. Who’s to know when it will come? So, I am not going to send my children to school for a few days,” said Girji Mahale, another villager. Her husband Barku Mahale, a farm labourer, said, “Nature has been cruel to us. We have no option but to leave for a better place, if there’s no help.”</p>
      <p>The district collector, Kailash Shinde, said the long term solution to prevent damage from earthquakes is to make houses resistant to these shocks. “The houses damaged will be rebuilt in a way that’s necessary for earthquake-prone zones. We can’t rebuild houses with no damage, but we will do retrofitting,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Retrofitting is a process to strengthen the structure of the house. Since it is a trained job, we are trying to recruit an expert team to tell us how to make the existing structures more resistant,” added Shinde.</p>
