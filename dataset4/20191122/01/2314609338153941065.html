      <h1>'Not his comfort zone': Malcolm Turnbull on innovation and Scott Morrison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:18:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:18</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Cormack</a></address>
      <p>Malcolm Turnbull has told a technology conference in Sydney that innovation is not Prime Minister Scott Morrison's "comfort zone ... he doesn't have the background or enthusiasm for it that I do".</p>
      <p>Mr Turnbull said Australia cannot "drop the ball" on innovation any longer and while "denialism might be a short term political advantage... if you deny reality long enough it mugs you."</p>

      <p>The former prime minister made the remarks during a lengthy interview at StartCon, a two-day technology, startup and corporate innovation conference.</p>
      <p>In the question and answer session with chief executive and founder of online jobs site Freelancer.com Matt Barrie, Mr Turnbull canvassed a range of issues including Australia's record on innovation, his time as prime minister driving the agenda and the National Broadband Network.</p>
      <p>"I think it's really important to explain innovation is not just about some smart people ... coming up with great ideas and making billions," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's a question of staying ahead. I think we've done a better job with trade than innovation, in terms of people understanding the importance of trade.</p>
      <p>"What government has to do is recognise - and I think I probably recognised this more than my predecessors or successors have done, because of my business background - everything has to be reviewed all the time. That terrifies people in Canberra."</p>
      <p>He said government could not assume a tax regime that was working five years ago "is still going to work today," telling the tech sector audience that they were "at the coalface, to use an outdated term that might find favour with the national party."</p>
      <p>Mr Turnbull, who served as communications minister in the Abbott government, said the need to keep up with ever-changing technology was critical, pointing to the much-maligned NBN as proof of how quickly things could change.</p>
      <p>"When Kevin Rudd announced the NBN in 2008, we were talking about how long it took you to download a file ... a movie ... but what we have now got is a world of concurrent streaming," he said, describing statistics that Australia's internet speed was ranked 62nd in the world as "absolute BS."</p>

      <p>"There is no comparable developed country which has as ubiquitous availability of high speed broadband as Australia.</p>
      <p>"In defence of the NBN ... ubiquitous broadband is a really good idea. The way Labor went about it was certifiably insane. I inherited a mess and I had to make the best of it ... very, very difficult circumstances."</p>
      <p>Asked what he thought of Mr Morrison's record on innovation, he said it was not the Prime Minister's "comfort zone".</p>
      <p>"He doesn't have the background or enthusiasm for it that I do," he said, not forgetting that "Scott was the treasurer when we agreed on the national innovation and science agenda. That wasn't just something that popped out of my head one morning, that was a process we worked on together."</p>
      <p>Mr Turnbull said innovation in Australia needed start with young people, saying it was critical to foster STEM education from a young age and to make stronger case for students to study "quantitative" subjects, such as science, engineering and maths.</p>
      <p>"The big conundrum is the relatively low percentage of women doing computer sciences and engineering," he told Mr Barrie.</p>
      <p>"I remember talking to [Facebook chief operating officer] Sheryl Sandberg about it ... in Silicon Valley the percentage of women doing these courses is lower than it was a generation ago. How crazy is that?"</p>
