        <b>easyJet exceeded seven million passengers in 2019 for the first time in Portugal, 8.6 percent more than in the previous fiscal year, which was “extremely positive”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“We closed the tax year in Portugal [concluded in September] with a record year. For the first time we surpassed the seven million passengers barrier, with 7.2 million, which corresponds to an increase of about 9 percent which is extremely positive, in a difficult environment where the infrastructure in the country does not give us the capacity to grow more sharply”, the director of easyJet for Portugal, José Lopes said, when presenting the carrier’s results.</p>
      <p>He continued: “It is interesting to note that we managed to grow in all four airports where we operate in the country, making a bet to reduce seasonality and, in the case of Lisbon, which is a congested airport, with some imagination”.</p>
      <p>“We have increased the number and size of the aircraft operated and with regard to winter, where there is still some remaining capacity, we have put more flights optimising our operation and improving our product to continue to grow”, the manager stressed.</p>
      <p>Referring to the difficulties in terms of airport infrastructure, such as Lisbon airport, José Lopes said that “it’s something that’s urgent”.</p>
      <p>“This year [last year] we grew by 9 percent, but we could be growing as in the last few years above 10 percent. We had been growing in double digits and due to the lack of infrastructure capacity there was a slowdown. For next year we will continue to grow above the easyJet average, but we will be growing below the 10 percent threshold,” he said.</p>
      <p>The manager also said that easyJet operates 66 routes and that it opened five more in the 2019 tax year “which have joined this portfolio”, and that the British airline expects “to continue now”, in the year begun in October, to grow and continue “its success story” in Portugal which has had an “extraordinarily positive impact” on the Portuguese economy.</p>
      <p>The easyJet director for Portugal also mentioned that the company has become the first major airline in the world to perform flights with “a zero net impact of carbon emissions [of its fuels] “, throughout its network, in an initial investment estimated at £25 million annually to buy 8.5 billion tonnes of carbon credits.</p>
