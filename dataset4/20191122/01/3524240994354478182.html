      <p><b>Arsenal striker</b> Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has reportedly postponed talks over a new contract with the North London club.</p>
      <p>The Gabon international is said to be considering a move away from the Emirates next summer amid interest from Barcelona, who are looking for a long-term replacement for Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Reports have suggested that Aubameyang will explore his options next summer if Arsenal once again fail to reach the Champions League.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Sport</i>, the striker is keen to know more about Barcelona’s interest before committing himself to a long-term deal at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has also recently responded angrily to criticism of his relationship with AFTV personality ‘Troopz’, describing the comments as “bulls**t”.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, who has eight Premier League goals this term, replaced Granit Xhaka as the club’s permanent captain earlier this month.</p>
