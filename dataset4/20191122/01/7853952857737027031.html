      <p>A Chinese national who worked for Monsanto before it was purchased by Bayer AG was indicted on Thursday on charges of stealing trade secrets, Reuters reports, citing the US Justice Department.</p>
      <p>Haitao Xiang, 42, who was employed by Monsanto from 2008 to 2017, was stopped by federal officials at a US airport before he could board a flight to China carrying proprietary farming software, the department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The indictment alleges another example of the Chinese government using Talent Plans to encourage employees to steal intellectual property from their US employers,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers said.</p>
      <p>Xiang’s lawyer, Eric Selig, said his client would plead not guilty at his arraignment, which has not been scheduled.</p>
      <p>China announced in 2008 its “Thousand Talents Plan” to recruit scientific researchers, which authorities in Washington have called a threat to US national security.</p>
      <p>“Xiang promoted himself to the Chinese government based on his experience at Monsanto,” Demers said.</p>
      <p>“Within a year of being selected as a Talent Plan recruit, he quit his job, bought a one-way ticket to China, and was caught at the airport with a copy of the company’s proprietary algorithm before he could spirit it away,” he said.</p>
      <p>Xiang is being held in Randolph County Jail in Illinois as he awaits a judge’s decision on bail, Selig said.</p>
      <p>He said Xiang, who has lived in the United States for 17 years and has a wife and daughter living in the country, is not a flight risk.</p>
      <p>Bayer completed its takeover of Monsanto in June 2018.</p>
