      <p>THE Nagari Nokowa Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association (NNAMORAL) on Thursday said none of its members were killed following violence between suspected transport unions at Akesan, Igando in Aliomosho Local Government Area (LGA) on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>NNAMORAL’s Chairman in Lagos State, Alhaji Sulaiman Jafo, described as mere rumour, news making the rounds that some people lost their lives in the violence.</p>
      <p>The Nation reported yesterday that at least two people, including one Lati Bashiru, were shot and several others injured after the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) clash.</p>
      <p>Several shops were said to have been looted and road users robbed of valuables as the hoodlums exchanged gunshots, bottles, charms and sticks which hit road users scampering to safety.</p>
      <p>Jafo, represented by the vice chairman of NNAMORAL Aliomosho Zone A, Mr. James Ahonye, lamented the violence and regretted the disruption of business activities during the clash.</p>
      <p>He said the union is committed to giving Lagosians hitch-free transportation.</p>
      <p>Jafo praised the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Igando division, Inspector Taiwo Kasumu for restoring peace to the area during and after the attack.</p>
      <p>He urged Igando residents to “resume their business activities with rest of mind, because the police have assured everyone of the security of their lives and property.”</p>
