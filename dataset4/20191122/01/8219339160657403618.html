      <h1>Twitter rolling out support for two-factor authentication without a phone number</h1>

      <p>At long last, Twitter is finally rolling out support for two-factor authentication without requiring a phone number. Twitter said it was “working on improving” its reliance on phone numbers back in September, and now the improved two-factor authentication options are <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1197621020229804054">rolling out to users</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Twitter added support for using code generating <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/20/twitter-two-factor-auth-third-party-apps/">applications for two-factor authentication.</a> But up until now, users were still required to add a phone number to their Twitter account as a fall back method of authentication.</p>
      <p>Starting today, Twitter is rolling out the ability to secure your account with two-factor authentication, without also supplying a phone number. What this means is that you can use a mobile security app, such as Authy or Google Authenticator, to generate two-factor authentication codes, without supplying Twitter with a phone number of any sort for fall back.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the implementation still isn’t perfect with security keys. A Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jcmi/status/1197649884645511168">engineer explains</a> that if you use a security key such as Yubikey, you’re still required to have a second method of authentication such as SMS or a two-factor application. This is because security keys are not supported outside of the web version of Twitter:</p>
      <blockquote>Currently we require you to have a second method along with security keys since the latter isn’t currently supported outside web. If you’d like to disable sms, you need to also have a mobile security app. We know this might not be ideal but we’re going to keep working on it!</blockquote>
      <p>Here’s how to set-up two-factor authentication on your Twitter account via the web:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the three dots in the sidebar on Twitter.com</li>
        <li>Click ‘Settings and Privacy’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Account’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Security’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Two-factor authentication’</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now, you can pick between text message, authentication app, and security key options for two-factor. And here’s how to remove your phone number from your Twitter profile:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the three dots in the sidebar on Twitter.com</li>
        <li>Click ‘Settings and Privacy’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Account’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Security’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Phone’</li>
        <li>Click ‘Delete phone number’</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Using a security key or authentication app two-factor is inherently more secure than SMS due to the growing prevalence of SIM swapping. Additionally, last month, Twitter disclosed that it “unintentionally” used two-factor phone numbers <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/08/twitter-two-factor-advertising/">for advertising targeting</a>.</p>
      <p>While Twitter’s implementation still isn’t perfect, it’s certainly nice to see the company making significant strides in this area.</p>
