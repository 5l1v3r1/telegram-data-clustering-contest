      <p>How would you describe life in Europe?</p>
      <p>It is calm and pleasurable, especially Belgium where I play. You know the country is quite peaceful, very calm; it is okay for people who just want a quiet lifestyle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>So, you think the country suits your personality?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, it does. I am not really the flamboyant type, I am more of the quiet and laid-back type. I don’t really fancy the spotlight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Does that explain your inactivity on social media?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, it does and I am okay with it. If you look at my Instagram handle, I mostly post pictures of my club actions; you hardly see all the fuzz and flamboyance. I am always like that, grown up to just embrace this low-profile kind of life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>So, how do you unwind then?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I am not the outing type, like I said earlier. I stay more of indoors and just chill.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i> That means you won’t enjoy the nightlife in Belgium?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I do, but not just a fan of it. I stay indoors, maybe once in a while hang out with friends, but I’m more of an indoor person.</p>
      <p> <b><i>Do you see yourself as a fashionista?</i></b></p>
      <p>I don’t know. I just wear what I feel comfortable in. I am not the type that goes into details of what he puts on. No, not all, as long as the clothes look good on me, anything about fashion matters little to me. But that doesn’t mean I’ll dress any how.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Ok, so do you like music?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Of course I do. I love listening to music.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Are you into Nigerian music or foreign?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t have a preference. I listen to good songs. Whether it’s Nigerian or foreign, as long as it is pleasant, I’m okay with it. But the Nigerian beats are good to listen to, too. I have been impressed with the hits being churned out, they’re really good.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>So, which Nigerian musical artiste do you like?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>They’re all good. From Wizkid to Burna Boy to Olamide, I don’t know, I just like good music and these guys are really trying.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Can you tell us about your favourite food?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I like beans and bread a lot. It is my favourite food.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Really?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t really know the reason for that, but I just like it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What about your favourite car?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>It is definitely Mercedes Benz. It is the brand I love most. I love the GLC and GLE models, they’re super wheels. Mercedez is sleeky, stylish and rugged. I like it.</p>
