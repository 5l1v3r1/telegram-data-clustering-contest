      <h1>OU men's basketball: Victor Iwuakor, bench help Sooners to lopsided win</h1>

      <p>NORMAN — Victor Iwuakor has hops.<br/><br/>When the freshman dunked over Maryland Eastern Shore on Thursday night, his legs reached his chest in just one example of his athleticism on career-high night in a lopsided win.<br/><br/>Oklahoma’s bench scored 33 points in the Sooners 91-64 win over Maryland Eastern Shore, with 13 of those points coming from Iwuakor. Oklahoma (5-0) struggled in the first half — trailing the Hawks (0-6) by one heading into the second half — but the energy from the bench helped the Sooners continue their undefeated start to the season.<br/><br/>When players like Iwuakor, Jalen Hill, Ku Kuath and Alondes Williams get in the game, they bring energy and athleticism with them for big dunks and shot blocks.<br/><br/>“In practice, coach always talks about bringing energy time,” Iwuakor said. “It doesn't matter if we're in first half or second half, we just got to bring the energy every time. So when I get on the basketball court, I always that chip on my shoulder.”<br/><br/>The team gets a lift when Iwuakor goes in the game, coach Lon Kruger said, but he’s not the only player coming off the bench who helped the Sooners on Thursday night. Hill and Kuath both scored 7 points each and combined for seven rebounds.<br/><br/>“Jalen and Victor combined I thought did a great job of keeping some balls alive on the offensive end, rebounding the basketball, making some good plays,” Kruger said.<br/><br/>The depth the Sooners have had early helps a lot, senior Kristian Doolittle said. Doolittle himself was perfect in the game, shooting 7-of-7 from the field, 1-of-1 from 3-point range and making all three of his free throws. But having a deep bench will help the Sooners later in the season, he said, and the opportunities the young players get early in the season, like the one they had Thursday night, will help instill faith in them.<br/><br/>“As we play game by game our coach tells us every game is a learning curve and so that's something that we have to learn from this game as well,” Doolittle said. “And that will benefit us toward the end of the season.”<br/><br/>The 13 points Iwuakor scored against UMES were a career-high for the freshman who averaged 4.8 points coming into the game. One of the Sooners most athletic players, he has already started to show improvement from the start of the season, just like the other freshmen around him.<br/><br/>“Victor's play now is so much different than it was in the opener just two weeks ago,” Kruger said. “So he's, again, going to keep getting better.”</p>
