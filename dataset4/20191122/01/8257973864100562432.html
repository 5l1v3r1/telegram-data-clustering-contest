      <h1>Trump says he won't allow Navy to strip emblem from SEAL who posed with corpse</h1>

      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> on Thursday said he won't allow the Navy to strip an emblem away from a SEAL who was convicted of posing with a teenage <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Islamic-State/?tps=1">Islamic State</a> fighter's corpse.</p>
      <p>Trump wrote<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197507542726909952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197507542726909952&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fus-news%2Ftrump-slams-navy-acting-against-seal-convicted-posing-isis-corpse-n1088356"> a tweet</a> criticizing the Navy's handling of the case of officer Edward Gallagher, stating he would ensure that Gallagher maintains the emblem that signifies his membership in the SEAL unit.</p>
      <p>"The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin," Trump wrote. "This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!"</p>
      <p>The president's statement comes after he <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/15/Trump-pardons-service-members-involved-in-war-crimes-cases/4151573863795/">restored Gallager's rank</a> to E-7, which he held before his conviction.</p>
      <p>Last month the Navy's top officer <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/10/30/Navy-upholds-punishment-for-SEAL-pictured-with-dead-IS-fighter/8481572433846/">upheld a jury's decision</a> that he be sentenced to four months confinement and loss of rank.</p>
      <p>Gallagher was charged with multiple war crimes, including shooting civilians in Iraq and murdering a wounded Islamic State fighter in 2017. A jury of mostly Marine combat veterans convicted him on only the photo charge.</p>
      <p>Trump had also ordered the Navy in August to rescind the medals awarded to Gallagher's prosecutors.</p>
