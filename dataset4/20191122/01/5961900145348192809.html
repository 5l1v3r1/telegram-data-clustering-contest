      <h1>This Giant Baby Jesus Statue In Mexico 100% Looks Like Phil Collins &amp; He’s My Easy Saviour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:56:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:56</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>It’s virtually impossible to completely determine what Jesus Christ actually looked like. Most Theologians suggest he was a rail-thin adonis with hair and beard for days. Some scientists claim he <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/jesus-was-one-ugly-dude-sorry/">had a head like a bucket full of burnt LEGO</a>. What form he actually took is a mystery that’ll likely never be solved, and is open to whatever interpretation you might see fit. All that said, here’s a giant-ass statue of Baby Jesus in a Mexican church that looks a hell of a lot like <b>Phil Collins</b>.</p>
      <p>The statue has been installed at a church in Guadalupe, and it quite possibly could be a new World Record for largest Jesus Baby statue.</p>
      <p>Standing at a reported 6.7 metres tall and weighing 900kg, it would easily outpace the current record holder, which is a paltry 4.8 metres and 299kg.</p>
      <p>The church’s priest stated that he had a 26-foot gap between floor and ceiling to fill, so he decided to order a 21-foot statue of the gargantuan infant child of God.</p>
      <p>And, again, the statue sure as shit looks like someone tacked Phil Collins’ 80s head onto body of a very big baby.</p>

      <p>There’s not a lot of doubt there, really. That’s a giant, nappy wearing Phil, watching lovingly over parishioners in Guadalupe.</p>

      <p>Does this mean the Church is suddenly reading from a very different book of Genesis? Will we have the entire parish rise and air drum the <i>In The Air Tonight </i>fill rather than clasp their hands in prayer? Will the priest be informing people of the pitfalls of Something Happening On The Way To Heaven?</p>
      <p>All hard to say at this point. What we do know is this: On the third day, he rose again.</p>
      <p>And lo, it was Phil.</p>
