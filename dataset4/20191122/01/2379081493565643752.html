      <h1>Gold steady amid mixed signals on U.S.-China trade talks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:34:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:34</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Gold prices were little changed on Friday</p>
      <p>as a report of China’s efforts to smooth the way for trade talks</p>
      <p>with the United States offset worries that an interim deal might</p>
      <p>not occur until next year.</p>
      <p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
      <p>* Spot gold was flat at $1,464.99 per ounce by 0106</p>
      <p>GMT, while U.S. gold futures inched higher 0.05% to</p>
      <p>$1,464.30.</p>
      <p>* China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new</p>
      <p>round of face-to-face talks in Beijing amid continued efforts to</p>
      <p>strike at least a limited deal, the Wall Street Journal reported</p>
      <p>on Thursday, citing unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>* China will strive to reach the agreement with the United</p>
      <p>States as both sides keep communication channels open, the</p>
      <p>Chinese commerce ministry said.</p>
      <p>* Washington passed two bills earlier this week intended to</p>
      <p>support protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China on</p>
      <p>its human rights policies.</p>
      <p>* Asian equities rose but gains were limited by persistent</p>
      <p>worries over the trade dispute.</p>
      <p>* U.S. President Donald Trump’s former Russia adviser Fiona</p>
      <p>Hill urged lawmakers in the House of Representatives impeachment</p>
      <p>inquiry on Thursday not to promote “politically driven</p>
      <p>falsehoods” that cast doubt on Russia’s interference in the 2016</p>
      <p>U.S. election.</p>
      <p>* The number of Americans filing applications for</p>
      <p>unemployment benefits was unexpectedly unchanged at a five-month</p>
      <p>high last week, suggesting some softening in the labor market.</p>
      <p>* Japan’s annual core consumer inflation ticked up only</p>
      <p>marginally in October despite the boost from a sales tax hike</p>
      <p>during the month.</p>
      <p>* Silver was little changed at $17.10 per ounce,</p>
      <p>palladium was flat at $1,760.76 per ounce and platinum</p>
      <p>edged down 0.4%, to $911.66.</p>
      <p>* A surge in investment buying will push the global platinum</p>
      <p>market into a small deficit this year – the first since 2016 –</p>
      <p>but a hefty surplus will return in 2020, the World Platinum</p>
      <p>Investment Council said.</p>
