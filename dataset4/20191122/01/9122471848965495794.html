      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:46:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>In just a few days, the Ohio State Buckeyes will host the Penn State Nittany Lions in a massive game for the Big Ten.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on Saturday afternoon’s game as the pregame shows for FOX, ESPN and the Big Ten Network will all be in Columbus for the game.</p>
      <p>Before the game kicks off, Ohio State released a graphic showing the number of people expected to tune into those respective shows. The Buckeyes expect more than 3.5 million people to be watching the pre-game action.</p>
      <p>In the graphic, Ohio State made sure former Michigan star and ESPN College GameDay analyst Desmond Howard was nowhere to be seen.</p>
      <p>Howard can be seen sporting Brutus the Buckeye’s head.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>Lee Corso is usually the one wearing headgear on College GameDay, but there’s clearly no room for Michigan Men on the Ohio State graphic.</p>
      <p>As for the game at hand, Ohio State enters as a heavy favorite. The Buckeyes have been one of the most dominant programs in the country this season. However, Penn State plays Ohio State about as tough as any team in the country.</p>
      <p>Can Penn State pull off the upset on Saturday?</p>
      <p>We’ll find out soon.</p>
