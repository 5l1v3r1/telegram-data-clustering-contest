      <p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian bond fund has started to divest Westpac (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/WBC.AX">WBC.AX</a>) bonds following allegations by the country’s financial crime regulator of money laundering compliance breaches, some of which related to financing child exploitation.</p>
      <p>Bill Bovingdon, chief investment officer of Altius Asset Management, which manages over A$2 billion ($1.36 billion), told Reuters its fund had downgraded the environmental, social and governance component of its credit risk score of Australia’s second-largest lender to “high” from “moderate”.</p>
      <p>“As a consequence of this change we have commenced an orderly divestment of our Westpac Senior secured debt holdings,” Bovingdon said.</p>
