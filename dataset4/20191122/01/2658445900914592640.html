      <p>OVER 800 residents of the eight communities in Tarkwa Bay Island, Lagos, have received free medical services from the 81 Division, Nigerian Army (NA).</p>
      <p>The medical rhapsody which was being conducted simultaneously in Lagos and Ogun States as part of Exercise Crocodile Smile IV was aimed at fostering civil-military relations and by extension gaining the people’s trust in security agencies.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that the army also donated exercise books to primary and secondary school pupils of the Island assuring them they were in the area for their safety and security.</p>
      <p>The locals who trooped out for the medical rhapsody said they were appreciative of the gesture especially because there was no functional hospital there.</p>
      <p>They appealed to the government to equip their Primary Health Centres, provide electricity in the community and give renovate fence their schools.</p>
      <p>A septuagenarian Mrs Mary  Anthony’s 55-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who said she suffered  from hypertension, praised the army for running several checks on her and giving her medications.</p>
      <p>“I have been suffering from high blood pressure for some time now. I was diagnosed with it at a private clinic and since then, I have been using some sachet medicines for N150 or N200 to control it but today, they have given me plenty drugs and told me how to use them.</p>

      <p>“But the soldiers did many tests on me today and then, they gave me drugs. They told me how to use the drugs too. They also gave me malaria drugs and I am grateful to them for all they have done.</p>
      <p>Director of Education Oluwalola Adeniniyi who has been on the Island for six years also pleaded with the state government to fence the schools there to protect pupils from danger.</p>
      <p>In an interview with reporters, Commander 81 Division Medical Services Col. Oludare Oni said the people’s response was encouraging, adding that prevalent issues were malaria, skin diseases, eye problem for older people and malnutrition in children.</p>
      <p>“You can see we have a side lab where tests are conducted before treatments commenced. We started with pregnant women and nursing mothers, children and the elderly. Treated mosquito nets were issued.”</p>
