      <h1>Milan offer Zlatan €6m</h1>

      <p><b>The</b> ball is in Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s court, as Milan reportedly offered a six-month deal with an option to extend the contract for an additional year, worth a total €6m.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old is set to leave MLS club LA Galaxy in December and a return to Milan looks very likely, after the reports on established contact between the player and club’s representatives.</p>
      <p>Now it’s reportedly up to the former Sweden international to make his choice, and the <i>Gazzetta dello Sport</i> claims that Milan has offered to pay the superstar €6m if he stays on for 18 months.</p>
      <p>It’s previously been suggested that Ibrahimovic would want €1m per month, but Milan look prepared to offer him one third of that.</p>
      <p>The initial deal offered by sporting director Zvonomir Boban to the player’s agent Mino Raiola is said to be a six-month contract. Over the phone, Zlatan has told Boban that he will decide on his future within a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Milan are back in Serie A action this weekend, when Napoli come to visit and need to respond from a slow start to the season, leaving them 14th in the League after 12 games.</p>
