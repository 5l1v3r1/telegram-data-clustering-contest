      <h1>California Loses Court Battle to Keep Trump Off Ballot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:25:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bronsonstocking" target="_blank">Bronson Stocking</a></address>
      <p>Not that it makes a difference in California politics, but a court has ruled that California can't keep President Trump's name off the ballot. Earlier this year, Democratic lawmakers passed a bill requiring presidential candidates to release five years of tax returns in order to qualify for the state's primary ballot. The bill goes to show just how crazy the Democrats can get when handed supermajorities in the state's two legislative bodies.</p>
      <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the "Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act" into law back in June, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/07/30/governor-gavin-newsom-signs-sb-27-tax-transparency-bill/">stating</a> that he agrees "with the Legislature that 'the State of California has a strong interest in ensuring that its voters make informed, educated choices in the voting booth.'" </p>
      <p>It looks like the legislature and Newsom never anticipated Michael Bloomberg entering the race. Bloomberg refused to release his tax returns back when he was running for mayor of New York City.</p>
      <p>The California Supreme Court ruled the bill violates the state's constitution. The LA Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-21/trump-taxes-ballot-california-supreme-court">reports</a>, "Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye, writing for the court, said the Legislature lacked the authority to create the 'unenforceable' requirement. The decision by the seven-member court — which now has a majority of Democrat-appointed justices — was unanimous."</p>
      <p>After the ruling, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy encouraged California Democrats to focus on the state's actual problems instead of "weaponizing the law for political purposes."</p>
