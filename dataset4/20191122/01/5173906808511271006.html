        <b>On the International Children’s Rights Day, IKEA presented the third edition of the “Vamos brincar na escola” competition. A challenge to all public primary schools to show projects that promote and encourage children to play more often and better.</b>
      </p>
      <p>From 20 November to 15 January, all public primary schools can submit their applications in https://vamosbrincarnaescola.ikea.pt/. Afterwards they will be reviewed by an evaluation committee and the two winning projects will be financed by the Swedish brand with the sales value of the soft toy range SAGOSKATT; available at IKEA stores.</p>
      <p>“At IKEA we take the topic of play very seriously. In addition to being a right of all children, established by the United Nations Convention, it also has proven benefits for wellness and development. Inspired by our vision to create a better everyday life for the many people, and knowing that children spend most of their time in school today, we want to contribute to a positive change”, explains Ana Barbosa, Sustainability Coordinator at IKEA Portugal.</p>
      <p>With the support of the Ministry of Education, since 2017, the “Vamos brincar na escola” initiative has already contributed to the improvement of playing conditions in four schools across the country - Glória Elementary School in Aveiro, Paradinha Elementary School in Viseu, School Da Sé in Braga and Rosa Lobato Faria Elementary School in Lisbon.</p>
      <p>The competition “Vamos brincar na escola” is part of the “Vamos brincar” campaign promoted by IKEA to inspire and motivate Portuguese families to understand the benefits of playing in good and safe conditions.</p>
      <p>IKEA stores will have a variety of commercial offers and activities for children, including the “Pequenos Designers IKEA”. From 20 November to 1 December, children are invited to design their dream teddy and the six best designs worldwide will be part of the IKEA range of cuddly toys next year.</p>
