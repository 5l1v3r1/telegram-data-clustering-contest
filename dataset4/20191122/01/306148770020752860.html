      <p><a href="https://it.slashdot.org/~hackingbear">hackingbear</a> writes: <i>Microsoft has been granted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977446/microsoft-huawei-us-export-license-windows-office-software">a license to export [mass market] software to Huawei</a> once again. The software giant was caught up in a long line of US-based technology companies that have been forced to comply with President Trump's executive order to crack down on Chinese tech companies. It's not immediately clear what "mass-market" refers to, but Microsoft sells Windows and Office licenses to Huawei. It's likely that Microsoft is at least able to sell Windows licenses to Huawei once again, which will help with Huawei's server solutions and its Windows-powered laptops. Microsoft is part of a number of US companies that are starting to get licenses to supply goods to Huawei once again. Huawei <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/facts/voices-of-huawei/ren_zhengfeis_interview_with_sky_news">has been anticipating a fight with the US</a> and prepared and <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1165293.shtml">succeed in replacing American (electronic) technologies</a> with its own home-grown replacement for almost two decades after <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/388235c4-3b61-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0">Motorola foolishly rejected the chance of acquiring Huawei</a>, China's most successful hi-tech company worth at least $100 billion today, over a bargaining price of $7.5 billion. "When this decision was made, I told them [Huawei executives], if we continued to work in this sector, we would definitely be in a race against the US in 10 years. We had to prepare", said then Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei after the merger fell through. However, software ecosystems, i.e. Windows and Android, remain Huawei's Achilles' heel.</i></p>
