      <p>Normally, major 5G network expansion news has been exciting enough for carriers to announce first thing in the morning, but AT&amp;T just continued its already confusing 5G story by revealing a big change in the dead of night: It's launching a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/22/att-promises-low-band-5g-for-5-cities-in-weeks-15-by-early-2020/">low-band 5G network across five cities in "the coming weeks,"</a> with promises to cover at least 15 cities by February 2020. From a report:<i> This will be the carrier's first 5G launch targeted at regular customers. The good news: Some form of AT&amp;T 5G service will soon be available in Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Providence, Rochester, and San Diego, followed by Birmingham, Boston, Bridgeport, Buffalo, Las Vegas, Louisville, Milwaukee, New York City, San Francisco, and San Jose early next year. Initial service maps actually cover wide swaths of each city, in some cases extending into suburbs, and the carrier suggests the low-band 5G will work at roughly two-mile distances from towers, including "on the go," residential," "suburban," and "rural" usage.</i></p>
