      <p>The Master Planning process will develop the detailed long-term plan for Subi East, providing a roadmap to guide future growth and development.</p>
      <p>Over the past 18 months, the State Government has conducted an on-line survey, sent to 23,000 households, businesses and visitors, hosted community pop-up sessions attended by more than 180 local residents and undertaken extensive engagement around plans for Subi East.</p>

      <p>“Subi East will be one of the most significant Western Australian urban redevelopment projects ever undertaken, and will see the transformation of 35ha of land on the doorstep of the Perth CBD into a thriving community focused inner-city village,” Planning Minister Rita Saffioti said.</p>
      <p>“Feedback in the lead-up to the Master Planning process has indicated broad support from the wider community for Subi East, which will breathe new life into one of Perth’s oldest and best-loved suburbs.</p>
      <p>“The Master Planning process will allow us to consider some of the feedback and additional matters raised during engagement to date.</p>
