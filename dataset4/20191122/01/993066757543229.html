      <p>A UUP MLA was asked during a unionist protest meeting against Boris Johnson's Brexit deal to use his military experience in the British Army to "drill them".</p>
      <p>The plea to Doug Beattie, a former Army captain, reportedly drew some cheers from the packed crowd at an Orange Hall in Portadown.</p>
      <p>Mr Beattie said he rejected the suggestion which came from a lone individual, and said there is "no place in our society for violence".</p>
      <p>Hundreds attended the meeting on Wednesday night to voice concerns over the British prime minister's proposed EU withdrawal agreement.</p>

      <p>It has led to concerns that loyalist paramilitaries could become involved in orchestrating campaigns of civil disobedience in protest.</p>
      <p>The Portadown event was the latest in series of meetings organised across the north.</p>

      <p>Mr Beattie spoke to the crowd on a panel alongside DUP MLA Carla Lockhart, independent unionist councillor Paul Berry and loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.</p>
      <p>The Ulster Unionist yesterday said that one audience member had said "that peaceful demonstration didn't work".</p>
      <p>"I was asked from the floor to use my military experience to drill them," the Upper Bann MLA added.</p>
      <p>Mr Beattie said he was "certainly not going to support" the suggestion.</p>
      <p>Asked if the idea received support in the room, he said: "People cheered at various different things. That was mentioned in the room but it was quite clear that I was there as a politician and not some form of military commander – and who only supports peaceful means.</p>
      <p>"There is no place in our society for violence."</p>
      <p>Mr Berry described the pressures on unionism, and warned that "we don't want to live in a vacuum where paramilitaries take over here".</p>
      <p>"There is a deep sense of betrayal here," he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Bryson said the room was "packed to capacity" and there was a sense of "palpable anger".</p>
      <p>"The message is that people aren't tolerating an economic united Ireland – we're not having this," he added.</p>
      <p>Ms Lockhart was also asked for her thoughts on the meeting. She said she would discuss issuing a comment through the DUP press office, but none was issued last night.</p>
