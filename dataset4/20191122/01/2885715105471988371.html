      <p><b>India vs Bangladesh (Ind vs Ban) 2nd Test Live Cricket Score Streaming Online:</b> The stage is set for the first Day/Night Test on Indian soil as the 2nd Test of the series between India and Bangladesh starts at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Friday, November 22. Much of the focus before the match has been on how the pink ball will behave and how the 22 players – India and Bangladesh are one of the few remaining Test nations who have not played Day/Night matches – will adapt.</p>
      <p>The greenish surface which was on display on Thursday will give India a huge advantage, given the quality of pace attack they have. A five-bowler strategy cannot be ruled out. Bangladesh, without their two most experienced cricketers – Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan – will be up against it to series the level after the capitulation in Indore last week,</p>
