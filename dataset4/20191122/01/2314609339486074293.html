      <h1>Senior activists tape mouths shut protesting Brisbane library ban</h1>

      <p>Senior climate activists have staged a silent demonstration outside Brisbane's City Hall, taping their mouths shut in protest of lord mayor Adrian Schrinner's decision to ban them from booking rooms at public libraries.</p>
      <p>The Extinction Rebellion subgroup Grey Power stood outside City Hall on Friday morning with their mouths taped shut and holding signs calling for action on climate change, following revelations the Queensland Human Rights Commission is investigating the council's ban.</p>

      <p>Cr Schrinner announced in October that public libraries would no longer accept bookings from Extinction Rebellion and other activist groups for meeting rooms, insisting the group were plotting illegal activities.</p>
      <p>Activist Miree Le Roy made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission last month, which the commission accepted for investigation earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The council and Ms Le Roy will now have to participate in compulsory conciliation to address the issue in late December.</p>
      <p>As about 30 activists stood outside City Hall, some passers-by joined in or stopped to ask what was happening.</p>

      <p>Ms Le Roy said the activists believed the ban was "100 per cent" discriminatory and was treating Brisbane ratepayers who were also protesters with disrespect, labelling them "anarchists".</p>
      <p>"Effectively what they're trying to do is to single out groups of people in the community who have genuine concerns, in this case about climate change in particular, and stop them using facilities to organise protests or information sessions," she said.</p>

      <p>"Extinction Rebellion is a non-violent direct action group, so one of the messages that the council has tried to send out is these are violent groups. They're not violent groups.</p>
      <p>"They are ratepayers, they are really concerned about the climate and they need to wake people up, we need to wake people up.</p>
      <p>"To have the council try and shut us down based on what we believe is actually illegal."</p>
