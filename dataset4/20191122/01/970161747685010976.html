      <p><b>Nobody ever listens</b><br/>That was interesting news regarding the excellent sales numbers for the latest Pokémon game. I have noticed this year that games that don’t review that well are managing to still sell well, are game reviews becoming more and more obsolete? I still look for review scores and if a game I am looking forward to scores a lot of low scores then I won’t buy it.</p>
      <p>Also, following on from the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/gamers-are-the-worst-thing-about-video-games-readers-feature-11071417/">Reader’s Feature</a> regarding the worst thing about video games are gamers (which I agree with) why are some people proud of liking rubbish games like Agents Of Mayhem? Then when a good game gets released they say nonsense like, ‘I played a half hour of The Outer World’s and deleted it’ while pre-ordering every bang average Call Of Duty or Assassin’s Creed. They seem happy playing the same two or three games every year. I just don’t get it.<br/><b>ROB</b></p>

        <i><b>GC:</b> Badly reviewed games have been selling well since gaming began. If anything, reviews have more prominence today than they ever have, as a source of things for people to argue about on the Internet – even if there’s still only a small percentage of people that follow their advice.</i>

      <p><b>Modern miracle</b><br/>Thank you for your fair and reasoned review of Shenmue III. In a way, it’s a very difficult game to review given the circumstances behind it, so appreciate your mature and calm review. As a day one backer and a fan since the original game nearly 20 years ago, I can completely understand the criticisms made at the game but am able to accept them, warts and all. I’m a couple of hours in the new game and finding it difficult to adapt to its rhythm, but I felt exactly the same with the first two games. Once it clicked, I was hooked and many of my favourite gaming memories are Shenmue related.</p>
      <p>A lot of gaming news these days tends to be on the negative side, so there’s something miracle-like about the fact that the third game exists and I truly, truly hope that the series will continue. For those still on the fence, I strongly recommend giving the first two games a try and to have a little patience. As mentioned, once you adapt to the games’ rhythm, it becomes a very rewarding experience.</p>
      <p>I am very happy that Yu Suzuki was finally given the chance to make his dream project. May there be many more.<br/><b>bcdcdude</b></p>

      <p><b>Their way</b><br/>Enjoyed the Shenmue review, I’m surprised you scored it, you must have been tempted not to bother. The lack of story closure does feel like hubris from ol’ Yu, I was kind of expecting a cliffhanger and a fourth game resolution, but he obviously has designs to make this run forever if he can. Now he has his engine and assets modelled in current tech maybe a fourth one can be turned out pretty quickly and cheaply. Maybe aiming for Switch would have been a better shout, given its weaker power spec they could have got away with putting out a PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 style open world game in terms of graphical and character model fidelity, putting more resources into the content. Even the HD rerelease of the originals would probably still look good on the small screen. Admittedly the Switch was very much still on the drawing board in 2015 when this was announced.</p>
      <p>It’s interesting that Shenmue 3 and Death Stranding, two games from old school auteurs, have come out around the same time. One thing that continues to frustrate me with current big budget gaming is (like blockbuster movies) how focus=grouped and charmless it is, trying to please everyone just makes it grey and boring. I love an out there indie as much as the next person but their short nature and limited scope (understandable given the finances) can be a drag. Kojima’s and Yu’s games might be failures on some level but that they’ve taken the money and said, ‘Sod it, I’m doing it how I want’ warms my heart…<br/><b>Marc</b></p>

      <p><b>Carry on carrying on</b><br/>I’m pleasantly surprised by the generally positive-ish response to Shenmue 3.</p>
      <p>Short of modernising the combat (shame they didn’t) I don’t see much that could have been done to update the series without making it not really Shenmue anymore.</p>
      <p>So, realistically, ‘faithful continuation of the series’ was always going to be the best case scenario and I was pretty dubious they’d even be able to achieve that given the relatively small budget and some of the dodgy-looking preview footage.</p>
      <p>I actually thought Shenmue 2 was poor and gave up then after having loved the first game – there weren’t enough sailors – but I hope Shenmue 3 sells acceptably so that those that do like it can carry on enjoying the series.<br/><b>Charlie</b><br/>PS: I did play the Xbox port of Shenmue 2 though, rather than the Dreamcast one, so maybe it was an inferior version, can’t remember what was said on that at the time.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>GC:</b> The combat is probably the most changed element of the gameplay, and a step down from the Virtua Fighter lite system of the originals.</i>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Reading between the lines</b><br/>What GC wrote about Shenmue 3 (paraphrased):</p>
      <p>It’s okay, if you’re a fan then you’ll love it.</p>
      <p>What I read:</p>
      <p>An effervescent, detailed, painstakingly intricate and magnificent world to traverse and explore. Transport yourself to a different time and engulf yourself in the splendid, epic and wonderful adventure that Shenmue 3 begets.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Shenmue 3 is deliciously and unapologetically old-school and is more delicious than a Popeyes Chicken Sandwich.</p>
      <p>Buy it now!</p>
      <p>I have – thanks GC!<br/><b>Commodore Fan</b></p>

      <p><b>Japanese awards</b><br/>As far as I can see there are only two real contenders for The Games Awards Game of the Year: Sekiro Shadows Die Twice and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Both Japanese games I might point out, as our four out of the total of six contenders – so I guess Japan really is back after having a bad time of it last year.</p>
      <p>For me the best game of the year is definitely Sekiro. Resident Evil 2 is great an all but it is just a remake and as great as it was as a bit of fan service I don’t think it did enough to really transform the game, which isn’t an actual criticism but it is my reason not to give it the top prize.</p>
      <p>The difficult thing is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is amazing and since it is eligible, and wasn’t last year I think it has to be that. But it’s hard. The two games have literally nothing in common and I really don’t know how you’re supposed to choose between them. My gut says that Smash will have a more lasting impact on gaming though and hits its marks with slightly more precision than Sekiro.</p>
      <p>As long as Death Stranding doesn’t win I’ll be happy though.<br/><b>Clawfiend</b></p>

      <p><b>One-armed bandit</b><br/>I’m currently reduced to one-handed gaming following surgery and will be for a few weeks. This is frustrating as the time off would have been a prime opportunity to work through some of my gaming backlog, however I am unable to operate a controller.</p>
      <p>So, I was wondering if GC or its readers could recommend any games on the Switch that can be played with the touchscreen? Will try any genre, although have never enjoyed tower defence type games.<br/><b>ProEvoSan78 (PSN ID)</b></p>

        <i><b>GC:</b> Without wanting to make any jokes about Dead Or Alive Xtreme, we’re not really sure what to suggest beyond mobile games.

      <p><b>Not bad</b><br/>Given the absence of anyone else talking about it I’m going to assume that others are either ashamed to admit it or I’m the only one here who’s bought it, but I’ll come out and say it, ‘Hi, my name’s Antony and I have Google Stadia’.</p>
      <p>I pre-ordered it day one, as I’m a sucker for new tech and I have severe distrust of most ‘influencers’ who always have their own agenda, whether that’s a paid one or their own need to sensationalise everything. Anyway, it was cheap enough to just buy it and see for myself.</p>
      <p>It’s definitely not plug and play… downloading Google Home app on my phone to set up the Chromecast, then the Stadia app on my phone and entering codes and opting out of every privacy invading and geo-tracking policy they try to get you to opt into was nothing like any console that’s gone before.</p>
      <p>However, now that’s done and it’s up and running, it’s not bad.</p>
      <p>I’ve not had any undue lag, certainly nothing that’s inconsistent or impacted my ability to play a game. Plugging the Ethernet cable into the power supply seemed odd at first, but it’s actually much more convenient to me there. as my router is plugged in alongside it and in easy reach.</p>
      <p>Still unusually apathetic to the thing though, normally chomping at the bit for a new console, but then I guess this isn’t one.</p>
      <p>It works well, for me at least, only time will tell if I keep the subscription going when the free 4K period ends.<br/><b>Antony White</b></p>

      <p><b>This week’s Hot Topic</b><br/>The subject for this weekend’s Inbox was suggested by reader Xane, who asks whether you have a favourite console manufacturer?</p>
      <p>Do you consider yourself loyal to Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo or anyone else and how far would you take that loyalty? Do you only buy their consoles or do you also consider other brands? If you only buy one or two consoles per generation how often do you switch loyalties and did that happen this generation?</p>
      <p>Do you already have a preference for next generation, despite there being no concrete information, and are you prepared to give your favourite a certain amount of leeway before considering buying a competitor?</p>
