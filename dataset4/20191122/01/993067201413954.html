      <h1>DUP's Peter Robinson returns to election trail to support Emma Little-Pengelly</h1>

      <p>FORMER DUP leader Peter Robinson has returned to the election campaign trail to support Emma Little-Pengelly's bid to retain her Westminster seat.</p>
      <p>Mr Robinson was credited as the chief strategist behind Ms Little-Pengelly's campaign when she became South Belfast MP for the Democratic Unionists in 2017.</p>
      <p>He was pictured canvassing with his former special adviser and party councillor David Graham earlier this week in the Stranmillis area of the tightly fought constituency.</p>
      <p>Posting the selfie on Facebook, she wrote: "Out in Stranmillis all afternoon and still here! Come and say hello if you see us out and about!"</p>
      <p>Ms Little-Pengelly is likely to come under pressure in the December 12 poll after Sinn FÃ©in and the Greens stood aside in South Belfast in favour of other pro-Remain parties.</p>
      <p>She won South Belfast in 2017 with 13,299 votes, ahead of nearest rival Alasdair McDonnell of the SDLP on 11,303.</p>
      <p>The Green Party is backing the SDLP's candidate Claire Hanna for the seat, but she could face competition from Alliance's Paula Bradshaw who came third in 2017 with 7,946 votes.</p>
      <p>For 2017's election, Mr Robinson was campaign manager for Ms Little-Pengelly, who was one of his special advisers at Stormont when he was First Minister.</p>
      <p>The South Belfast MLA paid tribute in her victory speech to Mr Robinson.</p>
      <p>"I know that Peter has come out of retirement to come and support me in this campaign and he has been absolutely invaluable," she had said.</p>
