      <h1>Hays Travel to create 17 jobs in Northern Ireland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan McAleer</a></address>
      <p>HAYS Travel, which bought Thomas Cook's portfolio of high street stores, has said it will create another 17 jobs in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The pledge came as the Sunderland travel group announced plans to create 1,500 new jobs and apprenticeships across the UK.</p>
      <p>Thomas Cook collapsed in September. Hays Travel paid receiver KPMG £6 million for the 555 UK stores leased by holiday group.</p>
      <p>Hays Travel said yesterday it had reopened 450 branches in the last six weeks, taking its overall store count to 737.</p>
      <p>To date, it has offered permanent contracts to 2,300 former Thomas Cook workers.</p>
      <p>Hays' acquisitions includes 22 former Thomas Cook stores in the north.</p>
      <p>The travel firm said yesterday said it needs a total of 17 people for its expanded Northern Ireland operation.</p>
      <p>It includes nine travel consultants, five foreign exchange specialists and three assistant branch managers.</p>
      <p>The company has also said it hopes to hold discussions with organisations in Northern Ireland over its plans to recruit apprentices.</p>
      <p>Jointly owned by John and Irene Hays, the travel firm has revealed plans to create 200 more permanent jobs in its Sunderland head office, bringing its headcount there to 700.</p>
      <p>The additional jobs announced yesterday will eventually bring Hays Travel's total workforce to 5,700.</p>
      <p>John Hays said: “We're further increasing staffing to ensure we have the highest customer service levels across all of our stores and our head office functions.</p>
      <p>“These are fantastic permanent career opportunities for people who want to take a step into an exciting industry where every day is different.</p>
      <p>“You don't necessarily need travel experience – just an enthusiasm for travel, a good head for numbers for the foreign exchange posts and some customer service experience of any kind would be helpful.”</p>
