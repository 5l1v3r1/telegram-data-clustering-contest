      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:51:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma tight end Grant Calcaterra, who has missed much of this season due to an undisclosed injury, announced his retirement from football tonight.</p>
      <p>In a heartfelt video released on Twitter, Calcaterra confirmed reports that he suffered a concussion last month. The injury occurred during practice, and Calcaterra admitted he’s had his “fair share” of concussions in his career.</p>
      <p>Since then, Calcaterra said he has been undergoing evaluation and weighing his options for his future. Ultimately, the decision was made to walk away from the game he calls “the biggest thrill of my life.”</p>
      <p>“I spent countless hours visiting with OU medical professionals and specialists around the country. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that it would be best for me to step away from the game,” Calcaterra said. “This has been the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make in my life, but I haven’t been alone. I’ve been able to stay positive throughout this process with the help of my family, close friends, girlfriend, teammates, coaches and different OU staff members. I want to thank each and every one of you for being there when I needed it most.”</p>

      <p>After a strong freshman campaign in 2017, Calcaterra enjoyed a breakout 2018 season. He recorded 26 receptions for 396 yards and six touchdowns, earning All-Big 12 First Team honors.</p>
      <p>In five games this season, Calcaterra compiled five receptions for 79 yards.</p>
      <p>Best of luck to Grant on his future away from football. Health is more important than anything.</p>
