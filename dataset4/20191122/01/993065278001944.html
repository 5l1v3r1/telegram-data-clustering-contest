      <p>FOUR Catholic grammar schools are seeking extra places to cope with a rise in pupils.</p>
      <p>Almost 1,300 more children transferred from P7 to post-primary level this year compared to last, meaning many missed out on their first choice school.</p>
      <p>Officials had already started looking at creating additional places to cope with demand next year, although numbers are not expected to rise as sharply again.</p>
      <p>Now, four Catholic schools are bidding to expand from 2020.</p>
      <p>They are St Malachy's College, Our Lady and St Patrick's College and Aquinas Grammar in Belfast, as well as Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.</p>
      <p>Details of the plans are contained in a series of pre-publication consultations released by the Education Authority (EA).</p>
      <p>One of the documents explained that over the past decade Aquinas had been over-subscribed "and witnessed the disappointment of parents and young pupils with grades A and B which would usually gain admission to the grammar school sector".</p>
      <p>An increasing population and all-A intake has added to the pressure.</p>
      <p>More recently, the situation has been made worse by over-subscription in Rathmore Grammar and Our Lady and St Patrick's, which share parts of their catchment area with Aquinas.</p>
      <p>This has created a `ripple' effect onwards to St Malachy's.</p>
      <p>Approving the plans would enable more Year 8 pupils the opportunity to avail of a Catholic grammar education.</p>
      <p>Aquinas wants to increase from 770 to 910, admitting 130 pupils every year instead of 110.</p>
      <p>Our Lady and St Patrick's would grow to 1,330 from 1,260, and admit 10 more first years annually.</p>
      <p>St Malachy's would also increase by 20 places while Assumption would accept an extra 10.</p>
      <p>Final proposals are expected to be published in the new year.</p>
      <p>The EA has also published a `development proposal' to allow Strathearn School in east Belfast to grow.</p>
      <p>"Due to a growing demand for post-primary places in Belfast many schools, non-selective and selective, are experiencing increasing pressure from parents and the local community to make more places available," the EA said.</p>
      <p>"It is planned to bring forward a suite of proposals for the Belfast area to make adjustments to selective and non-selective schools.</p>
      <p>"The proposal from Strathearn School is being brought forward in advance of the full suite of proposals."</p>
      <p>There has been previous criticism over awarding places to grammars when neighbouring colleges have empty desks.</p>
      <p>The Department of Education will typically reject expansion bids if officials believe they may have an adverse impact on other post-primaries, or if there is surplus capacity nearby.</p>
      <p>However, Aquinas was given 20 extra places this year, while St Joseph's next door still had space.</p>
      <p>Professor of Education at Queen's University Belfast, Tony Gallagher, said it was "entirely predictable".</p>
      <p>"During the period of falling rolls grammar schools increased the proportion of the cohort they accepted, to the detriment of secondary schools," he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Now that overall enrolments are rising they want to expand still further."</p>
      <p>He later added: "When academic selection was started about 17% were 'selected' for grammar schools. By the 1980s this had risen to 22%. After open enrolment it rose to 30%. After a long period of falling rolls it rose to 40%. Now they want more. So what exactly does 'selective' mean now?"</p>
