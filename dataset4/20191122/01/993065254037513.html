      <h1>Henderson group creates 14 jobs with new £500k in-house kitchen operation</h1>

      <p>SPAR owner Henderson has announced a £500,000 investment in new kitchen facilities in Randalstown, creating 14 jobs.</p>
      <p>The Mallusk-based food group, which employs 3,700 people, said the move by its wholesale division includes the appointment of Spar's first in-house head chef in the north.</p>
      <p>Carl Johannesson, a former executive chef with the well-known Belfast-based James Street South Group, will head up the new team, which will be tasked with creating a new range of restaurant quality meals. The new range will initially be available from a number of Eurospar stores.</p>
      <p>The new products will be branded ‘The Chef', which Henderson's say will be made in small batches, using quality ingredients.</p>
      <p>The range will involve the collaboration of Henderson's wholesale and foodservice operations, using local suppliers K&amp;G McAtamney, Bradmount Foods, Elmore Fish Ltd., Big Pot Co. and Daily Bake.</p>
      <p>Henderson's fresh foods director Neal Kelly said the group has continued to invest in food ranges based around Irish produce.</p>
      <p>“Combining both our consumer and market knowledge, we have developed products with chef Carl which can be bought when there is a need for a home cooked meal without the time it takes to cook from scratch, or even a midweek treat.</p>
      <p>“Some of the products are those which shoppers may not expect to find in our stores but which we know will be incredibly popular.”</p>
      <p>Chef Carl Johannesson added; “My team and I will be cooking wholesome food for hundreds of shoppers to enjoy every day without compromising on quality and flavour, that I would happily serve in a restaurant.</p>
      <p>“We're confident to be bringing this level of quality food to the shelves of local stores and can't wait for local shoppers to enjoy it.”</p>
