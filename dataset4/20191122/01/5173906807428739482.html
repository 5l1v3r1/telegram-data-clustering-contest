        <b>Portugal’s flag carrier TAP is to start flying, in early 2020, to three new destinations in Brazil (Maceió), Canada (Montreal) and the US (Boston), and this connection to the US will be to and from Ponta Delgada in São Miguel island.</b>
      </p>
      <p>TAP said that the three new connections meet the company’s strategy of focusing on the Americas and reinforce the trend of strong growth of activity in the Brazilian market and the North Atlantic.</p>
      <p>With the new connections between Lisbon and Montreal and between Ponta Delgada and Boston, TAP increases its North Atlantic routes to 11, almost four times more than in 2015.</p>
      <p>Cited in the statement, TAP’s CEO, Antonoaldo Neves, said that this is another important step in the diversification and expansion plan of the company’s network, which reinforces its exposure to new and less volatile markets, adding that the 11 North Atlantic routes are in line with the number of routes to Brazil.</p>
      <p>The new connection to Montreal, Canada, will have six weekly journeys, with flights leaving the Portuguese capital every day of the week, except on Wednesdays, at around 2.55pm.</p>
      <p>The opening of the Ponta Delgada-Boston route will join Lisbon-Boston, making the carrier have two direct connections with JetBlue’s hub city (TAP’s partner), which will allow it to increase the number of passengers coming from various points in the US.</p>
      <p>With these new routes and other increases in supply, TAP estimates to transport between Portugal and the North Atlantic more than 390,000 North American nationals (85,000 on both routes) next year.</p>
      <p>The statement stated that TAP currently transports close to one million passengers from North America, which already represents one of the carrier’s three main markets.</p>
      <p>The connection to Maceió, which will be operated with Airbus 321LR, will be TAP’s 11th to Brazil, being the first time in five years that the company announces a new route to this country.</p>
