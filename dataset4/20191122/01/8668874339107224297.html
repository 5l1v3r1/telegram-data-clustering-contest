      <h1>Semi Radradra reportedly willing to take a massive pay cut to return to rugby league</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:31:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:31</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Former Australian winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bordeaux/players/semi-radradra/">Semi Radradra</a> is reportedly willing to take a $2 million pay cut to join South Sydney Rabbitohs.</p>
      <p>Radradra, who starred for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji">Fiji</a> at the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> in Japan, is homesick in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> and wants to return to the NRL, according to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>France’s cold weather and family reasons are cited as other reasons for the 27-year-old’s willingness to take a major pay cut in order to switch codes once again.</p>

      <p>Radradra scored 82 tries in 94 matches for Parramatta between 2013 and 2017, before joining <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon">Toulon</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>Last year, he signed for Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>The Fiji union international has been linked with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and his former club the Eels, but reportedly prefers a move to the Rabbitohs.</p>
      <p>“Apparently Souths are looking at every player, but first we’ve got to sort out what the go is with Sam (Burgess),” Souths hooker Damien Cook told <i>Sporting News</i>.</p>
      <p>“But <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji/players/semi-radradra/">Semi Radradra</a> is a quality player and he did a great job when he was in the NRL. He’d be a great asset to most clubs.</p>
      <p>“Who knows? We will see how it plays out.”</p>
      <p>Radradra made history at the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> in Japan, becoming the first tier two player to be involved in five tries in a single World Cup match in Fiji’s 45-10 win over Georgia.</p>
      <p>He has scored five tries in 10 international Tests since making his Fiji debut last year.</p>
