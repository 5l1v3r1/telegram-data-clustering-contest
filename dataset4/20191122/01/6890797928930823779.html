      <p>The destruction of Australia’s once famed quality of life continues with Sydney’s schools fast <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sydney-schools-running-out-of-play-space-20191120-p53ci4.html?fbclid=IwAR3Vks3b4XGshcFxNAYzyEc-gMF3G8jXovy9csgcMXVxAvebKRiDfKFoYyg">running out of play space</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Department of Education figures show 43 of the state’s 2200 schools have less than the required 10sqm of play space per student, although most were built decades ago in densely-populated inner city areas where land is at a premium.<br/><br/>Parramatta High is facing the biggest squeeze, with 2.21sqm per student, Cammeraygal High in Crows Nest is second with 2.95sqm, despite being the only school on the list that was opened after the space requirements were introduced in 2016…<br/><br/>Of the 31 primary schools on the list, Chatswood Public School has the least play space. The rapidly growing school has had its numbers increase by more than 50 per cent since 2012 and last year enrolments reached almost 1300…<br/><br/>The school has moved years three and four to a “bush campus” on the high school site, holds four separate assemblies, staggers lunch times and has banned ball games before school to deal with overcrowding.</blockquote>
      <p>Children shifting from high rise schools to high rise dog box homes. That’s Sydney’s future right there as its population roughly doubles to a projected 9.6 million by 2066:</p>

      <p>Oh well, at least if the kids aren’t running around playing they’ll drink less water, which is also in short supply.</p>
