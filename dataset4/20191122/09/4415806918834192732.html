      <p>Some British TSB customers have been left without wages in their accounts after the high street lender failed to process a number of overnight payments.</p>
      <p>The bank said a “small number” of customers failed to receive payments due in today, and it has been forced to offer emergency cash to those affected.</p>
      <p>TSB gave assurances that the delayed payments are expected to show up in accounts this afternoon.</p>
      <p>It said customers needing emergency cash can contact the bank, by going into branches or by phone.</p>
      <p>It marks the latest glitch to affect TSB, after a major IT meltdown last year left nearly two million people locked out of their accounts.</p>
      <blockquote>We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket</blockquote>
      <p>A TSB spokesman said: “Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today.</p>
      <p>“We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket.”</p>
      <p>It added that customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash.</p>
