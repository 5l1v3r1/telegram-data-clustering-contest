      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> was left fuming when she tried on a Versace dress that didn’t quite fit – but still decided to bless us with a picture of it anyway.</p>
      <p>And we lowkey love her for it.</p>
      <p>In a photo shared with her 152million followers, the 39-year-old could be seen posing in a floor-length, deep pink, sparkly gown, with clothes strewn all over the floor.</p>
      <p>A (sort of) relatable queen.</p>
      <p>‘How good would this @versace dress have been if it fit,’ the mum-of-four captioned the upload, alongside a crying emoji.</p>
      <p>But, judging by the unimpressed look on her face, she might want to swap that crying emoji for an angry one…</p>
      <p>Even though the dress didn’t fit, Kanye West’s wife still looked incredible in it – and fans flooded to praise the upload.</p>

      <p>‘WOW VERSACE NEVER LOOKED BETTERRRR,’ an Instagram user screamed.</p>

      <p>‘Kim you look amazing,’ a follower replied.</p>
      <p>‘It looks amazing as is,’ one posted. ‘I thought the middle part was designed that way.’</p>
      <p>While many, many more suggested she send the dress over to them instead, as they could make it fit…</p>

      <p>Kim recently made headlines after opening up about gaining 18 pounds over the last year, explaining how hard she was working to get in shape to reach her ‘goal weight’.</p>
      <p>In a video shared on her Instagram story, the reality star could be seen taking on an evening workout with personal trainer Melissa Alcantara before dinner.</p>
      <p>‘Okay, so we’re doing a night workout before my dinner, which I never do, with this one, but I figured we have to get into it at some point,’ she told fans.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you fall off and sometimes you’ve really got to get it together and this is one of my fallen off times where I am, I think, 18 pounds up from what I was about a year ago, a year and a half ago.’</p>
      <p>Speaking about turning 40, she revealed that she just wants to ‘feel good’ and has a goal weight in mind.</p>
      <p>‘I just want to get it like, a really good goal weight and so that means working out at all costs,’ she added.</p>
