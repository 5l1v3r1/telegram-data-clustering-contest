      <p>A <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/same-sex-0">same-sex</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Penguin">penguin</a> couple is attempting to incubate an egg after stealing it from another breeding pair.</p>
      <p>The male African <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/penguins">penguins</a>, who are housed in DierenPark Amersfoort <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/zoo">zoo</a> in the Netherlands, took the egg when the other penguins weren’t looking, <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/11/gay-penguins-at-amersfoort-zoo-steal-egg-and-and-try-to-hatch-it/"><i>Dutch News</i></a> reports.</p>
      <p>According to zookeeper Marc Belt, the couple is looking after the egg “very well” and taking it in turns to keep it warm.</p>
      <p>“Homosexuality is fairly common in penguins, but what makes this couple remarkable is that they have gotten hold of an egg,” Mr Belt said.</p>
      <p>The zoo stated that the couple whose egg was taken have already produced another one.</p>

      <p>African penguins have an extended breeding season, the South African National Biodiversity Institute <a href="https://www.sanbi.org/animal-of-the-week/african-penguin/">explains</a>.</p>
      <p>In Namibia, the breeding season of the species of penguin peaks from November to December, while in South Africa it peaks from March to May.</p>
      <p>While it is currently hatching season for the penguins, it has not been confirmed whether the egg taken by the same-sex penguin pair has been fertilised.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a same-sex penguin couple at Sea Life London <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gay-penguins-chick-adopted-same-sex-london-marama-rocky-a8985711.html">welcomed their first adopted chick</a>.</p>
      <p>The female gentoo penguin couple have been together for five years and were chosen to adopt an egg by the aquarium’s team after demonstrating they would make good parents.</p>
      <p>The aquarium said the egg was taken from its birth mother in order to relieve her from the pressure of raising two chicks.</p>
