      <p>Mabel stunned as she left an intimate gig in London, smouldering at the cameras like no one’s business.</p>
      <p>What a queen.</p>
      <p>The Don’t Call Me Up singer rocked a green leopard print bodysuit, pairing it with a glitzy belt and trousers and posing for the cameras as she left.</p>
      <p>Sharing a clip on Instagram, she put the look down to her ‘glam squad’, thanking them for ‘making me look like I got my shiiiii together.’</p>
      <p>Can we get in on that please?</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old, who’s just released her new track Loneliest Time Of The Year, previously opened up to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/04/wanting-show-true-authentic-self-made-mabel-stop-ashamed-anxiety-10686381/">Metro.co.uk about her anxiety – and how she learned to stop hating it.</a></p>
      <p>‘You can’t really hide when you’re doing what I do,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘I thought you can’t have those days and it was this constant turmoil of not being my full authentic self, because that side of me, that vulnerable part, it doesn’t make me weak.’</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old, who went from independently releasing Know Me Better on Soundcloud in 2015 to selling out arenas within a few short years, had her down days where she found it difficult to pretend to be the ‘sexy and cute’ pop sensation she thought she should be.</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘I was like “That can’t be a part of this” because I’m trying to flip my hair and be that perfect popstar and then realised actually it doesn’t make me weak or less strong.’</p>
      <p>Preach, girl.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/30/mabel-doesnt-consider-herself-to-be-a-role-model-8090713/">she definitely wouldn’t class herself as a role model</a>, explaining: ‘I think role model is a lot of pressure. I definitely want to send out a good message and be open and talk about those things (mental health).</p>
      <p>‘If I start talking about them, then other people will too. I don’t know about role model though.’</p>
