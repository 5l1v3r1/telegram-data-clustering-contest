      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:44:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of TSB customers have woken up without their wages and other payments, after technical problems rocked the bank.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/tsb-confirmed-replacing-yankee-candle-16832540">The bank</a> said payments into some accounts have been delayed and staff are investigating.</p>
      <p>Thousands of customers are thought to be affected, with wages, benefits, pensions and other payments not paid - <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/tsb-banking-money-problems-account-3565589">reports Hull Live.</a></p>
      <p>A spokeswoman <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/i-keep-having-ring-people-14707107">for TSB</a> said: "Some  payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket.</p>
      <p>"If TSB customers need emergency cash or have any questions they can visit us in branch or contact us via the number on the back of their card.</p>
      <p>"Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash."</p>
      <p>One customer said: "We're all waking up to discover we have no money - wages and benefits alike, not been paid in, all from different companies."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I’ve just had my 75-year-old dad on the phone worried sick saying his pension hasn’t gone into his account this morning.</p>
      <p>"What is going on and when will it be rectified?"</p>
      <p>It is not the first time TSB has experienced <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/barclays-online-banking-down-leaving-15177965">technical problems,</a> with a plague of IT failures back in April 2018.</p>
      <p>Just this week, an independent report accused the bank’s board of lacking “common sense” in the run up to the problems - which left 1.9 million customers unable to bank online, including some for several weeks.</p>
