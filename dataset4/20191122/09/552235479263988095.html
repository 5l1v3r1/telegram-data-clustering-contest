      <p>A Balloch man’s stunning shot of deer in Glencoe has proved a smash hit in an online photography competition.</p>
      <p>Ross MacFarlane, a greenkeeper at The Carrick, managed to snap the cheeky deer with its tongue out on a visit earlier this year, and entered it in a competition ran by the Kingshouse Hotel - with more than 3000 people picking Ross’s work as their favourite from hundreds of entries.</p>
      <p>And its popularity has come as a surprise to Ross - who didn’t really at the time how special the shot was.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He told the Lennox Herald: “I just took it on my iPhone, so I reckon it was just a lucky shot if I’m being honest.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t until I got home that I noticed and thought that it wasn’t a bad shot.</p>
      <p>“It’s been getting shared all over the place, so I’m happy with that and a few folk have even got in touch asking to buy canvas prints of it or whatever - so I’ll see about that once things have calmed down after Christmas and stuff.”</p>

      <p>Ross only took up photography as a way of escaping the stresses of everyday life, and the picture isn’t the only reason why Glencoe has a special place in his heart.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He continued: “We go to Glencoe every February because that’s where me and my fiance, Dorothy, got engaged, and that’s where we got it.</p>
      <p>“I entered the competition because Glencoe is a really special place for both of us and I thought it might be nice to get a wee break at this time of year, especially before Christmas and then getting everything sorted for the wedding.”</p>
