        <b>- The ex-Aston Villa forward says the welfare package offered by the country's FA will continue to scare the foreign-based players from playing for their motherland</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former England striker John Fashanu believes the Nigeria Football Federation will continue to find it difficult to convince some foreign-based players to play for the country.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old insisted the welfare package of England's FA is a major reason for their choice of consideration when considering which team to play for.</p>
      <p>Fashanu made just two appearances for the Three Lions but the ex-English football star reveals he still gets about N5 million every month in pension for the services he rendered three decades ago.</p>

      <p>Recently, the NFF failed to get Chelsea duo of Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori, as they pledged their allegiance to England.</p>

      <p>Before now, the country's football administrators had also tried poaching Jordan Ibe and Dele Alli but all four turned down an opportunity to wear the green and white jersey.</p>
      <p>Fashanu, however, told Daily Trust that: "<i>Till today, I still get my benefits, my pensions. I get N5m monthly as pensions for being an ex-footballer in England and I am now in my 50s</i>.</p>
      <p>"<i>Tammy knows why he hasn’t played for the Super Eagles and it’s because there is more financial benefits playing for England, there is more glory and less wahala</i>.</p>
      <p>"<i>Why do we ask the boy to play for Nigeria and torture him? We need to step up. Tammy is a massive miss for Nigeria</i>.</p>
