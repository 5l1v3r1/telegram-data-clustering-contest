      <p>Teki is in need of some human help.</p>
      <p>The loveable <a href="https://spca.bc.ca/news/senior-dog-vernon/">senior dog </a>needs the public's help to cover medical costs.</p>
      <p>Teki had surgery to remove two painful lumps and has received treatment for a severe dental disease.</p>
      <p>At almost 13 years old, Teki arrived at the SPCA underweight, but has been slowly gaining weight and recovering her strength.</p>
      <p>“Teki loves people and gets along well with other dogs. She is a very laid-back girl who loves nothing more than to fall asleep on the couch in front of a warm fire,” said Chelsea Taylor, SPCA Vernon and District Branch manager.</p>
      <p>Her estimated cost of care is $1,690.</p>
      <p>“We need to raise funds for Teki and the many other senior animals that end up in shelters in their twilight years,” said Taylor. “Teki is such a sweetie and deserves an awesome retirement home.”</p>
      <p>Staff are hopeful that Teki will be able to spend the holidays in her new forever home and she is currently available for adoption.</p>
      <p>To help Teki and other animals in need, visit the branch at 4800 Haney Rd., call 250-549-7297 or <a href="http://visitspca.bc.ca/medicalemergency">click here.</a></p>
