      <p>On Thursday night, November 21, 2019, Tesla <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/teslas-stainless-steel-futuristic-cybertruck-has-arrived">unveiled their much-anticipated Cybtertruck</a>, and when the company's founder and CEO, Elon Musk, said those three little words "One more thing," no one knew what to expect. </p>
      <p>Surprising the audience, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain">Musk also unveiled</a> Tesla's all-electric All-Terrain Vehicle or ATV. The ATV perfectly matches and complements the Cybertruck's cyberpunk look, and even charges out of the back of the pickup. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>An unexpected, yet welcome, surprise</h3>
      <p>Just as Musk was about to walk off the stage, the sound of a moving vehicle could be heard. Then a jet-black <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain">ATV</a> rolled onto the stage, much to the audience's surprise and awe. </p>

      <p>The ATV driver easily navigated the vehicle onto the back of the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> pickup. It was a dual mission that displayed the newly-uncovered pickup truck's fantastic suspension and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/22/cybertruck-atv-tesla/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC9kYu5VF3phJ5iaLj99b8owObsK0ZDPRW3NEzEWzzXJP_cEV0ExMba4dguJzvc6T8r5CLERTK9mwV3uuc7O756DhvxxVYuYvGWMAJs9tEhyA2T3jJo6mLWw8LMGsSzT8rCpm323XA4tyNugLfOBNYZK0mPyWRbZUiYKrynq56FF"><b> six-and-a-half-foot-long</b></a> boot.</p>
      <p>To add the cherry on top of the cake, the driver then plugged the parked ATV into a charging socket above the truck's back tire. </p>

      <p>ATVs are usually used for off-road adventures or outdoor work. However, they're usually gas or petrol-guzzling machines, with very few of them powered by electricity.</p>
      <p>The only other fully electric ATV on the market at the moment is the <a href="https://www.drrelectricatv.com/">Stealth Electric ATV</a> that uses a <b>4 kW</b> motor to support <b>72 volts</b> of power. This roughly gives the ATV a <b>35-38 mile</b> (approximately 55-60 km) range and speeds of up to<b> 35 mph </b>(55 kmh).</p>

      <p>Given the Cybertruck's usefulness for outdoor and off-road settings, the ATV will marvelously complement it. Moreover, the ability to charge the ATV directly from the truck will provide an easier ride for the owners, who will no longer need to drag along liters of gas or petrol with them. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/cybertruck">Tesla</a> is certainly targeting the outdoor market with its two new vehicle additions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-surprises-with-all-electric-atv-at-the-end-of-cybertruck-event/">We'll have to wait</a> to find out the price, battery capacity, top speed, and range of the ATV, as Tesla has yet to share the information publicly. </p>
