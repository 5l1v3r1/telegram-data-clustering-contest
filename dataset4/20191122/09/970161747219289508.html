      <p>Elton John may have one of the most impressive careers in the world, but he’s admitted it’s mentoring young artists that ‘keeps him alive’.</p>
      <p>So sweet!</p>
      <p>The legendary musician said it’s stars like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a>, Lorde, and Sam Fender that always catch his attention.</p>
      <p>‘I do a radio show each week and that keeps me in touch with the younger generation and new artists… When I hear someone like Sam Fender and I think he’s amazing,’ he said on Lorraine.</p>

      <p>‘Or Billie Eilish who was 16 when she made her record, or Lorde… that’s incredible. When you hear someone new who is just starting out, it moves you.</p>
      <p>‘I always try and make an effort of contacting those kids and having lunch with them and saying, “If you need any advice, I’ve been around since Julius Caesar, please give me a ring, here’s my email, it’s difficult sometimes”.</p>
      <p>‘That keeps me alive. The young give you so much energy.’</p>
      <p>However, his pal David Walliams wasn’t about to let the sincere moment pass, quipping: ‘Thank you.’</p>

      <p>Elton’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/02/elton-john-calls-billie-eilish-one-talented-young-ladies-ive-ever-heard-10101030/">no stranger to the young stars of today, previously dubbing Billie</a> ‘one of the most talented young ladies I’ve ever heard’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Complex’s Pigeons and Planes, Elton said he was a big fan of Khalid, Collard, Loyle Carner, Dave, Slowthai, Little Simz, Ray BLK and MoStack – yep, Elton has his finger on the pulse – before singing Billie’s praises.</p>
      <p>He said of the 17-year-old: ‘She is one for the most talented young ladies I’ve ever heard. Her album was amazing. She’s come a long way very quickly. She’s an incredible word of mouth artist. All the tracks we’ve played have been so different, and that’s what I love about her. There’s is no box to put you in.</p>

      <p>‘There are no rules. I can’t wait to see her live because she has something very special going on. Talent like hers doesn’t come along very often.’</p>

      <p>And it’s no secret<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/lana-del-rey-proves-you-can-interview-your-bestie-as-she-gets-inside-scoops-from-elton-john-10978748/"> that Elton and Lana Del Rey are pretty obsessed with each other</a>, with the Video Games singer interviewing her hero for Rolling Stone.</p>
      <p>Chatting about Billie and Kacey Musgraves, he said: ‘I mean, the girls are leading the way. They’re writing about their life. That’s what moves me. There are very few male singers that move me.</p>
      <p>‘Sam Fender is my top pick for the guys.’</p>
