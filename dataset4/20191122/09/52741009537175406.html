      <p>TORONTO — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Ottawa today.</p>
      <p>The sit-down between the pair will be the latest in a series of in-person talks Trudeau is having with provincial leaders after receiving a minority mandate last month.</p>
      <p>Trudeau frequently warned voters during the federal election against Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer by trying to tie him to Ford, whose popularity has been sinking in recent polls.</p>
      <p>Ford said Thursday that he will bring a collaborative message to the meeting, despite the frequent attacks the prime minister launched against him during the federal election campaign.</p>
      <p>Ford says he is eager to work with the federal government on a number of files including health care and public transit.</p>
      <p>Trudeau has already met with leaders including Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 22, 2019.</p>
