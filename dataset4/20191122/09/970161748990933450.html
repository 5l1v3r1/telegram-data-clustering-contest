        <b>Coronation Street star Maureen Lipman has launched a blistering attack on the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn in a bizarre video for Mainstream which recreates her TV advert character Beattie. In the video, she claims to have been a lifelong Labour party but brands the party ‘extremists, not sociliasts’ before urging viewers not to vote for the party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maureen, who plays battleaxe Evelyn Plummer in the soap, is in character as Beattie from the BT Adverts she used to star in and is seen on the phone speaking to Nora. She makes her feelings pretty clear about the Labour Party and goes on to make points about broadband and anti-semitism.</p>

      <p>Despite claiming to have been a lifelong Labour supporter in the video, Maureen previously spoke out about <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/maureen-lipman-says-she-cant-vote-labour-while-ed-miliband-is-leader-9827294.html">being unable to support the party under its leader Ed Miliband too back in 2014.</a></p>
      <p>In her most recent video, she says: ‘They’re not socialists, you know what they are, Nora? They’re extremists.’ She also accuses the party of ‘bullying, hectoring and driving out of good Jewish Labour MPs.’</p>

      <p>Speaking of Jeremy Corbyn directly, she said that he planned to get his ‘allotment hands on my broadband’ adding: ‘It’s taken me ten years Nora to learn how to Skype my grandchildren. I can do the shopping online, the dry goods, I can do the banking online so I don’t have to walk four miles to a bank that’s not even there and he wants to take it away and ruin it – a man who thinks you get out of Brexit with a revolving door.’</p>
      <p>She concluded the video with the statement: ‘My mother always said, “this is a kind and a decent country. They will always do the decent thing. Well if that’s the case, why would anybody vote for this Labour Party?’</p>
      <p>She performed the entire video in character as Beattie <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10397410/maureen-lipman-attack-corbyn/">but explained to The Sun why she made it</a>, commenting: ‘Like many socialists, I am at a loss. Nobody, I feel should vote for a party which is driven by Marxist theory, by bullying and exclusion, by scant fiscal knowledge and by a visceral disregard for traditions we hold most dear. How best to express that was my problem.</p>

      <p>‘It was only when big spender Corbyn announced that he would take control of broadband that I began to wonder what Beattie, newly liberated by computer literacy, would make of handing over that freedom to a bunch of profligate people with scant regard for her centrist sensibilities.’</p>
