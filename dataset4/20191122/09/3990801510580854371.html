      <p>Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Jane Didion used to say: There’s only one way to go from here!</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price</h3>
      <p>We closed the day, November 21 2019, at a price of $7,642. That’s a notable 4.74 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$380.89. It was the lowest closing price in twenty-seven days.</p>

      <p>Yesterday’s volume of $22,514,243,371 was the highest in twelve days, 39 percent above the year’s average, and 50 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 477 tons of gold.</p>

      <p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 94.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $140,761 by now, according to dickline.info.</p>
