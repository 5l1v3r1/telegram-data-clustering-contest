      <h1>Greta Thunberg has a 19th-century doppelganger</h1>
      <h2>Naturally, everyone thinks she's a time traveler</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:35:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Scottie Andrew, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - When 16-year-old environment activist <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/02/world/greta-thunberg-leonardo-dicaprio-trnd/index.html">Greta Thunberg</a> isn't busy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/23/weather/greta-thunberg-unga-climate-speech-intl/index.html">challenging global leaders</a> to reduce their carbon footprint or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/world/global-climate-strike-teenagers-school-walkout-greta-thunberg-intl/index.html">mobilizing young people</a> to strike for the climate, she's...time traveling?</p>
      <p>That's the consensus on social media, at least. Savvy users dug up a 19th-century photo of a girl who looks eerily similar to the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/world/greta-thunberg-nordic-award-decline-trnd/index.html">21st-century teen</a>.</p>
      <p>"120-year-old photo sparks theories that climate activist &amp; environmental heroine, @GretaThunberg , is, in fact, a 'time-travel' who has traveled thru time to save our planet! Wishing her all the best and success in her mission to save the Earth. We can use the help we can get!" <a href="https://twitter.com/DeanFriedman/status/1197329499144232960">one person wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>"It is safe to say that @GretaThunberg must have used a solor-powered time machine to time travel," <a href="https://twitter.com/das_varun99/status/1197134739712307200">joked another</a>.</p>
      <p>A third user floated a much bleaker theory: the photo is from the <a href="https://twitter.com/bucketofmoney/status/1196959858051780608">dystopian future</a>.</p>
      <p>Have a closer look:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/28/world/youth-environment-activists-greta-thunberg-trnd/index.html">Thunberg's doppelganger</a> is one of three children in the photo from 1898. Per the <a href="https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/hegg/id/601/">University of Washington Libraries'</a> digital archives, they're sifting for gold in the Canadian Yukon Territory.</p>
      <p>As if she would go anywhere near a <i>mine</i>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/world/greta-thunberg-right-livelihood-nobel-trnd/index.html">trailblazing teen </a>hasn't responded to the hubbub, as she's <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1197221196149989377">already set sail for Portugal</a> on her zero-emissions yacht. But she did share this black-and-white photo before the time-traveling theories commenced. Maybe she saw it coming.</p>
      <p>Or maybe she's just got one of those timeless faces.</p>
