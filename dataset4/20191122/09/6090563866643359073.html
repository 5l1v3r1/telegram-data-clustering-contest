      <p>G40 kingpin, Prof Jonathan Moyo, says the Commander of One Presidential Guard Infantry Battalion at State House, Lt Col Samson Murombo has been suspended from duty following a shooting incident at State House earlier this week.</p>
      <p>A young Zimbabwean soldier reportedly fired shots into the air whilst on guard duty at State House, complaining of “hunger” and was promptly taken into custody over the incident. He was subsequently tortured and later taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>Writing on microblogging site Twitter on Friday, Moyo said:</p>
      <blockquote>Meanwhile, the Commander of One Presidential Guard Infantry Battalion at State House, Lt Col Samson Murombo, has been suspended from duty over the State House shooting incident, for which he’s being blamed. He’s been replaced by Col Chicha. Murombo is of the Auxillia audio fame!</blockquote>
