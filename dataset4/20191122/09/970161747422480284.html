      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">Big Bang Theory</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glee/">Glee</a> actress Jane Galloway Heitz has died, aged 78.</p>
      <p>The star would be recognised by fans as playing the founder of the William McKinley Glee Club Lillian Adler in the musical comedy, and also appeared in the hit science-sitcom as the character Mildred.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jane-galloway-heitz-dead-glee-actress-was-78-1256689">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the 78-year-old died from congestive heart failure at a hospital in Illinois.</p>
      <p>As a casting agent, she helped launch the careers of chat show host Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell and Modern Family star Eric Stonestreet, who paid tribute to his former mentor with a touching post on social media.</p>

      <p>‘Jane was the first casting director to ever call me in for an audition,’ he wrote. ‘She became a great friend and mentor.</p>
      <p>‘She put me on the path I’m on. I wish I could have said thank you one more time.’</p>
      <p>Jane was a widower to husband Bill and is survived by her daughter Amie and three grandchildren</p>
      <p>Prior to her career as an actress, she worked as a casting agent, even founding her own casting business before jumping in front of the camera herself.</p>

      <p>Jane’s most famous role was that of teacher Ms. Adler in Glee, whose leadership of the Glee Club inspired Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to continue her legacy with the New Directions.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show will recognise Jane from a plaque paying tribute to her character, which appeared throughout the entire run of the show.</p>
      <p>It was even in the last shot of the finale, shown alongside a similar one for Cory Monteith’s character, Finn Hudson. The inscription of plaque became something of a mantra for the show itself:</p>
      <p>‘By its very definition, Glee is about opening yourself up to joy.’</p>
