      <p>Thousands of TSB customers claim they haven't been paid after the bank's app crashed.</p>
      <p>Frustrated customers have taken to social media to vent their anger at the bank.</p>
      <p>Many customers claim they are unable to access their mobile banking app or online account, reporting that the app ‘crashes’ as they attempt to check their balances.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">Downtetector</a> , many people across the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">North East</a> have reported issues with their payments.</p>
      <p>One customer said: "I need my wages to pay my rent and bills please, not emergency cash."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "TSB are playing with me today! Firstly my pay hasn't gone through.</p>
      <p>"Secondly they had the cheek to send a 'You are nearing your credit...' text.</p>
      <p>"Thirdly, I have been on hold for about 20 mins and then cut off. TWICE."</p>

      <p>One customer said: "Extremely annoying! I wanted to use money, my wages, to buy some presale concert tickets today that go on sale at 10am.</p>
      <p>"They'll be gone quickly and now I won't have the funds to try unless it's cleared by then. If not I'll have no chance! Cheers TSB"</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">TSB</a> confirmed there has been an error in processing payments overnight, and they are working to fix the issues.</p>
      <p>A TSB spokesman said: "We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues this morning.</p>
      <p>"We are currently investigating the cause and apologise for any inconvenience caused."</p>
      <p>The bank has confirmed that customers can still operate their personal cards at this time to make payments or withdraw cash.</p>
      <p>A spokesman added: "If TSB customers need emergency cash or have any questions they can visit us in branch or contact us via the number on the back of their card. Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash.”</p>
