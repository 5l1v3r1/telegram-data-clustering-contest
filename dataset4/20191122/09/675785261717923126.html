      <h1>Fulham are lethal going forward but unless they tighten up they won't gain promotion</h1>
      <h2>In this week's EFL on Quest column - pundit Ian Holloway has his say on Fulham's playing style, Leeds' lack of options and Premier League clubs in waiting</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Holloway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ian-holloway/</a></address>
      <p>I like Fulham going forward, I just felt they let too many goals in last year and that can be damaging to the group when you can't keep clean sheets.</p>
      <p>I think Scott Parker is a wonderful fella, I really like him and he's cutting his teeth in management and there's no doubt he has got the right character to shine through.</p>
      <p>It is just that balance - have they sorted out those holes in defence? It was their style they went from being open and out playing you by being over attacking and at times they tried doing that in the Premier League and they got burnt.</p>
      <p>Can he make them not quite so open, not so attacking and have enough in defence to stop leaking goals. It is all about having the base to do something.</p>
      <p>If you can't defend properly or if you are an attacking team and you're not defending behind your last attack you'll get done on the counter attack. That is quite a big problem to have.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> won the Premier League title brilliantly a few years ago by counter attacking against the best, having a lot less possession but still stinging them and beating them.</p>

      <p>That is the transition he's trying to go through because they are very attack minded.</p>
      <p>They've got probably the best striker in Aleksandar MitroviÄ‡ I would suggest.</p>
      <p>I love him - an old fashioned number 9. When they signed him they went to the next level.</p>
      <p>But they lost Ryan Fredericks who was a huge part of their success. They lost Ryan Sessegnon who was a huge part of their success.</p>

      <p>So that is like having to rebuild isn't it? But attacking wise I do like their options and they could come into it but for me it is all about January.</p>
      <p>It is all about when this window opens, who can add the best. And when they signed Mitrovic it was the best signing of the window and it got them the biggest reward with promotion.</p>

      <h3>Leeds have the same problems as last year - can they last the course</h3>
      <p>I still think they've got the same issues. Eddie Nketiah is really young, but I do like him, and Patrick Bamford is Patrick Bamford.</p>
      <p>Can he get the amount of goals they are going to need? At the moment they are sharing them around which is good.</p>
      <p>I really like their manager. I do think he is very different and he's been ahead of his time for years.</p>
      <p>I like the way he's targeted Leeds with that huge crowd. I like the way he stayed after not doing it last year.</p>
      <p>But unless he gets a bigger squad I do fear that they might fall away again.</p>
      <p>I hope they don't because they could really grace that top flight, but they've got to earn the right.</p>
      <p>They got so close and couldn't do it last year but the same question mark is hanging over them - have they got the strength in depth to actually go and do it this time?</p>

      <h3>Middlesbrough are boom and bust in the market - they'll come again</h3>
      <p>Middlesbrough have had little periods where they go for it. Its like they have a spending spree and hope it works.</p>
      <p>It must be how their owner's businesses work but they've been well supported and really well funded and they will come again.</p>
      <p>It just can't be as quick as some of the fans want which is the problem.</p>
      <p>I think in the recent windows they've lost Patrick Bamford and Adama Traore. To be fair if you signed those two for Middlesbrough wouldn't they be in a much better position.</p>
      <p>If you look at the potential Traore's got it is incredible. But at times they do need to recoup because unfortunately if you don't get success quick enough you do come into a bit of financial trouble.</p>

      <h3>Bristol poised for the top flight - but how many others think the same</h3>
      <p>Bristol are building gradually. They did want a different arena but that went wrong so he's (Steve Lansdowne) rebuilt Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>And it is a credit to him, I do think he's created a carnival atmosphere on the outside of it with the bands and what have you.</p>
      <p>He's done very very well getting the rugby involved as well so it is on the up. It is a ready and waiting Premier League outfit, but how many more could you say that about?</p>
      <p>You've got Middlesbrough, you've got Derby County. There are some massive clubs around like Leeds.</p>
      <p>They will all claim 'we should go up this year'.</p>
