      <p>French Montana has been hospitalised in Los Angeles after suffering scary cardiac issues, intense nausea, and getting an unexpected visit from cops to his home, TMZ reports.</p>
      <p>French was rushed to a hospital by ambulance on Thursday around 1:30 PM but it was cops who made the call to get him treatment. According to law enforcement sources, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies were called to his Calabasas home for a possible robbery.</p>
      <p>This turned out to be a false alarm, but the responding deputies determined French was acting abnormal, it was discovered that he had been suffering severe stomach pains, nausea and perhaps most alarmingly, an elevated heart rate.</p>
      <p>French was taken to a San Fernando Valley hospital. He is awake and alert right now. He is also getting treatment that includes IV fluids and is expected to be released later today.</p>
      <p>French has been traveling a lot over the last couple of weeks including trips to the Middle East and Europe and it is possible that he could have been exposed to contaminated food.</p>
