      <h1>Review: Uncle Frank at The Full Moon</h1>
      <h2>A good reggae performance for a small Bristolian crowd from a band featuring Frank Benbink from the Fun Lovin' Criminals</h2>

      <p>Frank Benbini is probably most well-known as the drummer from alternative rock group Fun Lovin' Criminals.</p>
      <p>However, alongside this, he's also part of the multi-instrumental band, Uncle Frank, which he formed alongside fellow band member Naim Cortazzi in 2004.</p>
      <p>Since 2004, Uncle Frank have released three albums, Step Into My Room (2014), Love Lion (2017) and their most recent Soul On The Battleground (2019).</p>
      <p>The band have recently been graced with national radio play from the likes of BBC6 Music and BBC Radio 2 and A-listed on Regional Radio throughout the UK.</p>
      <p>Having read these reviews I was keen to go down to Full Moon where Uncle Frank did the gig to interview Frank Benbini himself and check out what an Uncle Frank show is like.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Frank Benbini himself</b>
      </p>
      <p>I arrived at the Full Moon at 8pm ready to interview Frank. My first impressions of the venue were that it had a mix of old pub style with a contemporary, young and hip atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The outside looked very pristine on a chilly winter's evening.</p>

      <p>I was guided to a room by a helpful receptionist where Uncle Frank were practising and doing sound checks for the upcoming show.</p>
      <p>Frank took me to a room behind the venue where we sat down on some comfy sofas and talked about his journey down to Bristol from Leicester. I started by asking how he felt about the upcoming gig and the musical genre Uncle Frank like to define themselves by.</p>
      <p>"I always like playing Bristol, I've been playing Bristol for over twenty years...obviously our music isn't completely conformed or rammed down your mouth commercially, they're probably here for something left of field and that suits us just fine.</p>
      <p>"We have such a varied eclectic taste from jazz to classical to musicals even, with a massive slice of rock n roll, hip hop and funk."</p>
      <p>I was especially interested about what Frank thought about the amazing music scene Bristol offers to people.</p>
      <p>He said: "There's a massive music heritage when it comes to Bristol, whether it's your drum and bass or electronic music and you've got great universities down here. It's got a lot of style, such an eclectic mix of youth.</p>
      <p>"What I do like about Bristol though is you've got the hip crowd and also the older crowd and it's like everyone's accepted, that's what I love about Bristol, there's no snobbery."</p>
      <p>Frank himself has opened up in the past about the effects the music industry has had on his anxiety and battles with depression. So I was interested in finding out how making music helps him overcome these obstacles.</p>
      <p>"The way it helps is it acts as a diversion, it keeps me busy, it diverts me from them lonely corners in your mind."</p>
      <p>Uncle Frank will also be doing a small tour around the UK next year during January and February 2020.</p>
      <p>"It's only a short run, we're just doing five dates and we're doing a couple of acoustic sessions and then it will be festival season.</p>
      <p>"We're unapologetically Uncle Frank, if you like us great, if you don't like us great, we hope people come down to our other gig at Thekla on January 30th."</p>
      <p>My last crucial question was what the Bristolian audience could look forward to during the show.</p>
      <p>"You'll get varied, you'll get a bit of reggae, you'll get a little bit of rock n roll, you'll get a bit of Uncle Frank. I like to think you'll get a mixture of it all."</p>
      <p>And with that in mind I was looking forward to the night ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The review itself</b>
      </p>
      <p>Uncle Frank weren't on until 11:30pm, so I decided to invite some of my housemates, Lucy and Shameera to experience the gig as well.</p>
      <p>Upon entering The Attic bar, which is the music venue across from the Full Moon bar, we were immediately struck by how cold the venue was.</p>
      <p>However, this was because not everyone had arrived for the show yet, a few keen people were eagerly at the front anticipating the beginning of the set.</p>

      <p>After a ten-minute wait, Uncle Frank took to the stage and graced the audience with their first song.</p>
      <p>As the first song commenced, the crowd started slowly drawing in as they heard the mix of world and chill beats which made for an interesting instrumental beginning.</p>
      <p>There were no lyrics during the first song, but the keen crowd seemed to enjoy it.</p>
      <p>As the first song draws to a close, Mike asks the crowd, "Is Bristol in the house tonight?", to which one enthusiastic girl screams very loudly, displaying her evident enthusiasm for the band.</p>
      <p>A "woo" sound effect introduces most of the songs throughout the gig. Whilst I understand why this sound transition may have been necessary, it was slightly overplayed.</p>
      <p>"Step Into My Room" was the second song played, followed by the third song which had a reggae/hip hop vibe.</p>
      <p>Frank introduced this song by saying, "I find this music is better if you close your eyes, you drift off to another place." The audience willfully obeyed.</p>

      <p>The third song certainly had a chilled vibe to it, so much so that it actually made me a bit sleepy. The reggae vibe had everyone chilled in the venue</p>
      <p>Halfway through, Frank calls out to the crowd: "There's only a few of you, but let's make it worth it."</p>
      <p>During this part of the performance, I noticed a transition from reggae to rock. Whilst this may seem like an odd transition, it worked fairly well and the crowd seemed to appreciate this.</p>
      <p>Near the end, it was full on reggae again. During the song "Doves Cry," the crowd enjoyed the reggae beats that were echoing across the room.</p>
      <p>After this song Frank shouts, "You want some reggae, it's your night." The crowd screamed back. They wanted reggae.</p>
      <p>There was a good solo on the drums near the end with a rap ending mixing things up a bit.</p>
      <p>Overall this was a good reggae performance for a small Bristolian crowd.</p>
