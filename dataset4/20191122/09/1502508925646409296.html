      <h1>More curbs on H1-B &amp; L-1 visas likely as US Homeland seeks to tweak norms</h1>
      <h2>The changes may see the introduction of additional requirements to ensure employers pay appropriate wages to H-1B visa holders</h2>

      <p>To protect the interests of American workers, US may soon put further curbs on H1-B and L-1 work visas.</p>
      <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proposing to revise the definition of specialty occupation to “increase focus on obtaining the best and the brightest foreign nationals via the H1-B program,” a news report in The Economic Times said.</p>
      <p>The changes may see the introduction of additional requirements to ensure employers pay appropriate wages to H1-B visa holders.</p>
      <p>The changes have been proposed under the Fall 2019 Unified Agenda that provides a roadmap of planned federal rule-making across agencies.</p>
      <p>A similar set of changes has also been proposed for L-1 visas, used in intra-company transfers. In addition, the DHS has suggested that the ban on the work authorization for spouses of H1-B visa holders should be implemented by March next year.</p>
      <p>"The purpose of these changes is to ensure that H1-B visas are awarded only to individuals who will be working in a job which meets the statutory definition of specialty occupation,” the DHS said. “In addition, these changes are intended to ensure that the H1-B programme supplements the US workforce and strengthens US worker protections."</p>
      <p>DHS has proposed a target of December 2019 and September 2020 respectively to publish the rule for the H1-B and L-1 visa changes.</p>
