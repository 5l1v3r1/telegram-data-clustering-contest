      <h1>Oxford Dictionaries Declares 'Climate Emergency' the Word of 2019</h1>

      <p>Oxford Dictionaries has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/oxford-dictionaries-declares-climate-emergency-the-word-of-2019">declared "climate emergency" the word of the year for 2019</a>, following a hundred-fold increase in usage that it says demonstrated a "greater immediacy" in the way we talk about the climate. From a report:<i> Defined as "a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it," Oxford said the words soared from "relative obscurity" to "one of the most prominent -- and prominently debated -- terms of 2019." According to the dictionary's data, usage of "climate emergency" soared 10,796%. Oxford said the choice was reflective, not just of the rise in climate awareness, but the focus specifically on the language we use to discuss it. The rise of "climate emergency" reflected a conscious push towards language of immediacy and urgency, the dictionary said. In 2019, "climate" became the most common word associated with "emergency," three times more than "health emergency" in second.</i></p>
