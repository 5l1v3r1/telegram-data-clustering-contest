      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has told Tottenham players that they would always be in his heart following his <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/19/epl-tottenham-sack-manager-pochettino/">sack by the Premier League side</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoints-jose-mourinho-as-head-coach/">replaced by a former Manchester United coach Jose Mourinho</a> on Wednesday morning by the North London side.</p>
      <p>In a farewell message as shared by his assistant Jesus Perez, Pochettino wrote on a tactics board in the players’ dressing room:</p>
      <p>“Big thanks to you all.  We can’t say goodbye… you will always be in our hearts.”</p>
      <p>The pictures were posted on Perez’ Twitter account with the caption: “COYS.”</p>
