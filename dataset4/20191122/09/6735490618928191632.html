      <p>Today is the day that “Frozen” fans have been waiting for, with “Frozen 2” arriving in theatres.</p>
      <p>In honour of the big day, Josh Gad (a.k.a. Olaf the snowman) filled in for Ellen DeGeneres as guest host of her daytime talk show, and he welcomed co-star Idina Menzel (Elsa).</p>
      <p>During their chat, Menzel and Gad talk about her recent induction into the Hollywood Walk of Fame during a joint ceremony in which she and <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/543899/kristen-bell-explains-the-real-meaning-of-let-it-go-in-hilarious-hollywood-walk-of-fame-induction-speech/">“Frozen” co-star Kristen Bell</a> each got their own stars.</p>

      <p>The pair also reminisce about performing “Let It Go” at a gay bar in London with co-star Jonathan Groff, and then tell viewers about their duet on Menzel’s star-studded new holiday album, <i><a href="https://etcanada.com/news/514055/idina-menzel-announces-new-holiday-album-featuring-ariana-grande-billy-porter-more/">Christmas: A Season Of Love</a>.</i></p>
      <p>It’s during this part of the conversation that Gad resurrects one of DeGeneres’ funniest recurring bits when a show staffer, dressed in an Olaf costume, bursts out of a fake table next to Menzel to scare her right out of her chair.</p>
