      <p>Twitter now lets you hide the replies to your tweets<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>After the ability to schedule your tweets, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/twitter">Twitter</a> continues to roll out new features for its platform users. Tested for months, especially in Canada, the new feature to hide replies to a tweet is being rolled out to all users.</p>
      <p>The feature is available to all users, both on the web and on mobile apps, including Twitter Lite. The ability to hide replies to a tweet is intended to prevent conversations from slipping or taking a negative turn.</p>
      <h3>Twitter hidden replies, but always accessible</h3>

      <p>Hidden replies by the original tweet author do not appear at first, but users still have the option to display them by clicking a dedicated button on the original message.</p>
      <p>The social network has also provided some statistics concerning this function. We learn that 85% of users who already use it, no longer use the block or mute function.</p>
      <h3>Dual authentication without phone number</h3>

      <p>The platform also <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2019/more-control-over-your-conversations-globally.html">announced</a> that it has made some changes to the use of dual authentication to secure an account.</p>
      <p>“We’re also making it easier to secure your account with Two-Factor Authentication. Starting today, you can enroll in 2FA without a phone number”.</p>
      <p>Now users have the option to activate this additional security option without having to enter their number. And for those who already use this option with their mobile number, they can now go to the settings of their account to reconfigure without it.</p>
