      <h2>Dundee United have agreed a new deal with key midfielder Calum Butcher.</h2>

      <p>The 28-year-old Englishman rejoined the Tangerines for a second spell at the end of the last January window, initially signing an 18-month contract.</p>
      <p>His second stint has been so successful, though, that the Championship leaders have moved to replace that deal with a new, improved one.</p>
      <p>Butcher previously enjoyed two seasons at Tannadice before moving to Burton Albion in the summer of 2015, going on to also have spells at Millwall and Mansfield.</p>
      <p>Since returning, he has been one of United’s most important players and provided strength and skill both in the middle of the park and in central defence when required.</p>
      <p>Butcher further endeared himself to the Tangerines’ fans with two goals in the 6-2 derby win over city rivals Dundee at Tannadice back in August.</p>
