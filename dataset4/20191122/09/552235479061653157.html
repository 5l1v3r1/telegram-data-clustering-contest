      <p>Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas without a visit to see Santa, so head down to Castle Street to meet the man himself, listen to a magical story and receive a wee gift.</p>
      <p>Add to the fun with a ride on the Helter Skelter and then warm up with some delicious mulled wine or hot chocolate from the bar below. Santa will be on Castle St until Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>New for 2019 is Community Christmas. Edinburgh’s Christmas magic will be heading to twelve locations over twelve nights around Edinburgh, bringing a building to life in each locality for one night only with winter projections accompanied by local choirs performing some of their best-loved festive tunes for their local community.</p>
