        <b>Max Branning (Jake Wood) and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ruby-allen/">Ruby Allen</a> (Louisa Lytton) have only been dating a couple of months in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>, but Max is determined to hold on to his girlfriend, and thus he resolves to take their relationship to the next level by popping the big question — a task he undertakes during tonight’s episode.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Max has experienced a lot of heartache over the past couple of years — and this year has been one of his toughest yet, as he found himself going head-to-head with Rainie (Tanya Franks) over custody of baby Abi. Amid all of the devastation, however, he’s managed to find a little bit of happiness <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/09/eastenders-spoilers-shock-summer-affair-for-max-branning-and-ruby-allen-10139852/">in his relationship with Ruby</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Max’s journey over the last couple of months, actor Jake Wood told Metro.co.uk: ‘I think this last year — year and a half — has been about Max finding his feet really after everything he’s been through. You know, trying to get custody of Abi.’</p>

      <p>‘I think at the minute it feels like Max is getting settled and getting his feet on the ground, and getting back into normal life, if you like.’</p>

      <p>Last night, viewers saw Max become embarrassed when a punter in E20 attempted to buy Ruby a drink, as he’d <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/16/eastenders-spoilers-ruby-allens-shocking-new-love-interest-is-revealed-10122301/">assumed that Max was simply Ruby’s dad</a>.</p>
      <p>The conversation got Max thinking, and — after making light of the situation — Jack (Scott Maslen) suggested that Max needs to up his game if he wants to keep Ruby.</p>
      <p>Tonight, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/eastenders-spoilers-max-branning-proposes-to-ruby-allen-10961097/">he takes it upon himself to pop the question</a>, but how exactly does he come to this conclusion?</p>
      <p>Jake told us: ‘He thinks that the right thing to do is to propose. He’s not exactly sure what Ruby wants, but I’m not exactly sure he knows what he wants. I think he just wants to make a commitment to her.’</p>

      <p>‘He does it in the restaurant — in Walford East — and he enlists Bobby Beale to help him to make it spectacular and special’.</p>
      <p>Yes, determined to prove he’s serious about Ruby, he asks <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bobby-beale/">Bobby</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/clay-milner-russell/">Clay Milner Russell</a>) for help. However, Ian (Adam Woodyatt) eavesdrops on the conversation and wastes little time in winding Max up over what he’s heard.</p>
      <p>Viewers will have to wait until tonight to see what transpires — and to see what Ruby’s answer is — but with Ian set to get involved, it’s no doubt going to be unmissable!</p>
      <p>Yes or No? Now that <i>is</i> the question!</p>
