      <h1>In Mortal Kombat 11, Sindel's new fatality will make you scream</h1>
      <h2>Hair today, gone tomorrow.</h2>

      <p>Mortal Kombat 11 gets Sindel on Tuesday, 26th November as a DLC character, and developer NetherRealm has shown off her hair-raising new moves.</p>
      <p>In the video below, NetherRealm's Tyler Lansdown and Stephanie Brownback run through the Queen of Edenia's new moveset. In Mortal Kombat 11, Sindel is a mix-up character, whereas in Mortal Kombat 9 she was very much a zoning character. She incorporates her deadly hair into many of her moves, such as her throws, and her scream is back in various forms. Of note, her bladed staff from 2004's Mortal Kombat Deception is back (you can see it on her hip). This was last seen in 2006's Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and is used in Mortal Kombat 11 in a number of moves.</p>

      <p>Anyway, onto the good stuff. Sindel's fatalities lean heavily on her scream and hair. Here's fatality number one:</p>
      <p>That's a bit by the numbers for me. Things get really juicy with Sindel's fatality number two. Here, Sindel shoves her hair down her opponent's throat (ugg!), out of their body in all the wrong places, back in through the back of their head (pop-eye time) and then a big squeeze for maximum destruction. Yum.</p>

      <p>Sindel's second fatality instantly enters my top five favourite Mortal Kombat 11 fatalities, primarily because of the hair down the throat thing. It makes me wince every time I see it. There's something about choking on hair that rubs me up the wrong way. What a way to go.</p>

      <p>This beauty, from D'Vorah, remains my favourite Mortal Kombat 11 fatality, though. Yikes!</p>
