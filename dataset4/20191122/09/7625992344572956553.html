      <p>This recipe, by Manolya E. Oner of USDA-ARS Pacific basin Agricultural Research Center, Hilo, appears in the book <a href="https://www.hawaiihomegrown.net/breadfruit-publications/breadfruit-cookbook">"Ho'oulu ka 'Ulu Cookbook: Breadfruit Tips, Techniques, and Hawai'i's Favorite Home Recipes,"</a> a project of Hawai'i Homegrown Food Network and Breadfruit Institute of the National Tropical Botanical Garden, who proclaim, "Anything you can do with potato, you can do with breadfruit … better."</p>
      <p>Breadfruit (also known as 'ulu or 'uru, mei, nmos or lemai) is one of the signature crops of the Pacific Islands.</p>
      <p>"Breadfruit is an energy-rich food and a good source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, and minerals such as potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, and zinc. This nutritious fruit also provides B vitamins, niacin, thiamine, and Vitamin C. Some varieties have high levels of pro-vitamin A carotenoids, nutrients essential to good health. Breadfruit is also gluten-free."</p>

      <h3>Breadfruit Fries</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>1 mature, firm 'ulu<br/>1 ½ qt. Canola oil</p>
      <p>
        <i>Instructions:</i>
      </p>
      <p>Wash, peel (optional) and cut the 'ulu into quarters lengthwise. Remove core and cut into ¼-inch thick slices. Place 'ulu slices in a bowl of cold water until you are ready for the next step.</p>
      <p>Boil 'ulu in 2 qt. of water for five minutes, using about one quarter (about ½ lb.) of 'ulu at a time. After boiling, place slices in cold water for five minutes to cool.</p>
      <p>Remove excess water from 'ulu by placing slices in a sieve or on a paper towel for at least one minute.</p>
      <p>Partially fry (par fry) the 'ulu slices (again, about ½ lb. at a time) in 1 ½ qt. of canola oil heated to 355°F for one minute.</p>
      <p>Remove 'ulu slices from oil and drain, then place on a tray.</p>
      <p>Put the tray of 'ulu in the freezer (about 0°F) from 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>After freezing the 'ulu slides, you have two options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fry frozen slices immediately at 355°F for five minutes.</li>
        <li>Store frozen slices in freezer bags at 0F and fry whenever desired. Be sure to keep slices frozen until the oil is hot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After frying, drain excess oil by placing fries on paper towels. Salt or season to taste.</p>
