      <p>England manager Phil Neville watched on as Everton Women crashed out of the Continental Cup with a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The Blues had it all to do in Group C after being beaten by Birmingham City and Manchester United earlier in the season, but could still have mathematically qualified with two wins from their remaining games.</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> who started the livelier and they almost took the lead in the 15th minute when Chloe Kelly’s close-range volley hit the top of the post.</p>
      <p>Hannah Cain’s pace on the right-wing was causing the visitors problems but the Blues were unable to get on the end of her crosses into the box.</p>
      <p>As the half grew on City began to see a lot more of the ball with Kirsty Levell on hand to make a double save on the half hour mark, first from Ellen White and then from Tessa Wullaert.</p>
      <p>The away side did break the deadlock minutes later when Janine Beckie rose highest to meet Keira Walsh’s corner, her header going in off the post.</p>
      <p>Everton perhaps felt they deserved to be level at the break but they needed only four minutes of the second half to convert an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Great work from Kelly down the left-wing saw the forward play the ball across to Molly Pike, who unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top right-hand corner.</p>
      <p>But City were quick to respond and regained the lead almost instantly, Wallert benefitting from a lapse in concentration in the Blues' defence before squeezing the ball underneath the on-rushing Levell.</p>
      <p>The visitors now had the momentum and began to put the home side under increasing pressure.</p>

      <p>Jill Scott had the chance the make it 3-1 when the ball was played back to her on the edge of the area but the midfielder could only blast her effort over the bar.</p>
      <p>City eventually got their third and it was again a set piece that carved the Blues open as Walsh's ball was met by Steph Houghton at the back post, who headed down for Gemma Bonner to prod home from close-range.</p>
      <p>At 3-1 Everton looked resigned to defeat. Lauren Hemp should have made it 4-1 minutes before she did, blasting over a great chance before making amends by finishing off a well-worked move moments later.</p>
      <p>Inessa Kaagman almost claimed a consolation goal for the Blues in the 90th minute when her long-range effort beat Roebuck, but hit the bar and bounced over.</p>
      <p>Defeat means the Blues' final group game against Leicester will have no consequence but could give Willie Kirk the opportunity to give other players a chance.</p>
      <p>Despite being on the losing side, both Chloe Kelly and Molly Pike caught the eye for Everton and will be hoping the on-looking England manager took note.</p>
      <p>Kelly missed out on making the playing squad for the last two international breaks but joined up with the Lionesses for training while Pike has represented her country at U19 level.</p>
      <p>A call-up for Kelly will likely be more imminent but Pike also looks to have a bright future and may feature in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/phil-neville">Neville</a> 's plans further down the line.</p>
