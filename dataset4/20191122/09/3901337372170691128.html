      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns are trailing Kaizer Chiefs by 10 points although Motjeka Madisha says it is still too early to decide the league title.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi are seated comfortably at the top of the league standings, with both the Soweto side and Sundowns also in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout competition.</p>

      <p>While the focus will be all on the TKO this weekend, in an interview with Soccer Laduma this week, 24-year-old Madisha touched on league title talk, revealing that despite Amakhosi at the top, it is still too early for it to be concluded.</p>
      <p>“They are doing well, to be very honest with you. But we need to focus on ourselves and we will see how things go going forward. For me, it’s still early to conclude who is going to win the league. We don’t look at that (the gap) and, like I said, we are going to take it one step at a time,” he said.</p>
