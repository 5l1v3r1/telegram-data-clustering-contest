      <p><b>Harrison Ford </b>is headed to the small screen in an adaptation of true crime docuseries <i>The Staircase, </i>once again confirming that the true crime wave is far from falling still.</p>
      <p>If you’ve yet to watch the docuseries, it’s about crime novelist <b>Michael Peterson </b>who was accused of killing his wife <b>Kathleen</b> after she was found dead at the bottom of a staircase in their home, and the 16-year judicial battle that followed.</p>
      <p>Peterson claimed Kathleen died after falling down the stairs, but police believe he beat his wife to death and made it look like an accident.</p>
      <p>There have been many theories yelled into the void about what happened to Kathleen, one of which is the very real Owl Theory. If you’re interested, you can watch an explainer on Netflix right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3yTgcKhHqU">here</a>. It’s a unique one, to say the least.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/harrison-ford-the-staircase-series-1203411141/">Variety</a> sources, Ford is keen to executive produce the series as well as star in it. The show itself is currently being shopped to a bunch of networks and streaming services.</p>
      <p><i>The Staircase, </i>all 13 episodes of it, is available for your bingeing pleasure on Netflix now.</p>

      <p>As for Netflix, the streaming giant recently released the trailer for its latest true crime docuseries <i>The Confession Killer. </i></p>
      <p>This docuseries will focus on serial killer <b>Henry Lee Lucas, </b>who claimed to have murdered as many as 600 people around the United States. However, he was only ever convicted of killing three people, including his mother. Lucas said he confessed to the murders after police fed him tranquillisers, steaks, hamburgers, and milkshakes.</p>
      <p>Per Netflix, the five-part docuseries will explore how the man “once called America’s most prolific serial killer was really a complex figure entangled in a flawed justice system.”</p>
      <p><i>The Confession Killers </i>is slated for release December 6.</p>
