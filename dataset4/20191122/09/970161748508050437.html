      <p>Kevin Clifton has confronted a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> fan after they revealed they will boycott the show if there’s any more same-sex routines.</p>
      <p>It’s been confirmed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/strictly-come-dancing-sex-routine-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-prima-sparks-200-complaints-bbc-11193004/">the BBC received almost 200 complaints from viewers</a> who found Johannes Radebe and Grazianno Di Primo’s heart-warming performance together ‘offensive’, even though those very same critics would more than likely feel comfortable watching two men play tennis doubles or 11 gents kick a football about together.</p>
      <p>Naturally, then, questions need to be asked. Kevin Clifton, rather than attacking one of his followers, did just that.</p>

      <p>‘Can i ask why?’ he probed the viewer, who said it was her ‘choice’ to turn away from watching two men or women dance together.</p>
      <p>‘Not looking for an argument just interested in why you have that opinion,’ he added.</p>

      <p>As it stands the critic is yet to respond. Perhaps there’s nothing more to say.</p>
      <p>The BBC refused to comment when approached by Metro.co.uk over the backlash, but it appears while there’s an overriding support for the LGBTQ+ community in the Beeb’s ballroom, there’s a problem with its fan base.</p>

      <p>Last weekend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancing-fans-gutted-michelle-visage-eliminated-facing-saffron-barker-dance-off-11172457/">Michelle Visage was voted out of the competition</a> after paying tribute to her gay brothers and sisters with a routine inspired by voguing; a dance popularised by underground ballrooms in the LGBTQ+ community where those who had been cast away by the mainstream society could truly be liberated without prejudice.</p>
      <p>The RuPaul’s Drag Race star was slammed by thousands of viewers, who claimed ‘voguing isn’t dancing.’</p>
      <p>In turn,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/michelle-visage-defends-risky-voguing-routine-strictly-come-dancing-exit-11172458/"> she fired back with an impassioned post</a> defending her performance, which was without a doubt one of the highlights to come from the Strictly class of 2019.</p>
