        <b>The mother of a three-year-old boy who died at a scandal-hit hospital said her family has not been treated fairly and has been ignored by authorities, as she seeks answers over his death.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mason Djemat died in August 2017 at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow, weeks before 10-year-old Milly Main.</p>
      <p>He had been treated at one of the wards that were later closed following concerns over the water.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch has already said she is 100% certain the death of her daughter Milly, who was being treated for cancer, was linked to contaminated water.</p>

      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman apologised to the families affected as she made a statement to MSPs on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Mason's mother, Victoria Freeman, said she is disappointed at the response from authorities, as she seeks answers over the death of the son she "absolutely adored".</p>
      <p>She told BBC Scotland: "There was no-one listening to me. No-one wanted to help. No-one at all."</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman said she first wrote to the health secretary last September and has been disappointed by the response.</p>
      <p>She said: "I don't think that Mason was acknowledged, particularly by her, and I feel that she did not take Mason's death seriously."</p>

      <p>When asked how she felt she had been treated, she told the BBC: "I don't think as a family we have been treated fairly."</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman said her son had Hunter syndrome, a rare genetic condition, but was "extremely healthy" and strong when he was admitted to the hospital in the summer of 2017, and she was shocked when he suddenly died.</p>

      <p>She said: "To be standing in ICU and thinking over in my head 'What's happened?' I just still don't have the answers and they don't have the answers as well."</p>
      <p>She added: "Mason was the love of my life. Unfortunately I will never be able to replace him. Never.</p>
      <p>"He was just really something. I absolutely adored him."</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: "I cannot begin to imagine the pain of losing a child in these circumstances - or the suffering and grief that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>"My sincerest condolences go to Ms Freeman and the other families affected by this. I also want to assure you all that you will get answers and the support you need.</p>
      <p>"Ms Freeman first contacted me about the death of her son in late 2018, and I responded. She wrote to me again at the start of this year and I replied, and this was followed by further correspondence just a few days ago.</p>
      <p>"I'd like the opportunity to meet with Ms Freeman to listen to her views but also assure her, and the other families affected by this, that we are taking action."</p>
      <p>An NHSGGC spokesman said: "We are very sorry Ms Freeman feels she has unanswered questions regarding the death of her son, Mason Djemat.</p>
      <p>"The case was fully investigated and the outcome shared with the family.</p>
      <p>"We met with Ms Freeman on a number of occasions to respond to any concerns she had and can confirm we remain in contact to answer any follow-up questions."</p>
