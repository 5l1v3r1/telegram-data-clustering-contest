      <h1>Club ‘values’ Arsenal player’s qualities – One factor could be an obstacle for transfer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:37:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this month, journalist <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/club-very-interested-in-arsenal-star-price-wont-be-exorbitant-considering-to-sign-player-in-january/">Juanfe Sanz told El Chiringuito</a> Barcelona are ‘very interested’ in Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and suggested the asking price won’t be exorbitant for any potential transfer.</p>
      <p>Two days ago, <a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/exclu-mercato-arsenal-aubameyang-pas-presse-de-prolonger-481728">Le10 Sport reported</a> the forward is closely followed by the La Liga winners. They also explained the 30-year-old has postponed contract talks with the Gunners.</p>
      <p>His current deal at the Emirates expires in 2021 and reports in England suggested the Gabon international wants to see whether or not Unai Emery’s side will qualify for next season’s Champions League.</p>
      <p>Friday’s edition of <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/">Mundo Deportivo</a> has picked up these claims and it’s stated the Catalan club ‘values’ the former Borussia Dortmund star’s qualities.</p>

      <p>However, the player’s age (he’ll turn 31 next June) would be an obstacle for Ernesto Valverde’s side in signing him.</p>
      <p>Mundo adds that Arsenal could agree to negotiate his transfer next summer, if Aubameyang decides not to renew his contract with the Premier League side.</p>
