      <p>The home guard attendance scam that came to light in Gautam Buddh Nagar district (Noida) with the siphoning off Rs 4 crore government money through fake attendance has now spread to Lucknow district with the arrest of district home guard commandant.</p>
      <p>Lucknow district home guard commandant Kripa Shankar Pandey has been accused of cheating, dishonesty and forgery of documents after it was found that his office prepared fake muster-rolls showing inflated attendance of the home guards at Gudamba and Vibhuti Khand police stations to siphon off extra money sanctioned by the government as their salary.</p>
      <p>This comes a day after five home guard officials were arrested by Gautam Buddh Nagar Police in connection with the Rs 4 crore attendance scam there.</p>
      <p>According to Lucknow police, an investigation found that records at district commandant office and Gudamba police station general diary showed a difference in the attendance of home guards, similar on the patterns in Gautam Buddh Nagar district. Similar discrepancies were also found at Vibhuti Khand police station in Lucknow. The amount of money allegedly siphoned off at Gudamba police station is reported to be around Rs 4.99 lakh. A similar amount of money is expected to have been siphoned off at Vibhuti Khand police station.</p>
      <p>“It was found that several times the extra money was sanctioned against the amount of salary that should have been sanctioned for the home guards available at the police stations… In the months of July and August this year, there was a difference of more than three times between the salary amount to be paid and the number of workdays as per the home guard office and the police general diary. After scrutinising the document copy verified by home guard headquarter, it was found that on the basis of fake muster-rolls, irregular payments of Rs 4.99 lakh was made in two months. Similar irregularities were found in Vibhuti Khand police station, too. Pages of the muster-roll were changed in district commandant office and without the approval or signature of the police station, the salary was sanctioned,” said Senior Superintendent of Police (Lucknow) Kalanidhi Naithani.</p>
      <p>“In August, Gudamba police station in-charge had informed district commandant that instead of 23 appointed home guards, only eight were working. But the salary for all the 23 was sanctioned with fake muster-rolls in both July and August. Prima facie it appears to be a case of embezzlement of government money and making fake muster-rolls,” he added.</p>
      <p>The FIR has been registered against the home guard district commandant office, its officials and employees at Gomti Nagar police station under IPC sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document).</p>
      <p>According to the SSP, the probe was ordered after there were reports from concerned police stations that said a number of home guards were not available at the police station, but still fake muster rolls were prepared with fake signatures. “Based on this report, the station house officer (SHO) of Gudamba police station got an FIR registered at Gomti Nagar where the district commandant office is situated. Kripa Shankar Pandey has been arrested and further investigations are on,” Naithani said, adding that while there could be more arrested no involvement of any police officer has been found so far.</p>
      <p>Naithani also said that earlier there was an inquiry in connection to the irregularities at Gudamba police station by Pratibha Ambedkar, then staff officer (SO) to Commandant General home guards, but the report was never made public.</p>
      <p>As per the FIR registered, a verified copy of the SO’s inquiry report was provided to the SHO.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Divisional Home Guard Commandant (Aligarh) Ram Narayan Chaurasia, Assistant District Commandant of Gautam Buddh Nagar Satish Chandra and three more officials — Montu Kumar, Shailendra Kumar and Satyaveer Yadav — were arrested for the attendance scam there.</p>
