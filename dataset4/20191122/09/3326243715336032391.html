      <p>How long can a single trial go on for? Well apparently Apple and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/virnetx/">VirnetX</a> want to find out, as yet another decision out of a United States appeal court will undoubtedly fuel things along.</p>
      <p>This particular <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/04/11/virnetx-wins-500-million-usd-apple-lawsuit/">legal battle</a> between the two companies has been going on for <i>nine years</i>, and while there have been close call resolutions in the past, including Apple being forced to pay millions of dollars in a patent dispute, things just keep trucking along anyway. For example, the latest decision (via <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virnetx-patent-win-against-apple-161151192.html"><i>Reuters</i></a>) from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has vacated the latest appeal, forcing the decision back to a lower court in Texas.</p>
      <p>This decision is even more complicated than it probably needs to be. Specifically, it’s a bit of a mixed bag for Apple, because the appeals court ruled only a partial reversal when it’s all said and done. The court confirmed two cases of patent infringement, and reversed two others.</p>
      <blockquote>The court reversed the jury’s infringement finding on two other patents, however. Based on that ruling, the court sent the case back to a Texas judge for further proceedings.<br/>The Texas judge must consider whether to hold a new damages-only trial or to recalculate damages without holding one, the appeals court said.</blockquote>
      <p>This is just one of two legal battles going on between VirnetX and Apple. This one saw Apple having to pay upwards of $503 million in patent infringement. The other, which also has a series of appeals in the works, has already ruled against Apple, telling the company to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/01/15/virnetx-patent-case-440-million/">pay $440 million</a> in that patent case.</p>
      <p>As far as the patent war going on between the two companies, the patents in question relate to virtual private networks (VPNs), FaceTime, and iMessage.</p>
