      <h1>The high-level Swansea City group trip to watch Wales and why Swans star couldn't stay for the celebrations</h1>
      <h2>The Swans boss stressed his commitment to development</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:11:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Coleman</a></address>
      <p>Steve Cooper says Swansea City will continue doing their bit to ensure that Wales continues to enjoy a rich production line of young and exciting talent.</p>
      <p>Cooper was in attendance at the Cardiff City Stadium as Wales sealed Euro 2020 qualification with a 2-0 win over Hungary, with Swans star Connor Roberts playing a key role for his country once again on a memorable night for Welsh football.</p>
      <p>Wales have enjoyed the fruits of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-city-fc">Swansea's</a> academy system, with four of Tuesday's starting XI starting their careers in SA1.</p>
      <p>And, on the evidence of the under-21s, who sealed a 1-0 win over Bosnia just hours before, there could well be more to come.</p>
      <p>Goalscorer Liam Cullen and the highly-rated Ben Cabango, whom Cooper believes is close to a first-team breakthrough, were among four other players to start.</p>
      <p>"Youth development is all about individual programmes and recognising what's needed for what player," Cooper said.</p>
      <p>"And I think that's where it's at for some of the boys now featuring for the 23s and with us. Is their programme going to get them to where we and they want to be, which is in our first team?</p>
      <p>"It can include loans, or just training with the first team, it can be a case of keeping players in with the under-23s a little while longer, so I think that's where we're at. Youth development is all about players and nothing else and individual development.</p>
      <p>"What's important is that first-team staff have experience in dealing with young players.</p>
      <p>"When we're ready to play players, I think we have the right support mechanisms in place for them.</p>

      <p>"For instance, we're not going to buy a player that's marginally better than an under-23s player.</p>
      <p>"That doesn't make sense to me."</p>
      <p>One man who missed out on international duty this week is Joe Rodon, who was also in the stands to cheer on his team-mates on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>However, he was unable to join in the post-match festivities - because he needed a lift home with his boss.</p>
      <p>"We were out in force really," Cooper added. "Myself and Marshy were there. We took Joe Rodon as well. Obviously he was still on his crutches.</p>
      <p>"Trevor was there, Leon was there. My dad sat with us. We went there obviously supporting Wales, but also supporting Connor too.</p>
      <p>"Joe didn't get to join in with the celebrations because he needed a lift home with us!</p>
      <p>"We had to go!</p>
      <p>"No, but seriously, he was buzzing, as was Connor. Obviously Joe needs to get fit and when he is. It'll be great for them both to feature."</p>
