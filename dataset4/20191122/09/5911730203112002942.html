      <p>TAMPA, Fla. â€” The <a href="https://www.tampasdowntown.com/">Tampa Downtown Partnership</a> wants to add more murals to the Channelside area in an effort to add culture and increase tourism in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
      <p>Artist Terry Klaaren is the eigth artist to receive a $2,500 grant as part of the <a href="https://www.tampasdowntown.com/grant-program/">Activate Downtown Micro-Grant Program.</a></p>
      <p>For Klaaren, the project has special meaning.</p>
      <p>His mural, located near Washington and 12th Street, is in honor of his late wife. She passed away earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"It's very therapeutic to me to work on something that will be around hopefully for a long long time here and it kind of tells a story or gives an idea of who my wife was, the wonderful person that she was," says Klaaren.</p>
      <p>Klaaren has lived in Tampa for many years, In fact, he painted murals on more than 100 schools, hospitals and homes throughout Hillsborough County. Fun fact: if you visited MOSI he designed the Recyclosaurus.</p>
      <p>Linda Remund says the Downtown Partnership still has grants available for an artist who wants to improve the area.</p>
      <p>"It really just adds to the eclectic nature of the community," says Remund.</p>
