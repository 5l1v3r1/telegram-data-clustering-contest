      <p>While the £2.5m price-tag might seem steep at first, the property boasts a hoard of incredible features.</p>
      <p>Most notably, the grounds - which span 20 acres - include fully irrigated wine slopes.</p>
      <p>With the perfect California climate, any potential buyers could turn the slopes into a fully functioning vineyard in no time.</p>
      <p>As you'd expect, the muscle-bound star - who wrestled between 1997 and 2004, before making a comeback between 2016 and 2019 - has a monster gym at his home.</p>
      <p>The four-bedroom, four-bathroom home also has a spacious living room, kitchen, dining room and even an office.</p>
      <p>The back garden is perfect for the sunny West Coast days, complete with an impressive pool - with a waterfall and slide - as well as a spa.</p>
      <p>Outside, the gated home can be entered via a long driveway - while there is also a basketball court, a fire pit and a horse stable.</p>
      <p>But the piece de resistance outside is the humongous garage, large enough to fit more than 20 vehicles.</p>
      <p>The huge building has even featured on American TV shows Garage Dreams and Garage Mahal for its one-of-a-kind appeal.</p>
      <p>Since retiring from wrestling, the former WCW World Heavyweight Championship winner, has gone into acting.</p>

      <p>As well as appearing in Adam Sandler film The Longest Yard in 2005 amongst others, Goldberg has appeared in a host of TV shows.</p>
      <p>Along with appearances on reality programmes such as Garage Mahal and Punk'd, the American has provided voiceovers in Family Guy and Kim Possible, as well as roles in Law &amp; Order and NCIS.</p>
      <p>More recently, Goldberg played PE coach Nick Mellor in hit show, The Goldbergs...</p>
