      <h1>Joel Matip issues injury update as Liverpool defender targets comeback</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool have a series of injuries ahead of their Premier League fixture with Crystal Palace, with Joel Matip definitely missing the clash due to a long term knee issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:34:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:34</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Joel Matip has admitted that he hasn't put a time-frame on his return to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> side.</p>
      <p>Centre back Matip suffered a knee injury during the Reds' Premier League victory over Sheffield United in October.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old missed a 4-3 win at home to RB Salzburg in the Champions League and the narrow triumph over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> but returned to Jurgen Klopp's back line against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> after three weeks absent.</p>
      <p>But since the draw at Old Trafford, Matip has been laid off by the injury and is still yet to return to training.</p>
      <p>Liverpool face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> at Selhurst Park on Saturday but will have to do so without Matip again.</p>

      <p>"I don't want to put a time on it," Matip told Sky Sports. "I'm just taking my time and we'll see.</p>
      <p>"Of course it's hard to get injured but unfortunately that's the life of a player. I am working hard at the moment to get back.</p>
      <p>"I'm always trying to do my best, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Hopefully I'm back as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Matip is one of a number of injury worries for Klopp for the trip to south London.</p>

      <p>Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson are both doubts with ankle injuries, Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson both returned from international duty early with problems, while Virgil van Dijk walked out on Holland as a result of "personal issues".</p>
      <p>Cameroon international Matip was left heartbroken by Liverpool's failure to win the Premier League last season, having missed out by a point to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>But he insists that he and his teammates have learned lessons from that near miss.</p>
      <p>"You can learn from everything. Even if you fail. It was a hard time but we didn't do too badly last season and we'll try to improve," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are in November, it's so early in the season. We just want to win the next game and we'll see.</p>
      <p>"It's great to be in this position, we've worked really hard to be here but we cannot rest. There's no time to rest."</p>
