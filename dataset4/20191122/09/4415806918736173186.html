      <h1>Floyd Mayweather Jr announces he will come out of retirement in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:08:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather Jr has said he is coming out of retirement.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old American has not fought since the 50th fight and 50th win of his career in August 2017.</p>
      <p>That was over UFC star Conor McGregor, a bout fought under boxing rules.</p>
      <p>A rematch, possibly under UFC rules, has long been touted, as have traditional ring returns against a number of opponents.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post, Mayweather – a five-weight world champion – simply said: “Coming out of retirement in 2020”.</p>

      <p>And hinting that his claimed return will be something more than a boxing one, he posted another picture with UFC boss Dana White, who helped promote the McGregor fight, saying the pair were “working together again”.</p>
