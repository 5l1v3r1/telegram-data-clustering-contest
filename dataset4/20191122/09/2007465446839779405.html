      <h1>2020 Porsche Taycan 4S is proof EVs can be sexy</h1>
      <h2>Porsche holds US launch of the all-new Taycan 4S</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:31:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>There's no denying that Porsche's answer to Tesla, the Taycan, has garnered praise from all over. First made available in the Turbo and Turbo S trim models, it was soon joined by the 'entry-level' version, the 4S.</p>
      <p>Regardless if it is the base model or not, Porsche made sure that the Taycan 4S is as good-looking as its more powerful siblings. And what better way to appreciate it than being able to see it first-hand in the metal.</p>

      <p>During the 2019 Los Angeles Motor Show, Porsche held the US launch of the new Taycan 4S. While we may already be familiar with its looks from press photos, we were not exactly sure how good it looked in the metal. Despite having four doors, its unique shape still evokes a sporty appearance.</p>

      <p>From its distinct Panamera-like front end, to the tear-drop shaped roofline reminescent of the 911, as well as the singular LED taillight that serves as a throwback to the classic 959, the Taycan is indeed a looker. However, unlike the Taycan Turbo and Turbo S, the 4S rolls on smaller 19-inch wheels. But other than that, the 4S still looks similar to the rest of the range.</p>

      <p>Open the doors and an array of digital displays make their way inside the EV. The 10.9-inch instrument panel features a curved display that is capable of showing three dials. Meanwhile, making their home at the center dashboard are two huge touchscreens. The first one serves as the infotainment display, while the bigger one below it manages the climate control system. Also available is a separate touchscreen the front passenger can manipulate. A partial leather upholstery comes as standard, although customers that prefer non-leather trim can avail of that as well.</p>

      <p>Powering the Taycan 4S is a 79.2-kWh lithium-ion battery back. This translates to a power output of 522 PS. Opt for the bigger 93.4-kWh battery pack, and the Taycan 4S is capable of cranking out 563 PS. From a standstill, this electric Porsche can reach 100 km/h in only 3.8 seconds and reach a top speed of 250 km/h. With the standard battery, the Taycan 4S can travel 407 km. However, it can travel further when equipped with the bigger battery pack at 463 km.</p>

      <p>Will PGA Cars ever bring the Taycan to the Philippines? With the Taycan 4S selling for about $110,380 abroad (about Php 5.614 million), maybe there is a possibility. But we can expect importation costs, custom duties, as well as tariffs to jack the price way up. Still, we wouldn't mind seeing Porsche's high performance EVs make their way to the country, but we'll need the charging infrastructure to make them viable.Â </p>
