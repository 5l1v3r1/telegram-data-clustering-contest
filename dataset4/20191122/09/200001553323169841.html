      <p>Barcelona wanted to sign Willian in 2018, but their failure to reach an agreement with Chelsea scuppered things.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international has become one of the key players under Frank Lampard and the manager has urged the Blues to offer a new deal to the 31-year-old.</p>
      <p>His current expires at the end of June 2020.</p>
      <p>On November 13th, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/front-page-report-claims-club-attentive-of-chelsea-star-blues-player-iewed-as-market-opportunity/">Mundo Deportivo reported</a> the La Liga winners are ‘attentive’ to the player’s situation.</p>
      <p>Friday’s edition of the <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/">same newspaper</a> has an update on the South American with a title ‘Fabián and Willian, waiting for what happens’.</p>
      <p>Should the Spanish champions decide to allow some of their midfielders to leave, they could then turn towards the players they like, and this includes Napoli’s Fabián Ruiz and Willian.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea star’s versatility, coupled with his contract situation, makes him an interesting option for Barca.</p>

      <p>Barcelona are also in the market for a new centre-back due to Gerard Piqué’s age (he’ll turn 33 next February) and Samuel Umtiti’s longstanding injury problems.</p>
      <p>Mundo claims the Blaugrana follow Nikola Milenković, who is a regular for Fiorentina and Serbia.</p>
      <p>Willian’s club teammate Andreas Christensen is another centre-back target. Regarding the Dane, Mundo state Barca have ‘accumulated many reports for a long time’.</p>
