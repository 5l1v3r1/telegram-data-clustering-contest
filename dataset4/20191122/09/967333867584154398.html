        <b>Donald Trump is arguably a man of many talents.

      <p>US President Donald Trump has unexpectedly become a "songwriter" since a photo of the his handwritten notes in which he denied seeking a quid pro quo with Ukraine went viral on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The notes written in black marker, almost entirely in capital letters read: “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelenskiy do the right thing. This is the final word from the Pres. of the US".</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911211077364064-sharpie-defense-netizens-roast-trumps-i-want-nothing-notes-quid-pro-quo-timeline/">the photo of the president’s notes</a> was posted on social media some netizens quickly pointed out that they look like lyrics, which prompted other users to create songs featuring Trump’s statements in different music styles.</p>
      <p>Punk band the Ramones broke up in 1996, but it seems that their music is still relevant today as the Ramones stylised song, created by musician Alex Kliment, has been listened to more than 2 million times on Twitter</p>

      <p>​Emo band My Chemical Romance should have thought twice before reuniting because they're now facing huge competition from other artists, especially when lyrics are written by President of the United States. Nick Lutsko’s emo version of Trump’s statements was listened to more than half a million times on social media.</p>

      <p>​Listening to another iteration of Trump’s speech will make you think that it’s the middle of the 1980s, because it’s a stylised version of the Smiths. This song, created by user RuPaul Giamatti was listened to more than 600,000 times.</p>

      <p>​One can’t predict who will win the upcoming elections in the United States, but it seems that if Trump loses he should pursue a career in the music industry.</p>
