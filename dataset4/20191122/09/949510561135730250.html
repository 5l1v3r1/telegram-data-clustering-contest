      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):</p>
      <p>9:35 a.m.</p>
      <p>Technology companies and banks are leading stocks slightly higher on Wall Street in early trading, putting the market on track for its first gain since Monday.</p>
      <p>Oracle rose 1.2% in the first few minutes of trading Friday and Wells Fargo added 0.9%.</p>
      <p>The gains weren’t enough to erase a weekly loss for the S&amp;P 500 index, which is on track to break a six-week winning streak.</p>
      <p>The gains were broad. In a sign investors were feeling more optimistic, safe-play sectors like utilities were pulling up the rear.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 4 points, or 0.1%, to 3,108.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44 points, or 0.1%, to 27,808. The Nasdaq added 15 points, or 0.2%, to 8,521.</p>
      <p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.76%.</p>
