      <h1>Donald Trump wants Tim Cook to build 5G in the United States</h1>
      <h2>Don and dusted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:52:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/6082/alan-martin" target="_blank">Alan Martin</a></address>
      <p><b>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S</b> tweets are <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/feature/3067899/trumps-best-tweets-of-2018">erratic at the best of times</a> (your definition of "erratic" and "best of times" may vary), but the last 48 hours have been absolutely vintage.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the president was taking credit for opening a new Apple plant (it was <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3084123/trump-lies-apple-factory-texas">neither new nor an Apple plant</a>). Then he chatted about how he's been trying to perfect the art of eavesdropping on private conversations without success, as you do.</p>

      <p>Now he's talking about his special relationship with new BFF <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3072175/donald-trump-thinks-apples-ceo-is-called-tim-apple-because-of-course">Tim Apple</a>. Specifically, how Trump has been lobbying Cook to have his company "get involved in building 5G in the US". Trump's personal comments, both positive and negative, always tend to be extremes - people are either the best or the worst - and here he lays on the praise pretty thick: "They have it all - Money, Technology, Vision &amp; Cook!" he tweeted. Presumably he <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3071522/donald-trump-6g">also has Cook in mind for 6G</a>.</p>

      <p>The one thing Apple doesn't have is any expertise in 5G. In the states, the infrastructure is largely handled by four companies: Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Hell, the company doesn't even make its own modems, as anybody following <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3072344/qualcomm-wants-apple-to-cough-up-usd31m-in-patent-battle">the Qualcomm/Apple legal battle</a> will know.</p>
      <p>It would kind of be like Cook asking Trump if he could build a power station, given he's so good at making golf courses.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Cook himself explained Apple's lack of interest in getting into networking three years ago, back when Trump was just a wacky candidate, rather than a wacky president.</p>
      <p>"Our expertise doesn't extend to the network," Cook <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/05/24/apple-mvno-no-tim-cook/">said</a> at Startup Fest Europe. "We've worked with AT&amp;T in the US, O2 in the UK, as well as T-Mobile and Orange, and we expanded as we learned more. But generally, the things Apple likes to do, are things we can do globally.</p>
      <p>"We don't have the network skill. We'll do some things along the way with e-SIMs along the way, but in general, I like the things carriers do."</p>
      <p>Acknowledging your limitations is a useful life skill, but one that Trump, at the ripe old age of 73, is yet to master. The president still believes he could have <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1641093/donald-trump-dreamed-of-playing-in-the-majors-on-when-i-was-17/">been a professional baseball player</a>, run into a school on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-he-would-have-run-florida-school-n851266">shooting lockdown without a weapon</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1198173/donald-trump-claims-he-could-have-nailed-princess-di-but-denies-stalking-royal/">boinked Princess Diana</a>. Albeit probably not on the same day. </p>
      <p>Then again, this is somebody who has defied the odds to get <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339/#actor">Hollywood movie credits</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkghtyxZ6rc">star in the WWE</a> and become president, so maybe Tim Cook just isn't dreaming big enough. µ</p>
