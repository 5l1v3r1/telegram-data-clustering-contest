      <h1>Canada Water and Canary Wharf stations evacuated as 'dust storm' hits platforms</h1>
      <h2>Footage shows a haze in the air as Canada Water station, in south-east London, is evacuated and passengers leave a crowded platform</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:29:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Two busy Tube stations were evacuated after passengers were caught up in a "dust storm" at the height of the morning commute.</p>
      <p>Footage shows a haze in the air at Canada Water station, in south-east London, as passengers walk up the stairs and others wait on the crowded platform.</p>
      <p>Canary Wharf was also evacuated after a fan malfunctioned and sent dust on the platforms at both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/london-underground">London Underground</a> stations.</p>
      <p>Initially, passengers feared the haze was smoke from a fire or gas.</p>
      <p>Trains did not stop at either station for a time as the incident led to severe delays on the Jubilee Line and congestion at other stations, including London Bridge.</p>

      <p>A passenger wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: "Just got evacuated from Canada Water station. Got really smokey in there..."</p>
      <p>One added: "@TfL just been evacuated from Canada Water with smoke billowing from the platform can you tell us whatâ€™s going on please???"</p>
      <p>Transport for London later said a fan had malfunctioned, sending dust into both stations.</p>

      <p>A commuter, who was forced to leave Canada Water, told Mirror Online: "I don't think it was anything serious.</p>
      <p>"There was just some sort of dust storm inside the station, which I guess isn't normal.</p>
      <p>"Canada Water and Canary Wharf are shut though."</p>

      <p>Passengers said alarms sounded as the stations were evacuated.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "The jubilee line is MAD this morning. &amp; Canary Wharf &amp; Canada Water are closer due to fire alarms."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Another morning of absolute chaos!!"</p>
      <p>A commuter who posted video of passengers leaving a hazy Canada Water station wrote: "Canada Water Station being evacuated - some sort of gas/smoke."</p>
      <p>Both stations reopened at about 9.45am with delays on the Jubilee Line.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, the line has been hit by a reduced service due to faulty trains.</p>
