      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:23:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> fries are the best fries.</p>
      <p>And today they just got even better than ever before, as McDonald's has decided to hand out full size portions of its famous fries for free.</p>
      <p>Today (22 November), for one day only, the fast food restaurant chain is handing out free portions of medium chips to everyone that orders through the McDonald's app.</p>
      <p>Available to new and existing customers, there's just 26 branches that won't be accepting the offer - we've got the full list today.</p>
      <p>McDonald's fans that spotted the offer earlier on this week may be pleased to know that McDonald's has since retracted the original list of non-participating stores, as it was apparently an older version of a similar offer, so there's now just 26 branches of McDonald's that won't be handing out the free fries.</p>

      <p>If you're new to the McDonald's app, as usual, to complete registration, new users must go into the restaurant for their first order – otherwise this offer works for click and collect, through the Drive Thru and from this week, for orders placed and delivered directly to your table thanks to the nationwide introduction of Table Markers.</p>
