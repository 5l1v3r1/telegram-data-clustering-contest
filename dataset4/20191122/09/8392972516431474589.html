      <p>Ant didn't host last year's show with Dec as he took most of the year off to focus on his recovery and sobriety.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year, he had been arrested for drink-driving and then later checked into rehab.</p>
      <p>When the show returned on Sunday night, Ant made a joke about his year off.</p>

      <p>Dec said: "We're back, he's back, I'm back, we're all back."</p>
      <p>The presenter then struggled to deliver a line and Ant joked: "I've had a year off! What's your excuse?"</p>
      <p>Viewers were thrilled to have the pair back together after last year saw Dec joined by This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby.</p>
      <p>However, some people were <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-beg-holly-willoughby-to-return-as-host/">missing Holly and begged for her to return on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>One person said: "I’m saying it. Holly was better last year with Dec than Ant &amp; Dec this year."</p>
