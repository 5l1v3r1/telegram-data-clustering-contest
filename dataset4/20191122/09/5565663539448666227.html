      <p>The Zimbabwe Republic Police has sent its Support Unit to train at the military base on how to control crowds in Zimbabwe amidst impending protests over the declining economy Professor Jonathan Moyo has revealed <br/><br/>Writing on micro blogging site Twitter Moyo said, "The Police Support Unit is currently conducting <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-search-keyword-CrowdControl.html">#CrowdControl</a> training at 2 Brigade, Cranbone, bringing together the Army, Police and CIO."<br/><br/>Moyo added that the police that bashed MDC supporters on Wednesday were from the military base.<br/><br/>" The vicious cops that unleashed yesterday's gratuitous violence on MDC supporters, bystanders and passersby came from the 2 Brigade Unit!"<br/><br/>When questioned what is wrong with the security forces sharing information Moyo said, "Sharing information is not the same as sharing uniforms to enable the Army to brutalise civilians in military uniforms!"</p>

      <p>In February this year a Harare man  told the court that he got a military uniform he used to terrorise residents from the ZANU PF headquarters. <br/><br/>The man Shepherd Magorimbo  was standing trial after being arrested for a string of robberies that took place during the violent protests that rocked Zimbabwe in January. <br/> <br/>"We were given the uniform at the party office," Magorimbo said in response to a question by the prosecutor.</p>
