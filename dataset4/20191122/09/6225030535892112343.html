      <p>This week on <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/blogs/HorseCenter">HorseCenter</a></b>, co-hosts Brian Zipse and Matt Shifman predict the winners for the 2019 Eclipse Awards.</p>
      <p>The guys agree on most of the would-be champions, but there's a lively debate to be had about both the 3-year-old male and female divisions, along with the Older Dirt Male category.</p>
      <p>Matt leans to the sprinters like <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/covfefe">Covfefe</a></b> and <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Mitole">Mitole</a>, but Brian prefers the distance horses <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/guarana">Guarana</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/vino_rosso">Vino Rosso</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Members of the NTRA, Daily Racing Form and National Turf Writers and Broadcasters -- of which Horse Racing Nation has a few -- will vote on the Eclipse Awards at year's end, with the winners announced in January.</p>
      <p>Next week, HorseCenter will preview the Thanksgiving weekend stakes racing. And always, thanks for watching the show.</p>
