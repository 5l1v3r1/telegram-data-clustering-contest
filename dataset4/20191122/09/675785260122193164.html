      <h2>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager will make his managerial bow with Spurs when they take on West Ham in the lunchtime kick-off on Saturday</h2>

      <p>New Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho reportedly made an inspiring speech to his players during his first training session on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed just hours after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked, and wasted no time in trying to get the players on his side.</p>
      <p>According to Portuguese outlet <a href="https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/detalhe/mourinho-abana-balneario-do-tottenham?ref=Tottenham_DestaquesPrincipais">Record</a> Mourinho gave an impassioned talk where he told players he would be "your father, friend, girlfriend, whatever you want."</p>
      <p>He also allegedly was quick to stress that the players are far better than their current league form suggests, with Spurs languishing in 14th position with just three wins from their opening 12 games of the Premier League season.</p>

      <p>He pulled aside the players he considers the leaders in the squad, such as Hugo Lloris, Harry Kane and Toby Alderweireld, for individual chats, and also joked about his comments in 2015 that he would never manage <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> due to his links to their rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>Mourinho's Spurs face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday and he is no doubt desperate to hit the ground running with three points, with a win taking Tottenham to at least sixth place temporarily in the table.</p>
      <p>Any doubts over Mourinho's motivation for managing Spurs were ended in his first press conference, in which he insisted he couldn't be any happier to take over and that he was delighted with the squad he was inheriting.</p>

      <p>"I couldn't be happier," he said. "I do not need new players. I just need to get to know these ones better. I know them well – but you never know them well enough until you meet them.</p>
      <p>"I told the players I came here because of them. I tried to buy some for different clubs and some I didn’t even try, because you know how difficult it was."</p>
