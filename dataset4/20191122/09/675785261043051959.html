      <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson assessment of Ryan Giggs as a manager after Wales reach Euro 2020</h1>
      <h2>Giggs has helped guide his country to their second consecutive European Championships and his former mentor has been impressed with what he has seen</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:19:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has praised his former player Ryan Giggs after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend inspired Wales to next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p>Wales' 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday ensured they finished second in Group E and therefore qualified automatically for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Giggs was appointed in January 2018 and has an impressive record of nine wins, three draws and seven losses in his 19 games in charge so far.</p>
      <p>And speaking in London at a fundraiser for football charity Grassroot Soccer, Ferguson said he knew Giggs would be destined for a career in management.</p>
      <p>"Ryan was always going to be a top man," Ferguson said. "He is intelligent, he has great drive about him and is doing a great job with Wales- and giving young players a chance too. It is fantastic."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ryan-giggs-critics-told-eat-20925259">Stoke City's Joe Allen was also full of praise for Giggs</a> following confirmation of Wales' qualification, saying he has made critics 'eat their words.'</p>
      <p>“The ambition and target was to get to the Euros," he said. "He has done the job. Any way you get there is huge success.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of people are going to have to eat their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us.</p>
      <p>“He has delivered, simple as that. He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough but he has got us there.</p>

      <p>“I think questions have been asked of everything really – selection, tactics - but nine times out of ten he has got it right. That is one of the big reasons we have made it."</p>
      <p>Wales will discover who they will face in the group stages of Euro 2020 when the draw takes place in Bucharest, Romania on 30 November.</p>
