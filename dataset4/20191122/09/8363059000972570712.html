      <h1>OnePlus is Knocking Money Off the OnePlus 7 Pro for Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:30:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>I'd like Black Friday to be over now, because I'm a bit sick of all the deals coming in for discounts that kick off before Black Friday actually takes place. You know who you are, retailers, and tech companies, don't think we haven't noticed.</p>
      <p>Anyway the latest company to join the scrum is OnePlus, which has announced that the OnePlus 7 Pro and OnePlus 7 will be getting a discount from today. With the OnePlus 7T and seriously underwhelming OnePlus 7T Pro already out, I suppose they have to shift the old stock somehow.</p>
      <p>Amazon, John Lewis, and Three will be offering deals on both phones between the 22nd November (today) and 2nd December:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazon are offering up to 20% off the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-RAM-256-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Mirror-Grey/dp/B07RFWG93C?ref_=ast_sto_dp">OnePlus 7</a> and<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-Pro-RAM-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Nebula-Blue/dp/B07RCXCPV5"> 7 Pro</a></li>
        <li>John Lewis are knocking <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/oneplus-7-pro-smartphone-android-6-67-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-8gb-ram-256gb-nebula-blue-oneplus-bullets-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black-red-bundle/p238433258">£100 off the OnePlus 7 Pro</a>, including the Limited Edition Almond colour. No word on whether that will also still include <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/john-lewis-black-friday-oneplus-7-pro-deal/">the free Bullet Wireless headphones.</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.three.co.uk/oneplus/7-pro?colour=dark%20grey&amp;memory=128&amp;paym=true">Three are offering a couple of deals</a>, including up to £85 off the OnePlus 7 Pro when you buy PAYG with a £10 minimum top-up, plus a £3 saving on various 24 month contracts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Yes they're not the latest OnePlus offerings, but these phones are barely six months old - so they're still very new and shiny. Also the OnePlus 7 Pro is basically the same as the OnePlus 7T Pro anyway, so it's not like you're missing out on anything.</p>
