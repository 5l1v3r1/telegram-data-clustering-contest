      <p>Many of us have been waiting since July for a public hearing on the proposed Costco in Lake Stevens. We recently received notice that the hearing would finally be held on Nov. 26. Many of us felt that date, just two days before the Thanksgiving holiday was simply an attempt to limit the number who would show up to testify. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the city has added two other hearings at that same place and time on amendments to their comprehensive plan and 2020 budget, publishing the notice just ten days before the hearing! Too many things on one night is a way to discourage folks to show up and testify.</p>
      <p>For those who may not be aware, their comprehensive plan calls for commercial on the south side of 20th Street adjacent to and incompatible with the rural areas between 20th and South Lake Stevens Road. An area that contains many critical areas, streams, wetlands and wildlife habitat that will be degraded, not just by the Costco plan but by this plan for the 20th Street corridor.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to comment on the comp plan, send written comments before the hearing or testify in person. Comments can be sent to City Hall, Attn: Russ Wright, PO Box 257, Lake Stevens, WA 98258 or by email at rwright@lakestevenswa.gov.</p>
