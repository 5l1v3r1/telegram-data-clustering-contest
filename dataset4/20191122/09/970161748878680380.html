      <p>Daniel Craig has confirmed No Time To Die will mark his last outing as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bond/">James Bond</a>.</p>
      <p>The actor has played 007 since 2006’s Casino Royale, going on to star in Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre.</p>
      <p>But after next year’s No Time To Die – the 25th Bond film – the 51-year-old will be hanging up his tuxedo.</p>
      <p>Craig was speaking to German publication Express when he was asked if his era as Bond is really over.</p>
      <p>The star said: ‘Yes – in the future someone else has to do it.’</p>

      <p>The Knives Out star also shot down claims that he would turn to directing Bond 26 after handing over the reins, saying: ‘For God’s sake, no. I want to come home, eat something and then go to bed.</p>
      <p>‘If you’re a director, then at night you’re still with the producers, screenwriters, on the phone. And then after two hours of sleep, you have to go back up to the set. No thanks.’</p>

      <p>Daniel previously insisted he wouldn’t return to Bond after 2015’s Spectre, making infamous comments about preferring to ‘slash [his] wrists’ than play the secret agent again.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Time Out weeks before Spectre’s release, the father-of-two said: ‘Now? I’d rather … slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t know what the next step is. I’ve no idea. Not because I’m trying to be cagey. Who the f*** knows? At the moment, we’ve done it. I’m not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.’</p>
      <p>He later called it a ‘stupid answer’, but we guess the money was good enough as Craig signed on to play Bond one last time.</p>
      <p>Actors rumoured to be taking on the iconic role after Craig’s departure include Idris Elba, Richard Madden, James Norton, Tom Hardy, Aidan Turner and Riz Ahmed.</p>
