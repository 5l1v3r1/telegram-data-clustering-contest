      <p>The intraday selling bias surrounding the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">British pound</a> picked up some pace in the last hour and dragged the GBP/USD pair to fresh weekly lows, around the 1.2880-75 region.<br/> <br/>The pair failed to capitalize on its early uptick to the 1.2925-30 region and turned lower for the fourth consecutive session on Friday. The intraday pullback accelerated further following the disappointing release of the first even preliminary UK PMI prints for November.<br/> <br/>The first-ever flash version of the UK <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Manufacturing PMI</a> fell more-than-expected to 48.3 in November, while the Services PMI also fell short of expectations and came in at 48.6 during the reported month – marking its weakest reading since July 2016.<br/> <br/>The softer readings could very well be seen as pointing to a possible UK economic contraction during the fourth quarter of 2019 and turned out to be one of the key factors behind the pair's latest leg of a sudden drop of around 40-50 pips over the past hour or so.<br/> <br/>It will now be interesting to see if the pair is able to find any buying interest at lower levels or the ongoing slide marks a near-term bearish breakdown, setting the stage for an extension of the recent pullback from the vicinity of the key 1.30 psychological mark.</p>
