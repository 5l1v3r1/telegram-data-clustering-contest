      <h1>Welsh darts star Gerwyn Price has an unlikely fan in Hollywood A-list actor Matthew McConaughey</h1>
      <h2>Star of The Wolf of Wall Street delivers out of the blue thumbs-up for former Welsh rugby player turned darts ace Gerwyn Price</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:55:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Woolford</a></address>
      <p>Gerwyn Price's new found fame and fortune as a PDC darts star is attracting the attention of the Hollywood glitterati.</p>
      <p>The Welshman, who successfully defended his Grand Slam of Darts title with an emphatic 16-6 win over Peter Wright last weekend, has a new member of his growing fan club in American film star Matthew McConaughey.</p>
      <p>And the former Neath and Cross Keys hooker could well find the A-lister, whose list of film credits includes Tropic Thunder, The Wedding Planner, The Lincoln Lawyer and The Wolf of Wall Street, roaring him on after the PDC announced their World Series will land at Madison Square Garden, New York in June next year.</p>
      <p>The news came on the day McConaughey gave a shout out to world number three Price after defending his Grand Slam of Darts title in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>The actor tweeted out: "Big ups to the Iceman, Gezzy Price for taking out MVG and the Eagle to win his second consecutive Grand Slam of Darts."</p>

      <p>Welshman Price produced a scintillating display against 'Snakebite' Wright in the final, ending the game with an average of 107.86, the second highest recorded in a final of the competition.</p>
      <p>He scooped Â£125,000 as a result of winning the event, a sum that sees him move up to a best position of third in the world rankings.</p>

      <p>Price won all seven of his matches in the competition.</p>
      <p>He qualified for the knockout stages by securing victories against Mikuru Suzuki, Robert Thornton and Dimitri Van den Bergh, with his 100% record seeing him finish at the top of his group.</p>
      <p>Price demolished Darren Webster 10-1 in the last-32 before beating nemesis Gary Anderson 16-9 in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>He created more history in the last four as he secured a 16-12 triumph against Michael van Gerwen, his first win against the current world number one.</p>
      <p>And his success over Scot Wright saw him become only the third player in history to defend the Grand Slam title.</p>
      <p>Clearly the triumph reached parts Price would not have expected, judging by McConaughey's unexpected social media post.</p>
      <p>Price's previous sport of rugby saw him feature in the Welsh Premiership for Neath and Cross Keys, as well as South Wales Scorpions rugby league team.</p>
      <p>He also had a brief spell in the PRO12 with Glasgow Warriors, before quitting rugby in 2014 to concentrate on becoming a full-time darts player.</p>
