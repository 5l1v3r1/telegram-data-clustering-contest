      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harrison-ford/">Harrison Ford</a> is set to make his long-awaited return to the small screen after a 26-year absence.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/harrison-ford-the-staircase-series-1203411141/">Variety</a>, Ford is currently attached to the upcoming TV adaptation of the 2004 French docu-series <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/08/staircase-review-netflixs-new-additions-much-loved-true-crime-saga-gripping-ever-7615793/">The Staircase</a>.</p>
      <p>The true crime series, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/07/will-second-series-staircase-7690981/">which gained renewed prominence upon its release on Netflix last year</a>, details the trial of novelist Michael Peterson, who was accused of murdering his wife Kathleen Peterson in December 2001.</p>
      <p>The author claimed at the time that Kathleen died after falling down a set of stairs in their home, but police accused him of staging her fall after he bludgeoned her to death.</p>

      <p>Michael Peterson, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 after being found guilty in what was one of the longest trials in North Carolina history.</p>

      <p>He was later released in 2017 on time served after submitting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/30/novelist-convicted-for-wifes-murder-says-netflix-series-helped-him-walk-free-7672821/">an Alford plea</a> to reduce his charge to manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Peterson’s case will be dramatised in the upcoming series, which is currently being shopped to streaming services and TV networks and is being executively produced by Ford.</p>
      <p>It’s not yet clear what acting role Ford will have in The Staircase, but his involvement will end his long exile from TV.</p>
