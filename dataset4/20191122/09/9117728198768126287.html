      <h1>Russell: "Incredibly knowledgeable" Kubica will be missed at Williams</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> rookie <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a> has revealed he will greatly miss his current teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a>, as the Pole will leave the side after the 2019 season to make room for a different driver.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russell and Kubica formed a brand-new line-up for the Grove-based team ahead of this season. It turned out to be a very difficult year for Williams, accruing just one point in the first 20 points as Kubica finished 10th in Germany. Well, he finished 12th but got bumped up following a disqualification for both Alfa Romeo cars as they had illegal mapping on their clutch.</p>

      <p>Kubica, a one-time Grand Prix winner back in 2008, came back to F1 after an eight-year absence following his horror-crash in 2011. It's not been the fairy tale comeback for him he would've wanted, however, getting massively out-driven by Russell on most occasions.</p>
      <p>The reigning Formula 2 champion Russell will still greatly miss his 34-year-old teammate, who has yet to announce what he'll be doing in 2020.</p>
      <p><i>"I have a great relationship with Robert," </i>the 21-year-old was quoted by <a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/22/russell-will-miss-funny-knowledgeable-kubica/"><i>RaceFans.net</i></a>. <i>"We get along well."</i></p>
      <p>Despite Russell having put in the better performances by quite a long way, out-qualifying Kubica on all 20 occasions so far, the two have maintained a very healthy relationship in a bid to get Williams closer to other constructors.</p>

      <p><i>“He’s an incredibly funny guy,"</i> the Brit continued.<i> "He’s incredibly knowledgeable on the technical side. And I learned a lot [from] how he deals with the engineers and the feedback he gives. It showed me there was more I need to improve to be more of a complete driver.”</i></p>
      <p>Russell, who equalled Stoffel Vandoorne's record by winning seven races in his debut season in F2, will likely be paired by Nicholas Latifi in 2020.</p>
