      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eden-hazard/">Eden Hazard</a> has admitted he was overweight when he joined <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsene-wenger/">Arsene Wenger</a> said his physical fitness was one of the reasons the Chelsea hero struggled at his new club.</p>
      <p>Belgian superstar Hazard won two Premier League titles, two Europa Leagues, the FA Cup and EFL Cup during his hugely successful seven-year spell at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old completed a dream move to Real Madrid in the summer, however, with the Spanish giants spending over £100million to secure his signature from Premier League club Chelsea.</p>

      <p>Hazard endured a sluggish start to his career at the Bernabeu, taking six appearances to register his first Real Madrid goal, and Wenger <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/arsene-wenger-claims-eden-hazard-overweight-real-madrid-11054282/">felt his underwhelming performances were a result of weight gain over the summer</a>.</p>

      <p>Asked whether he put on weight before joining Real Madrid, Hazard told L’Equipe: ‘It’s true. I’m not going to hide it, but when I’m on vacation, I’m on vacation.</p>
      <p>‘I had put on five kilos, I’m the type to put on quickly and lose so quickly if I’m careful.</p>
      <p>‘When I was 18, in Lille, I was 72 or 73 kg. Muscle mass was 75 kg, on a bad day, 77 kg. I was 80 kg this summer, I lost it in 10 days.’</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier in the month, Arsenal legend Wenger said Hazard had arrived at Real Madrid ‘too heavy’ and would take time to rediscover his top form.</p>
      <p>‘I think it was more down to physical reasons,’ Wenger said. ‘He came too heavy, like we read in the papers.</p>

      <p>‘If you want to make a horse lose a race, putting two kilos on a horse of 500 kilos is enough.’</p>
      <p>Hazard has begun to make a bigger impact under Zinedine Zidane and has revealed how he turned his poor form around for Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I was not good, simply. I said to myself ‘start playing well’. The first two months, in what I was proposing, it was not enough.</p>

      <p>‘I thought, I can do better, I’ve felt better for a month now. I dribble, I accelerate and I try to make others play well.</p>
      <p>‘I do not do everything right but I try The first two months, I said to myself ‘you’re new, be simple’. Too many passes, people waited for me to dribble.’</p>
      <p>Hazard scored a brace for Belgium during the international break and will hope to help Real Madrid defeat La Liga rivals Real Sociedad on Saturday.</p>
