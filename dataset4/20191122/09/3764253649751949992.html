      <p>While most of the spotlight is shone on cases of domestic violence, abusive relationships continue to take on different forms that more often than not, leave the victims broken.</p>
      <p>A Nigerian man identified as Victor O Cheedoh recently left many people shocked after he took to the Facebook platform to reveal how his own sister constantly abuses him verbally. He shared screenshots of text messages from her in which she constantly insults him.</p>
      <p>He wrote: <i>"Someone called me a useless responsible ingrate eating like a starved dog also a disrespectful untrained fatherless human being. Apparently all I do is sleep, smoke and drink to stupor. Oh and I’m a disappointment as well. To cut the long tale short.</i></p>

      <p>Meanwhile, while many parents have their children's interest at heart before many other things and will go to any lengths to protect them, it appears there are some who have a rather unorthodox way of showing it.</p>
      <p>Such is reflected in the story of a lady <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1269211-mom-daughter-arrested-walk-abusive-marriage.html">who left her abusive husband but paid dearly for it with the help of her own mother.</a> Twitter user @Mz_Tosyn shared the story on the platform. According to her, the mother found the daughter and got her beaten by the said abusive husband and eventually had her arrested.</p>
