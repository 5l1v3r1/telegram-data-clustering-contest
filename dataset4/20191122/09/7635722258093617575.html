        <b>Electric car-maker Tesla has unveiled its long-awaited pickup truck.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ‘Cybertruck’ aims to take a slice of America’s most lucrative car market – with production due to begin in late 2021.</p>
      <p>Designed to “have the utility of a truck and the performance of a sports car,” the vehicle packs a huge amount of power with a towing capacity of 14,000lbs – and is capable of accelerating from 0 to 95kph in 6.5 seconds.</p>
      <p>It will have a starting price on $39,900 (€36,000) and a maximum range of over 500 miles per charge.</p>

      <p>“We need sustainable energy now,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during the unveiling.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t have a pickup truck we can’t solve it. The top three selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks.</p>
      <p>“To solve sustainable energy we have to have a pickup truck.”</p>

      <p>It is the cars angular design that will have car-lovers talking however. Partly inspired by James Bond's submarine car in The Spy Who Loved Me, the vehicle looks like something out of a 1970s sci-fi novel.</p>
      <p>It was greeted with cheers during its livestream unveiling; however, there have been many bemused reactions on social media.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, an attempt to demonstrate the strength of the Cybertruck’s “armour glass” window went badly wrong when two shattered on stage.</p>
      <p>The windows, designed to withstand bullets and sledgehammers smashed after metal balls were thrown at them.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk admitted there was “room for improvement” in the design.</p>
      <p>He said the windows didn’t break under strong testing before the unveiling and said the company would investigate what went wrong.</p>
