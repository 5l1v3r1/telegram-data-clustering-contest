      <h1>Prince Andrew cancels Bahrain business trip over Epstein scandal</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> is believed to have cancelled a weekend trip to Bahrain in the wake of his ‘car crash’ interview over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York was expected to travel to the Middle East on Saturday but has reportedly cancelled the trip due to mounting pressure from the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/royal-family/">Royal Family</a>.</p>
      <p>Andrew was due to meet with business leaders as part of his Pitch@Palace project for tech entrepreneurs – one of the few ventures he continues to work on as it is private and ‘separate from the palace’.</p>
      <p>The cancelled trip comes after the duke <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/queen-gives-prince-andrew-permission-step-back-public-duties-epstein-links-11190989/">announced on Wednesday</a> that he would step down from his royal duties ‘for the foreseeable future’.</p>
      <p>In an unprecedented move, the royal met the Queen to seek her permission, as it was ‘clear’ his relationship with the disgraced financier was causing ‘disruption to my family’s work’.</p>

      <p>He wrote to his mother after receiving a huge backlash from his interview, for which he has been criticised of showing no empathy for Epstein’s victims nor remorse over his relationship with the paedophile.</p>

      <p>It is also reported that Buckingham Palace was disturbed by the mention of Andrew’s relationship with Epstein in the ITV election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Senior aides and the Prince of Wales advised the Queen that Andrew should be withdrawn from public life, after concerns the scandal was overshadowing the democratic process, said <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrew-election-fears-made-charles-call-for-duke-to-be-removed-39xfn0ntn">The Times</a>.</p>
      <p>On Friday, his brother Prince Charles ignored a question from a reporter in New Zealand about whether the duke should speak to US investigators.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7712625/Royal-Family-step-force-Prince-Andrew-cancel-junket-Bahrain.html">Daily Mail</a>, the prince’s private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, was removed from her palace-funded role on Thursday and will instead become the chief executive of Pitch.</p>
      <p>Ms Thirsk – believed to have been the driving force behind Andrew’s ‘nuclear level bad’ Newsnight interview – will now run the business mentorship scheme, reported the paper.</p>

      <p>She will also manage the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award, after the prince stepped down from his role at several charities,  organisations and military units, including the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-steps-huddersfield-university-chancellor-epstein-links-11196085/">University of Huddersfield</a> and the Outward Bound Trust.</p>

      <p>In the past few days, multimillion-pound businesses, charities and more than 20 companies, including Barclays, KPMG and the English National Ballet, have distanced themselves from the Prince following his BBC interview last Saturday.</p>
      <p>By Thursday, two organisations had severed ties with him, and a sponsor of Pitch@Palace said Andrew’s plans to continue leading it were ‘not tenable’.</p>
      <p>The Outward Bound Trust, which Andrew has supported for decades, accepted his resignation as patron, and Huddersfield University confirmed the duke would be relinquishing his role as its chancellor.</p>
      <p>Andrew will be scaling down his public work from now on, but it is not clear if his finances will change, as he is supported by his mother and her help will never be disclosed.</p>
      <p>During the Newsnight interview, the duke denied claims he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage.</p>
      <p>He said he did not regret his friendship with disgraced financier Epstein, who took his own life while in prison earlier this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p>
