      <h2>Next week a short stretch of Kingsway will be closed for two or three days.</h2>

      <p>Rockview Road, which was badly damaged by the April storm, was re-opened to traffic this morning (Friday, 22 November). Leomat site foreman, Brendan Roux said they decided to open the road in the morning to ensure any teething problems could be addressed before staff finished work at noon.</p>
      <p>Next week a short stretch of Kingsway will be closed for two or three days, but the temporary access road will remain open to save motorists from an extended detour. The temporary road will then be dug up and all the rubble and equipment removed to allow the rehabilitation of the park to get underway.</p>
      <p>Three drains from Boundary Lane into George Glendennen that were damaged by trucks were replaced with heavy duty drains.</p>
