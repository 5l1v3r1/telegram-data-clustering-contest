        <b>Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) was abused by Kel Hinchley (Joe Alessi) when he was a teenager in Coronation Street, and — although <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billy-mayhew/">Billy Mayhew</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-brocklebank/">Daniel Brocklebank</a>) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/coronation-street-spoilers-billy-mayhew-and-paul-foreman-are-official-as-the-truth-about-kels-sexual-abuse-is-revealedh-10957698/">knows the truth</a> — the rest of his family haven’t a clue. However, the truth comes to light in tonight’s episodes, when Paul finds himself with little choice but to reveal all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Viewers will have seen cobbles residents becoming agitated over the last couple of episodes about a string of burglaries which have taken place in the surrounding area. Billy tweaked on rather quickly that the addresses of those who were burgled are listed in his diary — which has conveniently gone missing.</p>
      <p>With Bernie (Jane Hazelgrove) having started working in the church the day his diary went missing, Billy was quick to point the finger — as did Gemma (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dolly-rose-campbell/">Dolly-Rose Campbell</a>) and Paul when they discovered a stash of stolen goods in the cupboard under the stairs.</p>

      <p>The pair kicked their mum out, but tonight they begin to think that they might’ve been somewhat hasty in doing so, and thus they apologise to her. After doing some deliberating, they realise that evil Kel also had access to the diary and thus they put two and two together.</p>

      <p>As a result, Gemma and Bernie decide to break into Kel’s flat and they’re left shocked by what they find. Yes, they stumble upon not only Daniel’s (Rob Mallard) laptop — which viewers will know went missing on the day of Sinead’s (Katie McGlynn) funeral — but also a pile of old photos of Paul — and some other children too.</p>
      <p>Bernie and Gemma <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/coronation-street-spoilers-kel-exposed-as-a-paedophile-10957632/">return home with the laptop and photos in hand</a> — much to Paul’s dismay.</p>
      <p>However, he soon opens up, as he reveals that Kel sexually abused him.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Bernie and Gemma are stunned.</p>
      <p>Will they confront Kel?</p>
      <p>We know there’s going to be some <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/coronation-street-spoilers-paedophile-kel-holds-bernie-hostage-sex-crimes-exposed-11176296/">big scenes coming up between Kel and Bernie</a>, so a confrontation will ensue act some point.</p>
