      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:59:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/africa/364589-zimbabwe-sacks-435-doctors-over-strike.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Zimbabwean government on Friday said it has so far fired 435 junior doctors at public hospitals for engaging in an illegal strike.</p>
      <p>The doctors have been on strike since early September to demand better pay and improved working conditions.</p>
      <p>The Labor Court in October declared the strike illegal, but the doctors have been defiant and continued with the strike, paralysing operations at major public health institutions in the country.</p>
      <p>The Health Service Board has 45 more disciplinary cases to handle for the doctors.</p>
      <p>Acting information minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu told reporters at a news briefing that the government has always been open to dialogue with the doctors and that firing them was a last resort. (Xinhua/NAN)</p>
