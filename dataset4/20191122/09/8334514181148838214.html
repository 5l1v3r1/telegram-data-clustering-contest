      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is making a push to develop high-tech military hardware that would give it control over critical defense capabilities and lessen reliance on imports.</p>

      <p>Wary of threats from rival Iran, and concerned over moves by some allies to hold up arms sales, the UAE is reshaping a military industry already seen as the region’s most sophisticated.</p>
      <p>State defense companies have been brought together to form EDGE, a $5-billion conglomerate to spearhead development of advanced weapons for the country’s military.</p>
      <p>Those ambitions were put on display at this week’s Dubai Airshow where the military handed an EDGE company a $1 billion contract for guided missiles.</p>
      <p>“Like many countries, on specific critical capabilities you want to have sovereignty,” EDGE Chief Executive Faisal al-Bannai told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The UAE’s defense industry dates back two decades, built through joint ventures and technology transfer programs.</p>
      <p>Much of it now sits under EDGE, manufacturing drones, small ammunitions and providing maintenance.</p>
      <p>Despite close ties with the West, the oil-rich Gulf nation has had difficulty acquiring some sophisticated weapons.</p>
      <p>The United States will not sell armed drones to the UAE under a longstanding export policy limiting their use. Recently, some European countries have blocked sales to the UAE over its involvement in the Yemen war.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the UAE maintains close ties and continues to buy weapons from China and Russia.</p>
      <p>Abdulla al-Hashimi, assistant undersecretary for support services at the UAE ministry of defense, said sovereign capabilities were a “necessity” for security and the economy.</p>
      <h3>EMERGING THREATS</h3>
      <p>A series of attacks in the Gulf over the summer, blamed on Iran by the United States, highlighted new threats to the security of Gulf states. Tehran denied involvement.</p>
      <p>Oil tankers off the UAE coast were sabotaged and a swarm of missiles and drones temporarily wiped out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production in a September attack.</p>
      <p>EDGE could develop directed energy technology, Bannai said, which can be used to counter drone threats.</p>
      <p>Directed energy weapons emit focused energy in the form of lasers, microwaves, electromagnetic radiation, radio waves, sound or particle beams.</p>
      <p>“The Emiratis not only believe that they can make a profit in this sphere but also that they are well-equipped to understand and counter regional threats,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a resident scholar at the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.</p>
      <p>The UAE is expected to spend $17 billion on defense next year, according to U.S.-based defense analysis firm Teal, up from $14.4 billion in 2014 when last disclosed by the government. Today, just a fraction is spent domestically.</p>
      <p>Abu Dhabi, the main petroleum producing emirate, is leading the development of the country’s industry.</p>
      <p>There, the move is seen as a step not only toward more diversification of an oil-based economy but toward “greater strategic autonomy with regards to foreign and defense policies,” said Jean-Loup Samaan, associate professor at the UAE National Defense College.</p>

      <p>EDGE, which wants to build on joint ventures that developed the country’s defense industry, also has eyes on exporting.</p>
      <p>That could draw new scrutiny.</p>
      <p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs R. Clarke Cooper said Washington would like the UAE to establish greater oversight as it develops its military industry.</p>
