      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/victoria-beckham/">Victoria Beckham</a> is all about Keeping Up With The Kardashians as she partied with Kim and Kourtney on Thursday.</p>
      <p>And we’re not at all jealous of the whole thing…</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the 45-year-old shared a snap of herself posing with reality royalty as they commemorated her latest VB Beauty launch.</p>
      <p>‘So much fun celebrating the launch of my new @augustinusbader @victoriabeckhambeauty Priming Moisturizer with @kourtneykardash @kimkardashian @violetgrey x Kisses VB,’ she captioned the shot.</p>
      <p>Thanks for the invite, hun.</p>
      <p>The Posh Spice singer was the very definition of chic as she rocked a crisp white suit, with black shoes.</p>
      <p>Side note: We would’ve spilled rose and seven canapés all over that blazer way before the picture was taken…</p>

      <p>While Kim opted for an off-the-shoulder black velvet dress coupled with matching boots for the bash, and Kourtney also got the all-black memo in a long overcoat and PVC boots.</p>

      <p>Right on cue, fans went into total meltdown over the snap which, let’s be honest, should probably be printed out and displayed in a museum.</p>
      <p>‘Power women I love it,’ one commented, as another agreed: ‘This is. THE best photo.’</p>
      <p>While an Instagram user asked the question on all our minds: ‘How do we get into this girl gang?’</p>
      <p>Over to you, VB…</p>

      <p>Victoria has pretty much conquered the world, thanks to her turn in the Spice Girls, starting up her own fashion label and recently moving over into the beauty industry.</p>
      <p>Basically, she’s total goals.</p>
      <p>But the singer – who shares four children with husband David Beckham – revealed she’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/victoria-beckham-proud-good-mother-admits-fame-can-great-11085829/">most proud of being a good mum to their brood</a>, Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper.</p>
      <p>During a chat with Vogue, she opened up on fame, admitting her ‘two most important roles’ are being a mum and running her own business.</p>
      <p>‘I think if you are famous and you can use that for a good cause, if you can use that and use your voice in a positive way, then I think fame is great,’ she told the publication.</p>
      <p>‘If I can inspire anybody to just follow their dreams, however many times you’re told “No”, then that’s my job done.’</p>
