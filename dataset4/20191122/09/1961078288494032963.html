      <h1>Under U.S. Pressure, South Korea Stays in Intelligence Pact With Japan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:08:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author">Motoko Rich and Edward Wong</a></address>
      <p>TOKYO — Under intense pressure from the United States, South Korea reversed itself at the last minute Friday and extended an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, a sign that the Seoul government wanted to halt fraying relations with the two countries.</p>
      <p>The decision to remain in the intelligence pact, which South Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/world/asia/south-korea-japan-intelligence.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline">had vowed to abandon just three months ago, </a>appeared to be at least a short-term victory for Trump administration officials. They pressed to preserve the pact, and have been angered over an impasse with South Korea in a separate dispute over the costs of maintaining American troops in the country as a deterrent to North Korea.</p>
      <p>South Korea’s decision also came as a bitter trade dispute with Japan showed signs of easing. Taken together, both developments suggested that President Moon Jae-in of South Korea was looking for ways to de-escalate underlying historical tensions, which have caused one of the most serious rifts between the two countries since they normalized relations 54 years ago.</p>
      <p>The moves came on the eve of a Group of 20 meeting of foreign ministers in Nagoya, Japan, appearing to set the tone for improvement in a three-way alliance with the United States and Japan that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/world/asia/japan-south-korea-feud.html?module=inline">has been increasingly strained</a>.</p>
      <p>American officials have attached great importance to the alliance as a principal way for the United States to exert its influence in Asia, particularly because of China’s rapidly expanding military and economic footprints.</p>
      <p>South Korea had been set to quit the intelligence-sharing pact after 11:59 p.m. Friday. Just hours before the deadline, officials decided to halt the withdrawal, for now.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration had been pressuring Mr. Moon to remain in the pact, which is regarded as an important tool in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/asia/trump-asia-strategy.html?module=inline">monitoring the missile and nuclear weapons activities of </a>North Korea — still in a technical state of war with the United States and South Korea after nearly seven decades.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Mr. Trump has been demanding that Mr. Moon contribute much more to the expense of keeping more than 28,000 American troops deployed in South Korea, which he has described as “$5 billion of protection.” On Tuesday American negotiators in Seoul took a hard approach by breaking off talks on that issue.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether the American move directly contributed to Seoul’s reversal on the intelligence-sharing pact. But the extension of the pact will help Seoul improve relations with Washington and Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Officials in the administration of Mr. Moon emphasized that the decision on the pact, known as the General Security of Military Information Agreement or G.S.O.M.I.A., could change depending on negotiations with Japan. “We made our decision on the premise that we can terminate G.S.O.M.I.A. any time,” said Kim You-geun, deputy director of South Korea’s National Security Council.</p>
      <p>Just one day earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had made a renewed effort in Washington to persuade Tokyo and Seoul to work out a deal, as the deadline for leaving the agreement loomed.</p>
      <p>He spoke by telephone with Kang Kyung-wha, the foreign minister of South Korea, formally known as the Republic of Korea, and the two “pledged to maintain close coordination and reaffirmed the importance of the ROK-Japan relationship,” according to the State Department.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pompeo and Ms. Kang also “praised the enduring strength of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and both sides reiterated their commitment to cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,” the State Department said in a statement summarizing the phone call.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper visited Seoul and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/asia/south-korea-japan-intelligence-sharing.html?module=inline">publicly exhorted</a> his South Korean counterpart to stay in the pact.</p>
      <p>Mr. Esper has also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-usa-talks-esper/u-s-says-south-korea-can-do-more-on-costs-after-talks-break-down-idUSKBN1XT0QS">pressed Seoul</a> to increase its payments to maintain the troops. “South Korea is a wealthy country,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/11/19/world/asia/19reuters-southkorea-usa-talks.html?module=inline">said</a> Tuesday while on a trip to the Philippines, according to Reuters. “They can and should contribute more.”</p>
      <p>American troops are stationed in South Korea and a small number help patrol the edge of a demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. The Korean War, in which the United States fought with South Korea against North Korea and China, was halted with an armistice in 1953, but has never been formally ended.</p>
      <p>Japanese officials had also encouraged South Korea to make a “wise decision” and remain in the intelligence-sharing agreement.</p>
      <p>South Korea’s decision came as Japan announced that it would resume negotiations with South Korea over export controls. Tokyo had imposed trade restrictions on shipments of certain products to South Korea and had removed it from a list of favored trading partners as the tensions escalated.</p>
      <p>But Yoichi Iida, a Japanese trade official, insisted on Friday that the trade and intelligence sharing developments were not linked.</p>
      <p>“We did not compromise,” he said.</p>
      <p>Analysts said Seoul’s decision seemed to signal a strengthening of the United States’ role in diplomacy in the region after a long period in which the Trump administration had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/world/asia/japan-south-korea-feud.html?module=inline">failed in repairing the rift</a> between its two East Asian allies, or even getting them to freeze hostilities.</p>
      <p>“The South Korean government was pushed hard by the United States government, especially the professionals” in the State and Defense Departments, said Lully Miura, the chief executive of the Yamaneko Research Institute in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Washington strongly supports the agreement as a pillar of stability in the region. Intelligence sharing between Japan and South Korea allows both countries to swap information about North Korean missile launches as well as military actions by China, which is expanding its footprint in the surrounding seas and which the United States considers its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/asia/usa-china-trade-pacific.html?module=inline">greatest challenger for supremacy in Asia</a>.</p>
      <p>“The G.S.O.M.I.A. is a critical tool that allows Seoul and Tokyo to work together on a host of shared security challenges,” said <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/abraham-denmark">Abraham M. Denmark</a>, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia when the agreement was signed in 2016 and is now Asia program director at the Wilson Center in Washington.</p>
      <p>“That both Seoul and Tokyo have agreed to stay in the G.S.O.M.I.A., despite significant political pressure at home, demonstrates the agreement’s real importance. A good decision by both sides, and a much-needed success for the United States after a string of setbacks.”</p>
      <p>Current and former American officials familiar with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/world/asia/south-korea-japan-intelligence.html?module=inline">intelligence-sharing agreement</a> said its implementation was still in the early stages. Once the infrastructure and protocols are in place to make the agreement work, the two nations, in theory, would be able to coordinate on intelligence on critical security matters in Asia.</p>
      <p>Without the agreement, both nations need the American military to act as a go-between for coordinating on intelligence, American officials say.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan described South Korea’s decision on Friday as “strategic” in view of the need to cooperate “to take measures against North Korea.”</p>
      <p>Seoul’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/world/asia/south-korea-japan-intelligence.html?module=inline">decision in August</a> to leave the pact came as disagreements with deep historical roots flared with Japan, severely straining ties.</p>
      <p>South Korea accused Japan of imposing export controls as a way of pressuring South Korea to resolve outstanding disputes over the legacy of Japan’s occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Seoul responded with its own trade actions against Tokyo, before sending the tensions to a peak by announcing its intention to leave the military agreement.</p>
      <p>At the time, Mr. Kim, of South Korea’s National Security Council, said the trade restrictions imposed by Japan had “caused an important change in security-related cooperation between the two countries,” adding that staying in the pact “does not conform with our national interest.”</p>
      <p>Friday’s decision by South Korea and Japan’s call to resume trade talks indicated that both sides wished to cool tensions.</p>
      <p>“At least it shows that both sides understand that they were heading toward a cliff and that once they jumped off there was no going back,” said <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/daniel_c_sneider">Daniel C. Sneider, </a>a lecturer in international policy at Stanford University. “It doesn’t mean that there is any fundamental solution here. That still requires a fair bit of statesmanship and leadership on the part of both governments.”</p>
      <p>Ken Jimbo, a professor of international relations at Keio University in Tokyo, said that the last-minute decision, orchestrated with competing news conferences in Seoul and Tokyo, showed “a lot of Kabuki theater going on here,” but that it at least demonstrated that both sides were ready to negotiate.</p>
