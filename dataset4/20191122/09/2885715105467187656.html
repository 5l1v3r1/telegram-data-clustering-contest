      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:19:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/shyna-kalra/" target="_blank">Shyna Kalra</a></address>
      <p>Jaipur’s Mayank Pratap Singh is all set to become the youngest judge in the country at the age of 21 after topping the Rajasthan Judicial Services (RJS) examination. He scored 169 marks out of 300 in the Mains exam and scored 28 out of 35 in the interview round to obtain the first rank and is awaiting the document verification round as of now.</p>
      <p>While the states including Delhi, Haryana and Gujarat among others already have 21-year-olds appearing for their respective judicial services exams, none in the age bracket has made it through yet. This was the first time that<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/jobs/rjs-2017-rajasthan-high-court-challenges-rule-on-minimum-age-criteria-issues-notice/"> Rajasthan relaxed the lower age limit</a> to appear for the RJS exam from 23 to 21 years.</p>
      <p>Talking to <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a></i>, Singh said that while he was expecting to crack the exam, the top rank surprised him. “My exams had gone well and I was expecting to get through but I had never thought that I would get the top rank. I am the first one in my family to pursue law as a profession. It was tough to manage the preparation for the exam as well as finish my graduation along with it.” He has completed LLB from University of Rajasthan, Jaipur.</p>
      <p>Singh said that he used to devote 10 hours a day to the judicial services’ preparation. “It is the combination of both hard work and smart work that helped me crack the exams. I used to wake up early in the morning and studied for a couple of hours before the day started. Since I did not opt for any coaching classes and it was nearly a year-long process (including prelims, mains followed by interview), it was difficult to stay motivated throughout. Thus, I prepared a schedule and stuck to it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mayank had passed high school in science stream with physics, mathematics and chemistry as his subjects and was asked to appear for IIT entrance exams by his relatives. “Since I had PCM in class 11 and 12, many people asked me to give it a shot at JEE but I was inspired to pursue law in my higher studies. My parents were very supportive and supported me in my decision,” said the son of government school teachers.</p>
      <p>During the interview round, he was asked about the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sabarimala-temple/">Sabarimala</a> and Ayodhya verdicts of the Supreme Court. “The environment during the interview was very conducive. The panel consisted of High Court judges and field experts. I was asked several questions ranging from conventional laws to practices followed to SC verdicts on Sabarimala and  Ayodhya. The review on Sabrimala came a day before my interview and I had read about it in the papers, hence, I was able to answer these questions,” said the topper.</p>
      <p>Mayank is an avid reader and draws motivation by reading autobiographies of famous personalities across fields. He wishes to inspire and empower people in his role as a judge. “A judge should show integrity and be impartial. He should have the physical and mental strength to avoid any kind of influence. As a judge, I wish to serve people and instil the faith that everyone who knocks at the door of law will get justice.”</p>
      <p>On becoming the youngest ever to crack the exam, he said, “Youngsters of my age are very distracted, be it because of social media or peer pressure. If they focus their energies on their goals, they can set higher goals for themselves.” Mayank is not on any social media platform barring Instagram which he deactivated during exam preparations.</p>
