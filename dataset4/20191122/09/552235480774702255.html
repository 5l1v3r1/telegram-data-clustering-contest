      <p>West Lothian Community Planning Partners are organising the proceedings and West Lothian Violence Against Women and Girls Partnership are leading the campaign, which runs from November 22 to December 10.</p>
      <p>A series of multi-agency events have also been arranged during the 18 days, including training sessions, awareness-raising stalls and screening of the film Paper Tigers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>West Lothian Council Leader Lawrence Fitzpatrick said: “West Lothian is proud to support the 18 Days of Action Campaign against domestic violence against women and children.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully as many people as possible are able to make it along to Friday’s march. In West Lothian we are committed to ensuring our communities are safe places, offering improved life chances for all and a better quality of life for everyone.”</p>
      <p>Chair of the West Lothian Community Planning Partnership and Depute Council Leader Kirsteen Sullivan said: “Violence against women is a violation of human rights and a criminal offence and it’s vital we do all we can to make sure this doesn’t take place in West Lothian.</p>
      <p>“Events are taking place all over the world to tackle the issue, and locally, partner agencies are committed to working together towards our shared goal challenging and eliminating violence against women and girls from our society. I would encourage as many people as possible to come along to Friday morning’s march to show their support.”</p>
      <p>Help is available for anyone experience gender based violence or domestic abuse through the specialists in the council’s Domestic and Sexual Assault Team (DASAT) and West Lothian Women’s Aid (WLWA).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ilena Brown, Manager of West Lothian Women’s Aid said: “This is a welcome opportunity to raise awareness of domestic abuse and encourage anyone in need of support to come forward.</p>
      <p>“Domestic abuse between partners or former partners is characterised by a pattern of controlling and coercive behaviour over time intended to cause fear and alarm. The abuse can include physical, emotional, financial and/or sexual abuse for which there is no place within today’s society.”</p>
