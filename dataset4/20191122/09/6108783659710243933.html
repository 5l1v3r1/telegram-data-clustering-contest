      <h1>Microsoft “in talks” for Project xCloud exclusive games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:29:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wright</a></address>
      <h3>Microsoft has also added new APIs to the Xbox SDK to make it easier to develop games intended for streaming.</h3>
      <p>Microsoft is “in talks” with first- and third-party studios to create and release <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud</a> exclusive games.</p>
      <p>Microsoft’s Kareem Choudhry made the confirmation at X019 in London as part of a group interview with Australian outlets, stressing that there weren’t any title-specific announcements to make at this time.</p>
      <p>“In terms of [Project xCloud] exclusives, we’re in early talks with first- and third- parties, but we don’t have any announcements to share,” Choudhry asserted. “New content and IP takes eighteen months to two years [to develop].”</p>
      <p>Choudry stressed that “the first thing that we’re doing is… just lifting and shifting content that doesn’t require any development changes into the cloud. So right away we’ve got a platform that can run any of the 3000 games you can run on Xbox today.”</p>
      <p>Choudhry also confirmed that specific APIs have been added to the Xbox SDK to let a game “know at runtime [if it is] being streamed or not.”</p>
      <p>Calling the functionality “cloud aware,” Choudhry said the APIs enable developers “to make any changes that they want, specific to streaming — things like changing the font sizes or… changing some of their networking code to account for the fact that the server is in a data center.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud</a> is in an active trial in the UK, the US and Korea. The preview program <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/project-xcloud-heads-canada-india-japan-2020/">will extend to more regions</a> — and <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/project-xcloud-heads-to-pc-other-devices-in-2020/">more devices</a> — in 2020.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Microsoft has contacted Stevivor with a request to clarify its position on xCloud after the X019 interview, and now says it isn’t working on xCloud exclusive content.</p>
      <p>“We are investigating a variety of new capabilities made possible by the cloud,” a statement from a Microsoft spokesperson reads. “However, we remain committed to an approach with game streaming that is complementary to console and have no plans for cloud-exclusive content at this time.”</p>
