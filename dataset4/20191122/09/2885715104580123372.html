      <h1>After 5 years, Ram Ki Baraat rolls out from Ayodhya</h1>
      <h2>The procession, that comprised two raths — carrying idols of Ram, Lakshman and Bharat as well as religious leaders from Ayodhya along with artists and followers — will reach Janakpur on November 28.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:22:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/maulshree-seth/" target="_blank">Maulshree Seth</a></address>
      <p>The Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders and religious leaders on Thursday flagged off the procession, Ram ki Baaraat, with much pomp and show from Karsewakpuram in Ayodhya for Janakpur in Nepal, the place to which Sita belonged.</p>
      <p>The procession, that comprised two raths — carrying idols of Ram, Lakshman and Bharat as well as religious leaders from Ayodhya along with artists and followers — will reach Janakpur on November 28. After different functions, the marriage of Ram and Sita will be celebrated on December 1 there.</p>
      <p>The procession will return to Ayodhya on December 4.</p>
      <p>The procession was flagged off with an aarti by Ramjanmabhumi Nyas chairman Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, amid chants of “Jai Siya Ram”.</p>
      <p>“It is a traditional programme. This marriage procession of Ram is taken out every five years from here to Nepal. It is a happy coincidence that this year the Supreme Court has given judgment in favour of Ram Lalla, and soon a magnificent temple will be built here,” said Rishikesh Upadhyaya, Ayodhya Mayor, who was also present, when the procession left Karsewakpuram.</p>
      <p>From Ayodhya, the marriage procession of Ram will travel through Ambedkar Nagar and Azamgarh districts in Uttar Pradesh and then pass through several districts in Bihar, including <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/buxar-lok-sabha-election-results/">Buxar</a>, Patna, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/sitamarhi-lok-sabha-election-results/">Sitamarhi</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/darbhanga-lok-sabha-election-results/">Darbhanga</a> and Motihari, before entering Janakpur on November 28.</p>
      <p>The next day, a ‘tilokotsava’ has been organised for Ram at Dasharath temple in Janakpur. On November 30, there will be ‘Kanya pujan’, whereas the actual marriage celebrations will be organised at Janki temple on December 1. A “<a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/dhanush/">Dhanush</a> Yagya” as well as presentation of “Jaimal ki leela” will be performed by the artists, who are part of the procession. The VHP will also organise a mass marriage for 108 underprivileged couples in Janakpuri.</p>
      <p>According to Upadhyaya, efforts are on to revive routes through which Ram had travelled to Janakpuri and said a foundation stone of such projects will be laid soon.</p>
      <p>National Secretary of VHP and also convener of “Ram ki Baaraat”, Rajendra Singh Pankaj, said the occasion is significant as there will be “dual celebrations”, including go-ahead for Ram temple construction. Singh, who will be travelling with the procession, said: “This baaraat has allowed people to express their happiness for two good things — the occasion to celebrate the journey of Ram from birth to marriage and nod for Ram Temple construction.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, VHP spokesperson in Ayodhya Sharad Sharma told <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a></i>, “Respecting the sentiments of Ram devotees, the concept of this baaraat was first started in 2004, and since then it is taken out once in every five years. Later, it was taken out in 2009 and then in 2014. This is the fourth time that this procession has been rolled out. This time, a mass marriage has also been organised.”</p>
