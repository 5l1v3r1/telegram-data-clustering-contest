      <h1>Tottenham fans react to Jesus Perez’s farewell tweet after midweek departure</h1>
      <h2>Perez was Tottenham’s assistant manager during the reign of Mauricio Pochettino.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:15:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was removed from his position as Tottenham manager during the international break, and Jose Mourinho’s swift appointment as his successor meant he didn’t have time to say goodbye to his squad.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one of the reasons for his downfall was that he had spent so long with the same group of players that his message went stale, but he had an incredible bond with the group he took to the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>And assistant manager Jesus Perez was part of the staff who also left the club along with the Argentine, a key part of the revolution that went on in north London since 2014.</p>
      <p>He posted an emotional Twitter message, sharing what he and the staff wrote on the whiteboard to share with his former players having been shunted out the exit door in double-quick time.</p>

      <p>So many Tottenham fans on Twitter were emotional in the aftermath of the post, which seemed to make them miss Perez and Pochettino even more.</p>
      <p>Amid the furore of Mourinho’s appointment, Spurs supporters haven’t had too much time to bemoan the loss of Pochettino, but the message just underlined the strength of the bond he and his staff had with the club.</p>
