        <b>Ademola Babalola, Ibadan</b>
      </p>
      <p>A legal luminary, Chief Afe Babalola, has advanced reasons why he turned down ministerial appointments twice.</p>
      <p>He explained that the type of civil servants in Nigeria was capable of making him have enemies if he had accepted the offer to serve as a minister.</p>
      <p>Speaking shortly after a dinner in celebration of the conferment of Honorary Doctor of Letters on him by the University of Ibadan , Babalola stated that none of the civil servants in the country could work the way he worked.</p>
      <p>The dinner was organised in his honour by lawyers in law firms of Emmanuel Chambers &amp; Co.</p>
      <p>The founder of the Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, said, “Well, I turned ministerial appointments down for two reasons.</p>
      <p>“One, I cannot work with the present type of civil servants in this country. The civil servants are the problems in this country. None of them can work the way I work. I will create instant enemies if I had accepted to be a minister.</p>
      <p>“The second reason is that my clients are so many. They protested and felt I would be disappointing them if I accepted to be a minister,” he explained.</p>
      <p>While admitting that Nigeria was a difficult country, Babalola, however, expressed hope, “despite the nation’s myriads of problems, especially with the renewed investment in education.”</p>
      <p>He stressed the importance of charity, adding that Nigerians did not like to give because everybody wanted the government to do everything.</p>
      <p>Babalola said UI had trained well over 300,000 people, including billionaires, yet the university could not boast of of N5bn in endowment.</p>
      <p>“Great universities in the world today depend not only on tuition fees but mostly on endowments and donations.</p>
      <p>In his welcome address, the Principal Partner, Afe Babalola &amp; Co, Mr. Adebayo Adenipekun, said the least they could do to appreciate the legal luminary was to organise the dinner.</p>
      <p>“I wish to assure you, sir, that the chambers is well and kicking and still fulfilling your ideals.</p>
      <p>“No matter how tempting the brief may be, we always ensure that we maintain the integrity of the chambers and would not go beyond the bounds of due process of law.</p>
      <p>“We are unperturbed by any disability we may suffer. We are determined to follow your footprints of honesty and integrity, ” he noted.</p>
      <p>Among the dignitaries present at the event were the Chief Judge of Oyo State, Justice Muktar Abimbola; Babalola’s wife Yeye Modupe Babalola; first female Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mrs. Folake Solanke; former ICPC Chairman, Justice Emmanuel Ayoola; Vice Chancellor, UI, Prof. Idowu Olayinka; Mr. Olu Daramola SAN, and the Executive Chairman, Safari Books Limited, Chief Joop Berkhout.</p>
