      <p>LOS ANGELES —A Philippine Airlines flight headed to Manila made an emergency landing Thursday shortly after leaving Los Angeles International Airport after its right engine apparently started shooting flames.</p>
      <p>Philippine Airlines Flight 113, a Boeing 777, landed without further incident at LAX about 11:50 a.m. after its flight crew reported a right-engine problem on departure, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
      <p>Videos posted to social media showed short bursts of flames coming from the plane’s right engine.</p>
      <p>“I could see flashes of light. I thought it was some kind of … just from the sunlight, and then I just start hearing ‘boom, boom, boom,’ and I look out of the window and there’s balls of fires just shooting out of the engine,” Walter Baumann, a passenger, told Los Angeles station KABC TV Channel 7.</p>
      <p>Philippine Airlines has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p>
