      <h1>Canada: Thieves Steal $4K From Bitcoin ATM, Leave $50K Untouched</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Two thieves at a Canadian grocery store swiped $4,000 from a Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) ATM but forgot to check the second canister, leaving $50,000 behind.</p>
      <p>According to a local media <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Vernon/270823/Vernon-grocery-store-thieves-break-into-bitcoin-ATM">report</a> published on Nov. 20, the robbery took place around 4 a.m. on Nov. 19 at the “Simply Delicious Food Market” in Vernon, British Columbia.</p>
      <h3>Police “confident” they’ll catch perpetrators</h3>

      </p>
      <p>With police reportedly on the scene just 15 minutes after the store’s security systems were triggered, the two men escaped in time and remain at large — yet an interview with the store owner indicated that a fair amount of evidence had been captured:</p>
      <blockquote>"Our security camera caught at least one of their cars drive away, which was a grey Nissan Sentra. The police were also able to catch their license plate too."</blockquote>
      <p>While the local media report gives little context on the small-town grocery store’s decision to install a Bitcoin ATM — Vernon has a population of just over <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=POPC&amp;Code1=0983&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=59&amp;SearchText=Vernon&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=0983&amp;TABID=1&amp;type=0">40,000</a> — the shaken owner said he now plans to remove the machine. </p>
      <p>The adverse impact of the small-time heist is all the more ironic given the thieves’ own hamfisted success, with local reporters revealing that: </p>
      <blockquote>“The thieves made off with $4,000, but left $50,000 still in the machine in a canister they didn’t check.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide at all-time-high</h3>
      <p>In fall 2018, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/innovation-behind-bars-the-arrest-of-indias-first-bitcoin-atm-operators">reported</a> on the Indian authorities’ controversial arrest of the developers of the country’s first Bitcoin ATM. </p>
      <p>The story carried particular symbolic clout in light of the two suspects being the co-founders of the country’s first cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/unocoin">Unocoin</a>, celebrated by the local industry as being among India’s brightest tech pioneers. </p>
      <p>The arrests were vehemently opposed amid a fog of regulatory uncertainty and the case’s intersection with the government’s evolving stance toward the sector at the time.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the number of Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-atms-worldwide-hit-new-milestone-surpassing-6-000">reached a new milestone</a>, surpassing 6,000. </p>
      <p>In a development apparently not directly triggered by the news directly, the United States <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/irs">Internal Revenue Service</a> has this week revealed it is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-vs-bitcoin-atms-industry-says-there-is-already-enough-regulation">looking into</a> potential tax issues caused by cryptocurrency ATMs and kiosks.</p>
