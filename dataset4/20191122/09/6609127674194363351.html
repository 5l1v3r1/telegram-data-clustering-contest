        <b>A CREATIVE mum-of-one has revealed how she completely transformed her kitchen without help for only £60.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hannah Williams, 25, from Essex, decided to bite the bullet and decorate her kitchen after being fed up of looking at her dull, brown cupboard doors.</p>

      <p>Hannah, a junior project manager, said: "My partner Jordan, 28, and I moved into our flat in February 2018 and from day one I really wanted to redecorate the kitchen.</p>
      <p>"I kept nagging Jordan about it but he kept pushing it back so, when he was away in Ireland one weekend, I decided to just do it myself as I was tired of it look so dull.</p>
      <p>"I'd seen articles online about people doing up their kitchens on a budget, so thought I'd give it a go.</p>
      <p>"I did the majority of it by myself over the May bank holiday weekend - my dad helped a little bit here and there too."</p>

      <h3>BREAKDOWN OF WHAT HANNAH SPENT</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>B&amp;Q - GoodHome multi surface paint for cupboard doors, £20</li>
        <li>Amazon - Door handles, £11.20</li>
        <li>Vinyl Warehouse - Worktop vinyl, £17.95</li>
        <li>Wilko's - Whispering sage wall paint 2.5L, £12</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Total £61.15</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hannah, who was pregnant at the time, made the kitchen look completely different in just four days and kept the renovation cheap by getting items from places like Amazon, B&amp;Q, and Wilko's.</p>
      <p>The now mum of one added: "I didn't realise you could just paint over the cupboard doors, I thought you had to get new ones completely.</p>
      <p>"Once I realised, I went to B&amp;Q and bought some of their GoodHome multi surface paint for cupboard doors for just £20 - a hell of a lot cheaper than getting them refitted!"</p>
