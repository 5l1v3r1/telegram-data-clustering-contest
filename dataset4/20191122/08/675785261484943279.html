      <h1>Dejan Lovren explains how "unbelievable" Joe Gomez reacted to Raheem Sterling incident</h1>
      <h2>The Croatian defender praised the way his teammate handled the training ground incident which led to Sterling being left out of England's game against Montenegro</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:58:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Dejan Lovren has praised his "unbelievable" Liverpool teammate Joe Gomez for the way he reacted to an incident with Raheem Sterling on England duty.</p>
      <p>Sterling was dropped by England boss Gareth Southgate after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/joe-gomez-scratch-caused-raheem-20870789">he left Gomez with a scratch around his eye</a> in a seemingly unprovoked altercation just a day after the pair had gone head-to-head in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Gomez and Sterling clashed in the closing stages of Liverpool's 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield before the international break, and Sterling seemingly still had that on his mind when he saw Gomez at St. George's Park a day later.</p>
      <p>Southgate dropped him from England's clash with Montenegro, with a smattering of England fans then booing Gomez when he came on as a substitute in the same game.</p>

      <p>Sterling immediately took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-raheem-sterling-hits-out-20884701">to criticise that reaction</a> , and Lovren - who played with Sterling for one season at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> - says that his fellow defender has now put it all behind him.</p>
      <p>"I think he reacted well, to be honest," the Croatian told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11866725/dejan-lovren-i-had-to-start-from-zero-again-at-liverpool">Sky Sports</a> .</p>
      <p>"I've been speaking with him two or three days ago and asked about it and he was OK, positive and this is what is important for the club and his team-mates.</p>

      <p>"We are behind him and that's what he needs at the moment."</p>
      <p>Lovren added that Gomez didn't deserve the reaction he received from some England fans.</p>
      <p>"He's an unbelievable man and player but it's aggravated everything about that and he didn't deserve it," he added.</p>

      <p>"You're playing for the national team and he's there, giving his best so I don't think he deserved the boos."</p>
      <p>Lovren and Liverpool go to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday looking to maintain or improve their eight point lead at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
