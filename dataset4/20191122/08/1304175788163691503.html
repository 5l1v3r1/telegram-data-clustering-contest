      <h4>Among the Top 25 Markets, Anaheim/Santa Ana, California, registered the largest jump in RevPAR (+6.1% to US$138.20).<br/> </h4>
      <p>HENDERSONVILLE, TENNESSEE — The U.S. hotel industry reported negative results in the three key performance metrics during October 2019, according to data from STR. </p>
      <p><b>In a year-over-year comparison with October 2018, the industry posted the following</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Occupancy: -0.8% to 69.3%</li>
        <li>Average daily rate (ADR): -0.5% to US$133.34</li>
        <li>Revenue per available room (RevPAR): -1.2% to US$92.35</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“<i>The industry had not reported consecutive months of RevPAR decreases since December 2009 and January 2010</i>,” said <b>Carter Wilson</b>, STR’s senior VP of consulting and analytics. “<i>We considered the three previous sub-0.5% monthly declines in this record-setting expansion cycle as blips. With October’s RevPAR decrease of 1.2%, there’s more evidence for a pronounced slowdown on the horizon. As noted in our revised forecast, we’re projecting RevPAR increases below 1% for 2019 and 2020. The industry has not been below 2.9% growth for a year since the recession." </i></p>
      <p>“<i>With October specifically, group occupancy was down 8.6%. That’s in large part because of the Jewish holiday calendar shift from September in 2018. With slower demand growth and the industry’s first supply increase of at least 2.1% since April 2010, there was obvious pressure on occupancy levels and already fragile pricing confidence</i>.”</p>
      <p>Among the Top 25 Markets, Anaheim/Santa Ana, California, registered the largest jump in RevPAR (+6.1% to US$138.20).</p>
      <p>Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia, posted the largest lift in ADR (+5.5% to US$184.27), which resulted in the second-largest increase in RevPAR (+5.2% to US$142.95). </p>
      <p>Houston, Texas, experienced the highest rise in occupancy (+5.3% to 68.0%). </p>
      <p>Boston, Massachusetts, saw the steepest decline in RevPAR (-11.8% to US$191.12), mostly because of the largest drop in occupancy (-7.1% to 83.1%).   </p>
      <p>New Orleans, Louisiana, reported the steepest decrease in ADR (-5.7% to US$161.23) and the only other double-digit decline in RevPAR (-10.4% to US$118.65). </p>
      <p>Overall, the Top 25 Markets (RevPAR: -2.4%) in aggregate have underperformed all other markets (RevPAR: -0.4%) in 12 of the past 13 months. </p>
