        <i>This carefully told morality story about life in the shadow of gang violence in south-east London is a strong debut for Andrew Onwubolu, AKA Rapman</i>
      </p>
      <p>YouTube hasn’t been the best breeding ground for cinematic talent, as 2010’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/16/fred-the-movie-film-review">Fred: The Movie</a>, which grew out of a hit on the video-sharing platform, will attest. This much-hyped inner-city drama – the debut of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/08/rapman-the-london-film-maker-who-gatecrashed-hollywood-in-style">Rapman, AKA Andrew Onwubolu</a>, whose web series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/18/move-over-bodyguard-shiros-story-youtube-crime-drama-joivan-wade-percelle-ascott-rapman">Shiro’s Story</a>, reached 10m hits – is an assured and capably performed morality play.</p>
      <p>Tackling a vicious outbreak of gang violence on the border separating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/peckham">Peckham</a> and Lewisham in London, Onwubolu ports across many of the elements that made his online endeavours such a success – chiefly a sure feel for the south-east London streets and his own rapped on-camera narration.</p>
      <p>This last element is where Blue Story is most innovative, elevating a stock melodrama – centred on childhood pals Tim and Marco (Stephen Odubola and Micheal Ward), set in fatal conflict by their older brothers’ affiliations – into exhilaratingly musical territory. (Turn the dial, and we’re not too far from Greek tragedy, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/01/romeo-juliet-baz-lurhmann-leonardo-dicaprio-claire-danes-20th-anniversary">Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet</a>.) The device is at least as dynamic as the scuffling, which erupts out of nothingy Tuesday afternoons, or indeed Onwubolu’s sometimes lurching narrative. A “three years later” card placed at the halfway mark allows for closer scrutiny of the consequences of street violence, whereupon Odubola – pick of the film’s promising new faces – reinvents likable Tim as a brooding avenger.</p>
      <p>If there’s a limitation, it may be in a modesty of means and spirit you might not expect from a film-maker newly signed to Jay-Z’s Roc Nation label – it’s a headscrambler to see a Paramount Pictures production with scenes that take place outside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/08/greggs-is-on-a-vegan-roll-baker-thriving-social-media">a Greggs</a>.</p>
      <p>But this is true to the way Onwubolu avoids the usual flash and posturing in favour of a careful, rooted storytelling, finding subtly different perspectives on gang life, and offering his characters as many ways out as there are ways in.</p>
      <p>• Blue Story opens in UK cinemas on 22 November.</p>
