      <p>The laptops are equipped with Dolby Atmos sound system and a new Sound Radar feature, it's said to increase the atmospheric gaming experience which is nice. The keyboard layout delivers a 100% anti-ghosting with less than 1ms response time and also, the Legion Coldfront is pre-installed inside to keep the laptops cool down. </p>
      <p>The Legion Y740 and Y540 have multiple ports connectivity for the gamers as well, which includes a HDMI 2.0 port which allows you to set your gaming station up to three monitors for maximum viewing pleasure.

      <p>Next, the<b> ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2</b> is for the workaholics.<b> </b>It's lightweight, compact, and carries powerful tech specs such as the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics, 9th Generation Intel Core processors, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM (2x DIMMs), and up to 2 SSDs (2x M.2 2280 PCIe TLC and SATA) for 4TB max.

      <p>If you thought supporting up to three monitors was impressive, this one can support up to four of them as well as having a 4K OLED touchscreen on the laptop's screen panel. On top of that, Lenovo also mentioned that there's a new Glance technology which you can use your eyes to move the cursor and move windows like a wizard. That's pretty convenient if you plan to have multiple monitors around you. </p>
