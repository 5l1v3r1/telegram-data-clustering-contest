      <h1>Vehicles spinning out on Malahat this morning due to icy conditions</h1>

      <p>Vehicles have been spinning out on the Malahat portion of the Trans-Canada Highway due to icy conditions this morning.</p>
      <p>Shawnigan Lake RCMP said they have received several calls this morning about “black ice” and officers are on the highway now trying to slow down traffic and checking for winter tires.</p>
      <p>George Gidson of Malahat Gas, at 231 Trans-Canada Hwy., said vehicles have been spinning out on a particularly bad corner.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had four cars in a row here wipe out, spin around, and be able to keep going,” said Gidson.</p>
      <p>In another incident two cars collided but were able to get to the side of the road and drive away, Gidson said.</p>
      <p>The province’s highway crews have been contacted and residents are waiting for them to come and salt the roads, he said. “We’re waiting for highways to show up and spray it or something,” he said.</p>
      <p>Environment Canada shows the Malahat hit a low of 2.3 Degrees C last night.</p>
      <p>The province requires motorists on the Malahat and other major highways at high elevations in B.C. to have winter tires — with a snowflake symbol for mountain and snow use or an M+S symbol for mud and snow. All tires must be in good condition with good treads. Large heavy trucks must carry chains.</p>
