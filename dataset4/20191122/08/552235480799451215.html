      <h1>From Celtic's Tannadice rage to importing foreign refs - the internal politics that led to infamous strike</h1>
      <h2>Charlie Richmond was one of 31 officials to withdraw their labour nine years ago this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:06:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:06</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Nine years ago this weekend Scottish football was plunged into chaos when referees voted to strike for the first time in the history of our game.</p>
      <p>After a perceived increase in unacceptable comments towards officials, questioning their integrity and a feeling SFA chiefs weren’t doing enough to back their employees, officials took the decision to withdraw their labour for a weekend.</p>
      <p>It was unprecedented, saw foreign refs flown in to take charge of games and came a month after what became known as ‘Dougie-gate’.</p>
      <p>Ex-Grade One ref McDonald was found to have lied to his supervisor and Celtic boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> over his decision to reverse a penalty given to the Hoops in a game at Tannadice.</p>
      <p>Having claimed he consulted with his assistant Steven Craven over the decision, it later <br/>transpired he made the call before consulting his linesman.</p>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-football-association">SFA</a> warning was issued to McDonald but less than a month later the decision was taken and backed by the majority of Scotland’s referees to withdraw labour for a weekend.</p>
      <p>Charlie Richmond was one of the group of whistlers that went on strike.</p>
      <p>But the former Grade One official admits, nine years on, that he always had reservations over the course of action.</p>
      <p>Richmond missed the meeting where the vote was taken for family reasons.</p>
      <p>But he reckons the strike has had little or no impact in the long run – with comments towards officials from the sidelines and in the media no better now than they were back in 2010.</p>
      <p>He said: “Nine years later have the referees benefited from it?</p>
      <p>“Probably not because there are still managers talking about standards of refereeing.</p>
      <p>“Back then they were talking about integrity but we have had instances in the last few months and years where other refs have been called out in incidents that have bordered on integrity and personal things.</p>

      <p>“John Beaton springs to mind. At the time was that any worse or better than when Dougie McDonald decided on a proposal for a withdrawal of services?”</p>
      <p>Recalling the mood at the time Richmond, who retired in 2012, told <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>: “It was all to do with one referee and certain comments at a certain game, he was circling the wagons to try and get people to side with him.</p>
      <p>“But I would say there was nothing over and above what was probably normal comments.</p>
      <p>“Was he right to go down the avenues he did rather than other means?</p>
      <p>“I think the other younger inexperienced guys had maybe been toed along a wee bit reluctantly rather than sitting down and asking what is the whole concept and how do we all feel.”</p>
      <p>The SFA were forced into a mad scramble across Europe to round up as many foreign refs as possible to fulfil fixtures.</p>

      <p>In total 11 games were to go ahead with a further nine postponed due to insufficient numbers of officials.</p>
      <p>But the strike lost its impact when the weather decided to get involved too and a whiteout saw a further seven games called off for snow and frozen pitches.</p>
      <p>Officials from Malta, Israel, Luxembourg and Portugal were brought in.</p>
      <p>But the appointments were thrown into further confusion when the Portuguese contingent returned home immediately after arriving at Glasgow Airport.</p>
      <p>They claimed they had been sold the idea under false pretences and were under the impression they were heading to Scotland as part of an exchange programme, claims denied by the SFA chiefs.</p>
      <p>It was a mess with only matches between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and Inverness, Hamilton and St Mirren, Hibernian and St Johnstone and Kilmarnock and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> going ahead.</p>
      <p>Asked if the strike had the desired effect, Richmond said: “In hindsight probably not.</p>
      <p>“A lot of games were lost to the weather rather than to the fact that there were no referees available.</p>

      <p>“A few games went ahead with the same ref doing a game on the Saturday and then the Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Was it beneficial to hammer home the message at the time? Probably not.</p>
      <p>“It would have been different if it had been March or April time when you are not losing as many games to the weather.</p>
      <p>“Across the board we had said if we got one game postponed then it would be an impact, so then I suppose you could say it had some effect.</p>
      <p>“Certainly the statement aspect had the desired affect of ‘Oh my God the refs are going to withdraw their services’.”</p>
      <p>Richmond says little has changed in terms of communication between club officials and refs.</p>
      <p>He reckons the best thing for all parties would be for referees to come out and explain decisions after games.</p>
      <p>He added: “You need to understand the role of a referee and what he is there to do and the role of a manager and what he is there to do.</p>
      <p>“What we need to see is a bit more in the wider education of things. It might be down to coming out and explaining why we gave decisions and the laws of the game.</p>
      <p>“Some refs would welcome it and some wouldn’t but in my opinion that’s the road we need to go down.”</p>
