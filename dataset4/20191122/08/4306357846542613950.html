      <h3>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has reassured Jose Mourinho that the club can fund a move for Gareth Bale if the new Spurs manager wants to sign the Real Madrid star, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p>Website <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501288-exclusive-jose-mourinho-offered-gareth-bale-deal-as-daniel-levy-backs-new-tottenham-boss">90min</a> is reporting that Levy has provided his new manager with assurances that Spurs have the resources to pursue a swoop for Bale if Mourinho wants the Wales international.</p>
      <p>The same article states that the new Tottenham manager is an admirer of Bale despite missing out on the chance to work with the Welsh winger at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Bale is looking to get more regular playing time ahead of next summer’s Euro 2020 after falling out of favour under Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p><i>90min</i> go on to suggest that Spurs are more likely to sign Bale on a loan deal, with the Wales star’s wages providing a potential stumbling block to any deal.</p>
      <p>Bale scored 55 times in 203 games in all competitions during his previous stint at Tottenham before Real Madrid signed the attacker in a £85.7m deal in 2013.</p>
      <p>Spurs are in 14th position in the Premier League table and 11 points behind fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s predecessor Mauricio Pochettino led Tottenham to their first-ever Champions League final last term.</p>
