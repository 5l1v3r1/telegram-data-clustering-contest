      <p>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) on Thursday announced the upcoming listing of Bakkt’s cash-settled Bitcoin futures contracts on ICE Futures Singapore.</p>

      <p>Commenting on the development, Lucas Schmeddes, president and COO of ICE Futures and Clear Singapore, said: “Our new cash-settled futures contract will offer investors in Asia and around the world a convenient, capital-efficient way to gain or hedge exposure in bitcoin markets.”</p>
      <p>The cash-settled contracts will be settled against data from the physically delivered Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures contract.</p>
      <p>“Building off the success of our deliverable futures contract, the cash-settled futures will leverage ICE’s regulated, globally-accessible market to offer a safe, secure and compliant environment for the trading of bitcoin,” Schmeddes added.</p>
      <p>The contracts will be listed on the platform on December 9.</p>
      <h3>The rising market of crypto derivatives</h3>
      <p>The ICE subsidiary launched its much anticipated physically-settled Bitcoin futures in September after getting a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the United States.</p>
