      <p>LONDON, Nov 22 — Most euro zone government bond yields were little changed today as markets awaited the release of key business activity data, as well as a speech from new European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.</p>
      <p>After a relatively lacklustre week in regional debt markets, driven by headlines related to US-China trade relations, focus returned to the euro zone economy.</p>
      <p>IHS Markit’s final Purchasing Managers’ Index for major euro zone economies is due for release from 0815 GMT. The data is a well-regarded gauge of economic health with investors looking for any signs that a downturn in sentiment is bottoming out.</p>
      <p>“The PMIs are likely the most important data points of the week, and consensus is leaning towards a continued bottoming-out of sentiment within the euro zone,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note.</p>
      <p>“In spite of this, the market would probably be more reactive to a disappointing reading, which would suggest the worse is yet to come.”</p>
      <p>ECB chief Lagarde is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech in Frankfurt during the morning session and will be watched closely ahead of Lagarde’s first ECB meeting next month.</p>
      <p>Analysts said Lagarde was likely to strike a compromising tone, with the aim to re-unite a governing council deeply divided by September’s decision to re-start controversial asset purchases.</p>
      <p>In early trade, most 10-year bond yields in so-called “core” markets such as Germany, France and the Netherlands were little changed on the day.</p>
      <p>Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield was flat on the day at -0.32 per cent, off near three-week lows hit earlier in the week. It was also little changed on the week.</p>
      <p>Italy’s 10-year bond yield was 3 bps higher on the day at 1.32 per cent, but set to end the week a touch lower after four straight weeks of rises. — Reuters</p>
