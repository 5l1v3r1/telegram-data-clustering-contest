      <p>Anu Malik, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, met the creators of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sony/">Sony</a> TV’s show Indian Idol 11 and told them about <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/anu-malik-steps-down-as-judge-of-indian-idol-11-6130623/">his decision of leaving his position of judge on the show.</a> A source shared with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>, “After numerous social media outbursts and negative trends, Anu Malik decided to step out of the show. He also shared how he is mentally disturbed at the moment. Anu recently met the makers and shared his decision with them, and they agreed to him quitting his post as a judge. The channel is now on the lookout for a replacement.”</p>
      <p>In an interview with Hindustan Times on Friday, the music composer clarified, “I have not quit the show. I have taken a three-week break. I want to clear my name and return to the show. If someone is saying things about me again and again on social media, it gets to you. I wrote an Insta post explaining that I am in a dark space. This Twitter campaign has been going on since a while and I was tired of these false, malicious accusations on social media. The best thing is once you clear your name and go back to business, it is good for everyone.”</p>
      <p>Sona Mohapatra also spoke to IANS regarding Anu Malik’s exit from Indian Idol. “I was fighting for fairness and justice. Now, after hearing this news, I think it is a victory for everybody – not just me but also for all other women who were badly treated by him. It is a symbolic victory. Our fight is not over yet, it’s just a start. We are not going to sit here and let people to take us for granted,” the singer said.</p>
      <p>She added, “Sony TV took a long time to do this but I am happy that he has finally stepped down from the show. It’s a battle of the whole country. There are so many people who did not want to see this person (Anu Malik) flaunting himself on national television because it gives a lot of wrong messages to predators that they can also get away with such a thing.”</p>
      <p>Sona Mohapatra was the first celebrity to accuse Anu Malik of sexual misconduct in 2018. Later, Neha Bhasin and Shweta Pandit joined her and came out against the music composer.</p>
