      <p>VANCOUVER — The Vancouver Police Department has confirmed that an investigation is underway into allegations against three officers who worked in the same special unit as disgraced detective Jim Fisher.</p>
      <p>“As part of a thorough investigation conducted by the VPD into the actions of Jim Fisher, concerns about the conduct of three members from the counter-exploitation unit related specifically to the Fisher investigation were referred to an independent agency for investigation,” said an email from the police department on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The department did not say what independent agency is investigating the matter or detail the allegations involving the unidentified officers in the unit, which investigates prostitution and criminal exploitation cases.</p>
      <p>The officers have apparently been under investigation since 2017. This became public only during a case-management conference Wednesday in the B.C. Court of Appeal, where a lawyer for a pimp who was convicted following an investigation by the unit raised the issue.</p>
      <p>Marilyn Sandford, who is handling the appeal of Tamim Albashir, told Justice David Frankel that the investigation of the three officers apparently relates to corruption-related offences.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, B.C. Solicitor-General Mike Farnworth said he was aware of the investigation into the three, calling it a “serious” matter.</p>
      <p>Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, chairman of the Vancouver Police Board, said he could not discuss the matter in detail and declined to identify the agency investigating the officers.</p>
      <p>During Wednesday’s court appearance, Sandford told Frankel that a total of four — Fisher and the three unidentified officers from of the nine-member sex-crimes unit — have been either convicted or remain under investigation.</p>
      <p>She said that she and the lawyer for Albashir’s co-accused, Kasra Mohsenipour, were frustrated by delays in getting information related to the Fisher file.</p>
      <p>“Years have gone by. Our trial occurred in 2017 and now here we are in 2019,” Sandford said.</p>
      <p>The defence lawyer said things would have been easier had she been able to get access to disclosure material through the lawyer who represented her client at trial, but added that legal undertakings have stymied those efforts.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for the Crown told the court that attempts are being made to ensure proper disclosure is made.</p>
      <p>The matter ties into the appeal of Reza Moazami, a convicted pimp who was also investigated by Fisher and who is seeking disclosure related to fresh allegations of misconduct on the part of Fisher.</p>
      <p>Moazami was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted of more than two dozen counts of pimping and sexual interference involving victims ranging in age from 14 to 19.</p>
      <p>Postmedia and the CBC have applied to see documents filed in support of the new Fisher allegations and are going to court on a constitutional question arising from what they allege is the court’s restrictive access policy.</p>
      <p>Fisher, 60, a much-decorated detective, lost his appeal this year of a 20-month jail term for committing sex-related offences against two vulnerable crime victims.</p>
      <p>The trial of Albashir and Mohsenipour heard that the two conspired to establish a pimping enterprise, recruiting one girl who was 15 at the time and two other young women to work as prostitutes, exercising control and direction over them, and exploiting them.</p>
      <p>Albashir got 10 years in prison while Mohsenipour received nine years.</p>
