      <p>The Eastern Cape Provincial Government has spent in excess of R91m on accident-damaged state-owned vehicles over the past three years.</p>
      <p>That is according to a written reply from the MEC for Transport Weziwe Tikana, to questions posed in the Legislature by the Democratic Alliance.</p>
      <p>DA MPL, Marshall von Buchenroder said that Tikana’s response had revealed that over the past three financial years, the province had written off vehicles collectively valued at over R28.622 million.</p>
      <p>“The province had also spent an additional R63.150 million on repairing accident damaged vehicles over the same time period,” he said.</p>
      <p>Von Buchenroder said that according to Tikana the Province had only claimed back R3.801 million from officials who had been found to be negligent, or who had not been authorised to make use of the state-owned vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>
