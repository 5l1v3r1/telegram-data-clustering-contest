      <p>Cape Town - She’s been praised for the drastic transformations she undergoes for movie roles – but not everyone has been chuffed with Charlize Theron’s work.</p>
      <p>During a Producer Roundtable discussion with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/charlize-theron-peter-chernin-producer-roundtable-1256085"><b>The Hollywood Reporter</b></a><b>,</b> the 44-year-old actress opened up about how her weight gain deterred people from investing in the 2003 movie Monster.</p>
      <p>"As soon as I started gaining weight, I had one of the financiers call me up," Charlize revealed.  </p>
      <p>"Actually, his wife saw me, and she was like, 'Did you see Charlize? Have you seen what she looks like?' And I got that call, like, 'What's going on with that?'</p>
      <p>"He was like, 'What are you doing? You never smiled. You look so angry, you look horrible,'" she continued.</p>
      <p>Although her portrayal of prostitute Aileen Wuornos won her an Oscar, Charlize adds that at first she was fearful she might have gone too far.</p>
      <p>"So you panic a little bit because you are putting yourself out there, and you are taking a risk, and when you do that, you are not a hundred percent sure.</p>
      <p>"You are taking a chance. So there is a part of you that second-guesses, right? And you are like, 'Shit, well, maybe I did go too far with this.' Then you realize you have to stand that ground."</p>
      <p>Charlize also revealed that financiers thought they were going to get a very different movie, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7712199/Charlize-Theron-claims-Monster-financiers-thought-getting-hot-lesbian-movie.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"I think the financiers actually thought they were basically paying for a hot lesbian movie with me and Christina Ricci," Charlize said.</p>
