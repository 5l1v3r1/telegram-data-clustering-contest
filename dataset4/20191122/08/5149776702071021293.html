      <h1>Company boss said he knew nothing about millions of smuggled cigarettes inside hollowed-out washing machines</h1>
      <h2>The trial continues</h2>

      <p>A company boss told a court that he had no idea that 2.6 million smuggled cigarettes were inside washing machines delivered to Nottingham.</p>
      <p>"I know nothing of that," said Rafal Szczepanik of Leeway Road, Southwell as he gave evidence at his trial.</p>
      <p>Nottingham Crown Court has been told that the cigarettes were of two brands which should never be sold in the UK. The haul evaded tax amounting to Â£756,422 and was found inside hollowed-out washing machines.</p>
      <p>Szczepanik, 42, described how he was arrested when he arrived at a storage unit he had leased on Trent South Industrial Park near Little Tennis Street on June 28.</p>
      <p>Investigators were waiting and he told a jury: "I was approached by a woman who started shouting 'sir, sir.' She started calling her colleague.</p>
      <p>"I was standing next to her and he shouted 'you are arrested.'"</p>
      <p>Questioned by Mark Cotter QC, defending, he said that he owns a bonded warehouse near his Polish home, which is six miles from the Ukrainian border.</p>
      <p>His customers include people from Russia and the Ukraine. He said: "They buy goods around the whole of Europe and the world. They send them to us in containers and lorries."</p>
      <p>He said that he leased storage space in London but this was not a success because of a family illness.</p>
      <p>A stepdaughter runs a cafe in Nottingham and so he decided to find one in the city.</p>
      <p>Four men have admitted being concerned in the fraudulent evasion of excise duty.</p>
      <p>Szczepanik denies the charge.</p>
      <p>The court has been told that the case was investigated by HM Revenue and Customs officers. They used a ram to get into the unit.</p>
      <p>Gareth Weetman, prosecuting, said: "They found a total of 46 dummy washing machines and 18 of them were still secured on pallets."</p>
      <p>The cigarettes were two brands which are illegal in the UK, 2,662,240 Minsk cigarettes and 8,460 carrying the Pect name.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
