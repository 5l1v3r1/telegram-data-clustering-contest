      <p>Supply of coal by state-owned CIL to the power sector registered a decline of 8.5 per cent to 253 million tonnes in the April-October period of this fiscal.</p>
      <p>Fuel supply by Coal India in the year-ago period was 276.8 million tonnes (MT), according to official data.</p>
      <p>The supply of coal to power sector by CIL in October dropped by 19.3 per cent to 33.8 MT, over 41.9 MT in October last fiscal.</p>
      <p>With torrential rains hitting coal production, Coal India had said that it was keeping a close watch on the current situation to ensure smooth supplies to power plants.</p>
      <p>CIL saw its output decline by 6 per cent to 241 MT in April-September on account of monsoon.</p>
      <p>“CIL is gearing up to regain its production tempo and keep coal supplies to power sector going after the torrential rainfall across its subsidiaries dealt a crippling blow to the company’s coal production and offtake,” the company had said in a statement.</p>
      <p>CIL had said that a team of officials is closely monitoring coal supplies to power plants and is working on plans to divert coal to fuel-starved plants.</p>
      <p>The state-owned firm had earlier said that it will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year.</p>
      <p>The PSU will further produce 1 billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi had said.<br/>The PSU is currently given the target of producing 660 million tonnes of coal amounting to 82 per cent of the country’s coal output.</p>
      <p>Joshi had said that with the demand for power rising steeply, there is enough opportunity for both government and private sectors to produce coal without adversely impacting each other.</p>
