      <p>CHICAGO (AP) — Even without Nikita Kucherov and Steven Stamkos, Tampa Bay had enough.</p>
      <p>Anthony Cirelli and Brayden Point scored 2:39 apart midway through the third period, and the Lightning beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-2 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“You can’t replace those guys,” Point said. “They’re world-class players. We were short guys, but we had guys step up, guys creating energy for us.”</p>
      <p>Kucherov, the reigning NHL MVP after he led the league with 128 points last season, is day to day after suffering an upper-body injury in the second period of Tuesday’s 3-1 loss at St. Louis.</p>
      <p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Stamkos, who leads the Lightning with seven goals and 20 points, was held out of the second and third periods with a lower-body injury, but he stayed on the bench. He played 5:17 over nine shifts in the first.</p>
      <p>“He hung in there,” coach Jon Cooper said. “He felt he was going to be OK, and sat on the bench too long in the second.</p>
      <p>“He wanted to be on the bench with his teammates and cheer them on. I thought that was a big move for him and us.”</p>
      <p>Cooper didn’t know how long Stamkos will be sidelined.</p>
      <p>Mikhail Sergachev scored a power-play goal in the first period, and Cedric Paquette added an empty-netter. Backup Curtis McElhinney made 32 saves for Tampa Bay, which had dropped two in a row.</p>
      <p>Brent Seabrook and Dylan Strome scored for Chicago, and Corey Crawford made 31 stops. But the Blackhawks dropped their second straight since a four-game win streak.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay earned its eighth consecutive victory against Chicago. The Blackhawks haven’t defeated the Lightning since a 1-0 overtime win on Oct. 24, 2015, four months after Chicago beat Tampa Bay to win the Stanley Cup.</p>
      <p>Blackhawks star Patrick Kane extended his point streak to 11 games with his 600th career assist. He logged a game-high 27:52 of ice time.</p>
      <p>Coach Jeremy Colliton used 11 forwards and leaned heavily on his dynamic winger after his team fell behind.</p>
      <p>“Kaner is playing well and it was an opportunity to use him a bit more,” Colliton said. “It seemed like our best opportunity to get back in the game.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, we didn’t have enough guys going up front.”</p>
      <p>Kane didn’t mind the extra work.</p>
      <p>“I feel like the more you play, the more you get into the game,” Kane said. “There were some chances I probably could have capitalized on.”</p>
      <p>For most of the game, the Lightning checked closely and kept the Blackhawks on the perimeter.</p>
      <p>“We played a responsible game,” Sergachev said. “We didn’t turn the puck over much, didn’t give them much inside in our zone. We were down a couple guys, but we played desperate.”</p>
      <p>Sergachev scored his first goal this season with 3:50 left in the first period. He fired through a screen from the top of the slot and beat Crawford low on the glove side on a power play.</p>
      <p>Crawford made a left pad save on Cirelli’s one-timer with 5:37 left in the second to keep Chicago within a goal.</p>
      <p>Seabrook tied it 8:27 into the third. He skated down the boards from the right point to the goal line and then lifted a shot from a sharp angle that glanced off the back of McElhinney’s left shoulder and into the net.</p>
      <p>Cirelli got the lead back for Tampa Bay on a deflection of Victor Hedman’s shot from between the circles. Point made it 3-1 with 7:37 left in the third, tapping in Ondrej Palat’s feed from across the slot.</p>
      <p>Strome converted a rebound of Kane’s shot to cut it to 3-2, but Paquette sealed it with 59.2 seconds left.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Kucherov is second on the Lightning with 18 points (six goals, 12 assists). "Thought he'd be better when he got to the rink today, but he wasn't," Cooper said. ... F Cory Conacher took Kucherov’s spot in the lineup. … Blackhawks F Drake Caggiula missed his fifth game under the concussion protocol. ... Chicago F Andrew Shaw was in the lineup after missing Wednesday’s practice with a hip issue. ... D Luke Schenn was a healthy scratch for the Lightning and F Dominik Kubalik was scratched for the Blackhawks, who dressed seven defensemen.</p>
