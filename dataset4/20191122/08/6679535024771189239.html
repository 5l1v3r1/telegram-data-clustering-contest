      <p>Actor Eddie Redmayne says he would love to see beloved <i>Harry Potter</i> character Hagrid to appear in the third chapter of franchise’s spin-off films, <i>Fantastic Beasts.</i></p>
      <p>Redmayne, who plays Newt Scamander in the new series, made the revelation in a Reddit AMA.</p>
      <p>When asked which character he would like to see feature in <i>Fantastic Beasts 3</i>, the Oscar winner replied, “Hagrid Hagrid... always Hagrid“.</p>
      <p>Veteran actor Robbie Coltrane played Hagrid, the half-giant and a dear friend to the troublesome trio —Harry, Hermione and Ron —in the <i>Harry Potter</i> films.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Warner Bros confirmed that production on the new film is set to begin next March 2020, to be released in 2021.</p>
      <p>After New York and Paris, where the earlier two <i>Fantastic Beasts </i>movies were based, Brazilian city Rio De Janeiro will serve as the backdrop of the new film.</p>
      <p>Besides Redmayne, the film’s returning cast members include Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler and Katherine Waterston.</p>
