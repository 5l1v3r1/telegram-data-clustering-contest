      <h1>Government push for more refugees in regional Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:30:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Gredley</a></address>
      <p>HALF the refugees accepted into Australia will live in regional areas by 2022, the federal government hopes.</p>
      <p>Immigration Minister David Coleman has outlined the new goal on Friday, coupled with a range of measures to steer refugees outside of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</p>
      <p>A government report into refugee resettlement shows the number of people on humanitarian visas moving to regional Australia has increased each year.</p>
      <p>More than 40 per cent of refugees are expected to move into the regions this year.</p>
      <p>The government will support refugees to become financially independent, learn English and to feel at home.</p>
      <p>“We want to ensure all refugees and humanitarian entrants have the best possible opportunity to settle into Australian life, gain employment and contribute to their new communities,” Mr Coleman said.</p>
      <p>The federal government has also recently increased its regional migration program intake from 23,000 to 25,000.</p>
      <p>Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says regional abattoirs and industry rely on migrant workers.</p>
      <p>“You talk to the local farmers – they can’t get their beef processed or their lamb processed without that local workforce of migrant workers,” he told reporters in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Mr Dutton said West Australian Premier Mark McGowan had contacted the Morrison government outlining the state’s desire for more migrant workers.</p>
      <p>As of last week, Perth and the Gold Coast are no longer classified as major cities so they can be a regional destination for both migrants and refugees.</p>
      <p>While the Refugee Council of Australia says it’s pleased the government undertook the review which will have positive outcomes, it believes the regional settlement target is only a slight increase.</p>
      <p>“The government’s current goal is to resettle 40 per cent of refugees in regional areas. Increasing this to 50 per cent would involve a relatively modest number of people in areas which together cover most of the country,” council chief executive Paul Power said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The new measures include:</b>
      </p>
      <p>* A Commonwealth coordinator-general for migrant services in the Department of Home Affairs.</p>
      <p>* Trial of a skilled refugees visa program.</p>
      <p>* New employment strategies.</p>
      <p>* Helping connect refugees with community groups.</p>
      <p>* Trialling an English language learning program – with classes outside of regular institutions – from next July.</p>
