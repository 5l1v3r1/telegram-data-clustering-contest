      <h1>Robert Pires's advice to under pressure Unai Emery amid Arsenal slump</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners legend is still close to the club and believes Emery can still turn their dreadful recent form around despite speculation his time is running out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:48:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal winger Robert Pires believes manager Unai Emery must work together with his players to find a solution to their recent dreadful form.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have won just one match in their last six in all competitions and find themselves eight points off the top four, with some fans calling for Emery to be sacked.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest criticisms levelled at Emery has been that he has been unable to get his point across to his squad, with some claiming his lack of English has been a problem.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1395282/2019/11/22/pires-is-helping-injured-arsenal-players-recover-i-can-feel-how-they-are-doing-when-they-are-alone-on-the-field/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> , Pires said he believes the Gunners still have the ability to make a success of their season.</p>

      <p>"This team has such quality," he said. "The squad can improve this situation. The most important thing now is that Unai Emery needs to talk to the group to try to find a solution together. I hope they can, for the players, for the club, for the manager."</p>
      <p>He also suggested Emery may be struggling with the intensity of the Premier League, having come from a background of managing in Spain, Russia and France.</p>
      <p>Pires added: "I know he is having trouble. Unai is a good guy. He is a nice person. He is a good manager. He is under pressure unfortunately.</p>

      <p>"Fans can’t always appreciate the details of the situation but to be a manager is very difficult, especially when you work in the Premier League. You can be a manager in Spain, France or Italy but when you come to England the intensity is totally different. It is about the fight, the spirit. The intensity is extremely difficult.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> have a big chance to get back to winning ways when they host struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday before games against Norwich, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in the Premier League.</p>
