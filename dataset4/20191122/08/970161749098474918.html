      <h1>Couple sell everything they own and risk bankruptcy to live on an old school bus</h1>

      <p>Tawny MacVay, 34, and her husband Michael, 31, had a family gym business, a three-storey house, and a nice car. But they weren’t happy.</p>
      <p>They decided to make a change, selling everything they owned so they could buy a bus and travel the world.</p>
      <p>But overhauling your life isn’t so simple.</p>
      <p>While the couple found buyers for their home and business, both fell through after they had bought their bus, meaning they were near bankruptcy and had to live with family for six month.</p>
      <p>They didn’t let that roadblock stop them from pursuing their dreams of a new lifestyle. In December 2018 they managed to sort out their finances and get to work on turning an old school bus into a home.</p>
      <p>The bus, which Tawny and Michael call Oliver, was originally a 2004 school bus they bought for $5,000 (£3,900). Renovations – including creating a kitchen and adding a cosy bed, set them back $15,000 (£11,700).</p>

      <p>In May 2018, they moved aboard full-time. They haven’t looked back since.</p>

      <p>‘We owned a business, a three-storey home and all the usual means of measuring success,’ said Tawny. ‘We were classed as successful and should have been wildly happy, but we weren’t.</p>
      <p>‘In early spring of 2018 we saw a documentary about a couple who converted a school bus into a tiny home. We did some research and put our house on the market a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>‘Within two months, we had sold most of our belongings, and had the house and our business under contract. We searched and searched for the perfect bus, finally found it, and with everything tied up, we bought the bus and jumped in.’</p>

      <p>The couple’s bus now has a living area with a Murphy bed, a full kitchen with jobs and a fridge, a bathroom with a composting toilet, a shower, a washer/dryer, and a bedroom.</p>
      <p>It’s powered not just by petrol but with solar panels stuck on top.</p>
      <p>So far Tawny, Michael, and Oliver, have journeyed more than 5,000 miles, travelling through the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, and plan to head south to avoid the cold through winter.</p>
      <p>The pair sleep and relax on the bus, jumping off to take their Great Dane, Apollo, for walks and stopping in cities to fill up on water. They now both work as writers, too.</p>
      <p>As we said, it’s not an easy ride, but the couple are so glad they packed up things and joined the bus life.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve been very fortunate to not have too many problems while on the road,’ says Tawny.</p>

      <p>‘When we told our family and friends what we were going to do they laughed. Mike and I are pretty impulsive people and also don’t stay inside the societal norm box. They nodded and went along with it I suppose they are used to our ‘oddball’ choices.</p>
      <p>‘We have two kids who also travel with us part-time when they’re not with their biological dad. We like that we can teach them to follow their dreams even if they aren’t ‘normal’.</p>

      <p>‘Every lifestyle comes with pros and cons. Having a home on wheels isn’t always an easy choice, it takes determination as you have breakdowns and travel issues to deal with.</p>
      <p>‘To be honest, as the saying goes, we would rather die on an adventure like this than live standing still. If you understand that, if you feel something when we say that, bus life could be for you.</p>
      <p>‘People who say ‘I wish I could do that’ guess what? You can! We don’t have special skills, we had no experience before we got started, we learnt as we went on and with help from others with experience.</p>

      <p>‘All it takes is the determination and the desire to push through no matter what.’</p>
