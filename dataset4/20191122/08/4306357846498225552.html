      <h3>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is determined to sign Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7707531/Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer-determined-sign-75m-rated-Erling-Braut-Haaland-summer.html">The Daily Mail</a> is reporting that Solskjaer is focused on signing the Norwegian teenager after the Manchester United boss gave Haaland his debut at Molde two years ago.</p>
      <p>The same article states that the Red Devils have retained an interest since before Solskjaer took over the reins of the 20-time English champions back in December.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Manchester United are ready to make an offer for the Norway international despite Salzburg’s lavish £75m price tag for the striker.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> report goes on to add that Manchester United can expect to face competition from Premier League rivals Arsenal, Real Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The article continues that Manchester United are still considering a move to sign Haaland despite his father Alfe Inge Haaland indicating that the Premier League isn’t their preferred destination.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has scored 15 goals in 12 games in the Austrian top flight this season, while Haaland has found the net seven times in four games in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are short on forward options after they sold Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan as well as loaning out Alexis Sanchez to the San Siro giants in the summer transfer window.</p>
