      <h1>Hundreds of new jobs announced at Derby's Bombardier</h1>
      <h2>There are roles for applicants of all ages and experience</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:53:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Derby's Bombardier has announced 400 <a href="https://www.fish4.co.uk/jobs/derby/">new job vacancies</a> as it ramps up production on a number of big contracts.</p>
      <p>The train-maker is looking for hundreds of extra employees to boost its workforce at the Litchurch Lane factory to help it deliver hundreds of carriages for three key customers - Greater Anglia, South Western Railway and West Midlands Trains.</p>
      <p>The firm has now launched a push to fill the positions at the Derby site through recruitment firm Shorterm Group.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/bombardier">Bombardier said</a> it was welcoming applications from people of all backgrounds, in terms of age, level of experience and gender.</p>
      <p>It said that bespoke training would be provided to people with a basic mechanical knowledge and experience of using hand tools who want to gain entry into the industry.</p>
      <p>The firm also said it was looking for experienced workers with knowledge of the rolling stock sector, including welders, electrical testers and vehicle builders.</p>
      <p>Start dates for the new staff would be from between now and March next year.</p>
      <p>Bombardier spokesman Will Tanner said: “As we ramp up production on a number of new train building projects at Derby, we want to recruit 400 extra front-line staff.</p>
      <p>“We want applicants from all backgrounds, age and levels of experience, including those who haven’t thought about the rail industry before.”</p>
      <p>In recent years, Bombardier has landed a number of major contracts for its Aventra train - designed, developed and now built in Derby.</p>
      <p>They include orders from Greater Anglia, South Western Railway and West Midlands. Now, many of these contracts are starting to come on-stream - and Bombardier now needs extra workers to build them.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the company lifted the lid on the new train it is supplying to South Western Railway - the Class 701 Aventra.</p>
      <p>The Litchurch Lane site is building a total of 750 carriages, which make up 90 trains, in a deal worth almost £900 million. The first trains are due to enter service by the middle of next year.</p>
      <p>To apply for the jobs at Bombardier e-mail an up-to-date CV to <a href="mailto:jobs@shortermgroup.com">jobs@shortermgroup.com</a> or call 01332 224540.</p>
