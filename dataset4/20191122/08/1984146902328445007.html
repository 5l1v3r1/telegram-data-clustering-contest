      <h1>Newcastle and Durham university staff confirm eight-day strike as talks on pay and pensions fail</h1>
      <h2>Members of the University and College Union will walk out from November 25 and not return to work until December 4</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>North East academics will walk out of their lecture halls next week, after talks with university representatives failed.</p>
      <p>Members of the University and College Union at both <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/durham-university">Durham</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-university">Newcastle</a> universities are among the staff at 60 institutions who will join in an eight-day strike over pay, pensions and conditions.</p>
      <p>The two-part dispute covers one argument over "pay inequality", with the University and Colleges Employers' Association, the lead body for university pay. Academics say staff who are female and/or from ethnic minorities receive disproportionately lower pay, and that university staff are facing increasing workloads and more 'casualisation' of employment.</p>
      <p>The union has also accused Universities UK, which represents employers on pensions, of "failing to make a serious offer" over the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a pension scheme for lecturers which has proved controversial.</p>
      <p>Striking staff will be on picket lines at the entrances to their universities from 8am, outside the King's Gate entrance in Newcastle and near the Palatine Centre in Durham. Picketers will then make their way to Old Eldon Square, in Newcastle, for a rally at 1pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>UCU North East regional official Iain Owens said: "Strike action is a last resort, but universities’ refusal to deal with these key issues have left us with no alternative. It is staggering and insulting that universities have not done more to work with us to try and find a way to resolve these disputes.</p>
      <p>"We hope students will continue to put pressure on university vice-chancellors to get their representatives back round the negotiating table for serious talks with the union."</p>

      <p>In September, the national union of students said its members stood "shoulder to shoulder" with their teachers.</p>
      <p>But the national negotiating bodies say the pension and pay issues should be treated separately, and called on members to avoid strike action. On Thursday, Universities UK outlined a commitment to working with the union to reform the USS scheme.</p>
      <p>Professor Mark E Smith, chairman of UCEA, said: "The universities represented in both these sets of negotiations have shown that they place a high value on their employees and have increased their investment in both pay and pensions to continue to offer fair pay and excellent pensions benefits as part of a national, sector-wide framework.</p>
      <p>"We continue to talk to the union in the hope of finding a way of averting industrial action. We respectfully ask UCU, and its members, to reconsider whether the proposed action is the best approach to expressing and addressing their concerns."</p>
      <p>Professor Julia Buckingham, President of Universities UK, added: "In recent months, employers have taken significant steps to protect the value of both pensions and pay because we care about our dedicated and talented staff.</p>
      <p>"Universities will do all they can to minimise the impact of any strike action on students, their other staff and the wider community and they know that their colleagues contemplating strike action will want this too.  We sincerely hope UCU will see the merit in working with employers on joint and fair solutions."</p>
