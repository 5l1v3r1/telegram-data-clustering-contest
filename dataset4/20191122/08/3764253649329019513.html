        <b>- Former governor of Niger state, Babangida Aliyu, has called for the cancellation of Kogi and Bayelsa elections</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- Aliyu said the cancellation became important for the growth of democracy in Nigeria</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The former PDP governor said the outcome of the elections did not reflect the people's choices</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barely one week after the conduct of Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections held on Saturday, November 16, a former governor of Niger state, Babangida Aliyu, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel the polls.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/vanguard.html">Vanguard</a> reports that Aliyu, who was a PDP governor, made the call in a press statement issued by his media officer, Bala Bitrus, on Thursday, November 21, in Minna.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng </b>reports that he urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government and the INEC to annul the elections in the interest of peace, the growth of democracy and fairness.</p>
      <p>He said:<i> “We hereby ask INEC and the government in <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a> to annul the elections in the interest of peace, the growth of democracy and fairness. This is for the soul of Salomi Acheju Abuh and of all those who were slain in Kogi and Bayelsa states in the course of last Saturday’s elections by the agents of the states.</i></p>

        <i>“We ask the federal government to not only condemn the wanton killings and destruction of properties but to empanelled well-balanced committees to probe the dastardly acts and speedily bring those behind the arsons and fish out their sponsors for proper justice.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He condemned the killing of the PDP’s women leader of Wada Aro campaign council in Kogi state, Salome Abuh, who was burnt to death in her house by allegedly sponsored armed political thugs.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“As civilized citizens, we note with serious concern that the general conducts of the governorship elections in the two states, where innocent citizens were subjected to crude, brutal and naked use of force have rubbished the essence of the elections. Therefore we reject the outcomes of the two elections in their entirety.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The conducts and outcomes of the elections in the two states are therefore not the reflections of free choice by the electorate in the two states nor are they in tandem with democratic traditions hence we reject the results posted by INEC in all their ramifications," </i>he said.</p>

      <p>The former governor said that it was time for the country to begin to take a critical look at the electoral system and ensure that the right things are done toward safeguarding democracy and its true culture in all elections.</p>
      <p>Responding, Alhaji Mohammed Imam, the chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Niger, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that Aliyu was merely seeking for relevance.</p>
      <p><i>“He is actually canvassing for such, knowing fully well that INEC cannot annul election after it had declared it,”</i> he said.</p>
