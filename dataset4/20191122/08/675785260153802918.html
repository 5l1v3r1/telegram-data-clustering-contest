      <p>Panic erupted on a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737 during a terrifying crash landing in strong winds in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The aircraft’s front landing gear was 'torn off' as the plane skidded off the runway in Odessa.</p>
      <p>A total of 134 people evacuated mainly from emergency chutes at the rear of the 737-800.</p>
      <p>The plane came within a few feet of the ground on an aborted first landing attempt but went around again, say reports.</p>
      <p>A passenger told Strana Ukraine: “We started descending and the moment the plane touched the ground we felt a strong smell of smoke.</p>

      <p>“Panic erupted.</p>
      <p>"Everyone panicked, even the crew.</p>
      <p>“The plane skidded off the runway and stopped in a field.”</p>
      <p>Footage appeared to show that the aircraft came to rest on a taxiway.</p>
      <p>“There was deathly silence inside the plane when the braking started.</p>

      <p>“Then the chutes were lowered quick and people were evacuated.”</p>
      <p>The front wheel of the plane broke and the nose was resting on the ground.</p>
      <p>Pictures show the Boeing with its nose down and tail up.</p>
      <p>Some reports said the crew were not able to use the forward chutes and most passengers exited from the rear.</p>

      <p>There were “no injuries” in the evacuation.</p>
      <p>Turkish Airlines said all 134 passengers and crew were healthy and had safely evacuated.</p>
      <p>The airport was closed for several hours after the emergency on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The incident involved flight TK467 from Istanbul to the Black Sea port city of Odessa which usually takes 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>Winds were reported as up to 24 metres a second with stormy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> leading to raging seas and trees torn down.</p>
      <p>It was the second accident on the same day at Odessa International Airport.</p>
      <p>Earlier the airport had been closed for two hours after a business jet suffered a problem during an aborted takeoff.</p>
      <p>Turkish Airlines has been approached for comment.</p>
