      <p>An American teenager from Naperville, Illinois, has been charged with two counts of felony hate crime and one count of misdemeanour disorderly conduct after listing a black student as a "slave for sale" on Craigslist and adding a racial slur to the appalling post, WGN9 reported on Thursday.</p>

      <p>According to the broadcaster, who spoke with the mother of the victim, the two teens used to get along pretty well, but their friendship ended last October.</p>
      <blockquote>"They used to be friends, they are not anymore. The moment he started teasing my son, calling him dumb, making fun of his skin colour, saying 'shut up slave' last October", she said.</blockquote>
      <p>Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall has called the post "despicable and extremely offensive”, stating it does not reflect the local community.</p>
