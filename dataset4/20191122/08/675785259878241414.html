      <h1>Ed Woodward's message to Jose Mourinho after ex-Man Utd boss lands Tottenham job</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho was sacked by Ed Woodward and co at Man Utd last December but has found his way to Tottenham after they sacked Mauricio Pochettino this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:18:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has revealed that Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was one of the first people to contact him after he was handed the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> job.</p>
      <p>Portuguese Mourinho signed a four year contract with Spurs on Wednesday following Mauricio Pochettino's departure from north London.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of management since he was sacked as United boss 11 months ago but it turns out his former employees have been quick to forgive and forget.</p>
      <p>Woodward and managing director Richard Arnold were among the first of 700 phone calls sent to the ex-Chelsea chief, with their messages "respectful", "empathetic" and had "feeling".</p>

      <p>"Maybe I get the opportunity to apologise for not answering 500 (phone calls) of them that I couldn't answer," Mourinho told Sky Sports. "I have 700 but only had time to answer 200.</p>
      <p>"But it was curious to see, from my last club, so many people showing me that respect, empathy and feeling. It was nice.</p>
      <p>"All of them were special. The first one was from Richard Arnold. The third, fourth or fifth was Ed Woodward. And they were my bosses."</p>
      <p>Mourinho has swapped Woodward and Arnold for the notoriously tricky Daniel Levy at Spurs.</p>

      <p>But the three-time Premier League winner reckons that he and Levy will be like peas in a pods after a successful first first meeting.</p>
      <p>"I think we will get on well," he said. "He explained to me the vision for the club and I embraced that. It was one of the most important reasons I accepted. So when I did that, it's a very good start."</p>
      <p>Mourinho begins his reign against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I had a feeling I was going to get a club mid-season," he said.</p>
      <p>"I knew I would be in a situation where I would get only one or two days before my first game. I cannot come here and think it is about myself. It is about the players and going from a base of stability.</p>
      <p>“These last 11 months (of being out of management) have been used to think and to prepare.</p>
      <p>"You never lose your DNA. You are what you are - for the good things and the bad things. I know in my career that I’ve made mistakes.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to make the same mistakes. I’m going to make new mistakes. I’m not going to say I’m more fit. I was always fit.”</p>
