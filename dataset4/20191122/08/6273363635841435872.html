      <h1>Tesla unveils electric pickup truck with angular design and armored glass</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:47:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(<i>Reuters</i>) — Tesla on Thursday unveiled its first pickup truck, delivering <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/27/elon-musk-teases-timeline-for-tesla-pickup-truck-with-tweet/">on a promise</a> by CEO Elon Musk to build an electric version of America’s favorite vehicle and one that threatens the heart of Detroit automakers’ profits.</p>
      <p>At a launch event in Los Angeles, Musk said the truck, which looked like a futuristic armored vehicle, will have a starting price of $39,900 and a maximum range of 500 plus miles.</p>
      <p>“We need sustainable energy now. If we don’t have a pickup truck we can’t solve it. The top 3 selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks. To solve sustainable energy, we have to have a pickup truck,” he said.</p>
      <p>Production is expected to begin in late 2021.</p>

      <p>Musk earlier tweeted the design was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s 007 film <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>.</p>
      <p>The truck marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan is the world’s top-selling battery electric car, into pickup trucks, a market dominated by Ford, along with models by General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.</p>
      <p>The pickup shifts Tesla more toward trucks and SUVs. The automaker has so far sold mostly Model S and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/03/inside-teslas-model-3-production-sprint/">Model 3 sedans</a> but also offers the Model X SUV and, starting next year, the Model Y compact SUV.</p>
      <p>A focus on the high-performance end of the market is only natural, given the success of Ford’s 450-horsepower F-150 Raptor truck, which launched in 2009 and whose sales have since risen annually, according to Ford spokesperson Mike Levine.</p>
      <p>While Ford does not disclose Raptor sales, Levine said annual demand is well above 19,000 vehicles, and the No. 2 U.S. automaker has never had to offer incentives on the model, which is priced in the high $60,000 range. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup.</p>
      <p>Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings, like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV, as well as electric pickups.</p>
      <p>Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.</p>
      <p>Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.</p>
      <p>Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment — both full- and mid-sized models — will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate.</p>
