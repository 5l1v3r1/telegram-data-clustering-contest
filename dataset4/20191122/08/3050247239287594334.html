      <h1>Coinbase Custody Extends Crypto Staking to Global Investors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:50:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The institutional asset custody arm of United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase has <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseCustody/status/1197572816276611078?s=20">announced</a> it is transitioning to an internationally-based staking service as of Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>In rolling out its staking services to a global investor base, Coinbase Custody appears to be leveraging its brand recognition to promote staking as a key emergent investment strategy for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. </p>
      <p>The announcement states the custodian intends to offer all of its global clients “appropriate access to crypto first features like staking.”</p>
      <p>Coinbase Custody has been <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-custody-begins-staking-services-with-tezos-maker-to-follow">offering</a> an institution-grade staking service for Tezos (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xtz-price-index">XTZ</a>) as of March 2019 — subject to jurisdictional eligibility requirements — with the company’s flagship exchange rolling out <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-cryptocurrency-exchange-opens-tezos-staking-to-all-us-customers">support</a> for XTZ staking to U.S. clients earlier this month. </p>
      <h3>How staking works</h3>
      <p>Staking is specific to Proof-of-Stake (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/pos">PoS</a>) blockchains and essentially allows network participants to passively earn a form of “interest” by depositing their tokens to both maintain the network and potentially earn rewards.</p>
      <p>As opposed to Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, nodes in a PoS network are engaged in validating blocks rather than mining them. A deterministic algorithm selects block validators based on the number of tokens a given node has staked in their wallet — i.e. deposited as collateral in order to complete the addition of the next block to the chain.</p>
      <p>During the protracted crypto winter of 2018, staking was pitched as an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bloomberg-proof-of-stake-token-investors-could-use-staking-for-gains-during-bear-market">investment “survival” strategy</a> by crypto fund managers and analysts, with many emphasizing that HODLers going long may as well stake to reap the “interest.” </p>
      <p>Dissenting voices — among them Bloomberg’s Aaron Brown — have argued against the strategy’s long-term viability on the basis of the fundamental merits of PoW over PoS currencies when it comes to trust and security. </p>
      <h3>Ethereum’s transition to PoS and the wider industry</h3>
      <p>The narrative that staking is set to have a major impact on the industry has recently been aired by top crypto exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/binance">Binance’s</a> research arm, whose <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-research-ethereums-switch-to-staking-will-transform-industry">report</a> has looked at the impact of token lock-ups on liquidity and compared the potential risk-return profile of staking as a passive investment strategy vs. active trading. Binance has itself <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-binance-launches-dedicated-staking-platform">rolled out</a> staking services this fall.</p>
      <p>As the Ethereum network gears up for its eventual transition to PoS-based Ethereum 2.0., a senior ConsenSys executive has recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-20-validators-to-earn-up-to-10-annually-for-staking-report">revealed</a> that Ethereum 2.0 validators can expect to earn from 4.6% to 10.3% as rewards for staking on an annual basis.</p>
