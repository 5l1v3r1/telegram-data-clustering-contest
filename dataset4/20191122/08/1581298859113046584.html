      <p>On the four-year anniversary of the devastating Esperance region bushfires, local firefighters battled another blaze in Cascade.</p>
      <p>The fire on November 17, 2019, tore through more than 750 hectares.</p>
      <p>Through a coordinated local response, it was contained and alert was downgraded by nightfall.</p>
      <p>Department of Fire and Emergency Services Great Southern superintendent Wayne Green thanked firefighters and the Shire of Esperance.</p>
      <p>"Being that it's the anniversary, our thoughts are still with the families involved, the Curnow, Butcher, Sushchova-Winther and Kohrs-Lichte families," he said.</p>
      <p>"Also the response crews out there, it's been playing in their minds that this is two years in a row that they have had fires on, or very close to that anniversary date.</p>
      <p>"I pass on gratitude and my thanks to everyone who was involved in that fire over the weekend."</p>
      <p>Mr Green said the blaze was caused by an accidental header fire, which quickly spread through dry Unallocated Crown Land.</p>
      <p>"The fire did take a good run through some pasture, it started on private property and the winds fanned it along," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Green said more than 20 vehicles responded and extra resources were sent to the scene before it escalated.</p>
      <p>"We had our DFES officers embedded into the local government incident in support very early, rather than waiting for a request for assistance," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was just a fantastic team effort to be able to get on top of these fire so quickly, but also to prepare for the unknown.</p>
      <p>"Rather than waiting for it to get bad then ramping up our response, we are sending the response early."</p>
      <p>Mr Green said with dry conditions and record breaking temperatures across the state, residents should prepare for the season ahead.</p>
      <p>"We need people to be familiar with the Emergency WA website and finding information about how they can best prepare, not only during an event but right now," he said.</p>
      <p>"People do need to be prepared, especially around their homesteads or around their properties in neighboring bushland.</p>
      <p>"They need to make sure that their gutters are cleaned out, there's no debris and other basic housekeeping around the property."</p>

      <p>The 2015 Esperance bushfires burned for 11 days, destroying hundreds of thousands of hectares and claimed the lives of Kim 'Freddy' Curnow, Thomas Butcher, Anna Sushchova-Winther and Julia Kohrs-Lichte.</p>
      <p>In a touching tribute, sister of Tom Butcher, Jess Greenaway, said she would always hold on to the memory of her 'hero'.</p>
      <p>"November 17, four years on you're still here in my heart and mind bro, still making me laugh because your stories live on," she said.</p>
      <p>"I hold you in a thought and I can feel you. I feel you and this gives me strength and courage.</p>
      <p>"The tears I have cried for you could flood the earth, and I know you have wiped each one away.</p>
      <p>"For you brother, I promise you this, I will go on with my life and make you proud. I will always hold you in my heart.</p>
      <p>"You will forever be in our lives, you will forever be a brother, a son, an uncle, a brother in law and friend.</p>
      <p>"Love you so much bro, miss you so much, always my hero."</p>
