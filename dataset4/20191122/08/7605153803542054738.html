        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 22 – New Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho is convinced he will be able to challenge for the Premier League title next season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs following the Argentinian’s sacking earlier this week and has declared himself happy at being back in management.</p>
      <p>While his immediate concern is arresting a slump that has seen the north London club slip to 14th in the Premier League, his wider brief will be to end the trophy drought which stretches back to 2009.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s previous record of success, with 25 trophies at the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea and Inter Milan, makes him the perfect man for the job and he has targeted a potential fourth Premier League title.</p>
      <p>Back in work after a tough spell at Manchester United ended 11 months ago, the Portuguese tactician is enthusiastic about the group of players he will work with and has backed them to be title contenders next season.</p>
      <p>“We cannot win the Premier League this season,” he said. “We can – I’m not saying we will do – we can win it next season.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has insisted he will not need to make signings in January after revealing he tried to sign some of the Spurs squad in previous roles.</p>
      <p>“I don’t need players. I am so happy with what I have,” he said. “I just need time to understand them better and know everything about them because I always say you only know a player when you work with them. Of course, how many times have I watched these guys, how many times have I played against them?</p>
      <p>“I knew them well but you never know them well enough until you work with them and my gift is this squad because the squad is very, very good. I told them that one of the reasons why I decided to come was them.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s first game at the helm comes on Saturday when Spurs make the trip to the London Stadium to face West Ham.</p>
