      <p>A local court in Telangana has directed the Saidabad police to register a case against All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) floor leader and Chandrayangutta legislator <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/insta/as-akbaruddin-owaisis-health-condition-deteriorates-asaduddin-appeals-to-supporters-to-pray-for-brothers-recovery">Akbaruddin Owaisi </a>for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups in his speech  in Karimnagar in July.</p>
      <p>A city advocate Kashmishetty Karunasagar had approached the court with a complaint against Akbaruddin Owaisi for delivering derogatory remarks during a public meeting in Karimnagar.</p>
      <p>Karunasagar first approached the police station but they refused to file a case. He then filed a complaint before the court. The court directed the Saidabad police to register a case under Section 153,153 A, 153B and 506 of IPC and asked them to submit the report by December 23.</p>
      <p>On July 23 at a public meeting in Karimnagar in Telangana, Owaisi had said the RSS had not yet recovered from the "15-minute blow" he had delivered in his 2012 speech.</p>
      <p>In his incendiary speech he delivered in 2013, the junior Owaisi had said that if police is removed for 15 minutes, “we (Muslims) will finish 100 crore Hindus”.</p>
      <p>In contrast to this elder brother who is perceived as a little guarded, Akbaruddin Owaisi has a history of making incendiary speeches.</p>
      <p>In 2007, he issued death threats against Tasleema Nasreen, pledging that the fatwa against her and Salman Rushdie will be executed.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Owaisi used the derogatory terms Kafirs and Kufrastan to refer to MLAs in Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Assembly.</p>
      <p>In a widely circulated speech in 2012 that sent shockwaves among the members of Hindu community, Owaisi made obscene comments against Hindu god Rama and his mother Kaushalya. Owaisi asked "Where all did Ram's mother go wandering and where did she give birth to him.</p>
