      <p>Ranked as “UK’s Number 1 British African sitcom”, it all began in 2011 as a web series that was self-funded by the show’s creators, Osayemi and Deborah Odutayo.</p>
      <p>Despite their failure to market the content to major traditional broadcasters at their early stage, they decided to put the show online. The decision paid off as the official trailer attracted 10, 000 views on Youtube in its first week and the numbers increased to 1.4 million viewers over several weeks.</p>
      <p>“I pitched to the BBC and they said no, pitched to ITV — NO, Every broadcaster in the UK? NO NO NO. I was at my wit’s end. I was devastated. I had risked all of my investors’ money-making 7 episodes of a TV show and couldn’t find a buyer for it,” Osayemi recounted.</p>

      <p>Nine years later, it has now been picked up by Netflix, a major streaming platform with subscribers in over 190 countries. It became available for streaming on November 4, 2019.</p>
      <p>“Meet the Adebanjos” has won several awards across the globe including Zaffa, NEL, Screen Nation, Bafta and UK Black Comedy Awards.</p>
      <p>It shows the interesting tale of an old fashioned Nigerian father who struggles to instill African values into his reluctant British family.</p>
