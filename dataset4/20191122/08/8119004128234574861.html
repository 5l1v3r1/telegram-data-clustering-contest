      <h1>Asian shares up from three-week lows, but trade uncertainty nags</h1>

        <b>Asian equities rose on Friday, bouncing from a three-week low touched a day earlier, but gains were capped by persistent worries over the status of trade negotiations between China and the United States.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up 0.12%. The index had fallen as much as 1.41% on Thursday, hitting its lowest level since October 30, on concerns that U.S. legislation on Hong Kong threatened to undermine trade talks between the world’s two largest economies.</p>
      <p>Australian shares were up 0.52% and Japan's Nikkei .N225 gained 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Worries that a "phase one" trade deal between the United States and China might not occur until next year weighed on investor sentiment on Wall Street overnight, pulling the S&amp;P 500 .SPX down 0.16% to 3,103.54, the Dow Jones down 0.2% to 27,766.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC 0.24% lower to 8,506.21.</p>
      <p>Those losses were tempered by China saying it was willing to work with the United States to resolve core trade concerns, and a report in the Wall Street Journal that China has invited top US trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing.</p>
      <p>“I was ready to give up on a trade deal yesterday. But it seems the Chinese haven’t so I, we, mustn’t,” said Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro.</p>
      <p>But analysts at ANZ said in a morning note that whipsawing hopes over a deal were starting to wear on investors in the 16th month of the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>“It’s fair to say that some signs of trade-headline fatigue are emerging in markets,” analysts at ANZ said in a note.</p>
      <p>While Asian stocks ticked higher, US Treasury yields were broadly unchanged after snapping three sessions of declines on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was at 1.7723%, just a hair higher than its US close of 1.772% on Thursday. The policy-sensitive two-year yield US2YT=RR, was at 1.6046% compared with a US close of 1.605%.</p>
      <p>In currency markets, the safe-haven yen was a touch stronger, with the dollar dropping 0.05% to 108.58 JPY=. The euro was up 0.05% at $1.1063.</p>
      <p>The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was unchanged at 97.993.</p>
      <p>Oil prices retreated after hitting two-month highs on a Reuters report that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are likely to extend existing output cuts until mid-2020.</p>
      <p>US crude CLc1 dipped 0.41% to $58.34 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Spot gold XAU= edged up 0.04% to fetch $1,464.70 per ounce.</p>
