      <h1>IN FULL: Alex Salmond denies rape, two indecent assaults and 11 sexual assaults</h1>
      <h2>Former SNP leader and first minister of Scotland Alex Salmond appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday accused of a string of sex offences, including attempted rape.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:49:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/paulmalik/" target="_blank">Paul Malik</a></address>
      <p>Salmond, of Strichen, Aberdeenshire, appeared for a preliminary hearing before Lady Dorrian, where he faced 14 charges alleged to have taken place over a six-year period.</p>
      <p>One offence is said to have happened at the Scottish Parliament and another at Stirling Castle.</p>
      <p>According to the attempted rape charge, Salmond blocked his alleged victim’s path, pinned her against a wall, pushed her on to a bed and lay naked on her at Bute House in Edinburgh in June 2014.</p>
      <p>In addition, Salmond is also accused of assaulting a woman with the intent to rape her in the luxury taxpayer-funded Charlotte Square residence in December 2013.</p>
      <p>Shortly before 10am yesterday, the country’s press squeezed into courtroom number three, before Salmond – clad in a charcoal suit, blue shirt and saltire-patterned tie – walked to the dock from the public benches.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old sat flanked by two security guards, who he greeted with a hello and a smile, before presiding judge Lady Dorrian entered.</p>
      <p>Discussions between the bench and Lady Dorrian proceeded, during which Gordon Jackson QC, representing Salmond, said his client denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>In total, 10 women have alleged offences against the veteran independence campaigner.</p>
      <p>They cannot be named because complainers in cases involving allegations of sexual offences have the right to lifelong anonymity under Scots Law.</p>
      <p>The indictment faced by Salmond includes a charge of attempted rape, 11 allegations of sexual assault – including one with intent to rape – and two of indecent assault.</p>
      <p>The charges span a period between June 2008 and November 2014.</p>
      <p>One of the instances of sexual assault is said to have taken place in September 2014, the month of the Scottish independence referendum.</p>
      <p>Other charges involve alleged incidents in which Salmond is said to have indecently assaulted a woman by kissing her mouth and groping her on various occasions around Glasgow between June and July 2008.</p>
      <p>It is also alleged he sexually assaulted a woman on various occasions between May 2011 and June 2013 at the Scottish Parliament, Bute House and elsewhere by touching her bottom and stroking other parts of her body.</p>
      <p>Salmond – who was Scotland’s first minister from 2007 to 2014 – is further accused of taking off a woman’s shoe and trying to kiss her foot during a car journey in Edinburgh on a date in October 2013.</p>
      <p>The indictment states that in September 2014, Salmond grabbed a woman by her shoulders at Bute House, repeatedly kissed her face, tried to kiss her lips and touched her leg and face.</p>
      <p>Several charges involve allegations the accused groped women, including one instance at a restaurant in Glasgow in March 2012.</p>
      <p>The court hearing, which lasted around 15 minutes, heard from Mr Jackson and the advocate depute.</p>
      <p>They agreed to a further preliminary trial date, which will take place on January 22.</p>
      <p>A trial date has been fixed for March 9 2020 at the High Court in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The defence advised Lady Dorrian the trial is expected to take four weeks to complete.</p>
