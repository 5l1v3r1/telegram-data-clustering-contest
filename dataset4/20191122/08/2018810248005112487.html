      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, you might be dismayed to learn, is definitely not <i>Half-Life 3</i>. But it is a new “full-length” <i>Half-Life</i> game, Valve said today, and it’ll be out in March.</p>
      <p>In a press release, Valve said the game—<a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/valve-announces-new-half-life-game">first announced earlier this week</a> to surprise, confusion, and memes <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/the-internet-reacts-to-the-announcement-of-a-new-half-life-game">from fans</a>—has been “designed from the ground up for virtual reality,” but is still very much a<i> Half-Life</i> game in that it features “world exploration, puzzle solving, visceral combat, and an intricately woven story that connects it all with the characters iconic to the <i>Half-Life</i> universe.”</p>

      <p>It’s set between the events of <i>Half-Life 1</i> and <i>2</i> and stars Alyx, as the title suggests.</p>
      <p>“Alyx Vance and her father Eli secretly mount the resistance to the brutal occupation of Earth by a mysterious alien race known as The Combine,” reads the game’s description. “As Alyx, players take the fight to the Combine to save the future of humanity.”</p>

      <p>Despite ostensibly being a killer app for Valve’s own VR headset, <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/valve-index-is-luxurious-but-a-hassle">the Valve Index</a>, <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be compatible with “all PC-based VR headsets” when it releases in March 2020. Screenshots thus far depict Alyx having hands, which is something that was technically already canon, but now her hands are your hands, and you get to use items like the enticingly named “gravity gloves.” If they are not somehow involved in a game of fetch with Dog, I’ll eat a Vortigaunt.</p>
      <p><b>Update, 1:15 PM ET:</b> In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/21/half-life-alyx-is-about-the-same-length-as-half-life-2">an interview with <i>IGN</i></a>, Valve designer and programmer Robin Walker said that some former members of <i>Firewatch</i> studio Campo Santo—<a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/04/sources-valve-buys-firewatchdeveloper-campo-santo">hired by Valve last year</a> ostensibly to continue working on their next game, <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/12/firewatch-developers-are-making-a-game-about-exploring-egypt"><i>In The Valley of Gods</i></a>—are working on <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>.</p>
      <p>“Some members of the former Campo Santo studio are on the team, and they’ve brought the storytelling skill they honed in <i>Firewatch</i> to bear on <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>,” said Walker. “But in that regard, they’re like the rest of us at Valve—people who played <i>Half-Life 1 &amp; 2</i>, took parts of it into their own games, honed those parts into something even better, and are now bringing that knowledge back to what inspired them in the first place.”</p>
      <p>The current status of<i> In The Valley of Gods</i> is unclear.</p>
      <p>Walker also said that <i>Alyx</i> is roughly the same length as <i>Half-Life 2</i>, which puts it at around 13-15 hours long.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, The Game Awards host and <i>Death Stranding</i> main character Geoff Keighley released a video interview with members of the <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> team in which they discuss the game’s origins as an exploration of VR mechanics (rather than setting out to create a new <i>Half-Life</i>, specifically) and why it’s not<i> Half-Life 3</i>.</p>
      <p>“Back in 2016 when we started this, <i>Half-Life</i> was just terrifying. So <i>Half-Life 3</i> was a terrifying, daunting prospect,” said Walker. “And I think, to some extent, VR was a way we could fool ourselves into believing we had a way to do this... The way the gravity gun helped us in<i> Half-Life 2</i>, it became the tentpole you could wrap so much around. So VR became this thing we could wrap everything around. Whereas<i> Half-Life 3</i>, if it’s like ‘Tomorrow you’re working on <i>Half-Life</i> <i>3</i>,’ [then] it’s like ‘Oh god.’”</p>
      <p>During the interview, Valve also confirmed that Valve veterans like <i>Portal 2</i> writers Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton—both of whom departed Valve back in 2017—have been working on <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, as well.</p>
      <p>“It was really easy to recruit for this project, surprisingly enough,” said Valve level designer Dario Casali with a chuckle.</p>
