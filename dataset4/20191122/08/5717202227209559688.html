      <h1>Jamie O’Hara claims Brendan Rodgers will manage Manchester City, and player will follow him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:20:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/topic/sports-breakfast/">Jamie O’Hara has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT</a> (Friday, 7.25am) that he reckons Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers could end up replacing Pep Guardiola at Manchester City – and a Foxes player could follow him.</p>
      <p>Guardiola joined Manchester City in the summer of 2016 and has since won two Premier League titles with the Citizens. But it remains to be seen how long he will remain at The Etihad, and has a contract at the club until the summer of 2021.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager looks unlikely to leave City any time soon – but another failure in the Champions League and Liverpool winning the Premier League title could see Guardiola decide that his time is up.</p>
      <p>Former Tottenham and Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder O’Hara reckons ex-Liverpool and Celtic manager Rodgers could be Guardiola’s replacement as shines as Leicester boss – and £80million-rated (<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10049430/manchester-unite-dtransfer-news-james-maddison-leicester/">Sun</a>) ace James Maddison could follow Rodgers.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a sneaky suspicion that Brendan Rodgers will join Manchester City when Guardiola leaves. I think James Maddison will follow him,” <a href="https://talksport.com/topic/sports-breakfast/">O’Hara said.</a></p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Should Rodgers and Maddison be Man City’s new vision?</h3>
      <p>There are few managers that could replace a boss like Guardiola and remain just as successful. Even the likes of Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and the elder top-class managers of the game may see their best times in management in the past.<br/>Up-and-coming managers are the way forward. Bayern tired their luck with Niko Kovac, Julian Nagelsmann is on fire as Leipzig manager, Zinedine Zidane is hot and cold at Real and Mauricio Pochettino was an enormous success at Spurs.<br/>City may find they have to go for a relatively new manager, and Rodgers fits the bill. Other than his time at Celtic, he has little experience with the big clubs and winning trophies. But he is arguably the most in-form manager in the Premier League.</p>
