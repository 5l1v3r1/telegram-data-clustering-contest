      <h2>Saddlers' academy prospect Callum Cockerill-Mollett is realising his dream of getting a run of games for Walsall after a handful of impressive performances.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:18:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The 20-year-old signed his first professional contract with the club in August 2016, making his senior debut in a 5-2 Checkatrade victory over Grimsby in the same month.</p>
      <p>Injuries meant he was restricted to one senior appearance in the 2017/18 season before he was sent on loan to Telford and Chasetown last season.</p>
      <p>This campaign, the Leicester-born defender has been in and out of the starting XI, but injuries to left-back Cameron Pring has meant Cockerill-Mollett has been handed his chance.</p>
      <p>Praise has been thrown at the youngster from fans and manager Darrell Clarke after impressive displays in Walsall's last three matches.</p>
      <p>And Cockerill-Mollett says a run of games is all he wanted as he bids to prove himself to those at the club.</p>
      <p>“All I want to do is play games for this club," he said.</p>
      <p>“The more games I get, the more chance I have of progressing and getting another contract to carry on.</p>
      <p>“All I have to do is keep working hard, keep playing well and keep my place in the team.</p>
      <p>“All I’ve ever wanted is a run of games and I’m starting to get that now.</p>
      <p>“I feel like every game I’m progressing and playing better.</p>
      <p>“And I get more confident - personally it’s good.</p>
      <p>“The team is doing well too which is a bonus."</p>
      <p>In the league win over Cambridge on Saturday, Walsall fielded Cockerill-Mollett alongside three other academy products, Liam Kinsella, Liam Roberts and Alfie Bates.</p>
      <p>And Cockerill-Mollett says that the historic set-up of the club, giving youngsters a chance, is coming good.</p>
      <p>“That’s the philosophy of the club, it always has been since I’ve been here," he added.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been here for five years now.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been youngsters getting chances.</p>
      <p>“Then moving them on after that, but I want to do well for this club and progress myself.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully get us to the top of the table."</p>
