      <h2>Stafford Rangers boss Alex Meechan says the return of injured players will be like having new signings.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:55:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rosie-swarbrick/" target="_blank">Rosie Swarbrick</a></address>
      <p>Rangers’ slide to the bottom of the Northern Premier Division has coincided with a mass of injuries. But Meechan hopes to see Jake Charles and Sam Cookson return for Saturday’s crunch home clash with 10th-placed Hyde United.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think one or two injury returns would be like new signings for us. </p>
      <p>“Jake Charles and Sam Cookson look like they will hopefully be in the reckoning for Saturday which are two major boosts.</p>
      <p>“Robbie Thompson-Brown is slowly getting to full fitness. We still have a decision to make on Luke Jones. He has gone to see a consultant, we are waiting on that news.</p>
      <p>“Tom Thorley and Theo Bailey-Jones are complicated ones and are going to be longer than what we thought.”</p>
      <p>Meechan and joint Boro boss Andy Fearn face another blow as Danny Burns is suspended for Saturday’s clash. And after three straight defeats, Meechan is keen to taste that winning feeling again.</p>
      <p>He said: “Everyone will be talking about this game. It is imperative that we win.</p>
      <p>“The league table does not lie. After 15 games, we are down there. We just need to dig deep, keep the lads buoyant, make sure they believe in what we are doing – which they do. And we believe in them.</p>
      <p>“We need to get a few more back in form and back on the grass. I don’t question anything else other than getting that elusive win. If we can get that win and try to get some momentum, you will see that wins can take a bit of the pressure off.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing in this league – everyone can beat each other.”</p>
