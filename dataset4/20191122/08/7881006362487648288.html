      <p><b>Washington</b>: The United States on Thursday warned Pakistan that it faced long-term economic damage with little return if China keeps pursuing its giant infrastructure push.</p>
      <p>The top US diplomat for South Asia said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor -- heralded as a game-changer by both Asian countries -- would profit only Beijing and said that the United States offered a better model.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It’s clear, or it needs to be clear, that CPEC is not about aid,” said Alice Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia.</p>
      <p>She noted that the multibillion-dollar initiative was driven by non-concessionary loans, with Chinese companies sending their own labour and material.</p>
      <p>“CPEC relies primarily on Chinese workers and supplies, even amid rising unemployment in Pakistan,” Wells said at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</p>
      <p>The corridor “is going to take a growing toll on the Pakistan economy, especially when the bulk of payments start to come due in the next four to six years,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Even if loan payments are deferred, they are going to continue to hang over Pakistan’s economic development potential, hamstringing Prime Minister (Imran) Khan’s reform agenda,” she said.</p>
      <p>The United States has gone on the offensive against China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a signature project of President Xi Jinping which aims to build ports, highways and railways around the world.</p>
      <p>But Wells’ speech was unusually specific in warning of risks to Pakistan, a historically of the United States which has had a turbulent relationship with Washington in recent years over Islamabad’s shady ties with Islamist militants.</p>
      <p>While acknowledging that the United States could not come to Pakistan with offers from state-run companies, Wells said private US investment, coupled with US grants, would improve the troubled economy’s fundamentals.</p>
      <p>“There is a different model,” she said. “Worldwide we see that US companies bring more than just capital; they bring values, processes and expertise that build the capacities of local economies.” She pointed to interest in Pakistan by US companies including Uber, Exxon Mobil, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, with the soft-drink makers together investing USD 1.3 billion in the country.</p>
      <p>China’s main promises in Pakistan include the development of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea into a world-class port.</p>
      <p>Beijing hopes to link Gwadar to the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, giving the world’s second largest economy more access to the oil-rich Middle East and reducing reliance on the dispute-ridden South China Sea.</p>
