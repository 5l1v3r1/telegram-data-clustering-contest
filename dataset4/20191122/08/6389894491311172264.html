      <p>Nationwide has posted a sharp fall in half-year profit following a final blow from payment protection insurance (PPI) charges and a low interest rate environment.</p>
      <p>Statutory profit for the six months to 30 September fell to £309m, sliding from £516m in the same period a year earlier.</p>

      <p>As well as suffering costs from a surge in PPI complaints, the building society’s profit was hit by lower income and investment costs.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Joe Garner told City A.M. that the biggest challenge in the year ahead will be pressure from low interest rates.</p>
      <p>“Interest rates have been below one per cent for over a decade now. That is fabulous news for borrowers and mortgage holders, but savers have for the last decade had a much worse time of things,” he said.</p>
      <p>Garner added that there are “no signs of any increase in rates on the horizon”.</p>
      <p>On Garner’s £2.3m pay package, the chief executive said: “The board sets the pay below what competitors and comparable firms would set.”</p>
      <p>He said: “I appreciate these are large sums of money but as a mutual building society members vote on pay and the vote was over 90 per cent in support”.</p>
      <p>On PPI, Nationwide took a final PPI charge of £36m in the first half of the financial year, in the middle of the £20-50m range previously announced.</p>
      <p>The firm’s net interest margin – a key measure of underlying profitability – fell from 1.23 per cent to 1.12 per cent.</p>
      <p>“Whilst the economic outlook remains uncertain, we expect the current low interest rates and competition in our core markets to continue,” it said.</p>
