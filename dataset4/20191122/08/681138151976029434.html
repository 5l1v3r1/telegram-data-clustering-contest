        <b>A man used a woman's bank card to buy items after it was stolen from her car in Woodbridge, a court heard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ben Fehily, 39, who is currently serving a 12-month sentence at Norwich Prison for burglary, pleaded guilty to one charge of fraud by false representation, and three counts of theft.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Magistrates' Court heard how Fehily, who appeared via video link, used the stolen card to buy goods worth £29.40 from a corner shop in Eye, and £25.20 from McColl's in Melton on December 13, 2018.</p>
      <p>A charge of theft from a motor vehicle - stealing the handbag and purse from the car - was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) at the hearing.</p>
      <p>Fehily also admitted stealing a quantity of meat products of value unknown from Sainsbury's in Cornard Road, Sudbury, on March 25.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded guilty to the theft of more meat products from the Co-op in Austin Street, Ipswich, on April 21.</p>
      <p>He also stole an outdoor garden egg chair, worth £200, from the B&amp;M store in Copdock earlier that month on April 3.</p>
      <p>Wayne Ablett, prosecuting, said Fehily was identified on CCTV.</p>
      <p>A further charge of theft from Next on Suffolk Retail Park, was dropped by the CPS.</p>
      <p>John Hughes, defending, said: "He has a long history of significant class A drug use, of which these offences are associated.</p>
      <p>"He has been doing a lot of drug work while in prison and is due to be released on January 13."</p>
      <p>Magistrates sentenced Fehily to six weeks' imprisonment for each offence to run concurrently alongside his current prison term.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered to pay £54.60 in compensation to the woman who had her bank card stolen and £100 to B&amp;M.</p>
