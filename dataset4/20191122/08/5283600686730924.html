      <h1>New EB-5 visa rules come into effect</h1>
      <h2>An EB-5 visa holder, who gets a green card, can choose any kind of work in the US</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:49:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:49</time> by <a rel="author">Nandana James</a></address>
      <p>The changes announced to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program - under which entrepreneurs may apply for a green card or permanent residence - has come into effect now.</p>
      <p>The changes in EB-5, under a new rule published by the United States (US) Department of Homeland Security, include a rise in the standard minimum investment amount from $1 million to $1.8 million as well as an increase in the minimum investment in a targeted employment area (TEA) to $900,000 from $500,000. </p>
      <p>This marks the first time, since 1993, that the rules have been altered significantly. <i>BusinessLine</i> had reported in August that the announcement of these changes had led to a surge in Indian applicants for the EB-5 Visa, ahead of the fee hike. This fee hike came into effect yesterday.</p>
      <p>Read: <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/rise-in-indian-applicants-for-eb-5-visa-ahead-of-november-fee-hike/article28928790.ece">Rise in Indian applicants for EB-5 visa ahead of November fee hike</a></p>
      <p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in its site explains the other changes that the EB-5 program will now incorporate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing priority date retention to certain EB-5 investors</li>
        <li>Increasing the required minimum investment amounts to account for inflation</li>
        <li>Reforming certain targeted employment area (TEA) designations</li>
        <li>Clarifying USCIS procedures for the removal of conditions on permanent residence</li>
        <li>Making other technical and conforming revisions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, administered by the USCIS, is a program under which entrepreneurs - and their spouses and unmarried children under 21 - are eligible to apply for a green card (permanent residence) if they make the necessary investment in a commercial enterprise in the US and if they plan to create or preserve 10  permanent full-time jobs for qualified US workers. This program is known as EB-5 for the name of the employment-based fifth preference visa that participants receive, the USCIS website states.</p>
      <p>Better education and career prospects for children is an important reason why Indians have traditionally opted for the EB-5 visa. An EB-5 visa holder, who gets a green card, can choose any kind of work in the US.</p>
      <p>India had reached retrogression for EB-5 in June 2019, with the country having utilised the existing cap of 700 visas offered by the US government to every country for the US fiscal year 2018 (October-September). This had happened amidst tight scrutiny over H-1B and H4 (dependent visa) and the ongoing trade war between the two countries then. Visa retrogression occurs when the demand for a particular immigrant visa for a nation exceeds its availability.</p>
      <p>EB-5 players in the market shared their opinion on the implications of these changes.</p>
      <h3>Varied opinions</h3>
      <p>Despite hike in prices and high risk for investors, the new rules may not drive investments home, partially as a bulk of E-B 5 demand comes from Indians already residing in the US, Vivek Tandon Founder and CEO of EB5 BRICS, an EB-5 advisory firm had said in August. “There may be a dip in the short-term but the program will continue to remain very popular with Indians. Considering the current chaotic H-1B setup and the long waiting periods for EB-1 to EB-3 category green cards, the EB-5 visa, despite the increased investment threshold, remains the most stable and most transparent route to the US green card. Further, the bulk of Indian EB-5 demand comes for those already in the US on work permits or with pending green card applications. For them, the benefits of a US green card far outweigh the costs, even after this recent increase in investments,” he explained.</p>
      <p>That TEAs will now be authorised by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rather than the State based on ‘revised requirements in the regulation’ was also identified by Tandon as a very significant change, may be even more significant than the investment hike.</p>
      <p>“Post November 21, TEAs shall be designated solely by the DHS based on a uniform criteria for the entire country. Further, the new rules clarify that there cannot be any TEAs in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with a population in excess of 20,000. Going ahead, Indians will either have to invest in rural areas or high-unemployment areas outside cities or skip the $900,000 option and invest $1.8 million for the EB-5 visa. This change actually increases the risk for Indian investors because risks involved in setting up a viable project in non-urban areas will be significantly higher,” he had said.</p>
      <p>With the EB-5 visa category facing longer waiting times and increased costs, its Indian clients are now looking at the E-2 via, said Mark Davies, Global Chairman, Davies &amp; Associates LLC. “Although Indians are not directly eligible for the E-2 Visa, we have successfully managed to help clients obtain an E-2 Visa by first taking Citizenship by Investment of an E2-eligible country like Grenada in the West Indies,” he said.</p>
      <p>He further stated that the E-2 visa is highly complementary to the EB-5 application, as it allows a person to live and work in the United States while facing retrogression delays. “If the underlying E-2 business becomes large enough, it is possible to transition it to a Green Card under the EB-5 route,” he said. </p>
      <p>Brennen McConnell, Partner, Paragon Partners Asia, said that even with the price increase, the EB-5 program is still a more affordable option than many of the comparable programs in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and elsewhere. “There is also additional positive news for Indian EB-5 investors as the US government admitted its worst-case wait time estimates for Indians are actually two years less than what had been originally projected earlier in 2019,” he said.</p>
      <p>The other major change to the EB-5 program is the tightening of the definition of what constitutes a TEA, pointed out Matt Hogan, VP Project Development, CMB Regional Centers. “This is an integrity move designed to ensure that EB-5 money is being directed at areas of higher unemployment. It is vital for EB-5 investors to check that their chosen regional center project complies with the new TEA regulations,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rogelio Caceres, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-Founder, LCR Capital Partners, said that a price increase to reflect inflation is long overdue and one that LCR and the EB-5 industry should welcome enthusiastically. “Given the increase in amount, LCR fully expects a large number of EB-5 Regional Centers to exit the industry, especially ones that are not set up to attract a globally diversified investor base into institutional-grade, secure US opportunities,” said Caceres.</p>
      <p>LCR Capital Partners also views the price increase as a classic win-win scenario, he said. “It's a win to American businesses and communities who will now benefit from a larger investment amount to strengthen and accelerate job creation across the country.  According to II-USA, the industry's association, capital investments from EB-5 investors fueled over 4 per cent of new job growth across the entire country,” said Caceres.</p>
      <p>"The price increase is also a win for investors," he said.</p>
      <p>Since the job requirement clause remains 10 new American jobs, the increase makes meeting this important requirement much less difficult to demonstrate, he pointed out.</p>
      <p>“Given the increase in amount, sophisticated investors will insist that these new investment offerings are structured with a focus on capital preservation and timely return on principal,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Qendrese Sadriu, Managing Director, American Immigration Group, pointed out that the changes to the regulations are part of an ongoing process and investors interested in EB-5 should maintain a watchful eye on the program. “This could be far from the last word,” he said.</p>
