      <h1>Charlie Nicholas offers his thoughts on striker Moise Kean’s slow start at Everton</h1>
      <h2>Kean came in from Juventus this summer but hasn’t lived up to expectations yet.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:45:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a> pundit Charlie Nicholas says that Everton summer signing Moise Kean is talking like he already wants to go back to Italy.</p>
      <p>He sent a message to Marco Silva ahead of the weekend clash against Norwich which covered the fortunes of his big summer signing up front, who has struggled since his arrival from Juventus.</p>
      <p>Nicholas <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">said of Silva</a>: “His breakdown of the last away game suggested he doesn’t seem to feel pressure at all – what a load of rubbish! I’ll tell you the reason why you feel pressure Mr Silva, in the last few games you have changed the team on a regular basis – you do not know your best starting team.</p>
      <p>“Moise Kean sounds as though he may be heading back to Italy, Cenk Tosun is back in the starting line-up, Richarlison is delivering with his goals and I always think he will get you double figures, Theo Walcott has been alright, but Gylfi Sigurdsson has been in and out.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Everton promised to look after Kean and his talent makes him worth persisting with</h3>
      <p>Marcel Brands promised Kean and his mother (<a href="https://twitter.com/Everton/status/1158452798104756229?s=20">@Everton</a>) upon signing for Everton that they would look after the striker.</p>
      <p>And he is one of Europe’s best young strikers in terms of talent, which makes him worth sticking with through a tricky start to his Toffees career.</p>
      <p>He isn’t the first player, especially a young one, not to take instantly to a new country and league and with Everton still searching for a prolific replacement for Romelu Lukaku, Kean still represents their best bet.</p>
