      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korea on Friday told the Japanese government it will continue to share real-time intelligence on North Korea, reversing an earlier decision to end a cooperation pact amid a spat over trade and history, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.</p>
      <p>South Korea had come under pressure from the United States to continue its General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan. Washington was concerned that a return to passing information through the U.S. military would have undermined efforts to respond to any threat posed by North Korean missiles.</p>
      <p>South Korea in August said it would end the GSOMIA after Japan slapped restrictions on exports to South Korea of materials necessary for semiconductor and display production.</p>
