      <p>A 29-year-old man accused of culpable homicide, Abbas Abubakar, of Kissayip Village in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State has explained why he killed his aunt, Fatima Maitala.</p>
      <p>Mr Abubakar was among the 36 suspects paraded by the state commissioner of police, Isaac Akinmoyede, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The commissioner said the 36 suspects were apprehended for alleged kidnapping, rape, possession of illegal firearms, culpable homicide, among others.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinmoyede said Mr Abubakar was arrested following a report to the police by Maitala Bako, the husband of the deceased who claimed his wife was shot dead by the suspect.</p>
      <p>‘Yes I did it’</p>
      <p>Mr Abubakar said he committed the crime.</p>
      <p>“Yes, I killed Fatima Maitala, who is a wife to my uncle. I killed her because; first, she was the one who killed one of my uncle’s ‘spiritually’. It is so because when my uncle was about to die, he mentioned her (Fatima ) severally. He would say ‘Fatima, Fatima, Fatima would kill me’. That was how I got to know she was the one who killed my uncle.</p>
      <p>“Secondly, she injected and killed my big cow. Before now, she told me categorically she would kill my cow and she did it.</p>
      <p>“Thirdly, she also vowed to kill me and my entire family and that was why I killed her,” Mr Abubakar said.</p>
      <p>Mr Abubakar said he regretted his action.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, police boss, Mr Akinmoyede, said the suspect “led police detectives to the place he hid the firearm he used in committing the dastardly act.</p>
      <p>“The detectives moved swiftly to the place and recovered one single barrel gun. The prime suspect will be charged to court,” the policeman said.</p>
