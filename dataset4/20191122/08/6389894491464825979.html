      <p>Fisher, who was behind Shazam’s international growth strategy, also holds non-executive director roles at Marks &amp; Spencer and Moneysupermarket.</p>
      <p>Rightmove CEO Peter Brooks-Johnson said: “I’d like to thank Scott for his invaluable contribution to Rightmove’s success over the past years and particularly the support he’s shown me over the past three years as CEO.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to welcome Andrew to Rightmove and look forward to working with him as we continue to innovate to make home moving easier.”</p>
      <p>Forbes added that he had “thoroughly enjoyed” working at Rightmove since 2005.</p>
      <p>“It is with great pleasure and confidence that I hand over the chair to Andrew,” Forbes said. “His experience developing innovative digital businesses will be a great asset to Rightmove.”</p>
      <p>Forbes’ departure was made inevitable by new corporate governance rules that state that company chairs lose their independence after more than nine years on a board.</p>
