      <p>Tesla on Thursday unveiled its electric pickup truck with a futuristic angular body in gunmetal gray that looked like an armored vehicle, as the California company took aim at the heart of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Detroit">Detroit</a> carmakers’ profits.</p>
      <p>With a starting price of $39,900, the Cyber truck is less expensive than initially flagged but its polarising design could limit sales in a segment symbolic of a rugged, practical American lifestyle.</p>
      <p>At a launch event in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Los+Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Tesla Chief Executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Elon+Musk">Elon Musk</a> said other versions will be priced at $49,900 and $69,900 with the most expensive offering a range of more than 500 miles (800 km). Production is expected to begin around late 2021.</p>

      <p>“We need sustainable energy now. If we don’t have a pickup truck, we can’t solve it. The top three selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks. To solve sustainable energy, we have to have a pickup truck,” he said.</p>
      <p>The truck’s hulking sharp geometric body was made from stainless steel, set atop massive tires and had windows made from armored glass.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mr+Musk">Mr Musk</a> claimed the truck’s “ultra-hard” exterior “won’t scratch and dent”. But the armored glass window cracked like a spider web when hit with a metal ball during a demonstration. Musk appeared surprised although he noted the glass had not completely broken.</p>
      <p>The truck marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 saloon is the world’s top-selling battery electric car, into pickup trucks, a market dominated by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ford+Motor">Ford Motor</a> Co’s F-150, along with models by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=General+Motors">General Motors</a> Co, and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Fiat">Fiat</a> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Chrysler">Chrysler</a>. - Reuters</p>
