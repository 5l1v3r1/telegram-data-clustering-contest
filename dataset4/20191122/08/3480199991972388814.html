      <p>Floyd Mayweather Jr has said he is coming out of retirement.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old American has not fought since the 50th fight and 50th win of his career in August 2017.</p>
      <p>That was over UFC star Conor McGregor, a fight found under boxing rules.</p>

      <p>A rematch, possibly under UFC rules, has long been touted, as have traditional ring returns against a number of opponents.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post, Mayweather – a five-weight world champion – simply said: “Coming out of retirement in 2020”.</p>

      <p>And hinting that his claimed return will be something more than a boxing one, he posted another picture with UFC boss Dana White, who helped promote the McGregor fight, saying the pair were “working together again”.</p>
