      <p>The father of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane has said the conviction of his daughter’s killer “will not reduce the pain and suffering” the family have endured since her death.</p>
      <p>David Millane said his daughter “will be missed forever” as he left Auckland High Court in New Zealand, almost a year after she was killed by a man she met on dating site Tinder, before he stuffed her lifeless body in a suitcase and disposed of it.</p>
      <p>The jury of seven women and five men took five hours to return a unanimous guilty verdict after a two-week trial.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old killer – who cannot be named – will be sentenced on February 21 when the judge will decide whether he can be identified.</p>
      <p>Ms Millane’s parents, David and Gillian, wept after the verdict was delivered, as did several jurors.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside court, an emotional Mr Millane said: “It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year.</p>
      <p>“Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>“Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever.”</p>
      <p>Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, met the man for a date in the centre of Auckland on December 1 2018.</p>
      <p>After several drinks, the pair returned to his apartment.</p>
      <p>She was killed either that night or in the early hours of the next morning – the date of her 22nd birthday.</p>

      <p>The Crown successfully argued the man strangled her and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>She was assumed missing, and her father flew to New Zealand as local authorities spent a week searching for her body until the discovery was made.</p>
      <p>Jurors rejected the defence claim that the death was accidental and occurred during rough sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p>The trial heard that the killer was initially interviewed by police because he left a comment on one of Ms Millane’s Facebook photos.</p>
      <p>He said the pair went their separate ways after their date.</p>
      <p>He later admitted Ms Millane was dead, but said he did not murder her. The killer then took police to where she was buried.</p>

      <p>During the trial, jurors heard from forensic experts who examined the accused’s apartment for blood stains as well as Ms Millane’s body.</p>
      <p>They were also shown footage of the woman and the defendant drinking at various bars in Auckland and kissing before they went to his apartment.</p>
      <p>Video footage from the elevator of her exiting on the third floor marked the last recorded time Ms Millane was seen alive.</p>
      <p>Police said phone data showed the killer had used Google to browse websites for large duffel bags, suitcases and car hire after Ms Millane died.</p>

      <p>His phone was also used to search for “flesh-eating birds” and “are there vultures in New Zealand?”.</p>
      <p>Records showed the defendant had searched online for “the hottest fire”, “large bags near me” and “Waitakere Ranges”.</p>
      <p>The killer was remanded into custody until his sentencing.</p>
      <p>He faces life in prison with a minimum of 10 years without parole, though the judge can increase the latter period.</p>
