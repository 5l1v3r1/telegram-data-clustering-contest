      <p>The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has received complaints that e-commerce companies are offering deep discounts, indulging in predatory pricing, exercising control over inventory and influencing the prices of goods sold on the platform, Parliament was informed on Friday.</p>
      <p>In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said that any violation of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-direct-investment">foreign direct investment </a>(FDI) regulations is covered by the penal provision of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/reserve-bank-of-india">Reserve Bank of India </a>(RBI) administers the FEMA and Directorate of Enforcement is the authority for the enforcement of the act.</p>
      <p>"Some representations have been received in this department, complaining that e-commerce companies are offering deep discounts, indulging in predatory pricing, engaging in B2C business, exercising control over inventory and influencing the prices of goods sold on the platform," he said.</p>
      <p>The onus of compliance of the provisions of FDI policy is on the investee entity.</p>
      <p>The policy is made legally enforceable through notifications under FEMA, 1999, by the RBI.</p>
      <p>In a separate reply on onions, the minister informed that the prohibition on export of onions has been imposed in view of the prevailing adverse domestic availability and price situation.</p>
      <p>"No report of adverse impact on onion growers in the country, particularly in Maharashtra, has been received in the ministry," he said.</p>
