      <p>A person was killed and another injured late Thursday after police officials opened fire on a vehicle in Karachi’s Frere Hall area.</p>
      <p>The police officials claimed that they were on patrol when they saw a vehicle and hailed it to stop, instead, the vehicle accelerated and drove off.</p>
      <p>However, the police officials reportedly opened fire without just cause. Addressing the media, SSP South Shiraz Nazir said the responsible officials were detained after the incident.</p>

      <p>“Evidence suggests that the car stopped in front of Frere Hall, after which police opened fire,” added the senior police official.</p>
      <p>The bullet struck the neck of the deceased, identified as Nabeel Hoodboy, and the same bullet then hit the arm of his friend Raza Imam.</p>
      <p>The police officials involved in the shooting were identified as Sub-Inspector Abdul Ghafoor, Head Constable Aftab and Constable Muhammad Ali Shah.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a two-year-old child was fatally shot during an encounter between police and dacoits in Karachi.</p>
      <p>Police claimed that the infant was killed in an exchange of fire between the law enforcement agency and robbers who were looting citizens.</p>
      <p>Four police officials were taken into custody after the incident.</p>
