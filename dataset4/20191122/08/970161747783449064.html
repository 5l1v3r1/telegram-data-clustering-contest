      <p>A brewery in Bristol has launched an initiative to help homeless people register to vote.</p>
      <p>Bristol Beer Factory is offering rough sleepers the chance to fill out a form at the Arnolfini art gallery, where their bar is based, ahead of the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Staff will then send off the forms, meaning anyone who filled one out is registered to vote at their address.</p>
      <p>They have also offered a hot drink to anyone who comes by to register.</p>
      <p>The team wrote online: ‘Don’t lose your vote. If you know any homeless people that would like to vote but don’t have an address they can use ours.</p>

      <p>The deadline for registering to vote is November 26, at 11.59pm.</p>
      <p>Anyone without a fixed address in the UK can still vote so long as they’re registered.</p>
      <p>This can be done by filling out a ‘Declaration of local connection’ form, which can be found at electoral registration offices or downloaded from GOV.UK.</p>
      <p>It then needs to be returned to the electoral registration office by hand, by post or by email.</p>

      <p>The government recommends choosing to register at an address you regularly visit or have access to, such as a hostel, a friend’s house or a day centre.</p>
      <p>Rough sleepers can also register at an address closest to where they spend most of their time, for example, a park bench, bus shelter or doorway.</p>
      <p>Anyone registered and eligible to vote can do so in person at a polling station, by post or by proxy, which means getting someone to vote for you.</p>
      <p>Applications for a postal or proxy vote can be done online or through the electoral registration office.</p>
