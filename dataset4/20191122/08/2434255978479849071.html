      <p>And sharing more pictures as she spent her first night up with her daughter, Rosanna shared an Instagram video taken at 4.41 am as she sat up cradling her baby girl.</p>
      <p>She also shared a sweet snap of her daughter's tiny legs and feet cradled in her hands as she wrote: "Completely besotted with Sophia, can't believe she is finally here! Thank you for all the kind messages".</p>
      <p>Rosanna and Wes revealed <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/rosanna-davison-wesley-quirke-expecting-18782400">they were having their first child</a> via gestational surrogate earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Rosanna told her 153k social media followers back in July: "Half you and half me @wesquirke &amp; I are overjoyed to share the news that we’re expecting a baby girl in November (by gestational surrogate) As our families &amp; close friends know, this has been a long &amp; very tough journey for us, sadly with multiple miscarriages along the way."</p>

      <p>"We’ve dreamed of being parents for many years and I would have loved to carry my own baby, but for reasons unknown (most likely embryo rejection due to an overactive immune system) &amp; although tests show excellent fertility, I’ve been unable to sustain any of my <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/pregnancy">pregnancies</a> , despite the best efforts of reproductive immunology experts &amp; a lot of immune-suppressant medication, injections, intravenous infusions &amp; surgery.</p>
      <p>"Following medical advice, gestational surrogacy abroad became our only viable option for a biological child &amp; we’re so thankful for the wonders of modern medicine &amp; reproductive science."</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/wicklow">Wicklow</a> native recently opened up to RSVP Live about her and Wes's decision to go down the surrogacy route after the model was diagnosed with an immune system issue.</p>
      <p>Saying it was a "long journey" and not an easy process, Rosanna told us: "By February when we are finished the legal side, it will have been a two year journey for us.</p>
      <p>"We began surrogacy in February 2018 so it does take a while.</p>
      <p>"We have had a challenging few years trying to get to the bottom of my immune system issues, and that still isn’t figured out."</p>
