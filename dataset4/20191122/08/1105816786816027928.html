      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>An accountability court in Lahore on Friday granted PML-N Vice-president Maryam Nawaz and ailing former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, exemption from appearing before the court in Chaudhry Sugar Mills case, said <a href="https://www.express.pk/story/1890638/1/"><i>Express News</i></a>.</p>

      <p>The court resumed hearing the case today during which separate applications were submitted on behalf of Nawaz and Maryam, requesting it to exempt them from court appearances until the filing of the reference. The court later accepted their pleas.</p>
      <p>The former premier was granted an exemption for four weeks whereas his daughter Maryam, who appeared in the court today, was granted an exemption from court appearances until the reference in the case is filed.</p>

      <p>The PML-N supremo was taken into custody earlier in October from Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat prison – where he is already incarcerated and serving time in the Avenfield case.</p>
      <p>On November 19, Nawaz, accompanied by his brother Shehbaz Sharif, went to London to continue with his medical treatment. The government and the Sharif family remained at odds over the removal of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s name from the no-fly list. However, the matter was resolved after the Lahore High Court (LHC) allowed Nawaz to fly abroad without an indemnity bond.</p>

        <b>Maryam not a beneficiary of Chaudhary Sugar Mills, court told</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nawaz had been granted bail by the Islamabad High Court on humanitarian grounds in the Al Azizia case and by the LHC in the Chaudhry Sugar Mills case, in which he is a suspect.</p>
      <p>Earlier in August this year, NAB had also arrested Maryam and Yousuf Abbas in the same case.</p>
