        <b>David Warner made his first century since his year's ban from cricket as his 151 not out gave Australia control against Pakistan in the first Test.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 33-year-old appeared to be caught behind on 56 at the Gabba, but 16-year-old bowler Naseem Shah's delivery was ruled a no-ball on replay.</p>
      <p>Warner survived another scare on 93 when he was nearly run out by a direct hit from the deep in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>But Australia ended the day on top, 72 runs ahead with nine wickets in hand.</p>
      <p>Warner, who scored just 95 runs in 10 innings in last summer's Ashes series, last made a Test century in the 2017 Boxing Day Test against England.</p>
      <p>He has spent much of the intervening period on the international sidelines after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/46272488">being banned for 12 months for ball-tampering against South Africa.</a></p>
      <p>He was ably supported by fellow opener Joe Burns, who fell three runs short of his own century after being deceived by Yasir Shah's leg break.</p>
      <p>That opening stand of 222 pulled Australia within sight of Pakistan's first-innings total and Marnus Labuschagne's assured 55 not out pushed the game further out of the tourists' reach.</p>
