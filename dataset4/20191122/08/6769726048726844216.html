      <p>FROM bubble wrap to garbage bags and magazine covers, sustainable fashion was on display at <a href="https://www.hillcrestps.wa.edu.au/">Hillcrest Primary School’s</a> annual recycled fashion parade.</p>
      <p>Year 3 and 4 students blitzed the audience with their stunning recycled garments, fashion house concepts and catwalks accompanied by music from the likes of Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello and Korean boy band BTS on November 22.</p>
      <p>Students used recycled bags, magazine covers, wires, thread, bubble wrap and plastic items to create dresses, skirts, shirts, capes and accessories.</p>
      <p>Teacher Yvonne Rogers said students created “amazing” garments and accessories for the parade.</p>
      <p>“Not only have they created some stunningly creative designs, each child wrote the commentary that accompanied their catwalk presentation, rehearsed walking like a catwalk model, chose the music, made business cards to promote their fashion houses, wrote a business and design brief that described their unique fashion house and also researched a designer that inspired them,” she said.</p>
