      <p><b>SAS</b> is now launching a new packaging of the award-winning New Nordic by SAS food concept. The new design of the cube will save up to 51 tons of plastics per year. This is one of many important steps toward reaching SAS goal of having 100 percent sustainable materials in the customer offering no later than 2030.</p>
      <p> With the emphasis on a contemporary in-air dining experience, using locally produced and seasonal ingredients, New Nordic by SAS has had a sustainability focus since it was launched in 2017. The packaging will now be re-launched as of November 21st with a new design and more sustainable materials.</p>
      <p>“<i>Every day we develop our service offering and constantly evaluate everything we load onboard. We remove what is not needed and work to find innovative solutions for our materials and packaging</i>,” says <b>Karl Sandlund</b>, EVP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
      <p>Some form of plastic is often necessary due to food safety requirements. Therefore, the suppliers of SAS have come up with a solution that replaces the inside plastic container of the cube with a paper one. It is made of FSC approved paper with a plastic coating, made from organic plant-based plastic instead of oil-based plastic.</p>
      <p>“<i>The New Nordic by SAS food concept served in the cube is an excellent example of how we align our onboard services with our sustainability goals. It is one of many steps toward a more sustainable aviation – the most significant actions being the renewal of our fleet, increasing biofuel use and supporting the development of electric aircraft</i>,” says Karl Sandlund.</p>
      <p>The cutlery kit in the cube has also been changed. The new kits are adapted to each meal in order to minimize use of resources, meaning that each piece of cutlery is offered only if needed. It will be launched gradually starting in December 2019 and by May 2020 the new cutlery will be found in every cube.</p>
      <p>The plant-based plastic used in the cutlery is made from vegetable oil, which is processed by natural fermentation and micro-organisms into a raw material that is compostable. SAS is proud to be the first in presenting this innovative solution for single use cutlery, the only plastic solution compliant with the European SUP (Single Use Plastics) directive.</p>
      <p>Instead of putting the wet wipe in each cube, it will now be offered upon request. Instead of a plastic wrap to contain the cutleries, paper napkins made from recycled material will be used for wrapping.</p>
      <p>Replacing materials is an important part of SAS work as every step counts on the journey toward a more sustainable air travel. Other initiatives for example, include the removal off tax-free sales and increased availability of pre-order meals to reduce waste and weight. </p>
