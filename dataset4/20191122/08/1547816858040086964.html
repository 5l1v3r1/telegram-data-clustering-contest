      <p>Are you following Sara Ali Khan’s Instagram account? If not, we would suggest to do it right away and tell don’t you think this lady really knows how to make the most of her vacation? Months ago, Sara had a mini-vacation in Sri Lanka with her mother Amrita Singh and brother Ibrahim Ali Khan, where she called herself as the ‘Lady in Lanka.’ And look, she is off again for another vacation which is totally making us jealous. The Kedarnath actress took some time off from her Coolie No.1 shooting schedule and used that opportunity by going on a vacation with her friends this time.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old actress has even shared a few photos on her handle which is all about fun, food, chilling and friendship. Apart from these, we would like to add ‘conquer’ too as that is what the Simmba actress is currently doing in New York. Yes, no kidding. She recently shared a photo on her story where she is seen facing her back to the camera while spreading her arms in the sky which appears to be hugging the New York city but instead, she is conquering as she captioned the image as ‘#Conquer’. Check out the picture below:</p>

      <p>She has also been treating us with friendship-filled photos on her handle. In one picture, Ms Khan is seen pouting with a friend while flaunting her black lipstick. While on another one, she is seen posing against the backdrop of a graffiti while leaning on a lamp post.    </p>
