      <h3>Frankenstein</h3>
      <p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/draculas-favorite-weirdo-will-get-his-own-universal-monster-movie-renfield">Dracula’s manservant getting his own solo film</a>, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3594869/james-wan-assembling-new-take-frankenstein/">Bloody-Disgusting</a> claims that there was a deleted item in that same Variety report that mentioned James Wan is currently attached to produce a new take on <i>Frankenstein</i> for Universal. We’ll keep an eye out for more on this.</p>

      <h3>It: Chapter 3</h3>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/it-chapter-two-writer-gary-dauberman-talks-spinoff-possibilities-and-that-rumored-supercut-exclusive-a171703">Comic Book Movie</a>, screenwriter Gary Dauberman stated he thinks “it’s possible” Pennywise could return for a third, all-new movie merely inspired by the Stephen King novel.</p>
      <blockquote>I do think it’s possible. Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me but there’s only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie. It’s just a question of whether or not people want to see it but I do think It was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that’s a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell and I think you could do that for sure.</blockquote>
