      <p>The Parrys International Wolves skipper is back with the Monmore men for a fourth straight season, joining fellow Aussie Ryan Douglas on the teamsheet so far. The news comes just a couple of weeks after Schlein announced his 20th season in Britain will be his last.</p>
      <p>And the 35-year-old has told how he never thought of joining any other top-flight side.</p>
      <p>Now he aims to go out with a bang with a club he says he huge amounts of respect for.</p>
      <p>“It was so easy to get the deal done,” Schlein said. “There were no ifs or buts or any long discussions really, I just saw the dotted line and signed away.</p>
      <p>“When a rider gets comfortable and knows how a team and a club operates they just feel settled.</p>
      <p>“That’s how I feel at Wolves and it’s just got such a good vibe.</p>
      <p>“The club suits me well and I have a great relationship with Pete (Adams – team manager) and Chris (Van Straaten – promoter).</p>
      <p>“It’s always been a pleasure to ride at Wolves, even as an away rider, and to spend what will be my final year in British Speedway there will be great.</p>
      <p>“I know I’ll be able to enjoy myself being back there and hopefully myself and the team can find a little bit more consistency.</p>
      <p>“I’m really looking forward to the year as I say and with some of the plans Chris and Pete have got, it should be a good one for the club and for the fans in particular too.”</p>
