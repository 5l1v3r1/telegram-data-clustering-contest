      <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has suspended the effectiveness of its notice given to Japan on terminating an intelligence sharing agreement, Yonhap news reported on Friday quoting an unnamed key ruling party official.</p>
      <p>The decision, which would effectively put on hold an earlier step by Seoul to terminate the intelligence agreement made after Japanâ€™s move to impose export curbs, was made because Japan has shown willing for dialogue, the official was quoted as saying.</p>
