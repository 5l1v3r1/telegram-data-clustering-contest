      <h1>CONFIRMED: 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' axed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:45:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – This year's<i> Victoria's Secret Fashion Show</i> has officially been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The news comes after a conference call on Thursday in which chief financial officer and executive vice president of L Brands, Stuart Burgdoerfer, confirmed the news, reports <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50512414"><b>BBC</b></a>. "We're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers," Burgdoerfer said.</p>
      <p>The show's ratings have dropped significantly with the 2018 broadcast having the lowest ratings ever. It's also garnered a lot of controversy in recent years for promoting skimpy underwear on super slim models.</p>
      <p>The show also received backlash last year when then-chief marketing officer Ed Razek made comments about the trans community.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year there was <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/victorias-secret-fashion-show-axed-for-2019-20190731"><b>speculation that the show would be cancelled</b></a> as L Brands said they were "rethinking" things.</p>
      <p>Model and angel, Shanina Shaik also alluded to the cancellation back in July but added, "I'm sure in the future something will happen... I'm sure they're trying to work on branding and new ways to do the show because it's the best show in the world." </p>
