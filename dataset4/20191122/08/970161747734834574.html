      <p>Liam Hemsworth’s sister-in-law Elsa Pataky has claimed the actor ‘deserves more’ following his split from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a>.</p>
      <p>Liam, 29, and Miley, 26, confirmed in August that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split-less-year-marriage-love-officially-dead-10551978/">they had split after eight months of marriage</a> and 10 years of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> on and off.</p>
      <p>While The Hunger Games star Liam went back to Australia to spend time with his big brother Chris, Miley embarked on two new relationships – first with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kaitlynn-carter/">Kaitlynn Carter</a>, then with Cody Simpson.</p>
      <p>And Chris’s wife Elsa has made it clear she’s on Team Liam.</p>
      <p>According to Hola! magazine, the 43-year-old told press at the Madrid launch of Women’s Secret’s KissMas Time range: ‘My brother in law, well, after a relationship where he dedicated 10 years, he’s discouraged … but he’s taking it well.</p>

      <p>Elsa – who has three kids with Avengers star Chris – went on to discuss how the Hemsworths had been supporting Liam during the rough time.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Family is always there to protect you. He and his brother are so close and he’s really been there for him to give him the strength he needs.’</p>
      <p>Elsa reportedly isn’t the only Hemsworth with hard feelings towards Liam’s ex-wife, with a source previously telling Hollywood Life that t<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/relieved-liam-hemsworths-mum-never-approved-miley-cyrus-cant-stop-cringing-10918242/">he star’s mum Leonie never approved of the Wrecking Ball singer.</a></p>

      <p>They said: ‘His mom is feeling so relieved that Liam made the decision to end the relationship as his entire family, but her especially, always struggled approving Miley.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Miley’s rep confirmed: ‘Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time.</p>
      <p>‘Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what’s best while they both focus on themselves and careers.</p>
      <p>‘They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy.’</p>
      <p>The couple had only tied the knot in December 2018, in an intimate ceremony at their home.</p>

      <p>While Miley packed on the PDA with Kaitlynn, Liam retreated to Byron Bay, where he was spotted surfing and spending time with his big brother.</p>
      <p>However, the actor seems to be moving on, having been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/12/liam-hemsworth-new-girlfriend-maddison-brown-enjoy-passionate-pda-night-pals-10908495/">pictured on a date with Dynasty actress Maddison Brown.</a></p>
