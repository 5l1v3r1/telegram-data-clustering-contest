      <p>Browne announced the news with a <a href="https://limerickgaa.ie/paul-browne-announces-inter-county-retirement/">statement on the Limerick GAA website</a> last night, noting that “the time is right” to step away. </p>
      <p>The Bruff midfielder was part of John Kiely’s Treaty squad that ended a 45-year wait for Liam MacCarthy glory in 2018 — though he missed out on action through injury. </p>
      <p>Vice-captain in their All-Ireland winning season, a devastating cruciate injury ruled him out for much of the season.</p>
      <p>30-year-old Browne made his championship debut in 2009, and departs the Limerick set-up with two Munster medals (2013 and 2019), Division 1 title — also from the season gone by — and a Division 2 honour from 2011.</p>
      <p>Browne’s statement, in full, reads:</p>
      <p>“I have decided that the time is right for me to step away form the Limerick Senior Hurling Panel after eleven seasons involved.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank my club Bruff Gaa, fellow club colleagues, coaches and mentors for their support. I hope to repay that support over the coming years. To the teachers and staff in Scoil Dean Cussen and FCJ Bruff I am extremely grateful for their encouragement in my younger years.</p>

      <p>“I would like to thank my employers LIT who have been very accommodating since I commenced my employment there.</p>
      <p>“Over the course of my playing career I went through several surgical procedures and I would like to thank the Limerick County Board and Senior Medical Team of Mark Van Drumpt, Mark Melbourne and Dr James Ryan for the care I received.</p>
      <blockquote>I leave with nothing but wonderful memories and pride from my eleven years playing with Limerick. To have shared the dressing room with all my past team-mates and this incredible panel of players now has been the greatest honour of my life.</blockquote>
