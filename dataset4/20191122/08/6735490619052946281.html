      <p>Christopher Walken is tired of being asked if he wants more cowbell.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Will Ferrell appeared on “The Tonight Show”, reminiscing with host Jimmy Fallon about their time on Global’s <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/saturday-night-live/">“Saturday Night Live”</a>.</p>
      <p>Among the sketches they brought up was the famous “More Cowbell”, which featured Walken as a music producer demanding “more cowbell” during the recording of “Don’t Fear the Reaper”.</p>

      <p>“Here’s the crazy thing,” Ferrell told Fallon. “I go to see Christopher Walken years later, in a play. I say hello to him backstage and he’s like, ‘You know, you’ve ruined my life.’”</p>
      <p>He continued, imitating Walken, “‘People during curtain call bring cowbells. The other day I went for Italian food for lunch, and the waiter asked if I wanted more cowbell with my pasta bolognese.’ I think he’s really mad.”</p>

      <p>Fallon also had Ferrell join him for a game of “Whisper Challenge”, in which one person wears headphones and has to guess a simple phrase the other person is reading out loud.</p>
      <p>Things quickly went off the rails as Ferrell began reading off a long speech, beginning with, “I have a shoplifting problem.”</p>
      <p>Later, instead of reading the name “Rum Tum Tugger”, Ferrell told a hilarious story about Fallon stealing his identity and starting a cult worshipping the actor Jonathan Lipnicki.</p>
