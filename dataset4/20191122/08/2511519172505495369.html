      <h2>British actor wants 'someone else to have a go'</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DanielCraig">Daniel Craig</a> has revealed he is officially done playing <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JamesBond">James Bond</a>.</p>
      <p>The actor, when asked if his time as the British spy was up, said: "Yes – someone else needs to have a go."</p>
      <p>Previous Bond film <i>Spectre</i> (2015) was rumoured to be Craig's final Bond outing, but he signed up to his fourth – Cary Joji Fukunaga's <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/no-time-to-die"><i>No Time to Die</i></a> – last year, and said he's "really happy" he did so.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of new film <i>Knives Out</i>, Craig told German website <a href="https://www.express.de/news/promi-und-show/daniel-craig-spricht-klartext--james-bond-muss-in-zukunft-ein-anderer-machen--33480522"><i>Express</i></a>: “It’s been, as they always are, incredibly hard work, but it’s a massive collaboration. One of the most moving things for me about finishing the film is that I have been working with some of the people for 30 years.”</p>
      <p>He added that the people he worked alongside is "what it was all about," suggesting he did the film to "say goodbye" to "those people".  </p>
      <p>It was revealed earlier this year that Christoph Waltz will reprise his role of <i>Spectre</i> character Blofeld in the 25th Bond film, alongside <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rami-malek">Rami Malek</a>, Lea Seydoux, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/naomie-harris-interview-skyfall-james-bond-moonlight-a9183936.html">Naomie Harris</a>, Ben Whishaw and Ana de Armas.</p>
      <p>Ralph Fiennes and Jeffrey Wright will also star, as will Lashana Lynch, who is said to be introduced in the film as a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/james-bond-25-lashana-lynch-female-007-daniel-craig-no-time-to-die-a9188956.html">"female version"</a> of 007.</p>
      <p>Among those expected to succeed Craig as Bond are Aidan Turner, Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston.</p>
