        <b>Former five-weight boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather says he is "coming out of retirement in 2020".</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5J0IMTlUYt/">Mayweather, 42, made the announcement</a> on social media after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Jwv_MFLJi/">an earlier message</a> that he was in talks with UFC president Dana White.</p>
      <p>"Dana White and I are working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020," he said.</p>
      <p>Mayweather's last outing saw him win <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46724047">an exhibition boxing match</a> against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.</p>
      <p>That fight took place in December 2018 and the American needed just 140 seconds to beat his opponent in a bout worth a reported $9m (Â£7m).</p>
      <p>Mayweather also came out of retirement in 2017 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/41064767">to beat UFC fighter Conor McGregor</a> in the Irishman's first ever boxing match.</p>
