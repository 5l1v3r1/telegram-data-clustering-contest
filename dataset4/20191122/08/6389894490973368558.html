      <p>Land Securities announced on Friday that Robert Noel is stepping down as chief executive, just 10 days after the property developer reported a first-half loss.</p>
      <p>Mark Allan, chief executive of St Modwen Properties and former boss of student accommodation company Unite, has been appointed as Noel’s replacement.</p>

      <p>“I am delighted to announce that Mark is to join Landsec as our next chief executive,” said Land Securities chairman Cressida Hogg.</p>
      <p>Land Securities, the UK’s largest commercial landlord, has an £13.8bn property portfolio including Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.</p>
      <p>The company recently posted a first-half loss after a string of store closures hit the developer.</p>
      <p>Land Securities has been refocusing its portfolio towards its profitable London business as it grapples with struggling regional assets.</p>
      <p>Allan will take up the role before June next year, and the company said Noel’s departure date would be announced in due course.</p>
      <p>Land Securities announced in July that Noel would retire after ten years at the company and eight as chief executive.</p>
      <p>Hogg praised Noel’s “successful leadership of Landsec” and “continued commitment to the business.”</p>
      <p>“Landsec is an iconic property company with a fantastic heritage and I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead it,” said Allan.</p>

      <p>“The world of real estate is undergoing significant change and I am confident, with the skills and experience already in place, that great opportunities lie ahead. I am looking forward to working with everyone at Landsec, the Board and its partners and customers.”</p>
      <p>Land Securities’ shares rose 0.51 per cent in morning trading following the announcement.</p>
