      <p>When you’re an A-lister who has to fly around the world several times a month, you can fall victim to some of the less desirable side-effects of travelling – namely, dehydrated ears like Chris Hemsworth.</p>
      <p>The actor, 36, shared videos of his personal assistant and fitness trainer playing an epic prank on him <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/harry-potter-star-rupert-grint-chris-hemsworth-smiles-arrive-tokyo-11197490/">during a recent flight to Tokyo</a> to help him overcome his dry ear issues.</p>
      <p>While Chris had left his seat for a minute, his pals recorded themselves putting some moisturiser on the inside of his in-flight headphones.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They told the camera: ‘Put a bit of moisturiser on the old ear… rub it in,’ adding ‘Now put them together so you can’t see it.’</p>
      <p>They then recorded poor, poor unsuspecting Chris chucking the boobytrapped headphones on to watch something on the in-flight entertainment, and totally not getting why his mates were suddenly killing themselves laughing on either side of him.</p>
      <p>He turned to either of them, asking: ‘What?! Did you spray me?’ before realising they’d sabotaged his headphones.</p>
      <p>Chris told them: ‘Oh f**king hell! D**kheads!’ as he wiped the cream off his ears and hair.</p>

      <p>Luckily, he saw the funny side of it, posting the evidence on Instagram and telling his followers: ‘One of the most common side effects of frequent air travel is dehydrated ears. Thanks @azzagrist @zocobodypro for always having my back…. and my ears.’</p>
      <p>Chris is probably used to these kind of pranks, given that he’s been friends with his personal assistant Aaron Grist and fitness trainer Luke Zocchi<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/avengers-chris-hemsworth-angel-child-celebrates-mums-birthday-throwback-11166695/"> since they all went to the same primary school when they were little</a>.</p>

      <p>The actor told Stuff.co.nz last year: ‘They’re a couple of mates of mine from school. We went to Heathmont College and Ringwood Primary School, played football together and now we travel the world together. It’s a pretty cool thing.’</p>
      <p>That does sound awesome… even if it comes with a side of an earful of moisturiser.</p>
