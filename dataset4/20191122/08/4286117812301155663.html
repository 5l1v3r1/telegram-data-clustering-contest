      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Uddhav Thackeray doesn't say if he'll be CM</li>
        <li>Will take decision at right time: Uddhav</li>
        <li>Sena-NCP-Congress meeting later today</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday accused the BJP of lying, as he blamed his old ally for a recent breakdown in ties and told his MLAs a new alliance would be finalised by evening.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena has working to cobble together an alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress since it fell out with the BJP.</p>
      <p>At a meeting with Shiv Sena MLAs, Uddhav Thackeray didn't reveal if he would lead the prospective coalition as chief minister, although there's been a chorus of demands for him to take on the role.</p>
      <p>He said he would take a decision at the right time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Samajwadi Party, which has 2 MLAs and is allied with the Congress-NCP combine, has asked for reservations for Muslims.</p>
      <p>It also wants the Shiv Sena to abandon Hindutva.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra has been under President's Rule since November 12, following a nearly three-week-long political deadlock caused by rift in ties between the BJP and the Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Raj Bhavan sources say Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is likely to skip a conference of governors that begins Saturday in Delhi, and remain in Mumbai.</p>
