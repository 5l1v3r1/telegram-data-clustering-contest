      <p>Reverend Dr. Rose Hudson-Wilkin has made history by becoming the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/church-of-england">Church of England</a>’s first black female bishop. </p>
      <p>Dr. Hudson-Wilkin was consecrated as the Bishop of Dover at a ceremony at St Paul’s Cathedral in London, the UK earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Jamaican-born religious leader was also the first woman to be appointed to the position of Chaplain to the Speaker of the UK’s House of Commons, reports <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/commons-chaplain-becomes-church-of-england-s-first-black-female-bishop-a4290916.html">Evening Standard</a>.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hudson-Wilkin also served as a priest in the London Borough of Hackney for more than a decade and led prayers at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May 2018. She is also a chaplain to Queen Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old who joined the ministry at the age of 14 was quoted by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-50478481"><i>BBC</i></a> as saying: “Beginning this new ministry, there is a sense of awe in it all. But also something refreshing about being open to the new things that God has in store – not just for me as a person taking on this new leadership role, but for our diocese as a whole.”</p>
      <p>The Most Rev Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said through much struggle and suffering in her life Hudson-Wilkin “has become one of the most exceptional of Christian leaders showing, in word and deed, confidence in Jesus Christ as life, liberty, and love.”</p>
      <p>“We welcome her, warmly confident that God who has led her this far will walk with her and speak through her.”</p>
      <p>Hudson-Wilkin will be installed at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 November.</p>
