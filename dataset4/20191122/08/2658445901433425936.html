      <p>The Zimbabwean government on Friday said it has so far fired 435 junior doctors at public hospitals for engaging in an illegal strike.</p>
      <p>The doctors have been on strike since early September to demand better pay and improved working conditions.</p>
      <p>The Labor Court in October declared the strike illegal, but the doctors have been defiant and continued with the strike, paralysing operations at major public health institutions in the country.</p>

      <p>The Health Service Board has 45 more disciplinary cases to handle for the doctors.</p>
      <p>Acting information minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu told reporters at a news briefing that the government has always been open to dialogue with the doctors and that firing them was a last resort.</p>
