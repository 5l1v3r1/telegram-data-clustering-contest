      <h1>Vivo S1 Pro to feature a similar quad-camera setup as the V17 Pro</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:48:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/18/vivo-s1-pro-malaysia-launch-very-soon/">Vivo S1 Pro</a> is coming to Malaysia very soon and the launch is taking place on 3rd December 2019. The S1 Pro is their new mid-range quad-camera smartphone and it is positioned as an improved version of the current <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/07/24/vivo-s1-malaysia-official-launch/">Vivo S1</a>.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the launch, Vivo Malaysia has confirmed its hardware specs via its <a href="https://www.vivo.com/my/products/param/s1pro">product page</a>. Similar to the Indonesian market, the device will feature a 6.38″ Full HD+ Super AMOLED display and it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor. The device also comes in a single variant that offers 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>

      <p>For taking pictures, the S1 Pro comes with a rather odd quad-camera arrangement that resembles a cube rotated at a 45-degree angle. It will feature a 48MP main camera that uses a Samsung GM1 sensor that shoots 12MP images by default in 4-in-1 mode. It also comes with an 8MP f/2.2 ultra-wide-camera, a 2MP f/2.4 macro shooter and a 2MP f/2.4 bokeh camera.</p>
      <p>The cameras are similar to the more expensive Vivo V17 Pro which is priced at <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/01/vivo-v17-pro-malaysia-price-availability-features-specs/">RM1,699</a>. For selfies, it will come with a 32MP f/2.0 front camera that sits on a tiny notch.</p>

      <p>Powering the device is a rather large 4,500mAh battery which is similar to the S1 but this time, it charges via a USB-C port. The device will be offered in two colour options – Fancy Sky and Knight Black.</p>
      <p>We still don’t know its official pricing and you can check out the full details on their <a href="https://www.vivo.com/my/products/s1pro">product page</a>. As a comparison, the current Vivo S1 was launched at RM1,099 and it is currently going for <a href="https://www.vivostore.com.my/single-product.php?p=201">RM999</a>.</p>
