      <h1>Norovirus strikes 60 schools with over 300 people falling sick</h1>

      <p>About 60 schools in north-east England have been hit by a suspected outbreak of norovirus.</p>
      <p>Some schools in the region had to shut last week and undergo a ‘deep clean’, after hundreds of staff and pupils were hit with vomiting, diarrhoea and flu-like symptoms.</p>
      <p>Public Health England (PHE) said it was not able to give an exact figure of the amount of schools which have been affected, nor their location.</p>
      <p>However, figures published by PHE on Thursday suggested norovirus rates are 26 per cent higher at the moment than they usually are at this time of year.</p>
      <p>Between October 28 and November 10, a total of 332 people were reported to have suffered with the highly contagious bug.</p>

      <p>A total of 18 outbreaks caused hospital wards to close or to restrict admissions across England and Wales.</p>

      <p>PHE said it expects these types of bugs to go round schools and workplaces during this time of year, as norovirus is predominantly a ‘winter pathogen’.</p>
      <p>The public has been urged not to go to A&amp;E or their GP with symptoms as the virus could easily spread.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a Lego event in Bristol had to be closed after a number of visitors were struck down with a sickness bug which had all the symptoms of norovirus.</p>
      <p>One person who attended the Brick Show on November 16 and 17 told Bristol Live they knew of at least 40 people who had been affected following the event.</p>
      <p>The ‘devastated’ organisers issued a statement on Facebook saying: ‘Unfortunately there were no reports of sickness made during the duration of the show, therefore we had no way of warning anyone nor identifying a source at the time’.</p>
      <p>Hospitals in Swansea, Warwickshire and Devon have reportedly had to close, along with several schools in the north of England.</p>

      <p>St Mary’s Catholic Primary School in Jarrow, South Tyneside, and St Mark’s Church of England School in Stockton, Teeside, closed for two days to disinfect the premises.</p>
      <p>Burnopfield Primary School, Newton Hall Infants’ School and Durham Blue Coat Junior School in County Durham also had to close.</p>
      <p>Dr Gayle Dolan, consultant in health protection for PHE North East, told Chronicle Live: ‘Around 60 schools across the region are reporting absences due to symptoms of likely viral illness including influenza (flu) and norovirus.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘We expect viral illnesses of this kind to circulate in schools and the community at this time of year and we have been providing advice to parents and schools to help reduce the spread of infection.’</p>
      <p>Norovirus is spread by coughing, sneezing and close contact, or touching the same surfaces.</p>
      <p>Regularly washing hands thoroughly using soap and water, especially before eating and after using the toilet, is the most efficient way to prevent it spreading.</p>
      <p>But PHE warned not to rely on alcohol gels, or hand sanitisers, as they do not kill the virus.</p>
      <p>Usually the virus will clear up in one to two days and sufferers are told to stay hydrated, however if a person is still suffering the symptoms after 72 hours they are advised to call NHS 111.</p>
      <p>Dr Dolan said: ‘If you are well continue activities as normal, but if you are unwell it is important to stay away from school or work until you are better.</p>
      <p>‘If you have diarrhoea or vomiting that is 48 hours after you have had symptoms and if you have flu it is until you are feeling better.’</p>
