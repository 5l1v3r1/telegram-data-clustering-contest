      <h1>Vehicles spinning out on Malahat due to icy conditions Friday morning</h1>

      <p>Icy conditions on the Malahat portion of the Trans-Canada Highway Friday morning left vehicles slipping and sliding.</p>
      <p>Shawnigan Lake RCMP said they received several calls about black ice and officers were stationed on the highway trying to slow down traffic and checking for winter tires.</p>
      <p>George Gibson of Malahat Gas at 231 Trans-Canada Hwy. said vehicles were spinning out on a particularly bad corner.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had four cars in a row here wipe out, spin around, and be able to keep going,” said Gibson.</p>
      <p>In another incident, two cars collided but were able to get to the side of the road and drive away, Gibson said.</p>
      <p>The province’s highway crews were contacted to salt the roads, he said. “We’re waiting for highways to show up and spray it or something.”</p>
      <p>The province requires motorists on the Malahat and other major highways at high elevations in B.C. to have winter tires — with a snowflake symbol for mountain and snow use or an M+S symbol for mud and snow.</p>
      <p>All tires must be in good condition with good treads. Large, heavy trucks must carry chains.</p>
