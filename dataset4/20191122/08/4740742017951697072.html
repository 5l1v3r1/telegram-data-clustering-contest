      <h1>The Green party manifesto: The eight key points</h1>
      <h2>The Green Party's 'If not now, when?' manifesto contains radical spending plans for the environment and welfare</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:59:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author">Alexandra Rogers</a></address>
      <p>The Green Party, which aims to win big in Bristol, launched its manifesto this week, putting climate change action at its heart ahead of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a>.</p>
      <p>But there are other pledges in there too on the NHS, education and welfare.</p>
      <p>Here are 10 key pledges in the manifesto, entitled: "If not now, when?"</p>

      <h3>1. Environment</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/green-party">Green Party</a> would spend £100bn every year for 10 years on tackling the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>This is the party's headline policy unveiled at its general election campaign launch in Bristol West earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The £100bn-a-year spending pledge over the next 10 years will be met by increasing corporation tax to 24 per cent. The party says it will also take advantage of low rates to borrow £91.2bn a year to fund the policy.</p>
      <p>Reducing the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels will come from building 100,000 energy-efficient homes each year, the party says, as well as investing in public transport, rolling out renewable energy to create thousands of jobs and planting 700 million trees by 2030.</p>
      <h3>2. Brexit</h3>
      <p>The Greens say they will give the public another say on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> through a second referendum, in which the party would campaign to remain in the EU.</p>
      <p>The party has also proposed a package of measures it believes will reform the EU, such as increasing the transparency of organisations such as the European Commission and allowing groups of EU citizens to propose reforms to its treaties.</p>
      <p>It also wants to see changes to the Commons Fisheries Policy and Common Agricultural Policy, so that it promotes more sustainable farming methods.</p>
      <h3>3. Health</h3>
      <p>The Green Party would inject at least £6bn per year into the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> until 2030, while it would put aside a further £1bn towards nursing higher education.</p>
      <p>It would also repeal the Health and Social Care Act of 2012, which it says will reduce private sector involvement in the NHS.</p>
      <p>An additional £4.5bn a year will be given to councils to allow them to provide free social care to people over 65.</p>

      <h3>4. Education</h3>
      <p>Undergraduate tuition fees, which are currently set at £9,000 per year, would be scrapped. Tuition for every higher education student would also be funded by the state.</p>
      <p>Existing student debt would be written off for former students who paid £9,000 a year.</p>
      <p>The party would abolish charitable status from private schools and charge full VAT on fees, while schools would get increased funding of at least £4 billion per year.</p>
      <p>Ofsted inspections and government-imposed testing would also go.</p>
      <h3>5. Welfare</h3>
      <p>Every adult citizen would receive a Universal Basic Income (UBI) , an unconditional financial  payment of £89 per week, which increases to £178 per week for pensioners.</p>
      <p>The Greens say the policy will free people from job insecurity and boost the income of those earning the minimum wage on 37.5 hours per week by about 10 to 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>It would replace most income-related payments in a way the party says would "simplify and streamline" the system.</p>
      <p>Disabled people will receive an additional supplement to their UBI, as will single parents and lone pensioners. There will also be additional supplements for certain families with children.</p>
      <p>Corporation tax would go up from 19 per cent to 24 per cent.</p>
      <h3>6. Housing</h3>

      <p>The Greens would give local authorities the power over empty homes and would also build 100,000 council houses a year, which they say would use 90 per cent less energy.</p>
      <p>Rent reform is also on the agenda, with the party pledging to introduce rent controls on private tenancies to reflect average local income rates and the cost of maintenance.</p>
      <h3>7. Electoral reform</h3>
      <p>Sixteen and 17-year-olds will be given the vote. The first-past-the-post system will be abolished in favour of proportional representation, and the House of Lords would become fully elected.</p>
      <h3>8. Immigration</h3>
      <p>The party has pledged to end Theresa May's hostile environment and to end indefinite detention and immigration detention centres. It would give refugees a right to work while their applications are assessed, and would impose no minimum income rules for visas, grant full workplace rights for migrants and the right to work for asylum seekers.</p>
