      <h1>‘Perfect’: Dimitar Berbatov backs Jose Mourinho’s appointment at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Spurs legend Dimitar Berbatov gives his verdict on Jose Mourinho's appointment at Tottenham</h2>

      <h3>Dimitar Berbatov says Jose Mourinho is the “perfect” appointment for Tottenham Hotspur.</h3>
      <p>Spurs confirmed Mourinho as their new manager on Wednesday morning less than 24 hours after Tottenham parted company with his popular predecessor Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian head coach paid the price for the north London side’s difficult start to the Premier League season after earning 14 points from 12 games.</p>
      <p>Pochettino led Tottenham to their first-ever Champions League final back in June before Spurs lost 2-0 to domestic rivals Liverpool FC in the Madrid showpiece.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has returned to Premier League management 11 months after Manchester United sacked the two-time Champions League winner.</p>
      <p>The former Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager has a point to prove in the English top flight after his disappointing spell at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Ex-Spurs striker Berbatov believes Mourinho is a great appointment for Tottenham given the north London side want to win trophies.</p>
      <p>“It came as a big surprise to me, I wasn’t expecting that, I don’t think anyone did,” Berbatov told <i>Betfair</i>.</p>
      <p>“They had their problems at Spurs but to do it now seems strange to me. For me he was the perfect guy for the club, but obviously after a while, a time comes when you need a change because you get used to things, you reach your potential and you plateau.</p>
      <p>“When that happens, you need to find a change and yes, they have probably reached that plateau as a team and it was not beneficial for both sides so they have parted ways, but I regret that they have taken this decision.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham finished in fourth position in the Premier League in their last four seasons under Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs are facing an uphill battle to break into the top four this season after a poor start to the Premier League campaign.</p>
      <p>The Lilywhites spent a club-record transfer fee on Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndombele in the summer.</p>
      <p>Spurs have never won the Premier League title and their best finish is third place.</p>
