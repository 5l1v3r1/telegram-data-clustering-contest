        <b>A man has been found guilty of murdering 22-year-old backpacker Grace Millane in New Zealand last year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Essex woman’s body was found buried in a suitcase near Auckland around a week after she was reported missing.</p>
      <p>She was strangled by a man she went on a date with after matching on the Tinder app.</p>
      <p>She spent several hours drinking with the man in central Auckland before returning to his apartment where she was murdered.</p>
      <p>It happened either the night before or in the early hours of December 2nd – her 22nd birthday.</p>

      <p>A jury this morning unanimously found a 27-year-old New Zealand man guilty of her murder. He will be sentenced in February.</p>
      <p>After Grace was reported missing, her father David Millane flew to New Zealand and took part in a week of searches before her body was found buried in a suitcase in the Waitakere Ranges, outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The killer - who was described as a "sociopath" during the trial - remained impassive before he was led away to the cells.</p>
      <p>He was then brought back to the dock, wearing a dark suit and black open-necked shirt, to be told by Judge Simon Moore that he would be sentenced next year.</p>
      <p>Grace's mother Gill broke into silent sobs as the verdict was read out.</p>
      <p>Mr Millane told reporters: “The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace.</p>
      <p>“It will not reduce the pain and the suffering we have had to endure over the past year.</p>
      <blockquote>“Grace was taken away from us in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</blockquote>
      <p>“This will be with us for the rest of our lives. Grace was a beautiful, talented, loving daughter.</p>
      <p>“Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever.</p>
      <p>“She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way during her gap year.”</p>

      <p>The trial heard Grace had been strangled during sex and the killer had taken a series of intimate photographs of her naked body before watching hardcore pornography through the early hours.</p>
      <p>Internet searches showed him actively plotting to conceal the murder – while CCTV showed him hiring a car, buying cleaning products, a shovel and a suitcase which he used to remove her body from his hotel room and bury in the woods.</p>
      <p>He also arranged another Tinder date for later that day.</p>
