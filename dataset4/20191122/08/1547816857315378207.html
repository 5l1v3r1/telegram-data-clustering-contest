      <p>Bollywood's favourite fashion designer Manish Malhotra’s father Suraj Prakash Malhotra passed away on Monday. He had been unwell for quite some time now and was in his early 90s. Among the first ones to reach Manish Malhotra’s residence to offer condolences, were Karan Johar, Sophie Choudry and Shabana Azmi. Other friends from the film fraternity and Bollywood celebrities such as Karan Johar, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Shweta Bachchan, Malaika Arora, Shilpa Shetty, Karisma Kapoor, and others also arrived at Manish Malhotra’s home to pay their last respects.</p>
      <p>Kareena Kapoor Khan had arrived with her sister Karisma Kapoor at Manish Malhotra’s residence and while Kareena was coming out of the house, at the same time Jaya Bachchan arrived. Bebo was snapped by the paparazzi as she greeted Jaya Bachchan with a smile and it looks like she made small talk before leaving. Now, Kareena has been trolled for smiling at the funeral and a section of people have called her out for it. While one comment on the picture reads, “She is smiling .... Which type of condolences is this ???? Someone kindly explain,” another comment read, “His father died, she is his so called dear friend and she laughing. At least keep a grim face for the cameras.” Another user wrote, “Kareena is always interested in photoshoots even at funerals.” <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/jaya-bachchan-scolds-media-for-clicking-pictures-at-manish-malhotra-s-residence-post-his-father-s-death/5dd4dcc587fb571eff7e422b">ALSO READ: Jaya Bachchan Scolds Media For Clicking Pictures At Manish Malhotra's Residence Post His Father's Death</a></p>
