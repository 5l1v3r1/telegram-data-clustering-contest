      <p>The iPhone 11 is practically perfect in every way. It has a 12MP dual-camera system with wide and ultra-wide lenses, Apple's fastest A13 Bionic chip, a Liquid Retina HD LCD display, and a 6.1" screen size.</p>
      <p>It uses Apple's advanced Face ID biometric scanning (which also means the True Depth FaceTime camera), supports Animoji, slo-mo selfies (or, "slofies" as Apple has marketed), 4K video recording support, Portrait mode for the front and back-facing cameras (including non-human subjects), Night mode, and a whole lot more.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 11 has nearly every single amazing feature the iPhone 11 Pro has except the three-camera system (which includes a telephoto lens) and the Super Retina OLED display. At a fraction of the price of the Pro model, this is why the iPhone 11 is the best iPhone for most people.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Dual-camera system</li>
        <li>Nearly all the same features as the iPhone 11 Pro</li>
        <li>Six different colors</li>
        <li>Really great price</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No telephoto lens</li>
        <li>LCD screen instead of OLED</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If your pocketbook has you restricted, the lowest-priced iPhone is the 4.7" iPhone 8. It sports Apple's A11 Bionic chip, a 12MP dual-camera system with wide and telephoto lenses, 4K video recording, and plenty of advanced technology. It's not Apple's latest and greatest, but it will continue to receive software support for years to come, and you can get it for a song (comparatively for an iPhone). This is the only phone with a Home button in Apple's current lineup. So if you prefer fingerprint scanning to facial scanning, this is the iPhone for you.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Least expensive iPhone</li>
        <li>Home button</li>
        <li>Telephoto lens</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2-year old processor chip</li>
        <li>Missing a lot of the new camera features of the iPhone 11</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The one thing that makes the iPhone 11 Pro noticeably different than the iPhone 11 is in the camera system. It's a 12MP triple-camera system with wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses. With three lenses, you can zoom in or out 2x and digitally zoom up to 10x. It's any photographer's dream and might even replace some people's daily camera carry. If you want the absolute most advanced camera system, this is the pick for you. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max also have the longest battery life of any iPhone ever by <i>a lot</i>.</p>
      <p>As a secondary note, if you prefer a slim iPhone design and don't mind spending the extra cash, the iPhone 11 Pro is also the thinnest of the entire lineup.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Triple-lens camera</li>
        <li>Super long battery life</li>
        <li>Super Retina OLED screen</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Most expensive iPhone</li>
        <li>No bright color options</li>

      <p>Let's face it; your kids are going to be secretly disappointed (or maybe openly disappointed) if you buy them an iPhone 8. It's a great phone at a great price, but they want the new hotness. The iPhone XR was Apple's best-selling iPhone in 2019 and was the most popular model until the iPhone 11 came along. It comes in six bright colors, supports Face ID and Animoji and Memoji, features Portrait mode (though only for humans), and is a great first iPhone for your kids.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Great price</li>
        <li>Bright colors</li>
        <li>Face ID</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Not an iPhone 11</li>

      <h3>Some advice for shopping for Black Friday iPhone deals</h3>
      <p>An iPhone is a personal thing; it's so personal that it knows more about you than your spouse or your parents. If you're upgrading from an iPhone SE, the iPhone 11 Pro is the closest in terms of size. It's thinner than any other model. If you want a big screen, an iPhone 8 Plus is a bargain option, but the iPhone 11 Pro Max, with its nearly edge-to-edge display, has the largest screen real estate of any iPhone.</p>
      <p>For Black Friday, you're not going to see a whole lot of big discounts on the iPhone 11 lineup, but there's a good chance that retailers and carriers that still have older models are going to offer special package discounts. You could get an iPhone 8 for even lower than the already low price it already sells for.</p>
      <p>We recommend keeping a close eye on carrier sales. If you have or want a Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint, or T-Mobile plan, you may find an incredible bargain on Black Friday through one of these carriers.</p>
      <p>Of course, the iMore deals team will be scouring the web during the entire Black Friday weekend (let's be honest, it's more like a week), looking for the best deals on iPhone devices, which we'll be sure to share with you. So keep this page bookmarked and check back often to find the best deals on all models of iPhone this Black Friday.</p>
