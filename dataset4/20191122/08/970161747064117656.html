      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> can never really escape the haters.</p>
      <p>Before series 11 had even begun, the choice of Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor – gasp! a woman playing an alien with two hearts! – had ruffled feathers, and although the majority of viewer and critic reaction to the series was positive, some people had issues with everything from the casting to the tone of the show.</p>
      <p>This was most evident after episode three, Rosa – a powerful episode in which the Doctor and her companions ended up in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955 and had to fight a mass murderer called Krasko to ensure that Rosa Parks (played by Vinette Robinson) still refused to give up her seat on the bus, thus influencing the civil rights movement in America.</p>
      <p>Rosa was overwhelmingly well received by critics and viewers and was praised for its historical detail. But of course, there were some negative reviews, with some viewers complaining that the show was being ‘preachy’.</p>

      <p>‘It’s one of the most current things going on today, so that’s just ignorant to say that, in a sense,’ Tosin Cole, who plays Ryan on the show, told Metro.co.uk at Doctor Who’s BBC set in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>‘Not to get angry about it, but… those issues are still going on now. That’s why it was so refreshing to see that, to see someone having a struggle years ago and to still see that struggle today, but in a new way. It hits home. I don’t think it was preachy in any way, it’s just reigniting that fire like “yo, these issues are still going on today, so let’s be aware of what’s going on”.</p>

      <p>‘I learned it in school – but maybe not in detail to that extent. If I didn’t do that show, I wouldn’t have known the precise dates of the movement, the ripple effects, those intricate details. It’s refreshing to show that to a younger audience and also to a family so then you can have that conversation in the household. I’m not saying do it every single episode, but it’s good to have those monumental episodes. It’s good to have those conversations and let kids know the past in order to make a better future.’</p>
      <p>And Bradley Walsh, who plays Graham, reckons that snobbery about sci-fi has stopped Doctor Who being commended for the episode at awards shows.</p>

      <p>‘Had that episode not had an alien in it, and the BBC would have spent the money making that into a one-off standalone drama, we’d have probably won a big award for that. Simple as that.’</p>
      <p>‘But it wouldn’t have had an alien in it,’ quipped Chibnall, before The Chase host continued his impassioned defence of the show.</p>
      <p>‘It was a standalone episode of titantic proportions – beautifully acted, beautifully scored, beautifully shot. And because it’s part of Doctor Who, people wanna go “you’re preaching to us”. That’s not the case. We’re also a drama, a very expensive, in the forefronts of everyone’s mind, drama. That’s why it sells globally, that’s why it’s such a gigantic show.’</p>

      <p>Broadchurch writer Chris, who joined Doctor Who in series 11 as showrunner, wrote Rosa along with Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman, with the episode featuring scoring from Segun Akinola and performances from Vinette Robinson and Joshua Bowman, and being supported by a team that ensured that Rosa’s costume was made from the original fabric that Parks actually wore. But even knowing the episode was in safe hands, Chibnall admits he was pretty nervy about tackling racism through such a monumental moment in history.</p>
      <p>‘Was I worried? Absolutely, I had sleepless nights, I worried about it from the moment I came up with the idea to the moment we started working on the story, through shooting it, through the edit… but we really wanted to tell that story,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘It was important. Part of the reason I took the job to do the show was to tell stories like that.’</p>
      <p>Jodie Whittaker – who is returning as the Thirteenth Doctor said: ‘And also Vinette. She absolutely smashed it and was incredible on set. You don’t necessarily see what the camera can see. You as an actor know she’s a really fantastic actress, but then when you appreciate the responsibility she had in that episode and the detail of the performance and the subtlety and the beauty of it… it was really moving to watch it as an audience member as well as being in it.</p>

      <p>‘When we saw her on set, any kind of anxiety for us went, because she was the perfect actor to portray this incredible woman in history.’</p>
      <p>However, Bradley wasn’t as rattled as his showrunner. ‘Personally I didn’t feel at all worried in the slightest. If you’re in the hands of an exceptional storyteller, it will work. I couldn’t wait to start working on that ep. If Chris is thinking that stuff up, you know it’s going to be fine. Chris’s behind the scenes work with all the research youv’e got to do, will be done – the due diligence will be done. The story will be told. The perception of the viewer will be subjective, but for me it was actually objective.</p>
      <p>‘The historical fact works, we’ll throw an alien in there to mix it up and so we can sell it as a global brand in Doctor Who. It was a perfect storm and a fantastic episode, and all the actors and actresses in it should be so proud of that particular episode – as with the Partition episode as well. If I never do anything else with my life, those two episodes for me were absolutely bang on.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>While there was criticism from some, any worries the team had about Rosa was dispelled by the reaction from fans.</p>
      <p>‘Our experience in the week after that episode going out is that we were deluged with calls and emails, from parents and kids, and I’ve never experienced a response to a piece of work like it,’ Chris said. ‘It’s really hard to overstress how phenomenally proud we are of that piece of work.’</p>
      <p>However, while the success of Rosa has given Chris confidence, it doesn’t mean series 12 will be full of historical Doctor Who episodes.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It gives you confidence to keep pushing. Maybe that’s the hallmark of what we’ve done this year is we come in in episode one with such a velocity of opening, going “we’re back and we’re having a blast”, and we’re trying to push Doctor Who as far as it can go really.</p>
      <p>‘There’s more historicals, but what you don’t want to do is repeat yourself. We’ll be approaching historicals in different ways. We’re always gonna be connected as a series and the type of Doctor Jodie brings and the importance of these characters starting in a contemporary world – we’re always gonna be connected to the real world and stuff that’s going on today. But we’re not always going to hit a historical straight down the line – there’s other things we can do.’</p>
