      <p>Over a year ago Elon Musk revealed that Tesla was working on an electric pick up truck.</p>
      <p>Details have been scarce, but the CEO revealed that it will be super futuristic and partially inspired by <i>Blade Runner</i>. In fact, his love of the film is also why November 21 (U.S. time) was chosen as the reveal date.</p>
      <p>Well, that day has come and this is how and when you can watch the new vehicle be unleashed on the world.</p>
      <p>Musk has stated in numerous interviews that he wants the truck, code named Cybertruck, to be more functional than a traditional Ford F-150, as well as far more futuristic.</p>
      <p>"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, <i>Blade Runner</i> pickup truck. It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">Recode</a>.</p>
      <p>He's also said that it could be bulletproof and look like an armoured personnel character reminiscent of those seen in sci-fi films.</p>
      <p>"You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care," he said in the same interview.</p>
      <p>While reiterating that he does in fact care as the company wants to get diesel trucks off the road, he said if the Cybertruck doesn't sell Tesla may just make a more conventional truck. For him, this vehicle is seemingly more of a passion project.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the time for speculation is almost over, as Musk will be revealing the electric truck in just a few hours.</p>
      <p>The event is due to kick off at 3pm AEDT, <b>2:30pm ACDT, 2pm AEST, 1:30pm ACST</b> and <b>11:00am AWST</b>.</p>
      <p>You can watch live on the <a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/">Tesla website,</a> and there will most likely be a reording uploaded to YouTube later, as per past broadcasts.</p>
