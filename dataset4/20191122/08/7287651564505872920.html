      <p>Valve has followed through on their promise, revealing the first details of Half-Life: Alyx, a new installment in the Half-Life series that will require a virtual reality headset. The game will be free to owners of Valve's Index and will also support Rift, Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality. Together with her father Eli Vance, the scientist Alyx begins her campaign against the extraterrestrial invaders and also leads the human resistance. The ingenuity of the father-daughter team helps to present a real danger to the majority of Combine forces.</p>
