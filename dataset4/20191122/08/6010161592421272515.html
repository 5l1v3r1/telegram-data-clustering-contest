      <h1>Resident Evil 3 remake is rumoured to be releasing in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:59:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>It looks like Capcom is working on a remake of Resident Evil 3.</p>
      <p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIXnB865l9Ex9zs4OIXTdQ">Spawn Wave</a> has published a video discussing a rumour they had heard about the next Resident Evil game. According to their findings, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is getting the Resident Evil 2 Remake treatment.</p>
      <p>Although the video doesn’t really tell us much about the game itself, such as whether or not Nemesis mechanics will be changed in any way to better fit a modern game, it does say that Capcom is planning to release it in 2020.</p>
      <p>Spawn Wave speculates that it could get revealed as early as this December at The Game Awards, but that all depends on how early/late in the year Capcom is targeting its release.</p>
      <p>The YouTuber has a fairly decent track record when it comes to leaks, more recently being the first <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/05/21/great-rune-from-software-collaboration-with-george-r-r-martin-rpg/">to leak FromSoftware’s Elden Ring</a>, and George R.R. Martin’s involvement.</p>

      <p>For its part, Capcom was always open to the idea of remaking Resident Evil 3, maintaining the old <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/04/resident-evil-3-remake-a-possibility-enough-fan-demand/">‘if fans want it’ line</a> when asked.</p>
      <p>A remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis on the RE Engine would make a lot of fans very happy, not to mention make a lot of sense.</p>
