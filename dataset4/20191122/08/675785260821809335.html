      <h1>Grace Millane suppression order: Why we can't name her sick killer for two years</h1>
      <h2>Grace Millane's killer was granted a suppression order banning media from publishing his name or photo and it won't be lifted any time soon after he was found guilty of murder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:04:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, Stephen D'Antal</a></address>
      <p>The identity of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/grace-millane">Grace Millane's</a> killer was kept a secret during his trial due to a suppression order that bans New Zealand media from naming and picturing him.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old man cannot be unmasked there even though a jury found him guilty of strangling the British backpacker in his Auckland hotel room and burying her body in a suitcase.</p>
      <p>The law doesn't extend to international media, including agencies in Britain, meaning they are free to name the man despite the strict and unusual reporting restrictions in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Even the reasons for the suppression order have been withheld. A judge will decide whether the order should be lifted when he is jailed in February 2020.</p>
      <p>If it isn't, it could remain in effect in New Zealand well into 2021.</p>
      <p>The order was put in place after British media were criticised in New Zealand for naming the man following his arrest just days after the murder in December last year. Google later broke the order in a mass email to subscribers.</p>

      <p>At the time, New Zealand's Justice Minister Andrew Little said: "The international media, particularly the British media are not helping the Millane family.</p>
      <p>"And if they are concerned about doing justice for the family, they should stop publishing details.</p>
      <p>"I would just say to the British media, we are dealing with a family from their country, it is their citizen who has been lost in New Zealand to this homicide here in New Zealand, we want to do justice for the family.</p>
      <p>"Justice means the person accused is held to account... Things that happen overseas that undermine this are an unhelpful action for the family."</p>
      <p>In the days after the murder, there were more than 100,000 Google searches of the man's name in New Zealand.</p>

      <p>The case has sparked a debate about suppression orders in the internet age.</p>
      <p>In New Zealand suspects and alleged victims can ask a court to have their name suppressed, making it illegal for it to be made public in that country.</p>
      <p>The aim is to protect defendants who are presumed innocent until proven guilty or the privacy of alleged victims, and to ensure a fairer trial.</p>
      <p>People found guilty of breaking the order could be jailed for up to six months. Companies can be fined up to NZD $100,000 (Â£50,000).</p>
      <p>In the Millane case, the suppression order will not be lifted any time soon even though the man has been convicted.</p>

      <p>It could remain in place until deep into 2021 at the earliest due to a number of legal issues which are also suppressed.</p>
      <p>While the law only applies to New Zealand media, it was respected by international agencies, including those in Britain, during the trial. International reporters risked being banned from the trial if they broke the order.</p>
      <p>The man was initially denied a suppression order, but his lawyer appealed - triggering a temporary order - and a High Court judge reserved his decision.</p>
      <p>That temporary order remains in force after the man was found guilty of murder following a two-week trial.</p>
      <p>Miss Millane, from Wickford, Essex, and the 27-year-old met on the dating app Tinder and spent several hours drinking together in the centre of Auckland before she was murdered.</p>
      <p>She was last seen in a lift with the killer at the CityLife hotel on the evening of December 1, 2018 - the night before her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>The backpacker, who was travelling around the world, was murdered in his room that night or in the early hours of her birthday.</p>
      <p>The defence had claimed the death was accidental and occurred during rough sex, but jurors rejected the defendant's version of the events.</p>
      <p>After killing Miss Millane, the man stuffed her body into a suitcase and buried her in the Waitakere Ranges, forested hills outside of Auckland.</p>
      <p>A jury of seven women and five men returned a unanimous verdict after just five hours deliberation at Auckland High Court.</p>

      <p>The man was first interviewed by police because he left a comment on one of Miss Millane's Facebook photos.</p>
      <p>He claimed they went their separate ways after their date, but later admitted she was dead and denied murdering her.</p>
      <p>He led police to the spot where he buried the British woman's body.</p>
      <p>The man had used his mobile phone to search for "flesh-eating birds" and "are there vultures in New Zealand?".</p>
      <p>He used Google to browse websites for large duffel bags, suitcases and car hire after Ms Millane died.</p>

      <p>He had also searched online for "the hottest fire", "large bags near me" and "Waitakere Ranges".</p>
      <p>After being found guilty, the killer was remanded to custody until his sentencing on February 21 next year.</p>
      <p>He faces life in prison with a minimum of 10 years without parole.</p>
      <p>Miss Millane's parents, David and Grace, and a number of jurors wept after the verdict was announced.</p>
      <p>Mr Millane had joined the search for his missing daughter before her body was found a week after the murder.</p>
      <p>He told reporters outside court: "It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year.</p>
      <p>"Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>"Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever."</p>
