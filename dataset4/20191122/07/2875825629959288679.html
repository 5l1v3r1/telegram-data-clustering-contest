      <h2>Shocked Stena Line crew members then found 16 men huddled together within the trailer at 9.20am before bringing them to safety</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:49:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:49</time> by <a rel="author">Trevor Quinn, Saoirse McGarrigle, Rebecca Black</a></address>
      <p>A total of 16 migrants cheated death after being locked in a refrigerated container on an Ireland-bound ferry for 12 hours.</p>
      <p>The men were yesterday found in a sealed Irish lorry on the ship, which set sail from France to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rosslare">Rosslare</a> in Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wexford">Wexford</a>.</p>
      <p>And sources said they may have had a hellish 30-day trek across Europe before reaching our shores.</p>
      <p>The alarm was raised by a staff member carrying out a routine inspection on the car deck when she heard banging noises from inside the refrigerated container.</p>
      <p>Shocked Stena Line crew members then found 16 men huddled together within the trailer at 9.20am before bringing them to safety.</p>
      <p>Staff alerted gardai 25 minutes later and took the men, from Iraq, Iran and Romania, to a private passenger lounge and offered them food, drinks and blankets.</p>

      <p>Officers were last night probing how they ended up on board.</p>
      <p>Councillor and paramedic Ger Carthy, who spoke to the migrants, said there was huge relief a major catastrophe was averted.</p>
      <p>He added: “This could have been a lot more tragic and that’s something we don’t want on our shores. We’re extremely lucky the crew member figured out they were in there after hearing noise at the side of the trailer.</p>
      <p>“I’d say the migrants are relieved they’ll end up getting asylum here.”</p>
      <p>The discovery comes just one month after 39 people were found dead inside a container with Irish connections in Essex, England.</p>
      <p>Gardai said immigration officers are processing the men and are trying to find out if one of them is a juvenile.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “After our initial inquiries they will transferred to a reception centre organised by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) where they will be provided for all their welfare concerns.</p>
      <p>“This has been a traumatic experience for these men and they are being treated with sympathy and compassion.</p>
      <p>“The articulated lorry was photographed and examined on the ferry and has now been removed to a secure location for further technical examination.</p>
      <p>“The articulated lorry (tractor and trailer) are owned by a local, Irish-based company. The owners are co-operating fully with the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>“The driver is a male in his 50s, resident of Ireland for over 25 years and he is co-operating fully with the ongoing investigation.”</p>
      <p>Fianna Fail’s justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan said traffickers have to be thoroughly policed so vulnerable people are protected.</p>
      <p>He added: “A full investigation must be launched into the discovery of 16 people being transported in the back of a lorry to Ireland.</p>
      <p>“Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery and needs to be tackled with fully resourced policing.</p>

      <p>“Recent events show, unfortunately, Ireland is playing a significant part in this crime.”</p>
      <p>It is understood all of the men who spoke to immigration officers yesterday are claiming asylum here and their cases will be dealt with over the coming days.</p>
      <p>The vessel sailed from Cherbourg and docked in Rosslare Europort just after 2.30pm yesterday.</p>
      <p>Gardai and medics quickly went on board to treat the migrants.</p>
      <p>The men, who are understood to be between 18 and 35, were all in good health and were spoken to by officers who carried out assessments and searches.</p>
      <p>It is believed several migrants were travelling from war-torn countries.</p>
      <p>Mr Carthy said: “Some of them had broken English but I think they were probably looking for asylum in the United Kingdom. I’d say they didn’t expect to be on that ship. I’d say they got on the wrong one.”</p>
      <p>He added the Essex case showed how yesterday’s incident could easily have resulted in tragedy.</p>
      <p>Mr Carthy said: “They were in quite good spirits. They had travelled a number of days across France and ended up in Cherbourg.</p>
      <p>“They said they travelled for 30 days.They had been travelling from around Iraq or somewhere but they weren’t in the trailer that long because some of them were clean-shaven.”</p>

      <p>He told how there was a lot of uncertainty over how the men ended up in the container, adding: “Someone may have facilitated their travel.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if they were being trafficked or were being locked in.”</p>
      <p>Mr Carthy said Irish authorities need to find out what checks were carried out before the trailer left Cherbourg and called for “appropriate facilities at Rosslare Europort”.</p>
      <p>The migrants were assessed for more than three hours by the National Ambulance Service and staff from Wexford General Hospital.</p>
      <p>A decision on where the men would be taken was being finalised last night but it was expected they would be brought to Dublin.</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the State’s initial response to the incident will be a humanitarian one “to make sure those people are well and their health is good”.</p>
      <p>He added: “After that of course there will be need to be a response that involves the police, the gardai, because as you know human trafficking is illegal.</p>
      <p>“And then we’ll need to see what happens with the people who come ashore.</p>
      <p>"They may wish to seek asylum, which they’re entitled to do, or they may wish to be returned to the safe country from which they came.</p>
      <p>“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”</p>

      <p>Foot passenger Mariane Mello, a Brazilian national who was travelling to Ireland to visit her boyfriend in Co Wicklow, told how passengers were informed “there was going to be a delay because they had found some unauthorised people on the boat”.</p>
      <p>Stena Line’s chief people and communications officer Ian Hampton said the ferry firm had alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so the necessary arrangements could be “made for the group on the vessel’s arrival”.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan added: “I was extremely concerned to learn of another incident of people being found in a sealed lorry container, on this occasion on board a ferry.</p>
      <p>“There is an active Garda investigation under way and I would appeal to anyone with any information on these nefarious activities to come forward.</p>
      <p>“The persons found in the lorry container are now being cared for by State services. As part of that care, they will receive initial medical assessments.”</p>
