      <h1>German 3Q adjusted GDP up 0.1%, unchanged from initial estimate</h1>

      <p>Germany’s economy grew in the third quarter on the back of consumption, Germany’s Federal Statistical Office said Friday, confirming a preliminary estimate.</p>
      <p>The quarter-on-quarter comparison shows that positive contributions in the quarter mainly came from household and government consumption, Destatis said. Household final consumption edged 0.4% higher on the quarter and government consumption rose 0.8%.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, gross domestic product--the broadest measure of goods and services produced in an economy--increased an adjusted 0.1% from the previous quarter. GDP grew 0.5% on year in the third quarter on a calendar and price-adjusted basis, Destatis said, confirming the first estimate. In a year-on-year comparison, it was also consumption that supported the economy.</p>
      <p>Before last week’s preliminary estimate, a number of economists had expected Germany’s economy to slip into a technical recession. Recent indicators sent mixed signals on growth, with improvements in manufacturing orders but weak data on industrial production.</p>
      <p>Foreign trade was another driver of economic growth. Destatis on Friday said exports rose 1.0% in the quarter, while imports grew 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Gross fixed capital formation went up 1.2% in the construction sector in comparison with the previous quarter, while decreasing in machinery and equipment 2.6%.</p>
      <p>German GDP declined 0.2% in the second quarter, after having grown 0.5% in the first quarter.</p>
