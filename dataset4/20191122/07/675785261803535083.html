      <h1>Boxing fans told they cannot sue over 'boring' Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao fight</h1>
      <h2>Mayweather beat Pacquiao in 2015 before it emerged the Filipino was carrying a shoulder injury into the fight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:52:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled boxing fans who felt cheated after learning that Manny Pacquiao had been injured before fighting Floyd Mayweather cannot pursue class-action litigation</p>
      <p>Fans had claimed the fight - which Mayweather won comfortably by unanimous decision - was a let down after years of build-up.</p>
      <p>But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that those who paid hundreds of millions of dollars to watch a "yawner" of a fight "got what they paid for".</p>
      <p>Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said the plaintiffs suffered no legal injury from Pacquiao's failure to reveal a four-week-old injury to his right shoulder until three hours before fight started on May 2, 2015.</p>
      <p>She said letting the case proceed could fundamentally alter professional sports by requiring athletes to disclose minor injuries, which opponents could use to their advantage, or risk a slew of lawsuits.</p>

      <p>Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.</p>
      <p>Former super-middleweight world champion George Groves provides expert analysis.</p>

      <p>"Although the match may have lacked the drama worthy of the pre-fight hype, Pacquiao's shoulder condition did not prevent him from going the full 12 rounds," Nguyen wrote.</p>
      <p>"Plaintiffs therefore essentially got what they paid for - a full-length regulation fight between these two boxing legends."</p>
      <p>Nguyen also noted a New York state appeals court had dismissed fraud claims when Mike Tyson was disqualified for biting off part of Evander Holyfield's ear in a 1997 heavyweight bout, because fans had paid to see "whatever event transpired."</p>
      <p>Mayweather-Pacquiao tickets started at $1,500 and fetched up to $231,000 on the secondary market. Commercial subscribers paid up to $10,000 for pay-per-view access.</p>

      <p>Defendants included Mayweather and Pacquiao, AT&amp;T Inc's HBO unit, which co-produced the fight, and promoters Top Rank and Bob Arum.</p>
      <p>"We are very pleased," Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Top Rank and Arum, said. "The court established the very important principle that while sports fans may be zealous and passionate they do not have the right to sue because they are disappointed in how a contest was conducted, or in the outcome."</p>
      <p>Mayweather's lawyer Mark Tratos said the decision shows that ticketholders get "no guarantee" they will like what they watch.</p>
      <p>The decision comes as Mayweather announced plans to come out of retirement next year having not fought since he beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>That could lead to a rematch with Pacquiao who remains a welterweight world champion.</p>
