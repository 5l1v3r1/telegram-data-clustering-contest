      <p>Former Everton striker Kevin Campbell believes Marco Silva needs to pull Moise Kean for a heart-to-heart to help get him firing at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>The Italian teenager is under a bit of pressure at the moment having failed to score for the club in 11 appearances.</p>
      <p>Kean joined the club in a £27.5 million move from Juventus (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49214067">BBC Sport</a>) in the summer and arrived on Merseyside with a big reputation.</p>

      <p>But so far he’s found the going tough, and the manager clearly doesn’t have full trust in him just yet, with Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin getting more game time.</p>
      <p>In the eyes of Campbell, struggling Kean could do with an arm around the shoulder to take some of the pressure off.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kevin-campbell-urges-everton-use-17292283">He told the Liverpool Echo</a>: “Maybe it’s time for a heart-to-heart between Kean and the manager.</p>

      <p>“At the end of the day it’s down to the manager, and I think the support might be wearing a bit thin with Marco Silva as opposed to Moise Kean.</p>
      <p>“If you’re not going to be playing the person you spent that sort of money on, then you’ve got to be winning games haven’t you?”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Kean needs trust</h3>
      <p>It is important for Silva to ensure Kean knows he trusts him by persisting with him in his correct position.</p>

      <p>Silva has not made life easy for him so far – starting him on the right-wing against Watfordrecently and taking him off at half-time must have been a tough evening for him.</p>
      <p>He is a fantastic prospect and needs the love from his manager.</p>
      <p>He’ll get that and plenty of patience from the fans, but Silva has to show he believes in the starlet.</p>
