Of this, close to one lakh vehicles were sold during the month of October owing to the festive demand.

      <p>"Initially, there was some confusion in the minds of the consumers regarding the transition from BS4 to BS6. To provide clarity, we rolled out several awareness initiatives to communicate the advantages of adopting BS6 technology. These have helped us build confidence reflecting in the overall response to our BS6 range, which is very encouraging. We have observed that customers across cities have become more environment conscious and are willing to upgrade to vehicles with better technology which are environment friendly.", Shashank Srivastava added.</p>
