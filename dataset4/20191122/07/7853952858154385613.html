      <p>China wants to work out an initial trade pact with the United States and has been trying to avoid a trade war, but is not afraid to retaliate when necessary, President Xi Jinping said on Friday.</p>
      <p>“We want to work for a ‘Phase One’ agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality,” Xi told representatives of an international forum, according to Reuters. </p>
      <p>“When necessary we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war. We did not initiate this trade war and this is not something we want, the news agency said, citing a pool report.</p>
      <p>Xi was responding to questions from representatives of the New Economy Forum organized by Bloomberg at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.</p>
      <p>In Beijing on Wednesday, Vice Premier Liu He, China’s chief negotiator in the trade talks, said he was cautiously optimistic on a phase one deal, Bloomberg News said, citing people who attended a dinner event ahead of the forum.</p>
      <p>“The two countries should really ink the deal the sooner the better, at least a truce, and that will inject some certainty into the market and the economy,” Hu was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>“Based on this, we can clear out a consensus on complicated structural problems, and strive for a comprehensive final agreement.”</p>
      <p>China has invited top US trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing unidentified sources.</p>
      <p>Beijing hopes the talks could take place before next Thursday’s US Thanksgiving holiday, according to the report.</p>
