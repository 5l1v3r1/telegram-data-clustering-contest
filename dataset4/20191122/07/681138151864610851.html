        <b>Members of the University and College Union at 60 UK universities, including the University of East Anglia and University of Essex, will stage eight days of strike action from Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the ballot of UCU members at the University of East Anglia, 76% of those who voted backed strikes over pension changes.</p>
      <p>Strike action was called after no agreement could be reached between university representatives and the union.</p>
      <p>Staff will be on picket lines at the university's main entrance from 8am each day.</p>
      <p>The dispute concerns changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).</p>
      <p>As well as eight strike days, union members will begin "action short of a strike" from Monday - working strictly to contract, not covering absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures lost to strike action.</p>
      <p>UCU East Anglia rep Ben Jones said: "Strike action is a last resort, but universities' refusal to deal with absolutely key issues have left us with no alternative."</p>
      <p>Strike action at the University of Essex concerns the USS pensions dispute and the pay and conditions dispute.</p>
