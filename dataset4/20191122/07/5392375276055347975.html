      <p>Google is preparing a new mode for Digital Wellbeing<br/>4 (80%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>With Digital Wellbeing, Google has started the development of tools that provide a valid measure of how much and how we use our smartphone. The Google app is in continuous development and could soon receive a new mode.</p>
      <p>The novelty as reports XDA would come with the name Minimal Phone. As you can see from the example shown in the image below. It is a modality that would be available in the Wind Down category. And that would be activated in the same way as the grayscale for the display and the Do Not Disturb mode. The new mode would have the purpose of making the apps set for the night. By reducing eye strain from blue light.</p>

      <h3>Digital Wellbeing preps a “Minimal Phone” mode to help you Wind Down at night</h3>
      <p>The new mode is currently under development. And is not even available to those who have joined the beta testing program. To preview the future news, we suggest registering for the program via <i><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.wellbeing">this address</a></i>.</p>
      <p>It is worth to mention that during the last developer conference of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Google">Google</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/07/18/android-q-digital-wellbeing-integrates-the-family-link-app/">announced greater integration between the Digital Wellbeing and Family Link</a>. With Android 10, the Mountain View giant has integrated parental control directly into the settings section dedicated to Digital Wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Family Link is the application that allows parents to set limits for their children to use smartphones. With Android 10, the users will have both services available on a single screen simply. By accessing the Digital Wellbeing section starting from the Settings.</p>
