      <p>Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been sworn in as the Prime Minister. The architects of the 19th Amendment (19A), who sought to keep the Rajapaksas at bay, must be really disappointed. They reintroduced the presidential term limit to prevent Mahinda from running for President again and imposed a minimum age limit on presidential candidates while banning dual citizens from contesting elections, to place members of the Rajapaksa family at a disadvantage. They have come up empty.</p>
      <p>We have just witnessed a rare turn of events replete with irony, where the post of Prime Minister is concerned.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne, who was made to ‘disappear’ in the wake of the 2015 regime change, passed away, the other day; he, however, had seen Ranil Wickremesinghe, who grabbed his post, suffer a similar fate, under the same circumstances. Karmic forces at work, one may say. Maithripala Sirisena, who left the UPFA in a huff as he could not achieve his prime ministerial dream and became the President, has retired after serving his first term. Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose bid to secure the premiership, in 2015, was foiled by President Sirisena, who, however, appointed him to that post subsequently, has become the PM again. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who fought back after being defenestrated last year and regained premiership, had to resign yesterday, even though there was no constitutional requirement to do so.</p>
      <p>President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has received bouquets for what he has done so far. His executive order banning the display of politicians’ pictures in state institutions, keeping the Galle Road open near the Presidential Secretariat during a ceremony to mark his assumption of duties, the reduction of the presidential staff and limiting the number of caretaker Cabinet ministers to 15 have gone down well with the public. These are signs that the new President is trying to make a difference in politics and live up to the people’s expectations. He looks determined to do so, but, politics and the state sector have got so dirty over the years that he will have to prove that he is equal to Hercules’ fifth labour. One can only hope that the people are not witnessing yet another false dawn.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, problems are likely to crop up when the caretaker government becomes functional. All the undesirables responsible for the downfall of the Rajapaksa government, in 2015, have crawled out of the woodwork, nay, they are painting the town red. They must be salivating at the prospect of savouring power and lining their pockets again at the expense of the public. They are sure to revert to their old habits before long. Most of them should have been thrown behind bars years ago. Their inefficiency and corruption ruined the state institutions they headed and made their political masters highly unpopular. They are lucky that the yahapalana politicians started to make up for lost time, in 2015, instead of going all out to bring them to justice, committed the bond scams and found themselves behind the eight ball, as a result.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge the SLPP is faced with is saving itself from the corrupt elements within its ranks. If given free rein, they will ruin the party and the government soon. It is their counterparts in the UNP who ruined the yahapalana government’s chances of winning elections. The UNP is in total disarray at present and there are no signs of its recovery in the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>The newly elected President’s success in accomplishing his mission hinges on his ability to rid the SLPP and the government of the corrupt elements. It is, however, a tall order in that he is sure to come under pressure from various quarters to spare them.</p>
