        <b>SCOTT BROWN has refused to rule out a sensational Scotland return at the Euros.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> skipper quit the international scene for a second time in February 2018.</p>

      <p>But Brown, 34, has left the door open to pulling on the national shirt again if Steve Clarke’s side make it through March’s play-offs.</p>
      <p>Asked if Clarke was to sound him out, Brown said: “They still have two games to get through but you never say never.</p>
      <p>“It would be phenomenal to get to a finals after 22 years. Football’s a funny game and you never know.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a good place fitness-wise in terms of my body and I make sure I keep myself ticking over.</p>

      <p>“But it’s been hard for me to watch the Scotland games because you always want to be playing in them. I need to look after No 1 though.</p>
      <p>“My wish is I could still be playing for Celtic and Scotland at the age of 45.</p>
      <p>“But there comes a time when you have to make sure your body’s okay and give yourself the best chance of continuing to play for your club.”</p>
      <p>Scotland find out if they’ll face Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary or Israel in the first game at Hampden on March 26 when the draw takes place at 11am this morning.</p>
      <p>Brown originally quit playing for the country in August 2016 to focus on staying in peak condition for Celtic.</p>
      <p>Gordon Strachan then persuaded him to reverse that decision two months later and he faced England twice in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.</p>
      <p>But he hung up his boots again at the start of last year with 55 caps.</p>
      <p>Brown said: “It’s a regret of mine we never managed to get to a finals. We came close against Norway in 2009 but we didn’t get there.</p>
      <p>“If big Chris Iwelumo had just stuck that chance away, it would’ve made me a happy man but it wasn’t to be.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had other chances but didn’t get there. I remember watching the games at France 98.</p>
      <p>“I was 13 and my mum had put Scotland flags all around the windows and outside in the street. I don’t know what she was playing at!</p>
      <p>“It was great and it shows you the whole country wants us to get back there again.”</p>
      <p>It looks unlikely the SPFL will be able to aid Clarke with the fixtures before the play-off — but Brown isn’t giving up hope.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m sure the SPFL and clubs will help him as much as they can.</p>
      <p>“It’s a huge occasion and we must make sure we give Scotland as much hep as we can.</p>
      <p>“We need to put the clubs on the backburner for four or five days to make sure we give Steve the best options possible.”</p>
      <p>Brown returns to work with the Hoops tomorrow when they host Livingston in the Premiership.</p>
      <p>He added: “The international breaks have been incredible — they’ve allowed me to go away and relax, play golf and recharge my batteries. That’s been good for me.”</p>
