        <b>STEVE BRUCE revealed how a round of GOLF helped him steal John McGinn from Celtic.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ex-Aston Villa boss has hailed the Scot, as his best signing after snatching him from <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibs</a> for £3million 15 months ago.</p>

      <p>And Bruce admitted he had to pull out all the stops to gazump <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> — including treating McGinn’s golf-mad dad to a round at The Belfry.</p>
      <p>The Newcastle boss, whose side tackle Villa on Monday night, said: “Given their financial plight at the time, Villa didn’t have £3m.</p>
      <p>“How we got him out of a move to Celtic I don’t really know because his grandfather Jack was Celtic’s former chairman.</p>
      <p>“We stuck at it because we knew how good John was and it took a couple of rounds of golf at The Belfry with his dad until we could muster the money together. I didn’t mind paying for those.”</p>
      <p>Scotland ace McGinn has now been linked with a £50m move to Manchester United and Bruce added: “John’s at the level of a big club like Manchester United. I’m delighted for him because he is a smashing lad.</p>
      <p>“Given what he’s done in the past 12 months I can only see him continuing to improve.</p>
      <p>“He has to be one of my best ever signings because he has a determination to do well. With him and Jack Grealish in the middle, they’ll be a handful because they are two top players.”</p>
