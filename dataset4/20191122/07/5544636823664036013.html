      <p>Ex-Governor of Niger Babangida Aliyu has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel Saturday’s governorship elections in <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/22/what-babangida-told-inec-about-bayelsa-kogi-elections/">Kogi</a> and <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/18/buhari-receives-bayelsa-governor-elect-lyon-in-aso-rock/">Bayelsa states.</a></p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the All Progressives Congress (APC) claimed the two governorship seats, according to the results announced by INEC.</p>
      <p>Babangida who is of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has, in a statement on Thursday, however, condemned the violence that marred the polls, calling for a cancellation.</p>
      <p>According to Aliyu: “we hereby ask INEC and the government in power to annul the elections in the interest of peace, the growth of democracy and fairness.</p>
      <p>“(This is) for the soul of Salomi Acheju Abuh and of all those who were slain in Kogi and Bayelsa states in the course of last Saturday’s elections by the agents of the states.</p>
      <p>“We ask the federal government to not only condemn the wanton killings and destruction of properties but to empanelled well-balanced committees to probe the dastardly acts and speedily bring those behind the arsons and fish out their sponsors for proper justice.”</p>
      <p>Also, he said: “As civilized citizens, we note with serious concern that the general conducts of the governorship elections in the two states, where innocent citizens were subjected to crude, brutal and naked use of force have rubbished the essence of the elections.</p>
      <p>“Therefore we reject the outcomes of the two elections in their entirety.</p>
      <p>“The conducts and outcomes of the elections in the two states are therefore not the reflections of free choice by the electorate in the two states nor are they in tandem with democratic traditions hence we reject the results posted by INEC in all their ramifications.</p>
      <p>“It is pertinent to say here that subversion of the free will and wishes of citizens at elections and at any public fora amounts to, not only illegality but gross abuse of the fundamental principles of the rights of citizens to elect candidates of their preferred choice to govern them.”</p>
      <p>But the Chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Niger State  Mohammed Imam, faulted Babangida, describing his statement as merely attention-seeking.</p>
      <p>“He is actually canvassing for such, knowing fully well that INEC cannot annul election after it had declared it,” he told NAN.</p>
