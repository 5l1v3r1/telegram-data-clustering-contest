      <p>A shocking video shows a Philippine Airlines flight ‘spewing fire’ shortly after taking off from Los Angeles International Airport.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said the Boeing 777-300ER appeared to ‘burst into flames’ as it set off for Manila with 365 people on-board.</p>
      <p>Pilots of the flight declared an emergency and reported a possible engine failure, before heading back to the airport.</p>
      <p>They made an emergency landing around 8pm local time, and were immediately met by the Los Angeles Fire Department, a spokesperson for the airport said.</p>

      <p>Andrew Ames, 36, saw the plane ascend over the ocean with ‘little flames shooting out from the engine’.</p>
      <p>The fitness expert, from Los Angeles, continued: ‘It almost looked like backfire flames from a motorcycle or car.</p>
      <p>‘I had never seen a plane spew flames repeatedly. Then it stopped. As soon as it stopped, I saw the plane bank left, like it was heading back to airport.’</p>
      <p>One woman, who filmed the flames from inside the plane, described how she had started praying shortly before the plane turned around.</p>
      <p>GE Aviation, which makes the GE90 engine for the 777 jetliner, said they are working with Philippine Airlines to ‘determine the cause of the event and to promptly return the aircraft to service’.</p>
