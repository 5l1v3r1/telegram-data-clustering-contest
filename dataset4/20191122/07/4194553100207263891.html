      <h1>Salah &amp; Robertson situation explained as both train at Melwood with team-mates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool fans online were delighted yesterday evening after pictures showed Mo Salah and Andy Robertson training at Melwood with the first-team ahead of Saturday’s Crystal Palace tie.</p>
      <p>This would usually suggest both would be fit to play two days’ later, but Mirror journalist Dave Maddock has explained that neither actually stayed on for the contact part of the session – and a decision would be made today if they’ll join.</p>
      <blockquote>Salah and Robertson DIDN’T take part in full <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LFC</a> training this afternoon, just the first pre-contact section. Both did separate tailored programme later. Klopp will see if they can return to full training tomorrow before making decision on presence in starting XI at weekend.<br/>— David Maddock (@MaddockMirror) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddockMirror/status/1197577249660293121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>So, if either our superstar left-back or right-winger does the full contact session today, they should be ready for Selhurst Park – but if they don’t – they won’t.</p>
      <p>Ideally, we’d rest both and actually give them midweek against Napoli off as well – but every game at the moment feels like it’s must-win.</p>
      <p>We’re eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table, but that lead will evaporate unless we keep our foot on the pedal.</p>
      <p>Winning the Champions League game would enable us to play the kids v Rb Salzburg and give everyone a midweek rest in December, which would be mighty handy.</p>
