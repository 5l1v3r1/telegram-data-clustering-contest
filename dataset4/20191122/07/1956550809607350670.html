      <p>Last month we brought you the news that popular Dubai nightlife venue <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/420459-iris-dubai-to-open-at-meydan-racecourse">Iris was moving to Meydan</a>. Iris is now open – and it’s bringing a whole bunch of deals to check out.<br/><br/>The cool Lebanese nightspot was formerly housed at The Oberoi Dubai in Business Bay, but shut recently to relocate, and we’re sure this new open-air spot will be popular with partygoers in the city.<br/><br/>And the new al fresco bar has new deals, including a Friday <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/brunch">brunch</a> from 1pm until 5pm every week, where you’ll get creative drinks, skyline views and live cooking stations, from Dhs250. Meanwhile on a Sunday you can get a tasting menu of signature dishes and a glass of bubbly for Dhs350 a person.<br/><br/>Iris is run by the same team behind Dubai super-clubs WHITE and Drai’s, and this new venue has a similar look to the Beiruti original – but with super views across to Downtown Dubai and Burj Khalifa.<br/><br/>Dishes on the menu are influenced by Mediterranean, Japanese and South American cuisines and include sushi, tacos, flatbreads, burgers and more.<br/><br/>There’s also an innovative mixed drinks menu, as fans of the bar will be familiar with, and there’s a <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/happy-hours/386863-dubai-happy-hours-2018-best-bar-deals-offers-and-discounts">happy hour</a> from 5pm until 8pm every day, with live beats from DJ Nua Akuna. Live bands plays every Monday and Saturday from 9pm, while Tuesdays see guest DJs take to the decks, and on Wednesday there’s live percussion and singing.<br/><br/>“Iris has rebranded as part of its international expansion and franchise,” said Wassim Zouein, Iris Managing Director. “The brand has grown exponentially over the past couple of years on an international scale and is still growing, with Iris Café launching in Saudi Arabia. The new Meydan location represents incredibly exciting times for the brand.”<br/><br/>Iris joins top names already at Meydan including <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/music-nightlife-awards-2019/400129-simply-the-best-nights-out-in-town"><i>Time Out Dubai</i>’s Club of the Year 2019</a>, Drai’s Dubai, as well as <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars/toy-room-dubai">Toy Room Duba</a>i, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars/soho-garden">Soho Garden</a>, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/details/398440-soho-beach">Soho Beach</a> and longstanding nightclub <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/415274-white-dubai-is-back-for-the-2019-winter-season">WHITE Dubai</a>.<br/><br/>That’s your sunset plans sorted.<br/><i>Open Sat-Wed 5pm-2am, Thu 5pm-3am, Fri 1pm-3am.
