      <h1>Does 'Frozen II' Have a Post-Credits Scene?</h1>
      <h2>Will your kids need to stick around to see more Anna, Elsa and Olaf after the credits roll?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:09:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:09</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Welk, Phil Owen</a></address>
      <p>It’s been six years since the release of “Frozen,” an original, animated Disney movie so big that it became a pop cultural sensation. If you don’t count the “live-action” remake of “The Lion King” from this year, “Frozen” is the highest grossing animated movie of all time, snowballing to $1.27 billion at the global box office. And now with “Frozen II” hitting theaters, finally your kids will be bugging you to watch a different movie on repeat.</p>
      <p>Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven are all back in “Frozen II” for a new adventure, but the new film has a lot to live up to. The original “Frozen” was groundbreaking for how it reinvented the Disney princess template for the 21st Century, giving its two heroines a sense of real agency and establishing a strong relationship between two women that’s rarely seen on screen. And of course, the track “Let It Go” was so huge it became an instant Disney classic. Idina Menzel’s performance of the sweeping, Broadway-esque ballad even won the Oscar for Best Original Song.</p>
      <p>Whether “Frozen II” can match the original with its songs, animation or humor, anticipation for a new film is no doubt high, and the film should be a box office smash with young audiences all the same, as it’s already tracking for an opening above $100 million. The question is whether your children will patiently be up for just a little bit more “Frozen” after the credits start to roll. So, should you stick around?</p>

      <p><b>Yes, “Frozen II” does have a brief post-credits scene at the end of the film.</b> During the credits however, you’ll hear three alternate takes on some of the film’s original songs. First, the actor who plays Kristoff, Jonathan Groff, sings one of Elsa’s big numbers, “Into the Unknown.” Next, Kacey Musgraves sings an acoustic version of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1amXdBJQJY&amp;feature=youtu.be">All Is Found</a>,” which is initially heard at the very start of the film as performed by Evan Rachel Wood as a lullaby to the young Anna and Elsa. Finally, Weezer give their take on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqzFqVAhhXQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Lost in the Woods</a>,” the big, comedic rock ballad that Kristoff sings midway through the movie.</p>
      <p>But on to that post-credits scene! And keep in mind, there are <b>SPOILERS</b> here for “Frozen II” if you have yet to see the film. Olaf (Josh Gad) has a great gag during the movie where he rattles off a quick recap of how they got here. He pantomimes and acts out all the most famous moments from the first “Frozen,” all building up to the explanation of why Anna and Elsa are now exploring a hidden, enchanted forest outside of Arendelle.</p>
      <p>During the post-credits scene however, he recaps the remaining events of the movie you just watched. He says he was right all along about his theory that “water has memory,” a recurring theme of the film, and he assures the audience that yes, he’s still alive. It’s a tragically sad moment when Olaf briefly melts away in one scene after Elsa becomes trapped in ice, but she uses her magic to revive him for a happy ending. “I live, and so do you,” Olaf says to the camera. The camera then cuts to a captive audience of the massive snow monster from the first film and hundreds of other baby snowmen all listening intently to Olaf’s story.</p>

      <p>“Frozen II” is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, and Kirsten Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad all returned to the voice cast. The film’s newcomers are Evan Rachel Wood, Sterling K. Brown, Jason Segel, Martha Plimpton, Ciarán Hinds, Rachel Matthews and Alfred Molina. Critics have been somewhat more muted on the new “Frozen,” as the film has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771415108">a 77 percent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes</a>, compared to the original’s 90 percent.</p>
