      <p>As the opposition National Democratic Congress(NDC) accuses the governing New Patriotic Party(NPP) government’s cabinet of being filled with family and friends, the Chairman of Cape Coast North constituency of the NPP  Mr. Stephen Kojo Arhin has observed that Nana Akufo-Addo’s family and friends are competent unlike Mahama’s.</p>
      <p>Mr. Arhin, who is known in politics as Wewebi, in an exclusive interview with <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> said Nana Addo’s relatives and friends supported him spiritually and financially before he won the seat and therefore sees nothing wrong if they are appointed into enviable positions</p>
      <p>According to him, Nana Akufo Addo’s bid to appoint relatives and friends in his government is to appreciate those who stood by him during his turbulent times.</p>
      <p>The NPP executive stated that the said relatives and friends are working marvelously and supporting Nana Addo to deliver adding “I swear if Ghanaians did not vote for Nana Akufo-Addo, Ghana would have been like hell”.</p>
      <p>He counseled the NDC to forget power as well as to stop throwing dust into eyes of  innocent Ghanaians since their so-called 50 member list of the current administration within NPP government is meaningless.</p>
      <p>Touching on the hardship in the country, he said the hardship existed before his boss Nana Addo came into power and he (Akufo-Addo) needs time to fix the economy that was strangulated by the previous administration</p>
      <p>According to him, everyone including some elements in the opposition can testify  Nana Addo’s marvelous achievements within three years than the previous government that was borne out of create, loot and share</p>
