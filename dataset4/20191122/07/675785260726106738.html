      <p>A terrified cat owner begged her pet to 'back up' after making a surprise discovery under a boot.</p>
      <p>Insurance analyst Christina Laughter, 38, from Florida, US, originally thought her mog was playing with a shadow.</p>
      <p>She filmed herself saying: "I can't even make this up, for 30 minutes at least, the cat's been over here getting sketched out by a shadow."</p>
      <p>The woman adds 'what is it, Barley?' as her cat stares at the boot, before adding 'now he's checking out the boot's shadow'.</p>

      <p>The woman then lets out a blood-curdling scream as she spots a snake under the boot.</p>
      <p>She shouts 'it's a f****ing snake' and urges her cat 'back up Barley, back up Barley'.</p>
      <p>The clip ends with Christina running from the snake, however, her cat continues to sit nearby and watch the uninvited guest.</p>
      <p>The snake looks less than half a metre long, and though it's dark colouring makes it menacing, it is of the common garden variety.</p>
      <p>Christina ensured the snake didn’t venture around the house until her husband returned home and put him in the garden.</p>
      <p>She said: “My husband was on his way home already.</p>
      <p>“So I guarded the snake in the corner with my trusty broom until my husband got home, and then he put him back in the yard.”</p>

      <p>Between 7,000 and 8,000 people per year have venomous bites in the United states, and about five of those die, said the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
      <p>However, the number of deaths per year would be much higher if people hadn’t sought medical care.</p>
      <p>Disability and permanent injury, such as the loss or partial loss of finger or sensation, are much more common than fatalities.</p>
