      <h2>The Reach Football Project: End of the Decade | As the 2010s come to an end, we look at what could happen at Aston Villa between 2020 and 2030, including increasing Villa Park to 50,000-plus</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Martin O'Neill, Randy Lerner, Ajax at Villa Park, Remi Garde, relegation, Dr Tony Xia, a Birmingham City fan whacking Jack Grealish and promotion back to the Premier League - the last decade in claret and blue has been far from dull.</p>
      <p>Villa were flying high 10 years ago and blew what was a golden chance of, wait for it, Champions League football. O'Neill was close to finally cracking the top four but, after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-latest-news-history-17093676">playing the kids against CSKA Moscow</a>, form dipped and, months later, the once much-loved boss walked away on the eve of the 2010/11 season.</p>
      <p>Gerard Houllier was the next man in the hot seat before a severe heart problem forced the Frenchman to stand down. The former Liverpool boss was replaced by Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, an appointment which all-but burnt the bridge between fans and owner Lerner.</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa - End of Decade</h3>
      <p>Welcome to our Aston Villa 'End of Decade' series.</p>
      <p>We're looking back on the 'Teenies' - the last 10 years at AVFC.</p>
      <p>It's hardly been a vintage time for Villa, but at least it is ending with plenty of hope and optimism with the Lions finally back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>The New Yorker soon pulled the plug on player expenditure before overseeing the devastating relegation of 2016. Eccentric Chinese tycoon Dr Xia arrived and purchased Aston Villa for a cut-price £76m before yet more cash trouble saw the club saved as recently as last summer by Villa's incredibly-wealthy new owners, Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris, who soon appointed life-long Villan Dean Smith.</p>
      <p>Now, with Villa Park selling out each week and players such as Jack Grealish lighting it up on the pitch, there's no looking back. Here, in our latest Football Project: End of Decade piece, Club Writer <a href="https://twitter.com/PreeceObserver">Ashley Preece</a> picks out 10 things to expect from Aston Villa in the next decade.</p>
      <h3>1. Grealish's Gazza moment at World Cup</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17191722.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Jack-Grealish.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>We'll start with an obvious one: Jack Grealish donning the white of England and starring at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The 24-year-old captain will, of course, still be at Villa as the club, his club, enjoys more success. Grealish will be in his prime aged 27 by the time the tournament kicks off in November and would have a sackful of England caps to his name. Headlines will be adorned with 'The New Gazza' as Grealish lights it up playing in the No.10 role in Gareth Southgate's final tournament in charge of the Three Lions before being carded in the semi-finals and missing the World Cup final as the tears stream down his face.</p>
      <h3>2. Villa Park bumped up to 50,000</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17194066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1184509812.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Villa Park is ready to burst on matchdays and trying to get a ticket for the match nowadays is somewhat of an impossible task. The famous old ground has just witnessed its seventh-straight 40,000-plus crowd for a league game for the first time in 70 years and, in the years to come, you can expect the stadium to be boosted up to a 50,000-plus capacity to meet demand. They're literally queuing out the door at the minute and the owners, Edens and Sawiris, decide to revamp the North Stand. The corners will be filled in with the Stand itself adjoining the Trinity Road and Doug Ellis stands. It'll make for a wall of noise which will rival the Holte End and make Villa a much more intimidating venue for opposition teams.</p>
      <h3>3. King William and The Withe hotel</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17049954.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS195032607.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Staying with Villa Park, there will be a proper museum celebrating Villa's proud history. It will stand where the club shop is today and King William alongside tour guide stalwart, the brilliant Mick Dale, will cut the claret and blue ribbon on what'll be a special day in B6. The museum will be some size, too, and will be a community hub in the heart of Aston where you can grab a coffee and take in the club's rich traditions, see the trophies and take part in the odd Q&amp;A with club legends. Plans are also afoot to build the new hotel at the rear, too. It'll be called The Withe, referencing Villa's European Cup final goal-scorer, Peter Withe, and will feature claret and blue lighting and Villa-inspired decor throughout.</p>
      <h3>4. Tyrone becomes most-popular name</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17113256.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS196329700.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>On the pitch, Tyrone Mings keeps putting in dominating displays and remains one of the best centre-backs in the country. The defender keeps interacting with fans as he brilliantly does before it's announced that Tyrone is now the most-popular boys' name in England. He's already stood up to racists and continues to make a name for himself as the model professional, while inspiring the parents of tomorrow in baby name choices. Little Villa shirts everywhere now have Tyrone on the back at Villa Park and the new club store frantically runs out of letters.</p>
      <h3>5. Arise, Sir Dean</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17188314.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1176878424.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Keeping with the theme of inspiration, Dean Smith becomes Sir Dean Smith after receiving a knighthood from King William during the New Year Honours list. Smith has transformed Aston Villa into a vibrant, exciting and attacking outfit with record crowds cramming into the recently-increased Villa Park. Smith continues to blood young players from Bodymoor Heath and oversees the academy. The boss is thinking of becoming Director of Football, which leads us to point six.</p>
      <h3>6. JT becomes Villa gaffer</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Image: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>John Terry, Smith's former assistant, emotionally returns to the Villa Park dugout and takes the managerial baton. Things didn't work out the way he wanted it to at Chelsea after JT replaced Frank Lampard who took the Real Madrid job. Terry is forced to resign from Stamford Bridge after a disappointing few seasons before he's holding up the claret and blue shirt alongside Smith at Villa Park on unveiling day. Terry brings in recently-retired James Milner in as his assistant while owners Edens and Sawiris sanction the £50m transfer of Tammy Abraham who becomes Villa's new No.9.</p>

      <h3>7. 125th anniversary - and the return of the round badge</h3>
      <p>The year is 2025 and Villa celebrate its big 150th anniversary by bringing back the famous - and beautiful - round badge synonymous in the 80s. The new claret and blue crest features the current lion while incorporating a white star to mark the European Cup win of 1982. The Badge is Back is the club's marketing slogan on new kit unveiling day while the strip itself is based on the original - and first-ever - hooped 1847 version.</p>
      <h3>8. Roadblock for Tom Hanks in B6</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article11215952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Tom-HAnks.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Hollywood movie star Tom Hanks makes his first-ever visit to Villa Park and the streets surrounding the stadium are jam-packed. Traffic is brought to a standstill prior to a Premier League game with Chelsea, who have super-fan Will Ferrell in attendance as Hanks and the Elf star launch their new block-busting movie. Hanks appears on the pitch at half-time and shouts Up the Villa down the microphone, much to the delight of the Holte End, who sing: 'Tom Hanks, he's one of our own!'.</p>
      <h3>9. Ramsey replaces McGinn as Man Utd transfer gives Villa fans nightmares</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17193620.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS197507311.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Move over Jack Grealish, Aston Villa have a new wonderkid on the block in the form of Aaron Ramsey, younger brother of Jacob. Ramsey, who hails from the same neck of the woods as Dean Smith, has broken into the first-team and is playing in a three-man midfield alongside Grealish while representing England under-21s. Ramsey's emergence comes off the back of John McGinn's tragic transfer to Manchester United for £85m - and the early signs from the Great Barr kid are good.</p>
      <h3>10. Another Wembley win - and European return</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16477139.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Aston-Villa-v-Derby-County-Sky-Bet-Championship-Play-off-Final.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>And we'll round things off with a recent one: Aston Villa lift the Carabao Cup after seeing off Liverpool's under-23s previously while shocking Manchester United over two legs before beating Leicester City in the final at Wembley to confirm European football for the first time in 10 years. Dean Smith once again leads the celebrations on March 1 which go into the early hours before sealing Villa's Premier League status a few weeks later. Supporters wait patiently for the Europa League qualifying draw - only to get Motherwell as fans are forced to ditch the towels and flip flops.</p>
