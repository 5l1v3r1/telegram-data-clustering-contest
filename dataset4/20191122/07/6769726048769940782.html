      <p>Ritz Exterior Design (RED) is a premium landscape design and construction business, creating numerous award-winning luxury outdoor living areas in some of Perth’s most sought after locations.</p>
      <p>Director Guy Mouritz said he worked with his clients from design to construction to create a foundation of inspirational design and functionality, ensuring the outcome is always beautiful and practical.</p>
      <p>“We have been in landscape design in Perth for 20 years and our approach to every job has always been the same: to follow a simple process of consultation, landscape Perth design and construction,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Throughout the project we will manage all aspects of the job, from council approval through to completion, so you always talk to one person, not several different tradespeople.”</p>

      <p>The team at RED bring a wide range of skills and experience as well as a good measure of love to each project.</p>
      <p>“We prefer to do as much of the work ourselves as possible, but when the job requires it we select from the best tradespeople around, ones we know work well with us and understand how to work with others in different trades,” Guy said.</p>
      <p>“Our experience allows us to organise the vast range of tasks into an efficient work schedule, so you can be confident that the finished product will be as impressive as the landscape design.”</p>
      <p>RED was the overall winner of LIAWA’s Awards of Excellence in 2012 for design as well as the category winner of contractor residential for its <a href="https://www.ritzexterior.com.au/project/bicton/">Bicton residence.</a></p>
