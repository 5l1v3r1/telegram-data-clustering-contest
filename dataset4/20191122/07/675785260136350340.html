      <h1>Manny Pacquiao responds to Floyd Mayweather coming out of retirement</h1>
      <h2>Mayweather has claimed he will return to the ring in 2020, almost three years after beating Conor McGregor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:36:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Manny Pacquiao has welcomed Floyd Mayweather's decision to come out of retirement.</p>
      <p>The ring legend claimed on social media that he will return to the sport in 2020, almost three years after his win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> .</p>
      <p>And UFC president Dana White revealed he will work with Mayweather, as he did when he promoted his fight with McGregor.</p>
      <p>The pair had been courtside in Los Angeles to watch the Clippers defeat the Boston Celtics on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Pacquiao, meanwhile, has been chasing a rematch with his bitter rival since they fought in 2015.</p>

      <p>Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.</p>
      <p>Former super-middleweight world champion George Groves provides expert analysis.</p>

      <p>And in response to Mayweather's announcement, his manager told <i>The Athletic</i> : "Viva Floyd!! Letâ€™s Go Champ".</p>
      <p>Mayweather dominated the Filipino in Las Vegas four years ago but Pacquiao has remained at the elite level since, recording victories over Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman this year.</p>
      <p>But whether Mayweather will return to the ring himself or merely be involved in promotion a show with White remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>His comeback claim comes just days after insisted he would not return to the ring following a spate of deaths in the sport.</p>

      <p>"I've got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth," he told Reuters.</p>
      <p>"Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>
      <p>"You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career.</p>
      <p>"I'll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions; between $10 and $30 million.</p>
      <p>"I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting."</p>
