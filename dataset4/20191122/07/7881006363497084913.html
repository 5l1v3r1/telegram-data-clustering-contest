      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: TDP MP Jayadev Galla said that Home Ministry had released a new political map of India without Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh and said the matter should be immediately rectified.</p>
      <p>Raising the issue in Lok Sabha on Thursday, he said the contention that there was no gazette notification issued was "a frivolous and trivial argument".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The Ministry of Home Affairs has released a new political map of India. But we are shocked to see that Amaravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh is missing in this map. This is not only an insult to the people of Andhra Pradesh, but it is an insult to the Prime Minister who has laid the foundation stone for Amaravati in 2015," he said.</p>
      <p>"The contention that there was no gazette notification issued is a frivolous and trivial argument. If this map goes into circulation, it is going to impact the flow of investments into our new state. I request the government to immediately rectify this situation and issue a revised map showing Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh," he said.</p>
