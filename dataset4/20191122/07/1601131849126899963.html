      <h1>Samsung Galaxy Fold coming to Canada in early December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:36:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>Early next month, the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-fold/">Galaxy Fold</a> will go on sale in yet another country: Samsung has announced that the Galaxy Fold (LTE) <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/a-new-era-in-mobile-technology-first-foldable-smartphone-coming-to-canada-882256700.html">will be available in Canada from December 6</a>. The foldable device will only be available through Samsung Experience Stores in CF Sherway Gardens, CF Toronto Eaton Centre, Metropolis at Metrotown, West Edmonton Mall, and Yorkdale Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>The Canadian pricing for the Fold is $2,600 CAD, which translates to $1,980 USD, the same price the Fold commands in most other markets around the globe. It will be accompanied by the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/what-is-the-galaxy-fold-premier-service/">Galaxy Fold Premier Service</a>, which gets customers a one-time screen replacement for $199 as long as the device is purchased before May 31, 2020. They will also get direct 24/7 access to Samsung experts who will give them tailored guidance and support over the phone (by dialing 1-888-970-FOLD).</p>
      <p>Samsung notes that limited quantities of the Galaxy Fold will be available in Canada, and that means we can expect it to sell out quickly, as has been the case in most countries. Canada will get the Fold only in Cosmos Black, although Samsung could launch the Space Silver version in the country later down the line.</p>
      <p>Will you be picking up the Galaxy Fold once it launches in Canada?</p>
