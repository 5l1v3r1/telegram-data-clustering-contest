      <p>Robbie Williams pledged to take Liam Gallagher down.</p>
      <p>The singer, 45, branded his long-time frenemy a "school bully" in a scathing tirade about their ongoing feud.</p>
      <p>Outspoken Robbie confessed he has to get "even" with someone and cited his friendship with Gary Barlow as an example of this.</p>
      <p>The pop star said he was gearing himself up for a fight with his frenemy Liam yet he also divulged he admired him in the same breath.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/">The Sun</a> : "In the past I've been obsessed by getting even with people - and Gary [Barlow] was one of them. We had a sibling rivalry. We were the original Liam and Noel.</p>

      <p>"As for Liam, I admire him. He is the voice of a generation, the last of a dying breed, as pop stars are so boring these days.</p>
      <p>"But I still want to fight him. He represents a school bully to me and I would like to take the bully down."</p>
      <p>Despite once being friends in the 90s, the pair have since fallen out and continued to have take low blows at each other.</p>

      <p>Recently, they clashed over a venomous <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> spat.</p>
      <p>Knowing what he was in for, Robbie had no qualms dragging up their old feud just weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Robbie and Liam were briefly friends in the 90s and put on an incredibly friendly display at Glastonbury in 1995.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, the Let Me Entertain You flirted with their feud when he called on fans to abuse his rival on Twitter during a show at his Las Vegas residency in March.</p>
      <p>Robbie called upon Liam to fight him during the 2000 Brit Awards.</p>
      <p>Liam responded by labelling Robbie the "fat f****** idiot" on stage in 2010.</p>
