      <p>Mobile phone operator Vodafone has been reprimanded by the communications watchdog ComReg for failing to tell customers they would lose out on offers by topping up early.</p>
      <p>The company has been ordered to refund €416,971.79 to 72,774 customers.</p>
      <p>ComReg said Vodafone had failed to comply with customer information requirements over an 18-month period from September 2016 to March 2018.</p>
      <p>The issue related to the operator’s ‘Extra’ pay-as-you-go offers. ComReg determined that customers who topped up by €20 or €30 within 28 days of their last top-up were unaware that doing so would start a new offer cycle. This meant they lost out on any outstanding allowances as these were not carried forward after topping up.</p>
      <p>The investigation related to the manner in which customers were advised about the offer resetting.</p>
      <p>Vodafone accepted the findings and agreed to refund the customers and clarify its information practices.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: “Vodafone worked closely with ComReg on this matter. It specifically related to whether it was clear to customers that if they chose to top up before the 28-day cycle ended, their allowances would be reset and start a new offer cycle. Following discussions with ComReg, Vodafone revised certain offer communications and have agreed to apply credits to those customers impacted.”</p>
      <p>It is not the first time Vodafone has been ordered to refund pay-as-you-go customers. In 2017, ComReg ordered the company to issue more than €2.5m in refunds to pay-as-you-go customers who were automatically signed up to a roaming offer which saw their accounts charged €3 per day to use their existing packages within the EU.</p>
