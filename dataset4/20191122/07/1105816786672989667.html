      <p>Bollywood actor Jacqueline Fernandez recently opened about about her beauty secrets, goals and fitness routine.</p>
      <p>The multi-ethnic star, who is of Sri Lankan, Malaysian and Canadian decent, said that fitness is the key to her healthy routine. “Even if I do eat something that is a little off my diet, I work out a lot. I don’t feel so guilty about it then and I won’t reach out for such food as often because I don’t want to ruin all my hard work,” she revealed.</p>
      <p>“It’s basic, simple things that make the difference. Things like sugar, processed food and anything too high in fat I reduce. But days when I really feel like it, I do have it.”</p>
