      <h1>MMDA employee beaten up by bus driver, conductor in Pasig City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:59:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Manila" target="_blank">Coconuts Manila</a></address>
      <p>A traffic law enforcer from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) was allegedly socked in the face by a bus driver and a conductor this morning after he called them out for blocking a loading area along EDSA in Pasig City’s Ortigas Center.</p>
      <p>Arvin Gabay of the MMDA was assigned to the area near Robinsons Mall when he noticed that a bus was parked longer than necessary on EDSA’s loading and unloading area. Gabay approached the bus and <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/balitambayan/balita/716388/mmda-enforcer-ginulpi-ng-sinitang-bus-driver-at-konduktor/story/">scolded bus driver</a> Harold Dave Reyes and his assistant, Rolly Sabayon, the television news program “Balitanghali” reported.</p>
      <p>Instead of driving away, Reyes and Sabayon stepped out of the vehicle, arguing with Gabay and manhandling the MMDA officer because they didn’t like the tone of his voice.</p>
      <p>Gabay, the poor chap, ended up with a broken nose from the incident. He was <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/22/19/kawani-ng-mmda-binugbog-ng-sinitang-bus-driver-at-konduktor">taken by his colleagues</a> to the Medical City hospital for treatment, <i>ABS-CBN </i><i>News </i>reports.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the police have arrested Reyes and Sabayon, who will be charged for inflicting physical injuries on the MMDA officer. Reyes, the driver, will also be charged for driving with an expired license.</p>
