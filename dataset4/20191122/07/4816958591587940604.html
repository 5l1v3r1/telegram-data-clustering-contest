      <p>JAKARTA — Indonesian authorities suspect a Sumatran elephant found dead in a palm oil plantation may have been poisoned or electrocuted, marking the second time in a week a carcass of the critically endangered animal has been discovered, officials said.</p>
      <p>Only about 2,400-2,800 Sumatran elephants are left in the world, putting them on the brink of extinction, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old female elephant, which weighed three tonnes, was estimated to have been dead for about a week when found on Wednesday in the plantation in Aceh province, according to veterinarian from its Natural Resources Conservation Agency.</p>
      <p>“There were no physical wounds, which may indicate either death by electricity or poison but to be sure it has to be based on a laboratory test,” Agus Aryanto, the agency’s head, said by telephone.</p>
      <p>Elephants frequently enter plantations in the area to feed on palm oil fruits, especially during the rainy season, he said, adding a team had this week been trying to prevent elephants straying onto human settlements.</p>
      <p>Habitat loss and conflict with human have in recent years slashed the number of Sumatran elephants, which are found in tropical forests mainly on Sumatra and Borneo islands.</p>
      <p>Another male Sumatran elephant was found decapitated and with its tusks removed in Riau province on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Its tusks were cut off forcefully using a sharp tool,” said Heru Sutmantoro of the Natural Resources Conservation Agency in Riau. He said the elephant’s separated head and trunk were lying close to the carcass.</p>
      <p>Tests showed the 40-year-old elephant had no wounds and there was no indication of poisoning, he said.</p>
      <p>Poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife remain rampant in Indonesia, despite efforts by authorities to crack down.</p>
      <p>Under Indonesian law, poachers can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to 200 million rupiah ($14,200).</p>
      <p>This year, a Russian man was detained at the airport on the island of Bali trying to smuggle a young orangutan in a suitcase. (Reporting by Jessica Damiana and Tabita Diela Editing by Ed Davies, Robert Birsel)</p>
