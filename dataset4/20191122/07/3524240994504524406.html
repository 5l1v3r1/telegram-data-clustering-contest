      <p>The All Progressives Congress in Oyo State has called on the police and other security agencies to probe the role of Governor Oluseyi Makinde before, during and after the governorship election in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Makinde had temporarily relocated to Kogi few days to the November 16 poll until Sunday.</p>
      <p>The APC, in a statement by its Assistant Publicity Secretary, Mr Ayobami Adejumo, said it was “seriously worried” by the cases of violence reported in parts of Kogi.</p>
      <p>It lamented the aftermath of the election, “especially as this connects the incumbent governor of our dear Oyo State, who should also be investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on account of the government money spent on the ill-fated project.”</p>
      <p>The statement added, “We stand to condemn every act of violence, incitement and vote-buying which might have been recorded. The fact remains that no life of any individual is worth the votes being sought at polls by politicians.</p>
      <p>“The Oyo State governor’s clandestine hatchet job in Kogi was blown few hours to the polls when a team of security agents had to burst into a hide-out where some disgruntled elements had gathered to plan evil ahead of the elections.”</p>
      <p>According to the APC, Makinde “immediately” raised the alarm that he was attacked in a hotel.</p>
      <p>It stated, “The same governor commissioned his media handlers he deliberately left in Ibadan to twist the story and thus mislead the public.</p>
      <p>According to the party, the video clip of the “mindless confession, which apparently indicted Governor Makinde is currently available on virtually all social media platforms.”</p>
      <p>It added, “Without mincing words, keen watchers have come to realise that Makinde’s political history cannot be said to be free from damning evidence of violence sponsorship, financial inducements and propaganda.”</p>
