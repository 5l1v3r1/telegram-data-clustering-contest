      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Jacqueline Jossa snaps at Caitlyn Jenner after awkward soap slip-up</h1>
      <h2>Reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner was not impressed when she saw that more soap stars were entering I'm A Celeb</h2>

      <p>Caitlyn Jenner accidentally put her foot in it after voicing her frustration at the number of soap stars in the jungle this year... to former soap star Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Last night on I'm A Celebrity, it was revealed that ex-EastEnders actor Cliff Parisi, aka Minty, and Coronation Street's Andy Whyment were this year's late arrivals.</p>
      <p>Looking at their pictures on a poster, Caitlyn asked whether anyone in the camp knew who they were.</p>
      <p>Roman Kemp replied: "You know the one on the left it’s a guy from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> which is another big soap in the UK."</p>

      <p>Caitlyn immediately quipped: "What’s the deal with all these f***ing soap people?"</p>
      <p>Overhearing her, Jacqueline said: "Oi!"</p>
      <p>Grinning sheepishly, Caitlyn added as an apology: "Oh sorry."</p>
      <p>While Roman laughed over the awkward moment, Jacqueline looked less than impressed.</p>
      <p>And fans found the moment utterly hilarious.</p>

      <p>One tweeted with a picture of crying Jacqueline: "When Caitlyn slags off soap stars and forgets you’re in the camp #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>While another wrote: "Jacqueline jumping at caitlyn over the soap star comment ‍♀️awkward #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "Caitlin trying to figure out who all these soap stars are #ImACeleb."</p>
