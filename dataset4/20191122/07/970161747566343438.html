      <p>A woman with a history of attacks on people wearing fur has been charged with attempted murder for stabbing a woman at a church.</p>
      <p>The victim was stabbed in the arm twice and once in the abdomen with a kitchen knife in front of children she was babysitting while attending choir practice.</p>
      <p>Meredith Lowell, 35, was detained at the scene by a witness in Cleveland, Ohio, until police arrived.</p>
      <p>The victim is still in hospital, according to police chief Anne Mecklenburg, and it is not known if she was wearing real fur.</p>
      <p>Lowell was arrested last year for a similar attack at a branch of Whole Foods when she targeted someone she believed was wearing fur.</p>

      <p>In that incident she punched her victim then tried to stab her because her jacket had fake fur on the hood.</p>

      <p>She used the serrated blade of a Swiss Army knife and the jacket was cut, but the woman was not.</p>
      <p>Lowell was indicted in January on one count of felonious assault in Cuyahoga County. An online court docket shows she pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity last month. The case is pending.</p>
      <p>And in March 2012, Lowell was indicted in federal court in Cleveland after authorities said she posted on Facebook that she wanted to hire a hit man to kill someone wearing fur.</p>
      <p>Lowell wrote that she would be willing to pay between $830 and $850, according to an FBI affidavit.</p>
      <p>An undercover FBI agent contacted Lowell, who asked that a person be killed with a gun or a knife at a Cleveland Heights library and that she planned to be there when the murder was carried out, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Lowell told the agent she wanted to set up an animal rights militia and specified that a victim at the library should be at least 12 years old and at least 4 feet tall, the affidavit said. She was arrested in February 2012.</p>
      <p>Those charges were dropped in January 2013 when it was determined she could not be ‘rehabilitated to competency,’ court records show.</p>
      <p>For the most recent incident at a Presbyterian church in Cleveland Heights she is being held on a $1million bond.</p>
