Shuaibu Ibrahim, the DG NYSC <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/31/minimum-wage-for-corps-members-nysc-awaits-directive-from-minister/">disclosed that the scheme is awaiting directives from the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning</a>, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, on when to begin the payment of the N30,000 new minimum wage to corps members.</p>
      <p>The DG said serving corps members would be contacted about the payment once the NYSC gets details on the commencement of payment from the finance minister.</p>
      <h3>We will turn Sports into business to create jobs and generate revenue – Dare</h3>
      <p>In related news, Dare has assured  that his Ministry is committed to the delivery of the dividends of good governance to the citizens, through the promotion of greater private sector investment in the Sports Sector.</p>
      <p>He said this in his opening remarks at the Inter Ministerial Technical Session on Sports Industry Development organised  by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in collaboration with the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG).</p>
      <p>The Minister while laying emphasis on the specific targets for every sector of the economy within the Next Level Agenda Administration handed down by President Muhammadu Buhari,  he said, “Derivable for the Sports Sector, within the Agenda can be categorized in the twin goals of developing appropriate Public Private Partnership model and delivering on the establishment of a private sector driven Sports Development Fund to support, as well as, invest in various programmes and Sport facilities”.</p>
      <p>“The overarching goals of these initiatives aside creation of wealth and jobs are to</p>
      <p>In order to achieve these set targets, the Sports Industry Thematic Group was born through the Ministry’s interactions with the organized private sector using the platform of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG)”, he added.</p>
      <p>He said  the Ministry’s desire was to pursue the set targets vigorously in line with the declaration in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,</p>
      <p>“…sport to the realization of development and peace in its promotion of tolerance and respect and the contributions it makes to the empowerment of women and of young people, individuals and communities as well as to health, education and social inclusion objectives”.</p>
      <p>He then disclosed  that the NESG and the Ministry are working on a policy framework for achieving these goals.</p>
      <p>“Commendable progress has been made in this regard as we have now thought it necessary to move to the next phase of sharing this vision and to solicit the cooperation and buy-in of sister agencies as a prelude to a launch to the larger private sector groups”, Dare disclosed.</p>
      <p>While highlighting the importance of  Private sector  partnerships with the Public sector in tapping into the business potentials of the Sports Sector, he stressed the need  for a framework for tapping into the business potentials of sports development and its commercialization, which will be provided by  a National Sports Policy.</p>
      <p>“It is imperative that the National Sports Policy Document is tailored to reach mutual understanding, vision, policy and targets in the field of sports. It will also provide coordination and cooperation in the services and activities of the relevant public institutions, organizations and non-governmental organizations as well as other stakeholders.”</p>
      <p>“The proposed Policy is a roadmap towards the achievement of national development goals related to healthy living, economic growth and sustainability, promotion of equity and excellence, in addition to creating wealth and employment for the citizenry. This process involves robust national consultations that have identified national development priorities as well as global development trends and best practice models.”</p>
      <p>Outlining the roles of the Inter-Ministerial consultation, he said “The Inter-Ministerial Technical Session (IMTS) will enable participants brainstorm and harmonise strategies to address the cross-cutting, cross-sectoral issues arising from the challenges militating against the development of a viable sports business in Nigeria”.</p>
      <p>“Breakout Sessions will discuss the key technical issues identified within the relevant Ministry and articulate the role each Ministry plays in contributing to the National Sports Policy.”</p>
      <p>The  Minister expressed hope that at the end of Inter Ministerial Technical Session, among other things, the commitment and buy-in of the various MDAs through the Ministers, their Permanent Secretaries and Directors would  be secured for a vibrant and comprehensive National Sports Policy.</p>
