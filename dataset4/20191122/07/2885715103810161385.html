      <p>The NIA special court on Thursday reserved the order on the bail plea of Ajay Gupta, a key accused in 532 kg heroin haul case. The court has fixed November 25 as the next date of hearing.</p>
      <p>Ajay Gupta also produced certified copies of his bank statement as proof of payments to two Pakistan-based companies from whom he imported salt. Gupta’s counsel, <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/532-kg-heroin-haul-nia-opposes-accuseds-bail-says-he-must-show-bills-for-imports-from-pak-6126529/">A S Longia, informed the court that the payments were made between August 2018 and April 2019.</a></b></p>
      <p>According to Gupta’s bank statement which he produced in the court, he made four payments of USD 2070, 1800, 2700 and 5400 to Lahore-based Aimex General Trading and Global Vision Impex.</p>
      <p>The NIA, however, contested the claims of Gupta and said that the records submitted by him needed to be verified as these were shell companies being operated by Pakistan spy agency ISI to send drugs to India.</p>
      <p>“We have searched online, these are shoddy payments, we wanted to verify all the records, we searched on the website of Federal Board of Revenue of Pakistan, we found that the companies to which the payments were made were created for only receiving the payments and in the guise of business the drugs are being sent to India,” NIA’s Senior Prosecutor Surinder Singh told the court.</p>
      <p>Surinder Singh also informed the court that the agency needed some time to verify all the documents as it is a larger conspiracy. The court, meanwhile, asked the NIA that if Ajay Gupta was involved in the case then why the agency did not seek his custody for interrogation.</p>
      <p>Gupta was on judicial remand till he was nominated in the case by NIA for the past around five months.</p>
      <p>The agency had alleged that Ajay Gupta, a Chartered Accountant (CA) by profession, was the man who used to receive the drugs consignments and was in contact with the main accused Tariq Lone.</p>
