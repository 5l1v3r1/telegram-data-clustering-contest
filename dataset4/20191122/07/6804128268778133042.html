      <h1>Fikayo Tomori the captain and a second Champions League: 10 predictions for Chelsea in the 2020s</h1>
      <h2>In our latest end of the decade piece, a look at what could happen in the next 10 years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <h3>Frank Lampard to be longest-serving manager of the Abramovich era</h3>
      <p>An easy prediction to make now, with things going so well on the pitch, but Lampard seems likely to become the club’s longest-serving manager of the Roman Abramovich era. He has a three-year deal and, unless things go horribly wrong, that would bring him to about 160 games depending on cup progress. The longest spell since Abramovich took over the club was Jose Mourinho’s first, when he managed 185 games.</p>
      <h3>Tammy Abraham, the Premier League’s most consistent goalscorer</h3>
      <p>Questions remain over whether the striker can maintain his scoring form. Will he suffer a dip as the campaign progresses? Can he find the net against the big teams? Yet it also seems inevitable that he will develop into one of the country’s most consistent strikers, someone to rival Harry Kane in the golden boot race and the England team for years to come.</p>
      <h3>Academy trumps big spending post-transfer ban</h3>
      <p>Now we have seen the capabilities of the young players, it looks like the club will stick to their faith in academy products long-term. That does not mean they will become scroungers in the transfer market but the days of spending big instead of giving young players already at the club may well be over now Abraham, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and others have made their mark in the first team.</p>
      <h3>End of the loan army</h3>
      <p>At the same time Fifa are looking to change the rules surrounding loans and that could mean an end for the club’s so-called army. Last season Chelsea had 49 players at temporary clubs but critics see it as stockpiling talent in search of a financial profit and the regulations will likely become more restrictive in the next decade.</p>
      <h3>Stamford Bridge resolution</h3>
      <p>The stadium redevelopment is on hold since May 2018 “due to the current unfavourable investment climate” and the club have denied rumours that they may be looking at other sites to build a new ground. But with all their competitors playing in front of bigger home grounds something needs to give.</p>
      <h3>Tomori to be a future captain</h3>
      <p>This one is more of a longshot because there are so many variables but the young centre back has looked impressive this season and appears to be a budding leader too. He is articulate, a players’ player, gets the club and leads by example with his performances. His presence will only become greater as time goes on.</p>
      <h3>The next academy players to make first team</h3>
      <p>They conveyor belt is moving fast. Who is next to graduate from the youth ranks to the first team? Billy Gilmour finds himself somewhere between the two having featured sporadically for Lampard in midfield, while Marc Guehi's promise at centre back is obvious. Tino Anjorin and Ian Maatsen have featured in the Carabao Cup, so seem like reasonable bets to make the grade, while midfielder Conor Gallagher has been tearing it up on loan at Charlton Athletic.</p>

      <h3>Kings of Europe again</h3>
      <p>Winning the Champions League remains the ultimate goal and the fact that only Real Madrid have won the trophy back-to-back in the past decade, with nine different clubs being crowned the kings of Europe since the turn of the century, gives plenty of reason to be optimistic.</p>
      <h3>America's team</h3>
      <p>There are already signs of Chelsea becoming the Premier League club for American fans. Most of that is down to Christian Pulisic's arrival and recent success. As long as he remains at the Bridge, expect pre-season trips across the Atlantic and heightened interest in the Blues across the States. Liverpool and Manchester United are commercially ahead of Chelsea in Asia but cornering a big section of the US market would bring huge financial benefits.</p>
      <h3>More former players to take up coaching and advisory roles</h3>
      <p>It's not just Frank Lamaprd and his backroom staff. Among others, Petr Cech, Ashley Cole, Torre Andre Flo, Claude Makelele and Joe Cole have all taken roles at the club in the past 18 months. The familiarity certainly helps and other former stars are likely to join up in the coming years.</p>
