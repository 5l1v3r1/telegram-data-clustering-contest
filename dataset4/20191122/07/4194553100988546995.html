      <h1>Liverpool’s Brazilian star Fabinho set for new contract talks – Telegraph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:13:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Fabinho is already being touted for a contract extension, despite only signing for Liverpool in 2018.</p>
      <p>That’s according to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/making-fabinho-counting-birds-jose-mourinhos-hotel-visit-jurgen/">Telegraph</a>, with journalist Caio Carrieri suggesting the club plan to open talks soon – at the end of his long piece on Fabinho’s upbringing and rise from Real Madrid and AS Monaco to Liverpool…</p>
      <p>Many Reds would argue Fabinho has been our Player of the Season so far.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been practically faultless in holding midfield and he truly is one of the first names on the team-sheet.</p>
      <p>Fabinho has become as important to our spine as Alisson or Virgil van Dijk, such is the solidity and consistency he provides the midfield.</p>
      <p>He’ll still have years left on his current deal, but an extension would be just reward for the manner in which he’s established himself as likely the best anchoring midfielder on the planet.</p>
      <p>All Liverpool’s best players are now tied to the club for the best years of their careers, which gives us a genuine chance to win every trophy we compete for.</p>
      <p>The next few years could be very, very special.</p>
