      <h1>ICE Officially Confirms Dec. 9 Launch of Cash-Settled Bitcoin Futures</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> platform has officially confirmed its forthcoming launch of a cash-settled Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) futures contract.</p>
      <p>In a news release <a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/press-releases/all-categories/2019/11-21-2019-235911370">published</a> Nov. 22, ICE — the operator of 23 leading global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange — revealed that the contract will be listed on ICE Futures Singapore as of Dec. 9.</p>
      <h3>Rule changes open to review until Nov. 29</h3>
      <p>During the Invest: NYC conference earlier this month, Bakkt COO Adam White had been the first to publicly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-plans-to-roll-out-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures-contract">reveal</a> Bakkt had its sights on a cash-settled option. </p>
      <p>Today’s announcement formally confirms the details leaked to the press by insider sources, specifically that the contract will be cleared by ICE Clear Singapore and has sealed approval from the city state’s de facto central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
      <p>As ICE outlines, the new Bakkt Bitcoin Cash Settled Monthly Futures will be settled against data from its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkts-much-anticipated-bitcoin-futures-trading-platform-goes-live">existing</a> physically delivered Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures contract — a pioneering product that was the first to give futures traders <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ices-bakkt-ceo-platform-wont-support-margin-trading-contracts-to-be-fully-collateralized">direct exposure</a> to the underlying cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>ICE Singapore has published details of the contract specifications and proposed rule changes and invited parties to submit comments on these by Nov. 29.</p>
      <h3>Crypto twitter divided</h3>
      <p>While Bakkt’s physically-delivered contract was almost <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-bakkt-to-improve-trust-with-institutions-to-crypto-in-3-days">unanimously</a> hailed by the cryptocurrency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pompliano-bitcoin-will-be-in-every-institutional-investors-portfolio">community</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-bakkt-to-improve-trust-with-institutions-to-crypto-in-3-days">industry</a> as a milestone, social media responses to Adam White’s <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteAdamL/status/1197670769985294336?s=20">retweet</a> of ICE’s confirmation have been more <a href="https://twitter.com/ercrypto741/status/1197705296233160705?s=20">ambivalent</a>.</p>
      <p>Cash-settled Bitcoin futures — which have been trading since December 2017 on both CME and CBOE —  have <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-7-400-amid-futures-volatility-eyes-7-000-support">consistently</a> drawn suspicion, with some <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-manipulated-before-futures-settlement-dates-research">contending</a> that Bitcoin’s price is vulnerable to manipulation in advance of contract settlements.</p>
