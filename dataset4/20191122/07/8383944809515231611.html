      <h1>Tesla suffers broken glass mishap during first-ever electric pickup truck launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:45:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author">COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES</a></address>
      <p>The big reveal of Tesla's electric pickup went embarrassingly wrong when the supposedly impact-proof windows smashed, leaving a flustered Elon Musk to flounder through the rest of his presentation in front of a badly damaged vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Tesla co-founder unveiled the all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck in California on Thursday, daring staff to hit the vehicle with sledgehammers and showing a video of it withstanding bullets shot from a 9mm gun.</p>
      <p>But the demonstration of the vehicle's indestructible windows didn't appear to go entirely to plan after one assistant threw a steel ball bearing at the truck – only to see the armored glass smash.</p>
      <p>An expletive could be heard at the Tesla Design Center and as his assistant laughed nervously, Musk said: "Well, maybe that was a little too hard."</p>
      <p>A second attempt fared little better however, and another window was left badly damaged.</p>
      <p>"It didn't go through," said a clearly uncomfortable Musk, who was forced to push on through the remainder of the chaotic launch with the two smashed windows in full view.</p>
      <p>The industrial-looking Cybertruck – covered in the same steel alloy Musk plans to use for his SpaceX rocket – will have a starting price of $39,900 and can go from 0 to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in about three seconds, the Tesla chief executive claimed.</p>
      <p>No date has been given for its release but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Tesla dominates the global electric car market and has an especially firm grip on the United States.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FORD, GM GEAR UP TOO</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tesla's focus on the high-performance end of the market is only natural given the success of Ford's 450-horsepower F-150 Raptor truck, which launched in 2009 and whose sales have since risen annually, according to Ford spokesman Mike Levine.</p>
      <p>While Ford does not disclose Raptor sales, Levine said annual demand is well above 19,000 vehicles and the No. 2 U.S. automaker has never had to offer incentives on the model, which costs in the high $60,000 range. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup.</p>
      <p>Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups.</p>
      <p>Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.</p>
      <p>Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.</p>
      <p>Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment – both full- and mid-sized models – will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate.</p>
      <p>Ford aims to sell an electric F-series in late 2021, sources familiar with the plans said. It also will offer the Mach E next year as part of its plan to invest $11.5 billion by 2022 to electrify its vehicles.</p>
      <p>In April, Ford invested $500 million in startup Rivian, which plans to build its own electric pickup beginning in fall 2020.</p>
      <p>GM plans to build a family of premium electric pickup trucks and SUVs, with the first pickup due to go on sale in the fall of 2021. It plans to invest $8 billion by 2023 to develop electric and self-driving vehicles.</p>
