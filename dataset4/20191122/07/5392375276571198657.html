      <p>Realme X2 Pro will get ColorOS 7 before the end of 2019<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>One of the layers of customization in the spotlight during the last months is that of Oppo. The company manufactures incredible devices with a very good quality/price ratio. The problem comes when we take a look at ColorOS, the user interface of Oppo smartphones. This has important failures, a problem when displaying notifications and a design that is not as attractive as we would like. A couple of days ago it was presented in China ColorOS 7, the new layer based on Android 10 that will reach the devices of Oppo and Realme. Today we review the list and also tell you details that you should keep in mind.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Realme">Realme</a> offers one of the best options of the moment in the market, it seems that the support of updates will not be its forte. In China, official updates have been scheduled for several months, something that users do not welcome. Today we have half good news for the Realme X2 Pro.</p>
      <h3>The Realme X2 Pro will have ColorOS 7 beta in 2019</h3>

      <p>We do not know the reason why Realme has announced the official update for April 2020. On this date, they will update devices such as the Realme X2, the X2 Pro and some others that are only sold in China. The strategy for global markets is unknown. Although we can know that there will be a beta program for some users who have trusted the brand. Again, we donâ€™t know if it will be global or only for China.</p>
      <p>This beta program will arrive in December and will allow users of a Realme X2 Pro to upgrade to Android 10 and ColorOS 7. Of course, in beta, with what this entails. It will not be a stable version and will be launched many months before the official one. So the failures could be counted by tens.</p>
      <p>ColorOS 7 is a necessary update for all Realme and Oppo devices. But the company seems to take the update process calmly. At the moment the situation with Realme and the updates is complicated. As the official announcements are for many months away when all the companies have updated their devices. Still, the <a href="https://www.weibo.com/7034060236/IhcYemOMh">good news</a> of the beta by the end of the year still a hope for Realme X2 Pro.</p>
