      <p>He also posted a splash emoji, which is often used to signal sex.</p>
      <p>Jason may have posted the saucy snap to distract his fans from the recent backlash he has faced over his new movie Cats.</p>
      <p>The singer turned actor recently responded to the relentless criticism of his upcoming film Cats.</p>
      <p>He told the Australian publication Confidential that he was shocked by the divisive reaction when the trailer dropped.</p>

      <p>"I don't think I have ever seen such a polarising reaction from any other trailer ever,"Jason said.</p>
      <p>He saw the original stage show and believes the confronting visuals were a part of the experience.</p>
      <p>"I knew that was what it would be from the jump and that is what I hoped it would be because that is what I felt like was the magic of the stage play," Jason said.</p>
      <p>"It is unlike anything that you've ever seen before so everything that has been said about it being creepy or left and weird, it is all of that and more," he added.</p>
      <p>The film trailer got a mixed response when it was released with some thinking it was "creepy".</p>
      <p>The big screen adaptation sees the rapper play the role of  Rum Tum Tugger.</p>
      <p>Like the stage version, the ilm version of Cats is based on the poems of T S Eliot.</p>
