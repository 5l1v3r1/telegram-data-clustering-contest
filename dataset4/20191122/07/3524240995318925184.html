        <b>Success Nwogu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party has<br/>recommended the setting-up of a committee to probe the actions of PDP members which made the party to lose Kogi and Bayelsa states in the November 16 elections.</p>
      <p>Recall that PDP had lost the governorship election in Bayelsa State,<br/>while the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, who was the<br/>governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>The PDP BoT Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin, in an interview with<br/>journalists in Abuja, said the BoT, during its meeting, noted the<br/>accusations and counter-accusations against its members.</p>
      <p>He said adequate punishment will be recommended for those<br/>found culpable.</p>
      <p>He added that the probe was not on a specific individual but generally.</p>

      <p>He also said the BoT recommended a peace committee to probe into the issues in Edo, Lagos and Kano.</p>
      <p>Jibrin said, “We recommended a committee that will investigate the<br/>outcome of the election in Kogi and Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“We are very concerned with what is happening in Nigerian politics,<br/>especially recently in Kogi and Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“We reviewed the situation and condemned in totality the issue of rigging, killings and ballot box snatching that characterised this election; we reviewed the arson that took place, including the death of a Ward chair lady of PDP in Kogi. Such things must stop.</p>
      <p>“We also viewed the accusations and counter-accusations among our<br/>members on the behaviour of some of our members both in Kogi and<br/>also in Bayelsa, especially in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“We advised that we must make thorough research before we come into conclusion of who did what and suggest remedies.</p>
      <p>“Therefore we recommended to the National Working Committee that a very serious investigation must take place.</p>
      <p>“We recommended that an interim committee must be set up, similar to the one that was set up after the 2015 election under the chairmanship of former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and myself.”</p>
      <p>A source who pleaded not to be named told our Correspondent that some members present during the meeting lambasted the National Chairman, Uche Secondus, for some of his actions which they felt were not good for the party.</p>
      <p>The source said at a stage, some members wanted to move a vote of no confidence on Secondus, and that, the national chairman, on<br/>sensing danger, left the meeting.</p>
      <p>But the BoT chairman said it was incorrect that attempt was made to<br/>pass a vote of no confidence on Secondus or that he was castigated.</p>
      <p>He stated that Secondus briefed the BoT and left the meeting to attend to other party matters, adding that at no time was the issue of vote of no confidence discussed.</p>
