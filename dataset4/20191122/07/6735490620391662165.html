      <p>Winfrey’s speech included, “While she’s no longer on this earth, her magnificent soul, her boundless imagination, her fierce passion, her gallantry.</p>
      <p>“She told me once, ‘I’ve always known I was gallant.’ Who says that? Who even knows they are gallant? Well, her gallantry remains always to help us navigate our way through.”</p>
      <p>Winfrey also recalled the time she asked Morrison if it was true that people had to re-read her books to understand them.</p>
