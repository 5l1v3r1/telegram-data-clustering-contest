      <p>Floyd Mayweather has revealed that he is coming out of retirement in 2020 and will be working alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> president Dana White.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, whose professional boxing record stands at 50-0, last fought in August 2017 when he beat <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conor-mcgregor/">Conor McGregor</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Since then, Mayweather has participated in an exhibition fight last December against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.</p>
      <p>Mayweather earned $9 million (£7m) for that contest <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/31/floyd-mayweather-destroys-tenshin-nasukawa-swift-ko-first-round-8295937/">and beat Nasukawa, who was undefeated at that time, in less than three minutes</a>.</p>
      <p>Mayweather has now revealed that he will be ending his retirement next year to work with White, which could suggest another exhibition bout could be on the cards.</p>

      <p>Speaking earlier this week, Mayweather was adamant that he would not be returning to boxing.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth,’ he told Reuters.</p>
      <p>‘Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>

      <p>‘You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions; between $10 and $30 million.</p>
      <p>‘I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting.’</p>
