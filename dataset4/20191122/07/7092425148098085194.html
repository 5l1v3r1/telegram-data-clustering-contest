        <b>Formerly known as Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn admits she has no problem with her children still calling her "Dad"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest scoop about the Kardashian and Jenner clan was revealed on last night's airing of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner opened up on her six Jenner children, as well as four Kardashian stepchildren and a whopping 19 grandkids.</p>
      <p>With another grandchild on the way in December, Caitlyn sure has one big family. It was what her clan still calls her that perked our interests.</p>
      <p>During an intimate chat with fellow campmates Kate Garraway, Jacqueline Jossa, Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts, Caitlyn admitted her kids still call her "Dad".</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old said: "My kids all call me Dad, Kendall asked me first and I said ‘Dad’, I’m your Dad and I’ll always be your Dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>"But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my Dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it."</p>

      <p>When Good Morning Britain presenter Garraway quizzed Jenner on her grandkids, Catlyn revealed the name they call her to avoid confusion over gendered titles.</p>
      <p>"They’ve come up with Boom Boom. It kinda stuck, it was easy for them to say," confessed Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>Kate also asked if Caitlyn felt like a father to her kids, with Jenner responding:</p>
      <p>"Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them."</p>
      <p>Both Kate and Jacqueline expressed that her outlook was lovely.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, came out publicly as a trans woman in April 2015.</p>
      <p>In January 2015, she underwent gender reassignment surgery. A 2017 memoir titled "The Secrets of My Life" explores her path on becoming a transgender woman.</p>
