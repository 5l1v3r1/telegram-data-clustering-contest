      <h1>Irish weather forecast: More rain on the way with "heavy falls" in the east and spot flooding</h1>
      <h2>Low pressure is set to dominate the coming days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:07:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/edel-hughes/" target="_blank">Edel Hughes</a></address>
      <p>More rain is on the way but we'll see a slight increase in temperatures next week after the cold spell.</p>
      <p>It was a wet day across the south and southeast yesterday with 11.4mm of rain recorded at Cork Airport and 5.6mm falling at Shannon Airport.</p>
      <p>And we haven't seen the last of it as an area of low pressure will dominate the coming days bringing more showers.</p>
      <p>The east will see the worst of the rain today with some "heavy falls" occurring later on.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/met-eireann">Met Eireann</a> forecaster said: "Mostly cloudy to begin today, with showers or longer spells of rain in places, but some brighter intervals developing in the south this morning.</p>
      <p>"Brightening up elsewhere this afternoon but further showers or spells of rain will continue to occur, especially over the eastern half of the country, with some heavy falls."</p>

      <p>Heading into Friday night, we'll see some more "persistent and occasionally heavy rain" near the east coast.</p>
      <p>The rain will gradually spread westwards, bringing spot flooding, mainly in eastern areas.</p>
      <p>There's also a risk of frost tonight with lows of 1C to 5C.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Saturday will be a "rather dull and wet day" in midland, eastern and northern areas with outbreaks of rain, heavy at times.</p>
      <p>The west and southwest will see drier and brighter conditions with just a few showers, however, mist and fog patches may be slow to clear in these parts during the morning.</p>

      <p>Outbreaks of rain will clear northeastwards on Saturday night, with lows of 0C to 5C and a risk of frost, coldest in the south.</p>
      <p>A low pressure weather system will dominate the coming days, Met Eireann revealed, with more rain on Sunday,Â  the heaviest of the showers are likely to affect southern and later eastern coastal counties.</p>
