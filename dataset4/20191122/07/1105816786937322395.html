      <h1>China wants US trade deal but 'not afraid' to fight back: Xi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:13:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>BEIJING: </b>President Xi Jinping said Friday that China wants to reach an initial trade deal with the United States but is “not afraid” to fight back when necessary.</p>
      <p>Xi made the remarks two days after US President Donald Trump complained that Beijing had not made sufficient concessions so far, making him reluctant to conclude a bargain.</p>
      <p>The world’s two biggest economies have been locked in a bruising trade conflict for more than a year, hitting each other with volleys of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods.</p>
      <p>“As we always said we don’t want to start the trade war but we are not afraid,” Xi told former US officials and other foreign dignitaries at a meeting in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People.</p>

      <p>“When necessary we will fight back but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war,” he told the group, which included former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former US treasury secretary Henry Paulson and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.</p>
      <p>Top trade negotiators spoke on the phone on Saturday in what the Chinese commerce ministry described as “constructive” discussions on a preliminary deal.</p>
      <p>China has insisted on a rollback of existing tariffs, which Trump said he has not agreed to.</p>
      <p>US Congress approved this week of legislation supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong has also cast a shadow on the negotiations.</p>
      <p>“We want to work for a phase-one agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality,” Xi told the foreign visitors, who were in town for the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.</p>
