      <p>Since the fall of the Matebeleland Kingdom at Gadade in November 1893, our Kingdom has been in a journey of fighting for its freedom and the Restoration of the Rights of its people and Africans in general. This must inspire hope, will-power and vision in all of us to advance the Restoration of our Rights in all corners of Matebeleland. Hope, will-power and vision is important in life. These are fuel rods for the emancipation of the oppressed to gain freedom and human dignity. They are inspirational. They are a cornerstone for survival. Without hope, will-power and vision we are all doomed.<br/><br/>As a way of recap, we all know that the first violation of our sacred human rights as a people began with colonialism. Colonialism led to the destruction of our Kingdom in November 1893. Colonialism attempted to switch off hope, will-power, vision and dignity of our people just as Matebele genocide made such attempts. We also know that the destruction of our Kingdom led to further systematic violations of our human rights as a people with the intention to totally extinguish any hope, will-power and vision we may have had of restoring our rights and dignity as a people.<br/><br/>One of the cardinal violations of these rights after the destruction of our Kingdom was the unification of our Kingdom with Mashonaland on 23rd January 1894 to form a country called South Zambesia, which was later renamed Southern Rhodesia. All this unification and renaming was meant to extinguish hope, will power and vision for us to advance the cause of the Restoration of our Rights as a people.<br/><br/>The unification of our Kingdom with Mashonaland had no expressed mandate or informed consent from our people or from the people of Mashonaland. It was and remains an enforced union that violated and continues to violate the fundamental human rights of the people of Matebeleland as well as the fundamental human rights of the people of Mashonaland, despite the union favouring the people of Mashonaland at present.<br/><br/>We however know that this has created a burden of rule by conquest of Matebeleland by the elite leadership of Mashonaland, creating as system we call Shona Hegemony or privilege. This rule by conquest and subjugation of Matebeleland led to genocide being used as a weapon of conquer against the people of Matebeleland and as a lauch-pad for the Shona hegemony system, a system that ranks any Shona person as a 1st class citizen of that country with a privilege to access all Rights at the expense of the Matebele .<br/><br/>Post the occupation and unification of our Kingdom with Mashonaland, there have been several wars fought for the Restoration of our Rights as a people dating back to 1893. These wars include Umvukela wokuqala wamaNdebele popularly known as the second Matebele War in English. This war was led by our illustrious Queen Lozikeyi Dlodlo, wife of King Lobhengula. It was also inspired by the spiritual leader of Matebeleland Kingdom called Mlimo.<br/><br/>In later years, our cause for the Restoration of our Rights and that of other Africans was to be led by Joshua Mqabuko Nyongolo Nkomo under the banner of the Zimbabwe African Peoples' Union (Zapu) leading to the "independence" of Zimbabwe that unfortunately ushered in African oppressors and human rights violators in the form of Zanu PF under the leadership of the late dictator, Robert Gabriel Mugabe.<br/><br/>Our commitment to the Restoration of the Rights of other Africans was also demonstrated in the support of South African people's rights to free themselves from the yoke of apartheid. This was demonstrated by supporting ANC and its military wing uMkhonto Wesizwe to advance the cause for the Restoration of the Rights of all South Africans regardless of their ethnic orientation, religious persuasion or their race.<br/><br/>However, Zanu PF quickly undermined the agenda for the Restoration of our rights and that of our African brothers. Within a year of independence, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, the then Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, made a state visit to North Korea to seek assistance to form a brigade he and his cronies termed the 5th Brigade of Zimbabwe, whose sole purpose was to commit an ethnic genocide against the people of Matebeleland in the 80s so as to advance and extend the ruling of Matebeleland by conquest means. As he committed this genocide, he collaborated with apartheid South Africa to thwart the advance of Umkhonto weSizwe to liberate South Africa. In turn South Africa created pseudo-dissidents for him to justify and rationalize genocide of the Matebele. This genocide also created a launch-pad for the long term systematic violation of the Rights of the people of Matebeleland in all the facets of life for the past 39 years.<br/><br/>This long term systematic violation of the Rights of the people of Matebeleland after the genocide focused on land dispossessions, cultural genocide, and marginalization in recruitment and training in education and health both at college and university level, marginalization in accessing government scholarships, marginalization in police, army and border post recruitments, marginalization in accessing funds to start-up businesses, marginalization in state government ministerial deployment positions, diplomatic deployments and marginalization in both private and public employment organizations.<br/><br/>The long systematic violation of the Rights of the people of Matebeleland after the genocide continued with its ugly head at primary education level, where the Matebele children's language rights have been wantonly violated for the past 39 years with deployment of teachers who totally do not know local languages. There has been an on-going language genocide in Matebeleland schools since 1980 to date.<br/><br/>While facing challenges of both white and black dominance and oppression, all that we have always wanted is to Restore our Rights as a people and in the process restore our dignity and dignity of others. The quest for freedom from oppression and exploitation is real and palpable in our Nation.<br/><br/>Our diversity in Matebeleland is unique and is our greatest strength rather than a weakness. It must inspire hope and unity in all of us. It must be deployed by all and sundry to our advantage so as to advance the cause of the Restoration of our Rights as a people and a Nation.<br/><br/>We continue to observe and notice that the regime that conducted genocide in our nation continues with its genocidal and human rights and we have observed it extending its human rights violations to whites and to the people of Mashonaland.<br/><br/>We strongly condemn the regime's human rights violations taking place in that country. Such human rights violations remind us of the human rights violations we have suffered and continue to suffer as the Matebele since the regime came to power in 1980.<br/><br/>We strongly condemn the recent marginalization and violation of the Rights of our people to education and professional training as demonstrated by hardly any recruitment of our people into nurse training in local Matebeleland Schools of Nursing. The revelations of the statics of this deliberate and systemic exclusion of the Matebele in Nurse training and other Colleges and Universities of Higher learning is not a new phenomenon but has been on-going for the past 39 years. It is time to roll back the visible contours of oppression, human rights violations and conquest agendas in our territory.<br/><br/>The 1893 Mthwakazi Human Rights Restoration Movement (1893 MHRRM) is calling on the diverse Nation of Mthwakazi to come together to advance the cause of the Nation's interests and human rights in order to restore our dignity as a people. The advancement of our Nation's interests and human rights will restore dignity in our Nation and invariably restore dignity in other nations who face human rights violations from brutal regimes around the world. Nations that violate the rights of other Nations have no dignity and self-respect. They need liberation from undignified and inhuman actions they deploy unto others.<br/><br/>It is incumbent upon all the people of Matebeleland to be seized with hope, will-power and vision to advance the Restoration of our Human Rights as a people including advancing the principle of the Right to Self-Determination for the full Restoration of the Kingdom of Matebeleland.</p>
