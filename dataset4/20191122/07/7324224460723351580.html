      <p>Colts running back Jonathan Williams ran in from 13 yards to score Indianapolis’ second rushing touchdown of the night and put them 17-10 up midway through the third quarter.</p>
      <p>But after Ka’imi Fairbairn’s 35-yard field goal cut the gap, Watson launched one into the end zone where Hopkins hauled it in for the game-winning score.</p>
      <p>Watson finished the night 19-of-30 for 298 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. Six of those catches went to Hopkins, who had 94 yards, while Will Fuller had seven catches for 140 yards.</p>
