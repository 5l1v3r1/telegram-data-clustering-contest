      <p>MBOMBELA –  The set of five canvasses by Wouter “Ghost” de Witt depicts Santa Claus, Rudolph the Reindeer and two elves.</p>
      <p>“When Jo-Anne Wearne (marketing at Crossing Centre) phoned me with the idea, I immediately started on the pencil sketches,” De Witt said. “I sent my sketches through and she gave me the go-ahead to do them in colour. I think this was one of the easiest jobs I’ve had to do – everything just fell into place.”</p>

      <blockquote>“The banners were initially erected with the idea that we can change them every now and then, and as soon as I saw them I knew we had to do something Christmassy.” she told Lowvelder.</blockquote>
      <p>Wearne goes on to tell the story of the artwork, about Santa Claus who is so busy trying to meet his deadline of delivering gifts that he does not even notice his gift bag has torn open.</p>

      <p>Enter the magical elves, who have to rescue the fallen gifts, and a disgruntled Rudolph that knows they are behind schedule.</p>
