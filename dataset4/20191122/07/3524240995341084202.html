      </p>
      <p>The Police Service Commission is currently groaning under N349.3m judgment debts imposed by various courts for extrajudicial killings, brutality, rights breaches and other professional misconduct by operatives of the Nigeria Police Force.</p>
      <p>Findings by our correspondent on Thursday indicated that the commission was grappling with no fewer than 14 civil cases in different judicial divisions across the country.</p>
      <p>It was learnt that the courts had subsequently placed nearly all the commission’s bank accounts under garnishee proceedings, thus putting the PSC management in a financial quandary.</p>
      <p>This is happening despite the 2014 ruling of the Court of Appeal, Kaduna judicial division, stating that the commission could not be held ”vicariously liable” for the action of the police since it had no operational control over the personnel.</p>
      <p>Investigation revealed that many of the garnishee cases were still pending while a few had been dismissed and the commission discharged of the legal constraint.</p>
      <p>Some of them have, however, been made absolute meaning that the commission had to comply with the court orders by paying the financial awards.</p>
      <p>For instance, the sum of N5m damages awarded against the commission had been made absolute by the court in suit number, FHC/AWK/CS/21, Sunday Iheanacho vs. PSC and others.</p>
      <p>In suit number, FCT/HC/CU/774/10, Mrs Kate Onuneze vs. PSC and others, the commission was yet to settle the N7m damages awarded against it.</p>
      <p>Another judgment debt of N63.5m awarded in favour of Gabriel Akor in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/553/2017 had also yet to be liquidated.</p>
      <p>While awarding N3m damages against the Inspector-General of Police in 2014 in a case of wrongful detention brought before the Court of Appeal in Kaduna by the appellant, Bashir Nuhu, Justice Uwani Aji had ruled that the Police Service Commission should not be held responsible for the failings of the force.</p>
      <p>He stated, “By Section 215 (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2011, as amended, the control element of the work of the police, their day-to-day field operations and the manner by which they do it reside with the Inspector-General of Police.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing recondite to develop in this law concerning the non-vicarious liability of the fourth respondent (Police Service Commission) to the illegal acts of the Nigeria Police officers. This has been developed by the courts.”</p>
      <p>The PSC spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, said the judgment debts had affected the operations of the commission, adding that the management was working towards addressing the challenge.</p>
