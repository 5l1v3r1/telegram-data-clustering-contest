      <h1>Northern Ireland will play Euro 2020 games in Dublin if they qualify</h1>

        <b>UEFA have confirmed that Northern Ireland will play two games at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin if they reach the European Championship finals.Â </b>
      </p>
      <p>Northern Ireland have been placed in path B of the playoffs, in a quartet alongside the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia and Bosnia.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland will travel to Bosnia for their semi-final, on Thursday March 26th 2020. That's the same night the Republic of Ireland go to Slovakia.</p>
      <p>So the prospect of an All-Ireland final to determine who qualifies for Euro 2020 is on the cards. Home advantage for the playoff final will be determined on Friday.</p>
      <p>It is therefore possible that Northern Ireland could play in Dublin at the Republic of Ireland's expense.</p>
      <p>Spain are already guaranteed to be in Group E for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The other members of the Group will be one of: France / Poland / Switzerland and Croatia.</p>
      <p>And from another tier, one of: Portugal / Turkey / Austria / Sweden and the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>One of the matches for the Republic of Ireland or the North, should they qualify, will be held in Bilbao.</p>
      <p>Michael O'Neill is to remain with Northern Ireland for the playoffs, despite his day to day role as the new manager of Stoke City.</p>
