      <h1>Sri Kartikeya Gana Sabha annual concert series: A melange of musical talents</h1>
      <h2>Sri Kartikeya Gana Sabha’s tenth annual music festival celebrated the diversity of the vocalists and instrumentalists across the country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:11:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Srivathsan-Nadadhur-241/" target="_blank">Srivathsan Nadadhur</a></address>
      <p>Commemorating its tenth year in fostering promising and established classical musical talents in the Telugu states, Sri Kartikeya Gana Sabha had organised an annual concert series and lec-dems over a five-day span at Kowtha Swarajya Vihar earlier this week. While the lec-dems enlightened the rasikas with the finer nuances of the ragams, the innate poetry, vaggeyakara lakshanas that embellish a composition, the concert lineup featured a distinct mix of instrumentalists and vocalists from various parts of the country.</p>

      <p>This year saw the sabha confer the title ‘Naada Tejo Nidhi’ upon ace violinist Annavarapu Ramaswamy.</p>
      <h3>Synergy between performers</h3>
      <p>Incidentally, it was his disciples A Durga Bhavani and Hemadri Chandrakanth who opened the first day of the concert with impressive enthusiasm. In a rare violin duet organised in the city, the performers exhibited terrific coordination for a concert that lasted a little more than an hour. In spite of sticking to familiar compositions, the duo proved that the scope for improvisation could be limitless, especially with <i>Vatapi Ganapatim Bhaje</i> and <i>Teliyaleru Rama</i> in Hamsadhwani and Dhenuka ragam respectively. Their brief raga sketches were deeply reflective, whereas the brisk swarakalpanas at the higher tempos (especially during the charanam of <i>Vatapi</i>) backed by their swift bowing, would have certainly done their guru proud.</p>
      <p>Their main piece, <i>Saroja Dalanetri</i> in Sankarabharanam, preceded by a sublime ragalapana, had the violinists explore the ragam that’s best suited for manodharma sangeetham. Their swarakalpana was a ragamalika, traversing past Kaanada, Kapi, Bindumalini and Hamir Kalyani ragams imaginatively. The synergy between the violin duo, their co-musicians K Sadgurucharan (mridangam) and Srirangam Hari Kishore (kanjira) lent an additional flourish to the well-known numbers.</p>
      <h3>Vocal flexibility to the fore</h3>

      <p>Regardless of musical knowledge, only a handful of vocalists have the knack to bring an effortlessness to their renditions. Chennai-based A S Murali, trusting the intrinsic beauty of the compositions, breezed past the complex gamakas, his swara prasthaaras, neraval segments with envious ease on day two of the concert series. His still-faced demeanour was an antithesis to his bhava-laden singing. The choice to open with <i>Inta Paraaka</i> in Nadanamakriya ragam, by Anai Ayya brothers, a nearly forgotten vaggeyakara-duo was a pleasant surprise.</p>
      <p>His performance to Panchanada Iyer’s rare kriti <i>Birana Brova</i> was a testimony to the musical expanse that the singer could surpass. The neraval Nee Pada Pankajamu in the latter was followed by a swarakalpana where he alternated between the vilamba and durita kala tempos with impressive precision. Tyagaraja’s <i>Rama Neeyada </i>in Kharaharapriya ragam, his main piece was as illustrious and the likes of <i>Nakelara Vicharamu, Endundi Vedalithivo </i>by the same composer sustained the vocalist’s momentum. Veteran musicians BS Narayanan on the violin, V Kamalakar Rao on the mridangam in many a moment even outshined the vocalist, with their mellifluous musical responses.</p>
