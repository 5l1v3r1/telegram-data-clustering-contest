        <b>SPG row reaches Parliament</b>
      </p>
      <p>Recently, the Centre withdrew the SPG protection cover granted to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/restore-spg-cover-for-gandhis-congress-asks-govt-after-uproar-in-rajya-sabha-1620764-2019-11-20"> issue rocked the first four days of the ongoing Winter Session as the Congress</a> upped its ante against the Narendra Modi government and alleged political vendetta.</p>
      <p>In the Parliament, Congress demanded the restoration of the SPG cover to the Gandhi family and former prime minister Manmohan Singh and asked the government to "rise above partisan politics".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gandhis without SPG cover after 28 years</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gandhi family is now without SPG protection after 28 years. They were included in the VVIP security list following an amendment in September 1991 in the SPG Act of 1988.</p>
      <p>The SPG Act was initially supposed to provide security to only the prime minister and former prime ministers of the country</p>
      <p>SPG protectees, under the rules, are provided with guards, hi-tech vehicles, jammers and an ambulance in their cavalcade. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now the only person being protected by the elite SPG commandos.</p>
