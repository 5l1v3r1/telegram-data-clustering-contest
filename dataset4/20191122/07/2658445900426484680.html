      <p>A SECURITY guard and a five-year-old girl have been reportedly killed after gunmen stormed a branch of a Bank in Oye-Ekiti, the headquarters of Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State, yesterday, carting away undisclosed sums of money.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the eight-member robbery gang stormed the bank around 3:17pm in two vehicles.</p>
      <p>The robbers were said to have entered the bank by blowing up the security door with dynamite.</p>
      <p>According to a source, the heavily armed robbers shot into the air to scare away residents within the vicinity of the bank in order to allow them to operate freely, as people scampered for safety.</p>
      <p>Scores of customers and bank officials were reportedly left with various degrees of injuries.</p>
      <p>The security guard and the five-year-old girl whose mother’s shop was beside the bank were killed by stray bullets as the robbers fled.</p>
      <p>The operation lasted for some minutes before the criminals were said to have escaped through the back door of the bank.</p>
      <p>It was also gathered that a police van which was hijacked and used to barricade the highway by the robbers was set ablaze after the operation.</p>
