        <b>"I just think we live in a time with toxic division."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scooter Braun has discussed his feud with <a href="http://nme.com/artists/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift,</a> describing the pair’s rift as a “toxic division”.</p>
      <p>The pair had a public falling out in June this year when Braun purchased Big Machine Records, which owned all of Taylor’s back catalogue of songs.</p>
      <p>She subsequently alleged that she wasn’t allowed to buy the masters of her record, before claiming last week that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-responds-truth-big-machine-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-fall-out-2568474">she had been “banned” from performing her older hits</a> at the upcoming American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t talked about this in six months, not once. I haven’t made a statement about it and that’s hard, because when you have a lot of things being said and a lot of different opinions — yet the principals haven’t had a chance to speak to each other — there’s a lot of confusion,” Braun said at a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce conference.</p>
      <p>“I think that I’m not gonna go into details here because it’s just not my style.</p>
      <p>He added: “I just think we live in a time with toxic division and people thinking that social media is the appropriate place to air out on each other and not have conversations.</p>

      <p>Taylor Swift, live</p>
      <p>“I don’t like politicians doing it, I don’t like anybody doing it, and if that means that I gotta be the bad guy longer, I’ll be the bad guy longer. But I’m not gonna participate.”</p>
      <p>Braun didn’t mention Swift by name, but seemingly suggested that he would rather sort their feud privately.</p>
      <p>He  said: “What I’ll say is, people need to communicate and when people are able to communicate I think they work things out.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of times things are miscommunicated, but I believe that people are fundamentally good. ‘I also think there are a lot of real problems in the world, and I think that these problems that are being discussed can be discussed behind closed doors and figured out pretty easily.</p>
      <p>“It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for six months and it’s hard because I can handle it pretty easily.”</p>
      <p>In a bid to reclaim control of her music, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-says-she-plans-to-re-record-material-after-losing-the-rights-to-her-songs-to-scooter-braun-2540568">Swift previously stated that she planned to re-record her songs from the first six records</a>.</p>
