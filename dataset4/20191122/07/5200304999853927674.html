      <h1>Shah Rukh Khan to juggle between Rajkumar Hirani &amp; Atlee?</h1>

      <p>Shah Rukh Khan may currently be on a hiatus, but he planning to come back strong with two films shooting back-to-back. While he has discussed booking off March for Atlee’s film, Khan is also in talks with Rajkumar Hirani for his upcoming project.</p>
      <p>“It is pucca (confirmed). Shah Rukh has said yes to Hirani, and they are working out dates in April. It is not clear whether SRK will first shoot with Atlee and then shoot with Hirani, or the other way around,” an industry source told <i>Deccan Chronicle.</i></p>
      <p>Both filmmakers are ecstatic to work with Khan, but his silence is also causing anxiety. “It is actually very stressful for the people around the filmmakers to hold their excitement until Shah Rukh decides to make the announcement. Though he has verbally confirmed doing both the projects, he has not made it official. This is why everyone is putting out as many details out as possible, as they feel they might just miss the bus,” the source shared.</p>
      <p>Apart from these films, Khan has also shot a cameo for Ayan Mukerji’s ‘Brahmastra’.</p>
