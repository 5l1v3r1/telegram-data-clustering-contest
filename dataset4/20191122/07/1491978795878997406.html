        <i>Forget IV drips and fancy supplements. An all-day breakfast costs only £5 and is easily accessible</i>
      </p>
      <p>A lot of money and imagination has been expended on finding the perfect hangover cure: IV drips; glutathione supplements; smearing oneself in mint. Anecdotal experience vies with professional advice: “hair of the dog (drinking more alcohol) does not help”, the NHS website states definitively. (I imagine this said with a chastising furrowing of the brow.)</p>
      <p>Really, we all know the perfect hangover cure. It doesn’t involve anything intravenous, costs £5 and is easily accessible: The Full English Breakfast. Or perhaps more accurately, the All Day <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/breakfast">Breakfast</a> (affectionately abbreviated to ADB) because any breakfast that isn’t served after 11am is hardly better than useless. What if one only crawled into bed at 9am?</p>
      <p>However it appears on the menu, the breakfast has to abide by certain edicts. It must be hearty. It must have a revitalising slow rise of steam – like thermal springs in Nordic countries – but not be so hot as to be mouth-burning. It must be some combination of eggs, beans, hash browns (<i>non-negotiable</i>), toast, and for the non-vegetarians, sausages, bacon. Not black pudding, which should be illegal (I have a petition; I’ll send you the link).</p>
      <p>Some eateries have introduced “artisan” options, which often include avocado (it has the texture of the final sliver of a bar of soap: you’re all mad). Sometimes halloumi and spinach are involved, which I will allow. But the basics are best. Beans should be overflowing to the point of almost dribbling down one’s shirtsleeves; the excess mopped up with toast. Butter should be served warm, so it melts into the bread as liquid gold. It should not come as cold as a mortuary slab.</p>
      <p>Breakfasts should be advertised on a plastic swinging board, blocking half the pavement, outside a traditional greasy spoon. They should not be served on a slice of wood. The price should be rounded to the whole pound. Five pounds, or six, or seven, but never £6.65. This is not in the spirit of the hangover breakfast, when one is fishing out change from a pocket of jeans just thrown on and basic mathematics is beyond a still gin-soaked brain.</p>
      <p>The hangover breakfast comes with a risk. An unsettled stomach can creep on. The face becomes clammy, while the triangles of toast transform into unclimbable peaks. I recommend sips of builders’ tea, rather than the heart-shaking addition of coffee. And water, lots of it. If all goes according to plan, the hangover breakfast is a reversal of a day’s fortunes. Just hold the black pudding.</p>
