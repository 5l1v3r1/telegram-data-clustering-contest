      <h1>Colts can’t get passing game going against Texans</h1>

      <p>HOUSTON — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jacoby-brissett-player-stats">Jacoby Brissett</a> and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/indianapolis-colts-team">Indianapolis Colts</a> couldn’t get their passing game going on Thursday night against the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/houston-texans-team">Houston Texans</a>, and it cost them a win and the top spot in the AFC South.</p>
      <p>Brissett managed just 129 yards passing as the Texans (7-4) got a 20-17 victory to move into first place in the division.</p>
      <p>“We just weren’t clicking, we just weren’t clicking in the passing game as well,” coach Frank Reich said. “We made a few plays, but not enough.”</p>
      <p>The Texans trailed by four early in the fourth quarter when <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/deandre-hopkins-player-stats">DeAndre Hopkins</a> got in front of <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/pierre-desir-player-stats">Pierre Desir</a> and stretched out to haul in a 30-yard reception to take a 20-17 lead.</p>
      <p>Houston’s defense stepped up after that, forcing a punt on the next drive before stopping the Colts (6-5) on fourth-and-7 with three minutes left. Brissett came up a yard shy of a first down on Indy’s fourth-down attempt late in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>“I felt like everybody was covered at the time I made my decision to take off and run,” he said. “They’re playing a coverage where they’re trying to force me to run. I thought I had a chance of getting it and the guy made a good play.”</p>
      <p>While the Colts were certainly disappointed in the loss, Reich tried to stress to his team to stay positive with five games left and the division race so close.</p>
      <p>“There’s still plenty of football left, and we’re far from out of this thing,” he said. “This was a playoff atmosphere. Obviously, it was a good opportunity for us to take sole possession and have a sweep of Houston, but it didn’t work out that way.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/ty-hilton-player-stats">T.Y. Hilton</a> had topped 100 yards receiving in four of his last six games against the Texans and entered averaging 133.3 yards receiving in seven career games at NRG Stadium. He wasn’t a factor, finishing with just 18 yards receiving in his return after missing three games with a calf injury.</p>
      <p>“He was on a pitch count,” Reich said. “They had told me 20-30 snaps would be the recommended snap count. He was feeling a little bit tight, from what they told me. But give him credit because he wanted to get in there. Some of it was as a decoy so that was part of the plan.”</p>
      <p>But Hilton refused to use his health or lack of practice time as an excuse for his poor game and lamented failing to make a couple of catches that would have extended drives.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I get paid for,” he said. “I let my team down today, 100 percent. I’ve got to get better.”</p>
      <p>There were about six minutes left in the third quarter when Jonathan Williams, who helped fill in for injured starter <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/marlon-mack-player-stats">Marlon Mack</a>, wriggled away from three defenders and dashed 13 yards for a touchdown to put the Colts up 17-10.</p>
      <p>“It was crazy to come off there, you throw for 175 yards, you’re 60 percent on third down and 2 for 3 in the red zone, you just feel like you should win that game,” Reich said. “But what we lacked was big plays on offense.”</p>
      <p>Will Fuller had a 51-yard reception on the first play of Houston’s next drive, but the Texans couldn’t move the ball after that and settled for a 36-yard field goal to cut the lead to four.</p>
      <p>The Texans led 3-0 after a field goal early in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>There were about eight minutes left in the second when Kenny Moore tipped a pass from Watson and intercepted it. It was the first time Watson had thrown an interception at home since Oct. 14, 2018, against the Bills, a streak of 303 attempts which was the longest active run in the NFL.</p>
      <p>The Colts cashed in on the mistake when Brissett scrambled 5 yards for a touchdown to make it 7-3.</p>
      <p>There were two minutes left in the first half when Watson avoided the rush and found Hopkins wide open in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown pass to put Houston back on top 10-7.</p>
      <p>Indianapolis added a field goal at the end of the first half to leave it tied at 10-10 at halftime.</p>
