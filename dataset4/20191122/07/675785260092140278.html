      <h1>Mason Mount recounts Jose Mourinho advice that will always stay with him</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea youngster has made a big impression on the pitch this season, but he used to be a regular on the sidelines at Stamford Bridge in Mourinho's days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:39:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham's ball boys could be in for a shock following the appointment of Jose Mourinho as manager, according to Chelsea's Mason Mount.</p>
      <p>Mourinho signed a three-and-a-half year deal to become the new Spurs boss on Wednesday morning, replacing Mauricio Pochettino in the hotseat.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese will begin what is his fourth different spell in English football with a trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday lunchtime, and Mount was around for a close look at the third.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old used to act as a ball boy at Stamford Bridge for Blues home games when he was in the club's academy, and he told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> website about a piece of advice Mourinho - who was then in his second spell at the club - used to give him.</p>

      <p>"The first thing I really remember was being a ball boy at the games," he told <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/21/mason-mount-reveals-the-trick-jose-mourinho-told-him-when-he-was">the Blues website</a> .</p>
      <p>"That was a big thing for me. I was so buzzing about that and you can’t really be any closer than that!</p>
      <p>"One moment that stands out was under Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"If we were winning in Champions League games then he would tell us to keep hold of the ball and not to throw it back so quickly!"</p>
      <p>Mourinho will return to the Champions League with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> when the North Londoners host Olympiakos on Tuesday, but before that he'll make his bow at West Ham on Saturday lunchtime.</p>

      <p>“I had a feeling I was going to get a club mid-season," he said at his press conference unveiling on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I knew I would be in a situation where I would get only one or two days before my first game. I cannot come here and think it is about myself. It is about the players and going from a base of stability.”</p>
