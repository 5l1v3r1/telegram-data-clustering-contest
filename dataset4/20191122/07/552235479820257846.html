      <p>Hamilton fighter Kevin Duris has upped his game as he targets a British title next year.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old is part of FSG promotions’ Fight Night: Battle of Britain event at the Alona Hotel in Motherwell on Saturday, which all going well will act as an eliminator for a British title fight in March.</p>
      <p>Duris has been plagued by injuries in recent months, but is sparring with professionals as he tries to give himself the best possible chance.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve had a few injuries, with my shoulder and broke my ankle, so I’m just getting back.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait to get back in there, and hopefully this sets me up for a title fight in March.</p>
      <p>“A British title fight would be massive, and I’m going well just now, I’m well prepared for it, and I’m sparring with professionals and holding my own.</p>
      <p>“That’s quite a big boost, because some of the guys are a bit heavier than me, but I’m doing well, so it’s all about trying to better yourself.</p>
      <p>“I’m also doing a bit of pad work and sparring at Fighting Scots Gym with Francis Gilluley.”</p>
      <p>Francis is promoting the night on Saturday, which will also feature Blantyre’s Andrew McGee and Bellshill trio Aaron Caldwell, Kris Wilson and William Strachan, on top of junior exhibition bouts, which will showcase some of the top young talent in the area.</p>
      <p>Kevin expects a good home crowd and said: “I have a good following, and always have a lot of boys, family and stuff in the audience for my fights – it helps a lot.”</p>
      <p>For tickets, contact Francis on 07767 636366.</p>
