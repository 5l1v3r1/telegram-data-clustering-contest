      <h1>Bon Iver Drops First Official Music Video in Seven Years for "Naeem"</h1>
      <h2>A cut off their Grammy-nominated album ‘i,i.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:03:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Caraan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/bon-iver">Bon Iver</a> has shared a visual for “Naeem,” the midpoint of their latest album <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/bon-ivers-i-i-album-stream">i,i</a></i> and the band’s first official, non-lyric music video since “Beth/Rest” in 2012. Helmed by Barcelona-born and Los Angeles-based director AG Rojas (<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/earl-sweatshirt">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kamasi-washington">Kamasi Washington</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/florence-the-machine">Florence + The Machine</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/run-the-jewels">Run The Jewels</a>), the music video is a reflection of the unspoken trauma being carried over generation after generation.</p>
      <p>“Naeem is concerned with the potential for intergenerational healing, and how we choose to engage with that potential,” Rojas said. “All my admiration and love to Cynthia Rodriguez and her child Azul who brought this idea to life, and to Bon Iver for amplifying it.”</p>
      <p><i>i,i</i> was <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/grammy-nominations-2020-full-list">recently nominated</a> for four <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/grammys">Grammys</a> including Album of the Year, Record of the Year for “Hey, Ma,” Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package. This totals Bon Iver’s Grammy nominations to seven, winning two in 2012 for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album.</p>
