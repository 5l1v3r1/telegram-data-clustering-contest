      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The National Immigration Agency (NIA) is preparing to send a man home to Japan who overstayed his visa by 36 years while living in the Hualien County countryside.</p>
      <p>The 82-year-old, surnamed Hori (堀), had been living in a modest dwelling up on a hill in Fuli, in the far south of Hualien County, the Central News Agency reported.</p>
      <p>His presence came to light after a resident reported an elderly man had been living in poverty, and local police visited him. They found he had entered Taiwan in 1983 on a tourist visa and had never left or applied for a residency permit.</p>
      <p>As he could not speak Chinese, Hori reportedly explained in broken English how he had launched a mining venture which went wrong, and stayed in Taiwan doing odd jobs afterward.</p>
      <p>He had even forgotten where in Japan he was from and had lost all contact with his relatives there, according to CNA.</p>
      <p>Hori had been unable to find enough money for a flight back, but the NIA was preparing to send him to Japan.</p>
