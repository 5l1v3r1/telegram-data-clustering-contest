      <p>Special prosecutors have filed a new charge against a woman suspected of conspiring with relatives in the alleged honor killings in Texas of her estranged sister’s American husband and a friend, who was an Iranian rights activist.<br/><br/>The authorities on November 20 charged 35-year-old Nadia Irsan with conspiring with her father, stepmother, and brother in a plan that led to the 2012 fatal shootings in the Houston area.<br/><br/>Irsan had previously been charged with stalking related to the killings of Nesreen Irsan’s 28-year-old husband, Coty Beavers, and her friend Gelareh Bagherzadeh, 30.<br/><br/>Irsan's public defender, Eric Davis, said he will fight the charges in court.<br/><br/>Nadia Irsan is one of two people with open cases tied to the killings, which occurred after Nesreen Irsan left the family's rural compound and converted from Islam to Christianity.<br/><br/>Irsan’s father Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, a Jordanian immigrant and conservative Muslim, was sentenced to death in 2018 for the two killings.<br/><br/>Testimony in the trial of Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan indicated Bagherzadeh was targeted in January 2012 because she helped Nesreen Irsan convert to Christianity.<br/><br/>Police said Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, his wife, and son Nasim Isran followed Bagherzadeh to her parents' home, and that the son shot her while she was in her car.<br/><br/>Nasim Isran is awaiting trial on a capital murder charge.<br/><br/>The indictment appeared to end speculation that the Iranian government was involved in the murder of Bagherzadeh, who spoke out publicly against Tehran's repressive tactics after leaving Iran in 2008.</p>
