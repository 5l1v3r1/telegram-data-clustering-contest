      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/john-discala/when-is-best-time-to-buy-airline-tickets-for-business-travel.html">Air travel is getting more expensive</a> while the perks (<a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/american-airlines-flight-attendant-union-representative-calls-airline-seats-a-torture-chamber.html">like, a comfortable seat</a>) are becoming less common. If you own a business, though, then there are ways to even out the loss and actually make the most of each flight you take.</p>
      <h3>Sign up for business miles</h3>
      <p>The three major carriers - American, Delta and United - have the basic frequent flyer miles. Those are free to earn and just require that you sign up. You can rack up miles to trade them in for free flights, seat upgrades and other details.</p>
      <p>However, they all offer a separate business frequent flyer points: <a href="http://www.businessextra.com/">American Airlines Business Extra</a>, <a href="https://skybonus.delta.com/">Delta SkyBonus</a> and <a href="https://unitedperksplus.united.com/">United Perks Plus</a>. After you confirm you are a business owner, these free programs will give you an entirely different set of frequent flyer points per flight. They can be turned in for flights, lounge access and other perks, and, most importantly, you still collect your normal frequent flyer points, too. Just read the fine print to make sure your business qualifies.</p>
      <h3>Buy one leg at a time</h3>
      <p>Believe it or not, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/one-way-tickets-cheaper-than-round-trip">round trips are now sometimes more expensive</a> than buying two one-way tickets. What does this mean? First, it means you can price compare per leg rather than having to just settle for a total flight price of your entire trip. Second, you don't have to stay committed to one airline: Fly the more reasonably priced one there, then fly the more reasonably priced one back, knowing that they don't have to be the same airline.</p>
      <h3>Consider first class</h3>
      <p>It's odd, but true: Sometimes higher class seats are equal to, if not cheaper than coach. The first time I flew first class, I was heading to a wedding on a tight budget and needed to fly cross-country. I pulled up the seat comparison chart and the first class seat was actually a few dollars cheaper than the budget seat. I had an excellent transcontinental trip.</p>
      <p>It may be against instinct, but take a moment to look at all the seat options before you buy a ticket. You may get lucky and have a first-class experience on a coach-class expense.</p>
