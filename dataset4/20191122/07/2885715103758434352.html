      <h2>Over 110 teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University have signed a statement on Thursday disassociating themselves from the teachers' association of the institute.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:44:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Over 110 teachers of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/?s=Jawaharlal+Nehru+University">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> signed a statement on Thursday disassociating themselves from the teachers’ association of the institute owing to the group’s “indifference” towards alleged attacks on their colleagues by some protesting students.</p>
      <p>The teachers also said the formation of the high-powered committee by the HRD Ministry to resolve the impasse over the hike in hostel fees amounts to “interference” in the matters of an autonomous university.</p>
      <p>JNU Teachers’ Association President D K Lobiyal, however, said they have not received any communication about some teachers disassociating themselves from the group.</p>
      <p>In a press conference, the section of teachers accused JNUTA of “supporting, instigating and using students”, and at the same time expressed solidarity with the protesters and hoped that the issue of hostel fee hike is resolved amicably.</p>
      <p>“We have decided to dissociate ourselves from JNUTA from November 20. The primary reason behind this decision is the shocking indifference of the present office bearers of JNUTA to a series of dastardly attacks on teachers in last one month,” they said and accused the JNUTA of being “hand in glove” with the miscreants in “attacking, abusing, confining and intimidating own colleagues”.</p>
      <p>Their statement came in the wake of Professor Vandana Mishra, an associate dean of the varsity, allegedly being confined to over 24 hours in a classroom by students protesting over the hostel manual.</p>
      <p>They also alleged that the protesting students have targeted the family members of faculty members.</p>
