      <p>In the last part of our End of Decade series, Mark Douglas takes a look at ten things we believe will happen in the next decade.</p>
      <p>We have been looking back at what the 2010s held for the club but here we gaze into the crystal ball and consider what the next ten years might have to offer.</p>
      <h3>A new owner – or the ownership issue to continue at least</h3>
      <p>Mike Ashley cast the longest shadow over the last decade at St James’ Park and if he remains for another ten years, he will do the same again for Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>The fact is that for many, as long as Ashley remains the owner there is no relationship. And for thousands more who still go, the damage done by Ashley in the last decade means the ties that should bind have become extremely strained. It feels almost impossible for Newcastle to progress without the handbrake on as long as Ashley remains.</p>
      <p>Of course, the club can move forward with the current owner if they do things right – 2011 and the fifth placed finish proves that’s possible – but sustained success, excellence or an engaged fanbase? It seems unlikely for so many of the reasons we’ve spent the last few years debating.</p>

      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>So I suspect many of the weeks, months and years that follow the advent of the new decade will be spent debating whether Ashley will be here on January 1, 2030. The man himself said his attitude now was that he would be the owner “forever” but plenty can change in 10 years and Newcastle remain a lure for many would-be investors.</p>
      <p>A personal belief is that he WILL sell up over the next decade. He’s been close in the last ten years – <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-takeover-kenyon-16990258">my information is that he really did believe Peter Kenyon was about to buy United last year, having spent almost £1million on legal fees to do his part</a> – and if someone can come up with a deal that assures him a profit he will walk away. But would I bet on it? Not necessarily, given that he gets plenty out of his ownership and doesn’t look like a motivated seller at the moment.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t feel close but over the last ten years there have been credible bidders and there will be more in the next decade. That will only be the start of the fun, with the next owner’s credentials just as keenly scrutinised.</p>
      <p>It is the biggest and most important issue at the club.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>New sponsorship opportunities</h3>
      <p>Commercial income is key at Newcastle and this summer sees United renewing their main sponsor as FUN88’s two year deal has expired. It’ll be a big test of the club’s appeal as they look at emerging markets – including the Middle East and China – for new commercial partners.</p>
      <p>Newcastle could also be looking at a new kit manufacturer this summer, although the more eagle-eyed supporters noted in</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gallery/revealed-amazing-46-page-brochure-16990274">the infamous Peter Kenyon brochure it listed Puma’s deal as having further years to run</a>
      </p>
      <p>. All parties are remaining tight-lipped on that one and it could well be that the German sportswear giant – handed the contract after Adidas were dropped by Ashley – are back on board for the 2020/21 season.</p>

      <h3>The 2021 revolution</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/115million-question-could-change-direction-17285627">Newcastle have 20 players in the first team squad out of contract in the next 18 months</a> , but it is the summer of 2021 that should really focus minds.</p>
      <p>United have around £80million worth of talent whose contracts are due to expire, with Matt Ritchie, Jonjo Shelvey, Ciaran Clark, Dwight Gayle and Isaac Hayden among the players who would potentially be free agents in that summer. That is a daunting to do list or a massive opportunity to change depending on how you look at it.</p>
      <p>In 2011 they oversaw a radical overhaul that saw Kevin Nolan and Joey Barton go the journey. But the next 18 months could see an unprecedented evolution because Newcastle will inevitably let some of their established first teamers go.</p>
      <p>If Newcastle are still in the Premier League this summer, we can expect a very busy close season of comings and goings as United re-assess the foundations of their first team squad.</p>
      <h3>A club at a crossroads</h3>
      <p>The 2010s were the decade that disappointed. After dropping back as Ashley made the first set of damaging mistakes, Newcastle were poised in 2012 to reclaim some of their former glory but took the wrong decisions and within a year of their fifth-placed finish they were appointing Joe Kinnear and the club’s Chief Scout Graham Carr was being informed of it in a Middlesex pub.</p>
      <p>Newcastle have to be better in the 2020s, whoever is in charge. Because it is absolutely critical that they remain a part of the Premier League elite at a time when a new TV deal and a new European competition are effectively increasing the gap between the top flights haves and have nots.</p>
      <p>Newcastle insiders feel this is a season of transition. What they do next – and it says a lot that so few have faith in them – is going to be crucial. Their place at the top table is not assured: just ask the fallen giants in the Championship or below who are struggling to get back.</p>
      <h3>The rise of the Longstaffs – one way or another</h3>
      <p>Newcastle have a pair of diamonds in the Longstaff brothers – but they need to be polished by the club. Their eye-catching debuts confirm their raw promise but there is work to do to ensure that both fulfil their potential, with Sean’s injury proof that they need to be looked after.</p>
      <p>In the 2020s, one (or maybe both) will play for England and we must hope that unlike Andy Carroll or Michael Carrick, this pair can flourish while they are still at Newcastle. It would be a crying shame if one or both do their best work away from Tyneside.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Spending money – if the team stay in the Premier League</h3>
      <p>A little know fact: if Newcastle had stayed up under Rafa Benitez in 2015 the club would have been a very different place. There’d have been more money to spend in the summer and United could have built on sound foundations rather than rebuilt from a position of weakness.</p>
      <p>The reason for that? United reckon they had cleared their financial obligations and, thanks to the TV money, could afford to invest every summer. The noises from the club this summer are that they are in that position again now, two years after promotion. A spend of £60million – factor in fees with that – is available every summer so long as they don’t go down.</p>
      <p>So we can expect more signings if they continue to retain their top flight status, with the mantra now: adding quality, not quantity.</p>

      <h3>Stadium issues</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/strawberry-place-st-james-park-17072706">After the Strawberry Place saga</a> appeared to confirm the belief of Newcastle’s current hierarchy that they do not need to expand the ground or redevelop it much past the sort of work done this summer (improved corporate facilities and facades). But this could be the decade when that comes to a head.</p>
      <p>If new owners arrive with big plans – and that’s a big if – they will no doubt commission studies into what can be done to extend and expand the stadium. Could that eventually lead the club out of the town? Somewhere down the line, that is the sort of discussion the club may end up having.</p>
      <p>It feels like what happened with Strawberry Place might just have ensured that day will arrive.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Apathy - or protests</h3>
      <p>If things don’t change, the 4,000 or so who have given up their tickets this season is surely only going to increase. Ten year season ticket deals will start to expire in this decade and with prices having gone up since then, could more walk away?</p>
      <p>The club needs to do something to win them back.</p>
      <p>For many it won’t make a difference. They have lost the faith of a fair few and the lack of hope among many of the supporter base is a major worry. Anger caused the initial decision to walk away; apathy has taken over since.</p>
      <p>If Ashley doesn’t go, a disaffected fanbase is going to become a major problem.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>A new training ground</h3>
      <p>A major bugbear for many supporters. As other clubs invest in facilities, Newcastle have mothballed plans hatched during the 2010s to improve their training ground.</p>
      <p>Even under the current hierarchy, that will likely during the course of the decade. Lee Charnley said in his most recent interview the club do intend to invest in that and if they end the 2020s in the same facility it will be deeply concerning.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article16192317.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_training.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Artist's impressions of what Newcastle United's training ground would look like after plans were put together for a £10m upgrade in 2013.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>A Cup run</h3>
      <p>During the whole 2010s, Newcastle got no further than the fourth round of the FA Cup or the quarter-finals of the League Cup. There was a single European campaign that saw them reach the last eight of the Europa League but still, that is frankly pathetic.</p>
      <p>By law of averages, United must do deeper in one of the two domestic Cup comeptitions in the next decade. All eyes on next Monday’s Cup draw with Steve Bruce under a measure of pressure to deliver a more coherent FA Cup plan that his predecessors.</p>
