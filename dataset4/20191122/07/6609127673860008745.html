        <b>ANN BUDGE faces a battle to land Daniel Stendel as Hearts boss — because the German would rather stay in England.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Barnsley manager Stendel is the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Jambos</a>’ No 1 choice to replace Craig Levein, as SunSport revealed yesterday.</p>

      <p>But Tynecastle chief Budge will have to pull out all the stops to persuade the 45-year-old that his future lies in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Sources close to bookies’ favourite Stendel have indicated he’d rather stay down south than head north.</p>
      <p>Stendel led the Tykes to promotion from League One back in May following his first full season in charge of the Yorkshire side.</p>
      <p>But he was controversially sacked last month with the club sitting 23rd in the English Championship.</p>

      <p>And despite the lowly league position it proved a hugely unpopular decision with the club’s fan base.</p>
      <p>Stendel is now determined to restore his reputation at another club in England and is prepared to wait for the right offer to come along.</p>
      <p>Unless the Jambos can persuade him to change his mind he is set to remain on gardening leave from Barnsley until the end of his contract in June.</p>
      <p>That would be a major blow to the Gorgie club as they continue to search for Levein’s successor.</p>
      <p>They have spoken to a vast number of candidates about the vacant post, including Stuart McCall, Jack Ross, Steve Cotterrill and Neil McCann.</p>
      <p>In the meantime interim manager Austin MacPhee — who has not given up hope of landing the job himself — will continue to take the team at Kilmarnock tomorrow.</p>
      <p>It will be MacPhee’s second game in charge following the 5-2 win over St Mirren ahead of the international break.</p>
      <p>And another win would enhance his own chances of persuading Budge to hand him the reins on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>MacPhee was able to welcome back defender Craig Halkett to training on Wednesday ahead of the trip to Rugby Park.</p>
      <p>But SunSport understands the trip to Ayrshire will come too soon for the defender as he makes his way back from a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old is instead expected to make his comeback when the men in maroon visit Rangers a week on Sunday.</p>
      <p>And in a further boost for MacPhee midfielder Peter Haring is also hopeful of returning to action before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The Austrian has missed the whole of this season with a pelvic problem dating back to before last season’s Scottish Cup final with Celtic.</p>
      <p>But he is now nearing a top-team return ahead of a hectic December for the Tynecastle side.</p>
