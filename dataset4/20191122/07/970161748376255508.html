      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> is gearing up for the release of its twelfth series and a new teaser image promises it will have ‘space for all’.</p>
      <p>This will be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jodie-whittaker/">Jodie Whittaker</a>’s second run in charge of the Tardis as the Thirteenth Doctor.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, the BBC America account tweeted out the newest teaser image for the new instalment, which sees the Doctor reunited with her three companions Graham (Bradley Walsh), Yaz (Mandip Gill) and Ryan (Toisin Cole).</p>
      <p>The picture teases that the show’s return will have ‘space for all,’ so we’re looking forward to this being the most inclusive and far-reaching part of the long-running sci-fi saga yet.</p>

      <p>It was previously teased that the new series <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/doctor-who-series-12-will-return-with-the-biggest-episode-the-show-has-ever-done-11188497/">will return with the ‘biggest episode the show has ever done.’</a> Considering this is a show about all of time and space, that is a very bold claim to make, but we’re excited.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk at BBC Studios in Cardiff, Chibnall said of their comeback episode: ‘It’s big. It’s the biggest episode we’ve done, and it might be the biggest episode the show has done. Lots of action, a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a big, action-packed hoot.’</p>

      <p>Two very special guests will be joining the show when it re-launches early next year too. British icons <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/doctor-who-series-12-adds-lenny-henry-and-stephen-fry-as-guest-stars-and-it-almost-makes-up-for-no-christmas-special-11189758/">Stephen Fry and Sir Lenny Henry have been announced</a> to join the cast in roles that are being kept a closely guarded secret for now (obviously).</p>
      <p>Stephen has exclaimed how happy he is to be cast the role describing it as a ‘very sweet second-place excitement’.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘Short of being picked for a British space exploration programme and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) – then being in an episode of Doctor Who will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement.’</p>
      <p>We’re also now only<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/doctor-teases-something-big-just-two-weeks-time-11074797/"> one day away from the secret announcement</a> that the show as kept teasing for weeks.</p>
      <p>It will drop on November 23, which is the exact date the first ever episode of the programme aired in 1963.</p>

      <p>Could it be an announcement that the BBC’s flagship drama will drop a new episode sooner than anyone expected? <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/is-doctor-who-going-to-surprise-fans-by-starting-new-series-on-new-years-day-11187055/">Perhaps even on New Years Day</a>?</p>
