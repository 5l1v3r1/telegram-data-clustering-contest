      <p>Representatives from Birmingham’s Irish community stood alongside relatives of the 21 people killed in the city by IRA terrorists as the region’s blackest night was remembered.</p>
      <p>Forty-five years on from the bloodbath in two city centre bars, there was quiet contemplation, sad memories, inevitable tears and, above all, recollections of the victims. If one of the aims of the killers was to turn Brummies against each other, last night bore testament again to their utter failure.</p>

      <p>The murderers caused immeasurable heartache and pain and the surviving bombers remain at liberty, despite repeated pledges by the police that the case is still active. But the bonds between the Irish community and the bereaved are closer, tighter and warmer than ever.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The relatives have the Irish community to thank for the striking new tree memorial, outside Grand Central railway station, the leaves of which are emblazoned with the names of those we lost. And important lessons have been learned about the dangers of rushing to judgement when such disasters strike.</p>

      <p>Julie Hambleton, who lost her sister, Maxine, in the bombings and is spokeswoman for J421, said: “The memorial event is always a very difficult one and, as the years have passed, there are fewer relatives left, although larger numbers of supporters than ever, which always helps us.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“With the inquest into the deaths finally being held earlier this year, I think we have far more clarity than ever about the final moments of our loved ones in 1974, so this year is especially tough.</p>
      <p>“But it is important for this event to be permanently established on <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-pub-bombings">Birmingham’s calendar</a> because it shows that terrorism achieves nothing but pain and harrowing memories for its victims.</p>
      <p>“The attacks were attacks on the city of Birmingham as a whole and the aim was to kill indiscriminately, divide communities and bring about hatred and anger.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The murderers took many lives, but utterly failed in every other respect. The Irish community has been wonderfully supportive of us and we have bonds of friendship that will never be broken. “Our families are, as always humbled from the support from so many people who stand shoulder to shoulder with us every year.</p>
      <p>“We send them our heartfelt thanks. St Philips Cathedral have held a poignant service dedicated to our loved ones. The cathedral has always been our spiritual home.</p>
      <p>“The Misneach Memorial Committee has continued to support our new Tree Memorial,  Thanks also to Maurice Malone and to Grand Central station Manager Craig Stenning, British Transport Police and the Stagebus company who have all provided goods and services. Also All Bar One have provided excellent hospitality once again. “Such generosity and kindness from so many provides us with a light that has been missing in our lives for so long.</p>

      <p>“And, of course, heartfelt thanks to the pupils from Our Lady’s Catholic Primary School who have come out on such a bitter cold evening to share this important moment with us. They are our future and hopefully bringing them into our lives may help to strengthen our community cohesion, which is significant for the future of great city.”</p>
      <p>She also thanked <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jess-phillips">Jess Phillips</a> , who is defending the Birmingham Yardley seat in the general election, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/andy-street">West Midlands Mayor Andy Street</a> and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/benjamin-zephaniah">Benjamin Zephaniah</a> .</p>
