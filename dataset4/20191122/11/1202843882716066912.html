      <p>Qatar’s transport sector reached another key milestone yesterday with Qatar Railways Company (Qatar Rail) launching preview service for the Doha Metro Gold Line, which extends from Ras Bu Abboud in the east, to Al Aziziyah in the west.</p>
      <p>The launch of new service will not only make it convenient to travel to new areas in Doha but will also make their journey affordable. Travellers will be able to complete a one way journey between two stations in Gold and Red Line in just QR2.</p>
      <p>The Gold line preview service covers 11 stations, including Ras Bu Abboud, National Museum, Souq Waqif, Bin Mahmoud, Al Sadd, Joaan, Al Sudan, Al Waab, Sport City, Al Aziziyah and interchange station Msheireb.</p>
      <p>Customers can now travel between the Doha Metro’s Gold and Red Line through Msheireb station. When interchanging between lines, customers are not required to tap in and out as long as they remain within the paid area. All journeys including those requiring an interchange will only cost QR2 in standard and family class, and QR10 in Gold class for one trip.</p>
      <p>“The launch of the Metro preview services has been well received and we’ve had a extremely positive response from our customers. The launch of the Gold Line service is another key milestone for Qatar Rail leading up to the delivery of our fully-fledged integrated network by 2020. In the past few months, we have dedicated our efforts to deliver the expansion of Doha Metro services, and we are ahead of schedule,” Eng. Abdulla Saif Al Sulaiti, Chief of Service Delivery at Qatar Rail.  </p>
      <p>“With the launch of the Gold Line preview service we are expecting customer numbers to increase considerably as we open up more journey opportunities to explore the city; connecting attractions and lifestyle destinations including, National Museum, Souq Waqif, Al Sadd and Sport City,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Gold Line’s operating hours are the same as the Red Line, from 6am to 11pm Saturday to Thursday and from 2pm to 11pm on Fridays, with trains operating every five minutes.</p>
      <p>New metrolink routes will be added by Qatar Rail’s feeder bus service provider Mowasalat, transporting passengers to and from metro stations and surrounding areas. Metro passengers can view available routes using Qatar Rail’s and Mowasalat’s mobile apps or websites. “Qatar Rail will be adding and extending its metrolink routes to new neighborhoods and areas, enabling a seamless journey for customers,” Qatar Rail said in a statement.</p>
      <p> “Our stations carry Doha Metro’s distinct architectural identity, “Vaulted Spaces”, the network’s contemporary design imprint, reflecting regional heritage through open spaces that mimic traditional Bedouin tents. The stations’ interior spaces and floors signifies the color gold,” said the company. Qatar Rail said that all Gold Line stations are now ready to welcome customers. Doha Metro flags have been placed at the entrances of all Gold line stations.</p>
      <p>“Starting of new service is a big relief for me because now I can avoid heavy rush on roads while going to sports city. I will not only save money while travelling on the metro but will also save my time,” Mohammed Fadi told The Peninsula. He was among the persons who used Gold Line service on its launch day.</p>
      <p>Travellers can purchase Travel Cards at metro stations. Pre-loaded Standard Travel Cards can be purchased from licensed retailers including Al Meera, Lulu, Carrefour, Jumbo Electronics, and Family Food Centre. Gold club travel cards are available from dedicated gold club offices at all Metro stations.</p>
