      <h1>This is the Maybach version of the Mercedes-Benz GLS</h1>
      <h2>The ultimate form of SUV luxury according to Mercedes-Maybach</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:02:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw Mercedes-Benz reveal a 600 horsepower family mover called the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/mercedes-amg-gle-63-s-gls-63-are-600-hp-family-movers.html">GLS 63</a>. Unlike your typical GLS, this one has been tuned by AMG to be quick and agile, while still being luxurious and opulent. Impressive as it is, Mercedes has something else in store; something grander.</p>
      <p>After last week's announcement, the automaker has officially revealed the Mercedes-Maybach GLS. Representing the brand's new form of luxury, it combines the body and spaciousness of a GLS SUV with the high-class appointments one would find on a top-end saloon car.</p>

      <p>While it may still look similar to a standard GLS, this Maybach gets the signature front grill design which can also be found on the S-Class version. Also worth mentioning on the GLS is its unique front apron that has a wide air inlet with a finely woven grill finished in chrome. Additional chrome can also be found throughout the exterior of the GLS including the side window trim, tailgate centerpiece, and rear bumper guard.</p>

      <p>An electronically-controlled running board is also present on the GLS which automatically swings out for passengers to ingress / egress the vehicle. It is made from high-gloss aluminum with anti-slip rubber strips and is only available for this particular model. Meanwhile, massive 22- or 23-inch alloy wheels are available on this Maybach. The smaller set is made from die-cast aluminum while the bigger one is made of forged polished aluminum. Finally, a total of eight two-tone paint combinations are available.</p>

      <p>Open the doors and the GLS greets its occupants with high-quality materials all around. From fine nappa leather, intricate wood trim, and the signature rose gold piping on the white leather trim, the automaker did not skimp on the finest materials they could get their hands on. There is even an electronically-powered panoramic sunroof to let in more sunlight (or moonlight).</p>

      <p>The best seats in the house (or in this case SUV) can be found at the back. In true luxury fashion, the Mercedes-Maybach GLS can only seat 2 at the back. But what you get is a full entertainment suite. Each rear passenger is treated to their own touchscreen media display, massage seats with heating and cooling function, as well as a center-mounted MBUX tablet that they can use. This allows them to control various settings of the cabin like ambient lighting, audio, etc.</p>

      <p>Other available extras that can be installed on this GLS include: folding tables, a refrigerator to store champagne bottles and flutes, a dedicated fragrance system that can perfume the cabin, temperature-controlled cupholders, and a wireless mobile interface which can be had with a Bluetooth receiver for private conversations.</p>

      <p>Under the hood of this Mercedes-Maybach is not a massive V12. Instead, it has a 4.0-liter bi-turbo V8 that churns out 558 PS and 730 Nm of torque. It also benefits from an EQ Boost electric motor which delivers an additional 22 PS with 250 Nm of torque. This allows this luxurious behemoth to sprint from 0 â€“ 100 km/h in 4.9 seconds and hit an electronically-limited top speed of 250 km/h.</p>
      <p>Want to get your own Mercedes-Maybach GLS? The company is already accepting orders and will begin deliveries some time next year. Since there have been numerous sightings of the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class here in the Philippines for the past few years, we won't be surprised to see the GLS as well prowling our roads in the near future.</p>
