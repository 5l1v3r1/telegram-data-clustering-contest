      <p>Five people hoping to represent Shrewsbury and Atcham after the general election on December 12 all appeared at the Shrewsbury Colleges Group's London Road campus last night.</p>
      <p>They were asked questions submitted by the audience, which included about 200 members of the public.</p>
      <p>The candidates included Conservative Daniel Kawczynski, who has held the seat since 2005; Labour candidate Dr Julia Buckley; Nat Green of the Liberal Democrats; the Green Party's Julian Dean; and independent Hannah Locke.</p>
      <p>All of the candidates had two minutes at the start of the evening to set out their election plans.</p>
      <p>Mr Kawczynski used his opening statement to criticise Labour and the Lib Dems' stances on Brexit.</p>
      <p>A question for Brexiteer Mr Kawczynski from a man calling himself 'Rob' said simply: "What is so wrong about the EU?"</p>
      <p>The candidate said in response that the EU is heading towards being a "super-national state" with "power removed from sovereign states".</p>
      <p>He also pointed out that Shrewsbury voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, though Dr Buckley said that it was one of the closest calls in the country.</p>
      <p>She asked the audience to "vote for change, a fresh voice and a fresh face".</p>
      <h3>Brexit</h3>
      <p>She was asked: "Will Labour campaign for Leave or Remain?"</p>
      <p>Dr Buckley answered: "Labour's position is not about winning or losing. Not the extreme of revoking a democratic vote or the extreme of a hard Brexit."</p>
      <p>She said that Labour would offer a new Brexit deal and a 'final say' referendum and said: "You can't keep looking for winners or losers, you need to find consensus.</p>
      <p>"We will not tell you what to think, we will not tell you you are wrong or you are stupid."</p>
      <p>Mr Kawczynski said that the country has a trade deficit with the EU and a trade surplus with the USA.</p>
      <p>He also said: "We need to control immigration because that's what the British people want."</p>
      <p>Mr Green disagreed with Dr Buckley's assertion that a policy of remain was an "extreme position".</p>
      <p>Earlier he said that membership of the EU had benefited Shrewsbury, and said: "The Liberal Democrats are here to keep us in the EU and we're proud about it."</p>
      <p>The Green candidate Julian Dean accepted that the Greens would not form a government but said that his party was leading the others on environmental policies.</p>
      <p>He said: "[A vote for the Greens] is a vote to say there is one absolutely enormous priority and that's the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>"Every extra vote for the Greens puts pressure on the other parties."</p>
      <p>He later said that the climate emergency was replacing immigration as people's main concern.</p>
      <p>"The reason you can't get a GP appointment is not because of immigration," he said. "The scourge of in-work poverty, that is not because of immigration.</p>
      <p>"I think people are starting to realise that."</p>
      <h3>'Young deserve a vote'</h3>
      <p>Hannah Locke, who is running as an independent at the age of 18, would be the youngest MP to ever sit in Parliament were she to win.</p>
      <p>She acknowledged that she has "a lot to learn" but would "learn from those [she] serves" in the interests of Shrewsbury's communities.</p>
      <p>On the EU, she said that people who were unable to vote in the referendum three years ago but now qualify "deserve to have a vote".</p>
      <p>She also said: "Are we so desperate to counter immigration, to push people away that need our help, that we want to crash out of the EU?"</p>
      <p>Mr Kawczynski, meanwhile, said that he has been threatened in the street for his politics and warned that "name-calling and anger" is "seeping through into politics".</p>
      <p>But he also said that he has met several "traditional Labour voters" who have told him they will vote Conservative this year to "get Brexit done".</p>
      <p>Dr Buckley said it was encouraging to see Miss Locke standing as a representative of young engagement in politics.</p>
      <p>She agreed that "aggression" should be kept out of politics.</p>
      <p>The Conservative and Labour representatives both answered questions on the Prime Ministerial ambitions of their party leaders, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn respectively.</p>
      <p>Mr Kawczynski said: "I have every confidence in Mr Johnson. I think he's a man of great intellect, great vision, and he's going to get Brexit done."</p>
      <p>Dr Buckley encouraged people to look beyond the two party leaders, saying "in Shrewsbury and Atcham it is a two-horse race between Mr Daniel Kawczynski and Dr Julia Buckley".</p>
      <p>Mr Green was also asked about his party leader, Jo Swinson. Master of ceremonies Ed Marshall asked if she was being realistic in aspiring to be Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrat said: "Women in politics are held to a different standard than men. When a woman says she wants to be Prime Minister she's looked down on as being inexperienced.</p>
      <p>"Tony Blair wasn't very old, I think he was 41. There's only two years in it." He praised Mrs Swinson's "strong position" on Brexit.</p>
      <h3>Hospitals</h3>
      <p>The county's hospitals and the Future Fit plan were discussed.</p>
      <p>Mr Kawczynski said that 300 doctors and surgeons favoured the Future Fit model of re-allocating the county's hospital provision.</p>
      <p>But Mr Dean of the Greens said that in light of the <a href="https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/health/2019/11/19/shropshire-maternity-scandal-babies-and-mothers-died-amid-toxic-culture-at-nhs-trust/">"appalling" report into maternity services at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital trust that was leaked this week</a> the doctors "are not people for us to trust".</p>
      <p>Dr Buckley said that the NHS "literally cannot survive another winter under this government".</p>
      <p>A Labour government would invest in both infrastructure and staff in the NHS, she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Green said: "The NHS would not survive without workers from the EU."</p>
      <p>Asked what he would do for Shropshire businesses, Mr Kawczynski said: "Reducing taxation, particularly for low rate workers, is very important.</p>
      <p>"Unemployment has fallen down to levels we haven't seen since 1972."</p>
      <p>He said that Labour's "hardcore socialists" would "destroy the economy" if elected.</p>
      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>The candidates were all asked their position on the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>Miss Locke said: "Nationally we have to do something, we don't have the time not to act now."</p>
      <p>"Soon we won't be able to go back on it."</p>
      <p>She called for more recycling initiatives and suggested improving and encouraging the use of public transport.</p>
      <p>Mr Dean said that if green initiatives are not pursued soon, "we are screwed".</p>
      <p>He said that money must be spent but that the outcome would be "a better world".</p>
      <p>Mr Green said he would like Shropshire to be carbon neutral by 2030.</p>
      <p>"It's a tough target but that's what targets are meant to be," he said.</p>
      <p>"What we want to do is have all low income households be insulated by 2025."</p>
      <p>Dr Buckley said economic policy should be "grounded in how we tackle the environment".</p>
      <p>She said Labour wanted to create a million new jobs to build a "new green infrastructure".</p>
      <p>Mr Kawczynski said the country is reducing carbon emissions faster than the EU and the G20.</p>
      <p>"In a globally competitive world we are trying to reduce CO2 emissions as quickly as possible," he said.</p>
      <p>A question near the end of the hustings noted that there were only a handful of under-30s in the audience.</p>
      <p>Shrewsbury Business Chamber chair Val Edwards thanked everyone who attended, as well as Shrewsbury College for hosting the event.</p>
      <p>She also urged the audience to use their right to vote, and encourage friends and family.</p>
      <p>Students from the college prepared hot drinks and cakes for the audience.</p>
