        <b>The draw for the Euro 2020 play-off finals took place in Switzerland today and it hasn't done the Republic of Ireland any favours.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Mick McCarthy's men overcome Slovakia in the March play-off semi-final in Bratislava, they face an away final against either Northern Ireland or Bosnia.</p>
      <p>That means Ireland will have to win two away games, first against Slovakia and then Northern Ireland at Windsor Park or Bosnia at their home stadium in Zenika, to reach Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Scotland have also been handed a tough draw.</p>
      <p>They host Israel in Path C semi-final but should they win, they face an away clash against either Norway or Serbia.</p>
