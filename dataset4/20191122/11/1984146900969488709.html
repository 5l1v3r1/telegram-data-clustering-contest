      <h1>International defender opens the door to Sunderland move in the January window</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland have been credited with interest in centre-back Bahlul Mustafazade</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:34:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Johns</a></address>
      <p>Bahlul Mustafazade has seemingly opened the door to a potential January switch to Sunderland, saying if a move abroad became an option he must consider it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">The Black Cats</a> were credited with interest in the 22-year-old centre-back last month, with Phil Parkinson hoping to put his own stamp on his squad when the transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> has four senior centre-backs at his disposal, only <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jordan-willis">Jordan Willis</a> is contracted beyond the end of the season.</p>
      <p>And Mustafazade, already capped six times by Azerbaijan, is highly touted to have a bright future, having also previously attracted interest from Scottish giants Celtic.</p>
      <p>Currently playing for Sabah in his home country, it is understood the defender would be available for a low price, and he has not closed the door on the potential move.</p>
      <p>Asked by Azerisport specifically about Sunderland's reported interest, he said: "Of course. I really want to [move abroad].</p>
      <p>"I canâ€™t name specifically which club. They did not say anything to me, there was no official proposal.</p>
      <p>"But for development it is necessary to speak abroad. I am aware of this. If there is such an option, then it must be considered."</p>
      <p>After receiving investment from American trio FPP Sunderland in the form of a loan to holding company Madrox, Stewart Donald has vowed to back Parkinson in the January transfer window, with Sunderland's sub-standard season to date showing that new arrivals are needed.</p>
