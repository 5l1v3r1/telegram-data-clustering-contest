        <b>Steven Gerrard insists Rangers will be willing to move fixtures if it helps Scotland realise their Euro 2020 dream.</b>
      </p>
      <p>National team boss Steve Clarke has already urged the governing bodies to "do all they can" to help his team by ensuring there are no fixtures before their semi-final clash in March 2020.</p>
      <p>And Rangers manager Gerrard says the Ibrox club will not stand in their way.</p>
      <p>"I represent this club in this country so for me I give it the support I need to give it. I certainly won't be standing in the way," he said.</p>
      <p>"But we don't make those decisions. Ultimately it will be down to the SFA and stuff.</p>
      <p>"We'll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we'll do everything we can to support (Scotland). That's what you've got to do."</p>
      <p>Gerrard was pleased to see his squad's international representatives return unscathed this week ahead of Sunday's clash at Hamilton.</p>
      <p>He said: "We've had some luck in that department. Everyone is fine and we've got a fully fit squad.</p>
      <p>"Jordan Jones has joined us the last couple of days. We're just waiting for Alfredo Morelos to return, which should be tomorrow."</p>
