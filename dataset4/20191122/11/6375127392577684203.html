      <h3>ACTING on the complaints of a mother who said that her young daughter is being held against her will by the militant Anakbayan, agents of the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group on Thursday rescued the woman while in the company of the militants who were conducting a rally in front of the Far Eastern University in Morayta, Manila, officials said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>CIDG Major Crimes Investigation Unit chief, Lieutenant Colonel Julius Sagandoy, said that Lorevie Caalaman called up her mother Elvie on Wednesday evening and said she wants to quit the leftist organization and go home.</p>
      <p>In turn, Mrs. Caalaman sought the assistance of the CIDG-MCIU in recovering her daughter. Sagandoy said that shortly before noon Thursday, his men, joined by the complainant went to the Anakbayan rally site where the latter eventually identified her daughter.</p>
      <p>The CIDG-MCIU chief said that acting on the information of Mrs. Caalaman, his men took custody of Lorevie who was found to have joined the militant organization when she was still a minor.</p>
      <p>In a report to PNP-CIDG director, Brigadier General Joel Napoleon M. Coronel, the official said that Mrs. Caalaman was one of several parents who appeared before the Senate last August to express their grief over their missing children after they were allegedly recruited by the suspected CPP/NPA/NDF ‘front’ organization in schools and universities.</p>
