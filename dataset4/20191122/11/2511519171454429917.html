        <blockquote>Steven Gerrard insists Rangers will be willing to move fixtures if it helps Scotland realise their Euro 2020 dream.The national side will discover who they will face in March's Nations League play-offs on Friday morning.<br/>Scotland boss Steve Clarke has already urged the governing bodies to "do all they can" to help his team by ensuring there are no fixtures before their semi-final clash.<br/>And Rangers manager Gerrard says the Ibrox club will not stand in their way.<br/>"I represent this club in this country so for me I give it the support I need to give it. I certainly won't be standing in the way," he said.<br/>"But we don't make those decisions. Ultimately it will be down to the SFA and stuff.<br/>"We'll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we'll do everything we can to support (Scotland). That's what you've got to do." PA</blockquote>

        <h3>Romania</h3>
        <p>There was no real surprise that Romania failed in their bid for automatic qualification in Group F.<br/>A tough six-team section included Spain, Sweden and Norway.<br/>Romania finished fourth, above Faroe Island and Malta, with 14 points from four wins and two draws, but their final fixture was a 5-0 defeat in Spain.The Romanians, though, were unbeaten in their Nations League campaign in a group which included Serbia, Lithuania and Montengero.<br/> </p>

        <h3>Israel</h3>
        <p>Scotland faced Israel twice in their Nations League C campaign under former boss Alex McLeish.<br/>The Scots were leading in Haifa against a side ranked 94th in the world before a second-half collapse ended in an embarrassing 2-1 defeat, with John Souttar sent off.<br/>When Israel travelled to Hampden Park for the return game Scotland need a victory to win the group and secure a play-off spot.<br/>James Forrest scored a hat-trick in a nervy 3-2 win although it needed a wonder save from goalkeeper Allan McGregor from Tomer Hemed in the dying seconds to ensure the victory.Israel were well off the pace in their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, finishing fifth out of six with three wins and 11 points from 10 fixtures, 14 points behind Group G winners Poland.<br/> </p>

        <h3>Hungary</h3>
        <p>Hungary, it seems, will be forever associated with their 'Magnificent Magyars' side of the 1950s but these are different times.<br/>The current Hungarian team finished fourth in a relatively tight Group E with Croatia and Wales qualifying automatically.Marco Rossi's side won four and lost four of their eight fixtures and they finished two points behind Ryan Giggs' side after a winner-takes-all clash in Cardiff on Tuesday.<br/> </p>

        <h3>Bulgaria</h3>
        <p>Their Group A campaign will be remembered for the racist behaviour of some of their fans during the 6-0 home defeat to England.<br/>Head coach Krasimir Balakov resigned after his post-match comments while Bulgarian FA president Borislav Mihaylov also stepped side.On the pitch, Bulgaria - now managed by Georgi Dermendzhiev - finished in fourth place with six points, 15 points behind winners England, following their 1-0 home win over Czech Republic at the weekend. The visitors dominated but Vasil Bozhikov's header in the 56th minute sealed Bulgaria's only win of the group stage.<br/> </p>
