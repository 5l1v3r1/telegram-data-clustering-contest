        <b>DigiByte (DGB), the native altcoin of the DigiByte distributed ledger technology (<a href="https://btcmanager.com/saudi-arabia-bahrain-blockchain-technology-finance-international-trade/">DLT</a>) project is now supported on DigiFinex crypto exchange. DigiFinex users can now trade the DGB/USDT pair and the exchange has hinted that it’s conducting a token airdrop to reward new users, according to a blog post on November 21, 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>DigiFinex Adds Support for DigiByte (DGB)</h3>
      <p>Just days after announcing the creation of its foundation, DigiByte has achieved another significant milestone in its journey towards mainstream adoption, as DigiFinex, one of the top crypto exchanges in the world has listed the DGB altcoin.</p>
      <p>Per a blog <a href="https://dgbat.org/2019/11/21/digibyte-dgb-to-be-launched-on-digifinex/">post</a> by the DigiByte Awareness Team, DigiByte’s native cryptocurrency, DGB has commenced trading on DigiFinex, supporting the DGB/USDT open trade pair for now.</p>
      <p>The DigiByte team said:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>On behalf of the DigiByte Awareness Team and forthcoming DigiBye Foundation, we are proud to announce DigiByte’s listing on DigiFinex exchange. One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, DigiFinexis headquartered in Singapore. Their presence across Asia makes them the preferred trading platform of more than 3 million users across the globe.</b>”</blockquote>
      <p>The DigiByte blockchain network has been in existence since 2013 and it remains one of the most decentralized DLT platforms in the world.</p>
      <h4>DigiByte Slowly Gaining Traction </h4>
      <p>Though the DGB altcoin is currently ranked 54th on the CoinMarketCap top 100 cryptos able, with a market cap of $86.3 million, the DigiByte blockchain has however achieved several impressive milestones since its creation.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, DigiByte is the first blockchain network to be forked from a single proof-of-work algorithm to multi-algorithm mining, it’s one of the first blockchains to support <a href="https://btcmanager.com/full-segwit-support-new-bitcoin-deployment-version-0-16-0/">Segregated Witness (SegWit)</a>, Odocrypt and DigiShield, a functionality that prevents the over-inflation of easily mined coins by re-targeting difficulty.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that DigiByte’s DigiShield feature has since been <a href="https://www.dgbwiki.com/index.php?title=DigiShield">adopted</a> by other top cryptos, including Ether.</p>
      <p>In a bid to accelerate the growth of DigiByte, reinforce its ethos of true decentralization and promote broader adoption of blockchain technology, the DigiByte team <a href="https://btcmanager.com/digibyte-dgb-launches-own-foundation-to-empower-community-members/">announced</a> the launch of the DigiByte Foundation earlier in November 2019.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://btcmanager.com/utrust-digibyte-dgb-payments-airlines/">reported</a> by <i>BTCManager </i>on November 14, 2019, UTRUST integrated DigiByte (DGB) into its system as a means of providing safe and secure payment options for Alternative Airline customers.</p>
