      <h1>Jose Mourinho doubles down on young players comments with fresh Man Utd remark</h1>
      <h2>The new Tottenham manager is insistent that he will give youth a chance at Spurs despite being criticised for not doing so during his time at Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:47:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has continued to insist he will promote youth players at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and has aimed a dig at the quality of his former club Manchester United's academy.</p>
      <p>In his first interview at his new club he told Spurs TV: "The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>He was criticised by some during his time at United for continuing to playing more senior players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marouane Fellaini instead of younger talent, but in an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1197832405626900481">BT Sport</a> Mourinho said that the potential in United's academy was not good enough.</p>

      <p>"There are clubs that are better than others in creating conditions for the young players," he said. "When I arrived at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> the U23 team were relegated. When a team is relegated, it is because the quality is not there.</p>
      <p>"The quality was in the younger ones, so we put them in the first-team, played them in pre-season games, and this was the generation that had more potential than the other.</p>
      <p>"But every manager wants to play young players. If the potential is there, you are very happy to help the young guys to develop."</p>

      <p>The likes of 17-year-old striker Troy Parrott, who recently made his senior debut for the Republic of Ireland, and 20-year-old defender Japhet Tanganga are thought to be among those pushing for a place in the Spurs squad, and Mourinho reportedly praised the latter in training after he marked <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> during the 3-2 friendly win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in pre-season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will make his managerial bow for Spurs when they take on London rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He will then oversee his first home game in a crucial Champions League match when Tottenham host Olympiacos on Tuesday night.</p>
