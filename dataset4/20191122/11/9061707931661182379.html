      <h1>Controversy as decades-old Derby social club to be turned into Sikh Gurdwara</h1>
      <h2>The application received numerous objections</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:38:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author">Paige Oldfield</a></address>
      <p>Controversial plans to turn a 45-year-old Derby social club into a Sikh place of worship have been approved.</p>
      <p>Plans to change the use of <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/big-plans-sinfin-moor-social-3402382">Sinfin Moor Social Club</a> were given the green light by <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/chellaston-planning-houses-development-3565298">Derby City Council’s planning committee</a> last night.</p>
      <p>Applicant, the Sarbat Da Bhalla Charitable Foundation Trust, said the venue, in Arleston Lane, will "serve the dual purpose of being a Gurdwara (place of worship) for the Sikh community and a community hub for all the local community".</p>
      <p>But Sinfin councillors argued that the loss of the social club could have a negative impact on the area.</p>
      <p>They were jeered from the public gallery last night as they put forward their objections.</p>
      <p>Councillor Baggy Shanker was branded “ignorant” and a “liar” as he spoke about how the loss of the social club could negatively impact Sinfin.</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to make it clear that objecting to or supporting the application would “not in any way infer that a particular community is against any other”.</p>
      <p>He said: “For those of you who know Sinfin, you will appreciate the vast benefit this facility has for the whole community.</p>
      <p>“There are many regular events at this club.</p>
      <p>“Many use it to celebrate family occasions and to reflect on the loss of a loved one.</p>
      <p>“As a councillors, I have a duty to protect that.</p>
      <p>“I object to this planning application on the basis of detrimental impact the loss of the social club would have on Sinfin.”</p>

      <p>Councillor Joanna West added that the social club is a “well-known and loved building in the community” and could see “no reason” to change the use.</p>
      <p>The community hub will hold meditation and wellness classes and is set to be a venue for local groups in the community to meet.</p>
      <p>The foundation trust promotes the well-being of all human beings, all living creatures and of the planet's natural resources.</p>
      <p>The social club is owned by Why Not (UK) Ltd and the site is close to Sinfin District centre and Sinfin Moor Ecumenical Church.</p>
      <p>Conditions for the plans include that the foundation trust must provide parking bays and cycle parking.</p>
      <p>The community room will be open from 10am to 4pm daily and the rest of the site from 5am to 10pm. The Gurdwara will be installed in the existing function room.</p>
      <p>There are currently four existing Gurdwaras in Derby, the nearest being 1.8 miles away and the farthest 2.4 miles.</p>
      <p>It is intended that volunteers will run and support the Gurdwara and the community room.</p>
      <p>A chef, a priest and a facility manager will be employed.</p>
