      <p>India’s Ishant Sharma on Friday became the first Indian bowler to claim five wickets with the pink ball as Bangladesh were bundled out for 106 in Kolkata Test. Batting first, Bangladesh found the going tough from the word go as the Indian pacers began to wreak havoc against the Tigers.</p>
