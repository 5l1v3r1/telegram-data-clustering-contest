      <p>China wants to work out an initial trade agreement with the United States and has been trying to avoid a trade war, but it is not afraid to retaliate when necessary, President Xi Jinping said on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We want to work for a 'phase one' agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality," Xi told representatives of an international forum, according to a pool report.</p>
      <p>"When necessary we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war. We did not initiate this trade war and this is not something we want."</p>
      <p>Xi was at the Great Hall of the People responding to questions from representatives of the New Economy Forum organised by Bloomberg LP in Beijing.</p>
