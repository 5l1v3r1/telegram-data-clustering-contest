      <p>Lionel Messi sent a strange gift to Borussia Dortmund wonder kid Youssoufa Moukoko for his 15th birthday — a photo collage of himself.</p>
      <p>Moukoukou, who is touted as one of the world's top footballing prospects, arrived at training on Wednesday to find the present from the Argentine waiting for him, <a href="https://africa.espn.com/football/blog-the-toe-poke/story/3994883/barcelonas-lionel-messi-sends-dortmund-prodigy-moukoko-gifts-for-15th-birthday">according to ESPN.</a></p>
      <p>"Oh my god! Got this as a gift from my idol. Many thanks, Leo Messi. Thanks for all your birthday wishes," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/youssoufa_10/?hl=en">the teenager posted on Instagram,</a> posing alongside the oddly-assembled photo collection.</p>

      <p>He also held up a separate photo of Messi, and was sat next to a pair of Nike trainers with a card alongside them that read "Youssoufa" on the envelope.</p>
      <p>Messi also sent Moukoko an FC Barcelona shirt that had been signed by various players at the club, which the 15-year-old shared a photo of in a since expired Instagram story.</p>
      <p>Moukoko has previously spoken of the Barca forward as his football icon, <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/lionel-messi-aubameyang-inspirations-for-youssoufa-moukoko-borossia-dortmund-518092.jsp">telling Bundesliga.com in November 2018:</a> "Messi has always been my role model. Nobody else can do what he does."</p>
      <p>And he's doing his best to impersonate the 32-year-old with Dortmund's youth teams. </p>
      <p>The Cameroon-born striker has scored 18 times in just 11 games this term for the Under-19 team, <a href="https://africa.espn.com/football/blog-the-toe-poke/story/3994883/barcelonas-lionel-messi-sends-dortmund-prodigy-moukoko-gifts-for-15th-birthday">according to ESPN,</a> including hitting six on his debut against Wuppertaler SV in August.</p>
      <p>Last season for the Under-17s, he managed an astonishing 40 goals after making his debut aged 12, while also become the youngest-ever player to score in the UEFA Youth League.</p>
