      <p>Cape Town - Musician Winnie Khumalo is not feeling well again.</p>
      <p>The singer says she’s suffering from ulcers and is waiting for a specialist to check on her.</p>
      <p>According to Winnie she was diagnosed with ulcers after she fell during a performance in 2010 and had to go to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <b>Move!</b> she confirmed the reports that she’s not doing well but assured us that she’s feeling much better and can barely wait to set stages on fire this festive season.</p>
      <p>The<i> Live my life</i> hitmaker says after days of not feeling well she decided to seek medical help.</p>
      <p>“I was not ill and thought I could heal by myself. But when I wasn’t getting better, I went to see the doctor. The doctor has referred me to a specialist to look into my matter so they could give me the right medication,” she explains.</p>
      <p>Winnie is now at home, waiting for the specialist appointment. “I am hoping to see the specialist on Tuesday next week,” she says.</p>
      <p>She then jokes, “Why are you waking up a patient though?” but quickly adds that she wants to get back to work before the festive season begins.</p>
      <p>“I can’t afford to get sick. I want to get on stage and work. It’s December, I can’t be sick,” she says.</p>
      <p>Winnie has been in and out of hospital in recent years. There were also reports – which she denied – that she was bedridden for two months.</p>
      <p>Now, she promises that she’ll be good to go and entertain her fans in no time.</p>
      <p>She also took to her Instagram account to thank her fans for their support during this time.</p>
      <p>“It feels so good to be loved. Your prayers made a huge difference. You gave me a reason to fight now ready to work and sidlale iPiano [sic],” she posted.</p>
