      <p>The Browne family and friends have actively being raising funds through the “Baxter the Brave” gofundme.com page and have received huge generosity from the local community. </p>
      <p>Niall Walsh, MACE Clogherhead owner and all the team wanted to support this worthy cause and were very proactive in their approach to linking the in-store fundraiser with customers’ love for tea and coffee.

I would like to thank all our customers who donated and got behind the fundraiser. I’d like to wish Baxter the very best of luck with his treatment and best wishes for him and his family for the future.”</p>
