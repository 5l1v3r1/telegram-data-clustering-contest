      <h1>Look away now West Ham fans – this Lucas Perez stat is madness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:15:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>West Ham United fans didn’t really bat much of an eyelid when Lucas Perez was sold in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was one of four attackers to depart the club, with Marko Arnautovic, Javier Hernandez and Andy Carroll all leaving as well.</p>
      <p>Perez only signed for the Hammers in the summer of 2018 from Arsenal, but couldn’t make an impact for the Londoners.</p>

      <p>Remarkably, he managed to make his paltry £4 million fee (<a href="https://www.football.london/west-ham-united-fc/transfer-news/lucas-perez-to-west-ham-14996070">football.london</a>) look expensive.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini used him sparingly, and he could only contribute six goals in 19 appearances.</p>
      <p>Perez left West Ham for Deportivo Alaves for around £2.2 million (<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11732659/west-ham-agree-to-sell-lucas-perez-to-alaves">Sky Sports</a>), and most people thought they wouldn’t be hearing from him again. That they could just pretend he never happened.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Perez has set about showing how good a finisher he really is.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7682371/Lucas-Perez-struggled-Arsenal-West-Ham.html">According to The Daily Mail</a>, Perez is statistically Europe’s most clinical forward having converted 46.1% of his chances.</p>
      <p>He may ‘only’ have seven goals to his name so far, but in terms of putting away chances there’s nobody better right now.</p>
      <p>Of course, the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Robert Lewandowski have far more goals, but they are in teams that create more chances for them to squander.</p>
      <p>Perez’s rate puts him marginally ahead of the Premier League’s Jamie Vardy (45.5%), whose finishing has been next level this term.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Were West Ham too hasty?</h3>
      <p>Perez’s amazing form is getting to be quite uncomfortable for West Ham supporters.</p>

      <p>Some might have thought he’d improve back in his homeland, but nobody would have predicted this kind of prolificacy.</p>
      <p>Having struggled at Arsenal too, some put Perez’s failings in England down to adaptability issues.</p>
      <p>But maybe he just wasn’t given a fair crack, with both Arsene Wenger and Pellegrini mostly keeping him on the fringes.</p>
