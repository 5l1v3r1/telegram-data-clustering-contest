      <p>IT HAS BEEN confirmed that Ireland will compete away from home in the play-off final if they win their away semi-final against Slovakia, following today’s draw in Nyon.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.the42.ie/denmark-ireland-4896306-Nov2019/">failing to beat Denmark on Monday</a>, Mick McCarthy’s side missed out on automatic qualification from their group for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>They must now play Slovakia away from home on 26 March in a Nations League play-off semi-final, before a potential final against either Bosnia or Northern Ireland on 31 March.</p>
      <p>Slovakia have until 20 December to confirm the venue for the match against Ireland, with Bratislava or Trnava the most likely locations.</p>
      <p>The details in relation to the other play-off semi-finals were also confirmed today (see below), with these games set to determine which four teams will join the 20 already confirmed for this summer’s tournament.</p>
