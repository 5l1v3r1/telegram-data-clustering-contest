      <p>Steve Clarke’s men will play Israel in a one-legged semi-final at Hampden on March 26, before a final away game against Norway or Serbia on March 31.</p>
      <p>Scotland – who failed to gain automatic qualification from Group I, ending their campaign against Kazakhstan on Tuesday – were in the same group as Israel in the UEFA Nations League, losing 2-1 away from home before winning 3-2 in Glasgow and topping the pool.</p>
      <p>Should Scotland win both play-off games they will qualify for a first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup in France.</p>
      <p>The draw was made at UEFA headquarters in Nyon.</p>
