      <h3>THE two highest sports leaders in the land see Team Philippines emerging proud and victorious for the second time in the long, rich history of the Southeast Asian Games which opens its 30th edition in glittering rites rich in songs, dances and a lot more a few days from now.</h3>
      <p>Philippine Olympic Committee president Bambol Tolentino and Philippine Sports Commission chairman Butch Ramirez said the long, tedious, expensive preparations Team Philippines underwent is expected to result in an overall triumph in the 12-day, 10-nation meet kicking off on Nov. 30 at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
      <p>“Our athletes are 100 percent ready,” said Tolentino in a text message to People’s Journal yesterday. “We have  very good chances of winning the overall title”.</p>
      <p>Like Tolentino, Ramirez is brimming with confidence that the Filipino athletes will end up with the overall  crown tucked under their belts, saying Team Philippines has prepared long and hard in a bid to achieve the feat in its homesoil.</p>
      <p>Ramirez is also the team’s Chef of Mission, marking the second time in his long stay in sports that he’ll play the role. When the country emerged champion in 2005 when it hosted it for the third time since 1977, Team PH finished No. 1 in what officials dubbed as the ‘Miracle of 2005”.</p>
      <p>“Our support is unprecedented.We provided everything to them specially overseas training and participation in international competitions.I’m confident our athletes will deliver and make our country proud,” Ramirez said.</p>
      <p>“Dito pa gagawin sa atin ang SEA Games, kaya malaki talaga ang chance (to win the overall title),” told sportswriters in an informal gathering the other night.</p>
      <p>A total of 1,420 athletes, coaches and officials—the biggest Team PH ever assembled in any international events—will carry the national colors in the sporting showpiece which was almost cancelled following the infamous Mindanao uprising more than a year ago.</p>
      <p>Tolentino said our athletes are expected to strike heavily in combat sports and several ballgames like basketball and softball where at least 100 gold medals are likely to be won by Filipino bets.</p>
      <p>“May pondo na agad tayo ng 100 golds, plus may dagdag pa,” said Tolentino, adding that total is lower than the one promised to him when he met officials of the National Sports Associations a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>There was even this boast of several NSA officials who told Ramirez in a separate meeting that they could deliver a whopping total of 220 gold medals.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing this, top PSC officials with Ramirez  on the head table were seen almost falling off their seats.</p>
      <p>Ramirez believes the athletes are not affected by talks about some disruptions plaguing the Philippine Sea Games Organising Committee (Phisgoc) headed by House Speaker  Alan Peter Cayetano.</p>
      <p>Early this week, Phisgoc came under fire from senator Franklin Drilon, who hit the cost of the cauldron in the newly-built stadium in New Clark City, describing it as extravagant.</p>
      <p>But Cayetano defended it during a Senate hearing, and found a strong ally in President Duterte, who said he found no extravagance in the construction of the cauldron which Drilon mocked as “kaldero”.</p>
      <p>In the same meeting with sportswriters, Ramirez said he has no idea of the opening ceremonies except to say that world boxing hero Manny Pacquiao will light the cauldron to signify the opening of the meet.</p>
      <p>The PSC boss said world gymnastics champion Carlos Yulo will pass the torch to the senator during the opening rites while six other top athletes led by Rio Olympics weightlifting silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz and Asian Games skateboarding champ Margilyn Didal will be the flag bearers.</p>
      <p>“They keep it a secret (opening rites program). All I know is that senator Pacquiao will light the cauldron after getting it from Yulo and Diaz, Didal and four others will carry the flag,” said Ramirez.</p>
      <p>“The other highlights are not being divulged,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meantime, two  main venues have yet to be completed, according to Cayetano. These are in Tagaytay and Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.</p>
      <p>"Usually countries have four years [to prepare]. We had a little bit below two years so Subic and then Tagaytay and then Rizal may hinahabol pa talaga," he told reporters during a visit to the main hub in Tarlac.</p>
      <p>The Tagaytay venue will be completed this week, while officials have prepared contingency plans in case the Rizal Stadium cannot be completed in time for the November 30 opening.</p>
      <p>"I can tell you, handang-handa na tayo," Cayetano said.</p>
      <p>"The reality of hosting games like this where you have a thousand foreign journalists here, 11,000 athletes and coaches, and 9,000 volunteers... may day-to-day crisis management yan and day-to-day problems, including traffic. Doon ang sinasabi kong handa, prepared," he said.</p>
      <p>Most of the delays were caused by the late passage of the 2019 budget, which contained funds for SEA Games.</p>
