      <h1>Disabled children in Bridgend are having to wait 18 months for home adaptations</h1>
      <h2>Bridgend County Borough Council is ranked 20th out of 22 local authorities in Wales for the time it takes to deliver a Disabled Facilities Grant.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:29:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">Elizabeth Bradfield</a></address>
      <p>Disabled children in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/bridgend">Bridgend</a> are having to wait an average of around 18 months to receive adaptations in their homes which would enable them to continue living with their families, new figures show.</p>
      <p>Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs) are paid by the local authority and can help towards the cost of adapting homes, helping disabled children and adults to get in, around and out of their properties.</p>
      <p>They can be used for things like installing a stairlift to improve access to a room, providing a level-access shower, or helping to make cooking easier by providing low level units.</p>
      <p>But in Bridgend residents have a long wait to receive the necessary adaptations – on average it takes around 244 days, or eight months, to deliver an adult DFG, and 500 days to deliver a children’s DFG.</p>
      <p>A year ago the average was almost two years for children’s grants to be signed off and work completed.</p>
      <p>At a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/bridgend-council">Bridgend County Borough Council</a> audit committee, chairman Lyn Walters raised concerns that due to the length of time taken, pressure on families looking after a severely disabled child with complex needs could see them split up due to the stress.</p>
      <p>Council officers said children’s cases tended to be more complex, often involving bedroom and wet room extensions which required detailed design and planning.</p>
      <p>The local authority is ranked 20th out of 22 local authorities in Wales for the time it takes to deliver a grant.</p>
      <p>On average it takes 270 days – this compares to the Wales average of 207 days.</p>
      <p>Out-of-date practices were flagged up in a recent service review, highlighting the number of times work was passed to other people during the DFG process – which range between four and 38 times in some cases.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, councillors asked officers why the local authority was still 20th, despite a series of recommendations made by the Wales Audit Office over a year ago to improve services.</p>
      <p>Head of performance and partnership services, Martin Morgans, said delays in improvement were down to the service being remodelled.</p>
      <p>He said: “We had a staff restructure in housing that wasn’t complete until the end of 2018 and we wanted to remodel.</p>
      <p>“We can’t make decisions on where we want to go unless we know where to go.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done a considerable amount of research on DFGs in Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot, looking at best practice, and having an independent consultant look at the challenges we are facing.</p>
      <p>“We now know what model to deliver but it’s been a huge amount of work placing the recommendations into a new working model.</p>
      <p>“It’s a challenge, we shouldn’t be 20th, it hurts me to say that.</p>
      <p>“Our objective is to definitely improve on that – I expect not to be 20th in the next 12 months.”</p>
      <p>He admitted the number of times work was passed to other people during the process was “quite shocking”, saying the new model would cut down on “a lot of bureaucracy” and create a single point of interaction, reducing the number of hand offs and making it more transparent to residents.</p>
      <p>He added that other changes had been made to the process to ensure residents were given the right information at the earliest stage possible to ensure expectations were not being set “beyond what we can deliver”.</p>
      <p>Cardiff Council ranks 6th in Wales, taking an average of 188 days to deliver DFGs, with Conwy first and Flintshire last, taking an average of 126 days and 298 days respectively.</p>
      <p>The maximum amount that can be awarded for a DFG is £36,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Morgans said the council was also taking a “far more pragmatic approach” to minor works, saying: “The quicker we put in ramps and handrails the more we can mitigate falls.”</p>
      <p>Minor works currently take on average around nine days to be completed.</p>
      <p>Officers said a report on the new model would go before cabinet in the near future.</p>
