      <h3>MAYOR Isko Moreno was bestowed the first ever award as an ‘epitome of a genuine public servant’ at the 10th anniversary of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) College of Education.</h3>
      <p>The said university cited Moreno as a ‘great model for future educators’ and thus became the first recipient of the ‘Gawad Uliran at Respetadong Opisyal (GURO) ng Bayan’ owing to his ‘outstanding accomplishments and exemplary leadership’ as the new mayor of Manila.</p>
      <p>For his part, Moreno called on the students to make the most of their parents’ efforts by studying well and finishing their college education.</p>
      <p>He said that as students at the college of education, the country’s future rests on their hands as they will be the future molders of tomorrow’s leaders of the land.</p>
      <p>‘Tiyagain nyo ang paghulma sa tamang mindset ng  mga estudyante, inspire them to aspire,’ the mayor said.</p>
      <p>Students and faculty members of the PUP, known for having a huge number of left-leaning in its ranks, cheered on Moreno as he continued speaking amid a heavy downpour, leaving one side of his pants and shirt all wet.</p>
      <p>Moreno was welcomed by thundering applause and wild cheers and chants by thousands of students who trooped to the affair to listen to him as the guest speaker in the said occasion.</p>
      <p>The mayor said he is deeply touched by the gesture, specially after learning that it was the first ever to be bestowed by the said university to a public official.</p>
