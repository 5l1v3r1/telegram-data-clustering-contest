      <p>MEXICO CITY — Mexican authorities have arrested a judge who the U.S. Treasury Department alleges is linked to Jalisco New Generation, one of the country’s bloodiest drug cartels.</p>
      <p>Mexico’s General Council of the Judiciary had presented a complaint to federal prosecutors in May against Isidro Avelar Gutiérrez for purported “asset irregularities and additional income.”</p>
      <p>Earlier that month the U.S. Treasury designated and sanctioned him under the Kingpin Act “because of his actions on behalf” of Jalisco New Generation and an allied group known as Los Cuinis.</p>
      <p>U.S. authorities alleged Avelar Gutiérrez took bribes from the organizations “in exchange for providing favourable judicial rulings to their senior members.”</p>
      <p>The General Council of the Judiciary announced Friday’s arrest in Guadalajara, saying in a statement that he was being taken to Mexico City.</p>
