      <p>The hit CW show <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/riverdale/">Riverdale</a> </i>has recently given its Jughead Jones a diverging path from the core cast; while the others are fighting their respective villains, Jughead is digging into his personal past, and his time at Stonewall Prep has led him to discover some surprising things about his family, particularly his grandfather Forsythe Pendleton Jones.</p>
      <p>Based on a newly released synopsis for the episode titled "Chapter Sixty-Six: Tangerine," it seems he will finally track down his long-lost grandfather, despite his father's objection. Elsewhere, Veronica has declared war on her father, and the feud heats up when she enlists a secret weapon -- her Abuelita -- against him. Meanwhile, Betty and her brother Charles grapple with their problems while they investigate some strange attacks on Betty, Archie and F.P. team up to fight the street gang led by Dodger and Cheryl finally starts to make peace with her own past.</p>
