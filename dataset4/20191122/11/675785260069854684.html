      <h1>Robbie Savage's Premier League predictions as Man Utd tipped for surprise result</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd face Sheffield United, while Man City and Chelsea is the biggest game of the weekend. Liverpool travel to Crystal Palace as Jose Mourinho starts at Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:39:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Robbie Savage has predicted Manchester United to drop points to Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side travel to Bramell Lane hoping to extend their winning streak to three matches, having beaten Partizan Belgrade and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> before the international break.</p>
      <p>But Savage reckons that the Red Devils could struggle against the Blades - who are two places and a point ahead of them in the table after a stunning start to the season following their promotion from the Championship.</p>
      <p>The former Birmingham midfielder has plucked for a score draw in the clash to leave United's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League in tatters.</p>

      <p>The biggest game of the weekend comes at the Etihad Stadium, where <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>And the reigning champions are forecast to suffer a second defeat in a row and lose yet more ground on table toppers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>City lost 3-1 to the Reds before the international break but haven't tasted defeat at home since April 2018.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho makes his debut in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> dugout on Saturday lunchtime, having taken over from Mauricio Pochettino earlier this week - but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> are predicted to win the London derby and stun the Portuguese's big return.</p>
