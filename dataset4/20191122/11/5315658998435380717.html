      <h1>Finance Minister complacent about NZ’s growth</h1>

      <p>Paul Goldsmith - Finance</p>
      <p>22 November 2019</p>
      <p>Rather than congratulating himself on New Zealand’s modest economic growth, Grant Robertson should be honest about why we’re missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
      <p>“New Zealand should be doing very well right now. Our export prices are at historically high levels, interest rates are low and the Government inherited big surpluses.</p>
      <p>“What Grant Robertson fails to mention is that about three quarters of New Zealand’s economic growth is driven by population growth, not productivity improvements.</p>
      <p>“Our growth per person, which is the true measure of the progress we are making as a country, is currently only 0.5 per cent. That is well behind most of the OECD.</p>
      <p>“What’s worse, business investment has fallen from 5 per cent a year under National to just 0.6 per cent under Labour, job growth has fallen from around 10,000 new jobs a month under National to just 3,000 under Labour and there are 22,000 more people on the dole.</p>
      <p>“National has higher aspirations for New Zealand. We want to see Kiwis better off. Muddling along at 0.5 per cent growth per person is nothing to crow about.</p>
      <p>“Business is in a funk in this country, primarily because they lack confidence in this Government’s economic policies – policies that have driven up costs and created massive uncertainty. They’re also disheartened by this Government’s lack of delivery.</p>
      <p>“If National is elected in 2020 we’ll stop the excuses and get on with implementing our positive economic plan to restore business confidence and revive the economy.”</p>
