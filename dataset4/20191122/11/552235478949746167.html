      <h1>Israel profiled as Scotland's Euro 2020 playoff opponents are discovered</h1>
      <h2>Two huge games are coming up in March for Scotland as they look to end 22 years without reaching a major tournament.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:35:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>It's finally decided and Scotland now know who they need to beat to reach the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> finals.</p>
      <p>Israel are the opponents and if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke's</a> men get through that one then it's an away tie against either Norway or Serbia in the final.</p>
      <p>Although Scotland faced Israel in the Nations Leauge, a lot has changed since then.</p>
      <p>Off the field Steve Clarke has replaced <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-mcleish">Alex McLeish</a> while on the pitch, only four players who played at Hampden in the 3-2 win started against Kazakhstan on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Scott McKenna, Callum McGregor, Ryan Christie and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-forrest">James Forrest</a> all started and although it's likely Andy Robertson would also have started, that's still half a team that has changed.</p>
      <p>Even on the bench, all three goalkeepers from that squad are now no longer involved with Allan McGregor retired, Scott Bain unable to get a game at Celtic and Jamie MacDonald now at Alloa.</p>

      <p>But what about the opponents? Here's how they look ahead of the game in March.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PROFILED</b>
      </p>
      <p>There should be nothing unfamiliar about the Israelis after Scotland faced them twice during their initial Nations League campaign.</p>
      <p>A shambolic display in Haifa saw us throw away a half-time lead in their first meeting, with John Souttar’s sending off and Kieran Tierney’s own goal leaving a playoff spot in the balance.</p>
      <p>A must-win meeting at Hampden produced the required result with a 3-2 victory but it was a far nervier affair than it should have been. James Forrest’s hat-trick got the job done as the Scots came from behind, but the last 15 minutes was backs-to-the wall stuff at times.</p>
      <p>Andi Herzog’s team were well off the pace in their qualifying group, finishing on 11 points from 10 games, ahead of only Latvia as Poland and Austria qualified with relative comfort. A 4-2 win over Austria was the standout result for the Israelis.</p>
      <p>Hibs goalkeeper Ofir Marciano and Celtic duo Hatem Abd Elhamed and Nir Bitton are well known, as is former Celtic man Beram Kayal, who scored their opener in Glasgow last November.</p>

      <p>Striker Eran Zahavi finished the campaign on 11 goals – the same as Cristiano Ronaldo and two behind top scorer Harry Kane. Fellow frontman Moanes Dabour of Sevilla has caused problems for both Scotland and Celtic before. <b> </b></p>
      <p><b>FORMED:</b> 1948.</p>
      <p><b>FIFA RANKING:</b> 89.</p>
      <p><b>STADIUM:</b> Turner Stadium, Be'er Sheva (16,126), also use stadiums in Haifa and Jerusalem.</p>
      <p><b>MANAGER:</b> Andreas Herzog.</p>
      <p><b>STAR MAN:</b> Moanes Dabour. Seville striker who netted a double against Celtic while playing for Red Bull Salzburg. Cost the La Liga side £15 million, but has only featured in the Europa League so far.</p>
      <p><b>EURO 2020 CAMPAIGN:</b> Finished fifth out of six teams and was their worst campaign for 24 years. Never in with a chance of qualifying.</p>
      <p><b>INTERESTING FACT:</b> They are in the only country in UEFA who have previously qualified for a tournament who have had to endure a longer wait than Scotland to qualify. Their last tournament was the World Cup in 1970.</p>
