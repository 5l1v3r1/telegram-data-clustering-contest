      <p>The Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">already down</a> to its Black Friday price, coming in at just $100. Taking $50 off of its regular price.</p>
      <p>The Fire HD 10 is one of Amazon's best selling tablets right now. It has over 700 reviews, with an average of 4.5 stars out of five. So it's a pretty good tablet.</p>
      <p>This is also the newest version, that just came out back in September. So it's got all of the latest and greatest tech inside. We're looking at a 10.1-inch Full HD display. Powered by an octa-core 2GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is a 64GB of storage model available that will cost slightly more.</p>

      <p>Now if that's not enough storage for you, there is a micro SD card slot that you can utilize to have even more storage. And it now supports up to 500GB. That's plenty of space for storing content offline for a long flight or car ride.</p>
      <p>With the Fire HD 10 tablet, you also have Amazon Alexa built-in. This will allow you to control your smart home products, ask Alexa for something to watch and much more. Alexa continues to improve every single day, with more and more skills being added all of the time.</p>
      <p>Of course, we can't forget that the Fire HD 10 now has USB-C for charging. And it also has fast charging. It has a 9W power adapter in the box. Which, that's not super fast, like the Galaxy Note 10+'s 25W or 45W charging, but 9W is almost twice the speed of the smaller 5W charger that was available with the Fire HD 10 previously. So that's a nice upgrade. And it should cut charging times down quite a bit.</p>
