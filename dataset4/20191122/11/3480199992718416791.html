      <p>Colin Skipp, who played Tony Archer for more than 40 years on The Archers, has died at the age of 80.</p>
      <p>The Radio 4 programme said Skipp, who featured in many of Ambridge’s most memorable storylines, “will be greatly missed”.</p>
      <p>Skipp played Tony Archer from 1967 to 2013 before bowing out of the BBC soap because of ill health.</p>
      <p>Its editor Jeremy Howe said: “Colin had a wonderful voice, which made Tony singular and distinctive: He was absolutely Colin’s creation”.</p>

      <p>Pat Gallimore, who plays Tony’s wife Pat in the Radio 4 drama, said: “Colin and I shared many years together as radio spouses before ill health forced him to retire, and I have 40 years of memories to look back on with happiness.</p>
      <p>“Colin was a very fine actor who brought truth and integrity to the role of Tony, as well as being a good friend and generous colleague.”</p>
      <p>His character faced tragedy over the years, blaming himself when his son John was killed in a tractor accident in 1998.</p>
      <p>Tony had a reckless streak in his youth and at one point an exasperated Pat moved out.</p>
      <p>The couple had two other children, Helen and Tom.</p>
      <p>They created Bridge Farm with its profitable organic unit, which was at the vanguard of radical thinking at the time.</p>
      <p>Skipp retired from the programme after having a series of heart attacks and actor David Troughton took over the character.</p>
