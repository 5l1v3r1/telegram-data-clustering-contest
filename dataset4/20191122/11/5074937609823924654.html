      <h1>Rigworld presents ambulance to Regional Maritime University Sick Bay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:28:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Morkporkpor Anku, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - The Management of Rigworld Training Centre (RTC), an indigenous Ghanaian company, has presented an ambulance to the Sick Bay of the Regional Maritime University (RMU).</p>
      <p>The ambulance, which is estimated to cost over 20,000 Euros is fully fitted with modern State of the Art equipment and is the first-ever to be dedicated to the University's Sick Bay within its 60 years of existence.</p>
      <p>The donation of the ambulance comes as a big relief to the Maritime University community as it will help deal with emergencies in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>Mr Steve Taylor, the Managing Director for Rigworld Training Centre, presenting the ambulance at a ceremony on the campus of the RMU, said the donation was to support the Sick Bay.</p>
      <p>He said, "it gives us an opportunity to help them to increase their capabilities in terms of support for their safety and their emergency response.”</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor announced plans to construct a training centre similar to its centre in Takoradi in the premises of RMU.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwame Nyampong, a member of the legal team of Rigworld Group, said "We currently have a 10-year memorandum of understanding with RMU after which we have signed a collaborative agreement in which the parties have made certain pledges".</p>
      <p>He said RMU had allocated two acres of land to them to replicate the training facility they have in Takoradi to be built on their campus to cater for the Accra market.</p>
      <p>"We have the financial muscles and intend to invest some huge sums putting up that ultra-modern training facility,” he added.</p>
      <p>Professor Elvis Nyarko, Vice-Chancellor, expressed gratitude for the gesture, indicating that the ambulance would go a long way to prevent the unconventional way used in the past to convey the sick and the injured to nearby health facilities.</p>
      <p>He said the University had been in need of an ambulance and they were thankful to the Centre for the support.</p>
      <p>He said ever since the Sick Bay was opened close to 60 years, this was the first time "we are actually having an ambulance dedicated to the Sick Bay".</p>
      <p>The Vice-Chancellor said the kind of training undertaken at the University, the Cadet training and their offshore safety programmes; there were times the University have to train participants on emergency response.</p>
      <p>During such training programmes, when the Cadets gets hurt they always have to use very unconventional means to convey the patients to nearby hospitals, so this was a great breakthrough for the school.</p>
      <p>Prof. Nyarko expressed optimism that the relationship between the two institutions in developing capacity in offshore training would continue to grow.</p>
