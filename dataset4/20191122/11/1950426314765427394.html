      <p>The former vice president, who has a history of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/10/04/joe-biden-explodes-over-question-about-sons-ties-to-ukraine-im-not-going-to-respond-to-that/">refusing</a> to discuss issues realting to his family, was asked by a reporter from Fox News to comment on court documents released Wednesday in an Arkansas paternity case lodged against Hunter Biden.</p>

Hunter Biden, for his part, has denied fathering the child since the suit became became public.</p>
