      <p>Flight 113 took off from Los Angeles International Airport at 11:45 a.m. local time but had to make an emergency landing because of a "technical problem" in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, <a href="https://www.philippineairlines.com/AboutUs/newsandevents/palstatementonpr113laxmnlflight">according to a statement from Philippine Airlines</a>.</p>
      <p>The airline said all 342 passengers and 18 crew members were safe and were able to disembark using regular airstairs.</p>
      <p>"We greatly appreciate the calmness and patience of our PR113 passengers, who cooperated well with our cabin crew during the flight and the emergency landing," Philippine Airlines said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Andrew Ames watched the incident and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-los-angeles-airplane/philippine-airlines-777-makes-emergency-landing-at-los-angeles-airport-idUSKBN1XV2KY">told Reuters</a>: "It almost looked like backfire flames from a motorcycle or car."</p>
      <p>It is not immediately clear what the exact cause of the technical problem in the engine was.</p>
      <p>GE Aviation, the company that makes the engine for the Boeing 777, said it was aware of the incident and was "working with the airline to determine the cause of the event and to promptly return the aircraft to service," according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>Boeing is under scrutiny following the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-timeline-history-full-details-2019-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">deadly crashes</a> involving its 737 Max aircraft, which killed a combined 346 people, led to questions over the plane's design, and left the aircraft grounded across the world.</p>
      <p>Training standards, regulatory oversight, and pilot experience have also been called into question following the scandal.</p>
