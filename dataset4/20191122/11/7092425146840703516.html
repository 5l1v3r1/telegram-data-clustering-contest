      <p>Sharing a sweet snap of husband Wes holding the tot's hand, Rosanna said: "Pure, true love I've been Sophia's mum for almost 24 hours and while she's spent the majority of it asleep, I've mostly stayed up staring at every inch of her!</p>
      <p>"Thank you all so much for the gorgeous messages to welcome her into the world - someday she'll know just how loved and longed for she is."</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old said the pair were "completely besotted" with their little girl as they thanked fans and pals for their kind words.</p>
