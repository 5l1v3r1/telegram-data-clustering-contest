      <p>We’re always interested in testing new input devices, especially computer mice, even more so if you take into account Apple’s widely reported keyboard woes and the fact that customers are now free to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/06/24/how-to-use-a-mouse-on-your-ipad-with-ipados/">connect a mouse to their iPhone or iPad</a>. That’s why we thought we’d take a closer look at Logitech’s Pebble M350 mouse in a new YouTube video by iDownloadBlog’s Harris Craycraft, who wonders whether it could file as the quietest portable mouse on the market.</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, you wouldn’t be wrong if you said that the biggest feature of this portable mouse is its quietness, which takes away from that sharp clicking sound of a regular mouse in favor of a more muted click that’s about the loudness of Apple’s trackpad, maybe even quieter than that. But that’s not the only cool feature that this particular mouse brings to the table so best thing you watch Harris’s video embedded that I’ve embedded right ahead.</p>

      <p>With iPadOS and iOS 13, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/06/03/mouse-input-ipados/">Apple has enabled</a> customers to connect a wireless or wired mouse to their iOS device, but that’s <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/23/ios-13-mouse-ipad/">more of an accessibility feature</a> than a true productivity boost.</p>
