      <h1>Ireland's Euro 2020 Playoff Path Confirmed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:17:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:17</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Redmond</a></address>

        <b>The Republic of Ireland’s Euro 2020 playoff path was confirmed at a draw on Friday morning. If they are to reach the tournament, they will have to come through two away games.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland failed to qualify directly for Euro 2020, finishing third in qualification Group D behind Switzerland and Denmark, a result that was confirmed on Monday night following a 1-1 draw with the Danes in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side must now navigate a play-off next spring. They will play Slovakia away on Thursday, March 26 in a one-leg semi-final. The winner of that tie will play either the winner of the other semi-final in Path B, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Northern Ireland, in a final on Tuesday, March 31.</p>

      <p>That was all known ahead of Friday’s draw in Nyon, Switzerland, but it has now been confirmed that Ireland – should they reach the playoff final – <i>will have <b>NOT</b> home advantage</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So, if Ireland beat Slovakia away, they will play away to either Bosnia or Northern Ireland in a final on March 31. The winner will advance to <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/euro-2020-seeding-ireland/">Euro 2020</a>. So, it could be the Republic of Ireland versus Northern Ireland in Windsor Park for a place at the tournament.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland’s task looks difficult, and you can currently get odds of 4/1 for them reaching the Euros.</p>

      <p>Ireland is one of 12 co-hosts for the tournament next summer as Euro 2020 will be staged in 12 cities throughout Europe – London, Dublin, Glasgow, Rome, Bilbao, Amsterdam, Budapest, Baku, Munich, Copenhagen, Bucharest, and St Petersburg. Dublin will host four games – three group games and a last-16 tie.</p>
      <p>Should Ireland qualify, they will play two group matches in the city and a third in Bilbao against Spain. McCarthy’s team are guaranteed to be in a group with Spain. They will also be drawn alongside one of France, Poland, Switzerland or Croatia, who are all in Pot 2 for the draw, and one of Portugal, Turkey, Austria, Sweden or the Czech Republic, who are in Pot 3.</p>

      <p>As Ireland and Spain are both host nations, <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0253-0d7f8240ecb7-b63cbbe97026-1000--wembley-to-stage-uefa-euro-2020-final/?referrer=%2fuefaeuro-2020%2fnews%2fnewsid%3d2151146">they will not be drawn alongside another host nation</a>. However, Ireland must first qualify for the tournament before they can worry about the makeup of their potential group.</p>
      <p>The next step for McCarthy’s team is a one-leg semi-final away to Slovakia on March 26. If they come through that, Ireland will play a final away from home on March 31 against Bosnia or Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The full Euro 2020 playoff draw is:</p>
      <p><b>Path A:</b> Iceland v Romania. Bulgaria v Hungary. Bulgaria or Hungary will host the final.</p>
      <p><b>Path B: </b>Bosnia and Herzegovina v Northern Ireland. Slovakia v Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland or Bosnia will host the final.</p>
      <p><b>Path C:</b> Scotland v Israel. Norway v Serbia. Norway or Serbia will host the final.</p>
      <p><b>Path D: </b>Georgia v Belarus. North Macedonia v Kosovo. Georgia or Belarus will host the final.</p>
