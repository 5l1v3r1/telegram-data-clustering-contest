      <p>The first <b>comic</b> book produced by <b>Marvel</b>, a well-known American publisher that promoted characters like Spider-Man and X-Men, was auctioned off, earning a record $ 1.26 million in profits, according to Heritage Auctions.</p>
      <p>"This is a historic copy of a historic <b>comic</b> book," Ed Jaster, <b>auction</b> house senior vice president, said of the book, which was published in 1939 by Timely Comics, which later became <b>Marvel</b>, AFP reported.</p>
      <p>"Without question, this is the granddaddy of all <b>Marvel</b> Comics, without which we would not have the characters and stories we enjoy in today's comics and feature films," Jaster added.<br/>Under the guidance of screenwriter Sten Lee, in the 1960s, <b>Marvel</b> created superheroes that have become emblematic and whose cinema adaptations are making money globally.</p>
      <p><b>Marvel</b>'s first <b>comic</b> was sold in very good condition and well above the 10 cents it cost in 1939.</p>
      <p>The most expensive story in history remains the first issue of Action Comics, published in 1938, in which Superman made its debut. It was sold for $ 3.2 million in 2014.</p>
