      <p>Watch music artists reflect on the 2018 BET Hip-Hop Awards Best New Artist winner.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Jahseh "XXXTentacion" Onfroy's final full-length album, <i><a href="https://empire.lnk.to/BadVibesForever">Bad Vibes Forever</a></i>, is scheduled for release on December 6. A trailer for the late musician's forthcoming project was published on YouTube.</p>
      <p>In the video, Billie Eilish, Trippie Redd, PnB Rock, and more reflect on XXX’s impact. The Grammy-nominated Eilish called Onfroy "a beam of light" and "the most selfless kid" she ever met.</p>
      <p><i>Bad Vibes Forever</i> will also include the previously released singles "Hearteater" and “Royalty” featuring Ky-Mani Marley, Stefflon Don, and Vybz Kartel. The project follows 2018's chart-topping <i>?</i> and <i>Skins</i>. His debut studio album, <i>17</i>, came out in 2017.</p>
      <p>"Music saved me as an individual, because I was literally haunted by myself,” XXXTentacion was quoted saying before he was murdered on June 18, 2018. “As a person, I was lost. It gave me a purpose. Within that purpose, I became able to display my pain for others. Initially, it just felt good. After a while, I wanted to be like a therapist for these kids."</p>
      <p>He continued, "Anyone that was even slightly depressed could feel it. I was doing this for them as much as I was for myself. I gave them something to feed on. I gained attention from networking, marketing myself, and being an idiot on the internet, but the cult following is purely because of the songs.”</p>
