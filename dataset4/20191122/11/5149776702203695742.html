      <h1>Sabri Lamouchi reveals what Nottingham Forest need for a chance of success</h1>
      <h2>The Reds take on Bristol City, who have had the same manager for almost four years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:37:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Head coach Sabri Lamouchi is confident <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> could achieve “big things” with the kind of stability their opponents on Saturday have enjoyed.</p>
      <p>Lee Johnson has been in charge of Bristol City since February 2016, making him one of the longest serving bosses across the Premier League and Football League.</p>
      <p>The Reds, by contrast, have seen three managers this year alone, with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Lamouchi</a> taking up the hotseat in June, following on from Aitor Karanka and Martin O’Neill.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has made a fine start to life at the City Ground, leading Forest to fifth in the Championship table as they return to action after the international break.</p>
      <p>The Robins sit just below them, level on points but separated by goal difference - and Lamouchi says that is an example of the benefit of giving people time.</p>
      <p>“We are two similar clubs. They have invested a lot and have good players,” the Reds chief said.</p>
      <p>“Come next February, their manager will have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/not-been-convincing-challenge-nottingham-3560655">worked with mostly the same players</a> and the same squad for almost four years.</p>
      <p>“With that kind of stability he has been able to build a good project.</p>
      <p>“They have a mission to go up, and they are doing well.”</p>

      <p>Asked what he thought he could achieve on the banks of the Trent if given a similar timeframe, Lamouchi said: “I am sure with this club, this community, these fans and this nice atmosphere, me or another one can build big things.</p>
      <p>“But I am not a dreamer.</p>
      <p>“Before the end of this year we have nine games to play - three next week - I just want to focus on Bristol City, then after that a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-qpr-nottingham-forest-3551517">second away game</a> at QPR, then Cardiff at home, who have changed their manager.</p>
      <p>“My schedule is very, very busy and I just want to focus on the results, on the team and the next game.”</p>
      <p>He added: “For me, if you want to challenge in this league, you need a little bit of stability.</p>
      <p>“With more stability, with quality and with a good philosophy, you have more chance.”</p>
      <p>City have lost just once at Ashton Gate this term, when they fell 3-1 against Leeds United on the opening day.</p>
      <p>It leaves Lamouchi well aware of the challenge his side will face as they look to pick up from where they left off, having registered <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">back-to-back wins</a> against Luton Town and Derby County before the two-week respite.</p>
      <p>“We know it will be tough because they have only lost the first game (of the season) at home,” Lamouchi said.</p>

      <p>“I remember their first game, it was against Leeds. It was a bad start for them - like we had - at home (against West Bromwich Albion), but they haven’t lost another game at home since.</p>
      <p>“We know we will face a good team with good players.The way their manager wants to play is good and they have had some good results at home and away.</p>
      <p>“They are a tough team to play at home, but also away, because they have had some good results.</p>
      <p>“They are a good team with a great manager and good players.</p>
      <p>“We will face a tough game. It is not easy to play there and get a good result.”</p>
      <p>Lamouchi, though, is eager to build some momentum heading towards what can often be <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-championship-promotion-prospects-3556986">a crucial festive period.</a></p>
      <p>“It is important to get as many points as you can, and to be ready physically, but also mentally - to be fresh,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of games to play and some long trips - to Bristol, then back on the bus and then on Tuesday to London for QPR.</p>
      <p>“Now it is just game-recovery, game-recovery.</p>
      <p>“We need to be very clever and manage who plays less or not, to be ready in case we need them.”</p>
