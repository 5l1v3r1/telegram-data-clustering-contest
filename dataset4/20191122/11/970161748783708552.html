      <p>If you like to intersperse your re-watching of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a> films with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> marathons of Tiny House nation, this is your perfect getaway.</p>
      <p>Seriously, it’s an exact combination of those niche interests. It’s almost magical.</p>
      <p>In Malboro, New York (an hour or so outside the city) sits a 300-square-foot house <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/39293306">that’s available to rent through Airbnb</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s your classic tiny house in that it’s pretty small, but it makes the most of its space with a lofted bed and smart design.</p>
      <p>Oh, and as we mentioned, it’s Harry Potter themed. There are Hogwarts pillows and house flags, floating candles, a Snape doll, and copies of The Quibbler and The Daily Prophet.</p>

        <figcaption>There’s a *lot* of Harry Potter stuff (Picture: Raven/AirBnB)</figcaption>

      <p>If you take a nose around you’ll also spot a golden snitch, a spell book (that’s actually a guest book), wands, and copies of the books stacked on the shelves, in case you want to use your mini-break to do a big re-reading.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The home and its location are pretty special too, even for people who aren’t massive Harry Potter fans.</p>
      <p>It’s sat in the back of a farm with plenty of wildlife – guests may spot families of deer, coyotes, and loads of butterflies – so is the perfect escape from a bustling city.</p>

      <p>Despite its size the house feels pretty luxurious, too, able to host four guests. There’s a King-sized bed with a memory foam mattress, an extendable dining table, and a fancy kitchen with all the stuff you need to make a feast.</p>
      <p>Outdoors there’s a fire pit for grilling and cosy furniture so you can swap magical stories as night falls.</p>
      <p>And yes, there is wifi. We know that’s important.</p>

      <p>Dogs, cats, owls, and other animal companions aren’t allowed, though, as there’s a farm dog who isn’t great at being around other animals.</p>
      <p>The tiny house is also a limited popup, so do book soon-ish if you’re desperate for a stay.</p>
