      <p>Eight women and 31 men were found in a refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry in an industrial park.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as -25C if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled before crossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet.</p>
      <p>Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, was charged with 39 counts of manslaughter earlier this month.</p>
      <p>22-year-old Eamon Harrison was also charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, as well as conspiracy to commit a human trafficking and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>Three other people arrested in connection with the incident - two men aged 38 and 46 and a 38-year-old woman - have been released on bail.</p>
      <p>Two people were also arrested in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province after launching an investigation into suspected human trafficking.</p>
