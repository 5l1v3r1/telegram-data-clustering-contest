      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:16:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, Zoe Forsey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge skipped a charity event last night as she couldn't find a babysitter to look after Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>One of the royal kids was reportedly not feeling well and there was nobody who could step in to look after them, so Kate decided to stay home, reports Mail Online.</p>
      <p>However Kensington Palace has not given an exact reason, instead saying Prince William attended the Tusk Conservation Awards alone "due to the children".</p>
      <p>The couple have Norland nanny Maria Borrallo to help them look after their three children, and she lives with the family at Kensington Palace. She joined the household back in 2014 when George was eight months old.</p>
      <p>Kate's parents Carol and Michael Middleton are also very involved in childcare, and recently looked after their grandchildren when the royal couple were in Pakistan on their Royal Tour.</p>

      <p>Not wanting to miss the event all together, Kate and William hosted a reception for nominees at Kensington Palace just a few hours before the main celebration.</p>
      <p>Wearing a Beulah London green dress, the Duchess chatted and laughed with the invited guests and learnt more about what they've been doing.</p>
      <p>Explaining Kate's absence ahead of yesterday's event, a Kensington Palace spokesperson for the palace said: "The duchess is no longer able to attend the Tusk awards due to the children.</p>

      <p>"She will still however meet finalists at a tea at Kensington Palace this afternoon. The duke as patron will attend both."</p>
      <p>Wills arrived at Leicester Square, central London, for the annual Tusk Conservation Awards alone before heading to a reception for nominees at the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
      <p>The Duke, who has been Patron of Tusk since 2005, looked dapper as he arrived to cheers and loud drumming from the UK-based Ghanaian band One Drum.</p>

      <p>He was met by Sir Kenneth Olisa, the Lord Lieutenant of London, before walking the green carpet outside the cinema.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Cambridge gave out three awards called for action on the "clear and urgent" challenge faced by the environment.</p>
      <p>He used his speech closing to praise the "hugely important" work of the nominees.</p>
      <p>He said: "As we approach the start of a new decade, the challenge ahead of us is clear and urgent.</p>
      <p>"Climate change, human population growth, exploitation of natural resources, and habitat loss all pose major threats to the precious balance of our natural world."</p>
