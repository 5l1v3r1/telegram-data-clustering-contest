      <p>Salman Khan and Sonakshi Sinha are all set to return with the third instalment of the Dabangg series. There is a lot of hype surrounding the film. It seems that the hype will now grow even further thanks to the release of the song Yu Karke from the film. Featuring Salman Khan aka Chulbul Pandey and his Rajjo aka Sonakshi Sinha, the song is a classic party number in which the actors are seen flaunting their moves.</p>

      <p>Well, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen Sonakshi in such an enjoyable number. The actress spoke about why she feels such songs are her forte, “After Dhadang Dhang from Rowdy Rathore, Go Go Govinda, and Saree Ke Fall Sa, Yu Karke was another song, where I could let go completely. And in all these songs, Prabhu sir is the common factor. Shooting it was a complete blast and I loved being back in my zone. This kind of song is my USP!!!”<br/><br/>Directed by Prabhudheva, Dabangg 3 is all set to release on 20th December this year.</p>
