      <h2>Not a Telenovela, sadly</h2>

      <p>Have you been following <i>Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries</i>? Well, it's nearly out, and it's one of the last big releases of 2019 (it might be <b>the</b> last big release).</p>
      <p>To celebrate Piranha Games' impending launch, they're doling out free novellas that deal with the narrative before the events of the game. Episodes 1 and 2, The Calm of the Void and Vision's Hunger, are available now, and you can check out future episodes <a href="https://mw5mercs.com/novellas">here</a> as they become available. Randall Bills, who is a huge deal in the <i>BattleTech</i> community going back three decades, penned the stories himself.</p>
      <p>Shifting gears a bit if reading isn't your thing, there's also a new overview video that showcases both gameplay and between-mission-action that you can watch below. <i>MechWarrior 5</i> is getting back to the mission-focused gameplay loop, with the option to take riskier contracts (levels) with higher rewards.</p>
      <p><i>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</i> is due out on December 10 on PC. It'll be an Epic Games Store exclusive, at least for now.</p>
