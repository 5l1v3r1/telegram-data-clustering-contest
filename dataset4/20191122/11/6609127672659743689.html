        <b>YOUTUBER Ninh Ly, who did Rangers and Celtic stadium tours in rival jerseys, has slammed the aggressive abuse from 'predominantly' Gers fans after his controversial video.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week he visited Ibrox wearing a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> shirt before touring Parkhead in a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> top.</p>

      <p>Ly then faced aggressive abuse, in particular from Light Blues supporters, for<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4968978/youtuber-celtic-rangers-racist-dead/"> his controversial stadium tour video</a>.</p>
      <p>In a response video about the backlash, Ly said: "There is a lot of misinterpretation about this topic.</p>
      <p>"At no point did I ever criticise either team's staff or either football club. I actually went on record that I recommended them both.</p>
      <p>"Whilst my video was polarising to some, the vast majority saw the funny side of it and I got praise form both sides.</p>

      <p>"But the negative comments I received have been predominantly from one side of the city.</p>
      <p>"And whether that is typical or not I thought to myself 'Why are the Rangers fans so salty about all of this?'.</p>
      <p>"I actually recommended the Ibrox tour, and I still do, what's the problem?</p>
      <p>"I couldn't understand why they were so salty and aggressive given that most of them hadn't watched the video yet.</p>
      <p>"But them my old friend told me Stan Collymore had retweeted my video. But I hadn't put my video on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Apparently there is a two minute clip of my video that has been cut specifically to make Rangers look really bad and Celtic look really good.</p>

      <p>"Obviously I didn't do this.</p>
      <p>"I wrote an apology to Rangers this morning because obviously this snippet of my 24-minute video has been taken a little bit out of context and is not indicative of my opinion."</p>
      <p>Ly, who runs the Ultimate Bucket List Youtube channel, has also been accused of falsifying his experience in a bid to tarnish Rangers' reputation.</p>
      <p>Some Gers fans have even suggested he was in agreement with Celtic to rank their tour highest and talk-down the Ibrox experience.</p>
      <p>He had ranked the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4970440/celtic-rangers-tour-youtuber-ninh-ly-table-ranking/">Parkhead tour as the second best, behind PSG</a>. With Rangers his ninth favourite stadium tour.</p>
      <p>But Ly has rubbished the fan theories as he set a challenge to Rangers fans.</p>
      <p>He said: "There is no denying the overwhelmingly negative response I had is from Rangers fans and they have accused me of various things.</p>
      <p>"Let me address the things that aren't possible. I've been accused, by Rangers fans, that I'm a compulsive liar and that I made up all of that stuff about Rangers.</p>
      <p>"But let me ask you a question, why would I lie?</p>
      <p>"I actually got an apology from a Rangers fan saying he blared a horn at me and waved his finger. It happened.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore if I was abused by a Celtic fan or punched in the face by a Celtic fan do you not think I would've reported that.</p>
      <p>"I've also been accused of coming to an agreement with Celtic before I came to Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"I don't know where you got that from but it's a conspiracy theory of the tin hat variety.</p>
      <p>"Rangers fans, lets say you're correct. Lets say that I am a compulsive liar. Lets say hypothetically that I fabricated things, the Celtic staff knew I was coming and I wasn't a Rangers fan.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Lets say hypothetically that I came to an agreement with Celtic football club beforehand.</p>
      <p>"Why don't we put it to the test? I challenge you to go to Celtic Park, take the tour in the Rangers shirt and if you show me one shred of video evidence that they will mistreat you I will pull my recommendations of them."</p>
      <p>Youtube star Ly also hit back at the abuse from Celtic fans as he revealed they had also targeted him for the video.</p>
      <p>And he insists the purpose of the video is to shown people what Old Firm fans are really like as he questioned whether anyone would want to support them if they read the comments.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm not saying that Celtic fans are perfect, they most certainly aren't.</p>
      <p>"I've received some backlash from you Celtic folk that is just as bad.</p>
      <p>"I don't want people to look at me, I want them to look at you. I couldn't care less about people looking at me, I couldn't give a damn.</p>
      <p>"But I want people to see what Glasgow football fans are like and how they treat each other.</p>
      <p>"I want people like kids who are choosing their football team to read the comments. Who are they going to pick?</p>
      <p>"Corporate sponsors if they are looking to pick one or the other, who are they going to pick?</p>
      <p>"My final thoughts are that Rangers and Celtic are both excellent football clubs.</p>
      <p>"The stadium tours are very good and the staff treated me nicely in both clubs.</p>
      <p>"Before the video was released, one set of fans were significantly more negative and abusive than the other. After the video released, that multiplied.</p>
      <p>"Would I support Rangers or Celtic after this experiment? No I wouldn't support either team."</p>
