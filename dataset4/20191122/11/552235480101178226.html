      <h1>Airdrie can return to 35-year dominance over Albion Rovers on derby day says legend Mark Roberts</h1>
      <h2>Airdrie ruled over their Monklands rivals for decades and Roberts hoped to see a return in the Scottish Cup this weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:40:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p>When Mark Roberts was wearing the diamond the side from ML6 ran <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/boss-ian-murray-sends-airdrieonians-20912874">Monklands Derby day</a> – and the striker expects the current crop of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ex-rangers-goalkeeper-scott-gallacher-20865329">Airdrie players</a> to hit those heights again.</p>
      <p>The striker was up for the cup back in 2001 as he scored in the 4-1 rout at Cliftonhill in the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Airdrie were flying high in the old First Division as Stuart Taylor, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/airdrie-legend-owen-coyle-believe-12576005">Owen Coyle</a> and Kevin James joined Roberts on the scoresheet for Ian McCall’s team with Rovers in the Third Division doldrums.</p>
      <p>It extended their unbeaten record against their local rivals to 25 years, a streak that would remain unbroken until the 7-2 defeat a decade later.</p>
      <p>With the Diamonds topping the League One table and boasting full-time players the 44-year-old says there are plenty of similarities between now and the decades of dominance.</p>
      <p>He says boss Ian Murray will be wary of conceding an early goal but should “just have too much quality on the day.”</p>

      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/airdrieonians-responded-elgin-defeat-hysteria-20865330">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser:</a> “Airdrie are in a bit of a no-win situation, but that can happen when you are the bigger team in a higher league.</p>
      <p>“You have to be confident in your own ability and that you are better than the players at a lower level.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been on both sides of it as a player when you get a shock in the cup, these things can happen.</p>
      <p>“If you get knocked out by an underdog it can be absolutely terrible so you have to make sure you are doing your job.</p>
      <p>“When I was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/glenmavis-lad-ally-roy-hopes-20677234">playing for Airdrie</a> there was a big gap between us and Albion Rovers.</p>
      <p>“Airdrie are going well so that should be the case again this time around.</p>
      <p>“You need to go in with the mindset that you are above their level, but there can be no messing about.</p>
      <p>“If you lose an early goal it can change everything, but you have got to have the right approach.</p>
      <p>“It will really depend on who scores first. Ian and the Airdrie coaches will be telling the players that; it’s about how they start the game.</p>
      <p>“They will be aware that Albion Rovers will be looking for a wee upset. They will need to be fully prepared for that.”</p>

      <p>Roberts says there will be weight of expectation on the New Broomfield outfit as they look to secure a potential money-spinning tie as Premiership sides enter the competition in the next round.</p>
      <p>He continued: “A derby in the Scottish Cup is always something special. When it’s a league game you don’t get the same feeling as a player.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great chance for both teams to progress and get their chance to play some of the big boys in the next round.</p>
      <p>“The chairman and boards will be hoping to get through, as well as the players having a chance to showcase their talents.”</p>
      <p>The Queen’s Park boss has already faced off against Kevin Harper’s men this term and says they will make it tough for Airdrie to break them down.</p>

      <p>Roberts said: “They scored quite early when we drew with them, and made it really difficult for us to break them down.</p>
      <p>“They were really defensive after that and made it difficult for us but we controlled the game in my opinion.</p>
      <p>“We were confident we would score and that eventually came late on and could have won the game.</p>
      <p>“We dictated the game but they made it tough.”</p>
