      <h1>Billie Eilish Asking Kids Where They Go When They Sleep Is Both Pure and Downright Terrifying</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Billie-Eilish">Billie Eilish</a> appeared on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Jimmy-Kimmel-Live"><b>Jimmy Kimmel Live</b></a> on Thursday night, and her appearance was equal parts sweet and, well . . . terrifying. After sitting down with Jimmy to answer the age-old question of how it feels to turn 18, Billie also participated in a segment where she asked children "When We Fall Asleep Where Do We Go?" to celebrate <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/billie-eilish-grammy-nominations-2020-46924722">her album of the same name receiving a Grammy nomination</a>.</p>
      <p>Billie asks children one by one where they go when they sleep, and it's honestly the purest thing we've watched this week. The kids' answers are varied, with the first child, saying "well, you could pretty much go anywhere," like India, the desert, the mummy times, or into a scary story. This is where things got weird, with the last kid saying he's dreamed of Pennywise dancing. Yep, Pennywise. Then, he tells Billie that Pennywise is actually sitting on her head, right now, eating candy. . . and eating a cat, and a dog, and a fox . . . and a person, while drinking a grandmother, and eating Billie. And if that's not the quickest (and most dark) gear change you've ever heard, well, we don't know what to tell you. Watch the full video above.</p>
