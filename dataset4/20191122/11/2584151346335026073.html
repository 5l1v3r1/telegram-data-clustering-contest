      <h2>Europe’s upper class in race to the bottom.</h2>

      <p><i>Welcome to Declassified, a weekly column looking at the lighter side of politics. You can find it in </i>POLITICO<i>'s weekly print edition and online on Fridays.</i></p>
      <p>Back in the early '80s Adam and the Ants sang: "Prince Charming, Prince Charming, ridicule is nothing to be scared of." Jail, on the other hand, is absolutely terrifying.</p>
      <p>Yes, stepping back from public life is Prince Andrew, the queen's least-bright child (and it's a high bar), in the wake of <i>that</i> BBC interview, which could only have been worse if he had borrowed the Nazi uniform that Prince Harry wore to a party in 2005.</p>
      <p>Andrew is now clearly going to be the winner of the coveted "Worst Royal" award — rumors that the makers of TV's "The Crown" and "Prison Break" are discussing plans to make "The Crown: The Prince Andrew Years" were unconfirmed at the time of going to press — but there are other European contenders.</p>
      <p>Here are a few (from recent history or we'd be here all day).</p>
      <p><b>King Juan Carlos I of Spain:</b> The former Spanish king was pictured in 2012 standing proudly in front of a dead elephant while on a safari in Botswana (there were also photos of him with two dead African buffaloes). Juan Carlos is no stranger to hunting scandals. Six years before the Africa photos, officials were forced to dismiss allegations that he had shot a drunken Russian bear that had been plied with honey and vodka.</p>
      <p><b>Prince Laurent of Belgium:</b> The younger brother of  King Philippe, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-prince-laurent-fight-with-national-government/">Laurent</a> has been feuding with the country's government since at least 2017, when it docked his yearly allowance. The 15 percent cut in his royal salary was punishment for having appeared in naval uniform without government permission alongside Chinese military officials. And on Belgian National Day on July 21, he was caught on camera fiddling on his phone during the national anthem and seemed to snub then Prime Minister Charles Michel by not shaking his hand.</p>
      <p><b>Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia of Italy: </b>The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/italys-dethroned-crown-prince-announces-return-of-royal-family/">heir to the Italian crown</a> announced the “return of the royal family” on Twitter this month, more than seven decades after his grandfather was dethroned at the end of World War II. Di Savoia, a reality TV star who along with the rest of his family was banned from the country until 2002, posted a video with the announcement but later admitted he was advertising for Netflix.</p>

      <p>Thanks for all the entries. Here’s the best from our post bag (there’s no prize except for the gift of laughter, which I think we can all agree is far more valuable than cash or booze).</p>
