      <h1>Ruth apologises to Priscilla Presley after Eamonn serenades her and pretends to be Elvis</h1>
      <h2>Afterwards, Ruth Langsford asked husband Eamonn Holmes whether he had 'been drinking'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:52:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Cringing Ruth Langsford apologised to Priscilla Presley today over her husband Eamonn Holmes' reaction to meeting his idol's wife.</p>
      <p>Eamonn, 59, was overcome with excitement as he announced that they would be interviewing Elvis' wife.</p>
      <p>Before they even asked her anything, Eamonn began singing an Elvis song as Priscilla watched on in bemusement.</p>
      <p>Embarrassed, a flustered Ruth told him to "stop it" as Priscilla asked whether he was ok.</p>
      <p>"Not in front of Priscilla Presley, please!" Ruth exclaimed.</p>

      <p>"It's my only chance!" he insisted as he continue to sing.</p>
      <p>After the interview, Eamonn was desperate to get a picture with her, running around to sit on the sofa with Priscilla and lifting his collar to look like Elvis.</p>

      <p>He then began to serenade her and Ruth jokingly called out: "Security! Tell this man to go away."</p>
      <p>Later, Ruth shook her head and said: "The shame for our children. That poor woman!"</p>
      <p>As Eamonn began crooning once again, Ruth asked him despairingly: "Have you been drinking? This is what I deal with, people!"</p>
