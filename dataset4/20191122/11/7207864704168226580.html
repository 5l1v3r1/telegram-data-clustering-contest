      <h2>The Army is working on new "stealth" uniforms.</h2>

      <p><b>Key Point:</b> Russia claims to have already created radar-proof soldier uniforms.</p>
      <p>First there were stealth fighters that didn’t show up on radar. Now the U.S. Army wants uniforms that allow ground troops to escape the notice of electromagnetic eyes.</p>
      <p>Radar has become an integral part of ground warfare, which makes it that much harder for soldiers to hide on the battlefield. Thus, the Army wants uniforms woven out of a material that will absorb rather than reflect radar waves.</p>
      <p>"Radar absorbing and shielding technology has attracted a growing interest due to the recent advances in enemy electronic warfare and detection capabilities, leaving U.S. forces, especially infantry forces, vulnerable to detection across the electromagnetic spectrum," according to a new<a href="https://sbir.defensebusiness.org/topics?topicId=29384"> Army research solicitation</a>. "Advanced battlefield and ground surveillance radar (BSR/GSR) are readily available in military markets that are highly effective, portable, and automated for large area monitoring."</p>
      <p>Stealth materials already exist, but have been unavailable to the lowly foot soldier. "While there exists a wide variety of radar absorbing material (RAM) composites for shelters and vehicles, there are currently no effective and lightweight wearable options to mitigate GSR detection of a dismounted soldier," the Army notes.</p>
      <p>In particular, the Army wants fabric that will absorb radar waves in the Ku- and X-frequency bands. "Prototypes must demonstrate lab- and field-based capabilities within the X and Ku frequency bands at distances up to 12 kilometers [7.5 miles]," says the Army. Whatever material is devised, the grunts wearing it will be reassured to know that the fabric must be flexible, durable and breathable. It must accommodate temperatures from -30 degrees to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, and withstand wet and humid climates.</p>
      <p>The Army’s radar-proof uniform project comes at a time when scientists have developed<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/20/health/invisibility-cloaks-research/index.html"> "invisibility" cloaks</a>, using material that doesn't interact with radar waves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201608051043977795-russia-stealth-fabric-development/"> Russia says it has already developed</a> radar-invisible uniforms. Better yet, according to Moscow, Russia is working on uniforms that won't only make soldiers invisible, but also<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-militarys-next-big-worry-invisible-russian-soldiers-19493"> germ-free</a>.</p>
