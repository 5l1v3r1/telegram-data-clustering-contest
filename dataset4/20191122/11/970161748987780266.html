      <h1>Canary Wharf and Canada Water evacuated after 'dust storm'</h1>

      <p>Passengers were evacuated from two London Underground stations after a ‘dust storm’ in rush hour this morning.</p>
      <p>Canary Wharf and Canada Water were both shut after the air was filled with dust from a tunnel fan.</p>
      <p>Footage shows passengers covering their mouths as they left the stations in the haze.</p>
      <p>The two stations were closed for about 10 minutes shortly after 9.15am.</p>
      <p>Owen Smith, who was at Canada Water during the evacuation, said he thought there was ‘some sort of gas or smoke’.</p>

      <p>Andrew Leung described the situation as ‘a dust storm’ on Twitter, while someone called Temi wrote: The jubilee line is MAD this morning. &amp; Canary Wharf &amp; Canada Water are closer due to fire alarms’.</p>
      <p>A Transport for London (TfL) spokeswoman said: ‘We were doing testing of fans in the tunnels.</p>
      <p>‘It inadvertently created a dust cloud so we evacuated the stations.’</p>
      <p>Both stations have reopened now.</p>
