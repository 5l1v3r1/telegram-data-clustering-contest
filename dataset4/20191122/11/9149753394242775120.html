      <h1>Crucial Ballistix is having early Black Friday deals on its memory kits</h1>

      <p>Aside from your graphics card, memory is the easiest thing to upgrade. Just swap out the old RAM for the new RAM and ta-da, you're done. If you're looking for something that's on the less-expensive side of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday PC gaming deals</a> and don't care about Corsair's RGB lighting or G.Skill's diamond-crusted RAM, Crucial Ballistix has got your simple, no-thrills preference covered.</p>
      <p>You can get 32G (16GB x 2) DDR4 2666MHz CL16 for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XRBS4Y5">£102.99</a>, or £19.26 off the original price, which is the cheapest we've ever seen this exact kit go for on Amazon. Crucial Ballistix is also offering a single stick of 16GB DDR4 2666MHz CL16 for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XC44MJN">£51.40</a>, or £9.50 off the original price, and the white version of its 32GB (16GB x 2) DDR4 3000 MHz CL15 for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MD3WDLS">£118</a>, or £31.63 off the original price. Crucial Ballistix also bills this memory kit as "AMD Ryzen ready," but will work with Intel systems, too.</p>
      <p>If you want to spend a little extra money, the 32GB (16GB x 2) DDR4 3000 MHz CL15 is going to offer the most bang for your buck, if you're okay with the color white. However, going with a CL16 timing and 2666MHz speeds won't make a noticeable difference to the naked-eye. Besides, you can always overclock.</p>
