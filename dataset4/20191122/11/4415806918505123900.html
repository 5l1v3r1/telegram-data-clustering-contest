      <h1>Ireland face potential trip to Belfast to qualify for Euro 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:23:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Ireland will have to win two away games if they are to qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The draw, which was made at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, this morning, gave home advantage in the Path B Play-Off final to the winners of .the semi-final between the hosts Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>
      <p>and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>One of 16 countries contesting the play-offs, Ireland already knew that, as one of the lower-ranked sides, they would be playing away in their semi-final, against Slovakia, on Thursday, March 26, 2020, with the venue yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Should Northern Ireland and the Republic win their respective semi-finals, it would mean an ‘All-Ireland Final’ would take place at Windsor Park, five days later, on Tuesday, March 31.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's men enter the play-off after finishing third in their group: behind Switzerland and Denmark and ahead of Georgia and Gibraltar.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Scotland must beat Israel and the winners of Norway vs Serbia if they are to progress to the finals that will take place across the continent next summer.</p>
