      <p>Lille are unhappy with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> over his decision to take Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> as part of his new-look backroom team.</p>
      <p>Mourinho replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> as manager earlier this week but the new Spurs boss raided Lille for his new assistant, Sacramento, and Santos, his new goalkeeping coach.</p>
      <p>And Lille manager Christophe Galtier has hit out at Mourinho for taking his coaching staff just days before his side face Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1.</p>
      <p>‘Each has their way of doing things. He called Luis [Campos]. I don’t know if it’s [a knife in the back], but it’s very classy to do things like that… I was annoyed, frustrated because the timing isn’t good,’ said Galtier.</p>

      <p>‘Each will judge the way things are done. What’s most important is that I agree with the decision the president took.</p>

      <p>‘To be totally transparent, my president informed me of the situation and told me he would let Joao and Nuno go.</p>
      <p>‘After a long talk, I understand his decision.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a shame, the timing is very bad.</p>
      <p>‘That’s how football is these days but what can he do against two people who want to leave and exit the project for live something else? He gave them that possibility. He could’t do anything else.’</p>
