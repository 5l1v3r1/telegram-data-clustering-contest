      <p>A Vietnamese man has been recognised by Guinness World Records as having the world’s most valuable whisky collection.</p>
      <p>The world-beating collection belonging to Viet Nguyen Dinh Tuan, a businessman in Ho Chi Minh City, has been valued by experts at Rare Whisky 101 at a “hammer price” of £10,770,635.</p>
      <p>An extra valuation of £13,032,468 was made, adding a 21% buyers premium if it was to be sold through a UK auctioneer such as Sotheby’s.</p>

      <p>After collecting whisky for more than 20 years, Mr Viet said it had become his “life’s passion”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Every spare moment I get, I’m searching auction sites and trading websites to find famous and rare whiskies from around the world.</p>
      <p>“Clearly this requires a lot of patience and no shortage of tenacity but I’m proud of my efforts.</p>
      <p>“As for my collection, I have no intention of selling any of it. Not one bottle.</p>
      <p>“In fact, I’ll continue to hunt for more old and rare bottles and add to and enrich it.”</p>
      <p>He added: “My first reaction was one of surprise. However, I’m really happy and feel honoured to be recognised by Guinness World Records as the owner of the world’s most valuable whisky collection.</p>
      <p>“It feels like an acknowledgement of all my hard work and dedication over the past 20 years.”</p>
      <p>Mr Viet is believed to be one of possibly three collectors in the world to own all three variants of the Macallan 1926 bottling – Fine and Rare label, the Peter Blake label and the Valerio Adami label.</p>
      <p>A bottle of Fine and Rare sold recently for £1.2 million.</p>
      <p>His collection also holds one of only 12 bottles of the oldest Bowmore ever released – with a similar bottle fetching £300,000 at auction recently – and one of only 24 bottles of the 1919 vintage Springbank, with another similar bottle selling recently for £220,000.</p>

      <p>“It’s a truly stunning example of one person’s 20-year passion and desire to seek out the finest, rarest bottles of whisky in the world.</p>
      <p>“There are certainly reasonably well-known whisky collections around the world which contain far more bottles from a volume perspective.</p>
      <p>“However, from a pure value perspective, we’re confident this collection is head and shoulders above the rest.”</p>
