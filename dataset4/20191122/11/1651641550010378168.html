      <p>After the success of this year’s long-awaited Resident Evil 2 Remake, Capcom is allegedly already hard at work to create a remake of the series’ third outing.</p>
      <p>Revealed by YouTube content creator Spawn Wave and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-3-remake-to-release-in-2020/">corroborated by VideoGamesChronicle (VGC)</a>, it’s now known that the title is in active development.</p>

      <p>With work essentially completed on the impressive RE Engine at Capcom, and with a few key points of Resident Evil 2 being incorporated into the sequel, Capcom should be able to reuse <i>some </i>assets to ease development.</p>
      <p>With Resident Evil 2 Remake selling close to five million units since its release in January, fans have spoken with their wallets. Resident Evil is back in the limelight, and Capcom knows it.</p>
      <p>With the series’ second entry’s remake releasing 21 years after the original, the third entry appears to be following suit. Both sources claim that the title will be releasing next year: the 21st anniversary of Resi 3 would be in September 2020.</p>
      <p>When we reviewed Resident Evil 2 Remake, we gave the title a shining 10/10. As a survival horror title, we felt that the title was the best gaming can offer.</p>
      <p>“In my five years of reviewing video games, I’ve never given a game the full 10-outta-10 rating,” <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-resident-evil-2-raises-the-bar-for-survival-horror-remakes-and-video-games-as-a-whole/">our review reads</a>. “However, Resident Evil 2 raises the bar not just for survival horror games, not just for video game remakes, but for video games as a whole. It’s a complete experience, it’s a terrifying adventure and it is amazing from start to finish. I mean this when I say, I have no actual faults with Resident Evil 2. It’s as close as it gets to a perfect video game.”</p>
