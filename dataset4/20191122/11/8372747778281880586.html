      <p>NORTH FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Online support is growing to save a Southwest Florida landmark from potential demolition.</p>
      <p>According to a Change.org petition, developers have plans to redevelop a shopping center and RV park in North Fort Myers into a senior living community. Several businesses are being forced out, but one in particular has local residents upset.</p>
      <p>The ice cream cone-shaped Twistee Treat shack has been at the location on Pine Island Road at Business 41 since the early 80's, and was a franchise in the original company that went bankrupt in the 90's.</p>
      <p>As of Friday morning, more than 9,000 people have signed the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/lee-county-commissioners-please-don-t-tear-down-north-fort-myers-plaza-especially-a-landmark-ice-cream-restaurant">online petition</a> that organizers hope to present to Lee County Commissioners.</p>
      <p>However, Fox 4 has spoken with the property manager of the site, who says the petition is a farce. Linda Hass says that only the former Buddy's Restaurant is being torn down, and the plaza is being remodeled and upgraded.</p>
      <p>She claims there are no plans to get rid of the Twistee Treat.</p>
