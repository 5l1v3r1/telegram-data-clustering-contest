      <p>Chris Brown’s second child has been born and he took to his Instagram to subtly shared this good news. According to TMZ, his ex, Ammika Harris, gave birth to their son and this will be their first child together.</p>
      <p>Both Chris and Ammika shared cryptic messages on social media Thursday, seemingly announcing the birth of their baby boy.</p>
      <p>Chris posted a pic of himself smiling and looking down at something off-camera with the caption of the date 11-20-19. Right after that, he shared a pic of himself wearing a hoodie with the word “BORN” embroidered on it.</p>
      <p>Harris also alluded to the child’s birth on her Instagram Story, writing “I was in love when I first saw you.” The boy is Ammika’s first child. CB has a 5-year-old daughter named Royalty with Nia Guzman.</p>
      <p>Ammika is an aspiring model and was Chris Brown’s ex before becoming the baby mama. The pregnancy news was revealed earlier this summer in a cryptic Instagram comment posted by Brown.</p>
