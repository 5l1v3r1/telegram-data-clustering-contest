      <p>Heavy and persistent rain is expected across the UK on Saturday with parts of the Midlands that have struggled with heavy flooding set to be hit by another deluge.</p>
      <p>Yellow warnings have also been issued by the Met Office in southwestern England and parts of Scotland, which will be hit by more wet weather.</p>
      <p>The warnings came as two people died after a tree fell on their car in Gloucestershire on Thursday evening.</p>

      <p>The road is expected to stay closed throughout Friday and Gloucestershire Police say the weather is a line of inquiry into the deaths.</p>
      <p>The rain was due to start in south-west England from 12pm on Friday and last until 6pm on Saturday – meaning a deluge for roughly 30 hours.</p>
      <p>About 20-30mm of rain is expected widely in the region, though the up-slopes of Dartmoor in south Devon could see 40-50mm of rain.</p>
      <p>The average rainfall for Devon and Cornwall during November is roughly 135-45mm.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the Met Office added that areas such as Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire will see persistent rain arriving from the south early on Saturday morning, which will last through most of the day.</p>
      <p>According to the Met Office, rain will be heavy at times, especially on hills where the rainfall could also reach up to 40-50mm.</p>
      <p>The region is still recovering from heavy flooding that caused devastation in many communities in the last two weeks.</p>

      <p>On Friday, 19 households evacuated from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire after a landslip during the floods were allowed to return home.</p>
      <p>Some 60 residents had been forced to live with friends, family or in temporary accommodation for more than two weeks while efforts were made to stabilise the cliff face at Berry Hill Quarry site.</p>
      <p>Met Office data up to November 17 shows that Nottinghamshire has seen the most rain of all UK counties compared with the average, having seen 189% of its monthly average already.</p>
