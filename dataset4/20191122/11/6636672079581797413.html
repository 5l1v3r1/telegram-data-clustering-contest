        <b>Arrows Electronics is offering R3 Communications’ Echoring wireless networking products in the EMEA region. Echoring is designed to support reliable, low-latency wireless machine-to-machine (M2M) communications systems.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both industrial IoT or Industry 4.0 require wireless networks with the performance and reliability of existing wired control networks. R3 says Echoring delivers real-time performance levels with latency down to only 1ms, even in industrial environments.</p>

      <p>A range of software, hardware modules, devices and reference designs based on Texas Instruments WiLink 8 Chip with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity is available for integration with existing networks. Industrial communications protocols supported include Profinet, Profisafe, Ethernet, and Safetynet.</p>
      <p>“Industrial automation applications require synchronisation of different devices that, historically, could only be achieved by wired networks,” the firm says.</p>
      <p>“However, Industry 4.0 can place a strain on cabling: machines need to be reached even when moving, scalability requires a more flexible approach than fixed physical links can deliver, and moving parts are more susceptible to maintenance issues.”</p>
      <p>Echoring uses a radio technology, delivering deterministic access, combined with massive cooperation to support reliability levels up to SIL3. It can be integrated with existing industrial hardware and software, helping to preserve previous investments in equipment.</p>
      <p>The security is powered by military security outfit Olympus Sky.</p>
      <p>As part of the agreement, Arrow will be offering a starter kit that allows users to test Echoring’s performance in their own production environment by substituting the kit’s wireless stations for existing Ethernet connections.</p>
