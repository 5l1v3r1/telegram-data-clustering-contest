      <p>What topics have caught the readers’ interest? There’s a Dutch energy harvesting company, improved efficiency of Perovskite solar cells, Qualcomm’s 5G expectations, Intel regaining the semiconductor crown and the travails of WeWork…</p>

      <p><b>5.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/iot-harvesting-firm-gets-another-10m-series-2019-11/">IoT energy harvesting firm gets another $10m in Series A</a><br/>Netherlands energy harvesting chip firm Nowi has added further cash to its Series A funding – from Disruptive Technology Ventures (DTV), which also injected money with the Dutch Government in 2018. “This new $10m series A round of funding enables Nowi to further grow the team and complete the transition from start-up to a mature organisation, while still retaining a majority position in the company,” said Nowi CEO Simon van der Jagt.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/research-news/hot-electron-capture-boosts-perovskite-solar-cells-2019-11/">Hot electron capture boosts perovskite solar cells</a><br/>Hot electron capture would be one way to improve the efficiency of Perovskite solar cells, by directing the energy of those electrons to the external circuit, rather than allowing it to become heat within the semiconductor. Now a team from University of Groningen in the Netherlands and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore think they have seen useful hot electron capture in action, having thought to add the organic wide bandgap compound bathophenanthroline (‘bphen’) to the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.</p>

      <p><b>3.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/uncategorised/716465-2019-11/">Qualcomm expects fast 5G adoption</a><br/>Yesterday, at its analyst day, Qualcomm said there will be between 175 million and 225 million 5G smartphones in 2020, more than 450 million in 2021 and over 750 million in 2022. 5G adoption will be faster than 4G, says Qualcomm, because of demand from China. Qualcomm is expected to have an integrated 5G modem in 2020. Qualcomm sees its growth coming not only from wireless chips but from 5G-associated markets like automotive, computing and IoT.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/intel-back-st-no-1-sony-fastest-grower-2019-11/">Intel to regain crown; Sony grows the fastest</a><br/>All of the top-15 companies are expected to have sales of at least $7.0 billion in this year, the same number of companies as in 2018. Intel is expected to be back on top of the semiconductor league table in 2019, regaining the crown it lost in 2017, predicts IC Insights, while Sony is expected to be the only top 15 company to grow year. The top-15 worldwide semiconductor sales ranking for 2019 is shown in Figure 1.</p>

      <p><b>1. <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/wework-chairmans-email-staff-2019-11/">WeWork chairman’s email to staff announcing lay-offs</a></b><br/>It is expected that WeWork will lay off 4,000 staff with another 2,000 possibly to go later. This is the email about the cuts which WeWork chairman Marcelo Claure sent to staff on Monday: WeWork Team, This coming week is an important one in the future of WeWork. We are marking our 10th anniversary since WeWork broke ground…</p>
