      <p>A couple who posted a creepy looking image of their baby on social media have been congratulated on their "bundle of demonic energy."</p>
      <p>The baby monitor image shows the child lying in the cot, with dark shadows and the photographic flash in the infant's eyes making a scene scary enough to give people 'nightmares'.</p>
      <p>Now the parents saying buying the monitor was a 'mistake' after the post attracted more than 400,000 likes and 3,000 comments, as people congratulated them on their 'bundle of demonic energy'.</p>
      <p>The parent had captioned the picture: "We got a new video baby monitor and I think that was a mistake," reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/parent-buys-baby-monitor-regrets-20906739">Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>After one wrote: "Is your baby baptized? If so, might want to try it again. First time clearly didn't take," the parent then brilliantly replied: "We did but it turned the water to blood, the priest started climbing up the walls, it was a whole thing."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Can you return it? The baby, I mean return the baby."</p>

      <p>A third replied: "Throw the whole kid away."</p>
      <p>In an attempt to calm everyone down, the parent then posted a follow-up photo to show their son is nothing to be scared of in daylight - and failed miserably.</p>
      <p>The Photoshop job (we hope) also went down a storm as one replied: "OMG this made me laugh harder than the original, which I didnâ€™t think could be topped."</p>

      <p>Others added their own spooky experiences, including a mum who 'couldn't sleep' after being freaked out when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mum-cant-sleep-after-seeing-20652968">she spotted a ghostly figure curled up in bed</a> beside her son.</p>
      <p>After some brave investigating she discovered what had been really lurking in her child's room.</p>
      <p>It turned out what she had initially mistaken for a 'ghost' was actually a picture of a baby on the label of her son's mattress.</p>
      <p>The image wouldn't normally visible in the bed, but her husband had recently changed the sheets and forgotten to replace the mattress protector. Oops.</p>
