        <b>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer feels no extra pressure with highly rated Mauricio Pochettino on the market following this week's shock exit from Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The powers that be at Old Trafford have been long-term admirers of the Argentinian, who followed a promising stint at Southampton with an impressive reign in north London that peaked with June's Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked just 171 days later following a disappointing start to the season, with Solskjaer's predecessor Jose Mourinho swiftly appointed by the north Londoners.</p>
      <p>The United boss has welcomed the Portuguese' return to the Premier League and claims to be unruffled by Pochettino's place in the market.</p>
      <p>"Sorry to disappoint but it's not going be about Jose or Mauricio," Solskjaer said at the start of his press conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>"I can start with it's good to have Jose back definitely - especially for you guys, maybe for me because you can talk and write about everything else."</p>
      <p>Solskjaer continued: "And for Mauricio, it's always sad when one of your colleagues, a good man, you lose your job before Christmas. It's never nice to see so I just wish him all the best.</p>
      <p>"In football you can never be surprised at anything, or you can't be shocked at anything. For me, I've just got to focus on us."</p>

      <p>Asked if United links to Pochettino brings pressure, Solskjaer added: "No, it doesn't bother me at all. I've got the best job in the world and I am sure if you're in a job or if you're out of a job and you're a manager, you'd want this job.</p>
      <p>"So, it doesn't really matter, whatever happens around it. I've got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I speak with Ed (Woodward, executive vice-chairman), speak with the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward and that doesn't change if some other clubs change their managers."</p>
      <p>Solskjaer leads his side to Sheffield United on Sunday following the international break.</p>
      <p>Diogo Dalot, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Eric Bailly remain a way off, but Axel Tuanzebe, Luke Shaw and Nemanja Matic are available for selection following injury lay-offs.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has revealed Marcos Rojo now faces a few weeks out - a similar timescale that United midfielders Scott McTominay and Paul Pogba are expected to miss.</p>
      <p>"Scotty hurt his ankle so he'll be out for still a couple of weeks, I reckon, so he won't be ready for this week," Solskjaer said. "We've lost Rojo, he's injured. Paul is still injured, but we've got Axel, Luke and Nemanja back in training.</p>
      <p>"So we're looking better, we're getting numbers back."</p>
