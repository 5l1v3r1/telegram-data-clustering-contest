      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1.09 patch brings back the Spec Ops 3-star rating system, adds new content</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:55:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare’s big, 1.09 November update is live.</p>
      <p>The latest <b>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</b> patch is currently rolling out on all platforms, at around 12GB on consoles and 20GB on PC. Today’s update adds new content in the form of two new Spec Ops Operations, and a classic Spec Ops mission.</p>
      <p>The three-star rating system, which has been missing since launch, has arrived. Your time in each mission will be graded, and you’ll receive XP and multiplayer unlocks depending on how quickly you clear the different missions.</p>
      <p>In multiplayer, Gun Game has been added, alongside a new Realism mode playlist that spans Domination, Hardpoint, HQ, and Kill Confirmed.</p>
      <p>As far as balance, the patch brings more adjustments to footstep sounds, particularly when walking while aiming down sights, and crouch walking, and the duration of Dead Silence has been fixed. There’s also been a reduction to IFV turret damage radius, which should make Ground War players happy.</p>
      <p>Another balance change touches the FN SCAR 17, which now has slightly faster ADS speed, and takes less of a hit when equipping barrel and bipod attachments.</p>
      <p>Although the update doesn’t touch the infinitely spawning enemies in Spec Ops Operations, it does bring a few welcome fixes and one major change. Completing objectives will now earn your team a munitions box that comes in the form of a care package.</p>
