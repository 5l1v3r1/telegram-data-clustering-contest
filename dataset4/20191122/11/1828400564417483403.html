      <h1>Brett Ormerod column: Blackpool’s returning players have helped them to develop the winning habit</h1>
      <h2>Blackpool have got into the best habit you can get into .... winning games.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:45:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Brett Ormerod</a></address>
      <p>And when you get into that habit, there’s no reason why you can’t be right up there.</p>
      <p>They have won four games in succession and have become very resilient and tough to beat. They can win in style and they can grind out wins too.</p>
      <p>They are already well positioned and the best thing is that the feeling around the camp seems to be that the best is yet to come.</p>
      <p>If you are going to be competing at the top end, it always helps to have someone who is scoring regularly and Armand Gnanduillet is in a rich streak of form.</p>
      <p>He is very unorthodox and difficult to play against. He’s very good in the air, and when he is on his game, he is very effective at this level.</p>
      <p>It’s really been about consistency with Armand, but at the top of his game, he’s a real handful and that’s what you want your striker to be.</p>
      <p>Armand is full of confidence and is putting himself about at the moment.</p>
      <p>The reward is that he’s right up at the top of the scoring charts, but I think it’s no coincidence that Blackpool’s upturn in form has coincided with Sullay Kaikai getting back to his best.</p>
      <p>If they can stay injury-free and keep their best players on the park, I really believe Blackpool can kick on from here.</p>
      <p>I know it’s a squad game, but when you lose your best players, it is only too easy for a team to lose its rhythm.</p>
      <p>Simon Grayson understands this league as well as anyone and knows how to make a team tough to beat.</p>
      <p>Blackpool do seem to be getting their never-say-die spirit back. It was evident in the Peterborough game and they will need that going forward.</p>
      <p>Ipswich away will be really tough this weekend but I’ve seen a lot of games in this division and I don’t think there’s a standout team.</p>
      <p>Early on, Ipswich looked like they could be that team but we’re still waiting for someone to take this league by the scruff of the neck.</p>
      <p>Wycombe are the surprise package but the league is wide open.</p>
      <p>Sunderland haven’t really asserted themselves and it really is up for grabs if any team makes a big push – and there’s no reason why it can’t be Blackpool.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt about the biggest talking point of the week in football and I think everyone in the game was shocked at the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino, who has done everything possible at Spurs bar winning a trophy.</p>
      <p>Tottenham do not pay massive amounts of money compared to some clubs and Pochettino really got them punching above their weight, but nothing should ever surprise you in football anymore.</p>
      <p>After reaching the Champions League final, I would have expected Pochettino to have been given this season to try to develop the club further but no doubt things have been going on behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>I thought immediately that they must have someone else lined up and it was no surprise that, inside 24 hours, Jose Mourinho was appointed.</p>
      <p>His style is not to everyone’s taste but he wins trophies and that is proven – but whether he will at Spurs I’m not sure.</p>
      <p>The international break has seen England qualify in style for next year’s Euros and congratulations to Gareth Southgate, who has got them playing well.</p>
      <p>No matter what team he puts out, they seem to have a confidence and resilience about them and that can only be a positive.</p>
      <p>The cynics will argue this was a group they should have qualified from comfortably, but they have done so in a really positive way and there is a lot of optimism going forward.</p>
      <p>That has continued from the World Cup because what Southgate achieved was to take England’s qualifying form into a tournament. I can only think of a few occasions when that has happened.</p>
      <p>I remember qualifying well under Roy Hodgson, then come the tournament, it all went so wrong with Harry Kane taking corners!</p>
      <p>Southgate has shown he can get the best out of players in qualifying and when it really matters, and he could do something really special with this squad.</p>
