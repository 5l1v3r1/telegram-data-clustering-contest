          <p>During the second day of the first Test of the ongoing Pakistan’s tour of Australia in Brisbane, Australia opening batsman David Warner received a significant reprieve after bails didn’t fall despite the ball touched his off-stump towards stumps.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the last delivery of the 86th over when Warner left an in-swinging delivery from Pakistan fast bowler Imran Khan. In what looked like a confident leave, it wasn’t the case as the ball clipped the off-stump on its way to Pakistan wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan.</p>

                      <p>After the Australian bowlers bundled out the opposition for 240 in 86.2 overs last evening, the visiting bowlers were expected to cause trouble to the hosts’s batsmen but it wasn’t to be as Warner and Burns stood tall on their potential.</p>
