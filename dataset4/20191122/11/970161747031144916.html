      <p>Rachel Riley is standing by her photo-shopped Jeremy Corbyn t-shirt, saying that online hate is ‘the price of awareness’.</p>
      <p>The Countdown host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-sparks-backlash-erasing-jeremy-corbyns-anti-apartheid-message-photoshopped-t-shirt-11192944/">sparked widespread fury when she wore a t-shirt showing a picture of Labour leader Corbyn</a> being arrested at an anti-apartheid protest in 1984, with ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour’ edited onto his sign.</p>
      <p>The original image showed Corbyn holding a placard reading: ‘Defend the right to demonstrate against apartheid; join this picket.’</p>

      <p>After major backlash, Rachel retweeted one of her own posts from October, which said: ‘As we edge towards a December general election, a heartfelt promise: I will do everything in my power to try to ensure my baby, Jewish by blood, will not be born under an antisemitic government.</p>
      <p>‘I hope this will never happen, please use your vote wisely.’</p>

      <p>She’s now added: ‘Thanks for all the lovely messages of support, &amp; all the silent supporters who’ve followed me, means a lot.</p>
      <p>‘Shows how counterproductive nasty pile-ons actually are. I made this promise. I intend to keep it. If this is the price to raise awareness then sobeit. Lots of love.’</p>
      <p>Alongside the original upload, she wrote: ‘I didn’t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn. Please see my pinned thread if you still don’t understand why. #LeadersDebate #LabourAntisemitism.’</p>
      <p>In the recent debate, Corbyn insisted that he has taken action against anti-Semitism in the Labour party, after he was accused of ‘creating a party machine with protects and normalises anti-Semetic ideas and individuals’.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-claims-highlighting-jeremy-corbyns-history-racism-photoshopped-t-shirt-11194388/">the Countdown star has not been backing down.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, although there have been calls for the star to be sacked from Countdown, she doesn’t seem too fazed, as she was spotted<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/rachel-riley-brushes-off-jeremy-corbyn-t-shirt-drama-date-night-pasha-kovalev-11200033/"> out on a date night with her husband, Strictly Come Dancing’s Pasha Kovalev.</a></p>
