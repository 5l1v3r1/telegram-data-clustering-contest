      <h1>Scots gear up for Monte Carlo Classic Rally start</h1>
      <h2>Classic rally car enthusiasts have been getting into the spirit of things ahead of the start of the iconic Monte Carlo event in Scotland early next year.</h2>

      <p>A FABULOUS 60s Monte Carlo Mini was joined by a 1968 Volvo Amazon and a 1977 MG Midget as preparations crank up for Scotland to be a starting point for the iconic classic rally.</p>
      <p>The trio of beauties posed before the splendid Glasgow City Chambers this week as examples of the amazing collection of up to 100 cars that will gather in George Square on January 29 next year.</p>
      <p>That’s when crews will set off from the start ramp in front of the landmark building at 7pm for the epic 1300-mile drive to the south of France in the 2020 Monte Carlo Classic Rally.</p>
      <p>The city is the only British start point of seven European cities including Athens, Milan and Barcelona.</p>

      <p>The 1966 Mk1 Austin Mini Cooper S 1275 is an exact replica of the five cars that took the team prize in the 1967 Monte Carlo Rally in the hands of, among others, rally legend Paddy Hopkirk.</p>
      <p>All were known as the LBL cars from their registration plates and the owner of the replica car, Geoff Marr, from Stirling, has managed to repeat that by securing the plate LBL10D for his car.</p>
      <p>He has spent the past four years rebuilding it into a convincing “Works” Monte Mini, even sourcing genuine parts and equipment, including the original Monte Carlo Rally plaque.</p>
