      <p>A man training to become a teacher was over the alcohol limit when a taxi driver saw him driving a damaged car.</p>
      <p>Michael Wood was found at home by police who discovered his car in the garage there with two damaged tyres and scratched bodywork.</p>
      <p>Wood, 30, of Coleridge Avenue, Thornton, pleaded guilty to drink-driving.</p>
      <p>He was disqualified from driving for 15 months, fined £120 with £85 costs and ordered to pay £32 victims’ surcharge.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor, Pam Smith, said a taxi driver reported to police he was driving behind a Fiesta with two badly damaged tyres, on November 2, at about midnight</p>
      <p>Police traced Wood to his home and he told an officer he had hit something but he did not know what.</p>
      <p>A breath test showed 51 microgrammes of alcohol in his body – 35 is the limit.</p>
      <p>Martin Hillson, defending, said his client, who had no previous convictions, had gone for a night out with a woman and parked the car at a car park intending to take a tram home.</p>
      <p>The night did not go well and the woman went off with some friends.</p>
      <p>Wood drank some spirits and returned to the car park intending to put some more money on the car so it could stayed parked overnight.</p>
      <p>Foolishly he succumbed to the temptation to drive home and clipped the kerb as he left the car park.</p>

      <p>Pam Smith,prosecuting, said that Robinson wanted to talk to the woman over her pregnancy. She refused to talk in the pub bar and went into the kitchen and rang the police. Robinson was arrested and admitted what he had done. His lawyer, Robert Castle, told the hearing: “He did not make any threats. He was told by some of her friends she was worried.”</p>
