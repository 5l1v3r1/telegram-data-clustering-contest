      <p>And now his 9 year old song “<i>O Saajna</i>” is part of Ekta Kapoor’s web show “<i>Broken…But Beautiful 2</i>“.</p>
      <p>Penned and sung by Akhil, “<i>O Saajna</i>” is a soulful song.</p>
      <p>“This song has been an integral part of my journey and when I made Ekta Ma’am hear it , she loved the same and said yes in one go. ‘O Saajna’ is a song where no changes have been made, from the lyrics to the music, everything remains the same. Sunny M.R. has done a fantastic job in keeping the vibe and feel same but added some live instrumentation to give it a fresh feel,” Akhil added.</p>
