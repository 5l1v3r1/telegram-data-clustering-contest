      <h1>Could you ski four volcanoes in four days? Introducing Japan's newest extreme winter trip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:29:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/r/rebecca-miles/" target="_blank">Rebecca Miles</a></address>
      <p>Forget sailing across the Atlantic in a zero-carbon yacht or scaling Big Ben as part of Extinction Rebellion, it’s Mabey Ski’s plan to raise awareness of climate change that will pique the interest of skiers and snowboarders the most. </p>
      <p>In conjunction with environmental advocacy group Protect Our Winters UK (POW UK), the tour operator has created a challenge to ski four volcanoes in four days in the increasingly popular destination for winter sports fans, Japan.</p>
      <p>The plan is to fly skiers and snowboarders to the land of the rising sun where they’ll be challenged to hike and ride the four to highlight the impact of climate change and to raise funds for POW UK. </p>
      <p>Open to 30 adventurous and self-motivated skiers and snowboarders willing to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/where-to-ski-on-a-volcano/">hike dormant volcanoes</a> in Niseko, on Japan’s northern island Hokkaido, and tackle steep terrain, the idea is that the challenge will push their physical, mental and emotional limits. </p>
      <p>Based around Niseko, one of Japan’s most popular backcountry resorts <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/lists/good-to-know-before-a-first-ski-trip-to-japan/">famous for its endlessly light powder snow</a>, participants will climb the Annupuri, Iwaunopuri, Shiribetsu and Mt Yotei volcanoes, ski in their craters and ride their steep ridges and open bowls. </p>

      <p>In a nod to the contradiction between tackling climate change and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/new-flight-via-finland-speeds-up-travel-ski-japan/">flying participants to Japan</a>, a 14-hour flight, Mabey Ski will be offsetting their carbon footprint by engaging in a tree-planting project with POW’s partner, Mossy Earth. </p>
      <p>A social enterprise, Mossy Earth provides the opportunity to buy a number of trees, depending on the amount of carbon to be offset. These are then planted to create forests, restore key ecosystems and encourage rewilding, the protection and reintroduction of wild animals around the world.</p>
      <p>Mabey Ski’s founder and CEO, Nickie Mabey, said: “We talk to our guests about climate change and introduce them to POW’s calculator so they know how to offset their carbon footprint. We believe that educating others on an individual basis is more powerful than just planting trees on their behalf.</p>
      <p>“Many people are concerned about climate change but feel overwhelmed with information on how to reduce their impact on the planet. By using a simple tool such as a carbon footprint calculator individuals can learn how much each area of their life contributes to their carbon footprint and start making changes.”</p>
      <p>For example, a return economy flight from London to Sapporo, return airport transfers to Niseko, daily transfers and accommodation for five nights produces approximately 1.7 tonnes of CO2. To offset this, using Mossy Earth’s calculator, seven trees need to be planted, at a cost to the holidaymaker of £51. </p>
      <p>The climate crisis has been top of the news adgenda in the ski industry a lot recently, with calls for skiers and snowboarders to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/why-you-should-trade-a-plane-for-the-train-to-the-alps/">swap air travel for trains</a>, resorts switching to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/the-green-future-of-skiing-the-worlds-first-solar-powered-ski-resort/">solar energy</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/heatwaves-and-droughts-ski-resorts-battle-with-weather/">extreme weather</a> in the mountains and resorts taking steps to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/european-ski-resorts-preserving-vast-amounts-of-snow/">protect slopes and glaciers</a>.</p>

      <p>Lauren MacCallum, general manager at POW UK, said: “Of course there’s a contradiction between raising awareness of climate change and flying to Japan, but that’s just a part of life. As a luxury operator, Mabey Ski would have run this trip anyway but Nickie was keen to bring a fundraising element to it. Our hope is that not only we will raise some cash but the participants will also become advocates for us in the future.</p>
      <p>To increase publicity for the challenge, Mabey Ski has teamed up with Niseko Photography, who have been scouting and shooting the best locations in Niseko for over a decade. Photographers and videographers will be on hand to capture all the action, and the footage will be provided – both to the participants and to POW UK – within two weeks of the challenge. </p>
      <p>A study published in the Nature Climate Change journal in 2018 said that worldwide tourism accounted for eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions between 2009 and 2013, which makes the sector a bigger polluter than the construction industry. </p>
      <p>“At POW UK we’re not asking people to stop skiing altogether, we’re asking people to change other areas of their life. For example, moving your pension to a sustainable and ethical investment portfolio can have a far greater impact that not taking a family holiday,” said MacCallum. </p>
      <p>Nickie said: “Climate change is real and as passionate snow-sports enthusiasts within the travel industry, it’s essential that we act now in order to protect our planet for our future generations. We all need to become more conscientious and encourage more responsible travel in whatever way we can.”</p>
      <p>As well as offsetting their carbon footprint, the four volcanoes in four days challengers will be, where possible, swapping carbon-emitting chairlifts and snowcats for touring skis and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/what-is-splitboarding/">split boards</a> – a small, yet effective way snow-sport fans can make their ski holidays more sustainable.</p>
      <p>Each participant in the four volcanoes in four days challenge will be required to raise at least £500 for POW UK, the UK chapter of Protect Our Winters, which was established in 2007 in the USA by pro snowboarder Jeremy Jones to rally the outdoor community to take action on climate change. </p>

      <p>MacCallum said: “The aim is we’ll raise £15,000, which we plan to use to create an outdoors community syllabus for the Carbon Literacy training course, which is recognised by the UN. We’ll then launch both a physical course and online modules, so we can reach more people – both individuals and companies. </p>
      <p>“This links into POW’s overall strategy as it creates better educated and more effective climate advocates – you can’t advocate for something if you don’t understand it, so this training course will provide the space and knowledge to do that.” </p>
      <p>The trip will take place from February 24 – 29 2020, and costs ¥290,900 (£2,150) per person, including shared twin accommodation in Niseko, daily transport to and from the mountains, professional guides and photographers each day (one guide per four guests), professional videographer capturing the challenge, an onsen excursion, daily meals, lift pass for first day of side-country skiing/riding, touring and avalanche safety briefing, and all photos and video footage.
