      <p>Given the huge success of Resident Evil 2 a Resident Evil 3 remake is inevitable but it may be out sooner than you expect.</p>
      <p>Considering it was just named Ultimate Game of the Year by the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/resident-evil-2-golden-joystick-awards-2019-ultimate-game-year-winner-11165661/">Golden Joysticks</a> and is one of the Game of the Year nominees for The Game Awards 2019, it seems fair to say that the Resident Evil 2 remake has been a success. Especially as its sales greatly exceeded Capcom’s expectations.</p>
      <p>That puts a remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis on the same level as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fifa/">FIFA</a> 21 in terms of dead certs, even though Capcom themselves has never confirmed they’re working on it (although they <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/30/resident-evil-2-remake-hands-on-preview-and-interview-scary-zombies-is-one-of-the-key-aspects-were-pushing-7897243/">have hinted at it</a>).</p>
      <p>But according to YouTuber Spawn Wave the remake is now far enough along that it’s being prepped for a 2020 release.</p>

      <p>There’s not much detail to Spawn Wave’s comments, beyond the fact that it may be unveiled at The Game Awards on 13 December, although he doesn’t seem certain that will happen.</p>

      <p>The reason he’s worth paying attention to though, is that he was the first to leak information about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/24/elden-ring-natural-evolution-dark-souls-says-hidetaka-miyazaki-10038825/">FromSoftware’s Elden Ring</a>, so he’s got a good track record at the moment.</p>
      <p>Resident Evil 2 was released in January but there seems zero chance that Resident Evil 3 could be out that soon, especially as the already announced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/12/new-resident-evil-game-project-resistance-is-a-new-5v1-survival-horror-10726619/">Project Resistance</a> is presumably coming out first.</p>
      <p>That would seem to suggest that a release towards the end of the year is more likely, but there’s no clue as to whether that means it might also be a PlayStation 5 and next gen Xbox title, as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
