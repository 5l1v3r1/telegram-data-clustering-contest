      <p>Immigration has entered the political arena again this week with comments from Wexford by-election candidate Verona Murphy about asylum seekers. She suggested that some might need to be “reprogrammed” and that children as young as three could be manipulated by ISIS. Ms Murphy subsequently apologised for the comments.</p>
      <p>But are attitudes to immigrants, which for so long were perceived as being broadly welcoming, actually changing? And is the system of Direct Provision the best or most humane way to process asylum seekers, particularly in light of protests in various towns about proposed centres in recent months?</p>
      <p>This week Mick Clifford spoke to the chief executive of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Brian Killoran, who offered some unique insights into immigration, the plight of asylum seekers and the efforts of a small group within society to portray immigrants in the most negative light possible.</p>
