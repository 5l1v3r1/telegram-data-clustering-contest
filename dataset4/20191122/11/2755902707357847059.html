      <h1>WATCH: When You Have A PHD In “Thievery”…Bulawayo Lady Performs Amazing “Disappearing Trick” In Shop</h1>

      <p>It seems like the tough times that are currently being experienced across the country have forced some people to become imaginative and highly skilled at alternative means of earning a living. A business owner in Bulawayo recently realised that there are some who seem to have acquired PHDs in thievery.</p>
      <p>In this particular case, a yet to be identified woman who seems to have a PHD in thievery was caught on live camera stealing a can of what appears to be powder milk. Amazingly, she defies all logic as she somehow manages to hide the huge can in her panties and strolls out of the shop nonchalantly, just like any other shopper minding their own business.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, for the business in question, the lady got away with her crime because the video was not being watched in real-time.</p>
