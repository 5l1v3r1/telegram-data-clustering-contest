      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare gets huge 20GB update – here’s what it does</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:21:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author">Oscar Dayus</a></address>

        <b>Another <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> update is available now, developer Infinity Ward has announced, bringing new Spec Ops missions and refreshing the multiplayer mode playlist. The update weighs in at a whopping 20GB on PC.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two new Special Operations, named Harbinger and Brimstone, are included, while a classic Spec Ops mission called Door Kick has also been introduced. Harbinger has you gathering intel on an informant in Verdansk, while Brimstone will see you fighting your way through a trainyard in order to destroy a runaway locomotive laden with explosives.</p>
      <p>On the multiplayer side, there are two new playlists to enjoy. The first is Realism Moshpit, which cycles through Domination, Hardpoint, Headquarters, and Kill Confirmed; the second, meanwhile, is the fan-favourite Gun Game, which removes perks and forces every player to work their way through a suite of different weapons.</p>
      <p>Aside from the new modes and missions, the update contains a number of bug fixes and balance tweaks. The Infantry Assault Vehicle, for example, has seen its turret damage, as well as its damage radius, reduced. The infamous <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/patch-notes-725-nerf">725 shogun</a> is safe from further nerfs for now, however. For more on the new update, check out the official patch notes over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dzy5uc/112219_patch_notes/">Reddit</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s no more news as yet on the rumoured <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/battle-royale-leak">200-person Battle Royale mode</a>, which was unearthed by dataminers just recently. Some previously <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/maps">leaked maps</a> do seem to be coming to fruition at least, after Shoot House, one of those in the original datamine, was added to the game last week.</p>
