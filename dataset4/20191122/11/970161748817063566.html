      <p>The festive season just got sweeter – thanks to the return of one particular cereal.</p>
      <p>Nestle’s Coco Orange Shreddies are back on the shelves – for a limited time only.</p>
      <p>They’re available to buy in Morrisons stores now and are priced at £2 (reduced from £2.75) for a 500g box.</p>
      <p>There’s just one catch – the moreish cereal will only be available until 4 December.</p>
      <p>So you have just under two weeks to grab yourself a box… or five.</p>
      <p>Nestle announced the comeback on the official Shreddies UK Facebook page.</p>
      <p>The post said: ‘You asked for it, so it’s here! LIMITED EDITION Coco Orange Shreddies is back! Get them in Morrisons stores while you can!’</p>
      <p>Cereal lovers were quick to comment on the news of the relaunch.</p>
      <p>One Facebook user commented: ‘What a time to be alive, they’re back’</p>
      <p>Another cereal fan said: ‘Got my 15 boxes this morning. That’s me sorted. Early bird always catches the worm’</p>

      <p>While others were keen to stress that the move should be long-lasting, posting: ‘YESSSSSS! Thank you, please keep it a permanent thing!’</p>

      <p>But the confectionery brand has stressed that the Coco Orange Shreddies will not be heading to the shelves permanently – well, not yet anyway.</p>
      <p>Nestle said: We have brought it back as Shreddies fans tell us that they love our flavour experimenting.</p>
      <p>‘It is again available for a limited time only though, so that our flavour development team can continue to experiment and constantly bring new and exciting flavours to the breakfast tables of Shreddies fans.’</p>
      <p>The festive flavour was last available back in 2012.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope it won’t be another seven years until it comes around again.</p>
