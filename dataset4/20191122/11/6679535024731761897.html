      <h1>Ind vs Ban first day-night Test: Das, Nayeem concussed, axed players come in as substitutes</h1>
      <h2>Mehidy, an off-spinner, will not be allowed to bowl as per the concussion substitute rule</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:15:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Two Bangladesh batsmen — Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan — were retired hurt from the ongoing Day/Night Test against India in Kolkata, forcing the visitors to bring in as concussion substitutes players who had been dropped from the team.</p>
      <p>Both Das and Nayeem were hit by Mohammed Shami snorters and were replaced by Mehidy Hasan and Taijul Islam at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batsman Das was taken to a city hospital for a scan before another Shami delivery hit Nayeem, who was interestingly attended to by Indian team physio Nitin Patel.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, thus, became the first team to make two concussion substitutes in a Test match.</p>
      <p>Mehidy came in as concussion substitute after Das was hit on the opening day of their maiden Day/Night Test.</p>
      <p>However, Mehidy, an off-spinner, will not be allowed to bowl as per the concussion substitute rule. Mehidy, though, did not last long as he was dismissed by pacer Ishant Sharma for just eight runs.</p>
      <p>Das was retired hurt after being hit on his head at the stroke of lunch at the Eden Gardens here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trying to play a pull short off a Shami bouncer, the heavily-lacquered pink ball blazed in and hit his helmet in the forehead region in the third ball of the 20th over. He was batting on 16 then.</p>
      <p>The physio rushed in, conducted a test and he continued batting, responding with a boundary in the next delivery.</p>
      <p>Das hit another boundary in the next over off Ishant and added nine runs before complaining of discomfort. He was next seen walking off the field after a long conversation with the umpire, forcing the end of the first session with the score reading 73 for six.</p>
      <p>Das’ like-for-like substitute Saif Hassan is down with a (split webbing) injury, forcing the visitors to opt for Mehidy as concussion substitute.</p>
      <p>According to the protocol, a proper medical report has to be submitted to the match referee for a concussion substitute</p>
