      <h2>Inspirational new release 'Yes Business Can' aims to help British businesses maximise their potential</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:53:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Masters</a></address>
      <p>There are more than five million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK - many of which were started by people going into business for the first time.</p>
      <p>Launching a new company can be an incredibly daunting and demanding process. But now help is at hand in the form of a new book from Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland.</p>
      <p>The free downloadable guide - called <a href="http://www.yesbusinesscan.com/">Yes Business Can: Start up, Scale up, Go Global</a> - features in-depth insight from some of the top business brains from across the world.</p>
      <p>They discuss everything from securing funding and improving productivity to investing in intellectual property and handling mental health in the workplace.</p>
      <p>Below we've picked five key pieces of guidance shared in the book to help any aspiring entrepreneur...</p>
      <h3>"A comprehensive business plan is one of the most important first steps"</h3>

      <p>Gareth Oakley is Managing Director, Business Banking, at Lloyds Bank. He says your plan should detail the why, the what and the how of your business.</p>
      <p>He explains: "Make sure it’s thorough – it will act as your roadmap to get you from where you are now to where you want to be in the future. The clearer you are about the market for your product or service – that is, the problem you’re trying to solve – the easier it will be to work out exactly how much funding you’ll need.</p>
      <p>"Be clear in your plan about what you want your borrowing to do for your business. Be realistic about your cash flows too – in my experience business owners are naturally optimistic and don’t always plan for the unexpected. But potential funders will want to see that you’ve had the prudence to plan for things that could go wrong. Show that you have contingencies in place, making sure your plan details how you will keep enough cash in the business to cover costs and borrowing."</p>
      <h3>"Starting a business has never been easier"</h3>
      <p>That's according to Max Kelly, Senior Vice President, Strategy at Techstars.  </p>
      <p>He says: "Tech startups can get going with just a handful of dedicated founders: the ‘hacker’ who writes code, the ‘hipster’ who designs the product and the ‘hustler’ who does the sales. </p>
      <p>"Little funding is needed for this small team, but this does not limit the startup’s global ambitions – they will usually launch in their home market and then expand internationally. </p>
      <p>"Corporates are feeling the pressure. Over half the companies that were in the S&amp;P 500 at the turn of the century are no longer there. They are struggling with innovation, which is second nature for startups."</p>
      <h3>"People outside your business are key to entrepreneurial success"</h3>

      <p>Ben Brabyn, Head of Level39, says we have entered a new age of commercial warfare – one where friend and foe can be one and the same.</p>
      <p>He reveals: "At a time when the world is rediscovering borders, entrepreneurs are proving time and time again that they flourish when presented with constraints, blurring boundaries between competitor and collaborator, and rewriting the rules of lead generation, business development and marketing in the process.</p>
      <p>"In the pursuit of entrepreneurial growth, brokerage and reputation are the keys to success."</p>
      <h3>"It pays to take wellbeing seriously in your business"</h3>
      <p>Gillian Connor is Head of Policy &amp; Partnerships at MENTAL HEALTH UK. She says wellbeing is far from being 'nice to have' - but will actually make your business more productive.</p>
      <p>She explains: "You might be thinking: so what? You have a business to run and a livelihood to develop – sacrifices will need to be made. You can catch up on your ‘wellbeing stuff’ later, right?</p>
      <p>"However, we know that good mental health (which is basically about ‘feeling good and functioning well’) is closely linked to optimal productivity.</p>
      <p>"We also know that showing up for work when you’re not well (presenteeism) is a false economy – it’s bad for productivity. In fact, presenteeism is worse than being off work sick, because it prevents you from being your best and delays or even impedes the recovery process.</p>
      <p>"Research by Deloitte found that the cost of people being at work when their mental health was poor was more than double that of sickness absence and staff turnover combined."</p>
      <h3>"Business owners may be missing out on potential revenue increases due to a reluctance to borrow or seek external investment"</h3>

      <p>Fiona Morrill, Economist and Senior Manager at British Business Bank, warns firms could be missing out by sitting still.</p>
      <p>She goes on: "A longitudinal small business survey by the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy found that businesses that use external finance are more likely to grow their business by 20 per cent or more in subsequent years. They are also more likely to innovate and develop new products and services, which could also boost revenue in the longer term.</p>
      <p>"For businesses that are open to using external finance, choosing the most appropriate funding source is important. Whether by providing additional funding for businesses to invest in new machinery or technology, taking on new staff, developing a new product or service, expanding overseas or helping to manage day-to-day cash ow, there are a range of finance options available to help businesses grow."</p>
