      <p>Students, staff and guests of Plymouth Marjon University have come together to discuss ways they can respond to the climate crisis, after Plymouth City Council declared a climate emergency earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The university held a Climate Emergency Forum earlier this month, which saw students, staff and guests unite to 'talk about how the University will respond to the climate emergency'.</p>
      <p>The forum was set up after Plymouth City Council declared a climate emergency and 'acts off the back of an international aim to keep global temperature rises below 1.5Â°C'.</p>
      <p>The Climate Emergency Forum hosted several speakers, including Cal Major, founder of Paddle Against Plastic; Paul Elliott, Low Carbon Delivery Officer with Plymouth City Council; SCOFF, an aquaphonics farm in Modbury; Architype, who spoke about Campus Development Plans; and Plymotion, a Plymouth City Council initiative to encourage and enable people to choose green transport.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the forum, ocean advocate and world record stand-up paddle boarder ('SUP') Cal Major, who is founder of Paddle Against Plastic said: "There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer for these crises that we face."</p>
      <p>Cal, who recently received an honorary degree from Marjon in recognition of her environmental efforts, founded Paddle Against Plastic in 2016 to bring a positive message to the 'plastic pollution crisis,' and to inspire and empower positive change through stand-up paddle boarding adventures.</p>
      <p>Cal said: "We all need to look at the whole picture and see what the best approach is, and see what we can do individually and collectively to make a big difference.</p>
      <p>"We all need to change our attitudes around how we live."</p>
      <p>The forum was planned and hosted by graduate sustainability officer Matthew Tosdevin, who also planted a magnolia tree to commemorate Marjon's declaration of a climate emergency.</p>
      <p>Matthew said: "The climate emergency forum was a great success. Our group workshops have given the Marjon a community a say in how we tackle the climate emergency, focusing on topics such as green transport, waste, and campus energy.</p>
      <p>"We finished the event by planting a tree as a symbol of hope; by the time it reaches maturity, we should be able to reflect back on our success as a community in this moment in making a commitment for a sustainable future.</p>
      <p>"We're now using the ideas from the event to influence our policies and actions moving forward to reach a zero-carbon target by 2030."</p>
      <p>Plymouth Marjon University's Vice Chancellor, Professor Rob Warner, spoke about how the 'university can work collectively to become more sustainable'.</p>
      <p>Professor Warner said: "None of us, regardless of age, should be shrugging our shoulders when future generations ask us what we did when the climate emergency was declared.</p>
      <p>"My hope is that we can all work together at Marjon, to be the eco-community of the future, today."</p>
