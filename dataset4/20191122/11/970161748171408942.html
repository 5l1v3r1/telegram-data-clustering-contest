      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/leonardo-dicaprio/">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is widely regarded as one of the best actors in the world, winning critical acclaim for his roles in The Departed, Wolf Of Wall Street, The Revenant and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jamie-foxx/">Jamie Foxx</a> revealed the 45-year-old was uncomfortable on the set of Django Unchained, as his character had to use racial slurs.</p>
      <p>And, speaking in QT8: The First Eight – a documentary about director <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/quentin-tarantino/">Quentin Tarantino</a>’s career so far – he explained there was a point himself and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/samuel-l-jackson/">Samuel L Jackson</a> had to force their co-star to utter the n-word, on the set of the 2012 film.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In a clip exclusively shared with <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, Jamie recalled: ‘Leonardo DiCaprio had a problem saying the word “n*****”.’</p>
      <p>Imitating the Oscar winner, he continued: ‘[He said] ”Pal, pal, it’s tough for me to say this.”</p>
      <p>‘I remember Samuel L Jackson going, “Get over here, motherf**ker, this is just another Tuesday motherf**ker. I don’t give a f**k about these motherf**kers, look at who I am, motherf**ker.”’</p>
      <p>Charming as ever, Samuel…</p>

      <p>The Ray actor admitted his own words of wisdom led to Leo – who played plantation owner Calvin Candie – blanking him on set the next day.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I said, “Leo, we’re not friends, this is just another Thursday. This is your property. These aren’t humans. This is your property.”</p>
      <p>‘And, when Leo came in the next day, it was literally like… “What’s up Leo? What’s up fam?” He didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>‘Quentin allowed us to really transport back to that time and it was really real.’</p>
      <p>Django is one of Tarantino’s most celebrated films, winning big at the Golden Globes and BAFTAs, with the director also taking home the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.</p>

      <p>But Leonardo has previously spoken out about how tough he found it playing slave-owner Candie – as he was worried about how far to take the character.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Speaking about the role, he confessed: ‘It was this incredibly interesting horrific character. I mean, there was absolutely nothing about this man I could identify with.</p>
      <p>‘I hated him and it was one of the most narcissistic, racist characters I’ve ever read in my entire life.</p>
      <p>‘One of the pivotal moments for me was this initial read through, I wondered if it needed to be this violent and this atrocious to other human beings and it was Sam and Jamie who said, “If you sugarcoat this people are going to resent the hell out of you. You got to push this guy to the outer extreme.”’</p>
      <p>Seeing as Leo famously slammed his hand through glass in a pivotal scene, and kept acting until the cameras stopped rolling, we definitely think he nailed it…</p>
