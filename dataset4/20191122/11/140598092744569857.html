      <h1>Neurological experts insist more research into concussions is needed to better recovery of injured sportswomen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:53:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/fiona-tomas/" target="_blank">Fiona Tomas</a></address>
      <p>Leading neurologists have called for more research into women and concussion in an effort to aid the recovery of sportswomen who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury. </p>
      <p>The differences in post-concussive recoveries between men and women were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/womens-sport/2019/11/22/special-report-damaging-effects-concussion-sportswomen/">laid bare in a special report by <i>Telegraph Sport</i></a>, which underlined how female brain cells were at greater risk of degeneration from a head injury trauma than male brain cells.</p>
      <p>It also shed light on how women are more susceptible to prolonged post-concussive recovery lengths, highlighting the case of Britain's Olympic hockey gold medallist Nicola White, who has been unable to return to the pitch 20 months after suffering a concussion. Several studies conducted in the US have also suggested the influence of oral hormonal contraception and where a woman is in her menstrual cycle may also impact on the likelihood of a female being concussed. </p>
      <p>Reacting to <i>Telegraph Sport’s</i> special report, Peter McCabe, chief executive of brain injury charity Headway, said: “We’ve known for some time that women are at greater risk of concussion, but this latest research looking into whether women are more susceptible at certain times in their menstrual cycle is particularly interesting. However, more research is needed. Further research, that included a greater number of sportswomen would allow for clearer concussion protocols and recommendations.” </p>
      <p>The need for more research on women was echoed by Dr Willie Stewart, whose landmark study at the Glasgow Brain Injury Research Group last month found former male professional footballers are more than three times more likely to die with dementia and other serious neurological diseases. While the research group has studied female brains from victims of domestic violence and vehicle fatalities - both instances in which women are over represented - <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>can reveal the organisation is yet to analyse a single brain from a female athlete.</p>
      <p>“Our study could only be done on male professional footballers because we just didn’t have the numbers in females to be able to pursue it,” said Dr Stewart. “Female organised football is something that is fairly modern in the last couple of decades. To do this properly, you need thousands of players, not the several hundreds of players you might get from that. But undoubtedly, it’s something we want to pursue.” </p>
      <p>“There absolutely needs to be more research with women in respect to concussion,” said Dr Michael Grey, a professor in rehabilitation neuroscience at the University of East Anglia. “We definitely know there are differences in the way women experience concussion. On the research side, there’s a lot we don’t know. </p>
      <p>“But I’m actually less in favour of women-specific protocols and the reason for that is it just groups people artificially. What we need is person-specific rehabilitation protocols. Concussion protocol and post-concussive syndrome that affects people really does need to be specific for the individual.” </p>
      <p>“Of course, there are women-specific issues, but a woman is still a person,” added Dr Grey. “One of the things with concussion is that it may be a single event, but it’s a very complex pathology. No two pathologies are the same necessarily. Yes, we have to have guidelines, but the actual treatment needs to be person-specific. The sex of the individual is just one of those factors.” Dr Grey also reiterated the need for increased awareness regarding the clinical management of sports-related concussion among health professionals - which was one of several key findings in a report published by an All-Party Parliamentary Group for Acquired Brain Injury in October last year. </p>
      <p>Despite acknowledging significant progress had been made in raising awareness of sports-related concussion - particularly in rugby union - understanding the importance of ‘return to learn’ and ‘return to play’ protocols remained poor in the UK, the report concluded. </p>
      <p>Concussion accounted for 20 per cent of all matchday injuries in the inaugural 2017-18 season of the Tyrrells Premier 15s, which does not benefit from World Rugby’s Head Injury Protocol due to its amateur status. The number is expected to be higher as only six of the league’s 10 teams submitted data to the RFU’s 2017-18 injury surveillance report.</p>
      <p>Despite being one of the few governing bodies to acknowledge a female’s increased vulnerability to head injury trauma in its concussion guidelines, the Football Association does not currently record concussion incidents in the Women’s Super League or the Women's Championship. The body hopes to compile future injury trends in the women’s game with its Women’s Performance System, a new computerised notes database launched this season to log player injuries. </p>
