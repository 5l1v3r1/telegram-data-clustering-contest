      <h1>Borderlands 3 Hotfix and Patch 4 notes detail end game character balancing and new content</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:42:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Tuffcub</a></address>
      <p>A new patch for Borderlands 3 has been released and it includes the usual bug fixes and tweaks along with new content and character balancing. Check out the notes below and don’t forget to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/borderlands-3/">check out our Borderlands 3 hub!</a></p>
      <h3>NOTES FOR PATCH 4</h3>
      <h3>NEW CONTENT:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lorelei has recruited the Vault Hunters to destroy a top-secret weapon Maliwan has been developing at their Blacksite. You and your squad should prepare for an extreme challenge because this content is balanced for four players at level 50. You can gain access to the Blacksite via a mission found on <a href="https://borderlands.com/locale-redirect.html?url=%2Fnews%2F2019-09-04-borderlands-3-sanctuary-iii%2F">Sanctuary III 120</a> after completing the main campaign with that character.</li>
        <li>Takedowns feature special rules not found in the rest of the game! Respawning is disabled, so make sure you and your co-op partners get Second Wind or you’ll spectate until the team wipes. If you do die, you’re not out permanently! Die during the first half, you’ll get to rejoin your team if they defeat the Valkyrie Squad. If you’re out the second half, but your team manages to defeat Wotan The Invincible, you’ll get to respawn to enjoy the rewards you didn’t completely earn!</li>
        <li>Make sure your squad is in the session before you throw the switch inside the Air Lock, or anyone who joins after the switch is thrown joins as a spectator!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Mayhem 4</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mayhem 4 is here for players looking for the toughest challenge in the game! Mayhem 4 adds another increase to enemy health, increases the loot drop chances, and adds a set of new Legendaries! Because the health value greatly increased, Mayhem 4 also slightly adjusts the random modifier system. Mayhem 4 will only roll one positive modifier for the player and one enemy bonus modifier. We want players to try different builds without severely hampering their ability to take down enemies in Mayhem 4. <i>Note that Mayhem 1-3 are unchanged.</i></li>
        <li>In addition to increasing enemy health and adjusting the modifiers, Mayhem 4 contains new Legendary weapons and class mods for players to hunt. These new pieces of gear will contribute to new builds and new ways to kill enemies!</li>
        <li>To support Mayhem 4, we changed the Mayhem station slightly. Players will activate Mayhem through the center pillar and increase or decrease Mayhem levels by using the pillars on each side. Looking forward, we will monitor the challenge of Mayhem 4 closely. We’re working hard on Mayhem 2.0, which will add brand new gameplay additions to Mayhem Mode in the future. Until then, we hope you enjoy the challenge and new loot!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Bank Expansion</b>
      </p>
      <p>All characters now begin the game with 20 bank slots instead of 10. The existing Bank SDUs will give everyone a total of 100 available spaces. An additional 10 Bank SDUs are available to purchase in Marcus’s shop on Sanctuary III using the in-game cash currency, each awarding 20 spaces, for a grand total of 300 total bank spaces!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses</b>
      </p>
      <p>All bosses have been updated with new loot pools that give them dedicated Legendary items to drop. Players can now discover which bosses drop their favorite gear and more easily farm their favorite items. Let the hunt begin!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Additional Vending Machines</b>
      </p>
      <p>The following environments have received additional vending machines. They can typically be found before bosses or the mid waypoint in larger environments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Athenas</li>
        <li>Atlas HQ</li>
        <li>Lectra City</li>
        <li>Jakobs Estate</li>
        <li>Voracious Canopy</li>
        <li>Tazendeer Ruins</li>
        <li>The Pyre of Stars</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Target Dummy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Players can take out their aggression, or test their gear, on a Handsome Jack target inside the shooting range on Sanctuary III.</p>
      <h3>END GAME CHARACTER BALANCE</h3>
      <p>For this patch, we adjusted many passives involving companions such as Iron Bear, Digi-Clone, and FL4K pets in general. We wanted to increase their viability for later levels of Mayhem while also targeting some passives that were underperforming compared to some others. Iron Bear saw increases to the base scaling and additional bonuses were added through passives and augments. We allowed some of Zane’s kill-skill bonuses to stack up to two times, increasing their output under certain conditions. FL4K pets also saw some increases over level to their damage so that they didn’t feel underpowered for Mayhem Mode. We are currently happy with the variety of Amara’s builds, but we are always monitoring feedback and will adjust if necessary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Moze</b>
      </p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>FL4K</b>

      <h3>HOTFIX NOTES</h3>
      <p>Hotfixes are separate from the update and applied at the main menu when Borderlands 3 is connected to the internet. Unlike updates, hotfixes are not permanent—they are temporarily stored in memory during the game session and lost upon exiting Borderlands 3. To ensure that you receive hotfixes, make sure that your system is connected to the internet when Borderlands 3 boots up and hang out on the Menu screen until you see the background change (right now, you’re looking for pumpkins)!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Addressed a reported concern that the Legendary Maliwan “Recursion” ricochets sometimes failed to target ghosts</li>
        <li>Adjusted Rampager’s item pool to allow for specific Legendaries to drop</li>
        <li>Addressed a reported concern that “Boom Sickle” sometimes showed incorrect part text.</li>
      </ul>
