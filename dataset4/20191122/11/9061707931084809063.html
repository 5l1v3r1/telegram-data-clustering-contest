      <h2>Fed up resident, who says he's like Victor Meldrew, puts out plant pots next to piles of mess to shame owners</h2>

      <p>A busy street in South Derbyshire has been described as a 'disgusting toilet' because it is plagued with dog mess and vomit.</p>
      <p>Mick Cramp has been left disgusted at the state of the streets in Hatton, particularly Station Road where he lives, as some dog owners continually fail to clear up after their pets and huge piles of sick on the pavements are assumed to be left by those leaving the pubs at either end of the street.</p>
      <p>He says unsuspecting mums pushing children then get it on their pushchairs as they pass by.</p>
      <p>He says the street is the worst one in the village and must be one of the worst in the area.</p>
      <p>Parking is also an issue, particularly near to the Nisa store, with people leaving their <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/in-the-news">vehicles on the pavement</a>, leaving pedestrians having to walk in the gutter.</p>
      <p>The 72-year-old is leading the fight to get something done to clean up the streets in the village once and for all. And he says it's left him feeling like Victor Meldrew as he refuses to let the issue drop.</p>
      <p>Victor Meldrew was the TV comedy character from the hit show One Foot in the Grave known for his constant complaining.</p>
      <p>He has got so fed you with the dog mess, he has taken to marking the piles poo by placing a plant pot next to them in the hope it might shame dog owners into clearing up.</p>
      <p>Mr Cramp said: "I might be Victor Meldrew but someone has got to do it.</p>

      <p>"I have lived in this village for 40-odd years and I don't think it has ever been this bad. I think that it has got a damn sight worse.</p>
      <p>"It is getting in a right state, there was new stuff this morning. Other people are seeing it around the village and are getting fed up with it.</p>
      <p>"It is disgusting. These supposedly responsible animals owners are letting their dogs poo all over the place. There are loads of responsible dog owners who have always got plastic bags on them.</p>
      <p>"They must walk their dogs at night as it is worse in the morning but nobody seems to see them.</p>
      <p>"It is spread all over the village.</p>
      <p>"The dog mess is on the road for the school run for the kiddies and you can see tracks in it where people have gone through it with pushchairs.</p>
      <p>"Some of it is white stuff and it's terrible. I am trying to bring it to someone's attention to try to get something done about it.</p>

      <p>"If people are walking through it all the while it gets worn away by the time the clean team get it."</p>
      <p>Mr Cramp said this is not the fault of the cleaning team as they have other areas to get to as well.</p>
      <p>Any problem he sees he reports to the clerk of the parish council so a record is kept of the problem.</p>
      <p>He said that in some places cars park close to the wall which means people have to walk in the gutter.</p>
      <p>Mr Cramp said: "We have problems with vomit, parking outside Nisa on the road and close to wall so villagers have a job to get past them and have to walk into the flow of traffic.</p>
      <p>"If I see something like that I try to do something about it or try to get someone else to do something about it.</p>
      <p>"I don't always win but if I don't try nobody knows about it."</p>
