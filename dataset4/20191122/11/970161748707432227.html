      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/vinnie-jones/">Vinnie Jones</a> opened up about his late wife Tanya organising plans to celebrate the couple’s 25th wedding anniversary before her death.</p>
      <p>The former footballer’s wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/25/vinnie-jones-breaks-silence-wife-tanyas-death-emotional-message-heavy-grief-10627568/">sadly passed away in July this year at the age of just 53</a>.</p>
      <p>The hardman is now taking part in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">The X Factor</a>: Celebrity, managing to make it through to the semi-finals this weekend. He previously said that he feels Tanya is ‘with him’ when he performs on stage.</p>

      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a>, the X-Men star told hosts <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eamonn-holmes/">Eamonn Holmes</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ruth-langsford/">Ruth Langsford</a> that his wife actually planned a very special surprise for her family to celebrate a momentous anniversary.</p>
      <p>‘She planned [something for] New Year’s Eve,’ Vinnie revealed to the presenting duo. ‘I’m flying everybody over to Los Angeles, I have a house in Palm Springs.</p>
      <p>‘I’m bringing everyone there to celebrate our 25th anniversary, she wanted to put it on. She made all the arrangements. We have to fulfill them.’</p>

      <p>Vinnie was also embroiled in one of the most controversial X Factor moments in years last weekend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/kevin-mchale-eliminated-from-the-x-factor-celebrity-as-simon-cowell-refuses-to-let-vinnie-jones-drop-out-11168924/">after he attempted to quit the competition</a> after finding himself in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>In the bottom two against Glee’s Kevin McHale, the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels star pleaded with Simon Cowell to allow him to exit the competition for McHale to continue.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the music mogul was having none of it and McHale was eliminated.</p>
      <p>Despite the controversy,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/vinnie-jones-confirmed-stay-x-factor-celebrity-trying-quit-simon-cowell-boss-11175520/"> Vinnie has confirmed that he will be returning to the stage</a> this weekend.</p>

      <p>Vinnie previously tugged at viewers’ heart-strings as he took to the stage two weeks ago with a rendition of hits It Must Be Love and House of Fun. During his performance, he tenderly pointed up to the sky and opened his arms out wide.</p>
      <p>The lyrics of the song read: ‘I never thought I’d miss you, half as much as I do, and I never thought I’d feel this way, the way I feel, about you.’</p>
