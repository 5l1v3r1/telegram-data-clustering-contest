      <p>Brazilian <b>President</b><b>Jair Bolsonaro</b> has launched a new political <b>party</b>, world agencies reported.</p>
      <p>The <b>party</b>, Alliance for <b>Brazil</b>, aims to work against "communism, globalism and any ideology that is contrary to natural order," </p>
      <p>"If I had done this sooner, we would have gotten 100 deputies and a senator elected in each state," Bolsonaro said at a formal launch event in a luxury hotel in the capital Brasilia.</p>
      <p>The <b>president</b> has recently quit his former political <b>party</b>, ultraconservative Social Liberal <b>Party</b> (PSL), because of a scandal over the financing of the election campaign.</p>
      <p>In order to compete in future elections, the new <b>party</b> must gather 500,000 signatures in at least nine of <b>Brazil</b>'s 26 states. The lists of signatures must then be verified and confirmed by the Superior Electoral Court.</p>
      <p>The program of the new <b>party</b> states that it prioritizes "respect for God and religion" along with "defending the rights to life, justifiable defense and family" and upholds the right to possess firearms.</p>
