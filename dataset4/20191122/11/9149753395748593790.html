      <h1>Resident Evil 3 Remake is apparently in development</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:40:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p>Following the success of Resident Evil 2 Remake, it looks like Capcom has moved onto its sequel. A report from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBrLDX8SCM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Spawn Wave</a> claims that a remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is currently in development. </p>
      <p>This shouldn't come as a surprise. Even before the launch of Resident Evil 2 Remaster, Capcom said it had <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/capcom-plans-to-explore-more-remakes-following-resident-evil-2/">plans to explore more remakes</a>; plans that were likely solidified after Resident Evil 2's sales of nearly five million. </p>
      <p>Resident Evil 3 originally launched in September '99, so an announcement this September would have been perfectly timed, but it's come and gone with no official word from Capcom. There was less than a two year gap between 2 and 3 the first time around, and if Capcom was planning on a similar cadence, a 2020 release date could be possible.</p>
      <p>If all these remakes aren't doing it for you, Capcom is also working on <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/project-resistance/">Project Resistance</a>, an asymmetrical multiplayer spin-off that sees Mr. X chasing a bunch of teens. It's a pretty big departure for the series, so if you're looking for something a bit more traditional, you'll have to be content with the remakes for now. </p>
