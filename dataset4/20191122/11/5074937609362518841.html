      <p>Kpando (V/R), Nov. 21, GNA - A total of 18,950 cashew seedlings out of 20,000 raised have been distributed to some 2,050 farmers in the Kpando Municipality under the Planting for Export and Rural Development policy, a subsidiary of the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) initiative.</p>
      <p>The beneficiary farmers cultivated a total of 50 acres with high expectations of good yields.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Meet the Press Series in Kpando, Mr Ernest Theophilus Quist, the Municipal Chief Executive, said the Assembly intended to raise 50,000 cashew seedlings by the end of the year and urged the youth to take advantage of the initiative to venture into cashew cultivation to reduce poverty in the Municipality.</p>
      <p>He said Government would continue to support farmers in the Municipality with farming inputs such as subsidised fertilizers and other chemicals with the view of boosting agricultural production.</p>
      <p>Mr. Quist also added that the Assembly was embarking on the provision of farm based startup kits in the form of piggery, poultry, sheep and goats to some 31 youth in the Municipality as part of the Rearing for Food and Export programme.</p>
      <p>He said his outfit was in negotiations with the Ghana Cocoa Board to take over the Board's former warehouse at Tsakpe New Town in Kpando to house equipment like cassava grater, roasting pan for gari and cassava press-up and that a team had been put in place to manage the project.</p>
      <p>Mr Hope Tsifoaka, Municipal Director of Agriculture, Kpando, said 3,600 kilogramme of special rice seedlings (Agra rice) had been distributed to some 1,105 farmers in the Municipality under the special rice initiative and 850 bags of fertilizer also distributed.</p>
      <p>He said 600 bags of NPK fertilizer and 250 bags Urea fertilizer were distributed under the same initiative.</p>
      <p>Mr Tsifoaka said 900 bags of 50 kilogramme Urea fertilizers were distributed to 295 farmers.</p>
      <p>He further said the Department received 78 bags of coconut seedlings from North Tongu and distributed to seven farmers who wanted to undertake cassava cultivation.</p>
      <p>Mr Tsifoaka commended Government for the implementation of the PFJ initiative, saying, it had increased crop yield in the Municipality.</p>
