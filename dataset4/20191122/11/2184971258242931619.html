    <meta property="og:description" content="The Met Office has issued four weather warnings across the UK for Saturday, including parts of north-east England where heavy flooding has caused significant disruption in previous weeks. Heavy and persistent rain is due to start in south-west England from 12pm on Friday and last until 6pm on Saturday – meaning a deluge for roughly 30 hours. About 20-30mm of rain is expected widely in the region, though the up-slopes of Dartmoor in south Devon could see 40mm-50mm of rain. The fresh warnings of heavy rain come just over a week after much of the Midlands and Yorkshire was deluged forcing hundreds to abandon their homes."/>
