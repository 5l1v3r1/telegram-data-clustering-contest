      <p>A senior lawyer in Nigeria, Afe Babalola, has disclosed that the attitude of civil servants in the country made him turn down ministerial appointments twice.</p>
      <p>The renowned lawyer made the disclosure on Thursday, November 21, in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, after he was conferred with an honorary doctor of letters (D.Lit.) by the University of Ibadan, The Nation reports.</p>
      <p>The founder of the Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, explained that turned ministerial appointments down for two reasons.</p>
      <p><i>“I will create instant enmity if I accepted to be a minister. The second reason is that my clients are so many. They protested and felt I would be disappointing them if I accepted to be a minister,”</i> he said.</p>

      <p>Babalola stated that Nigeria is a country with many challenges, but noted that there was still hope for the country especially with the renewed investment in education.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277561-house-directs-minister-nuc-abolish-payment-acceptance.html"> members of the House of Representatives have directed</a> the ministry of education and the National Universities Commission (NUC) to abolish the payment of acceptance fees into tertiary institutions in the country.</p>
      <p>The directive followed the adoption of a motion brought by the lawmaker representing Ahiazu/Ezinihitte federal constituency of Imo state, Chinedu Martins, at the plenary yesterday calling the abolishment of acceptance fees in tertiary institutions.</p>
      <p>Martins said education is a necessary tool for unlocking human potentials and driving national development and the advancement of any nation.</p>
      <p>He also said that education is directly dependent on the number of its citizens who have access to education, especially up to the tertiary education level.</p>
