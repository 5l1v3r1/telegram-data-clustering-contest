      <h1>‘Giannis is Giannis’ as Bucks rip T-Blazers</h1>

      <h3>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo notched a career-high 15 assists in his second triple-double of the season Thursday, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to a 137-129 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.</h3>
      <p>Antetokounmpo added 24 points and 19 rebounds and Eric Bledsoe added 30 points and the Bucks never trailed on the way to a sixth straight win.</p>
      <p>The characteristically confident performance from Antetokounmpo wasn't lost on Portland's Carmelo Anthony, the 10-time All-Star playing his second game for the Trail Blazers since returning from a year-long absence from the league.</p>
      <p>''Giannis is Giannis,'' Anthony said. ''He's a tough check. I thought tonight we actually did a pretty good job. Even though he had a triple-double, when you look at that, it's like 'Oh, he had a hell of a game.' But I thought, for the most part, we were back on him. We loaded up on him. He found some guys, they made some threes, kind of opened the game up.''</p>
      <p>The Bucks made their first seven shots -- including three three-pointers.</p>
      <p>After the Trail Blazers responded with a 12-2 run Milwaukee pulled away, stretching their lead to 72-58 at halftime.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo secured his 16th career triple-double -- notching double figures in three key statistical categories -- midway through the third quarter despite a slow start shooting.</p>
      <p>''I couldn't get going offensively,'' Antetokounmpo said. ''Shots weren't falling and they were showing a lot of crowds.</p>
      <p>''I tried to find my teammates and they were in the right spots. They were able to knock down shots, drive the ball hard to roll hard.</p>
      <p>''That's why I was able to get 15 assists. I just did half of the work and my teammates did the rest.''</p>
      <p>Portland, whose star guard Damian Lillard was sidelined by back spasms, were also without Zach Collins, Hassan Whiteside.</p>
      <p>CJ McCollum led the Trail Blazers with 37 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.</p>
      <p>He was one of six Blazers players to score in double figures with Kent Bazemore adding 22 off the bench and Anthony contributing 18.</p>
      <p>After scoring 10 points on 4 of 14 shooting against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, Anthony connected on six of 15 from the field, draining three three-pointers.</p>
      <p>Anthony said he felt ''more relaxed'' in his second game with Portland, and he thought it was ''definitely a better game'' overall from the Blazers.</p>
      <p>''We played much better as a unit,'' he said.</p>
      <p>Lining up against Anthony offered a sense of ''deja vu'' said Antetokounmpo, whose first career start in the NBA came in a game against Anthony's New York Knicks in December of 2013.</p>
      <p>''I remember that game,'' Antetokounmpo said. ''It's my seventh year now, so time flies. I'm excited I can go against him.''</p>
      <p>Anthony also recalled that game, and a young Antetokounmpo still finding his way in the NBA.</p>
      <p>''I just remember him being out there and trying to figure out what his role was going to be,'' Anthony said. ''He's here to stay now.''</p>
