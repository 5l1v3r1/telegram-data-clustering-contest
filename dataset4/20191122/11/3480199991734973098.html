      <p>Kylie Minogue has said she was terrified during her performance at Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>The pop star said she barely remembers the show at the festival because she was wracked with fear.</p>
      <p>But Minogue said it was a privilege to play the gig and she managed to handle her emotions before “the ugly cry”.</p>

      <p>The singer spoke on The Graham Norton Show about her 2019 performance, which was her second chance to play Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>A cancer diagnosis in 2005 forced the Australian to pull out of the planned concert that year.</p>
      <p>She said: “As it got closer and closer I couldn’t even say the word, I called it the ‘short show’ because I was rapt with fear about the whole thing.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty much a blur, but there are moments I remember like near the end when I was really happy.</p>
      <p>“I was so scared of the event I didn’t think about what would happen after, but the response that it got and the love that it had was amazing. It was utterly surreal, but a great privilege.”</p>
      <p>Minogue brought out Nick Cave and Coldplay’s Chris Martin for the summer show.</p>
      <p>She said returning to Worthy Farm after being forced to pull out more than decade before made the show particularly special.</p>
      <p>Minogue said: “It was extra everything, a real second chance and I wanted to acknowledge that.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t devise a script in my head of what to say and I had to stop myself before the ugly cry, but I think I said enough.”</p>
      <p>The Graham Norton Show airs on BBC One on Friday night at 10.40pm.</p>
