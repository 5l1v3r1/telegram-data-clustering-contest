      <h1>Chocolate lorry fire leads to hundreds of jokes and most of them are terrible</h1>
      <h2>Once everyone knew there were no injuries, people couldn't help themselves</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:35:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Last night a major road was closed when a lorry containing chocolate burst into flames.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/north-west-ambulance-service">Emergency services</a> were called to the huge blaze on the A556, near the M56 towards the M6, at Knutsford to reports that an HGV was on fire.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">North West Motorway Police</a> tweeted to say that the road was blocked just before the motorway due to the chocolate laden lorry fire.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson said: "@HIGHWAYSNWWEST and police currently dealing with an HGV fire on the A556 near to the M56 towards the M6.</p>
      <p>"All lanes blocked, driver safe and well, for info HGV was laden with chocolate."</p>
      <p>A short time later they tweeted a dramatic picture but firefighters quickly brought the blaze under control.</p>
      <p>Luckily, no one was hurt and the driver escaped uninjured, and once that became clear, quick-witted readers piled in with the choccy jokes.</p>
      <p>First there were obvious ones about 'hot chocolate', among them Matthew Dodd on Facebook who said: "I hope those attending took a mug each with them!! Free hot chocolate!"</p>
      <p>Lettie Fearon said: "Bring your own marshmallows."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And then of course there were the chocolate puns that seemed to be endless.</p>
      <p>Kicking things off, Gareth White said: "Apparently the driver had only recently picked up a couple of "Drifters" needing a lift...driver got them out safely, he's been labeled a "Aero, just glad everyone's ok."</p>
      <p>After a moment of apparent reflection Gareth came back with a second offering: "Hope the wagons wheels are ok."</p>
      <p>Rebecca Rose said, somewhat improbably: "I passed that incident on my way to Bournville."</p>
      <p>Steven King decided this one would do: "Hope the driver had a break and had a Kit Kat."</p>
      <p>Lettie Fearon said: "Was the driver a Yorkie man??"</p>
      <p>Danielle Laffan offered up: "Poor driver, he’s Bounty be a bit shaken up after that."</p>
      <p>Barb Jones said: "Be careful, the fire has left the tarmac a bit Crunchie."</p>
      <p>Philip J Crane spotted the potential in the location and offered: "Is it fruit and Knutsford or whole Knutsford?"</p>
      <p>Debra D'Annunzio tried to rein people in as she said: "Time-Out now!! we seem to have gone off Topic!! let’s not Revel in it."</p>
      <p>Kevin Logan said: "Hope this doesn’t have a Ripple on effect.", which sort of works but mainly doesn't</p>
      <p>@jonh64 on Twitter said: "Sure it was a lorry and not a Double Decker?". You can tell from the picture, Jon.</p>
      <p>And finally, on a curiously astronomical note, @jaywoods71 said: "Is really bad the flames, in 20mins reached Mars, 30 mins the Galaxy, now they've reached the Milky Way."</p>
