      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Ishant became the 1st Indian bowler to pick up a 5-wicket haul in Day-night Tests</li>
        <li>Mehidy Hasan is the first player to be used as a concussion substitute in Day-night Tests</li>
        <li>With Imrul’s wicket, Ishant Sharma became the first Indian to take a wicket with a pink ball</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ishant Sharma dominated a splendid performance by Indian pacers to bowl out Bangladesh for a paltry106 on the opening day of the landmark Day-night Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma (5/22) claimed five wickets, Umesh Yadav (3/29) snapped three while Mohammed Shami (2/36) took two. Ishant became the 1<sup>st</sup> Indian bowler to pick up a 5-wicket haul in Day-night Tests as the lanky pacer dished out a superb performance with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Nisar was the first-ever Indian bowler to take a five-wicket haul with the red ball against England at Lord's in 1932. Interestingly, current head-coach Ravi Shastri holds the record of maiden five-wicket haul by an Indian with the white ball when he took five wickets against Australia at WACA in 1991.</p>
      <p>After opting to bat in their maiden Pink ball Test, Bangladesh lost their opener Imrul Kayes to a seaming delivery from Ishant Sharma in the seventh over of the first innings. Ishant delivered a beautiful leg-cutter that swung it to catch Imrul off guard.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh opener asked for a review only for his team to lose it. With Imrul’s wicket, Ishant Sharma became the first Indian to take a wicket with a pink ball.</p>
      <p>Rohit Sharma took a blinder at the second slip as Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque got a thick edge on Umesh Yadav’s delivery that went flying towards Kohli at first slip. After removing Bangladesh skipper, Umesh Yadav struck again on the same over to send back Mohammad Mithun. Mohammed Shami later joined the party to see the back of Mushfiqur Rahim in the 11<sup>th</sup> over.</p>

      <p>After that Ishant accounted for the wickets of Mahmudullah, Nayeem Hasan, Ebadat Hossain and concussion substitute Mehidy Hasan to create history at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Just after lunch, Bangladesh all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz replaced Liton Das as the concussion substitute for the remainder of the Pink ball Test against India after the wicketkeeper copped a nasty blow on his head while batting.</p>
      <p>Mehidy Hasan is the first player to be used as a concussion substitute in Day-night Tests. However, this is the second time that a concussion substitute is being used in a Test in India.</p>
      <p>After bowling out Bangladesh for 106, India openers Mayank Agarwal and Rohit Sharma stepped in the Eden Gardens with a positive attitude. Mayank became the 1st Indian to hit a four in Pink ball Tests when he guided Al-Amin's short delivery for a boundary past point on the first delivery of the innings. In the same over, Rohit played an audacious pull to become the 1st India batsman to hit a six in Day-night Tests.</p>
