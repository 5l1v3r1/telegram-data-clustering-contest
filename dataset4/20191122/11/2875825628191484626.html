      <p>Vinnie Jones has admitted that he feels as though he "owes" Simon Cowell and now wants to win The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity.</p>
      <p>This comes just days after he pleaded the media mogul to let him leave the competition after landing in the bottom two with Kevin McHale.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning today, he said that being a part of the show had stopped him from falling into depression after his late wife Tanya's death.</p>
      <p>Tanya died in July, aged 53, after being diagnosed with melanoma in 2013.</p>

      <p>"He phoned me in Los Angeles and said he wanted me to come on the show," Vinnie said. "To be honest, I owe Aimon a lot."</p>
      <p>He added: "This crazy six, seven or eight weeks has kept my mind off things and kept me focused on work rather falling into a depression and getting on with life.</p>
      <p>Vinnie insisted that it was what Tanya would have wanted.</p>

      <p>Revealing that he didn't see himself as part of the competition, he described himself someone running alongside the other competitors.</p>
      <p>"This to me is great fun. I just felt, last week, Kevin is such a great singer," he said. "This could be a massive impact on his life and his career.</p>
      <p>Confirming that he now wanted to win, he said that he had "obligations" now and that if he won a contract or money that all his proceeds would go to charity.</p>
