      <p>Evanescence have today (November 22) unveiled a brand-new cover of The Chain by Fleetwood Mac.</p>
      <p>The song is featured in Xbox’s Gears Of War 5 video game, and according to vocalist Amy Lee, “was so fun to make. We love Fleetwood Mac and wanted to paint a dark and epic picture with our take on The Chain. The lyrics make me feel the power of standing together against great forces trying to pull us apart, perhaps even from the inside. I really wanted to drive that home in our version, and even made everyone in the band sing by the end of it! We’re beyond excited to share this with you and I’m really looking forward to playing it live.”</p>

      <p>Amy Lee and Within Temptation’s Sharon den Adel excitedly <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/worlds-collide-amy-lee-and-sharon-den-adel-get-together-for-an-epic-conversation/">revealed all to Kerrang!</a> about the Worlds Collide tour, agreeing that both bands complement each other extremely well.</p>
      <p>“We feel like we have our two separate worlds, separate lives across the ocean, but in a lot of ways there are some major similarities,” considered Amy. “And to be able to bring these two worlds together for the first time just seems like a perfect match for both of us. Obviously there are differences, but you want that. You want contrast in the show but it’s cool to be able to see the similarities and embrace those, too.”</p>
      <p>Sharon added that fans have been requesting both bands to tour together for quite some time.</p>
      <p>“Of course, but that often happens with bands who have that overlap in fans,” she said. “They always ask to do something together but maybe they don’t think it would ever come true. It’s a special one. In the past I remember a lot of my friends getting very excited when Megadeth and Metallica did that tour together many years ago. I remember everyone was very hyped up to see two of their favourite bands together, and it’s a similar sort of thing.”</p>
