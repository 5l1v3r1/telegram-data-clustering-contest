      <p>GameCentral describes its hands-on time with the Project xCloud preview and talks to the Microsoft execs in charge of video game streaming.</p>
      <p>This week saw the launch of Google Stadia and the ushering in of a new era of video game streaming as a viable option for mainstream gamers. It didn’t go that well. Interest before the launch was already muted and most of the attempts to review the service, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/google-stadia-uk-review-video-game-streaming-becomes-a-reality-11178888/">including our own</a>, complained about a lack of content and missing features. Stadia should become a lot more interesting once it gets more games and things like YouTube integration, but at the moment it’s hard to get excited about.</p>
      <p>Everything about Stadia at launch feels rushed and there’s one obvious reason for why that would be: Project xCloud from Microsoft. The Xbox streaming service started its preview phase around the same time as Stadia and although it has no official start date, in terms of being open to everyone, it already seems a more exciting prospect than Stadia. Especially when it was announced last week at X019 that it would get access to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-streaming-service-adds-xbox-game-pass-games-11148301/">all Xbox Game Pass games</a> (which in turn got an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/xbox-game-pass-gets-50-new-games-including-witcher-3-final-fantasy-11148170/">additional 50 games</a> added to the service).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The day after X019 we got to speak to Project xCloud bosses Kareem Choudhry and Catherine Gluckstein, who you would have seen talking about it at the livestreamed event. But before that we’d had our chance to try Project xCloud at home. Although, as with Stadia, that’s not as helpful as it sounds because your home, in terms of broadband and distance to the nearest Microsoft data centre will always be different. Although you can try and join the preview yourself if you <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-streaming/project-xcloud">sign-up for it here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Project xCloud review summary</h3>
      <p>The immediate difference between xCloud and Stadia is how much easier it is to get the Xbox service up and running, even though it’s Stadia that’s the paid-for service and xCloud that’s essentially only a beta. Like Stadia, xCloud currently only works on Android smartphones and we enjoyed the irony of using it with a Sony Xperia 5, which is a very good high-end phone (we’d borrowed it) but as long as it has Android 6.0 and Bluetooth 4.0 you can use any device.</p>
      <p>As with Stadia we were testing xCloud with a normal home broadband service from Virgin Media, which runs around 50 Mbps. With that the performance was generally excellent, especially given this isn’t a finished product, with Gears 5 running almost exactly as it does via the Xbox itself and a TV. The game was clearly never designed for such a small screen but it’s still very impressive to see such a high-tech game running via a device that has nothing to do with generating the graphics itself.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>As with Stadia there were a few hiccups, presumably due to momentary fluctuations in our broadband, but particularly in multiplayer the frame rate could sometimes take a nose dive, with lots of screen tearing – although at other times it was fine. Gears 5 seemed to be the worst for that though, with Killer Instinct being surprising stable for a fighting game.</p>
      <p>Considering this is in no way meant to be a finished product (unlike Stadia you don’t have to pay for anything at the moment) it’s all very impressive. However, there are a huge number of unanswered questions about the service, not least that question of price and when it will be coming out of preview. We asked all these questions and more of Choudhry and Gluckstein and you can judge their responses for yourself below…</p>

      <p><b>PR woman:</b> Do you want a quick recap from them, before we start? Did you see last night?</p>
      <p>GC:<b> I’m fine. Someone from Google told me all about it.</b></p>
      <p><b>All:</b> [laughs]</p>
      <p>GC: <b>I imagine you’re pleased with how it all went?</b></p>
      <p><b>KC:</b> It’s always great to get out and tell our story. And we do this for the fans; it was great to see the reaction.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>I’ll try not to mention Google too much but I think it’s obvious they’ve had trouble exciting people over what is a fairly abstract technology. Has that been an issue for you, getting people energised about streaming?</b></p>
      <p><b>KC:</b> I think there’s an approach to how we discuss it. I don’t really talk about how we’re doing it, because the how is actually not so important. The important part is the why we’re doing it. There’s a great experience on the console, these are all fantastic games, and we’re gonna enable you to play them on your phone or tablet now. And I think that’s the key thing that most people respond to.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> I think what people really understand, and what they’ve seen with other forms of content, is that content doesn’t have to be locked to a device. You’ve seen that with music, you’ve seen that with video, and this is essentially the same thing happening with gaming. Because content no longer needs to be locked to a particular device, you can play it on the device of your choosing, and that’s really what our vision is here.</p>
      <p><b>KC:</b> When we go and meet with partners we don’t walk in with a big slide deck and we don’t start with a bunch of strategy. We walk in with a phone and a tablet and hand them their game running on a phone.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>And they hadn’t seen it running on a phone before?</b></p>
      <p><b>KC:</b> No, no. We hand them their game and they look at each other and my favourite is when they’re looking at their own team and they say, ‘Did you work on this? Did you code this up? I don’t understand how this is working.’ So they didn’t have to do a thing, it was all done at our end, and it’s their game, it’s their creative vision exactly as they programmed it and they’re a little bit blown away by what’s happening.</p>
      <p>And what I say to them is, ‘You are playing your game on an Xbox 200 miles away over a really long HDMI cable, it’s really just kind of that simple’. And I’ll admit, I’m gonna go and hand a creator of a game their game on a different platform, that’s a nervous moment for me as a platform technology provider. But they end up loving it and can see what we’re trying to do.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> And the other thing is that when we talk about going and testing in a country like India they see an opportunity to expand their business, because for many of them they’re currently not selling their games in India or in some other countries.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Was India what you were getting at yesterday when you were talking about a major market that doesn’t have a history of using consoles or PC?</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> India is one of the countries we named that we would be extending previews to and it’s a very large gaming country, it’s one of the top five in terms of engagement worldwide, so it’s a very important gaming market but obviously not one that has a strong console history.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>GC: <b>Microsoft are always very keen to talk about getting everyone playing games, but the basic fact is that some people just are fundamentally uninterested. The barriers to entry are not really that high, not for mobile games at least, so why are you so confident you can massively expand the numbers?</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> There are 2.6 billion gamers on the planet. It’s the biggest entertainment activity on any device. And really what we’re trying to do here is to show people different types of content. You’re right, there’s mobile gaming, there’s PC gaming, there’s console gaming, and there are 2.6 billion gamers around the planet who do it. But that’s why we’re confident. Right now, we don’t sell consoles to that many people, so we think there’s an opportunity to interest people with other forms of gaming.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>In order to attract that many people you need as much varied content as possible. But if we’re honest, outside of indie games, that is not what the Xbox is known for. Is that now something you push for within Xbox as a whole, because you need it to make your side of things a success?</b></p>
      <p><b>KC:</b> I think we’re doing a bunch of different things across content. Number one, we’re heavily investing in our first party studios and Phil has also talked about how he’s making trips to Japan, he wants to bring that content. Number two, what we’re doing to bring ID@Xbox [Microsoft’s indie programme – GC] and that’s really our funnel for local content.</p>
      <p>So working on the game development side I see interest in development for Xbox One in regions all over the world. Especially in emerging markets. So I think when we go to a place like India not only are we going to bring them the content we have today but also we attract local content creators so they can get involved as well.</p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> You’re right, of course, it’s about the games. And the games have definitely evolved, as Kareem has said, as we look at different markets. We have some gamers that are more core Xbox gamers and some gamers, as you say, who like a different variety of games. We need to think about that.</p>
      <p>It’s about devices, so right now we’re on Android but we’ve talked about working with a ton of partners to bring it to any device where people want to play games. And the final vector is countries. When you think about those four it’s all about turning the dials to make it work in those four vectors, which is what this multi-year journey is about.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>I say this for purely selfish reasons, as the more diversity we get in terms of the developers the more likely it is they’ll be making something new and interesting.</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> If I were to take this to an ‘all of Xbox’ conversation, we’re doing a tremendous amount just to attract content developers to our platforms. On console, on PC, and with what we’re doing with Project xCloud it actually leverages all of that work. Every single one of the 3,000 games that run on Xbox One today can run in our cloud. That doesn’t mean that the content owner will decide to put it into the programme, but from a technical capability perspective it’s not an issue.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Obviously, the main concern for someone that knows their games is the performance, the latency issues and so on. We’re joking about streaming seeming magical, but I would never have believed this sort of thing would work even… two or three years ago? And yet I’m not aware of some major technology shift that has suddenly made it possible?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> There are some real critical things that have happened, and going back to our three Cs of content, community, and cloud we’re leveraging the Microsoft Azure data centre footprint. The best thing that anyone can do is put hardware as close to you as possible. And Azure having the largest global footprint, that’s a tremendous advantage. So step 1, make sure hardware is as close as possible, because I don’t know how to make the speed of light any faster.</p>
      <p>Step 2 is to partner with all the telecos and network operators to make sure that you’re having a great connection from wherever you are – be it Wi-Fi or be it mobile – to that Microsoft Azure data centre. And then we do everything that we can to make sure you have a consistent experience. So there are a lot of changes going on, but think of it like an iceberg where you only see a very small percentage of it.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>The problem with talking about streaming is that it’s different for everyone. I live in a fairly large town but anyone that’s living more rurally is going to have a very different experience, and I understand that’s a much bigger problem in America. How do you deal with that issue, given it’s something you don’t have a lot of control over?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> I’ll just say that having equity of Internet access is an important issue all round. Like, that’s not specific to game streaming. This is where we get excited for what 5G is gonna do, it’s gonna lower costs, it’s gonna increase the availability, and I think game streaming is one of the many things that’s gonna benefit from 5G rollout, both in established developed countries and also emerging markets like India, the continent of Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, etc.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>My broadband is fairly fast, but it is prone to cutting out for a few minutes here and there, and it’s not uncommon, every few months or so, for it to cut out for a good few hours or so. What happens when I’m playing a game and that happens?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> Well, it depends on a number of different factors. Your game is actually running on a server, and if you lose connectivity we’ll actually keep that game alive, for some amount of time, for you to be able to reconnect quickly. And then we’ve got timeouts that we’re configuring and learning about as a part of the preview to see how they should work.</p>

      <p>GC: <b>You seem to have been quite sensible about saying streaming won’t make consoles obsolete overnight, I assume primarily because of that issue? At what point do you consider things will be stable enough that consoles are no longer necessary? Because I don’t know that it’d ever be 100% reliable?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> There isn’t a global answer to that question, it’s really going to depend on a per user basis. Let’s say you’re sitting there playing at home, natively on your console – a multiplayer match, and your ISP bows out and you lose connectivity. That’s a negative experience for you. If we take that and change it to streaming it’s kind of the same thing. So you’re dependent upon your network connectivity regardless of whether you’re in a streaming world.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Well, if I’m playing a multiplayer game.</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> We really believe this is about choices and conversation, so for someone like you, I’m guessing, a console is the very best way for you to play right now and this is an additional place for you to play. For other people, that have different dynamics, they may be streaming because they just don’t have a console. So this is why we think it’s really important that we put the customer at the centre and we say it’s about choice for them, it’s not about an either or.</p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> There’s an entire generation of kids growing up watching videos only on smartphones.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>I know, it must be awful for them.</b></p>
      <p><b>Both:</b> [laughs]</p>
      <p>KS:<b> There’s a generation of people growing that will probably never own a TV or display.</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> That’s right!</p>
      <p>GC: <b>I love that cinematic experience you get on a screen the size of a postage stamp.</b></p>
      <p><b>Both:</b> [laughs]</p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> So for them the idea of doing something on a small screen… I don’t personally relate to it but it’s quite natural for a huge percentage of the population.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>I know, of course, I’m joking. But if it’s not a replacement for consoles now, when do you think it will be? Are you thinking a few years or after this whole next generation of consoles is over?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> It’s years and years. We’ve already announced our next generation console, it’s launching next year at Christmas.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>So this isn’t something that’s going to take over by the end of the incoming generation?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> These types of predictions, they’re just beyond my personal wall of thought.</p>
      <p>GC: [laughs]</p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> What I truly believe is that there’s room for all. I’ll parallel it to what we saw with the mobile industry. There was console gaming and there was PC gaming and then mobile gaming sprung up. There were a lot of people that liked to declare that mobile gaming would be the end of PC and console gaming but it didn’t happen, there was room for all three. And all three of those markets have all grown at the same time, and I think we’re gonna see the same thing with cloud gaming.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>One thing that does worry me about this is that you always show xCloud off with the phone clipped to the top of the controller, but most people are just going to try and play the game on the touchscreen. Especially if they’re not at home. It worries me that developers are going to be encouraged to create control systems and gameplay mechanics with that in mind. I don’t want to be controlling Gears 5 with a touchscreen and I fear new games being purposefully simplified to accommodate the fact that they might be played on a phone.</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> So you’re asking is this going to drive everything to a lowest common denominator situation?</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Especially in terms of controls, yes.</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> I personally don’t think so. I mean, if you look at so many of the games today, they’re on console and they’re on PC and the game development community has already done a great job tailoring to the specific needs of each of those. Because they know what’s important to their customers.</p>
      <p>And then for the games that you see natively developed across all three platforms, they adapt appropriately. One of the reasons that we decided to start with controllers is because they’re familiar and everyone knows them. And we don’t want to introduce all the variables at once. And there’s a healthy amount of controllers around the world and we think we can expand the audience.</p>
      <p>We are working on touch, we don’t feel like it’s ready yet. So how do we turn a controller into a generic touch overlay on a phone? I don’t think I would ever prefer to use it, but again I think there’s a lot of people that can type an email on smartphone much faster than I can on a keyboard. I don’t know how they do it, I just have to accept the fact they can. [laughs] And so we go back to that concept of choice. I don’t think it’s gonna degrade the experience for someone like yourself, who believes in the purity of a control mechanism.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>GC: <b>Are you thinking of having specific content that does work only or primarily with a touchscreen? Which is perfectly fine by me. Either porting over existing mobile games or creating your own similar titles?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> I’ll give you an example of a title, it’s a first party title, I think we saw this with Minecraft. So Minecraft is already a cross-platform title that supports multiple different input types. We don’t have it in the preview but of course we’re doing all kinds of internal testing. And one of the things we’ve been able to do is light up the native touch controls in Minecraft and it works great on this form factor, because the game’s designed for it from the beginning. So if you look at it from a platform-enablement perspective we’re going to give developers the choice and they’re gonna do the right thing by their customers.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>One thing, which you haven’t spoken about before, but Google has, is streaming allowing for features that would be impossible or difficult on other formats. Although oddly the only firm example at the moment is the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/grids-40-car-races-possible-google-stadia-claim-codemasters-11097246/">40-car races in Grid</a>. Will xCloud also see games with unique features?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> I’ll say… [lots of hesitating and sideways glances at each other] Again, going back to the why as opposed to the how, I’ll get into the how a little bit with you. We’re at step 1, we’re calling it ‘Lift ‘n’ Shift’. Step 2 is what we call ‘Cloud Aware’, where we actually give the titles the ability to detect, at run-time, ‘Hey, am I streaming or not?’ And they can make the appropriate changes. There’s already some titles that are looking at doing that, that API’s [application programming interface] been in our SDK [software development kit] for almost a year now.</p>
      <p>And the next step after that is something called ‘Cloud Native’, where a developer wants to take advantage of the unique aspects of the cloud. We have a lot of first and third parties that are thinking about that, but again, going back to the fact that we think this is a multi-year journey it’s gonna come out over time.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Google were also implying picture-in-picture during their tech demos, and of course there’s Crackdown 3…</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> Yeah, which we’ve done already…</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Well, there was a bit of a difference between the tech demo I saw at Gamescom all those years ago and what was actually released…</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> [laughs]</p>
      <p>GC: <b>So it sounds like you’re implying one or two years away for that kind of stuff?</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> I actually don’t think timing is the most important element, the most important elements are platform readiness and capability, game design and game mechanics, and the business model behind them. Just because you can used unbounded computing in the cloud it doesn’t mean you can build a business on top of it.</p>
      <p>So we need to work, both with first and third parties, to find out what is that right way to enable them to create a unique experience with a business model that’s great for their customers and great for the developer at the same time.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>You’ve already covered this, so I didn’t bother asking it. But one of my initial concerns was that this is all coming to early and that if it doesn’t work well it risks putting everyone off for years. That happens often with technology, particularly in gaming, with motion controls being the obvious example. Is that your thinking behind being so cautious?</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> What I’d say is that we’re being very intentional about how we’re looking at the market and how we’re testing. We’re certainly moving very fast in a number of things that we’re doing and the number of the four vectors that we are testing against. But we do appreciate that when you’re bringing a new way of doing things to market it’s about technology, it’s about customers developing habit, and that takes time.</p>
      <p>If I look at my own consumption of Netflix over the past 20 years, how I viewed videos has changed immensely from putting a DVD into my TV to my PC and now – I know you wouldn’t like it – but I watch most of my TV on my mobile phone. [laughs]</p>
      <p>GC: <b>You’re right, I don’t like it.</b></p>
      <p><b>Both:</b> [laughs]</p>
      <p>CG: <b>But the point is that it’s really important to see these things as points of evolution and that’s why this element of choice is so important, because as you rightly say it takes time for people to develop the habit and for this to become the way that they interact.</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> And for us it’s incredibly important to do this right, as opposed to doing it quickly.</p>
      <p>GC:<b> That’s good to hear. My last question is on the whole idea of integration with Game Pass and how that plays into being the Netflix of gaming. Everyone’s assuming this is going to be paid for via a subscription but you haven’t confirmed that and I’m not sure if you’re just being coy or if that’s because you’ve got some big secret that we don’t expect.</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> We’ve been asked a lot about this and I try to back it up a little bit by saying we manage our Xbox business in a holistic manner across consoles, accessories, physical game sales, and digital game sales… and what a lot of people don’t realise is that we already have a tremendous amount of online infrastructure to support all of that. So when we layer on streaming capability into our business, yes we’re deploying more servers and more hardware but it’s not a brand new notion for us. We’re gonna find out what that right model is for us holistically across all of our interactions with the customer.</p>
      <p>There’s a couple of reason why we jump on the comparison to Netflix, another one being that something that’s incredibly important for us is that, being a platform, anything that we do, it’s gotta be great for our publishing and development partners. And I don’t know that some of the trends that we’ve seen in the video industry has been great for all of the content producers.</p>
      <p>Whereas the business that we’re in – we’ve been in gaming for 40 years and we intend to be in gaming for at least another 40 years – the only way that happens is if our partners succeed with us. Which is why I was so happy that Ken Moss from Electronic Arts chose to be on stage with Project xCloud.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Can you be specific about that example you’re thinking of with video? That’s not really my area of expertise.</b></p>
      <p>KS: Well, I’ll say Netflix has had a very, very successful business and you see all the various content producers kind of shying away from it a little bit. I’m not in the industry, I don’t know the exact dynamics of it, but we want to come up with a model that actually attracts game developers and game publishers into what we’re doing in a mutually beneficial way.</p>
      <p>GC:<b> In terms of ensuring they can make a profit? Because it does make you wonder, given how cheap Game Pass is at the moment and the worry of how long that’s going to last.</b></p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> We believe in the thesis of Xbox Game Pass and we’re just gonna keep going with it. We think it’s a sustainable motion, it’s great for customers, and it’s great for publishers.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>But is that your concern? That developers and publishers have to be able to make money?</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> It’s an ecosystem and it’s absolutely critical that it works for everyone. And part of the learning from the preview is as much for ourselves as for our partners, and that’s why they’re joining us on this journey.</p>
      <p>GC: <b>Okay, that’s great. Let’s leave it there.</b></p>
      <p><b>CG:</b> Awesome.</p>
      <p><b>KS:</b> That was very enjoyable!</p>
