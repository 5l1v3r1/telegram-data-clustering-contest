        <b>Wayne Bennett's track record as England coach will be taken into consideration when the Rugby Football League conduct an inquest into this winter's disastrous Great Britain tour.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bennett's contract with the RFL ran out at the end of the Lions' winless tour of the Southern Hemisphere and chief executive Ralph Rimmer confirmed a decision on the Australian's future will not be made until the new year.</p>
      <p>Before then, Rimmer and RFL director of rugby Kevin Sinfield will lead a wide-ranging review into the tour, with input from all stakeholders including the players and most likely Bennett himself.</p>

      <p>Rimmer insists Bennett remains keen to take England into the 2021 World Cup and that performances on the Lions tour will not be the only factor in the review.</p>
      <p>"We shouldn't forget what Wayne has done up until this point," Rimmer said. "Yes, we had a poor year on the field and nobody can deny that.</p>
      <p>"We all hurt - the players, coaching staff and everybody involved in it hurt - but until this point we have progressed really well. We came very close to a World Cup and we beat the Kiwis last year.</p>
      <p>"We're doing the review now - it's important that it's considered, reflective and not reactionary to come up with the right answers.</p>

      <blockquote>"We'll take until the end of the year and there will be some recommendations from that which will go to the RFL board in the New Year. We want to win a World Cup in 2021 and need to make sure we're on track to do that"<cite>Ralph Rimmer</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"We'll take until the end of the year and there will be some recommendations from that which will go to the RFL board in the New Year. We want to win a World Cup in 2021 and need to make sure we're on track to do that."</p>
      <p>Bennett has been heavily criticised following the Lions' defeats by Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and a Tonga Invitational XIII and fingers have also been pointed at Sinfield, who combines his RFL role with that of director of rugby at Leeds.</p>
      <p>Asked if Sinfield's position with the governing body is under threat, Rimmer said: "No, it's not something we have to consider. Kevin is doing the review with me and that's it."</p>
      <p>Bennett said the absence of a mid-season Test was partly to blame for Great Britain's defeats and Rimmer says talks are ongoing over a fixture for England next June, ahead of the visit of Australia for next year's three-Test series.</p>
      <p>That game is likely to take place in the Southern Hemisphere, with either the Kiwis or Samoa providing the opposition.</p>
      <p>Rimmer, who ruled out a return of the Exiles team, also said midweek fixtures for the Australian tourists in 2020 remain a possibility.</p>
