      <h1>Star Wars: Rian Johnson Talks Toxic Fandom and The Last Jedi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:11:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Duane Richards</a></address>
      <p>Rian Johnson has commented on the "hurricane" of toxicity he experienced after <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-last-jedi/">Star Wars: </a></i><i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-last-jedi/">The Last Jedi</a>.</i></p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/rian-johnson-interview-knives-out-star-wars-last-jedi-1203410899/"><i>Variety</i></a>, Johnson was asked about his experience with the <i>Star Wars </i>fandom, particularly in relation to the departure of <i>Game of Thrones </i>showrunners <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-benioff-weiss-exit-rian-johnson-movies/amp/">David Benioff and D.B. Weiss</a>. "You always have to contextualize how small a part of the fandom that section is. I’m not talking about people who like or dislike a particular movie," he explained. I’m talking about the people who have dedicated themselves to abusing people who are involved in the films. It’s so small, but it gets blown up. Having been in the hurricane for the last two years, I can tell you that 95% of what I get even on Twitter is lovely and thoughtful and engaged, even when people don’t like my movie."</p>

      <p>"Having said that, it’s a problem that every type of fandom is dealing with," he continued. "It’s almost a byproduct of this system that is the internet.”</p>
      <p><i>The Last Jedi</i>, both written and directed by Johnson, revealed a dark side to the <i>Star Wars</i> fandom that included bullying and petitions to reshoot the entire film. It has been theorized by some that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-benioff-weiss-toxic-fandom-departure/">Benioff and Weiss' departure</a> from their proposed <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy was to avoid another bad experience with fans following the overwhelmingly negative reception to the final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>.</p>
      <p>Johnson himself still has another <i>Star Wars </i>trilogy in the works, despite the fan backlash. "I'm still talking to Lucasfilm," he said. "They haven't announced anything."</p>
