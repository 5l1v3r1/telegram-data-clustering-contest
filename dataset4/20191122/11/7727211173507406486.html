      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:35:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Martin Lewis has told This Morning viewers how to get a real 6ft Christmas tree for just £9.</p>
      <p>During his deals segment Money Saving Expert <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/martin-lewis-tells-homeowners-how-17297370">Martin told fans</a> how to get the deal from Ikea.</p>
      <p>The deal tends to be very popular and all people have to do is head to the Ikea store and buy a £29 tree.</p>
      <p>You then get a £20 voucher to spend in store next year.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/martin-lewis-money-saving-expert-17253418">Martin said:</a> "Every year this tends to be very popular. Go into your nearest Ikea and if you buy a £29 real Christmas, you’ll get a £20 voucher to spend at any participating store between Monday 13 January and Sunday 23 February next year.</p>
      <p>"So it’s effectively a £9 tree as long as you’d have spent £20 in the New Year anyway.</p>
      <p>"Officially, it's on till Tuesday 24 December, but in previous years the trees have sold out before this - so go quick if you want one, as it’s likely to be popular.</p>
      <p>"The trees are all of the same variety (Abies Nordmanniana) and they're typically about 170cm (5ft 7in) tall, but do vary in size, and there’s no delivery option, so do think about how you’ll get it home."</p>
      <p>Last year you could get the same deal for £5, so it is an increase of £4 but <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/money-saving-expert-martin-lewis-17236865">Martin still thinks</a> it's a bargain.</p>
