      <p><i>Rockfire Grill at 6583 Pardall Road in Isla Vista<br/></i><b><i>Update by edhat staff<br/></i></b><b><i>November 22, 2019<br/></i></b> <br/>A UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) student was arrested on November 6 on three misdemeanor charges of battery, public intoxication, and fighting in public after allegedly assaulting numerous people in Isla Vista, reports <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/ucsb-student-allegedly-assaults-multiple-individuals-in-isla-vista-while-shouting-homophobic-slur/">The Daily Nexus</a>.</p>
      <p>An edhat reader reported the incident earlier this month stating UCSB sent out an alert to students of a possible hate crime that took place outside Rockfire Grill on Pardall Road. The suspect was described as a white male who got into a fight with another male and called him a homophobic slur while also assaulting two women on the scene.</p>
      <p>Third-year transfer student Tucker Steil was arrested by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and held on a $2,500 bail.</p>
      <p>Numerous witnessed stated the attack appeared to be an aggressive anti-gay attack, but the suspect has not been charged with a hate crime.</p>
      <p>UCSB officials were criticized for not informing students of this incident which prompted the campus-wide notification the following week.</p>
      <p>One of the female victims reportedly sustained a broken hand and a male victim sustained a concussion and broken nose.</p>

      <p>Does anyone have more information on a violent assault and possible hate crime that took place in Isla Vista this week?</p>
      <p>I received a notice from the University stated they received a report of a hate crime and are in connection with the victims. People who apparently witnessed it said last week a white male wearing a UCSB Gaucho shirt beat up a guy, called him the F-word, then assaulted a few girls. This was outside Rockfire Grill on Pardall.  </p>
      <p>Outside of the notice from UCSB and people talking, I haven't seen any information or followup in local news. What's up?</p>
