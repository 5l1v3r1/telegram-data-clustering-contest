      <h1>A Third Season Of ‘Mindhunter’ Is Apparently “On Hold”, Which Wounds Me Deeply </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:44:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p>I’m sorry to say it but talks of <i>Mindhunter </i>season 3 are said to be “on hold” as mastermind <b>David Fincher </b>focuses on his next feature film.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned “on hold” popped up towards the end of an interview with <b>Jonathan Groff </b>in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonathan-groff-balancing-impossibly-bleak-world-mindhunter-beyonce-1255563">The Hollywood Reporter,</a> in which Groff discussed his role as Agent Ford and the show in general. THR reports Fincher is currently working on a Netflix biopic called <i>Mank, </i>based on a script written by his late father, <b>Jack</b>. There aren’t too many details about the movie around but we do know it will focus on <i>Citizen Kane </i>screenwriter <b>Herman Mankiewicz</b>. <b>Gary Oldman</b>, <b>Amanda Seyfried</b>,<b> Lily Collins</b>,<b> Charles Dance</b>, <b>Tuppence Middleton</b>, and <b>Arliss Howard </b>will star.</p>
      <p>He’s also apparently juggling another project, a prequel series to the classic movie <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/chinatown-prequel-series-netflix-david-fincher-robert-towne-1203408719/">Chinatown</a></i> for Netflix. Busy bloke that David Fincher.</p>
      <p>It’s not yet known just like how long <i>Mindhunter </i>will be “on hold” for, but we did wait more than a year and a half for season 2… so, uh, yeah.</p>
      <p>But it’s worth noting / re-noting that Fincher is genuinely set on doing five seasons of <i>Mindhunter.</i> Groff’s co-star <b>Holt McCallany</b>, otherwise known as gentle tough guy <b>Bill Tench</b>, told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/holt-mccallany-mindhunter-season-2-david-fincher-visiting-real-life-killers-1231758">THR</a> as such back in August.</p>
      <p>“He [Fincher] said ‘Listen, are you ready to do this for five seasons? Because even if I fuck it up, it’s gonna go five seasons, and I don’t intend to fuck it up’. So I’d like to think that we will continue, for as long as David is intrigued by telling this particular story.”</p>
      <p>On the bright side, I’ll probably have my life together by the time season 5 comes out. Maybe.</p>
      <p>You can re-binge <i>Mindhunter </i>on Netflix now.</p>
