      <h1>Argos Black Friday Sale Proves to Be Unbelievable for Kammy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:00:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>That's Chris ‘Kammy’ Kamara, in case you're only vaguely aware of the world of football on your periphery.</p>
      <p>He and presenter Olivia Wayne star in a weird little video highlighting some of Argos' Black Friday deals, including £100 off a Lenovo IdeaPad S145, over £100 off a Hitachi 50" 50HK25T74U Smart 4K LED TV, £70 off the BaByliss 2663VU Curl Secret Simplicity, and £20 off Beats by Dre Solo 3 On-Ear Wireless Headphones. The video is peppered with classic Kammy catchphrases - or so all this talk of beavers has lead me to believe.</p>

      <p>"Black Friday is the perfect time to score some great deals, but we know it can be tough for customers to keep up with all the latest price drops; in fact, it’s not dissimilar to the drama of football transfer day," said James Brown, commercial director at Argos, really reaching for even the most tenuous of connections to explain Kammy and Olivia's presence. "So, it was an obvious choice to recruit football news experts, Chris Kamara and Olivia Wayne, to help our customers tackle Black Friday and find the best deals. Just what the gaffer ordered." Whatever you say, James.</p>
