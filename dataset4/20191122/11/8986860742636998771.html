      <p>Swedru-based hiplife musician Patapaa has made a very surprising statement about the entertainment industry.</p>
      <p>According to the “One Corner” hitmaker, there are evil forces in the entertainment industry that are working hard to cause destruction.</p>
      <p>Patapaa explained that there are several things that go on in the entertainment industry therefore artists must be spiritually strong to overcome these evil forces.</p>
      <p>The musician made this comment when he disclosed am unfortunate incident that happened to him a few weeks ago at Tarkwa.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that he was hospitalized after his close friend tried to poison him before going on stage to perform at Tarkwa.</p>
      <p>This comes after there were reports earlier that Patapaa fainted just a few minutes to a show he was headlined to perform.</p>
      <p>The musician was rushed to a nearby hospital and was said to be in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>This, however, confirms Eagle Prophet’s prophecy where he recently revealed that Patapaa will be poisoned by his close friend.</p>
