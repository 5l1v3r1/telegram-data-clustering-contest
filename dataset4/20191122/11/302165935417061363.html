      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 22 — Agriculture and Agro-based Industries Minister Datuk Seri Salahuddin Ayub admitted writing to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad asking for a RM1.4 billion farming tender to be given to the National Farmers Organisation (Nafas).</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said he was merely doing his duty by writing the letter of support to assist Nafas as the tender has yet to be finalised.</p>
      <p>“As long as the tender is still open, anyone can submit their tender, anyone can see me to participate, and I was fulfilling my responsibility by writing that letter of support for Nafas,” he told reporters during a press conference here after opening the Department of Fisheries’ 125th anniversary celebration at the Fisheries Research Institute in Batu Maung.</p>
      <p>He added that as long as the tender was not finalised and it had not been awarded to a successful bidder, he was not wrong to write the letter of support for Nafas.</p>
      <p>He said Nafas is not any normal organisation but one that issues dividends to farmers and takes care of their welfare.</p>
      <p>“It is managed by the ministry for our farmers so do not equate Nafas bidding for the project as for ourselves. This is to benefit the farmers,” he said.</p>
      <p>Salahuddin was responding to allegations by Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong that the former had written to the prime minister on November 7 to request the direct appointment of Nafas for agricultural imports in the paddy sector for a three-year period between 2020 and 2022.</p>
      <p>Labelling it as “dubious dealings”, Wee claimed that several local companies that had won the open tenders placed by Salahuddin’s ministry had seen their tenders cancelled.</p>
      <p>He alleged that the companies were suddenly told that their tenders were cancelled and that the projects were awarded through direct negotiation.</p>
      <p>Salahuddin told Wee to show proof of his allegations.</p>
      <p>“We do everything according to procedure. There is no proof that we cancelled tenders that had been offered,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said all calls for tenders are finalised by the Ministry of Finance so it all depends on the latter.</p>
      <p>“I am not involved in the tender process. I want to explain this so that we are not trapped into thinking that I want to give the project to our cronies,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said when the ministry called for tenders, the rule of law and procedures are followed.</p>
      <p>“We did not break any laws. Everything was done in accordance with the procedures of open tender,” he said.</p>
      <p>He brushed aside Wee’s allegations of a “RM1.4 billion scandal” by pointing out that none of the money went into his personal account.</p>
      <p>“What is a scandal? A good example of a scandal is 1MDB. A scandal is when money is deposited into my account, my wife’s account, my deputy’s account, his family’s account,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said if Nafas were to be given the project, the funds would go directly to the organisation which is managed by the ministry.</p>
      <p>As for allegations that the money from the project that went to Nafas was channelled to the recent Tanjung Piai by-election campaign, Salahuddin denied this.</p>
      <p>He again asked Wee to prove his claims.</p>
