      <p>Video footage shows how onlookers flocked to the scene of a brazen cash-in-transit heist at an intersection on the R566 on the N4 north of Pretoria - hoping to find money.</p>
      <p>National police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said the cash van was travelling from Rosslyn to Silverton when it came under attack on Monday.</p>
      <p>Suspects travelling in three SUVs, and armed with rifles, fired several shots at the cash van’s tyres, bringing it to a halt.</p>
      <p>“The suspects were wearing blue overalls with balaclavas and hand gloves. They approached, pointed firearms, opened the door and took the driver's firearm. </p>
      <p>“The suspects bombed the truck, took an unknown amount of money and fled the scene,” she said. </p>
      <p>A video of the aftermath of the heist showed people scouring the scene of the blast for bank notes.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported and no arrests were made.</p>
