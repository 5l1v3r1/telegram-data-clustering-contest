      <p>In Scotland, minimum unit pricing means that a standard bottle of wine (10 units) cannot cost less than £5 (50p per unit).</p>
      <p>Us down in England have no such rule – yet – and can therefore take advantage of deals and offers that bring the cost of booze down.</p>
      <p>We’re not complaining when we get to the till, but it does make it easier to stockpile alcohol in the house, that then goes on to get drunk a lot quicker than we expected.</p>
      <p>This week’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/spill-it/">Spill It</a> sees a diarist who loves a bargain on his favourite wines, and never wants them to be lonely in the fridge.</p>
      <p>Find out what Chris*, a 49-year-old environmental services officer drinks in a week.</p>
      <h3>Friday</h3>
      <p>It’s almost Friday night and, as a man of a certain age, my excitement for Friday is because I’m NOT going out – woohoo!</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>My evening will consist of a trip to Tesco (though other retailers are available). On my way, I stifle a laugh when I receive a whatsapp from my wife asking me to pick up some loo roll <i><b><u>if</u></b> </i>I am going to Tesco. We’ve been married nearly 20 years… I forget the loo roll!</p>
      <p>Friday night consists of a large glass of Sauvignon from a nearly dead soldier in the fridge followed by a full bottle from my Tesco trip.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Units: 13</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Saturday</h3>
      <p>Spent the day food shopping (yes, Tesco again), being an unlicensed ‘dad cab’ – they really should make becoming one of these more difficult – and ordering a pizza for family movie night.</p>
      <p>The pizza was good, the movie rubbish, but the company was great – my sister-in-law brought over a bottle of Prosecco, which is always welcome. A third of a bottle of bubbles, followed by the second bottle I bought on Friday (I always buy two bottles as they get lonely in the fridge).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Units: 12.8</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Sunday</h3>
      <p>A day spent sorting out old paperwork (not many laughs to be had here except some old payslips from the mid-nineties, which prompted me to ask myself how I afforded to drink back then) and a bottle and a half of Sauvignon shared with my wife over and after dinner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Units: 15</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>A saintly dry night, nothing but fresh orange juice (cue heavenly choirs).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Units: 0</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Tuesday</h3>
      <p>After a very busy day decided to pop into Tesco again for a bottle of Sauvignon to have with sausage, mash and onion gravy – darn it Tesco are doing the two for £9 again…….it’s a deal! Half a bottle and a (large) glass goes down a treat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Units: 8</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Wednesday</h3>
      <p>My son is to be evacuated due to the Blitz (he’s in year 6), which is very stressful so I share the last of Tuesday’s deal with my wife – one large glass.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Units: 3</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Thursday</h3>
      <p>My car has a mind of its own and takes me to, yep you guessed it, Tesco! I resist the 2 for £9 deal (just) and feel good about myself when I get a single one for £6.</p>
      <p>Half a bottle of a lovely Aussie Sauvignon shared, almost a dry night! And, it’s almost Friday again…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Units: 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Total units for the week: 56.8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Total units in a week recommended by the NHS: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/calculating-alcohol-units/">14 units (for anybody regardless of gender)</a>. Obviously, if you’re able to get lower than this, even better!</p>
