      <p>A few months back, Whitney Cummings turned the tables on would-be blackmailers who threatened to leak a photo that she inadvertently shared on social media but then deleted after her followers told her one of her nipples was visible.</p>
      <p>Back in August, the 37-year-old comedian took to Twitter to reveal that people who took screengrabs of her accidental nude pic were “trying to get money from me,” revealing she would instead repost the photo herself in order to thwart the attempted extortion.</p>

      <p>Cummings appeared on Friday’s edition of “The Kelly Clarkson Show”, where she explained what took place in more detail.</p>

      <p>“It wasn’t that bad,” she told Clarkson. “It was actually my own fault. I was doing Instagram Stories one night and weed is now legal in California, which is not a good mix. I had done [a story] and it kind of slipped a little bit.”</p>
      <p>Once she started receiving blackmail threats, Cummings refused to give in.</p>
      <p>“I was like, I’m not giving you my money, I’ve worked too hard,” she continued. “I paid good money [for my boobs]! I’m proud of them.”</p>

      <p>She added: “I was annoyed! There are better nude photos of me. I’m in the bathtub. I look like I’m having a home birth.”</p>
      <p>By reposting the photo herself, Cummings explained, she effectively “took the bargaining chip off the table. It was the only thing I knew how to do. It’s a boob!”</p>
