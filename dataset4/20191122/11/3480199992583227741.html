      <p>Four anti-government protesters have been killed and 65 others injured amid ongoing clashes with Iraqi security forces near a strategic bridge in Baghdad.</p>
      <p>The latest clashes came just hours after some of the most intense street violence seen in recent days, with 10 protesters killed and another 100 injured.</p>
      <p>Security forces used tear gas and live ammunition to repel demonstrators in clashes that lasted well into the night on Thursday.</p>

      <p>On Friday, two protesters were killed by tear gas and another was hit by live rounds fired by security forces on Rasheed Street. A fourth later died from injuries sustained earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>The street is close to Ahrar Bridge, a flashpoint in recent days.</p>
      <p>Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the highest Shia religious authority in Iraq, re-emphasised calls to political parties to pass electoral reform laws and respond to the protesters’ demands.</p>
      <p>Iraq’s massive anti-government protest movement erupted on October 1 and quickly escalated into calls to sweep aside Iraq’s sectarian system.</p>
      <p>Protesters continue to occupy several Baghdad squares and parts of three bridges in a stand-off with security forces.</p>
