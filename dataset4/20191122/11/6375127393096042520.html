      <h3>The coming  45th season of the Philippine Basketball Association will have a new set of officers headed by TNT KaTropa’s Ricky Vargas who has been reelected to a third consecutive term as  chairman of the Board of Governors.</h3>
      <p>Columbian Dyip’s Bobby Rosales and Blackwater Elite’s Silliman Sy, meantime,  were elected as vice chairman and treasurer, respectively, with Atty. Melvin Mendoza, the Board’s long-time secretary and legal counsel retaining his post.</p>
      <p>The PBA board also agreed during its regular meeting on Thursday to extend the deadline for Fil-foreign players who intend to apply for the 2019 Annual Draft to Nov. 29.</p>
      <p>Previously, the deadline for Fil-foreign applicants was Oct. 23. The new date now coincides with the deadline for local applicants.</p>
      <p>PBA commissioner Willie Marcial said the move intends to give a chance to Fil-foreign players who didn’t meet the previous deadline because they are still working on their papers.</p>
      <p>“A number of prospective Fil-foreign applicants have told the Commissioner’s Office that they are still working on important documents required for the Draft and requested if the deadline could be extended,” Marcial said.</p>
      <p>The Annual Draft is set on Dec. 8 at Robinsons Place in Manila.</p>
      <p>In the same gathering, the board also tasked the Commissioner’s Office to launch the Tatluhan sa PBA Tournament in cooperation with the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) starting next season.</p>
      <p>Marcial also said that the league’s 12-member ballclubs will select the players of their respective Tatluhan sa PBA teams. The tournament will be open to all applicants with no age limit including all undrafted applicants for the 2019 Annual Draft and the 2020 PBA D-League Draft.</p>
      <p>A separate Draft will be held specifically for the Tatluhan sa PBA tournament. Once selected, players will have a chance to be a part of a PBA team either as a practice player or as part of its active PBA roster.</p>
