      <p>Whenever a celebrity posts any old picture, our guessing game automatically starts especially when they post a group photo on their social media handles. Something like has happened today on Flashback Friday day when an American supermodel and actress Cindy Crawford shared an old photo on her handle, leaving us to wonder who is who. The photo is loaded with girl power as it comprises of some powerful names including Friends star Jennifer Aniston. Though we have spotted her in one glance, we want to know have you able to spot Rachel Green?</p>
      <p>Well, in case you guys haven’t, let’s break it to you guys. Jennifer is the one who is seen in a black dress, sitting in front while leaning towards Rachel Hunter who is a Yoga instructor. However, the photo also comprises of the Hitch actress Amber Valletta, Star Wars actress Billie Lourd and Days Of Our Lives actress Deidre Hall, to name a few. The photo in question is from 2003 St. Jude Runway. This group photo seems like the girl gang having a big party before posing for a click. Check out the picture below:</p>
