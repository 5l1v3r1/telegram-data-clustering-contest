      <p>KOLKATA: She is undoubtedly the biggest name when it comes to India's representation in the women's tennis circuit, but on Friday it was all about cricket for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sania-Mirza">Sania Mirza</a>. In the city to witness India's maiden <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Day-Night-Test">Day-Night Test</a> at the historic <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>, Sania said that there was no saying 'no' to friend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to IANS, Sania said that it was amazing to be a part of something as historic as the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pink-ball-Test">pink ball Test</a> and said that it does make sense as a fan.</p>
      <p>"Sourav invited us personally as there is also a felicitation. It is great to be a part of something historic. I know Sourav for quite a long time and there was no question of saying no.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, as a fan, it does make a little bit of sense. Technically I cannot say. But as a fan, I can see how this can work in the evening with people coming from work and watching. And everything at night is better usually. It is more dramatic. I don't know if this will be the future or not, but it is great to have something like this and it is a great option," she said.</p>
      <p>Sania is an avid cricket fan and with husband Shoaib Malik playing for Pakistan, does she call for a return of arch-rivals India and Pakistan on the cricket pitch? She refused to get into the debate and said there were people who had the responsibility of taking that call.</p>
      <p>"I don't know. That is not a call for us to take right? People are there who take this call. I do follow cricket regardless of who is playing and I do follow the Indian team and when my husband is playing," she said.</p>
      <p>Asked who her favourite is among the Indian players, the 33-year-old tennis star had a fun take saying that she suddenly feels old now that her friends have all retired. But made no bones about the fact that skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> is her favourite in this team.</p>
      <p>"Virat Kohli I would say. He is the whole country's favourite isn't he? I somehow feel older because all my friends have retired whether it was Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh), Zak (Zaheer Khan) and all. So I will go with Virat," she laughed.</p>
      <p>While cricket is the reason she was at the Eden, any chat with her is incomplete with a point on her return to the tennis court and Sania said that plans are on course and it should be the Australian Open in January.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully in January as I am planning to make a comeback in Hobart in the Australian Open," she signed off.</p>
