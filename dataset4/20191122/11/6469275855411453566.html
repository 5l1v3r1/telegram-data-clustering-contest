        <b>A twin boy born to face a lifetime of severe disability at the Royal Preston Hospital is to be awarded a seven-figure NHS compensation payout.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the boy’s brother was born perfectly healthy, his life will always be blighted by learning difficulties, right-sided paralysis and acute epilepsy.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the now 10-year-old said his mother had suffered miscarriages in the past and her pregnancy was recognised as “high risk”.</p>
      <p>The plan put in place by the consultant in charge of her case was that she should undergo a planned Caesarean before reaching her due date.</p>
      <p>But her barrister, William Featherby QC, claimed that, when she went into labour, repeated attempts were made to achieve a conventional delivery.</p>
      <p>Forceps were used after the baby’s head became “impacted” in his mother’s pelvis and his eventual Caesarean delivery was delayed.</p>
      <p>The barrister claimed the mother never consented to the change of plan and that, had it been followed, her son would have escaped injury.</p>
      <p>Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, however, denied that its medics were in any way to blame.</p>
      <p>It insisted that the consultant’s plan was not written in stone and that the mother had expressed a preference for a conventional delivery.</p>
      <p>Describing it as a “difficult and complex” case, Mr Featherby said there had even been a dispute over whether the boy was delivered before, or after, his twin.</p>
      <p>But he told Judge Sarah Richardson after negotiations, the trust had agreed to pay half the full value of the boy’s damages claim.</p>
      <p>The amount of his payout has yet to be finally assessed, but his award is likely to run into millions even after a 50 per cent reduction.</p>
      <p>Approving the compromise, Judge Richardson said there were significant factual and medical disputes about what happened in the delivery room.</p>
      <p>It was an ‘all or nothing’ case and, had it gone to trial, there was a real risk that the boy and his family might have come away empty-handed.</p>
      <p>NHS counsel, Bradley Martin QC, paid tribute to the boy’s parents for their constructive approach to settling the case.</p>
      <p>They had shown immense commitment to their son’s care and were determined to do their very best for him, he added.</p>
      <p>Judge Richardson concluded: “This settlement properly reflects the risks on both sides.</p>
      <p>“The love and devotion these parents have for their son is quite clear to me.”</p>
      <p>In a statement after the case, Karen Partington, chief executive of Lancashire Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: “We are very sorry for any distress this has caused to the family; we have been working with them to reach a resolution.”</p>
