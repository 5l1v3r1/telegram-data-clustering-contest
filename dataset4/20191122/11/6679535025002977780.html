      <p>Patidar community leader Hardik Patel on Friday extended support to the protest by the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) against the hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>In a message posted on his Twitter handle, he said the students are not fighting a battle for themselves but for the coming generations.</p>
      <p>He said there is a “conspiracy to end JNU” and alleged that the youth are being misguided in the name of religion and nationalism by the government.</p>
      <p>“The country’s youth are engrossed in fake nationalism and religion instead of gaining education and are indifferent towards the movement in JNU. In fact, everyone should participate in this movement,” he said in the message in Hindi.</p>
      <p>He said if people do not want to get educated, or want their children to study, they should tell the JNU students that they “do not want education, but slavery” and the students should discontinue the struggle.</p>
      <p>The JNU students have been protesting against the hostel fee hike and have been on a strike by boycotting classes.</p>
      <p>The HRD ministry has constituted a three-member committee to restore normal functioning of the varsity.</p>
