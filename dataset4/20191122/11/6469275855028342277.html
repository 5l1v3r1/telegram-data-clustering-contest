        <b>Preston North End boss Alex Neil says the loss of talented loan players is a big factor in tomorrow’s opponents Derby having made a slow start to the season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rams are in 16th place ahead of hosting Neil’s men at Pride Park and are somewhat in transition.</p>

      <p>Frank Lampard left for Chelsea in the summer, with former Holland international Phillip Cocu now at the helm.</p>
      <p>Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Harry Wilson were all on loan at Derby last season and helped them reach the play-off final.</p>
      <p>Mount and Tomori are now regulars under Lampard at Chelsea, with Wilson having been loaned to Bournemouth by Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Neil said: “Derby have lost a lot of loan players and if you lose the quality of Harry Wilson, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori it is always going to be a problem.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure in the long term how good it is for a club to have players on loan.</p>
      <p>“You have a group of players who get you to a good level but after the end of a season they aren’t going to be there.</p>
      <p>“Then you need to rebuild and restructure.</p>
      <p>“It has been hard for Phillip Cocu going in there, it is difficult to replicate when players have gone.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty sure that if he had the same players Frank did last year, Derby would be doing well in the league and be quite high up.”</p>
      <p>Despite the Rams being further down the table than envisaged, Neil predicts it will be a tough game tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Four of their five league wins this season have come at home.</p>
      <p>Neil is also an admirer of how well Derby retain the ball, something the statistics back up.</p>
      <p>“They have still got a lot of good players,” said Neil.</p>
      <p>“I have watched a lot of their games because other teams I have been studying have played against Derby.</p>
      <p>“They are good on the ball – after Fulham they are the best team with the ball in terms of you trying to get it back off them. They are the second best at retaining it.</p>
      <p>“We know what their strengths are and we’ve been looking at those.</p>
      <p>“Their manager coming over from another country is having to adapt to what English football is like and that can take time.”</p>
      <p>Derby’s last outing before the international break saw them beaten 1-0 at local rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>However, they won their last home game 2-0 against Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>Tom Lawrence scored both goals that day and is the Rams’ leading scorer with five goals in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Martyn Waghorn is next in the scoring chart with four goals, while Chris Martin has three. Derby’s left-back Max Lowe was on North End’s radar in the summer.</p>
      <p>They put in a bid for the 22-year-old who spent last season in Scotland on loan at Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>Brentford were interested too but Lowe stayed put and has established himself in the Rams side, making 11 starts and one appearance from the bench.</p>
