      <h1>AT&amp;T launches its 5G network next month with the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:43:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/arol-wright/" target="_blank">Arol Wright</a></address>
      <p>The race for rolling out 5G is now in full steam, but AT&amp;T got in a bit of a controversy for, well, trying to cheat. The carrier launched <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sprint-suing-att-5g-e-branding/">what they called their “5GE” network,</a> which is essentially just rebranded 4G LTE and not 5G at all. This, evidently, misled a number of users into thinking they actually had 5G on their phones when they actually didn’t. Nonetheless, AT&amp;T is planning to roll out a real 5G network and this roll-out is set to happen as soon as next month.</p>
      <p>The flagship phone that is set to carry AT&amp;T’s 5G torch? The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review/">Galaxy Note 10+</a> 5G. The carrier will begin selling the 5G-enabled device for a $1,300 price tag next month. The device will work with the company’s 5G network, which will initially be offered in 5 US cities: Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Providence, Rochester, and San Diego. The service will then be rolled out to 10 other cities “soon after” according to AT&amp;T, while nation-wide coverage is set to come during the first half of 2020.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We should keep in mind, though, that this rollout will not include mmWave 5G connections, but rather “low-band” LTE, with speeds expected to be comparable to LTE Advanced. mmWave 5G, which AT&amp;T brands as “5G+”, is already available in parts of 21 US cities, with planned expansions for 2020.</p>
      <p>Unlike the differences found between the Galaxy S10 5G and the Galaxy S10+, which included a quad rear camera and a 3D face recognition system, the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G is mostly identical to the regular Galaxy Note 10+ with the only differences being that the former supports 5G while the latter doesn’t. So if you like the Galaxy Note 10+, your experience will be completely identical for the 5G-enabled model.</p>
      <p>Are you looking forward to 5G service on AT&amp;T?</p>
