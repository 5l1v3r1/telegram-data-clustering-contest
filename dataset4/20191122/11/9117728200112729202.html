      <h1>Rumour: Kubica to sign as Racing Point reserve driver!</h1>

        <b>After announcing he'll leave Williams at the end of the 2019 season, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> will reportedly sign for Racing Point as the team's reserve driver while also competing in DTM in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pole made a to F1 after an eight-year absence following his rallying incident in 2011, which left him maimed. It's not been the comeback of dreams for the one-time Grand Prix winner, however, often struggling to keep up with teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a> as the duo were far off the pace of the rest of the grid.</p>
      <p>Kubica has failed to beat his rookie teammate in qualifying in 20 attempts, but he did score the Williams' only point of the season in Germany, when he classified 10th after both Alfa Romeos got disqualified.</p>

      <p>After announcing his departure from Williams, several teams were keen in Kubica's services as a reserve driver, with teams like Haas and Alfa Romeo interested to contract the veteran.</p>
      <p>Now, according to a report from <a href="https://www.gptoday.net/nl/nieuws/f1/252497/robert-kubica-tekent-als-test-en-reservecoureur-bij-racing-point"><i>GPtoday.net</i></a>, the 34-year-old will sign on as the reserve driver at Racing Point. Kubica already had this role at Williams in 2018 before becoming manning one of the seats this year.</p>
      <p>The same source reports Kubica will sign his contract in a matter of days, with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lance-stroll">Lance Stroll</a> already under contract for 2020 as the team's line-up. The announcement of Kubica should be made within the next days.</p>
