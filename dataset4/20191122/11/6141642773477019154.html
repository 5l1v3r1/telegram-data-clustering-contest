      <h1>Rallying call to buy local in crucial festive period</h1>
      <h2>ISLANDERS are being urged to shop local and support Jersey businesses during what is being billed as a make-or-break Christmas for retailers nationally.</h2>

      <p>In a year which has seen the loss of several major high street names in towns and cities across the British Isles and others going into administration, Chamber of Commerce chief executive Murray Norton urged shoppers to adopt the ‘use it or lose it’ principle.</p>
      <p>He spoke to the JEP ahead of Thursday's Christmas lights switch-on, which heralded the start of La Fête dé Noué and late-night and Sunday shopping.</p>
      <p>Mr Norton said that St Helier retailers were doing relatively well compared with UK counterparts – partly because they did not face the competition of large out-of-town shopping malls which were having an effect on city centre footfall.</p>
      <p>And he urged local shoppers to consider the wider benefits of supporting local retailers before they made their seasonal purchases.</p>
      <p>‘We acknowledge that there will be a lot of online shopping, that’s inevitable.</p>
      <p>‘But local shops need support and people should think twice before they click,’ he said, adding that people should also consider the indirect benefits of shopping locally, including the GST which helps pay for public services and wage-generation which sustains the economy.</p>
      <p>Mr Norton said that he had already seen encouraging signs as Christmas approaches.</p>
      <p>‘On the street there is already a feeling of seeing a really good retail offer. From gift to food shops, there has to be a good shopping experience – shopping is ultimately also a leisure experience and online can’t give you that,’ he said.</p>
      <p>The number of jobs in retail across the British Isles has fallen by more than 100,000 over the past three years, according to the British Retail Consortium.</p>
      <p>This year has seen several major brands collapse or undergo major restructuring.</p>
      <p>Mothercare is due to close, and chains including Karen Millen, Jack Wills, Bathstore, Patisserie Valerie and Debenhams all went into administration earlier this year. Shoe shop Clarks reported a £75 million loss and M&amp;S saw its profits slide. Locally, Beghin’s closed after more than 100 years of trading. Several retail commentators have warned that some UK chains will need strong trading results during the festive period to enable them to survive.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Jersey Consumer Council has reported an increasing number of complaints about the delivery of online purchases to the Island.</p>
      <p>Carl Walker, the council’s chairman, said: ‘There has been a sharp rise in these complaints since the summer and it’s significant that they are consistently in the top ten of those made to the Consumer Council,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Issues ranged from parcels not being delivered a week or more after the date stated by the retailer to items being left at addresses exposed to the elements or in communal areas, or simply being damaged on delivery.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker told the JEP that such matters, allied to difficulties consumers were experiencing as they tried to return damaged goods, were occupying an increasing amount of the council’s time in discussion with online retailers.</p>
      <p>‘I think that consumers still have the appetite to get out onto the high street to get bargains and retailers appear to be doing what they can to attract them into their stores. Time will tell whether they start spending their pounds but local retail is punching well above its weight and no matter how much of a bargain may be available online, I don’t think people want to see St Helier filled only with coffee and charity shops,’ Mr Walker said.</p>
      <p>During last night’s event, which featured a parade through town, the lights were turned on by Pride of Jersey Child of the Year winner Jake Hutchings.</p>
