        <i>Company’s sponsorship of Federalist Society gala prompts action from singer who says site ‘confuses readers regarding truthfulness’</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung">Neil Young</a> has deleted his Facebook artist page in response to the company’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/14/facebook-federalist-society-brett-kavanaugh-gala">sponsorship of the annual gala dinner</a> of the Federalist Society, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jul/06/leonard-leo-supreme-court-replacement-trump-justice-nomination-abortion">powerful rightwing legal group</a> behind the nomination of the conservative supreme court justice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh">Brett Kavanaugh</a>.</p>
      <p>Young also cited the “false information regularly supplied to the public on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a>, with its knowledge” as his reason for removing the account.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel that a social site should be making obvious commitments to one side of politics or the other,” <a href="https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=Facebook-Is-Toast-At-NYA">wrote Young</a> on his website. “It further confuses readers regarding truthfulness in coverage and message.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a>, the world’s largest social media company, was listed as a “gold circle” sponsor of the 2019 National Lawyers Convention in Washington, and was featured in the guidebook app for the event on 14 November, where Kavanaugh was the keynote speaker.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh used his speech to express his “gratitude” to those who stood by him during his supreme court confirmation hearing a year ago following allegations by Dr Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her in their school days. Kavanaugh denied her claims and was approved to the supreme court.</p>
      <p>Days after Kavanaugh’s speech, Blasey Ford <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/18/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh">made a rare public appearance</a> to accept an award from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California in Beverly Hills. “When I came forward last September,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kavanaugh-accuser-christine-blasey-ford-makes-rare-appearance-accept-award-n1084696">she said</a>, “I did not feel courageous. I was simply doing my duty as a citizen.”</p>
      <p>The Federalist Society has played a key role in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/magazine/trump-remaking-courts-judiciary.html">decades-long Republican strategy</a> to pack US courts with conservatives, which has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/">advanced under Donald Trump’s administration</a>. The group’s executive vice-president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jul/06/leonard-leo-supreme-court-replacement-trump-justice-nomination-abortion">Leonard Leo</a>, advised the president on Kavanaugh’s controversial appointment.</p>
