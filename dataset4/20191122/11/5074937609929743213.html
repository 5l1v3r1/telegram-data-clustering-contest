      <h1>Residents welcome the construction of new WR hospital with mixed feelings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:30:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mildred Siabi-Mensah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Takoradi, Nov. 21, GNA - The announcement of the construction of a new regional hospital for the Western Region by Mr. Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghana's Finance Minister has been received with mixed feelings and thoughts by a cross-section of residents within the Region.</p>
      <p>Whiles some residents described the announcement as "old news" which had been rehearsed and doubted it realism in the coming year, others believed that it was always better late than never for the  government to put up such a key social intervention facility to meet the current health needs of the Region.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Effia-Nkwanta Hospital constructed in the 1930s cannot perform to its maximum capacity as it lacked lots of modern health care supplies and infrastructure befitting a Regional or teaching hospital.</p>
      <p>Often times, the Cape Coast Regional Hospital and  the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, have come in handy to save critical conditions, which the current Effia-Nkwanta Regional Hospital  is  unable to handle with the latest being the two St. Mary's Students who were referred to Cape Coast  for further care.</p>
      <p>Ms Augustina Duban, a secretary, told the GNA that the decision by the government to therefore pay attention to the healthcare needs of the Region by building a new Regional Hospital was commendable.</p>
      <p>She said, "government must as a matter of urgency fulfill this part of the budget to help the Regional hospital from transporting people from Effia-Nkwanta to other facilities which  came with associated complications and hazards".</p>
      <p>Over the years, attempts have been made to relocate and build a new Hospital with the first proposal coming from the Past government, though land was acquired at Kansaworodo for the project nothing was heard about it.</p>
      <p>The cross-section of interviewees did not express any different opinion apart from the ones stated above.</p>
      <p>The Finance Minister also announced the construction of five polyclinics in the two Regions at Akontombra, Bogoso, Wassa Dunkwa, Mpohor, Elubo and Nsuaem.</p>
      <p>He said the long-standing issues with the Shama Hospital project has been resolved with a new plan to give the District a new health facility.</p>
