      <p>Hong Kong’s government has torn down the city’s largest pro-democracy “Lennon Wall” outside the Tai Po Market MTR station.</p>
      <p>Message boards made up of Post-It notes and other messages have appeared across Hong Kong since large scale protests began more than five months ago. The biggest one in Tai Po stretched across a vast underground tunnel network.</p>

      <p>Government cleaners were on Friday sent to peel the messages from the tunnel walls. The workers were accompanied by several police officers.</p>
      <p>By 12pm, most posters had been removed.</p>

      <p>A resident <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1493849-20191122.htm?spTabChangeable=0">told</a> RTHK that he had learned a lot about the protest movement from the message boards.</p>
      <p>“I am quite disappointed that they are being removed. We have lost a place where we can reflect and remember what has happened in the past [few months],” he said.</p>
      <p>Another resident said some of the slogans were inappropriate because they contained expletives. “It’s not so good to have curse words in front of people’s families,” she said.</p>

      <p>A third resident said it would be better to have a place for people to express their opinion.</p>
      <p>“The cleaning action made it even uglier,” she said. “Political issues should be resolved politically. The government should reflect on what it has done, including police brutality. [Chief Executive] Carrie Lam should also think about the evil deeds she has done.”</p>

      <p>Hong Kong has seen over 25 weeks of unrest sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition agreement proposal with mainland China. The movement has evolved into wider calls for democratic reform and police accountability, as well as other demands.</p>
