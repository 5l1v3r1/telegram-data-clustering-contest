      <p>After months of teasing on Instagram, a mouth-watering gourmet burger joint will open its doors on Monday, November 25 promising to "blow away your taste buds."</p>
      <p>Buns has had its 1,000+ followers salivating at the thought of juicy burgers since first announcing its arrival in August, saying "something tasty is coming to Nottingham."</p>
      <p>Three months on and the independent business, in the heart of student land, will unleash its menu of tasty burgers, chicken wings and milkshakes on locals.</p>
      <p>Founder Wasim Ali believes it will fulfill a gap in the market for a "proper" takeaway burger joint.</p>

      <p>"We believe the Nottingham takeaway food scene was missing out on fresh handmade smashed beef burgers, proper buttermilk chicken wings/strips, loaded fries and milkshakes.</p>
      <p>"We have recruited chefs from London to fulfil our dreams to create something amazing for the people of Nottingham.</p>
      <p>"It's quality, fresh and the best cuts of meat. The decor is modern and vibrant."</p>
      <p>The new Lenton business, with distinctive pink and black branding, graffiti art and hashtags galore (#bitemebaby #shakeyourbuns) has taken over a former chip shop, which has been empty for some time on the corner of Ilkeston Road and Derby Grove.</p>

      <p>Burger lovers can choose from beef, chicken or veggie in brioche buns.</p>
      <p>There's the classic beef with melted American cheese and "secret" sauce, a smoky variation with turkey rashers, a crispy one with onion rings, a hot spicy one and Philly Cheese Steak with strips of Angus steak, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and cheese.</p>

      <p>And if you want your<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/shopping/geek-retreat-open-nottingham-special-3556382"> burger</a> to match Buns' colour scheme, pink and black buns are available for an extra couple of quid.</p>
      <p>Chicken burgers also come with smoky and spicy flavours, or teriyaki and peri peri. Veggie eaters can tuck into Beyond Meat patties, all plant-based.</p>
      <p>Really hungry customers can go super-size with Yo! Big Beef - a whopping three patties made from Angus beef.</p>
      <p>You can't have burgers without chips and Buns have them in abundance, from rustic and crinkle-cut to masala and sweet potato fries.</p>

      <p>Chicken wings, tender strips and bites are on sale too with five sauces to spice them up or 'naked' Louisiana style.</p>
      <p>To wash it all down there are milkshakes in vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, full-on chocoholic heaven with big name brands such as Oreo and Reese's Peanut Butter shakes or American Fanta in flavours including strawberry and grape.</p>
      <p>With thousands of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/start-date-eight-days-staff-3566180">students</a> living nearby, including those at Radford Mill directly opposite, there was no shortage of job applicants to fill the posts at the takeaway.</p>
      <p>There's seating for eight inside and after Christmas home delivery will become available across Nottingham.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Buns will be open from 11am to midnight seven days a week.</i>
