      <p><i>Uncharted</i> writer and co-creator Amy Hennig is collaborating with Skydance Media (the production team behind movies such as <i>Annihilation</i>, as well as the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> and <i>Terminator</i> franchises) to found a new video game development studio.<br/><br/>Hennig will work alongside her former Electronic Arts comrade-in-arms Julian Beak, with the as-yet-unnamed studio developing "story-focused experiences... designed to reach gamers and non-games alike." Skydance notes that the team's upcoming projects will be cultivated for "emerging streaming platforms."<br/><br/>"The interactive media landscape is continually changing and Amy and Julian are creative and visionary leaders of this evolution," said Skydance Media CEO David Ellison <a href="https://skydance.com/press-release/skydance-media-hires-amy-hennig-and-julian-beak/">in an official statement.</a> "Together, we will create within this new sphere the same type of event-level entertainment experiences that Skydance is known for in features and television."<br/><br/>Aside from being a key figure in the <i>Uncharted</i> series, Hennig has previously been involved with the <i>Jak &amp; Daxter</i> and <i>Soul Reaver</i> series. Beak is known for his work on <i>Battlefield: Hardline, Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel,</i> and the 2015 <i>Need for Speed</i> reboot.<br/><br/>"Julian and I are thrilled to be part of the Skydance creative team, and excited to partner with Skydance to explore this new frontier in entertainment while pioneering new ways to tell immersive stories through technology," said Hennig. "Our goal is to create inviting and innovative experiences with the high production values and visual fidelity that will set the standard in this new media landscape."<br/><br/><a href="https://skydance.com/press-release/skydance-media-hires-amy-hennig-and-julian-beak/">Skydance Media partners with Amy Hennig</a> [Official / <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/18/skydance-media-taps-amy-hennig-to-launch-new-game-studio-for-story-based-games/">Venture Beat</a>]</p>
