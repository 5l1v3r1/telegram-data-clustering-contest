      <p>THE DEATH OF Jeffrey Epstein was the result of a “perfect storm of screw-ups”, US Attorney General William Barr has said.</p>
      <p>His comments came days after two prison officers responsible for guarding Epstein were charged with falsifying records.</p>
      <p>Tova Noel and Michael Thomas are accused of sleeping and browsing the internet instead of checking on Epstein.</p>
      <p>The billionaire was found dead on 10 August in a federal jail in Manhattan as he awaited trial charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.</p>
      <p>A coroner ruled <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/jeffrey-epstein-coroner-4770267-Aug2019/">that he died by suicide</a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said his concerns were prompted by the numerous irregularities at the Manhattan jail where Epstein was being held.</p>
      <p>However, he said after the FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general continued to investigate, he realised there were a “series” of mistakes made that gave Epstein the chance to take his own life.</p>
      <p>“I can understand people who immediately, whose minds went to sort of the worst-case scenario because it was a perfect storm of screw-ups,” Barr said.</p>
      <p>Barr said federal prosecutors in New York are making good progress while they continue to investigate allegations against Epstein, and he is hopeful people “will see results soon”.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for Thomas claimed both guards are being “scapegoated”.</p>
      <p>Noel’s lawyer said he hopes to “reach a reasonable agreement” with the government to avoid a trial.</p>
