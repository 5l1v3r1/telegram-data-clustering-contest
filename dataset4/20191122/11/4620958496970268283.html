      <p>More than 30 Vancouver Police Department officers were feted in Victoria Thursday for their actions on the job.</p>
      <p>The Police Honours Night recognized law enforcement members across the spectrum, highlighting meritorious service, bravery in life-saving incidents and valour.</p>
      <p>Representatives from the B.C. Association of Chiefs of Police, the B.C. Association of Municipal Chiefs of Police, the RCMP and the ministry’s Policing and Security Branch comprise a committee that selected the recipients.</p>
      <p>“It takes a special kind of person to serve in law enforcement, those who know the dangers and challenges of their profession but remain committed to serve with pride and never shy away from their duty,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, in a news release. “[Thursday’s] honourees are examples of that commitment in action and on behalf of all British Columbians, we thank officers just like them all across the province for their immeasurable contributions to public safety.”</p>
