      <p>KOLKATA: Bangladesh's Mehidy Hasan came in as concussion substitute after wicketkeeper-batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Liton-Das">Liton Das</a> was hit by a snorter from India pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammed Shami</a> on the opening day of the Day/Night Test.</p>
      <p>However, Mehidy, an off-spinner, will not be allowed to bowl as per the concussion substitute rule. Mehidy, though, did not last long as he was dismissed by pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a> for just eight runs.</p>
      <p>Das was retired hurt after being hit on his head at the stroke of lunch at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trying to play a pull short off a Shami bouncer, the heavily-lacquered pink ball blazed in and hit his helmet in the forehead region in the third ball of the 20th over. He was batting on 16 then.</p>
      <p>The physio rushed in, conducted a test and he continued batting, responding with a boundary in the next delivery.</p>
      <p>Das hit another boundary in the next over off Ishant and added nine runs before complaining of discomfort. He was next seen walking off the field after a long conversation with the umpire, forcing the end of the first session with the score reading 73 for six.</p>
      <p>Das' like-for-like substitute <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saif-Hassan">Saif Hassan</a> is down with a (split webbing) injury, forcing the visitors to opt for Mehidy as concussion substitute.</p>
      <p>According to the protocol, a proper medical report has to be submitted to the match referee for a concussion substitute.</p>
