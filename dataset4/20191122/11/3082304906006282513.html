        <b>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not believe it affects himself or Manchester United.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not concerned by Mauricio Pochettino’s new-found employment status – and conceded any manager would want his Manchester United job.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been a rumoured target for United for some time and is now available after being sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>With the Red Devils sitting seventh in the Premier League table, nine points adrift of a Champions League spot, Solskjaer could be forgiven for looking nervously over his shoulder, but the Norwegian cut a relaxed figure at his media conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Sunday’s trip to Sheffield United, he said: “It’s always sad when one of your colleagues – a good man – loses his job just before Christmas. It’s never nice to see. I just wish him all the best.</p>
      <p>“In football you can never be surprised or you can’t be shocked at anything. For me, I’ve just got to focus on us.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t bother me at all. I’ve got the best job in the world. I’m sure that if you’re in a job or if you’re out of a job and you’re a manager, you want this job.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer says he has open communication with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and is confident he will be granted the time and resources to improve United’s fortunes.</p>
      <p>He added: “It doesn’t really matter [that Pochettino is out of work]. I’ve got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can.</p>
      <p>“I speak with Ed, I speak with the owners all the time about how we’re going to move the club forward. That doesn’t change if some other clubs change their managers.”</p>

      <p>Pochettino was replaced by former United boss Jose Mourinho, and Solskjaer was pleased to have such an engaging, and controversial, figure back in English football.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to have Jose back, definitely – especially for you guys [the media],” he said.</p>
      <p>“Maybe for me because you can talk and write about everything else.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s arrival in north London prompted suggestions on social media that the Portuguese will immediately target United midfielder Nemanja Matic in January – a player he has worked with previously at Old Trafford and Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Matic even liked one post and replied with laughing and clapping emojis, but Solskjaer, who has previously encouraged his players to be “boring” on Twitter and Instagram, appeared unconcerned.</p>
      <p>He said: “No, that’s not a part of being boring.</p>
      <p>“You like Jose coming back. It’s going to be a spectacle and a circus. Nemanja has got a sense of humour.”</p>
