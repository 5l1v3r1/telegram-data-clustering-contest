      <p>The box, located in a garden on Westray Street in the city’s Milton area, has been lined with tinned food for “anyone facing an emergency”.</p>

      <p>Residents are encouraged to leave bites to eat if they can to ensure the charity box remains topped up.</p>
      <p>Advertising the food box, a local Facebook group said: “"Give or Take" foodbox in a local garden.</p>
      <p>“It might get vandalised, it might not work but we thought we would give it a try especially at this time of the year.</p>
      <p>“It’s topped up with tinned food for anyone facing an emergency that needs it.</p>
      <p>“People can take food or leave food if it’s running low.”</p>
      <p>They added: "We can't fear failure, we want to test it and we will accept whatever happens. Too many people are going hungry."</p>
      <p>Social media users hailed the idea.</p>
      <p>One Facebook user wrote: “Brilliant Idea.”</p>
      <p>Another commented: “This is such a thoughtful thing to do.</p>
      <p>“I really hope people don't take the Mick and use it properly, could be a great thing!”</p>
      <p>A third person said: “Brilliant idea, I hope the needy use it &amp; not the greedy.</p>
      <p>“Well done for giving this a go. Fingers crossed that it's not vandalised &amp; people use it”.</p>
      <p>And a fourth Facebook user wrote: “Beautiful idea! Hope it spreads to other areas”.</p>
