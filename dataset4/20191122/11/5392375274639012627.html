      <p>Honor Watch Magic 2 Appears in Official Teaser, It’ll be Waterproof<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Along with the Honor V30 which –  as we learned in <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/22/honor-v30-unveiled-in-first-official-video/">this article</a> – will launch on November 26th, another quite interesting device is getting unveiled in the same day. We’re talking about the upcoming Honor Watch Magic 2.</p>

      <p>Honor’s second generation smart watch is indeed the star of a very engaging teaser. The video starts with a quote from Winston Churchill’s speech “We shall fight on the beaches..”  in 1941; followed up by the famous “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” quote by Neil Armstrong; to end with the first ever call over a wireless cell phone by Marty Cooper in 1973.</p>
      <p>These epoch-making quotes are then followed by the first look at the Honor Watch Magic 2. The smartwatch, which is wore by a guy taking a shower, appears to feature a rounded design very similar to the original Honor Watch Magic. In fact, the design is quite identical with the only two physical buttons on the right side.</p>

      <p>Additionally, by watching the video we can also assume the wearable will be quite water proof. Most smartwatches nowadays are 5ATM waterproof or thereabout, so this isn’t a very surprising feature, yet we’re glad the Watch Magic 2 will boast it.</p>
      <p>The smartwatch will most likely be coming with Huawei’s Kirin A1 chipset. Meanwhile other features should include an integrated GPS module, an NFC modul for electronic payments and much more, a heart rate sensor, an AMOLED display and around 7 days of battery life.</p>
