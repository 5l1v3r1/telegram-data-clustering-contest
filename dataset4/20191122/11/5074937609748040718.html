      <h1>Fecal matter, our natural resource for energy - CAFAF</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:00:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Francis Duku-Boateng, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 21, GNA - Mr Joseph Senyo Kwashie, the Executive Director of Community And Family Aid Foundation (CAFAF), a Non Governmental Organization (NGO), has said fecal matter is our natural resource for energy production.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwashie said this in a press release copied to the Ghana News Agency to commemorate the World Toilet Day.</p>
      <p>The day is celebrated every year to inspire action to tackle the global sanitation crisis and help achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, which promises sanitation for all by 2030.</p>
      <p>The theme for this year’s e celebration is: ‘leaving no one behind’.</p>
      <p>He said there is nothing like waste due to advancement in technology and called for fecal matter to be seen as an economic resource.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwashie urged the world leaders and the business community to invest in toilet management to take advantage of the opportunities that could be derived from such ventures.</p>
      <p>He said statistics shows that 4.2 billion people live without safely managed sanitation in the world which is more than half the global population whiles 673 million people still practice open defecation and 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces globally.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwashie said inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 432,000 diarrhea related deaths every year globally and is a major factor in diseases such as intestinal worms and trachoma.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the UNICEF 2019 report reveals that children under the age of five living in countries affected by protracted conflict are on average, more likely to die from diarrhea diseases caused by a lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene than by direct violence.</p>
