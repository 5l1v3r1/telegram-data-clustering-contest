      <p>The announcement means drivers will pay no more than £1.20 per litre of petrol and £1.24 for diesel at Asda's 322 filling stations.</p>
      <p>This is the firm's lowest price for petrol since April.</p>
      <p>Morrisons and Sainsbury's responded by pledging to implement the same price cut over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Asda senior fuel buyer Dave Tyrer said: "With Christmas just around the corner, we're pleased to be able to lower the cost of fuel and pass these savings on to our customers."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week the RAC accused fuel retailers of refusing to pass on a fall in wholesale prices, claiming drivers were being overcharged by more than 5p per litre for petrol and 4p for diesel.</p>
      <p>Government figures published on Tuesday showed the average cost of fuel in the UK was £1.26 for petrol and £1.30 for diesel.</p>
