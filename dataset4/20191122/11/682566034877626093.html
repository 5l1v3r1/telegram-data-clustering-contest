      <p>Cape Town - Serbian striker <b>Samir Nurkovic</b> has praised the <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> supporters and stated that they help motivate him to give his all in every game.</p>
      <p>Nurkovic joined Amakhosi from Slovakian second division side KFC Komarno in the pre-season and has had to adapt quickly to the increased sizes of the stadiums packed with passionate Chiefs fans.</p>
      <p>Yet he appears to have settled in quickly at Chiefs and is relishing the boisterous support the Soweto giants receive every week, whether playing at home or on the road.</p>
      <p>"A wonderful feeling and a wonderful experience for me‚" he said, as quoted by <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/2019-11-22-samir-nurkovic-kaizer-chiefs-have-the-best-fans-in-the-world/">TimesLive</a>.</p>
      <p>"For me‚ right now‚ they are the best fans in the world‚ Amakhosi. They support us whether we play at home or away. When we play away we feel like we play at home."</p>
      <p>He added: "I enjoy every moment‚ on and off he field. We love and appreciate their support.</p>
      <p>"Me especially - because of them I am giving everything‚ and in every game 100 percent."</p>
      <p>Chiefs will take on Maritzburg United in the Telkom Knockout semi-finals on Sunday at Mbombela Stadium.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 15:00.</p>
