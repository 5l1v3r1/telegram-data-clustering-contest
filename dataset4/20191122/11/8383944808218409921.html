      <p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg highlighted Turkey's importance in the alliance in an interview Thursday with French newspaper Le Figaro.</p>
      <p>"All allies have criticized the operation, but no one questioned Turkey's place in NATO," Stoltenberg told the paper, referring to Operation Peace Spring launched by Turkey in October.</p>
      <p>"Turkey joined the struggle against Daesh by allowing its allies to use their bases. Turkey (is) the only country in NATO on the border with Syria and Iraq," he said.</p>
      <p>"Turkey accommodates 3.6 million migrants. Turkey is very important for NATO. To understand this, (we) need to look at the map and examine the geostrategic situation in Turkey," Stoltenberg noted.</p>
      <p>A member of the bloc since 1952, Turkey boasts NATO's second-largest army after the United States.</p>
      <p>When the U.S. and many other NATO allies were spreading anti-Turkey sentiments during the country's operation in Syria, the NATO secretary-general continued to show support, saying that NATO is strongly committed to Turkey's security.</p>
