      <h3>THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) kicked off its Safe Philippines project through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with five local government units (LGUs) in Metro Manila yesterday during a roadshow hosted by the Marikina City Government.</h3>
      <p>The five LGUs that have committed to adopt the Safe Philippines project in their localities are the city governments of Marikina, Parañaque, Pasig, San Juan, and Valenzuela.</p>
      <p>DILG Secretary Eduardo M. Año says that the Safe Philippines project aims to improve the capabilities of the department and LGUs toward a more collaborative and more efficient management of public order, safety and security, using available information and communication technology (ICT)-driven subsystems and solutions. Specifically, the project targets to reduce crime rate and improve response time of law enforcers and responders such as police and fire personnel during natural and human-induced emergencies.</p>
      <p>“Safe Philippines can also help urban, transport, and disaster planners strategize future plans for city development and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) measures,” he says during his speech at the Marikina Hotel and Convention Center.</p>
      <p>“In our aim to solve the traffic woes in key cities, we believe that the Safe Philippines Project will likewise help sustain the gains of our continuous national road clearing program which the DILG pioneers as we heed the call of President Rodrigo Duterte to reclaim public roads being used for private ends,” he says.</p>
      <p>The project entails the construction of an integrated or converged Intelligent Command, Control and Communication Center (IC4) for the National 911 Public Safety Answering Point, DILG, Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology. It also requires the establishment of city-level command centers.</p>
      <p>The first phase of the project works through its four cornerstones using advanced ICT namely intelligent video monitoring, multimedia critical communication, information management (big data analytics), and command center systems.</p>
