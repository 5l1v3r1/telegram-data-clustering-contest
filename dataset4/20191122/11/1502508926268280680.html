      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>has achieved the highest road length in the country this year so far under a Centre's rural roads' programme with the completion of around 11,400 kilometres covering 1,838 habitations, officials said on Friday.</p>
      <p>This includes 1,161 km for the current financial year against the total sanctioned road length of 19,700 km, they said.</p>
      <p>The work is being carried under the centrally-sponsored <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pradhan-mantri-gram-sadak-yojana">Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana </a>(PMGSY), which is a mega flagship programme with the main objective of providing connectivity to rural areas.</p>
      <p>The programme is being implemented by the Public Works (Roads and Buildings) Department of the Union Territory.</p>
      <p>Under the Central Road Fund, 88 schemes have been completed, including 22 bridges and 66 roads, with a target set for completion of 25 such schemes for the current year, an official spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Regarding NABARD funding, a total of 518 works were approved, of which 147 have been completed while 34 works have been targeted for completion during the current year, he said.</p>
      <p>Besides, the government launched an ambitious scheme called 'Languishing Programme' in 2018 to complete those projects that were stopped midway due to paucity of funds, the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The government arranged special funds for the completion of such projects, he added.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said as many as 593 projects with a total sanctioned cost of Rs 1,313 crore were provided under the road and bridge sector as on date.</p>
      <p>Out of the sanctioned projects, 83 projects have been completed and thrown open for public, which include 54 bridges and 27 roads, he said.</p>
      <p>Likewise, 100 more projects are likely to be completed by the end of this financial year, the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Special Bridge Programme funded under the capital expenditure component of the budget, the spokesman said, a total number of 115 bridges have been taken up for execution.</p>
      <p>Out of this, 59 bridges are being targeted for completion during the current year and till date 46 bridges have been completed, he added.</p>
