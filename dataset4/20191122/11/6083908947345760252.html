      <h1>What Chick-fil-A's Dan Cathy Told Franklin Graham About the Company Stopping Donations to Christian Charities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/leahbarkoukis" target="_blank">Leah Barkoukis</a></address>
      <p>After news that Chick-fil-A would <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2019/11/18/heres-why-conservatives-are-suddenly-peeved-at-chick-fil-a-n2556673">cut its donations to three Christian charities</a>, Rev. Franklin Graham decided to pick up the phone and call the company’s CEO, Dan Cathy, to find out exactly what was going on.</p>
      <p>“Has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChickfilA/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAkuIwOyszvnn_XWRV-ED-zrXf2BuUOtL_OLCDVfewIelVD7n4ofyy7CvpdEHgNgUeu-YYLKUP8XaF7&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDF-Lwi4UPh5-u8LTBRKZhohDwgm01nQEt3rYbGOJckj7xpKcDTwdO0WXNQ-BXv8iTYoR2H_y1axdWAQMJqLmBf63mPkLKO_3K3MzQKzVf0l5NnGDvZaiwI6Ml9DMy3glxMJfUQo8VfnrxJzEKkLASgcK7e8TLGYQg_NfrRSLwQ1vGLBbvyK1vRn3KCchXuoo57JMl9v2GbBwhuwgjyx2U6n6UTOWdYoYBF_32LjxLOmkac97Q_r5VTItBo7KGzww9VRiiqevTzGq0BWmjLERl0NmJnMMqDZzgTGRGzXIxKldYmvXj5aNVWIuwNh3hNXIzEiJvVfcZ5VHNQ5HshtQ">Chick-fil-A</a> caved? Some are saying they’ve rolled over, that they’ve conceded to the LGBTQ protests because they released a statement about their charitable giving. They announced that in 2020 they’re giving to fight hunger and homelessness and support education. What’s wrong with that?” Graham wrote in a Facebook post.</p>
      <p>“Dan was very clear that they have not bowed down to anyone’s demands, including the LGBTQ community. They will continue to support whoever they want to support,” he continued. “They haven’t changed who they are or what they believe. Chick-fil-A remains committed to Christian values. Dan Cathy assured me that this isn’t going to change.”</p>
      <p>Graham went on to note that the LGBT community would only truly be happy with Chick-fil-A if they were open on Sundays, flew rainbow flags, and used all their charitable giving to help LGBT groups.</p>
      <p>“Their hatred for Chick-fil-A is rooted in founder Truett Cathy’s strong stand for biblical “traditional” values and his desire to honor God,” he said.</p>
      <p>Graham said he hopes “all those who jumped to the wrong conclusion about” Chick-fil-A read his post.</p>
      <p>While the conversation may have reassured Graham, others were not so easily convinced.</p>
      <p>Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, <a href="https://www.christianpost.com/voice/mat-staver-responds-to-franklin-graham-chick-fil-a-is-now-funding-pro-lgbt-group.html">said </a>Graham did a “huge disservice” by not asking more questions about the company’s “betrayal and capitulation to the LGBT agenda.”</p>
      <p>“While Dan Cathy may say the company has the same values, the company’s statements and actions tell a different story,” Staver said, pointing to the company expanding its partnership with Covenant House, a group he says “celebrates homosexuality, transgenderism, and the entire LGBTQ agenda.”</p>
