      <p>Things got a little out of hand on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> almost ‘killed’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> with his cooking.</p>
      <p>As the outlaws in the jailhouse camp tucked into their evening meal of camel fillet, Andrew ate a large part of camel and started to choke as it got stuck in his throat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> and Andy Whyment came to the rescue as they started to hit the comedian on the back, and eventually they managed to get the meat out</p>
      <p>‘Chew your food, mate you scared us,’ exclaimed Myles as Andrew thanked everyone.</p>
      <p>Kate continued: ‘You went bright red, I was like “oh my god”.’</p>
      <p>Andy then pleaded with Andrew ‘not to do that again’ while Cliff offered to chew his meat for him going forwards.</p>

      <p>The camp burst out laughing as Kate added:  ‘I didn’t mean it like that.’</p>
      <p>‘I can’t believe I nearly killed Andrew Maxwell,’ Myles added.</p>
      <p>Andrew responded: ‘You didn’t, I nearly killed me.’</p>
      <p>The camp thanked Myles for cooking the food as Andrew said: ‘Let that be a lesson to you kids, chew your camel.’</p>
