      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - A Pennsylvania man has been convicted of raping a woman in a New York apartment that he helped her find.</p>
      <p>Court records show Ashok Singh was found guilty Wednesday. The 58-year-old from Easton, Pennsylvania, is set for sentencing Dec. 19.</p>
      <p>A message was left Friday for his attorney.</p>
      <p>Queens Acting District Attorney John Ryan says the 40-year-old woman was looking for apartments-for-rent fliers at a house of worship in December 2015 when she encountered Singh, who offered to help her house-hunt.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say he called her four days later to say he'd found a place. He helped her move and bought food and wine.</p>
      <p>Ryan says Singh became enraged and forcibly raped the woman after she refused to drink alcohol with him. She ran for help after he fell asleep.</p>
