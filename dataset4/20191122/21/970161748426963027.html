      <p>There’s never a dull moment in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle and tonight was no different.</p>
      <p>Picture this – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> pouring cold water on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> while he’s dressed in budgie smugglers – and it’s safe to say Kate could not keep a straight face.</p>
      <p>As the campmates discussed having a shower, Andrew said he was happy to go first as he commented: ‘If you’re gonna wash under a bucket, do it glamour.’</p>
      <p>Andrew changed into his budgie smugglers and as Andy saw them he exclaimed ‘Oh my god, what on earth are they?’</p>

      <p>It could have been a scene from a shampoo advert as Kate threw cold water over the comedian as she laughed: ‘Just when you think the Jungle couldn’t get anymore weird, I feel like I’ve gone over the rainbow and I’m in Wizard of Oz or something, it’s too weird.’</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Kate and Andrew had an awkward moment as the ITV presenter offered to ‘chew’ Andrew’s meat for him.</p>

      <p>As the outlaws in the jailhouse camp tucked into their evening meal of camel fillet, Andrew ate a large part of camel and started to choke as it got stuck in his throat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> and Andy Whyment came to the rescue as they started to hit the comedian on the back, and eventually they managed to get the meat out</p>
      <p>‘Chew your food, mate you scared us,’ exclaimed Myles as Andrew thanked everyone.</p>

      <p>Kate continued: ‘You went bright red, I was like “oh my god”.’</p>
      <p>Andy then pleaded with Andrew ‘not to do that again’ while Cliff offered to chew his meat for him going forwards.</p>
      <p>Kate then joked: ‘I can chew your meat anytime you need.’</p>

      <p>The camp burst out laughing as Kate added:  ‘I didn’t mean it like that.’</p>
