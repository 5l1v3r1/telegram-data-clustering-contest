      <p>Prince Andrew’s daughters have vowed to “keep calm and carry on” amid the scandal engulfing their father.</p>
      <p>After a disastrous week for the Duke of York following his devastating BBC interview, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have remained resolute and vowed to support him after he was sacked by the Queen and Prince Charles.</p>
      <p>But insiders believe Andrew’s banishment from public life could have a direct effect on their royal careers.</p>
      <p>The sisters are not “working royals” and have day jobs alongside their charity patronages and various campaigning roles.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, is vice president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, an American software company where she focuses on “client development”, while Eugenie, 29, has a role at the Hauser &amp; Wirth Art Gallery in Mayfair, west London.</p>

      <p>Andrew has always campaigned for his “blood Princesses” to have a greater role within the royal family, but his dramatic downfall will mean he has little, if any, say in their royal roles in future, sources have suggested.</p>
      <p>The princesses are understood to be entirely focused on supporting their father, alongside their mother Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, as Andrew picks up the pieces of his decision to be interviewed by the BBC over his relationship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>A friend of Beatrice and Eugenie said: “They have both been extremely resolute and told Andrew they will support him in any way they can.</p>

      <p>“They have their passions and causes which they successfully manage, but are two ambitious women who can stand on their own.</p>
      <p>“It’s been very much a case of keep calm and carry on for them both.</p>
      <p>“They are close to cousins William and Harry and are adored by the Queen, who all will continue to advise them on their futures.”</p>

      <p>It is thought Beatrice’s wedding to property millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 36, next year could be scaled down and “less public” than her sister’s.</p>
      <p>When Eugenie wed Jack Brooksbank, 33, last year, in St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, the big day included a carriage ride through Windsor.</p>
