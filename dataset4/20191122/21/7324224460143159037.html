      <p>Jeremy Corbyn insisted he would take a “neutral stance” in an EU referendum under Labour while Boris Johnson was challenged over “racist rhetoric” and trustworthiness during a brutal televised grilling.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister refused to apologise over his use of language and defended Tory austerity during a special episode of BBC’s Question Time on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader also came under fierce scrutiny from voters when he was questioned over fears for businesses, anti-Semitism, misogyny, freedom of speech and Scottish independence.</p>
      <p>As they try to tip the balance in the campaign for the December 12 General Election, the leaders of the four main parties were quizzed for half-an-hour apiece.</p>
      <p>But the highest levels of groaning and jeering were reserved for the frontrunners in the Sheffield studio.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn made his clearest comment to date on how he would act in another referendum, which Labour plans to hold between a new deal and the option to Remain within six months of taking power.</p>
      <p>Having been asked how anyone could vote Labour without knowing what outcome he would campaign for, Mr Corbyn said that he would start by negotiating a “credible” Leave deal before he was interrupted by laughing.</p>
      <p>“And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Host Fiona Bruce pressed Mr Corbyn on whether he would not pick a side during another referendum, as she brought his time to a close.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” he replied. “First heard here on Question Time.”</p>

      <p>The Tory PM was asked to apologise and admit he had personally contributed to “racist rhetoric” during his journalistic work.</p>
      <p>Ms Bruce challenged him for comparing veiled Muslim women to “letterboxes”, referring to “watermelon smiles” and “flag-waving piccaninnies” and to “tank-topped bum boys”.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said he “genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody and that is my intention”.</p>
      <p>But the audience scoffed when he added: “If you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases, there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course I understand that.”</p>
      <p>One junior doctor accused him of “lying to us” as she challenged the Tories’ record on the NHS, while another voter questioned whether he could be trusted.</p>
      <p>In his response, Mr Johnson was met with groans when he said the NHS’s demands could only be met when “we get Brexit done”.</p>
      <p>He was also challenged over levels of child poverty and how many new hospitals the Tories were planning to build after the scheduled number dropped from 40 to six.</p>

      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson denied treating voters as “stupid” over her plans to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit without another referendum.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson added: “I don’t think you can accuse us of not being upfront about wanting to stop Brexit. We’ve been crystal clear about that from the very beginning.”</p>
      <p>SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon cast doubt on Mr Corbyn’s stance of not allowing another independence referendum in the early years of an administration under his leadership.</p>
      <p>She suggested he was not “going to walk away from the chance to end austerity”, and added: “I’m not sure he’s going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue.”</p>
      <p>The audience was made up of around 150 people which, the BBC said, was a roughly equal split between Conservative and Labour supporters with a smaller number for the Liberal Democrats and SNP.</p>
      <p>There was a slim majority for people who voted Leave over Remain, except for some who were too young to vote at the last election, the broadcaster added.</p>
