      <p>Clark, the son of former Toon player and current Blyth Spartans boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lee-clark/"><b>Lee Clark</b></a>, made history earlier this season when he played for the club's under-18 team aged just 14 years and 206 days.</p>
      <p>Current Magpies boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-bruce/"><b>Steve Bruce</b></a> has said that the youngster is the best schoolboy prospect at the club and Clark is due to make his debut for England's under-15 side when they play the Republic of Ireland and Turkey next month.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Tottenham have now entered the race to sign the youngster and they are thought to have stolen a march on the other interested parties.</p>
      <p>Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Bayern Munich have all been linked with Clark, but it is believed that the youngster's parents would prefer him to continue his development with his hometown club.</p>
