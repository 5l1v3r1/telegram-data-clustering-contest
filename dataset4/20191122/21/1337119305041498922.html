      <p>Apple is delaying the theatrical release of its upcoming feature film <i>The Banker </i>following sexual misconduct allegations leveled about Bernard Garrett Jr., the son of the character depicted by Anthony Mackie in the film.</p>
      <p>“We purchased <i>The Banker</i> earlier this year as we were moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy,” an Apple representative said in a statement to <i>The Verge, </i>echoing what the company previously said. “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps. In light of this, we are no longer premiering <i>The Banke</i>r at AFI Fest.”</p>
      <p>The theatrical release is delayed at this time, with no revised release date available, the company confirmed to <i>The Verge</i>. The film was originally due to have its premiere on November 21st, on the closing night of AFI Fest in Hollywood, ahead of its theatrical release on December 6th.</p>

      <p>With a cast that includes Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Hoult, and Nia Long, <i>The Banker</i> is one of the highest profile films acquired by Apple for its streaming service. The movie also marked Apple’s first major foray into theatrical releases, with early reports suggesting it could make Apple an Oscar contender. <i>The Banker </i>was originally due to arrive on the company’s Apple TV Plus streaming service early next year, but Apple hasn’t provided any comment on whether that has changed following the controversy.</p>
      <p>Garrett Jr. has been involved with promoting the film, and acted as a consultant during its production, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/apple-delaying-theatrical-release-of-the-banker-1202793242/"><i>Deadline </i>previously reported</a>. <i>The Banker </i>is one of three films Apple was set to release in 2019 alongside <i>The Elephant Queen</i> and <i>Hala.</i></p>
      <p><i><b>Update (November 22nd, 4:40pm ET): </b></i><i>The story has been updated to note that Apple has completely delayed </i>The Banker’s<i> theatrical release. The updated story also includes additional comment from Apple.</i></p>
