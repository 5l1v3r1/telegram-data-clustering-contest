      <p>Lil Nas X's lawyers are denying the rap star stole the beat for his smash single "Rodeo" featuring Cardi B.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Rapper Lil Nas X is denying an allegation that he stole one of us hit records from an unknown rapper.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/lil-nas-x-and-cardi-b-slapped-with-lawsuit-over-rodeo-75zWxLP0rEW2R9P0HMfFlA/">Producer/rapper Brandon Lee sued Lil Nas and Cardi B. in October, over their hit song “Rodeo."</a>
      </p>
      <p>He claims "Rodeo" sampled a song titled "Broad Day" by a duo named PuertoReefa &amp; Sakrite Duexe.</p>
      <p>Brandon Lee says that "Broad Day" was based on his song "gwenXdonlee4-142," so he sued the pair.</p>
      <p>Lil Nas X has replied to the lawsuit and is gearing up for a legal fight because he maintains Lee's song it's nothing like "Rodeo."</p>
      <p>"The work, 'Rodeo,' was created independently from and without knowledge of the allegedly infringed work," Lil Nas X's lawyers argued.</p>
      <p>"The Complaint, and each purported claim for relief alleged in it, fails because the musical elements from 'gwenXdonlee4-142' supposedly used in 'Rodeo' are neither original to Plaintiffs nor copyrightable subject matter."</p>
      <p>A lot of money is at stake for the lawsuit "Rodeo" was featured on Lil Nas X's debut <i>EP 7</i>, which features the smash single "Old Town Road."</p>
      <p>A judge has yet to rule on the case. </p>
