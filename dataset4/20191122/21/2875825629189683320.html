      <p>I'm A Celebrity 2019 star Andrew Maxwell horrified his campmates as he began choking on his dinner in the latest episode - with Andrew even crediting his co-stars to saving his life.</p>
      <p>As the comedian attempted to digest camel meat, it got lodged in his throat leaving him struggling.</p>
      <p>Andrew began choking, with a "scared" Kate Garraway and Andy Whyment rushing over to help him as he sat on his knees trying to bring the food up.</p>
      <p>As they slapped his back, they helped him release the meat with him able to spit it out.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa quickly got him some water as he laughed off the panicking moment in the jungle jail.</p>

      <p>His co-stars failed to see the funny side, relieved to see him no longer choking but confessing they were worried for him.</p>
      <p>He even ate the same piece of meat after.</p>
      <p>Camp cook Myles Stephenson even feared he'd killed him, but Andrew was quick to take the blame.</p>
      <p>Andrew had attempted to swallow a huge chunk of chewy camel fillet, which had been won by Jacqueline and Myles in the latest Bushtucker Trial.</p>

      <p>Myles told him as he recovered: "Chew your food, mate you scared us."</p>
      <p>As Andrew laughed, Kate said: "You went bright red, I was like ‘oh my god’."</p>
      <p>Andy said after helping the campmate: "Please don’t do that again Andrew.”</p>

      <p>It's then that Rak-Su singer Myles confessed: "I can’t believe I nearly killed Andrew Maxwell," with Andrew replying: "You didn’t, I nearly killed me."</p>
      <p>The stars are currently in the jungle jail, with newcomers Andy and Cliff yet to enter the main camp.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline and Myles were told after their trial that they would be joining the separate camp.</p>
      <p>They then had to decide who the food should go too, before eventually deciding the jail via a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
