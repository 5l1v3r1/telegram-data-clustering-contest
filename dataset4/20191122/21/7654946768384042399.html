      <h1>Didi Gregorius a potential piece in Phillies’ big offseason plans</h1>

      <p>There may be a Yankees reunion coming to Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>MLB.com reported Friday <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/didi-gregorius-rumors">the Phillies are interested in Didi Gregorius</a>, who the Yankees chose not to extend a qualifying offer to in early November. Joe Girardi, who managed Gregorius in his first three seasons in The Bronx, recently became the Phillies manager.</p>
      <p>“I want to say Congratulations to one of my old managers Joe Girardi and to one of my ex teammate/mentor @carlosbeltran15 for getting Managing jobs !!!… Well deserved!!” <a href="https://twitter.com/DidiG18/status/1191512911182741505?s=20">Gregorius tweeted earlier this month.</a></p>
      <p>A talent evaluator <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/the-didi-gregorius-free-agency-scenario-that-cant-be-ruled-out/">recently suggested to The Post</a> that Gregorius, 29, could get a three-year deal this offseason, despite a lackluster 2019 campaign after he came back from offseason Tommy John surgery.</p>
      <p>This is expected to be another big offseason for Philadelphia after they added Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto, Jean Segura, Andrew McCutchen and David Robertson before the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>The Phillies would likely look to move Segura to third base and have Gregorius step in as the new starting shortstop. Segura could also be used at second, opening the option to put Scott Kingery at third.</p>
      <p>The report also states that the Phillies have interest in Giants ace Madison Bumgarner.</p>
