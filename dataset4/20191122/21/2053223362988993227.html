In addition to the Total Consideration, accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Settlement Date (as defined below) will be payable in cash on all validly tendered and accepted Notes. Interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, including any such Notes tendered through guaranteed delivery procedures. As a result, Notes tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedures will not receive accrued interest from the Settlement Date through the Guaranteed Delivery Settlement Date, which is expected to be November 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>Payment for Notes validly tendered in the Tender Offer and accepted by the Company for purchase will be made on the date referred to as the "Settlement Date” or, in the case of Notes tendered through guaranteed delivery procedures, the "Guaranteed Delivery Settlement Date.” The Settlement Date is expected to occur November 25, 2019, and the Guaranteed Delivery Settlement Date is currently expected to occur on November 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>As described in the Offer to Purchase, tendered Notes may be withdrawn at any time on or prior to the earlier of (i) the Expiration Time and (ii) in the event that the Tender Offer is extended, the 10th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer; provided that Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer may also be withdrawn at any time after the 60th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer if for any reason the Tender Offer has not been consummated within 60 business days of commencement. Holders of the Notes are urged to carefully read the Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal and Notice of Guaranteed Delivery before making any decision with respect to the Tender Offer.</p>
      <p>The closing of the Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.</p>
      <p>The Company reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to (i) waive any and all conditions to the Tender Offer, (ii) extend the Expiration Time, (iii) amend the Tender Offer in any respect (including, without limitation, to change the fixed spread) or (iv) terminate the Tender Offer on or prior to the Expiration Time and return the Notes tendered pursuant thereto, in each case by giving written or oral notice of such extension, amendment or termination to Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the tender agent (in such capacity, the "Tender Agent”).</p>
      <p>If any Notes remain outstanding after the consummation of the Tender Offer, the Company expects (but is not obligated) to redeem such notes in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the related indenture.</p>
      <p>This press release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the Notes.

The Tender Offer is void in all jurisdictions where it is prohibited. In those jurisdictions where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the Tender Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Tender Offer will be deemed to be made on behalf of <a href="https://www.finanzen.net/aktien/the_western_union_company-aktie">The Western Union Company</a> by the Dealer Managers or one or more registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as dealer managers (together, the "Dealer Managers”) for the Tender Offer.
