      <h1>Jon Jones vs. Dominick Reyes set as the main event for UFC pay-per-view on Feb. 8</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:33:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>A light heavyweight title fight between reigning champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/47/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> and undefeated contender <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4111/dominick-reyes">Dominick Reyes</a> is currently in the works for a pay-per-view event expected to take place in Houston, Texas, on Feb. 8.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources confirmed the fight when speaking to MMA Fighting on Friday. News of the fight was first reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/CTaylor_96/status/1195809400474071040">BJPenn.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Jones has been teasing his return to action for the past week after declaring Reyes was the opponent he wanted to face next.</p>
      <p>Now he will attempt the third straight defense of his light heavyweight title as Jones looks to build on recent wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/164/alexander-gustafsson">Alexander Gustafsson</a>, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1091/anthony-smith">Anthony Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/938/thiago-santos">Thiago Santos</a>. Jones is 25-1 with one no contest in his career with the only loss on his resume coming via a disqualification back in 2009 when he was bludgeoning <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/45/matt-hamill">Matt Hamill</a> with elbows that were deemed illegal.</p>
      <p>While his career outside the Octagon has been marred by legal and drug testing issues, Jones is revered as arguably the greatest mixed martial artist of all time and he’ll attempt to prove that yet again when he returns in February.</p>
      <p>As for Reyes, the 29-year-old light heavyweight contender will try to stop Jones’ reign after starting his career with a perfect 12-0 record including six straight wins in the UFC.</p>
      <p>Reyes is coming off a first-round knockout against former middleweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/352/chris-weidman">Chris Weidman</a> in October and afterwards he immediately called for the next shot against Jones.</p>
      <p>Now it appears he will get his wish with Reyes expected to face Jones in the headliner of the upcoming event on Feb. 8 at Toyota Center. The flyweight title fight between Valentina Shevchenko vs. Katlyn Chookagian is expected to serve as the co-main event on the card.</p>
      <p>The number for the event hasn’t been determined yet as <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1086/ufc-246">UFC 246</a> is currently expected to happen on Jan. 18 in Las Vegas. Nothing has been finalized as the promotion continues to negotiate on the return of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> to headline that show. If McGregor returns at UFC 246, then the Feb. 8 card would become UFC 247.</p>
