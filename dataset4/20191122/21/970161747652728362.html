      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> refused to apologise for offensive language used in his journalism after being accused of contributing to ‘race hate’.</p>
      <p>The prime minister defended describing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> women wearing the burqa as looking like letterboxes, saying he was making a ‘liberal case for women being allowed to wear what they want.’</p>
      <p>Johnson was the last of four party leaders to take to the stage <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/general-election-2019/">during a BBC Question time special tonight</a>.</p>
      <p>An audience member asked: ‘You have contributed to race hate. Will you accept that and apologise?’</p>
      <p>He replied: ‘I have written many millions of words in my life as a journalist and I have… genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody’.</p>

      <p>The PM said he believed the question was a reference to an article in the Telegraph last year, when he was accused of Islamophobia for comparing Muslim women to letterboxes.</p>

      <p>However, presenter Fiona Bruce stepped in to remind him of a list of controversial things he has said before and during his political career – including notorious comments about ‘tank-topped bum boys’.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘To be fair, there’s a few articles. So there’s the Muslims going around looking like letterboxes, which was last year, you referred to tribal warriors with watermelon smiles and flag-waving pickaninnies and then just to get another demographic in, tank-topped bum boys.’</p>
      <p>The PM was laughed at when he tried to skirt the question by saying you can always find things ‘which may look offensive’ when taken out of context.</p>
      <p>He faced accusations  that he had ‘personally contributed’ to rampant racism in Britain but refused to apologise, saying: ‘I defend my right to speak out’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘If you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course I understand that.’</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson all came together to answer 30 minutes of questions from the Question Time audience before the PM was scrutinised.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson has previously faced calls to apologise for his notorious comments and has consistently remained defiant on the matter.</p>
      <p>However he said his party had ‘zero tolerance of Islamophobia’ and will have an inquiry into all forms of prejudice in the Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>Other issues he was grilled on include alleged Russian interference in British democracy, the NHS, and the importance of the ‘truth’.</p>
      <p>He said there was ‘no evidence’ of Russian interference and refused calls to publish a report on the matter.</p>
      <p>On the NHS, he said his conservative government were building 20 hospitals, which in time would raise to 40.</p>

      <p>These figures were called into question by Fiona Brunce, who said under the current spending plan the Tories could only afford to build six.</p>
      <p>The PM was met with cheers and jeers as he exited the stage.</p>
