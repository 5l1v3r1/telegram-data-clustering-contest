        <b>Bangladesh coach Russell Domingo said a practice game with the pink ball would have been ideal but offered no excuses for his team's batting capitulation on the opening day of their first day-night Test against India on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The touring side were shot out for 106 inside 31 overs with only three batsmen managing double-digit scores and they needed two concussion substitutes after Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan were struck on the helmet.</p>
      <p>Domingo defended his team's decision to bat first against India's formidable pace attack led superbly by Ishant Sharma who claimed 5-22.</p>
      <p>"We requested (a practice match) but in the current schedule, time was too tight," Domingo told reporters.</p>
      <p>"It was the same for both sides. We had four days of practise, but a warm-up game would have helped, to give the guys a bit more time with the pink ball. But this is no excuse."</p>
      <p>The South African was frank in his admission that his team would need to do a lot of catching up if they were to match Virat Kohli's India, the top-ranked Test side.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn’t say we were underprepared for the pink ball. India had similar time to train," Domingo said.</p>
      <p>"There’s a big difference between the two sides, regardless of six or seven days of preparation for the pink ball. We are a long way behind in Tests.</p>
      <p>"Virat Kohli has 26 Test hundreds while our whole team has 16 or 17. "It was not a 30-over all out wicket. There’s no doubt that we didn’t bat well enough."</p>
      <p>Nearly 60,000 fans packed into Eden Gardens to watch India's first day-night Test which has created quite a buzz in the eastern Indian city.</p>
      <p>Operating with the heavily-lacquered ball, India did a good job to bowl out Bangladesh inside three hours before finishing day one on 174-3.</p>
      <p>Ishant said the Indian quicks briefly struggled to hit the right length.</p>
      <p>"The pink ball was very different to the red ball," said the lanky right-armer.</p>
      <p>"When we started bowling at normal lengths, the ball was not swinging that much. We then figured out the length," Ishant added.</p>
      <p>"We talked about it among ourselves, the three fast bowlers, and started hitting the right lengths after that."</p>
