      <p>An individual with knowledge of the situation told Insider that apparel and accessories based on the popular character from <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111819_disney-plus-how-to-request-movies-tv-shows&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a>‘ “The Mandalorian” will be available through a number of sites, including <a href="https://target.com/">Target</a>, <a href="https://kohls.com/">Kohls</a>, <a href="https://www.macys.com/">Macys</a>, <a href="https://www.hottopic.com/homepage">HotTopic</a>, <a href="http://zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a>, and <a href="http://boxlunch.com/">BoxLunch.com</a> in the coming days.</p>
      <p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-apparel-accessories-toys-and-plush-are-coming.html?__source=sharebar">first reported the news</a> Thursday.</p>

      <p>On Friday, all Amazon links to “The Mandalorian” merchandise have been taken offline. Insider has reached out to Amazon and Disney for comment.</p>
      <p>Additional apparel will be available at Disney parks, the Disney Store, and <a href="https://www.shopdisney.com/">shopDisney</a> ahead of the holidays. If you’re hoping for a plush or toys of the little guy (or girl), those will be available for pre-order in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>The Baby Yoda rush won’t stop after the holidays. Even more toys, plush, specialty apparel, and more will be available in the coming months.</p>

      <p>The individual told Insider that Disney was “thrilled with the fan reaction” to the fan-dubbed Baby Yoda character and are excited to release the forthcoming apparel, accessories, toys, and more.</p>
      <p>Quickly after the first two episodes of the series premiered on Disney Plus, fans <a href="https://www.insider.com/best-baby-yoda-tweets-memes-the-mandalorian-2019-11">flooded social media with tweets and memes of the adorable nameless character</a>. In less than a week, the small Baby Yoda, who <a href="https://www.insider.com/mandalorian-first-episode-ending-meaning-star-wars-2019-11">we still don’t know much about</a>, united a fandom.</p>

      <p>The merchandise turnaround is a big surprise. Typically, big “Star Wars” and Marvel toy reveals are in development for anywhere from a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/star-wars-episode-8-hasbro-knew-han-solo-twist-2-years-ago-2016-6">year-and-a-half to two years</a> with companies.</p>
      <p>“The Mandalorian” creator Jon Favreau told <a href="https://twitter.com/AshCrossan/status/1196944836630200320">Entertainment Tonight’s Ash Crossan</a> that Disney and Lucasfilm agreed to hold off on marketing the adorable creature ahead of time in order to help keep the character a secret.</p>
      <p>“I have to thank Disney and Lucasfilm, because the way the cat usually gets out of the bag with that stuff is merchandising and toy catalogs and things like that,” Favreau said.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to have it be that you had to watch it yourself, so that every time you watch the show, there are new twists and secrets that come out,” he continued. “That requires a lot of restraint from the people who are footing the bill, saying that they’re gonna hold back on certain things so that the public doesn’t know ahead of time. Part of that was holding back on some of the merchandise.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Though the creature was kept out of early marketing, Disney must have anticipated how popular the character would be among fans. Since toys are often planned out at least a year in advance, this likely wasn’t a last minute order from Disney to make a holiday deadline, but a well-executed secret that had a very tight lid in order to give fans something special.</p>
      <p>How soon can you expect merchandise to be in physical stores?</p>
      <p>Insider stopped by a Target in New Jersey Thursday evening to see if the store was expecting any new “Star Wars” merchandise in the coming days. Several employees and a manager said they knew nothing about any more “Mandalorian” or Baby Yoda plushes or merchandise incoming yet. Insider was told anything should appear on Target.com first.</p>
      <p>The third episode of “The Mandalorian” will be available to stream on Friday on Disney Plus.</p>
