      <p>Guinness World Records has now ruled his dram treasure trove is the most expensive around the globe.</p>
      <p>The Vietnamese businessman told how it’s his “life’s passion” adding: “I’m really happy and feel honoured.</p>
      <p>“Every spare moment I get, I’m searching auction sites and trading websites to find famous and rare whiskies from around the world. I’m proud of my efforts.”</p>
      <p>Experts at Rare Whisky 101 valued his collection at a ‘hammer price’ of £10,770,635 — rising to £13,032,468 if it was to be sold through a UK auctioneer.</p>

      <p>He is believed to be one of only three collectors to own all three Macallan 1926 bottles — including the Fine and Rare label which recently sold for £1.2million.</p>
      <p>His haul also boasts one of only 12 bottles of the oldest Bowmore — worth £300,000.</p>
      <p>But Mr Viet, of Ho Chi Minh City, added: “I have no intention of selling any.</p>
      <p>“I’ll continue to hunt for more old and rare bottles and add to and enrich it.”</p>
      <p>Andy Simpson, co-founder of Rare Whisky 101, said: “We were gobsmacked when we realised the breadth and depth of Mr Viet’s collection.”</p>
