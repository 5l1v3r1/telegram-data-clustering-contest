      <p>The University of Queensland has been banned from holding a disciplinary hearing for a medical student accused of raping his classmate.</p>
      <p>The man, named as "Y" in court documents, is a final-year medical student at UQ and was due to sit his last exams this month before starting work as a doctor at a regional hospital in 2020.</p>

      <p>If the hearing found Y had breached the univeristy's misconduct policy, the student could have been expelled a month before graduating from his medical degree and would be unable to work as a doctor.</p>
      <p>In September, he was sent a letter by the university outlining sexual assault allegations believed to have happened during a clinical placement in a rural town in early 2018.</p>
      <p>The woman, named as "Z" in documents, had placed pillows between the pair in a bed they were sharing that Y removed, the university alleged.</p>
      <p>Without her permission, Y is accused of pulling her towards him and inserting his fingers into her anus.</p>
      <p>"Z pushed Y away and told him to leave the room," the university alleged.</p>
      <p>The man then removed his clothes, took off her clothes "then lay on top of Z and bit her body and inserted his fingers into her vagina".</p>
      <p>"Z told Y on several occasions to stop his actions, that he was hurting her, and told him to leave the room. [He] did not comply and continued to touch Z’s vagina."</p>
      <p>She asked him to leave, but he remained in the bed until morning.</p>
      <p>The man was set to appear before a disciplinary committee made up of students and academics in September, but his lawyers argued the university did not have jurisdiction to decide his innocence or guilt when the allegations could amount to a criminal offence.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ann Lyons agreed.</p>
      <p>Justice Lyons accepted it would be a "startling result if a committee comprised of academics and students who are not required to have any legal training could decide allegations of a most serious kind without any of the protections of criminal law".</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2019/QSC19-282.pdf">found the university</a> could take action on allegations of sex crimes only if the student had pleaded, or was found, guilty.</p>
