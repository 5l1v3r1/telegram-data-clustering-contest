      <p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> (aka Disney+) is finally available after years of waiting and dreaming. If you're in the United States, Canada or the Netherlands (and soon Australia and New Zealand), you can finally purchase a subscription to Disney+, and watch everything in the Disney vault. That includes franchises like <i>Star Wars</i> and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also includes the Pixar family of movies and, of course, everything from Disney proper, all for only $7 a month, which is truly a magical bargain.</p>
      <p>Only one thing remains, then: it's time to subscribe!</p>
      <h3>How to Sign Up for Disney Plus</h3>
      <p>Disney has tried to keep everything about Disney+ as easy as possible for potential users, and that includes getting signed up for your free trial. Whether you're trying to sign up on your laptop, phone, or even on your smart TV, the signup process takes less than a minute.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that while the Disney offers a free 7-day trial for the Disney+ service, you'll still have to give a credit card or PayPal account so that when your wonderful week of Disney freeness is up, you can be charged for your subscription.</p>
      <h4>How to sign up on the web</h4>
      <p>The easiest sign-up method is on the web, since after all, it's way easier to type in emails, passwords, and billing addresses on an actual keyboard instead of using a controller or remote on your smart TV.</p>
      <h4>A magical streaming service</h4>

      <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Disney — and more.</p>
      <p>Disney is finally bringing all of its content under one roof for streaming, after years of it being split on half a dozen services. Disney+ brings top-notch original content like <i>The Mandalorian</i> as well as timeless classics from Disney, Star Wars, National Geographic, Marvel, Disney Channel, and Fox.</p>

        <li>Tap <b>Start free trial</b> if you only want Disney+, or tap <b>Buy now</b> for the Disney+ bundle with Hulu and ESPN+.</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>email address</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Continue</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>desired password</b>. Your password needs at least six characters including a number or special character.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Continue</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>$6.99/month</b> or <b>$69.99/year</b>. (If you want to sign up for the Disney+ bundle, you'll need to use a computer instead.)</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>payment information</b>.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Agree &amp; subscribe</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Sign up via the Disney Plus app: Streaming devices, consoles, phones, tablets</h4>
      <p>Disney+ is available for a small army of devices, not just your phone or computer. Among the supported platforms are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Android phones and tablets</li>
        <li>Android TV devices</li>
        <li>Amazon Fire TV devices</li>
        <li>Google Chromecast</li>
        <li>Google Chromebooks</li>
        <li>Apple iOS phones and tablets</li>
        <li>Apple TV</li>
        <li>Desktop web browsers</li>
        <li>Xbox One</li>
        <li>Playstation 4</li>
        <li>Android-based Sony TVs</li>
        <li>Samsung smart TVs</li>
        <li>LG smart TVs</li>
        <li>Roku</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No matter which platform you're signing up on, the process is still the same, though it might take you a little bit longer to input your information using a remote on your smart TV. If you're signing up from an Android or Apple device, you have the option of having your service billed through Google Play or the Apple App Store.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <b>Disney+ app</b></li>
        <li>Select <b>Start Free Trial</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>email address</b>.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Continue</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>desired password</b>. Your password needs at least six characters including a number or special character.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Continue</b>.</li>
        <li>Select <b>$6.99/month</b> or <b>$69.99/year</b>. (If you want to sign up for the Disney+ bundle, you'll need to use a computer instead.)</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>payment information</b>.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Agree &amp; subscribe</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Add Disney Plus to an existing Hulu or ESPN+ plan</h4>
      <p>Even if you're already on Hulu or ESPN+, the sign-up process is the same, <b>but</b> you'll need to keep a few things in mind before you pull the trigger on your sign-up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Want any Hulu add-ons?</b> Once you've switched to the Disney+ bundle plan, you won't be able to add any Hulu add-ons to your account, but you can keep using — and paying for — the add-ons you're already subscribed to. You can cancel an add-on, but not get a new one once you're on the bundle, so if you've been debating getting the Limited Commercials add-on, now's your last chance!</li>
        <li><b>Keep your emails straight.</b> You have to use the same email for all three accounts, so if your existing Hulu account is in your email but the ESPN+ login uses your husband's email, one of you should change the email associated with those account so they match. It'll make things easier for you and hopefully avoid a call to customer support to try and straighten things out after you accidentally end up with a duplicate account.</li>
        <li><b>The Disney+ bundle doesn't have an annual billing option.</b> While this streaming trinity is already an impressive deal, if would be nice if you could save a bit more by ponying up for the whole year at once the way you can if you buy Disney+ and ESPN+ separately.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How much does Disney Plus cost?</h3>
      <p>Disney+ runs $7 a month plus tax in the United States, but you could shave a dollar and change off that if you opt for an annual billing cycle rather than a monthly billing cycle.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>If you're planning to keep Disney+ for the long haul, there's absolutely no reason not to go with the annual rate. It'll save you a few dollars and keep that recurring fee from showing up on every single credit card statement. It's the most sensible <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-free-price">pricing option</a> for Disney+ barring two options: if you're taking the Disney+ bundle with Hulu and ESPN+, or if you're a Verizon subscriber.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This Disney+ bundle is awesome even if you're not the biggest sports fan on the planet. Disney+ is $7 a month, ESPN+ is $5 a month, and basic Hulu is $6 a month, so this bundle essentially gives you ESPN+ for when you want to watch that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/all-sports-check-out-espn-when-you-get-disney-espn-and-hulu-bundle">random college game</a> or become a popular coworker and host a Fight Night watch party. This option also ensures that whatever Disney/Fox content is deemed "too adult for Disney+" you can still watch when it lands on Hulu.</p>
      <h4>Are there any discounts available?</h4>
      <p>The best discount on Disney+ so far is getting a year free. If you were one of the lucky ones to sign up for the D23 special back in August, you were able to buy three years of Disney+ service for the price of two, but if you weren't able to sign up then, there is another way to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-free-price">score a free year</a> of Disney+ through Verizon.</p>
      <p>Verizon's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know">Disney+ On Us promotion</a> offers a free year of service to certain groups of subscribers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New and existing 4G Unlimited mobile subscribers</li>
        <li>New and existing 5G Unlimited mobile subscribers</li>
        <li>New FiOS home internet subscribers</li>
        <li>New 5G home internet subscribers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It'd be a little bit crazy to switch carriers just to get a $70 subscription, but if you're in the market for a new wireless provider anyway, this promotion can help sweeten the pot, especially as we head into the hot, hot deals of the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <h3>What can I watch on Disney Plus?</h3>
      <p>Disney+ has far more than the classic animated films we grew up with. There are almost 500 films including most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), almost every Star Wars film, just about every Pixar film, classic films from 20th Century Fox like <i>The Sound of Music</i>, and of course hundreds of Disney live action and animated films from the Disney Vault.</p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, movies have been pretty easy to find and purchase online for the last decade, but the same can't be said of TV content, which is where Disney+ really shines for those of us that grew up on Disney Afternoon, DCOMs and classic Saturday day morning cartoons like <i>Recess</i>. This is especially true for Star Wars and Marvel shows, with Disney+ offering the most complete Marvel cartoon collection legally available for streaming. <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i> is even getting a new season on Disney+ this February.</p>
