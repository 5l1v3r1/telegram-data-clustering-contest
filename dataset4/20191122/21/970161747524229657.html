      <p>A medical examiner is in trouble for a gory job posting that included jokes about rotting corpses.</p>
      <p>Maine Chief Medical Examiner Dr Mark Flomenbaum’s 2017 posting for a new forensic pathologist apparently is a bit too lighthearted for lawmakers, who recently cited the posting in a complaint that calls into question Flomenbaum’s credibility.</p>
      <p>The job advertisement starts out like any other posting, saying the job presented a ‘wonderful opportunity to do excellent forensic pathology that is supported by a low stress and high level quality-of-life environment.’</p>
      <p>However, the posting takes an odd turn when Flomenbaum wrote that Maine is ‘a winter mecca for skiers, snowmobilers and other sportsmen,’ adding in bold lettering, ‘Translation: really short season of decomposed bodies.’</p>

      <p>Flomenbaum seemed to be joking about the long winters and short summers in Maine, which would be preferential for corpse preservation because bodies decompose more rapidly in the heat.</p>

      <p>He goes on to write that Maine has ‘vast waterways,’ adding ‘many bodies are lost at sea or wind up in either New Hampshire or Canada.’</p>
      <p>‘Only the bodies that really need to come in for autopsies will do so,’ he continues.</p>
      <p>In March the Office of the Maine Attorney General launched a review of Flomenbaum’s credibility and the forensic pathology consulting firm he runs as a side business,<a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/maine-medical-examiner-cited-short-season-of-decomposed-bodies-in-job-posting"> according to WGME</a>.</p>
      <p>The review comes after Flomenbaum was the subject of controversy earlier this year when a last minute change in an autopsy report he filed caused a <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2019/02/14/news/portland/mistrial-sought-in-maine-mans-murder-trial-after-medical-examiner-changes-story/">mistrial</a> in  the murder trial of Noah Gaston, who was charged killing his wife with a shotgun four years ago.</p>
      <p>Flomenbaum reportedly changed his initial opinion about critical evidence and the trial was rendered invalid through procedural error. Gaston was later convicted in a second trail.</p>
      <p>Another complaint was filed in Flomenbaum’s review involving a missing hiker found dead this summer. Flomenbaum ruled that the hiker died of a heart condition coupled with alcoholism, although two experts refuted that ruling.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers are citing Flomenbaum’s job ad as an example of his alleged lack of credibility.</p>
      <p>Evangelos wrote that the job posting was ‘beyond sick and makes jokes and light about deceased Mainers.’ The attorney general’s office said it plans to complete the review ‘in the near future.’</p>
