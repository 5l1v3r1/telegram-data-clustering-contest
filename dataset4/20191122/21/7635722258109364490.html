      <h1>Cooney stars as Ulster beat Clermont</h1>

        <b>John Cooney scored an excellent individual try as Ulster beat ASM Clermont-Auvergne 18-13 in their second Heineken Champions Cup pool game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The scrum-half had put in a Man of the Match display in their pool opener last Saturday as they <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/rugby/cooney-ulster-hard-work-bath-925943"><b>edged Bath</b></a> 17-16 at the Rec.</p>
      <p>And he stood out again from boot and general play at Kingspan Stadium.</p>
      <p>Ulster didn't wait long to get on the scoreboard. Within a minute, John Cooney converted a penalty to give the home side a 3-0 lead.</p>
      <p>They extended that lead on 17 minutes. A maul followed a line-out yards from the try-line. Clermont were powerless to stop Ulster's momentum and the Ireland international crossed over. Cooney added the extras to make it 10-0.</p>

      <p>Clermont thought they had scored a try of their own five minutes later. But referee JP Doyle ruled it out due to a knock-on in the build-up.</p>
      <h3>Cooney Magic</h3>
      <p>Cooney's half-back counterpart Greig Laidlaw reduced the arrears with a penalty on 32 minutes as the veteran Scottish international left the scores at 10-3.</p>
      <p>Another Cooney penalty restored Ulster's 10-point advantage although the ball struck the post on its way over.</p>
      <p>Clermont were unable to claw their way back closer on the scoresheet with the match still locked at 13-3 as the game ticked towards the hour mark.</p>
      <p>But the French side did convert another penalty on exactly 60 minutes as Laidlaw converted.</p>
      <p>However, Ulster would not allow that seven point gap to last long. A decisive break down-field saw Cooney chip forwards brilliantly before collecting his own kick-through and scoring Ulster's second try of the night.</p>

      <p>He missed his conversion from a wide angle but his try-scoring excellence had given his side a sizeable 18-6 cushion already with a quarter hour to play.</p>
      <p>However, Clermont showed resolve again as a penalty try brought the gap back down to 18-13 with 10 minutes still on the clock. But Ulster hung on for another valuable win.</p>
