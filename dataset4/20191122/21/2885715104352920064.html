      <p>The Union Health Ministry has asked AIIMS Delhi to review tuition fees for students and fix uniform user charges for patients in all its six institutes. The institute has also been entrusted with preparing a model rate chart which can be replicated in all six AIIMS across the country.</p>
      <p>The Central Institute Body (CIB) of the six AIIMS, in an order, has suggested a review of the tuition fee and user charges and asked all HoDs and chiefs of the centres to submit the details by November 25.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t seen the order… This is an internal review and, therefore, all the heads are asked to give details. The user charges are already applied in some centres,” Dr V K Bahl, Dean, told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
      <p>The administration has asked all its departments, sections, wings and facilities to submit details of charges levied in a particular format, which details the description of services, the current cost and the reasons for setting user charges lower than the current cost.</p>
      <p>“In pursuance to the directions of the Government of India (Ministries of Finance and Health), AIIMS, New Delhi, is required to review all fees and user charges of the institute,” an office memorandum read.</p>
      <p>AIIMS currently generates Rs 101 crore from user charges.</p>
      <p>According to officials, user charges have not been revised since 1996. An internal committee, constituted in 2017 to review user charges at the hospital, had recommended against charging money for tests and procedures which cost less than Rs 500.</p>
      <p>It had suggested that private ward charges at AIIMS be increased to make up for the loss.</p>
