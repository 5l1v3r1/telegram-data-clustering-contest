      <h1>How financial therapy can keep couples from splitting up</h1>

      <p>Fighting about money with your honey? See a financial therapist.</p>
      <p>These new specialists, who are the subject of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10591-019-09514-9">study published this month</a> in the journal Contemporary Family Therapy, do double-duty as experts in family issues and financial planning.</p>
      <p>For the study, researchers observed how six couples, aged 21 to 76, fared when they talked about their money woes with financial therapists. And — as you might guess if you’ve ever fought with a partner about credit-card splurges or cab fare home — the 30- to 50-minute sessions got pretty emotional.</p>
      <p>“One woman was close to tears listening to her husband explain an early memory in their relationship about money that she didn’t understand at the time,” says financial planner John Grable, a founding member of the Financial Therapy Association, in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/uog-ftc112119.php">press release</a>.</p>
      <p>“The story helped explain his odd behavior that she always thought of as just being mean. They left clearly closer emotionally and financially feeling more powerful.”</p>
      <p>The study’s lead author, University of Georgia couples and financial therapist Megan Ford, says finances are the “No. 1” thing couples fight about — which is why it’s strange that money and relationships aren’t researched more.</p>
      <p>“We know it and believe it,” Ford says, “but there is not a huge body of literature on the topic.”</p>
      <p>There also aren’t a lot of financial therapists. Study researchers found that, while there are more than 80,000 certified financial planners and 50,000 family therapists in the United States, there are only 50 certified financial therapists in the entire country.</p>
      <p>“Therapists need to work together to solve problems that occur around financial behaviors of couples and learn how to connect to all of their emotions,” says Ford.</p>
      <p>Of course, all of this is assuming that Americans can afford a financial therapist to begin with, what with college grads struggling with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/most-college-grads-consider-their-student-debt-a-life-sentence/">permanent-feeling student debt </a>and Americans struggling to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/many-cant-afford-to-take-vacations-this-season-study/">take vacations</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/the-holiday-season-puts-a-quarter-of-americans-into-debt/">put presents under the tree</a>.</p>
