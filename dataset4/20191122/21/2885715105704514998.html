      <p>A 35-year-old ex-Armyman was arrested by Delhi Police for allegedly posing as a high-ranking Army officer and extorting money from subedars and havaldars at railway stations.</p>
      <p>According to police, the accused, Hemant Kumar, would steal soldiers’ ID cards.</p>
      <p>“Kumar would go to railway stations and look for the military coach in trains. On finding young Armymen, he would pose as a Major or Captain and talk to them. To establish trust, Kumar would first pretend to use the washroom and give his belongings to the victim. Later, he would take the person’s Army ID and ATM cards on some pretext or the other,” said an officer.</p>
      <p>Police said that since Kumar had worked in the Army, he knew that losing the ID card is considered a punishable offence. Kumar would then contact the victim and ask for money.</p>
      <p>The officer said, “Fearing severe action by the Army, the victim would give him details of his ATM cards and the accused would withdraw money and return the cards.”</p>
      <p>Kumar had served in the Indian Army from 2001 to 2013. He was declared a ‘deserter’ due to his regular absenteeism and “lifestyle choices”. A senior police officer said, “Kumar’s father died during the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kargil-war/">Kargil War</a> in 1999. He was a Sepoy.”</p>
      <p>A Special Cell team, under the supervision of ACP Attar Singh, arrested Kumar from New Delhi railway station Thursday. In 2014 and 2015 as well, police had caught Kumar in similar cases.</p>
      <p>DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwah said that Kumar had cheated more than 10 Army personnel in the last two years.</p>
      <p>Recently, police said the accused had targeted a subedar at Anand Vihar railway station on October 15 and a havaldar at Nizamuddin railway station on October 25.</p>
      <p>Police said they recovered documents of Armymen, including ID cards, health cards, driver’s licences, from Kumar.</p>
