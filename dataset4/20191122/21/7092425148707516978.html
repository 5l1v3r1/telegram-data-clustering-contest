        <b>Harrison Ford is set to take on the first regular television role of his career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It sounds like a good one too. Ford is set to star in a TV adaption of The Staircase, the docuseries that detailed the trial of American novelist Michael Peterson, who was accused of murdering his wife in 2001.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/harrison-ford-the-staircase-series-1203411141/"><i>Variety</i></a> report that the project is currently being pitched to networks and streaming services.</p>
      <p>Peterson claimed his wife died after falling down the stairs at their home but police suspected he bludgeoned her to death and staged the scene to look like an accident.</p>
      <p>The docuseries was originally released in 2004 with creator Jean-Xavier de Lestrade adding new information to it years later.</p>
      <p>It was released on Netflix as a 13-episode series in 2018.</p>
      <p>Ford, 77, has appeared on TV before with appearances on a number of shows but this was before his film career took off.</p>
      <p>Antonio Campos will write and executive produce the series.</p>
      <p>His previous TV credits include the likes of The Sinner, and The Punisher. His film The Devil All The Time will be released in 2020 with a cast that includes Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland and Riley Keough.</p>
