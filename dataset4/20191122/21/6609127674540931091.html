        <b>TROUBLED EuroMillions winner Adrian Bayford has quit his mansion and moved to Scotland — to be near his ex.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ex-postie Adrian, 49, who scooped £148million in 2012, split from Gillian, 47, the following year because of the stress of the win.</p>

      <p>His love life has suffered ever since, with a string of relationships failing — including one with Samantha Burbidge, a stable hand 16 years his junior.</p>
      <p>But Adrian had always stayed close to Gillian and wants to see her and their two children regularly. So he has quit his £10million Suffolk estate and bought a four-bed detached<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4616391/euromillions-winner-gillian-bayford-mansion-home-worth/"> home in Dundee</a>.</p>
      <p>Pals said it is within walking distance of Gillian and the kids.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Adrian and Gillian might have divorced but he never really let go. He’s got such a big heart it’s a surprise it’s taken him this long to move.”</p>
      <h3>WINNER'S 'MONEY MISERY'</h3>
      <p>Removal vans were seen at the mansion this week before Adrian was driven to his new home by his parents.</p>
      <p>But friends said it was unclear what Gillian’s new hubby, convicted fraudster Brian Deans, thinks about the move.</p>
      <p>A pal said: “Adrian just packed up and went. He hasn’t been happy for a while.</p>
      <p>“He’s got all this money and he’s finally worked out what he wants to do with it all — be near his kids and their mum.</p>
      <p>“He’s glad to see the back of that mansion — it was just full of sad memories for him.</p>
      <p>“I think he only ever stayed there because he bought it with Gillian and it was a link to her and the kids when they were on the other side of the country.</p>
      <p>“He’s been through a string of break-ups there and people have taken advantage of him. The money made him lonely.</p>
      <p>“It had reached the stage where he was just sat around watching sport and eating.</p>
      <p>“That was never going to be enough for someone who loves his family as much as Adrian.”</p>
      <p>Adrian on Friday night said he had left the house. But he insisted he was not moving to Scotland and was instead planning to follow his earlier dreams of moving to Australia.</p>
