      <p>Former three-time Tour de France green jersey winner Robbie McEwen, who has seen the big improvement on the local cycling scene being a visitor the last six years, joins regular triathlon campaigners Piolo Pascual and Matteo Guidicelli in the non-competitive event which features the kids ride, short ride (20K) and long ride (40K) categories around Taguig, Makati, Manila and Pasay.</p>
      <p>“The Sun Life Cycle PH is getting bigger and better every year. I have watched the event grow and involve so many people from as young as two-years-old to serious elite cyclists, families and 60+ year olds,” said McEwen, also an Australian cycling legend and Olympiad veteran during yesterday’s launch of the event put up by Sun Life Financial Philippines and organized by Sunrise Events, Inc., now part of the IRONMAN Group.</p>
      <p>“This year, we have a large number of riders from PH Police, Army, Navy and Traffic Enforcement taking part in the 20km and 40km rides. The highlight, however, is always the kids ride on the closed circuit so they can get active and discover a love for biking,” he added.</p>
      <p>The event includes the tricycle ride (100-m distance for two- to three years olds), kids’ ride (500-m for 4-5 years old), the family ride (30-minute ride for 6-15 with adult companion) and the solo ride (30-minute ride for 6-15).</p>
      <p>McEwen, Pascual and Guidicelli, along with the other Star Magic artists, will see action in the long distance ride (40-km for 10 and above) of the event also held to further promote awareness on keeping a healthy lifestyle, diabetes prevention and helping less-privileged kids sustain their education.

      <p>The premier 40-km race will fire off at 6 a.m. at 9th cor. 30th Ave., BGC to Kalayaan Flyover to Gil Puyat Ave. to the turnaround point before Taft Ave. then back again to BGC, going through the course in three laps while the two-lap 20-km race, set at 6:20 a.m., will make a turnaround at Ayala Ave. and back to BGC.</p>
      <p>The kids ride (30 mins) and solo ride (6-15 years old) is set at 8:30 a.m. to be followed by the family ride at 9: 10 a.m., the trike ride (500 meters) at 9:45 a.m. and the trike ride (100 meters for 2-3 years old) at 9:55 a.m.</p>
