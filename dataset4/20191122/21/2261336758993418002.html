      <h1>ATT owner: Masvidal should choose superfight over title shot against UFC 245 winner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>A welterweight title shot against the winner of Kamaru Usman vs. Colby Covington might not be the next biggest fight available for Jorge Masvidal, according to American Top Team owner Dan Lambert.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.lowkickmma.com/dan-lambert-believes-masvidal-robbed-controversial-diaz-stoppage/">TheLowKickMMA’s Jon Fuentes</a> in a recent interview, Lambert said that, at this stage of his career, ‘Gamebred’ should choose a money fight against Conor McGregor or Canelo Alvarez should the opportunity present itself.</p>
      <p>“You know, I think if Jorge were 10 years younger, he’d probably be looking for a title fight next,” Lambert said. “I think at this stage in Jorge’s life and his career I think Jorge wants whatever makes him the most money. So I think Jorge is going to have to wait and see what his options are.</p>
      <p>“If Jorge had the opportunity to wait and fight a Conor McGregor, or if some of this talk gets legitimized about a potential boxing match with Canelo, and Jorge has the opportunity to go make that kind of money, I would strongly encourage Jorge to go grab that money. Because, you know, business, you never know what’s going to happen or when it’s going to happen. You got to grab it when you can.”</p>
      <p>Masvidal has gone from a relatively unknown UFC welterweight to one of the most popular fighters on the roster. The ex-street fighter has racked up three-straight stoppage wins over Darren Till, Ben Askren and Nate Diaz, beating the latter to win the UFC’s prized ‘BMF’ title earlier this month at UFC 244. The 35-year-old street fighting veteran also broke the record for the fastest KO in UFC history when he starched Ben Askren in just five seconds at UFC 239.</p>
      <p>Although Masvidal has expressed interest in a welterweight title shot, the American Top Team standout seems more interested in a possible superfight with Nick Diaz, telling the former Strikeforce welterweight champion that <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/18/20970636/ufc-mma-news-social-media-instagram-jorge-masvial-nick-diaz-fight">it would be an ‘honor’ to fight him</a>.</p>
      <p>UFC 245, which features Usman vs. Covington as the main event, takes place next month, Dec. 14 at T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas.</p>
