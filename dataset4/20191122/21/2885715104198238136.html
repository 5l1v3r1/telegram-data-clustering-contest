      <p>THE Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has directed the Gujarat government to conduct an inquiry into the deaths of exotic animals at Sardar Patel Zoological Park in Kevadia.</p>
      <p>Responding to a complaint filed on November 21 by Bhopal-based wildlife activist Ajay Dubey, the CZA in its letter to Gujarat chief wildlife warden asked the state government to inquire into the deaths of the exotic animals and send the report to the CZA.<br/>A giraffe and two impala had died of peracute mortality syndrome at the park on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>At least four more exotic ungulate specie of animals are said to have died ahead of its scheduled inauguration by Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> on October 31. The inauguration, however, did not take place that day.</p>
      <p>The complaint sent to the CZA on November 21 states that a large number of exotic animals that have been brought to Kevadia have died. “This is a grave violation of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 in PM’s home state Gujarat,” states the complaint.</p>
      <p>The letter addressed to the chief wildlife warden from the CZA on Friday states, “CZA received a complaint on the deaths of the exotic animals at the Sardar Patel Zoological Park, Kevadia on November 21. Kindly inquire into the case and send a report for necessary action to CZA.”</p>
      <p>The letter has been sent by the CZA through post as well as e-mail.</p>
      <p>However, when contacted, the Gujarat chief wildlife warden Shyamal Tikadar said, “I have not received any letter to inquire into the deaths of the exotic animals from the CZA.”</p>
