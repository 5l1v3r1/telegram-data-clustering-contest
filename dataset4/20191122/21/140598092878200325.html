      <h1>Sacha Baron Cohen hits out at social media 'propaganda'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:05:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-allen/" target="_blank">Nick Allen</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sacha-baron-cohen/">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> has called social media companies "the greatest propaganda machine in history" for spreading hate, suggesting Facebook would have allowed Adolf Hitler to buy political adverts promoting the "final solution."</p>
      <p>The actor and comedian accused <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/facebook/">Facebook</a>, Google, YouTube, Twitter, and others, of putting business success above the safety of their users.</p>
      <p>He called for them to be regulated, and classified as publishers, making them responsible for the fake news they spread, and forcing them to fact-check political adverts.</p>
      <p>Speaking after accepting an award from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in New York, Baron Cohen called arguments used by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, that he was protecting free speech, "absurd and ludicrous."</p>
      <p>He accused  the platforms, including Facebook, of allowing hateful content because it provoked a response and improved engagement.</p>

      <p>Baron Cohen, who is Jewish, said: "Lies spread faster than truth. As one headline put it, just think what Goebbels could have done with Facebook.</p>
      <p>"If you pay them, Facebook will run any ‘political’ ad you want, even if it’s a lie. And they’ll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect.</p>
      <p>"Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his ‘solution’ to the 'Jewish problem'."</p>
      <p>Baron Cohen said demagogues around the world were using the platforms to appeal to people's worst instincts, conspiracy theories were going mainstream, and scientific consensus was being dismissed.</p>
      <p>He said: "Hate crimes are surging, as are murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities. What do all these dangerous trends have in common? I'm just a comedian and an actor, not a scholar, but one thing is pretty clear to me.</p>
      <p>"All this hate and violence is being facilitated by a handful of internet companies that amount to the greatest propaganda machine in history."</p>
      <p>A Facebook spokesman rejected the claims, saying: "Sacha Baron Cohen misrepresented Facebook’s policies. Hate speech is actually banned on our platform.</p>
      <p>"We ban people who advocate for violence and we remove anyone who praises or supports it. Nobody – including politicians – can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook."</p>
      <p>They also  pointed to recent comments by Mr Zuckerberg about taking down hateful content.</p>
      <p>In a speech Mr Zuckerberg said: "We take down content that could lead to real world violence. In countries at risk of conflict, that includes anything that could lead to imminent violence or genocide.</p>
      <p>"And we know from history that dehumanising people is the first step towards inciting violence."</p>
      <p>He added: "If you say immigrants are vermin, or all Muslims are terrorists, that makes others feel they can escalate and attack that group without consequences.</p>
      <p>"So we don’t allow that. I take this incredibly seriously, and we work hard to get this off our platform."</p>
