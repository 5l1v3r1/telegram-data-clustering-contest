      <p>(Reuters) - Apple Inc is delaying the planned December movie theater release of movie “The Banker,” one of its first original films, a source close to the company said on Friday, amid ongoing concerns about the period drama.</p>
      <p>The movie’s debut on Apple’s newly launched streaming service Apple TV+ will also likely be delayed, the source said.</p>
      <p>No new dates for the release of the film were given.</p>
      <p>“The Banker” was supposed to go into a limited number of U.S. movie theaters on Dec. 6, and onto the streaming platform in January.</p>
      <p>However Apple canceled the planned Nov. 21 world premiere saying it was investigating unspecified concerns.</p>
      <p>“Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention,” Apple said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing the cancellation of the world premiere. “We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.”</p>
      <p>Apple has given no details of its concerns.</p>
      <p>“The Banker” is based on the real-life story of two African-American businessmen in the 1960s who sought to help people overcome racial barriers in banking. The movie stars Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson.</p>
      <p>Apple has been buying movies to feed Apple TV+, the subscription video streaming service that the iPhone maker launched this month.</p>
