      <p>Authorities arrested more than 80 people during a night-time protest in the Algerian capital, a prisoners' rights group said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators have been protesting against next month's presidential election which they allege aims to cement in power a political elite linked to former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika.</p>
      <p>Bouteflika quit in April after popular pressure.</p>
      <p>The CNLD prisoners' rights committee said most of those detained in Thursday night's protest were taken to police stations in the suburbs of Algiers.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of Algerians had turned out for the second night in a row to voice their anger over the presidential poll set for December 12.</p>
      <p>They did so hours after an examining magistrate charged 29 people arrested during a similar protest on Wednesday night with holding an "unauthorised gathering".</p>
      <p>Five candidates are to contest next month's election after the ailing Bouteflika, 82, was forced to step down after mass demonstrations in February against his bid for a fifth term.</p>
      <p>Algeria has since seen weekly protests demanding major reforms to a political system that has been in place since independence from France in 1962.</p>
      <p>On Friday, several hundred people had already gathered in central Algiers hours before the start of the 40th weekly protests, journalists posted on social networks.</p>
      <p>Dozens of people have been arrested since the election campaign began last Sunday. Four were sentenced on Monday to 18 months in jail and 14 received suspended terms for disrupting a meeting.</p>
      <p>"This is a campaign of repression, not an election campaign," chanted protesters seen in video footage released online by the independent news site TSA.</p>
