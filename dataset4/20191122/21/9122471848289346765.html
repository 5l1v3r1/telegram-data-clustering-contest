      <h1>LSU vs. Arkansas: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:34:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>LSU retained its No. 1 spot after beating Ole Miss last weekend, though the game was probably a bit more competitive than many thought it would be. Arkansas shouldn’t provide as much of a challenge this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Razorbacks have been the worst team in the SEC over the last few years. The team made the decision to move on from head coach Chad Morris before the end of his second season.</p>
      <p>Under Morris, the former Clemson offensive coordinator who got SMU back to respectability, Arkansas struggled with most Group of Five teams, and failed to win an SEC game. LSU should have this one in hand by halftime.</p>
      <p>The Tigers aren’t without things to prove, though. It is unclear how much any game against Arkansas can help a team, but last weekend’s Ole Miss game wasn’t too encouraging on the defensive side, which is maybe the biggest concern of any of the three main College Football Playoff contenders right now. The Rebels <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/lsu/ed-orgeron-has-a-message-for-critics-of-lsus-defense">scored 37 on the Tigers</a>, putting up over 600 total yards, including 400 on the ground.</p>
      <p>Arkansas’ offense is ranked <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28099946/sp+-rankings-week-12-battle-1-loss-teams">96th in the country per SP+</a>, so Saturday’s game shouldn’t tell us too much.</p>

      <p>LSU is in incredibly good shape for the College Football Playoff, barring a major hiccup to end the season here. Wins over Texas, Florida, Auburn, and Alabama are hard to top, and are the basis for the resume that has LSU at No. 1 right now.</p>
      <p>The Tigers finish up with the Razorbacks, followed by a decent if unremarkable Texas A&amp;M team to finish the regular season. Barring a collapse, a date with Georgia in the SEC Championship follows that. LSU may be able to afford a loss and still make it, but obviously they’ll want to play it safe and win out to lock up a College Football Playoff bid.</p>
