      <h2>Luxury group prepares to reopen landmark La Samaritaine after €750m restoration</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:00:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Pooler</a></address>
      <p>On the right bank of the River Seine in central Paris stands a landmark that evokes what the 19th century novelist Emile Zola described as a “cathedral of modern commerce”.</p>
      <p>Almost 15 years since shutting its doors to the public after being deemed unsafe, La Samaritaine department store will reopen in April following a €750m renovation by the LVMH luxury empire controlled by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/21f64410-9117-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271">Europe’s richest man</a>, Bernard Arnault.</p>
      <p>One of the French capital’s <i>grands magasins</i>, the 150-year-old institution is an architectural showpiece that has designs from both the art deco and art nouveau eras. Among the restored features are a vast glass roof, frescoes of peacocks, decorative wrought-iron railings and the store’s iconic mosaic sign.</p>
      <p>The revamped La Samaritaine will also host restaurants and a five-star boutique hotel from LVMH’s Cheval Blanc brand, with views on to the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame cathedral, prices starting at €1,150 a night — and even a penthouse suite with its own private swimming pool.</p>
      <p>As online shopping grinds down many stalwarts of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e8329ee-5a8d-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a">high street</a>, LVMH is banking on affluent tourists whom it expects to account for more than half of sales. Eléonore de Boysson of DFS, the group’s travel retail arm that will operate the premises, said it would offer an “unforgettable authentically French experience”.</p>

      <p>“We have a very competitive market in Paris, so we have to differentiate ourselves,” she added. “We will be the smallest of the <i>grands magasins</i>, or, if you prefer, the biggest of the concept stores.”</p>
      <p>Despite the woes of other department store brands left behind by changing consumer habits, from Sears and Barneys in the US to House of Fraser and Debenhams in the UK, the format is not dead — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57109218-b742-11e8-b3ef-799c8613f4a1">at least in France</a>. La Samaritaine’s rebirth follows a new Galeries Lafayette store inside an art deco bank on the Champs-Elysées, which opened in March and is targeting well-heeled Parisians.</p>
      <p>While overall fashion retail sales in France fell by 3.6 per cent between 2015 and last year, the <i>grand magasins</i> bucked that trend with a modest increase of 2 per cent, according to the Institut Français de la Mode. Gildas Minvielle, a director at the Paris fashion school, put this down to a mixture of reinvention — through exclusive collections, pop-ups and cultural collaborations — and appealing more to overseas visitors.</p>
      <p>“The positioning of the department stores has been changing in the last 15 years or so. It used to be more middle-range in the past. Now they have focused their strategy on fashion and the range of prices is quite high — it’s more premium,” he said.</p>
      <p>La Samaritaine was founded in 1870 by former street hawker Ernest Cognacq. Along with fellow <i>grands magasins</i> Printemps, Galeries Lafayette, and LVMH-owned Le Bon Marché, it epitomised the dazzling allure of early consumerism as immortalised in Zola’s 1883 work <i>Au Bonheur des Dames.</i></p>
      <p>Its glory days came in the 1920s as a vendor of fashion, drapery, flowers, musical instruments and wine, before its fortunes began to fade from the 1970s. LVMH acquired a 55 per cent stake in 2001, but four years later La Samaritaine was closed after the police found it to be a fire hazard. LVMH took full control of it in 2010.</p>

      <p>Delays to the long-awaited refurbishment were partly because of the need to convince local authorities of its merits, as well as legal wrangles with opponents, who claimed the makeover offended the area’s Haussmann-style architecture. New additions include a facade on one building consisting of etched wavy glass, a spa, and offices. There will also be a children’s crèche and 96 low-rent apartments, following discussions with the city’s socialist town hall.</p>
      <p>Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, said that landmark department stores like La Samaritaine could prosper if they succeeded in carving out a “meaningful niche”.</p>
      <p>“Harrods, for example, is a destination for very fortunate consumers wanting to find the best of the best,” he added. “Galeries Lafayette is a magnet for Chinese tourists looking for the best Paris and France have to offer. Bon Marché is already prominent, primarily with Parisian consumers. I wonder what the mission of La Samaritaine will be, knowing that their location is second to none.”</p>

      <p>The revival of this symbol of conspicuous consumption, just a few minutes’ walk from the Louvre Museum, is inauspicious in its timing. Discontent with stagnant living standards in France exploded in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b1cadae6-f942-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c">gilets jaunes protests</a> that began a year ago, causing disruption and disorder in the capital on consecutive Saturdays.</p>
      <p>This was a factor in fashion retail sales dropping 1.3 per cent in the first nine months of 2019, according to the Institut Français de la Mode. The <i>grands magasins</i> were not immune from a slowdown and contracted 0.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>Although LVMH has not disclosed revenue forecasts, the aim is for La Samaritaine to turn a profit — something it has struggled to do at times in the past.</p>
      <p>Many of the brands its stocks will be LVMH’s own. The world’s largest luxury group by revenues generated €47bn in sales last year and encompasses everything from Louis Vuitton handbags to Moët &amp; Chandon champagne. If Mr Arnault gets his way, it will also include diamonds from Tiffany &amp; Co. This week LVMH <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d871ec16-0bde-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">increased its bid</a> to almost $16bn for the American jeweller, whose Manhattan store was captured in Truman Capote’s 1958 novella, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</i>.</p>
