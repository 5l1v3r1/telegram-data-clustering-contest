      <h1>Open defecation: FG tasks State Governors on Executive Order</h1>

      <p>As part of efforts to curb the menace of open defecation across the country, the Federal Government on Friday called on State Governors to emulate President Muhammadu Buhari and sign Executive Orders so as to meet the 2025 target.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Water Resources, Engr. Suleiman Adamu, in his keynote address at the 26th Regular Meeting of the National Council on Water Resources in Minna, Niger State, said it is necessary because the bulk of the people do not live in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, but in the states and local governments.</p>
      <p>Adamu said the 36 states and 744 Local Government Areas would determine the success of the campaign against Open Defecation by President Buhari.</p>
      <p>According to him: “All states have to key into this target of open defecation elimination by year 2025. </p>
      <p>“The governors have to sign the Executive Order in their states just as President Buhari did so as to address the menace.</p>
      <p>“The Executive Order against Open Defecation by Mr. President cannot work without the involvement of both states and local governments in the country. </p>
      <p>“The Federal Government will also need the involvement of community leaders, religious leaders, market women, in all strata of the society where people practice this bad open defecation. </p>
      <p>“This campaign is for everyone. </p>
      <p>“It’s everybody’s business to support it.”</p>
      <p>Adamu further added that after the meeting, whatever decision reached by the council, “the states will deal with their own, while the Federal Ministry of Water Resources handles its own.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to journalists, the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, commended the Ministry of Water Resources for organising the programme, describing the timing as very apt.</p>
      <p>The governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Ahmed Matane, explained that the state is fully committed to the water and hygiene policy of the Federal Government, saying: “Niger State stands to benefit more from anything that has to do with water in the country.</p>
      <p>“We have already endorsed the protocol for the Effective, Water, Sanitizer and Hygiene Services, supported by USAID for the people of the state. </p>
      <p>“We are also committed to providing all the necessary framework for the water policy put in place by the Federal Government.”</p>
