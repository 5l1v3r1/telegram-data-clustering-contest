      <h1>Bristol Bears demolish Brive to send a warning to their European Challenge Cup rivals</h1>
      <h2>Pat Lam's side scored five tries without reply at the Stade Amédée-Domenech</h2>

      <p>Bristol Bears ransacked one of French rugby’s fortresses on Friday night in a performance which was a real statement of intent in the European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>If you are going to come out and stay you want to win the competition you need to lay down markers like this.</p>
      <p>The Bears tore newly promoted Top 14 side Brive apart at times to humiliate them on the scoreboard in front of their own fans, winning 0-36 to comprehensively go top of Pool 4.</p>
      <p>Travelling to France in the European Cup is meant to be difficult for English sides. Bristol were dropping balls in the warm-up in the rain like they had soap on their hands.</p>
      <p>And yet for the majority of the first 40 minutes at the Stade Amédée-Domenech Bristol put on a masterclass of first attacking rugby and then defensive grit.</p>
      <p>The visitors opened the scoring just six minutes into the encounter with a fine individual finish from Toby Fricker, showing his trademark tenacity to out-wrestle a bigger defender and touch the ball down when he had no right to do so.</p>
      <p>The second try 10 minutes later was a work of art. Luke Morahan started the attack by ghosting away on the outside before offloading to Steven Luatua who loves to lurk in the wide channels - pity the defending wingers. The skipper was brought down but the ball was quickly recycled and Callum Sheedy floated through a gap, dummied a couple of Brive defenders before passing to Harry Randall for practically a walk in.</p>

      <p>There was no let up from the Bears and in the 24th minute Piers O’Conor was over for the third of the half, touching down at the back of a driving maul which saw the backs pile in to add some extra power.</p>
      <p>The emperious Sheedy converted all three scores as well as a penalty to make it 24-0 with as many minutes on the clock.</p>
      <p>The famously loud French crowd was silent.</p>
      <p>But the hosts got themselves back into the game through a couple of moments of indiscipline from the Bears, with the robust Sam Bedlow riding up high in a tackle and then chasers straying in front of the kicker.</p>
      <p>That handed Brive lineouts close to the Bristol line to launch attacks through their giant forwards. But this is not the Bears side which got tenderised by the big La Rochelle forwards in last season’s quarter-final defeat - and in due respect this Brive side is not of the same class as their countrymen from the West coast either.</p>
      <p>The visitors simply refused to be scored on, holding out for double figures of phases just inches from their own try line to keep the hosts out before the break; eventually forcing a knock on.</p>
      <p>This young Bears side completed the job in the second half but not until the final 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Giant Brive winger Sevanaia Galala was shown a yellow card for a high tackle on O’Conor, and then talking back to referee Craig Evans, and with Brive a man short the floodgates opened, with Will Capon touching down at the bottom of a 13-man maul having just joined the action and Ed Holmes finishing a late break to end the contest in style.</p>
      <p>Sheedy landed all but the final conversion attempt to finish with an individual tally of 11 points.</p>
