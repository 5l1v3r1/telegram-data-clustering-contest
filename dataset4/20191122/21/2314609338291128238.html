      <p>A Gold Coast massage parlour whose online listing said it would "put that spring back in your step" and clients should "ask about our special full Thai massage" is now known as a "prohibited brothel".</p>
      <p>The online listing for 'Body Back and Feet Massage' at Ashmore said "no sexual services offered", but detectives have charged one employee with "providing illegal sexual services".</p>

      <p>It is the first time in Queensland's history the prohibited brothel declaration has been issued, despite police having made several previous applications made to magistrates.</p>
      <p>The Ashmore business was raided by local detectives along with federal police and border force officers in September, following a four-month investigation into three Gold Coast massage parlours.</p>
      <p>Five employees from the three business were charged with prostitution offences, including one employee from 'Body Back and Feet Massage'.</p>
      <p>"For the ultimate in personal, full-body relaxation on the Gold Coast," the <i>Go4it</i> online listing said.</p>
      <p>"Our professional therapist will bring you back to life and put that spring back in your step.</p>
      <p>"Call today and ask about our special full Thai Massage. No appointment necessary.</p>
      <p>"No sexual services offered."</p>
      <p>The declaration, made under the Prostitution Act 1999, was posted on the 'Body Back and Feet Massage' business this week.</p>
