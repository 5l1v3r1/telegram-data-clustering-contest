        <b>The track comes from a new compilation of Tom Waits covers by female artists</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/PHOEBE-BRIDGERS">Phoebe Bridgers</a> has released a cover of Tom Waits’ ‘Georgia Lee’, taken from a new tribute compilation ‘Come On Up To The House: Women Sing Waits’.</p>
      <p>The album, produced by Warren Zanes, also features Aimee Mann, Rosanne Cash, and the duo of Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer singing the songs of Tom Waits.</p>
      <p>‘Georgia Lee’ was originally released on Waits’ 1999 album ‘Mule Variations’. The song is based on a true story about an impoverished black girl who, in 1997, was abducted and murdered at the age of 12: <i>“Why wasn’t God watching / why wasn’t God listening / why wasn’t God there for Georgia Lee?”</i> Listen to Bridgers’ version below.</p>

      <p>Last month (October 30) <a href="https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/phoebe-bridgers-new-album-interview-the-1975-mirrors-festival-2561669">Bridgers spoke to <i>NME</i></a> during a break in recording ahead of debuting new music from the record for the first time at <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/mirrors-festival-2019-review-phoebe-bridgers-american-football-alfie-templeman-sheer-mag">Mirrors Festival in London</a>. “Those projects have made me feel like the boss of my own music in the best way. I’m not afraid to have a really weird idea or, you know, take a really bad guitar solo,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I think the main thing which boygenius and I talk about ad nauseam, is that I feel like I just apologise for myself less. I’m not afraid to have a really weird idea or, you know, take a really bad guitar solo. I’m unafraid of getting made fun of anymore. I feel like both of those projects have made me feel like the boss of my own music in the best way.”</p>
