      <p>Ms Davidson finally confirmed she’d stand down as an MSP in 2021 as she revealed she’s “terrified” of having a “real job”.</p>
      <p>The ex-BBC reporter sparked laughter as she listed politicians who had similar career paths: "Winston Churchill, a journalist who became possibly our greatest ever Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>"Michael Foot, lauded editor of the Evening Standard, who led the opposition.</p>
      <p>"And Boris Johnson who got sacked by The Times.”</p>
      <p>The PM was axed for making up a quote about the discovery of Edward II’s long-lost palace.</p>
      <p>Ms Davidson also told the charity lunch as a rookie journo 20 years ago she called Nicola Sturgeon before 8am every Sunday “out of badness”.</p>
      <p>She added: “I’ve always had a grudging admiration for her work ethic.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Ms Davidson was under pressure to quit as an MSP after she took a <a href="http://bit.ly/2DaZ5qo">£50k-a-year PR advisor role</a>.</p>
      <p>She was set to bag the extra cash for <a href="http://bit.ly/2DaZ5qo">just 24 days of work</a> for Tulchan Communications.</p>
      <p>But after challenging MSPs <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4883361/ruth-davidson-pr-job-msps-report-watchdog/">to report her to watchdogs</a> if they believed her lobbying firm job broke Holyrood rules - she <a href="http://bit.ly/2Ox2J3i">quit her position with Tulchan</a>.</p>
