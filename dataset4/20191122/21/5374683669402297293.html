      <h1>Jordan's King: Relations with Israel worse than ever</h1>
      <h2>King Abdullah II says two-state solution is only way to solve Israeli-Arab conflict, warns: "This is the final opportunity."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:34:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author">Elad Benari, Canada</a></address>
      <p>King Abdullah II of Jordan said on Friday that relations between Jordan and Israel are worse than ever, partly because of issues related to the situation in Israel.</p>
      <p>The King, who spoke at a conference in New York, added, “I hope Israel can determine its future in the coming weeks and months.”</p>
      <p>He also stressed that the so-called “two-state solution” is the only solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs and warned, "This is the final opportunity, every passing year will further complicate the situation.”</p>
      <p>Jordan is one of only two Arab countries, along with Egypt, to have a peace deal with Israel. However, the country’s parliament, which is made up mostly of Islamists, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/187671">remains anti-Israel</a> and its members have more than once called to annul the peace treaty.</p>
      <p>In March, a group of Jordanian lawmakers <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/260564">called for the expulsion</a> of the Israeli ambassador from the kingdom in response to what they termed "ongoing Israel aggression" at holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>In August, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/267610">Jordan's parliament recommended</a> the country expel Israel's ambassador, recall the Jordanian ambassador to Israel, and re-examine the peace agreement between the two countries.</p>
      <p>Decisions on cancelling the peace treaty, signed in 1994, can only be made by the King.</p>
