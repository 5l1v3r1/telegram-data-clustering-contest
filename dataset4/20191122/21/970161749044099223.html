        <b>Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) was elated in EastEnders when Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) finally put an end to their dodgy business arrangement, but little did he know that his problems were about to get a whole lot worse, as he encountered a man named Jerome (Chris Charles), who was revealed to be friend of wife Stacey’s (Lacey Turner). However, there was more to this than meets the eye — and Martin was left devastated when he discovered the truth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, with Ben <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-gives-up-his-dodgy-dealings-for-boyfriend-callum-highway-11197245/">attempting to turn over a new leaf</a> as a result of boyfriend Callum’s (Tony Clay) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-horrified-as-callum-highway-reveals-he-wants-to-join-the-police-11066923/">desire to become a police officer</a>, he put an end to his business arrangement with Martin once and for all.</p>
      <p>Viewers will know that the young lad has made the fruit-and-veg stall holder’s life a living hell over the past few months. Yes — between <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-is-punched-yet-again-as-martin-fowler-lashes-out-10894676/">making him collect money</a>, to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-as-ben-mitchell-goes-to-extreme-lengths-to-get-revenge-on-martin-fowler-after-his-betrayal-10981669/">holding him over the railway bridge</a> — Ben has went to extreme lengths to assert his authority over Martin.</p>

      <p>With his nightmare at an end, Martin was chuffed — especially when Ben revealed that Stacey was free to return home to Walford. As a result, he wasted little time in attempting to get in touch with his wife to share the good news with her.</p>

      <p>However, after he failed to do so, he headed round to the Slaters to get to the bottom of what was going on — and he was left devastated to discover that Jean (Gillian Wright) and Mo (Laila Morse) had packed up Stacey’s belongings.</p>
      <p>As Martin tried to get them to spill the beans on what was happening, a mystery man named Jerome showed up, and it soon became apparent that he’s in a relationship with Stacey.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Martin was devastated, and as he struggled to control his temper as a result, which led to Kush (Davood Gahdami) coming to his aid.</p>

      <p>After Jerome had left, Martin revealed the truth to Jean, but the Slater icon was having none of it, and didn’t hold back when it came to hurling out insults at her son-in-law.</p>
      <p>A distraught Martin proceeded to get drunk in E20 — so much so that he could barely stand. As he walked through the Square, he collapsed outside the Beale household — just as Ben happened to be exiting the property.</p>
      <p>Shockingly, Ben voiced his concern over Martin’s apparent state, but the fruit-and-veg stall holder wasted little time in blaming him for everything that’s happened.</p>

      <p>As a result, he lashed out and punched Ben for the 475th time, before attempting to get another right hook in for good measure — but he missed, and thus collapsed to the floor.</p>
      <p>As Ben headed off down the Square, Martin accused him of ruining his life.</p>

      <p>Is this the end of Stacey and Martin?</p>
      <p>The young man’s life has been turned upside down in a matter of months, and it’s all thanks to Ben.</p>
      <p>Will he seek revenge?</p>
