      <h1>Olo Rolls Out Food Ordering Trial In BMW Vehicles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:03:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>To help diners purchase their favorite foods from <a href="https://www.portillos.com/">Portillo’s Hot Dogs</a> and <a href="https://www.nekterjuicebar.com/">Nekter Juice Bar</a>, food ordering platform <a href="https://www.olo.com/">Olo</a> is testing out in-car ordering. Consumers can order from the restaurants directly from BMV vehicles through the end of the year, according to an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005073/en/Olo-Pilot-Brands-Experiment-In-car-Ordering-Trial/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-fArZ4S48GqIjCUpbTPJDg_ZRHqeOKdIRBEENMvWuUUmOKZXz2bZRmEQ1BwkpoG4oul5C1rkGQ_h4BkZ40LwsoN4gnxBSGiVu_qLafVdV0IiQPT0fDRifTq3nSfcMpa1LQ==">announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>Jackie Berg, VP of marketing at Olo, said in the announcement, “Ordering lunch from the car with a push of a button – we’re living in the future!” She continued, “The convergence of commerce and convenience is opening up exciting potential for restaurants, and we are thrilled to work with BMW and our pilot brands to experiment with how in-car ordering will evolve and shape how consumers order.”</p>
      <p>Portillo’s and Nekter Juice Bar are the first live brands to participate in the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/commerce-connected/2019/qsr-mobile-ordering/">in-car ordering</a> pilot. BMW owners can send orders to locations across the country directly from their vehicles by visiting the BMW Labs website. The pilot, according to the announcement, is “an R&amp;D exploration of how the guest experience can translate to an in-car setting.”</p>
      <p>The pilot is available for <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2019/bmw-tencent-china-self-driving-tech/">BMW</a> vehicles from model year 2015 and later. Vehicle compatibility will be checked when users access the BMW Labs website throughout the remainder of the year.</p>
      <p>According to the announcement, “the online ordering experience is designed for easy pre-configuration of orders, making saved favorites and repeat orders easy.” Participants in the trial can order and pay with the push of a button and can follow driving directions to retrieve their orders.</p>
      <p>Steve Schulze, co-founder and CEO of Nekter Juice Bar, said in the announcement, “Since day one at Nekter Juice Bar, it’s been our mission to make our menu of fresh and nutritious juices, superfood smoothies and acai bowls easily accessible to everyone on their individual paths to wellness. Collaborating with innovative and forward-thinking brands such as <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/amazon-alexa/2018/bmw-personal-voice-assistant-car-technology/">BMW</a> and Olo will help us expand this accessibility while also supporting our speed-of-service initiatives for people on the go.”</p>
