      <h1>Shamed Prince Andrew 'forced to move private office out of Buckingham Palace'</h1>
      <h2>The Duke of York has reportedly been told to take his staff to different premises in a move approved by the Queen amid the scandal that has hit the royal family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:52:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew is being forced to move his private office out of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/buckingham-palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/emily-maitlis-my-interview-with-prince-andrew-8hhclpwcf">The Times</a> reports the move has been approved by the Queen and that he's been told to move his staff out as well.</p>
      <p>This comes after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Duke of York</a> was left further embarrassed today as Barclays - a major sponsor of his Pitch@Palace pet project - dumped him over the scandal.</p>
      <p>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the English National Ballet also announced his resignation as patron with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>High profile business sponsors KPMG, Standard Chartered and Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company, have all said they will not be renewing their financial support for his flagship business project Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>Andrew was expected to travel to the Bahrain this weekend as part of his Pitch project but was forced to cancel plans.</p>

      <p>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra confirmed Prince Andrew is no longer its patron following the controversy around his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>In a statement, a spokesperson said: "Following HRH The Duke of York's announcement that he will be stepping back from public life, management representatives of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) met with Prince Andrew's office on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"At a subsequent meeting of the RPO Board, it was decided that the Orchestra should part company with its Patron, with immediate effect.</p>

      <p>"The RPO would like to express its gratitude to His Royal Highness for his support of the Orchestra over the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>"As one of the world's leading symphony orchestras, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra looks forward to an extensive UK and international concert schedule in the year ahead."</p>
      <p>A royal source earlier claimed Prince Andrew’s trusted aide Amanda Thirsk was shown the door after her catastrophic decision to allow the Duke of York to appear on Newsnight.</p>
      <p>Andrew was told loyal Ms Thirsk, who is on the board of Andrew’s Pitch@Palace project, would be sacked from her publicly funded role after he stepped down from public duties on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>However, royal sources claimed Andrew “vowed to keep her on his staff” and would use his own millionaire funds to pay her wages.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail said Ms Thirsk, believed to have been the driving force behind Andrew's catastrophic Newsnight interview, will now run the business mentorship scheme after she was dismissed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It's understood Ms Thirsk will also manage the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award.</p>
