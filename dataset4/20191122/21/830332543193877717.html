      <p>Marilyn was born August 22, 1948 in River Falls, Wisconsin the daughter of James and Jennie (Evans) Rogers. Marilyn's top priority was her family and she loved to share her adventurous spirit of the outdoors with them; including riding horses, kayaking, camping, and biking.   She only slowed down long enough to knit or read a book with a good cup of coffee. She had many common phrases including: "books are your friends", "you are the prettiest one up there", "well la di da", "love you pumpkin" and "shut the front door". Her grandchildren called her their best friend; she showed up to every sporting event they had to support not only them but also their teammates.  She will be deeply missed by her loving husband and family.    </p>
