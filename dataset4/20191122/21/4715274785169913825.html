      <p>Upon his election to a third term as Chairman of the PBA Board of Governors, Talk ‘N Text team governor Ricky Vargas expressed his appreciation to his fellow board members for electing him by acclamation Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I really did not expect to serve another term, I thought two successive was more than enough. But how could I say no when I was prevailed over by the Board members? This Board is a pleasure to work with and with them behind me, the challenge is made easier,” said Vargas.</p>
      <p>Asked for his vision for his new term, Vargas said he has a seven-point plan, namely: Strengthen the PBA presence in China. This year we launched our initial foray outside the Philippines and that market is huge. We must harness that potential; Ramp up our online presence which has been returning very encouraging numbers; Further cement our relationship with SBP for the Gilas program; Launch the PBA 3x3; Continue the PBA Outreach Programs to give back to the community; Enhance the PBA live viewer experience by continuing to innovate; and Improve the lot of PBA players by giving them opportunities through clinics on financial management, entrepreneurship, family relations and retirement preparation.</p>
      <p>Vargas said that these are doable initiatives as most of them are programs that have been started in Season 44. </p>
      <p>Vargas further said with the PBA Board and a hardworking grounded Commissioner working together Season 45 will be stronger and better.</p>
