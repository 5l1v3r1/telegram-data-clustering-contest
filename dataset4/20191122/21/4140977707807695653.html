            <b>NMG Vs DUR Dream11 : Table toppers Nelson Mandela Bay Giants look to further hammer down first place and stretch their lead at the top today.  </b>
          </p>
          <p>The only side in the ongoing edition of the showpiece Mzansi Super League to remain speckle free and unblemished, Nelson Mandela Bay Giants have been in flawless touch. The side are rightfully sitting atop of the league standings with the three wins and one truncated tie from four matches, a position which is a testament to their enter enigmatic, vibrant and radiant brand of cricket.</p>
          <p>Their pristine and exceptional form has exulted their ardent supporters in a bedlam, with the side stepping out into today’s clash against Durban Heat looking to emulate the same rousing showing. The side come into the wake of this clash having defeat Cape Town Blitz by five wickets as they chased down what should have been an extremely dicey 187 run target with relative ease.</p>

                <p>When Durban Heat take on a side of such calibre, the side who currently occupy a spot in fifth place will be well aware that they can’t afford to slip up at any stage if they are to rise from the agonising spot they occupy at the moment. The position they find themselves slumped in isn’t of their own making though with the side having to face the brunt of widespread rainfall, one which has resulted in their matches being cut short.</p>
                <p>With four of the five encounters the side were slated to pay in being marred and mauled by rain to be abandoned, the one defeat the side faced in their only encounter leaves them needing to start winning matches at the earliest. Their previous outing saw their pursuit of 142 set out by Tshwane Spartans being brought an end to at just 21 as rain decided to intervene and leave them infuriated once again.</p>

                            <h3>NMG Vs DUR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>The one wicket-keeper from either side comes into our Dream 11 side with us beginning with Dane Vilas from Durban Heat. The player is someone whose innate and precocious ability of coming out to clean the ball and send it crunching to the fence will see him fill his gloves with a slew of runs today.</p>
                            <p>From the other side of the department we have gone in with Heino Kuhn despite his relatively low batting slot given his ability to come out and capitalise on the death overs and bolster his side towards crucial runs in the culminating stages.</p>
                            <h3>NMG Vs DUR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Alex Hales has failed to emulate the same piquant displays which saw him being held in such reverence in the Vitality T20 Blast but he is someone we will continue to repose faith in. These are ideal conditions for him to fulfil the massive expectations his side accorded on his head to make the opener our choice for this clash from Durban Heat.</p>
                            <p>Wihan Lubbe comes in as well while from the other side of the docket we are beginning with Ben Dunk, someone who needed just 18 balls to score 28 runs the last time around as he continued in his free hitting ways to sky rocket his side to a hefty score. The 40 runs for Marco Marais saw him take his side past the finishing line without any hitters to see him come in from the outfit as well.</p>
                            <h3>NMG Vs DUR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>His 2 wickets with the ball were accompanied by the 19 quick runs with the bat as well to make Nelson Mandela Bay Giants’ Chris Morris the first name to be enshrined in our Dream 11 side of the day. From the other side we have gone in with Andile Phehlukwayo, someone who comes bearing a spot reminiscent to Morris with both the players holding key roles with both the bat for their sides.</p>
                            <h3>NMG Vs DUR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>With two wickets apiece in the side’s last outing, both Junior Dala and Imran Tahir will be galloping their way into our side from Nelson Mandela Bay Giants. The players come in not only due to the wickets they got but the periods of the match they came in as well with the two enticing and luring bats t go after them to embroiled them in a tiff.</p>
                            <p>Just the singular pick from the opposition meanwhile with Kyle Abbot wrapping up our side for this forthcoming outing.</p>
                            <h3>NMG Vs DUR Dream11 Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Dunk will be captaining our side while Morris come sin as the vice-captain.</p>
