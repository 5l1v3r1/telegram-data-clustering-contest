      <h1>Bronny James, Zaire Wade Shine In Debuts At Sierra Canyon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:05:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>LeBron James and Dwyane Wade certainly had their share of great moments together in the NBA, and on Thursday, the future Hall of Famers were able to watch their kids shine on the hardwood.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the former Miami Heat teammates announced that their sons would play high school basketball at Sierra Canyon.</p>
      <p>Sierra Canyon has such a star-studded roster that ESPN will televise 15 of its games. Thursday’s showdown against Montgomery High School was the first game that fans were able to watch on television.</p>
      <p>Bronny James and Zaire Wade only have one year together to build chemistry, since the latter is scheduled to graduate after this year. Nonetheless, they seem hell-bent on making the most of this season.</p>
      <p>Wade flashed his potential early as he finished off an alley-oop in style.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>James didn’t start for Sierra Canyon, but he did prove why he’s received interest from Duke, Kansas and Kentucky.</p>
      <p>During the second quarter, James connected on a three-pointer to mark the first points of his high school career. It’s fitting that his first basket came on an assist from Wade.</p>

      <p>James finished with 10 points in his debut, meanwhile Wade added six points.</p>
      <p>Sierra Canyon won 91-44 over Montgomery in large part because of its firepower on offense. In addition to having Bronny James and Zaire Wade, the Trailblazers have five-star guard BJ Boston.</p>
      <p>Were you impressed by how Sierra Canyon looked on Thursday?</p>
