      <p>Ade Adesomoju, Abuja</p>
      <p>The Federal High Court, in Abuja, will on November 29, rule on the bail application filed by Faisal Maina, son of the then former Chairman, Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina.</p>
      <p>Justice Okon Abang fixed the date for hearing after entertaining  arguments on the bail application on Friday.</p>
      <p>Faisal, represented by his lawyer, Francis Oronsaye, on Friday, is being prosecuted on three counts bordering on money laundering, to which the defendant had pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>The counsel prosecuting him on behalf of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mohammed Abubakar, opposed the bail application on Friday.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang had remanded Faisal’s father, Maina, who is also being prosecuted before the same court,  in Kuje Correctional Service centre.</p>
      <p>The judge had, however,  ordered the EFCC to keep Faisal in police custody at Police Tactical Squad, Asokoro, for investigation on allegation of possession of firearms and resistance to arrest.</p>
