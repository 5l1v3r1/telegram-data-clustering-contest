      <p>If you're looking for a Southern-twist on your Thanksgiving feast, look no further than the Turducken! Say what?! <br/><br/>A turducken is a chicken, inside of a duck, inside of a turkey and it's an explosion of Cajun flavors that the people at Hebert's Specialty Meats in Houston have been perfecting since 1984.<br/><br/>The creation, which can be difficult to make, is also a favorite of NFL Hall-of-Famer John Madden, and if you take just one bite, it might become your favorite, too!</p>
