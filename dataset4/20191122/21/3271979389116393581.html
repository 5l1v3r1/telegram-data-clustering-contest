      <p><b>Gwyneth Paltrow</b> never adopted a baby with her husband <b>Brad Falchuk</b>, but a tabloid reported one year ago today they’d be doing so. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the phony story when it was first published. Time has shown our reporting to be accurate.</p>
      <p>On November 22, 2018, <b><i>Star</i></b> claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/gwyneth-paltrow-adopting-baby-girl/">Paltrow and Falchuk were adopting a baby girl</a> in early 2019. The outlet quoted a so-called insider, who had no actual inside information, as saying, “They ended up agreeing it would be a magic blessing and decided to go full steam ahead. A baby will complete their blended family.” The couple, who between them have four children – two each from their previous marriages – never had plans to adopt a fifth.</p>
      <p>As evidence, <b>Gossip Cop</b> pointed out an interview Paltrow did with Howard Stern in which she clearly stated that she and Falchuk had no intention of having more children. She had told Stern in no uncertain terms, “Neither of us want more kids.” There was nothing ambiguous about her statement. We investigated further and after checking with two mutual friends and Paltrow’s spokesperson, we unequivocally busted the story.</p>
      <p>It’s been a year since then and almost 11 months have passed since early 2019, and Paltrow and Falchuk haven’t adopted a child. The tabloid’s story was completely bogus. The couple is still married, and they are still raising their four other children, but they have not added to their brood and they don’t plan to.</p>
      <p><i>Star</i> didn’t learn its lesson either. In January 2019, the outlet alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/chris-martin-gwyneth-paltrow-dakota-johnson-married-permission/">Paltrow’s ex-husband, Chris Martin, asked her permission to marry Dakota Johnson</a>. Paltrow and Falchuk had joined Martin and Johnson, who the Coldplay singer is dating, for New Year’s Eve, and the tabloid said Martin took the opportunity to ask his ex-wife’s permission to pop the question. Nothing about the outlet’s account of the trip was correct.</p>
      <p>Paltrow and Falchuk considered it their honeymoon, but included their kids and their exes on the getaway what Paltrow called a “very modern honeymoon.” There was no indication Martin was planning on asking Johnson to marry him, and he still hasn’t. <b>Gossip Cop</b> was once again correct in our reporting. The publication also failed to mention its previous adoption story, despite it being right around the time it said Paltrow would adopt. The outlet either forgot or simply ignored it’s own made-up article.</p>
      <p>In reality, <i>Star</i> has no insight into the couple’s relationship. In September 2018, just weeks before their wedding, the unreliable tabloid published an article claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/gwyneth-paltrow-dumped-brad-falchuk-split-wedding/">Falchuk had dumped Paltrow at the altar</a>. <b>Gossip Cop</b> immediately debunked the story, and the couple were married on September 29. There’s a pattern here: time isn’t on <i>Star</i>’s side.</p>
