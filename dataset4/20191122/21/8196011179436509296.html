      <p>Confidence amongst Irish SMEs has severely deteriorated in recent months with concerns over Brexit, business costs and economic forecasts battering already fragile sentiment.</p>
      <p>Latest quarterly findings from small and medium-sized business lobby group ISME shows that Irish SME business confidence plummeted 27% in the three months to the end of September. That compares to a modest rise of 1% in the second quarter of this year.</p>
      <p>Brexit confusion, insurance costs and general economic uncertainty rank highest amongst SME concerns, but only 1% are upbeat over their employment outlook for the next year, compared to 17% in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>ISME’s research shows that nearly half of SMEs expect to increase employee wages in the coming 12 months, while more than 60% have seen their motor insurance increase and around half have seen a rise in their public and employer liability insurance costs.</p>
      <p>“There are no real surprises in business sentiment this quarter. It has declined markedly. Given the general direction of Brexit — towards a UK outside the customs union — global economic uncertainty, and the complete stall in insurance reform, small businesses are battening down the hatches,” said ISME chief executive Neil McDonnell.</p>
      <p>SME lobby groups recently welcomed the Government’s plan for a new national SME and entrepreneurship strategy — based on less than flattering research findings around small Irish firms from the OECD — but stressed that a realistic timeline for implementation of key recommendations is vital.</p>
