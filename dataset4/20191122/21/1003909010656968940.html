      <p>Retired sheet metal worker Nick Acierno has bought and sold many properties in his lifetime. As a man who enjoys working with his hands, he’s renovated most of the homes he’s owned.</p>
      <p>But all that’s behind him now.</p>
      <p>He sold his last house in August — a property in northeast Calgary — in favour of a new place in Slokker Homes’ Canals Townhomes project in Airdrie. Finally, a home with no improvements to be made and no maintenance required.</p>
      <p>“It will be my first brand new home. All the other ones I’ve renovated, always doing my own work. This is great, I don’t have to do anything,” he says. “I’ll have the garage there and now that I’m not working, I can do the odd project to keep me busy when I get bored.”</p>
      <p>Nick is living with his son in Airdrie while his home, the Marcus A floorplan, is being built. His daughter-in-law, Melissa Acierno, sold him on the idea and literally sold him the home.</p>
      <p>“Melissa had just started working with Slokker over there about a year ago and said it was a fantastic opportunity, so I went to see them. I’d been looking around before that, thinking about moving to Airdrie, and I thought it was a good opportunity to get in right away,” he says.</p>
      <p>The Marcus A has 1,067 square feet developed plus a basement with a starting price of $239,900. There are two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and a detached garage. Slokker also has a two-bedroom Marcus B plan with 1,162 square feet with an attached garage and a porch. The Marcus C plan has 1,502 square feet, three-bedrooms and an attached garage, priced from $265,900.</p>
      <p>Slokker has two other models in Canals; the Heritage and Larchstone townhomes, starting at $269,000 and $315,00 respectively, both with larger square footage. The Marcus floor plans seem to be resonating with buyers in Airdrie with 20 of the first 24 homes already sold.</p>
      <p>“These are very popular with young families and empty nesters. The affordability of the three-bedroom option is the appeal for young families and our two-bedroom/two-master plans, each with a five-piece ensuite, are popular among downsizers,” says Melissa.</p>
      <p>Nick’s home renovation experience cultivated his appreciation for interior finishing. When it came to choosing colours and materials for his new home, there wasn’t much he wanted to change.</p>
      <p>“They had the cabinets I wanted, the flooring I wanted. It came with the quartz countertops that I like anyway, and all the stainless steel appliances. I was happy with it the way it was. It’s my style,” he says.</p>
      <p>Melissa says that buyers don’t often select many upgrades because Slokker homes are fully loaded with nine-foot ceilings, wood laminate flooring on the main level, soft-close doors and drawers.</p>
      <p>“Buyers are excited that the already low price includes all these high-end specifications,” she says.</p>
      <p>Nick is looking forward to tinkering in the basement or doing some woodwork in the garage when his home is finished. He feels some relief knowing that he can just take off and travel without worrying about whether the snow will be shovelled while he’s gone.</p>
      <p>The location in Genesis Land Development’s Canals district on the west side of Airdrie is another big bonus.</p>
      <p>“It’s right on the canals and the pathways. I can get up in the morning, go around for a walk — go to Tim Hortons down the way. It’s close to all my family, my grandchildren. I can come and go,” Nick says.</p>
