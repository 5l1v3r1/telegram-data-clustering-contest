        <i>NXT champion Adam Cole is in the midst of a grueling five-day stretch that will see him wrestle three times, including at NXT TakeOver: WarGames (Saturday, 7 p.m.) and then defend his title at Survivor Series (Sunday, 7 p.m.), both live on WWE Network. The leader of the Undisputed Era took some time from his busy schedule for some Q&amp;A with The Post’s Joseph Staszewski. The interview has been edited for brevity.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: How would you describe this challenging stretch that you are in the midst of, wrestling a ladder match on Wednesday, a WarGames match Saturday and then at Survivor Series Sunday?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: That’s tough. At the same time, there is so much adrenaline and excitement going through my body that I’m just ready for the challenge. This is exactly why I got into pro wrestling, to be put in situations like this, high-profile situations night after night. I’m going to make the absolute most of it. My body may not agree with me, but mentally I’m in a really good place and really excited.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Is there a way to keep your body ready as it’s going on?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: There are little things you can do. I know this sounds really silly to say, but this is going to be difficult for me, but trying to get as much sleep as I possibly can. I’m a big yoga guy, so I’m going to be doing a ton of yoga throughout the week, whether it’s before the show or in my hotel room when I get back. Any sort of stretching and moving around, keeping the blood flowing. And besides that, ibuprofen and some prayers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What do you have planned for Monday or Tuesday when it’s over?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It will be a combination of laying on my couch, playing a video game or two and then catching a movie or going to get some dinner with my girlfriend [AEW star Britt Baker]. A very, very low-key day.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: Were you disappointed to not be part of one of the brand crossover matches at Survivor Series?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Yes and no. Part of me, when you look at, especially this being the first ever Raw-SmackDown-NXT full-fledged show, of course that would be so cool to be apart of that [NXT] team. But then at the same time, every major championship, the WWE championship, the Universal championship, now the NXT championship, are being defended. So I wouldn’t change anything. I love that the NXT championship is being profiled, is being treated like an equally-as-important championship.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What do you think a Fiend-Brock Lesnar-Adam Cole match would have looked like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I was just talking about my tough schedule before. I could only imagine if I had to wrestle [them]. Those two guys are the biggest and baddest guys in all of WWE. I think part of making a legend out of myself, making a name for myself in WWE … I mean you never know, that match may happen, and I may have to prove that I can hang with those two beasts, those two giants. Fortunately for my body, it looks like I’ll be defending my NXT championship.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: How important is the weekend overall for NXT? The brand has had a huge spotlight on it, and this weekend is the culmination of that.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It’s the biggest weekend in NXT history, just to be standing there side by side with Raw, SmackDown. The fans are just so excited at all these possible dream matches and dream scenarios. I can feel the excitement in the building.</p>
      <p>For all these new people to get to see what NXT is all about is huge. Again, to me, this whole build leading to Survivor Series is the most important few weeks in NXT’s history.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: For NXT, what would that first ratings win over AEW mean?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: This might sound like a bummer, but the ratings don’t matter to me as much as they do to some people. It’s cool, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying at all that they don’t matter. It’s foolish. Of course ratings matter. But for me, just seeing the development of our show and putting on a show that I’m proud of and our team is proud of it is what I care about more.</p>
      <p>If the crowd is going absolutely insane, we’ve had this wild ride of a card, for two hours everyone has killer matches, we’ve got great storyline going on, everyone feels healthy afterwards — if we get beat a little bit in the ratings, that’s OK. If we win a little bit in the rating, that’s OK, too. [Editor: This Wednesday, NXT <a href="http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-20-2019.html">drew more total viewers</a> than AEW (916,000-893,000) for the first time.] It’s never been something that I’ve hyper-focused on. Maybe because I don’t like to obsess over something I can’t truly control. I’ll just feel like I’ll drive myself crazy if I obsess over that.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: When NXT invaded on Raw this Monday, you and Triple H had some chatter in the ring. Was there a reason for it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: The vibe that I got was Triple H has been pretty adamant about trying to have some guys come over to NXT, your Seth Rollins, your Kevin Owens. I pretty much in not-so-kind words told Triple H, “Listen, we don’t need ’em.” We don’t need anybody. Our roster right now is stacked. We don’t need a Kevin Owens. We don’t need a Seth Rollins. We don’t need a Daniel Bryan. As talented as those guys are, we don’t need anybody. NXT has gotten to where it’s gotten because of us, not because of those guys. I pretty much told Triple H, “Hey, chill out for a second, we are gonna beat this guy [Kevin Owens] up like we have everybody else on Raw and SmackDown.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Then how do you feel about Finn Balor joining NXT?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Really, when I look at it, with Finn coming back, I don’t blame Finn Balor. He looks at NXT and he sees how hot the brand is right now and almost has to completely reinvent himself. Again, guys like Kevin Owens, Rollins and Finn, these guys are forefathers of NXT. They helped build the brand of NXT for what it is today. So yeah, it created a lot of exciting matches. As long as he stays far away from my NXT championship, that’s all I care about.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Finn said on the “After the Bell” podcast that there is always a clamor for a Bullet Club reunion. His take was maybe it’s better we leave it and tease it than risk giving it to fans and it doesn’t live up to expectations. What’s your take on it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I kind of completely agree with him. Because when you look at everything the Bullet Club has done, to a lot of fans it was really, really cool, a lot of people’s favorite faction of the modern era. But so much of what we’re all doing now is so strong that to sacrifice that, for me to sacrifice the Undisputed Era, for AJ [Styles] to sacrifice the OC or Finn to stop doing what he’s doing for us to form this new Bullet Club reunion could be cool. But exactly like he said, it could be something maybe the fans expected something different, it couldn’t possibly live up to the expectations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Do you think there is room for more factions in WWE? There are great ones in their history, but it’s obviously not something we see a lot of now.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: When you have a team versus another team, like for example, UE versus the OC, there are just so many different matches. You could have a fresh feud with Undisputed Era-OC for easily six months and create all these new, different, exciting, cool scenarios and matches with so many different guys and different combinations and multi-mans. I love being in factions. It’s so cool to play off of somebody else. I’ve been in factions my whole career. I definitely think there’s room for more factions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What’s been the challenge of having you and Britt on two different schedules for two different companies [WWE and AEW]?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: That’s what it is, it’s the schedule. Lots of times, especially with me these past few weeks because I’ve been doing Raw, NXT and SmackDown, it’s even crazier because lots of times if it’s just Wednesday it’s not so bad because she’s gone as well.</p>
      <p>But with me and her, we’ve always made it work. When we first started dating, we actually were long -distance. It wasn’t super-far, but she was about three-and-a-half, four hours from me. We’d see each other once every couple weeks, so the advantage of us starting our relationship long-distance was now that we live together down in Florida, if I don’t see her for four and five days, it sucks, but we can do it because that’s how we started.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: She said you sneak in ways to watch her matches?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: All the time, for sure. She does the exact same thing. I watch her every single week, whether it’s after my show or, what have you, or even if it has to be the next day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Does it feel like you and Tommaso Ciampa are on an NXT championship crash course?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Since Tommaso’s comeback, it’s very obvious he’s made me his No. 1 target. I’m hoping after WarGames I can pass Tommaso and I don’t even have to deal with him challenging for the NXT championship because when we beat him this Saturday and pin him in the middle of the ring at WarGames, then we can move past this whole Tommaso deal.</p>
