      <h1>Sickle cell and priapism</h1>

      <p>I appreciate everyone who reached out to me from time to time through this medium. I also appreciate those who recommend me to other sickle cell warriors. Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr D Owoeye, who himself is a sickle cell warrior and I asked him to share an aspect of his life with us.  Enjoy the read:</p>
      <p>I have observed that few sickle cell warriors are comfortable to share their experiences of different sickle cell crises.  The stigmatisation and the frightening flashes those horrifying experiences bring are enough to discourage many sickle cell warriors from speaking about it. But sharing these experiences can help others understand qualitatively what sickle cell disease is about and can also help others, especially caregivers, learn how to provide quality care to sickle cell patients.</p>
      <p>One of those experiences of sickle cell crises that I want to share is PRIAPISM, and it all started in the humble city of Ilorin, Kwara State.</p>
      <p>Priapism, by definition, is a purposeless, persistent, progressive (prolonged) and painful penile (penis) erection which is not due to sexual arousal. It is often defined with the 4 Ps and commonly occurs in men from 30 years and above. There are two types of priapism: ischemic and non-ischemic. The symptoms felt are progressive pain, rigidness and erection of the penis. Other causes of priapism are leukemia, thalassemia, injuries (spinal cord injuries), multiple myeloma, metabolic disorders (amyloidosis), spider or scorpion bites, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and some drugs such as antidepressants, alpha blockers used for hypertension, antipsychotics, anxiolytics (drugs used for anxiety disorders), anticoagulants (heparin) etc. Priapism may lead to tissue damage causing erectile dysfunction when not treated promptly.</p>
      <p>Priapism is not related to sexual stimulation.  In sickle cell anemia, the sickled red blood cells can block the blood circulation to the penile shaft to cause a prolonged and painful erection. It is quite uncomfortable talking about it because it is about sharing the pain emanating from the private part of your private life; nevertheless, stories of the private can transform the public perception.</p>
      <p>I had my first encounter with priapism in medical school (500L or 5th year). It was horrible because the pain was like the vaso-occlusive pain – it makes you restless, fatigued and anxious.  It lasted for about five to 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>It was not acute urinary retention because my urinary bladder was not full though to urinate during such period is extremely unbearable and difficult.  The next day, I had to find out what happened, searching and reading about the complications of sickle cell anaemia from my medical books and lo and behold, I found it.  I read and digested all information I could find about priapism profusely and it perfectly described my encounter.  And from then, I had more experiences of it.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, it could be for 30 minutes to one hour, pacing up and down, massaging the base of the hardened and painful penile shaft, drinking as much water, using pain killers and as well prayer walking.</p>
      <p>I remember one of those ward rounds in medical school. I think it was during my obstetrics &amp; gynaecology or urology posting and the consultant tutoring my colleagues and me asked us to mention some of the causes of priapism; while my colleagues mentioned acute myeloid leukemia, injuries (of the penis, pelvis, perineum or spinal cord), amyloidosis, alcohol, drugs, and other causes, I mentioned sickle cell anaemia, not as a theoretical answer but an experiential answer.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to my internship days at the Nigerian Air Force hospital Ikeja, Lagos State, I had more episodes of it, lasting for about one to four hours and using piroxicam, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs. But (sometimes) progressing to pentazocine injection after all other remedies failed.</p>
      <p>Then the most horrific experience happened after my internship while I was working in a private hospital at Surulere, Lagos. I also had more episodes then but this one was the ‘baddest.’   It happened on a Sunday night (while all men slept), lasted for more than 24 hours, that was the longest and the last.  I couldn’t sleep throughout the night; early Monday morning, I called a doctor colleague to come and do a crude exchange transfusion. Using needle and syringe with the needle inserted into one of the veins in my penis shaft (the pain of priapism was worse than the pain of inserting the needle), he removed blood and injected equal volume of sterile water.</p>
      <p>We tried it for about 10 ml of equal volume and the pain reduced slightly while the erection was still unchanged.</p>
      <p>My colleague left for work at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and after about 30 minutes to one hour, the pain returned to its initial severity; it was such severe pain.</p>
      <p>It continued through the day and later, I had to call the medical director of a private hospital where I do alternate weekend calls to inform him that I would need an EBT (Exchange Blood Transfusion).</p>
      <p>It is the exchange of equal volume of the patient’s blood with another compatible blood.  I also informed my family about the need for the surgery. I was sure they all were shocked when they heard of priapism; growing as a sickle cell warrior with my parents and siblings, they experienced me having the pain crisis, but priapism was a whole new dimension for them.   I was admitted into the hospital, placed on intravenous fluid, the medical director discussed the surgery with me and my folks. He requested we try a particular therapy before the EBT and see if it would work.  I was given an intravenous infusion of an analgesic (either pentazocine or pethidine) and a slow intravenous injection of diazepam.</p>
      <p>After the diazepam was given, I slept like a baby (remember I haven’t slept since it started on Sunday night – I think I slept for a few minutes at midnight till the pain woke me up again) and later woke up with no priapism. That was how the EBT was avoided and the last time I had priapism. Thank God, I overcame. You  too will overcome.</p>
      <p>Some tips to prevent priapism in sickle cell warriors:  Regular and frequent intake of fluid; avoid every trigger of sickle cell crisis – dehydration, extremes of temperature, infections, stress (physical or mental) etc; use routine medications as requested: Folic acid, Hydroxyurea is one of the routine medications for sickle cell warriors as it induces the production of foetal haemoglobin in the bone marrows to reduce the production and concentration of sickled haemoglobin (HBSS).</p>
      <p>I appreciate Dr Owoeye for sharing his story because priapism only affects men and I know that this is a specific type of crisis that most men would not want to share.</p>
      <p>Disclaimer: it is not recommended that you try any of the above at home by yourself. It is always best practice for you to go to your medical doctor.</p>
