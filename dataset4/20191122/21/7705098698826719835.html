      <h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths Poster Heralds ‘the End of the Worlds’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:26:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>For almost six seasons, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-flash"><b>The Flash</b></a> has teased <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a>. Next month, the<b> Crisis</b> will finally arrive, and it’s going to take the entire Arrowverse to stop it.</p>
      <p>The CW has dropped the first poster for <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b>, which brings all of the major Arrowverse heroes together. Naturally, White Canary, The Flash, Supergirl, Green Arrow, and Batwoman are all prominently featured as the leading heroes of their respective shows. However, Black Lightning is also given a space next to the primary characters. This will mark Black Lightning’s Arrowverse debut.</p>
      <p>To the left of Black Lightning, Iris West-Allen, Vibe, and the Flash of Earth-90 are present. Above them, <b>Legends of Tomorrow</b>‘s John Constantine stands with Lois Lane and Superman. On the right side, Lyla Diggle/Harbinger stands alongside Kingdom Come Superman, Lex Luthor, and Martian Manhunter. The Monitor lurks behind them all as he holds the fate of the worlds in his hands.</p>
