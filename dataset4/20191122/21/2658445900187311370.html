      <p>Yahoo Co-founder Jerry Yang on Friday said the world was at risk of losing some of the technological progress made in recent decades.</p>
      <p>According to him, this can be due to the trade tensions and growing tech divide between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>Yang warned of “unintended consequences’’ that can occur when Washington and Beijing back away from the collaborative nature of their relationship from the past three decades.</p>
      <p>“I think the core of innovation is being very severely challenged by the current trend,’’ Yang said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing.</p>
      <p>“We’re in danger of going back to the dark age if we do not standardise, if we do fracture into little pockets of markets that really don’t sustain themselves,’’ Yang said.</p>
      <p>Yang Yuanqing, chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo, said the idea of a technological “decoupling’’ between the U.S and China was unrealistic.</p>
      <p>Different technological standards would create discomfort for consumers, Yang Yuanqing said.</p>

      <p>“Every time you go to a different country, you’ll have to change your cellphone,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>The concept of a technological “decoupling’’ between the East and West has gained prominence in recent months after Washington heavily restricted Chinese tech giant Huawei from buying U.S components and software.</p>
      <p>No country can single-handedly build the infrastructure necessary for an economy that heavily relies on data, said Gary Dickerson, president and chief executive officer of U.S. semiconductor maker Applied Materials.</p>
      <p>“The companies and the countries that will grow the fastest are the ones that collaborate best.</p>
      <p>“Those are the companies that will win the future,’’ Dickerson said.</p>
