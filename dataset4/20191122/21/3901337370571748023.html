      <p>Hazard arrived at Los Blancos at the beginning of the season for a reported fee of €100 million (R1.6 billion) from Chelsea, but was widely criticised during the early parts of the campaign due to his indifferent form.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international has since admitted that he struggled in Spain initially, but also revealed that Zidane helped keep him motivated during his early days at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>"The first two or three months at Real Madrid were not as I wanted them to be," Hazard said, according to <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"Zinedine Zidane told me to remain calm. 'Be happy,' he repeated to me.</p>
      <p>"He goes straight to the point, he loves his players. You feel that the team is happy for him being the coach."</p>

      <p>Much of Hazard's troubles were attributed to the fact that he arrived at the club overweight, but the former Chelsea star has defended his fitness and physique.</p>
      <p>"It is true, when I am on vacation, I am on vacation. Otherwise, I never have a vacation," the 28-year-old added.</p>
      <p>"When I was 18 years old at Lille, I weighed 72 or 73kg. Then, when I increased muscle mass, I reached 75kg.</p>
      <p>"This summer I weighed 80kg, but I lost everything in 10 days."</p>
