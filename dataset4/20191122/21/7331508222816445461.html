      <h1>Dana White: Jon Jones to defend title vs. Dominick Reyes on Feb. 8</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:20:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Brett Okamoto</a></address>
      <p>UFC light heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335639/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> will defend his title against <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4233039/dominick-reyes">Dominick Reyes</a> on Feb. 8 in Houston, UFC president Dana White told ESPN.</p>
      <p>The 205-pound championship fight will headline the UFC's pay-per-view event, which does not yet have an official number, inside Toyota Center. In the co-main event, women's flyweight champion <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2554705/valentina-shevchenko">Valentina Shevchenko</a> (18-3) will face No. 1 contender <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4026490/katlyn-chookagian">Katlyn Chookagian</a> (13-2).</p>
      <p>For Jones (25-1), it will mark his 15th appearance in a UFC title fight. Widely considered the greatest fighter of all time, Jones defended his title twice in 2019, via decision victories over <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3045798/thiago-santos">Thiago Santos</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2512976/anthony-smith">Anthony Smith</a>. The only loss of Jones' storied career came via disqualification in 2009, meaning he has never legitimately been defeated in competition.</p>
      <p>Jones, who fights out of JacksonWink MMA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, announced earlier this month on social media that he intended to face Reyes, stating "[I'm] beating his ass next."</p>
      <p>Reyes (12-0) is an undefeated contender out of Southern California. He has earned a title shot by compiling a 6-0 record in the UFC, including a first-round knockout over former middleweight champion <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2553993/chris-weidman">Chris Weidman</a> in October.</p>
      <p>Reyes, 29, has been fighting professionally since 2014. He has recorded finishes in nine of his 12 wins, including seven knockouts.</p>
      <p>The Feb. 8 pay-per-view does not have a number because the UFC has not officially announced its schedule for the first quarter in 2020. The promotion is considering adding a pay-per-view event in January.</p>
