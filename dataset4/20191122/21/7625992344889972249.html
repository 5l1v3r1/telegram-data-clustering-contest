      <h1>White Alabama officer convicted of manslaughter in death of unarmed black man</h1>

      <p>A jury in Ozark, Alabama, on Friday found a white officer guilty of manslaughter in the 2016 shooting of Greg Gunn, an unarmed black man, a <a href="https://www.alabamanews.net/2019/11/22/breaking-aaron-smith-guilty-of-the-manslaughter-of-greg-gunn/">CBS affiliate in Montgomery reported</a>. District Attorney Darryl Bailey said the state will ask for the maximum sentence, according to the station.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors had charged Aaron Cody Smith with murder, but jurors returned the unanimous verdict on the charge of manslaughter, The Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>Smith shot Gunn, 58, when he was walking home late at night in Montgomery, Alabama. Smith stopped Gunn for a stop-and-frisk, according to the AP. During the stop, Gunn allegedly fled from Smith, and the defense said Gunn grabbed a painter's poll from a nearby porch. Prosecutors argued that Gunn was never a threat, the AP reported.</p>
      <p>The defense cited Alabama's Stand Your Ground Law, the first time the law has been used by an officer in the state.</p>
      <p>The trial was repeatedly delayed as eight successive judges recused themselves from the case, according to The New York Times.</p>
