      <p>When 9-year-old Kamryn Henderson gets the blues, he writes music about it.</p>
      <p>But the third-grader started getting bullied at school and online — so much so that he had to enroll in a new school. It became nearly impossible to sing away his troubles.</p>
      <p>“If I cried, then I would get bullied more,” he <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/boy-9-writes-song-after-being-bullied-at-school/29877258">told KMBC News</a> in Blue Springs, Mo.</p>
      <p>When one student called him “trash,” he reached a tipping point.</p>
      <p>“I looked at my phone again and I’m like, ‘I’m not trash,’ ” said the young musician. “That’s not true. That’s not true at all.”</p>
      <p>To cope with the painful experience, he wrote a song called “Look Within Yourself.” He then filmed himself singing and playing the song on his ukulele, and bravely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfKWELgU6r0">shared the video</a> on social media this week.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes bullies will tell you that you’re not good enough or you have to change who you are,” he wrote on YouTube. “Be you. Don’t worry about the other stuff.”</p>
      <p>Kamryn, who hopes to make it to Broadway one day, said writing the song made him feel “better about himself” and added that the tune is dedicated to all bullied kids out there, especially his sister, who he said is also teased at school.</p>
      <p>“You’re beautiful and special if no one ever tells you,” he sings. “You don’t have to change a thing for someone else. Just look within yourself. Just look within yourself.”</p>
      <p>His mother, Chloe Cooper, is proud of her son’s resilience in the face of his tormentors.</p>
      <p>“When you listen to the song, you can hear that confidence. You can hear that he’s happy with who he is,” she said. “He’s kind of saying to the world, ‘This is me.’ ”</p>
      <p>His song is one of the more heartwarming ways kids are tackling the issue of bullying. At the start of the school year, a Kansas second-grader was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/27/boy-holds-hand-of-crying-classmate-with-autism-on-first-day-of-school/">photographed consoling an autistic classmate</a> who was being teased.</p>
