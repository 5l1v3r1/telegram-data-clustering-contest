      <h1>Lease-back programs sweeten the experience of buying the show home</h1>

      <p>The Twilight show home, built by Truman Homes in Carrington South, is a brilliantly designed masterpiece.</p>
      <p>That’s why Philip Wu, a Calgary production analyst, and his wife, accountant Lingyun Zou, had to have that exact house. So, they bought it, even though it will continue operating as a show home until at least August 2020. Truman is now their tenant.</p>
      <p>“We purchased this home through Truman’s lease-back program. My wife just loves it and we’re all antsy about moving in, but this is a great way to get some value back,” Wu says.</p>
      <p>The couple and their young daughter will continue to live in nearby in Panorama Hills until Truman has finished with their new home. Wu and Zou have been in their current home — their first home — for five or six years. Several months ago, they started looking around in the northwest, where Wu grew up, armed with a list of what they really wanted in their next home.</p>
      <p>Zou found the Twilight online and after a visit to the show home, it was game over. It had everything they wanted — with one exception.</p>
      <p>“I would have liked a triple-car garage, but hey, it’s a show home,” Wu says, smiling.</p>
      <p>The 2,511-square-foot Twilight is a two-storey front garage home with a large great room, open plan kitchen with an oversized island, three bedrooms and a unique upstairs bonus room. The basement is undeveloped, but Wu says in time, they’ll finish it to accommodate annual visits from his in-laws.</p>
      <p>He says that while they were arranging financing for their home, a steady stream of friends went through the Twilight to see what the fuss was all about.</p>
      <p>“It was weird — our friends all going to see it. I’m glad we got it while we could — it’s attracted a lot of attention,” says Wu, who admits they go to visit “their” home whenever they can.</p>
      <p>The base price of the Twilight is $590,900, but the show home with all its upgrades and its West Coast Modern exterior came in at $729,900.</p>
      <p>Truman is paying the couple’s mortgage payments while the show home is operational, plus an additional six per cent every month. The leaseback program is not exclusive to Truman as many Calgary builders, eager to get homes sold, will entertain offers.</p>
      <p>Jayman Built also covers a buyer’s mortgage payments during a lease with a 6.5 per cent return. The builder also covers property maintenance and utilities.</p>
      <p>Jayman president and COO Dave Desormeaux says leaseback programs have been around for many years and generally run about 18 months.</p>
      <p>“The program allows us to recapture the capital currently invested in our show homes, which can then be re-invested into new ones. The leaseback rates increase or decrease depending on the market and show home inventory,” he says. “We believe this is a great time for investors or customers to take advantage of this program. The rates have never been better and we believe new home prices cannot go much lower.”</p>
      <p>Wu says they could have built the Twilight in their preferred neighbourhood of Carrington South, an Apex Land community, and replicated everything they saw in the show home, with less waiting time. But Truman didn’t have a similar lot available.</p>
      <p>“We liked the lot location and the direction it faces. It’s a walkout on a conventional lot that backs onto a green space and pathway with a small pond,” he says. “We have somewhere to live now — we don’t need to move right away. It was a pretty good deal and there was nothing else we wanted. We thought, let’s get it, in case we miss the opportunity.”</p>
      <p>Truman area sales manager Dipali Damji says that everyone loves how open and spacious the Twilight is.</p>
      <p>“Due to its popularity, we have recently added a new plan to our offering — the Twilight II. It’s a slightly smaller version at 2,325 square feet,” she says.</p>
      <p>Damji says Truman has a quick possession home on Carringsby Landing with 2,543 square feet, four bedrooms, three bathrooms and many features of the show home like a custom tiled shower and luxury spa bathroom, available immediately.</p>
      <p>“In time for Christmas,” she says.</p>
