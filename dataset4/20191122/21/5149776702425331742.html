      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited staff and patients at a Nottinghamshire hospital before facing off against other party leaders in a TV Question Time.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson visited the Bassetlaw District General <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">Hospital</a> in Worksop, where he met staff and patients alongside health secretary Matt Hancock on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>It is the third visit the Primer Minister has made to Nottinghamshire since the General Election was called.</p>
      <p>On November 16 he was in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/we-thought-nuisance-caller-boris-3545978">Mansfield speaking to residents about the upcoming election</a> and on November 8 the Prime Minister paid a visit to Queen's Medical Centre and the Nottinghamshire Live offices where he was asked about the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/prime-minister-boris-johnson-wants-3517327">city's hospitals</a>, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/homelessness-scourge-society-says-boris-3517640">homelessness</a>, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/boris-johnson-hesitant-scrapping-incredibly-3517195">HS2</a> and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nottingham-city-council-spending-money-3518194">Robin Hood Energy.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking at Bassetlaw District General Hospital about the Conservative proposal to charge foreign buyers more stamp duty, Mr Johnson said: "What we're doing is putting a 3 percent increase in stamp duty for foreign buyers.</p>

      <p>"Now, one of the advantages of getting Brexit done is that you can then do it in a non-discriminatory way between all international buyers - because previously you couldn't do it with people coming from the 27 other EU countries.</p>
      <p>"As we come out of the EU we'll be able to levy that increased stamp duty on all international buyers.</p>
      <p>"I want our market to be open - I want people to be able to buy stuff in the UK - but it is only reasonable when international buyers come in and buy property that they should make a contribution to life in this country.</p>

      <p>"And we will use that 3 percent stamp duty to help tackle the problems of homelessness. I think it is the right thing to do."</p>
      <p>On Friday evening, the leaders of the main political parties faced a tough grilling from a BBC Question Time audience.</p>
      <p>Each <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">party leader</a> had 30 minutes to answer questions from an audience selected to represent the political make-up of the UK.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson for the Conservatives, Jeremy Corbyn for Labour, Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP and Jo Swinson for the Liberal Democrats took part.</p>
