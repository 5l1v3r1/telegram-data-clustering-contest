      <p>Winter is rolling in fast and it may cause some issues on mountain passes and on city roads below.</p>
      <p>Environment Canada issued a special weather statement travellers may want to take note of for tonight, Nov. 22, and tomorrow. There may be freezing rain on the Coquihalla Highway, from Hope to Merritt and Kamloops, and the Okanagan Connector, from Merritt to Kelowna.</p>
      <p>The warning also extends to the South and North Thompson, Similkameen, Vernon, Kelowna, the Shuswap and Boundary.</p>
      <p>“An approaching frontal system will track across the southern BC interior tonight and Saturday,” reads the alert.</p>
      <p>“Flurries are expected tonight and Saturday morning. The warm air aloft combined with near or below zero temperatures at the surface will result in a risk of freezing rain. The flurries with the risk of freezing rain will change to rain showers Saturday afternoon as temperatures rise above zero.”</p>
      <p>Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Take extra caution when walking or driving in affected areas.</p>
      <p>Continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.</p>
