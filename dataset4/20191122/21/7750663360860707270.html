      <p>The Staggies are without a win in seven games, although four draws have helped them to sixth place in the Ladbrokes Premiership table.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the visit to bottom side St Mirren, the 25-year-old County captain told the Highland club's official YouTube channel that the players are in good shape as the domestic season resumes.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's been good. The weather has been a bit cold so we have been inside.</p>
      <p>"The sessions have been short and sharp and we have had plenty of small games in to the legs so the boys have enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"The run of results isn't the best we have had so we just know we can do better.</p>
      <p>"But there is a group of determined boys in there who know that, they are honest with themselves so everyone knows they can do better.</p>
      <p>"You can see that in training sessions and hopefully we can take that into the game."</p>
      <p>Fraser scored a last-gasp winner when St Mirren visited Dingwall in September.</p>
      <p>However, this time the former Celtic player is simply hoping to get the three points against the Buddies.</p>
      <p>He said: "Obviously it is good to chip in with goals, especially in the last minute to get three points. That was brilliant.</p>
      <p>"But to be honest I don't care who gets on the scoresheet as long as we hopefully win on the day. If we can do that it will be a great three points.</p>
      <p>"Every game against teams around you in the league is so important.</p>
      <p>"We know that going down there is going to be a tough test. But we know that we want the three points and if we turn up and play well then I think that is possible."</p>
