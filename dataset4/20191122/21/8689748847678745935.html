      <p>Kelvyn Brown, known popularly as Kelvyn Boy has finally reacted to claims that Blakk Cedi signed him secretly when he was still with Stonebwoy’s Bhim Nation.</p>
      <p>During the fracas which erupted in the camp of Burniton Music Group (BMG) which saw Kelvyn Boy being axed from the record label, it also emerged that Stonebwoy’s former manager Blakk Cedi signed Kelvyn Boy to his Black Arm record label without Stonebwoy’s knowledge.</p>
      <p>The Mea crooner has refuted the hearsay, explaining to Sammy Flex on Zylofon FM earlier today that he is not signed to Black Arm or any other label as at the moment.</p>
      <p>“For now, I am not signed to any record label. Just that my brother Didi and Blakk Cedi are around, giving me advice and guiding me. If not, things would have gotten worse”</p>
      <p>“I was never signed (to Black arm)” he added.</p>
