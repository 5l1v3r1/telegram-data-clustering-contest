      <h1>Nick Bosa Reveals What Larry Fitzgerald Told Him After Block</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:57:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Lost in last weekend’s victory for the <a href="https://thespun.com/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> was Arizona Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald nearly knocking defensive end Nick Bosa out of cleats with an aggressive block. While the block from the future Hall of Famer was quite incredible, his reaction after it was even better.</p>
      <p>Bosa is having a nice rookie season for the 49ers. In fact, the Ohio State product is on the verge of winning the Defensive Rookie of the Year.</p>
      <p>Through 10 games, Bosa has 32 tackles, seven sacks and an interception.</p>
      <p>Not many players this year have stopped the talented defensive end, but Fitzgerald did what he needed to do in order to prevent Bosa from getting after Kyler Murray.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Bosa revealed that Fitzgerald actually apologized for the vicious block.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, man, I’ve got to slow you down somehow,” Fitzgerald told Bosa.</p>
      <p>Here’s a video of the block from Fitzgerald:</p>

      <p>In reality this wasn’t a cheap shot from Fitzgerald. He didn’t hit Bosa in his knees nor make contact to his head.</p>
      <p>Fans won’t get to watch Nick Bosa and Larry Fitzgerald battle again this season, but it’s pretty cool to see the mutual respect between the rookie and veteran.</p>
      <p>Arizona is currently enjoying its bye week, whereas San Francisco is preparing for a Sunday night showdown against Green Bay.</p>
