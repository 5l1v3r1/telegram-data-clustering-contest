      <p>Along with her guest appearance on Davido’s latest studio album <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/davido-a-good-time-new-album-stream"><i>A Good Time</i></a>, Summer Walker is linking up with Chris Brown and London On Da Track for a new single titled “Something Real.” Notably, “Something Real” comes to us directly following London On Da Track’s announcement concerning a forthcoming acoustic album from Summer Walker, so look at this record as a potential preview of what’s to come from the pair.</p>
      <p>“You’ve gotta be vulnerable when it comes to writing songs, ’cause you don’t know who else might be going through the same stuff, and it might help them out,” Summer Walker shared with <a href="https://www.clashmusic.com/features/shunning-the-spotlight-summer-walker-interviewed"><i>Clash</i></a>, opening up about her creative and songwriting process for a rare interview. “Some artists go to the studio often and just write, write, write. I only go to the studio like twice a month or something. I tend to only really write something if it’s heavy on my heart … Usually I really like to be at home in my own space to record, so I’ll write something and then send it over for everyone else to do in their own place.”</p>
      <p>“Anybody that he works with he pays attention to what they need, that’s why he’s where he is today. He’s really talented,” Walker added, speaking to <i>Clash</i> about her “Something Real” collaborator — and significant other — London On Da Track.</p>
