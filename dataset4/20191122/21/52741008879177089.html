      <p>TORONTO — Some of the most active companies traded Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Toronto Stock Exchange (16,954.84, down 44.35 points.)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aurora Cannabis Inc. (TSX:ACB). Health care. Down 56 cents, or 13.53 per cent, to $3.58 on 20.3 million shares.</p>
      <p>The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings. (TSX:TGOD). Health care. Down 22 cents, or 18.8 per cent, to 95 cents on 13.3 million shares.</p>
      <p>Manulife Financial Corp. (TSX:MFC). Financials. Up two cents, or 0.08 per cent, to $25.80 on 11 million shares.</p>
      <p>Husky Energy Inc. (TSX:HSE). Energy. Down 18 cents, or 1.84 per cent, to $9.60 on 9.5 million shares.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Companies in the news:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canada Jetlines Ltd. (TSX-V:JET). Up half a cent or 11.1 per cent to five cents. Canada Jetlines Ltd. says it is suing WestJet Airlines co-founder David Neeleman in the United States for allegedly interfering in the fledgling discount carrier's efforts to get off the ground. Executive chairman Mark Morabito said it launched legal proceedings in the U.S. district court in Connecticut against Neeleman, DGN Corp. and Breeze Aviation Group, for "tortious interference with business expectancy and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act." In a statement of claim, it alleges Neeleman and his affiliates embarked on "a predatory scheme" to destroy the relationship between Jetlines and an international investment bank that ultimately terminated its help in raising new capital to start the airline.</p>
      <p>Canadian National Railway Co. (TSX:CNR). Up 25 cents to $120.20. The federal government urged Canadian National Railway Co. and its striking workers to continue talks in what it believes would be the fastest way to resolve their dispute which has stopped freight trains across the country. The strike at the country's biggest railway entered its fourth day with no resolution in sight as round-the-clock negotiations continue under the watch of federal mediators. The Teamsters union said Friday that "no substantive progress has been made" since 3,200 workers hit the picket lines early Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>MEG Energy Corp. (TSX:MEG). Down three cents to $5.60. Shares in oilsands producer MEG Energy Corp. rose by as much as 3.9 per cent Friday after it announced lower capital spending and a continued focus on debt retirement in 2020. Analysts applauded the Calgary-based company's plan to spend $250 million next year — about $20 million less than some expected — with production that is still forecast to meet expectations at between 94,000 and 97,000 barrels of bitumen per day. MEG says about $210 million of the budget is considered sustaining and maintenance capital.</p>
