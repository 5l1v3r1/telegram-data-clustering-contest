      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> greeted athletes during NCAA Collegiate National Champions Day at the White House on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trump briefly mentioned the economy, China and the impeachment inquiry and posed for photographs with champions in nonrevenue sports who gathered in various rooms in the White House.</p>
      <p>"We're having a great year," <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-ncaa-collegiate-national-champions-day/">Trump said</a>. "This has been an amazing year for our economy. And meeting these athletes -- they're real athletes, I can tell you. It's a tremendous achievement."</p>
      <p>Ahead of Friday's meeting, some members of the Columbia University fencing team prepared a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/columbia-fencing-s-letter-to-president-trump/70da61a3-d85c-446d-b031-9e469ddf85e5/">letter to Trump</a>, criticizing the president for efforts related to Title IX protections, reproductive health and sexual assault.</p>
      <p>"[W]hile ours is a victory born from values of gender equality, yours is one shadowed by continued acts of gender-based prejudice and partisanship," the letter reads.</p>
      <p>Some members of the team declined to attend the event, citing the example of professional athletes, including <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/US_Women/?tps=1">U.S. Women's National Soccer Team</a> star Megan Rapinoe and NBA star <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Stephen_Curry/?tps=1">Stephen Curry</a>.</p>
      <p>Others chose to to raise issues of concern, wearing white buttons in "solidarity with those impacted by gender-based discrimination."</p>
