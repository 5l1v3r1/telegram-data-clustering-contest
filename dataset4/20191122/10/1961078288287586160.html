      <h1>Beck Is Captivated by American Myths and a $60 Guitar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:00:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lindsay Zoladz</a></address>
      <p>“I’m drawn to things that feel like they were made at the wrong time,” said the stylistically restless musician Beck, recalling a formative trip to Madrid’s Prado museum while on tour early in his career. It was his first encounter with Hieronymus Bosch — who painted like a contemporary of Salvador Dalí even though he began work on his wild masterpiece “The Garden of Earthly Delights” way back in 1490. (“I’ve always intended to try and write an album based on that painting,” Beck, 49, said. “I’m not sure how that would work.”)</p>
      <p>That outside-of-time quality binds together many of his favorite things, from Rimbaud’s “Illuminations” to a blessedly unrenovated New Orleans music hall. It’s always present in his music, too: His 14th studio album, “Hyperspace,” out Friday, crosses vintage Pink Floyd reveries with futuristic-minded coproduction from Pharrell Williams. Beck called from his Los Angeles home to expound on the 10 things he can’t live without. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.</p>
      <p><b>1. </b><b><a href="https://www.silvertoneworld.net/electric/1448/1448.html">Silvertone 1448 Guitar</a></b><b> </b>“It’s a cheap guitar from the Sears catalog, basically made out of particle board. It’s not considered remotely in the pantheon of great instruments; it’s sort of looked down upon by real musicians. I think I bought it for about $60. Now I have dozens of incredible, classic guitars, but I keep going back to this one that’s supposedly not so good. It barely stays in tune. But it just has this sort of rickety sound — beautifully hellacious, but also a little broken and tender. I’ve recorded so many of my albums with it. I’ve been playing it my entire career.”</p>
      <p><b>2. </b><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/books/books-of-the-times-how-elvis-became-elvis-a-legend-s-early-years.html?module=inline">“Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley”</a></b><b><i> </i></b><b>by Peter Guralnick </b>“I tell musicians to read it because it’s such a fascinating, almost forensic account of the early years of Elvis. It does a fantastic job of humanizing him and taking you through a day-to-day view of his life and how an all-American but highly unusual story of an artist comes together and collides with pop culture. It has an almost biblical quality to it. It just feels like American myth.”</p>
      <p><b>3. </b><b><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059229/">Federico Fellini’s “Juliet of the Spirits”</a></b><b> </b>“As a young child, I was not left with a babysitter; I got taken to the movies. There were a lot of repertory theaters that just played old films, and we’d go a lot. A lot of them were subtitled and fairly adult, but for whatever reason I just adapted to them from a young age. They weren’t necessarily entertainment as I would understand it. This was not ‘Cannonball Run’ or ‘Gremlins.' I remember seeing ‘Juliet of the Spirits’ when I was 14 or 15, and it just represented a world that I wanted to go be a part of. It’s indefinable. I’m glad it exists.”</p>
      <p><b>4. </b><b><a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3906.html">The Philosopher’s Path</a></b><b>; Kyoto, Japan </b>“Whenever I’m in Japan, I have to go there and do a walk. It’s near the Silver Temple, at the top of this steep street full of shops, and there’s a stream, or a little river, surrounded by cherry blossom trees. When some of the blossoms are in bloom they’re just raining down like pink confetti, going into the water, floating down the stream. I always get a great surge of happiness when I go there. I got to work with David Bowie once, and he traveled a lot to Kyoto. We had a conversation about that place. However you want to put it, there’s an energy there, a presence.”</p>
      <p><b>5. </b><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/book-review-illuminations-by-arthur-rimbaud.html?module=inline">“Illuminations”</a></b><b> by Arthur Rimbaud </b>“That was a big book for me as a kid. I know it’s a <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/patti-smith-buys-reconstructed-home-frances-most-beloved-poets">big book for Patti Smith</a> — he’s sort of a patron saint for her, and I think for myself, too. It’s a very mysterious book. Sort of a Bible from another universe, and written by a teenager. I feel like a lot of things that I love have some sort of trace or root back to that book. It was never celebrated in his lifetime, and it’s this manual of unfiltered artistic impulse that doesn’t fit in with its time. It’s that sort of creativity where you’re not writing it to seem relevant, but almost as something for the future.”</p>
      <p><b>6. </b><b><a href="https://www.preservationhall.com/">Preservation Hall</a></b><b>, New Orleans </b>“It’s this little tiny room with a courtyard behind it, and every night there’s some kind of music going on — traditional Dixieland, local bands, cabaret. It’s got so much history coming out of the walls. You don’t really see that often in America. It’s a miracle that it still exists and that nobody’s tampered with it or tried to update it or commercialize it or something.”</p>
      <p><b>7. </b><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/movies/ingmar-bergman-criterion-box-set.html?module=inline">“Ingmar Bergman’s Cinema” Boxed Set</a></b><b> </b>“I had this one year where I decided to watch all his films. For me it was this incredible education on the process of evolving as an artist. You would go through three or four films that were interesting, but not really definitive. Sometimes there were misfires, curiosities, experiments — and then, an absolute masterpiece would emerge. It’s sort of like Bob Dylan or Picasso, one of those great artists where there are the masterpieces and there’s all this interstitial work, but you go through it and you get a sense of what it takes to be an artist that goes deep into the heart of things. I walked away thinking that he was the Shakespeare of film. Somebody that just really encompasses the whole human experience.”</p>
      <p><b>8. </b><b><a href="https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/">McNally Jackson</a></b><b> Bookstore, New York </b>“I don’t really have a church, but if I had a church it would probably be a bookstore. It’s small, but it’s so well-curated that you want to read everything in there. To me it represents that kind of independent bookstore that I grew up with, that I would just waste away hours in.”</p>
      <p><b>9. </b><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/05/arts/design/hieronymus-bosch-hell.html?module=inline">Hieronymus Bosch</a></b><b>’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” </b>“I was really drawn to at a young age when I first saw it in my early 20s, at the Prado in Madrid, when I was on tour. The technique of it is just incredible. Part of me was marveling at how this thing survived. And how did somebody make something so crazy and get away with it, at a time when there were so much censorship and intolerance? And what about all the works we’ll never know about, that were even crazier than this one?”</p>
      <p><b>10. Harry Smith’s </b><b><a href="https://folkways.si.edu/anthology-of-american-folk-music/african-american-music-blues-old-time/music/album/smithsonian">“Anthology of American Folk Music”</a></b><b> </b>“I read about it for years. It was mentioned in books over and over as a big influence on a lot of the ’60s generation; I think Dylan got a hold of it early and learned every song on it. A lot of the themes of his great work are in that collection. I finally got a copy of it in my early 20s, on cassette. Music comes and goes, but it’s sort of this bedrock. It’s a mixture of blues and country that contains the musical DNA of our American identity. And it’s coming at the dawn of recording, so it’s this document of our musical identity before it becomes commercialized and self-conscious. It’s highly original and eccentric. It’s the most American thing.”</p>
