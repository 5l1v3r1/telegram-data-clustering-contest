      <p>Numerous witnesses at the House impeachment hearings have testified that President Trump was refusing to grant a crucial meeting and unfreeze U.S. military aid to Ukraine until its new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announced investigations into Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and the gas company Burisma, on whose board Hunter Biden sat. Zelensky <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879122/cnns-fareed-zakaria-gives-backstory-fateful-scrapped-interview-ukraines-president">almost complied</a>, but Trump released the money <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877007/ukraine-aid-reportedly-released-just-2-days-before-zelensky-set-announce-burisma-investigation">two days before</a> the announcement.</p>
      <p>On Thursday's <i>Late Show</i>, Stephen Colbert informed guest Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) that what Zelensky wouldn't do, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) will undertake instead. "There is news that just broke," he said, "that Lindsey Graham is <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/880308/lindsey-graham-seems-gearing-impeachment-trial">launching a probe</a> of the Bidens, Burma, and Ukraine. First question: What the hell?" He noted that Harris is on the Senate Judiciary Committee with Graham. "What do you make of this?" he asked.</p>
      <p>"It's the same thing that they've been doing, which is to create a big distraction from the facts and the evidence," Harris said. "The Burisma, the Biden probe — it's a bunch of B.S." Colbert pointed out that even Republican impeachment witnesses like Kurt Volker said there's nothing there and you can't impugn Biden's character with this. Harris said Graham's investigation shows Republicans "know they have to create this big distraction" to keep America from focusing on "the fact that we have a criminal living in the White House."</p>

      <p>Graham was, not too long ago, in agreement about Biden's character and rectitude, especially when it comes to his family.</p>

      <p>Harris said she's skeptical her GOP colleagues will vote to convict Trump in the Senate, and explained why she wants Vice President Mike Pence to testify. Watch below. Peter Weber</p>
