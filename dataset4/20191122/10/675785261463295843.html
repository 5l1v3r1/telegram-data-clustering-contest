      <p>Incredible footage shows the moment an enormous python leaps from a pond to catch a wild deer as it drinks.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate animal was with several other members of its herd as they stopped to rehydrate at the pool of water in Maharashtra, India.</p>
      <p>The CCTV footage shows the herd of deer sensing danger at the watering hole as they timidly go back and forth to the water’s edge.</p>
      <p>But it isn’t long before the serpent seizes its opportunity to ambush the helpless animal by rocketing out of the water at lightening speed.</p>
      <p>It then sinks its fangs into the deer as it goes in for the kill on the muddy banks of the swamp in the Karwa forest.</p>

      <p>The shock of the attack sees the deer squirming but only for a brief moment as the snake quickly coils itself around its prey and wrestles until its lifeless.</p>
      <p>For almost a minute, the snake, now tightly knotted around the deer, squeezes as the pair bob in the shallows of the water.</p>
      <p>The Central Chanda Forest Department released CCTV footage on November 21 showing the eye-popping incident.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra is rich in biodiversity, with the central-western Indian state home to at least seven national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.</p>
      <p>Last month, a 15-foot python weighing nearly 70kg was rescued from a sugarcane field in Hapur that took six men to remove it from the village, ANI, an Asian media site, reported.</p>
      <p>Gyanendra Tiwari farmer told ANI: While working on the farm we saw a long python, after which we informed the other local villagers who reached the spot and caught the python.”</p>
      <p>The Forest Department released the snake near to the river.</p>
