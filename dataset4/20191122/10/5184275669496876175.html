      <p>Actress Katrina Kaif, who has upped her own ante with performances in films like “<a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/bharat-movie-review-not-salman-khan-ali-abbas-zafar/"><i>Bharat</i></a>” and “<a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/zero-reviews-fake-from-deepika-padukone-to-narendra-modi-everyone-is-talking-about-it/"><i>Zero</i></a>“, says she is now keen on taking up roles that will give her the space and opportunity to invest, get her teeth into the character and explore it.</p>
      <p>“I am keen on taking up roles that will give me the space and opportunity to really invest, get my teeth into the character and explore it. I want to take up roles that will allow me the kind of level of performance which I was able to experience in ‘<i>Bharat</i>‘ and ‘<i>Zero</i>‘,” Katrina said.</p>

      <p>The actress’s performance as <i>Babita</i> in the Shah Rukh Khan starrer <i>Zero</i> was widely appreciated by the critics and audience alike.</p>
      <p>Would she like to play a similar personality in another film?</p>
      <p>“I need to now make sure that I am only connecting with the films and characters that will challenge and inspire me to bring a new aspect out. When you get unanimous praise, it is always very encouraging. It is a wonderful feeling because your work is very personal, so what you do when it comes from a personal space, that acknowledgment is also equally personal,” she said.</p>
      <p>Katrina, whose film <i>Zero</i> will be airing on &amp;Pictures on Saturday, says her method or the approach to get into the skin of the character is by going with the instinct and the director’s vision.</p>
      <p>Katrina further said, “I felt I had very strong instincts which worked for me. Now as time has passed, I have tried to analyze and learn more about making movies, creating characters and storytelling. I have started to find what works more is understanding the mindset of the character.</p>
      <p>The <i>Bharat</i> actress concluded, saying, “Understand your character’s background, her needs, her wants, her fears, her mindset, her overall personality; then whatever you are given to do becomes more true and real rather than just being an actor.”</p>
