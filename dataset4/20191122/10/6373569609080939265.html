      <p>The goal-laden career of former Plymouth Argyle striker Bradley Wright-Phillips at the New York Red Bulls is over.</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips is out of contract after the end of the 2019 Major League Soccer season and it was announced on Thursday that the 34-year-old will not be offered a new deal.</p>
      <p>He scored a total of 126 goals in 240 appearances for the Red Bulls over seven highly successful campaigns.</p>
      <p>Red Bulls sporting director Denis Hamlett said: “Brad will go down as one of the best forwards in MLS history, and certainly a major part of the success of this club since he arrived in 2013.”</p>

      <p>“Brad has had an incredible run with this club and will be remembered here as a great player, team-mate and person.</p>
      <p>“We thank him for all that he has accomplished and helped the club accomplish.”</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips wrapped up his seventh season in New York with one goal and an assist in seven games.</p>
      <p>He finished his career with the Red Bulls with a franchise-best 108 regular season goals.</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips also won two Golden Boot awards, was a two-time Best XI and two-time MLS All-Star, and the first player in MLS history to have at least three different seasons with 20 or more goals.</p>
      <p>He also played a large role in the Red Bulls securing three Supporters’ Shields, for the club with the best record in the regular season.</p>
      <p>In seven seasons with New York, Wright-Phillips recorded 240 matches, 205 starts, 18,471 minutes played, 126 goals and 35 assists across all competitions.</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips spent 18 months at Argyle after signing in the summer of 2009 and scored 17 goals in a total of 32 starts and five substitute appearances.</p>
      <p>He was sold to Charlton Athletic in January 2011 to pay off a tax bill owed to HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips was released by Charlton after the 2012/13 season, which is when he started his career with the Red Bulls.</p>
