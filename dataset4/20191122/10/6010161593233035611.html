      <h3>Green Man Gaming Black Friday Deals</h3>
      <p>One interesting thing to note about the Green Man Gaming Black Friday Deals is that games with a +5 in the corner will come with five free games! The games are probably random and may not be the best, but you really can’t argue with free. This is on top of the games themselves being discounted!</p>

      <h3>Who is Green Man Gaming?</h3>
      <p>Green Man Gaming is a digital storefront that sells PC and PlayStation game keys to consumers. Generally, the validity of sites that sell keys like this aren’t always on the up-and-up, but Green Man Gaming is a reputable seller. They do not resell keys and offer a guarantee that any key bought from them will be replaced or refunded if there’s a problem.</p>
      <p>For PC games, Green Man Gaming will sell keys for various platforms. For example, Borderlands 3 will be an Epic Games Store key, while the Rage 2 key is for Bethesda’s digital platform. While most games will be Steam codes, not all of them are, so pay attention while checking out if you prefer one storefront over the others.</p>
      <p>When it comes to Green Man Gaming Black Friday deals, though, you can be sure to know that you’re buying from a trusted and reputable source.</p>
