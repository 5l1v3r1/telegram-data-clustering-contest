      <p>Lil Fizz posted and deleted a promotional post for Fashion Nova Men, which he captioned, "On the phone with yo BM in my @fashionnovamen." The post was seemingly a dig at his fellow B2K member Omarion, whose baby mama Apryl is now dating Lil Fizz in a situation that has taken over the internet. </p>
      <p>Omarion <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258979/omarion-breaks-his-silence-on-lil-fizz-apryl-jones-relationship?page=2">addressed the situation</a> in his now-viral interview with VladTV, where he said that he doesn't feel any way about Apryl and Lil Fizz dating. Omarion then added that he would like to be left out of their "narrative." </p>
