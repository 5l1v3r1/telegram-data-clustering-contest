      <p>A <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> cinema, woodland grotto and Robin Hood panto is just some of the festive fun waiting for good little boys and girls at Santa's sleepover.</p>
      <p>Taking place on selected days from Sunday, December 15 to Monday, December 23, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/family-kids/amazing-alton-towers-rollercoasters-loved-3424986">Alton Towers </a>will be temporarily re-opening its gates for some Yuletide magic.</p>
      <p>Tickets start from around £450 for a family of four and includes an overnight stay in the Explorer Rooms, a festive-themed evening of entertainment, breakfast in the Secret Garden restaurant, a nine-hole round of Extraordinary Golf, an evening meal, entry to the Robin Hood panto, admission selected rides in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/family-kids/alton-towers-opens-cbeebies-land-183599">CBeebies Land</a>, Mutiny Bay, Adventure Land and Gloomy Wood, entry to the waterpark and a choice of two Christmas experiences.</p>
      <p>As part of the package families can pick between either meeting the elves in the heart of CBeebies Land before following them down Mistletoe Lane to Santa's cosy woodland grotto (includes family photo with Father Christmas) or tucking into Mrs Claus' breakfast where Sir Algenon and his friends will share stories of their explorations to the North Pole, elves will sing festive songs and there will be a visit from Santa himself.</p>
