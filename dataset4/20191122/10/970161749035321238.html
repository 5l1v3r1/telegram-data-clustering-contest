      <p>A shocking video has emerged of a pet groomer throwing a cat against a wall after it appeared to bite him.</p>
      <p>In the security footage, a topless man can be seen holding down the animal at Carolina Grooming, in Charleston, South Carolina, while another worker tries to cut its fur.</p>
      <p>The cat then repeatedly struggles against the groomer, causing him to yell out before losing his temper and violently hurling it against the wall.</p>

      <p>He then walks away from the table as a female worker shouts: ‘Babe, you can’t do that. You should have just let him go.’</p>
      <p>The incident was captured in May this year, but has only now been released by a previous manager, allegedly because he had been let go.</p>

      <p>Marcia Alfaro, who owns the cat in the video, told News 2 the footage made her feel sick to her stomach.</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘I can’t even watch it, I can’t see my baby hurt.’</p>
      <p>Daryl Kornickey, who owns Carolina Grooming, claims the man in the video was fired immediately after he saw the security footage.</p>
      <p>He says he retired three years ago due to poor health, and had left manager David Thomas in charge of hiring staff.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.live5news.com/2019/11/20/lowcountry-groomer-responds-video-circulating-social-media-showing-man-throwing-cat/">Live 5 News</a>, the employee in the video was hired by Mr Thomas, who allegedly leaked the clip because he has since been let go.</p>
      <p>Mr Kornickey said: ‘He made some bad hires and because of him being fired, now he wants to try to take down my business.’</p>
      <p>He added that he has since resumed the reins of his business, telling customers he will ‘always be watching and visiting’ from now on.</p>

      <p>However, Mr Thomas has contested the claims and says Mr Kornickey refused to fire the worker after the incident.</p>

      <p>He told ABC News 4: ‘During that incident, I wasn’t there. I was home recovering from getting my teeth pulled. The guy that got bit, I wanted to fire him, and Daryl told me don’t do it.’</p>
      <p>He confirmed that he did post the video, but said he had only waited until now because the business owner had been his neighbour up until recently.</p>
      <p>Mr Thomas said: ‘I’m not gonna go out there and stir the pot just to watch it bubble in my face.’</p>
      <p>Charleston County Sheriff’s Office said his agency say they are now launching an investigation of the incident, after the video emerged online.</p>
      <p>Ms Alfaro has stated that she does not plan to press charges.</p>
