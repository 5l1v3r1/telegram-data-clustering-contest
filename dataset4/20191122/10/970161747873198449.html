      <h1>Like Coldplay, I quit touring for climate reasons</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:45:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/william-doyle/" target="_blank">William Doyle</a></address>
      <p>In 2017, I was the support act on a tour that travelled across Europe and North America by bus.</p>
      <p>One night in the US, I stood outside the bus and listened to the air conditioning whirring through the open door. I realised that we’d not really turned the bus off for over two weeks. We still had three weeks of tour to go.</p>
      <p>Our two weeks of constant bus power suddenly seemed far more frightening when multiplied by the similar journeys of all of the other bands I saw arriving at our final stop, at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/14/coachella-located-pronounce-correctly-9199951/">LA festival </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/coachella-festival/">Coachella</a>. It was the first time I’d truly considered the environmental impact of what it means to be a touring musician.</p>
      <p>The news this week that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/coldplay/">Coldplay</a>, one of the most successful bands in the world, would be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/coldplay-wont-tour-unless-carbon-netural-release-new-album-11192847/">pausing their touring</a> until they could find a more carbon-neutral strategy, is a major step toward a change of consciousness around this issue in the music industry.</p>

      <p>The environmental impact of a Coldplay gig will be massive, from the multiple lorries of staging and musical equipment, to the band and their entourage’s international flights and ground transport. Not to mention the impact of each travelling fan, the disposable catering, and merchandise.</p>
      <p>In the face of all this, the decision to tour or not to tour is difficult to make. Since that tour in 2017, I decided to stop for the sake of both my mental health, and also because I couldn’t fathom how to make it more environmentally sustainable. But now, with the release of a new album, I’m faced with the dilemma of how to promote it responsibly. As an artist, this is perhaps the only thing I share in common with Coldplay.</p>

      <p>A simple solution would be never to tour again, but this ignores the fact that not only is touring the primary revenue stream for many artists (including myself), but that the experience of live music is life-affirming, and it’s a way of communing with others and expressing emotion together. </p>
      <p>It’s vital that this freedom is protected, and that the opportunity is afforded to as many people as possible.</p>
      <p>There are other ways to lessen the impact of a tour. Some options that have recently been picked up by big-name artists such as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a> and The 1975 include banning plastic and encouraging recycling at shows, as well as backing reforestation projects, and making sustainable merchandise.</p>

      <p>Other solutions may include alternative touring methods, either by taking trains instead of planes, or an investment in electric vans – an option that has yet to be fully explored. </p>
      <p>It’s important that the institutions around the artists, from record labels to festivals, also commit to and be held accountable to the same standards as the artists themselves – after all, none of us can make the necessary changes alone. The organisation <a href="https://www.musicdeclares.net/">Music Declares Emergency</a> was recently formed to catalyse these sorts of ideas and support artists. But it’s also important that artists take action individually.</p>
      <p>Though the climate crisis has been caused chiefly by gigantic energy corporations, it is our collective responsibility to alter our behaviour and create a new culture of accountability. A band with the privilege and resources that Coldplay have are exactly the kind of group who should be trailblazers for a new philosophy of touring that will trickle down to acts of all levels.</p>
      <p>That tour I took in 2017 was a turning point for me. After that, I stopped eating meat and significantly reduced my touring schedule as a concession to the environment. I’m excited to do so much more as I start playing more shows in the next year.</p>
      <p>Artists are often people with strongly held principles and values, and so our commitment to a society and industry that puts the interests of humanity first is essential.</p>
