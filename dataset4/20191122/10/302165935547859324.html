      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 22 — The ringgit closed the week on a weaker note against the US dollar on lack of buying interest as uncertainties continued in the US-China trade negotiations, said a dealer.</p>
      <p>At 6pm, the ringgit settled at 4.1700/1750 against the greenback from yesterday’s close of 4.1680/1710.</p>
      <p>The dealer said the fall in the local note was in line with other Asian currencies, with investors’ numbness over the US-China trade deal “optimism” continued to weigh on market sentiment, causing investors to stay on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the local note traded mostly higher against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit was better against the Singapore dollar at 3.0590/0638 from 3.0607/0633 on Thursday, appreciated against the euro to 4.6116/6188 from 4.6202/6252 and rose versus the British pound to 5.3672/3753 from 5.3946/3002.</p>
      <p>The local note, however, fell against the yen to 3.8412/8469 from 3.8404/8435. — Bernama</p>
