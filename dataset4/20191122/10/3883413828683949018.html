      <p>In one letter, typed on paper headed 'Bing Crosby, Hollywood' and dated 10 April 1945, the musician wrote: "It was a pleasure working for the boys in France and Belgium, in fact, one of the richest experiences of my life."</p>
      <p>In some of the letters, he told the soldiers families that he had met their loved ones.</p>
      <p>In correspondence, the families replied thanking the singer for bringing joy and hope to their sons, husbands and brothers.</p>
      <p>Beth Du Bois was one of the mothers who wrote to Mr Crosby, dates March 5, 1944, she said: "It gives me a strangely comforting feeling to know that someone whose voice I can hear has so recently talked with my son whom I have not seen for almost two years.</p>
      <p>"It brings them nearer somehow."</p>

      <p>In a letters, sent to Mrs. Philip K, Lawler, dated February 28, 1941, Mr Crosby wrote: "You were very nice to send me excerpts from your husband’s letter written in France and describing our show there for the mighty 79th Division.</p>
      <p>"I’m going to keep this letter handy because it provides an exact reminder of our routine overseas, and when anyone asks me what we did, I need only to whip it out, and let them read the complete details.</p>
      <p>"The audience was the greatest I ever faced - warm, receptive, eager and we left there entirely conscious that we'd just been given a rare privilege, the privilege of bringing even a small touch of home, a few laughs and some sighs to a wonderful bunch of men during a sensational job."</p>

      <p>During his lifetime, Mr Crosby won the Academy Award as Best Actor for his performance in ‘Going My Way’, in 1944.</p>
      <p>Robert S Bader, who is vice president of the company in charge of Bing Crosby's estate, said he was "overwhelmed" by finding the letters and photographs.</p>
      <p>"He kept these deeply personal letters in a safe place apart from everything else," Mr Bader said.</p>
      <p>"The letters from the soldiers' family members are often heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>"These people felt such a deep connection to this man they only knew as a famous entertainer.</p>
      <p>"And he lived up to their faith in him with equally heartfelt letters back to them."</p>
