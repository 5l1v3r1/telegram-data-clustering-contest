      <p>If you’re a Sky customer with sports channels then you can use <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/internet/3346993/how-watch-sky-go-on-laptop-or-pc/">Sky Go</a> to watch live coverage of games. The Sky Go app is available on various devices.</p>

      <h3>Watch NFL on BBC</h3>
      <p>The BBC isn't showing live games other than the London International Series, but does have a weekly highlights show called <b>NFL This Week</b> which you can watch on <b>BBC Two every Tuesday at 11:15pm</b> (technically Wednesday).</p>
      <p>It also has <b>The</b> <b>NFL Show</b> which is on <b>Saturday night (early Sunday morning)</b> and provides highlights of the Thursday night game. It's on <b>BBC One</b>.</p>
      <p>BBC coverage is hosted by Mark Chapman, Osi Umenyiora and Jason Bell.</p>
      <p>You can watch both on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3664360-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-nfl-uk-live-stream-3664360%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fiplayer%2Fepisode%2Fb0bj6k2h%2Fthe-nfl-show-201819-episode-1">BBC iPlayer</a>.</p>
      <h3>Live Stream NFL on Game Pass</h3>
      <p>The NFL Game Pass is the official online streaming service - a bit like Netflix just for American Football. It allows you to watch games live or on-demand throughout the season and available on the web or via various devices with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3664360-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-nfl-uk-live-stream-3664360%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.deltatre.nfl.gamepass">app</a>.</p>
      <p>Just bear in mind that any Sunday games shown live on Sky will be blacked out on Game Pass. You can still watch them on-demand 24 hours afterwards though.</p>
      <p>There's a main <b>Pro</b> subscription for the Game Pass which covers everything for <b>£149.99</b> (or £14.99 for 7 day access). You can also pay the annual fee in four installments.</p>
      <p>You can also opt for the <b>Essential plan</b> which is <b>£39.99</b> for the year but it only includes things like the NFL RedZone Live and game hightlights so is more suitable for the casual fan. </p>
      <p>Now the season is in full swing, those prices have been reduced to <b>£99</b> and <b>£29.99</b>. There's also a free option which provides 5 minute game highlights and NFL Network Live.</p>
      <p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3664360-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-nfl-uk-live-stream-3664360%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nflgamepass.com%2Fen%2Fsubscribe%2Fplans">Subscribe to the NFL Game Pass and also make use of the free 7 day trial</a>.</p>

      <h3>VPN</h3>
      <p>Services like Sky Go are geo-restricted outside the UK, but that doesn't mean you can't watch the NFL when you're overseas.</p>
      <p>All you need do is download and use VPN service such as <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3664360-11-0000000">NordVPN</a> that will mask your IP address and make it appear to the app that you are in fact in the UK. You can then browse Sky's services in your web browser and watch whatever you like.</p>
