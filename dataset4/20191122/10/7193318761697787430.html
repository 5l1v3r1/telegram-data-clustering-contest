      <p>From their endless energy and their cornucopia of radio hits to their never-ending supply of booming beats and their circus-caliber stage spectacle, The Chainsmokers made quite the impression in their Oklahoma City concert debut.</p>
      <p>The chart-topping electropop duo brought the North American leg of its massive “World War Joy” headline arena tour to OKC on Nov. 14 at Chesapeake Energy Arena, where a packed house of fans eagerly danced, sang and jumped along to their more than 90-minute set.</p>
      <p>Joined by ferocious drummer Matt McGuire, the DJ duo of Alex Pall and Drew Taggart dropped their infectious beats from under a enormous set resembling a fallen skyscraper, with beams that shifted throughout the show, even creating an intriguing climbing structure for Taggart in one of his many daredevil moments.</p>
      <p>While Pall coolly kept their electronic dance music pumping from under the industrial stage design, the seemingly inexhaustible Taggart raced around the stage, danced feverishly, played multiple instruments, led the audience in singalongs and crooned the title track to their 2018 album "Sick Boy" while running around the giant metal "Globe of Death" like a hysterical hamster.</p>
      <p>He wasn't the only one to venture into the 5,000-pound sphere: A trio of trick riders later zipped into the globe and zoomed around the inside on neon-trimmed motorbikes. The circus stunt didn't seem particularly out of place in The Chainsmokers' bombastic stage bonanza, which also features laser light barrages, pyrotechnic plumes and moving platforms. At one point, McGuire and a big drum kit ascended high above the catwalk bisecting the arena floor and played a thunderous solo with sticks that were literally on fire.</p>
      <p>The Grammy-winning duo launched its set with opening act Lennon Stella supplying her ethereal vocals on "Takeaway," The Chainsmokers' collaboration with the "Nashville" singer and fellow DJ Illenium. The musical highlight of the show, it set a dangerous precedent by pairing Taggart with an actual live singing partner.</p>
      <p>Naturally, The Chainsmokers brought their biggest hits to The Peake, but their most recognizable pop-crossover smashes are collaborations featuring talented vocalists: "Something Just Like This" with Coldplay, "Don't Let Me Down" with Daya, "Call You Mine" with Bebe Rexha,"Paris" with Emily Warren and the aptly-titled "Closer" with Halsey. Rather than letting the capable and appealing Stella handle all the vocal duties, the duo substituted distorted robot voices depicted on the monumental video screens as oversized, human-animal avatars. While the digital solution certainly fit the vibe of The Chainsmokers' music, it needlessly deprived the show of a live element.</p>
      <p>The superiority of the live music aspect was demonstrated again when Australian pop-rockers 5 Seconds of Summer, the tour's direct support, returned to the stage to perform their anthemic, singalong-ready joint single "Who Do You Love."</p>
      <p>From their own hits to familiar covers like The Isley Brothers' "Shout," Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Under the Bridge" and 2 Unlimited's "Get Ready for This," The Chainsmokers kept the beats banging, giving their fervent fans plenty of opportunities to rage the night away. Despite the spectacle and the showmanship, the joy had started to fade by the time the hitmakers wisely took their leave with the ubiquitous "Closer" and a last explosion of confetti and fireworks. They skipped the customary encore to leave the audience with its ears ringing, its blood still pumping to the beat and the earwormy lyrics still wriggling through their brains.</p>
