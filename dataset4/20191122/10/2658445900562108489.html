      <p>Investors in Nigeria’s creative industry have urged the federal government to review the statutory mandate of the National Orientation Agency (NOA) with a view to focus strongly on championing Made in Nigeria Goods campaign.</p>
      <p>According to the stakeholders who spoke on Thursday at an Investment Forum held at the on-going International Arts and Crafts Expo (INAC) organised by National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) in Abuja, the NOA is the engine room capable of transforming not only Nigerians thinking but also their perceptions.</p>
      <p>In his keynote paper titled Imperatives on creativity and product design in networking Nigerian arts and crafts, Prof Jerry Buhari of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, said the agency needs a man that has the spirit of an evangelist as its head to leas the campaign.</p>
      <p>“Imagine the NOA mobilises the country on a mother of all campaigns titled Use Made in Nigeria. We need a spirit of MAMSA to be injected into NOA. That office is the engine room of transforming not only Nigerians thinking but also perception. We need a man that has the spirit of an evangelist in that office. We should stop talking. I want to challenge the Ministry of Information and Culture to give directive to all its parastatals and agencies not to use imported furniture. Let’s promote made in Nigeria goods, that’s where the investment is,” he said.</p>
      <p>He lamented the dearth of culturally relevant edifices in most cities of the country that can house the nation’s priceless cultural objects for better appreciation. He urged government and corporate organisations to invest in providing facilities such as museum of modern art for the advancement of the nation’s heritage.</p>
      <p>“If you close your eyes and you are in some streets in Abuja, and you remove all the black people on that street, you would have been in anywhere in Chicago. To me, Abuja is a culturally neutral or blind city. There is hardly any national edifice that promotes or advances the rich traditional architecture that we have. Who were the builders of Abuja? In fact, what kind of brief were they given?,” he wondered.</p>
      <p>On the need to believe in ourselves and promote our culture, Buhari said: “Imagine President Buhari wears a made in Nigeria shoe. It will inspire many people to wear such shoes. However, we have the problem of ‘clean broom philosophy’ in government. That is, when a public officer comes into office, he believes there are spirits and demons. He gets rid of the old chairs, curtain and brings in new ones. But, I ask you, where is your history? They are lost forever. The table Jefferson used in US, is what Donald Trump uses today in White House. The attraction of Dubai doors is the fine finishing. But, any of those doors cannot stand good kicks as it will give way. And let rain drop on any of the doors, it is gone.</p>
      <p>However, there are lots of Nigerians doing great doors everywhere, why are we not patronising them? Our furniture and curtains should not be imported.”</p>
      <p>Managing Director Le Look, Mrs Chinwe Ezenwa wondered why NOA has been quiet over the campaign for the use of made in Nigeria goods, adding that it should do more. She recalled that Le Look was among the first organsiations that started promoting made in Nigeria goods 34 years ago. “I cannot be defined by the imitation of foreign goods. Why not buy made in Nigeria. I will lend my voice to the call on the current DG of NOA to be given a new mandate on how to promote Made in Nigeria Goods. All our ministries should wear made in Nigeria dresses at least once a week. It is even worse that many go to second hand market to buy dresses. Interestingly, Lo Look bags are used everywhere in the world. In August we produced 12000 bags for NBA, and we have just finished producing 7000 bags for SNE for their conference in Kano. To achieve this quality, we took our staff outside for training in proper packaging,” she added.</p>

      <p>Art Entrepreneur and producer of branded products, Mrs Maureen Chukwura who has improved the packaging of some Nigeria’s foodstuff for global market, said her organisation worked on the packaging of our foods in order to meet international standard. “I later undertook a tour of Europe in order to advance the value of our foods in terms of packaging. Also, some government policies were not friendly to investors. Ever since my exhibition at Akwaaba, I have been receiving calls from different parts of Africa,” she noted.</p>
      <p>International lawyer and Public Analyst, Mrs Christy Adejoh urged Nigerian entrepreneurs to determine what value to add to arts and crafts, adding that presentation of both creator and the objects is of great importance. She noted that sometimes creators of works like adire appear in t-shirt with inscription like Hilfiger. “With that there is disconnect. Also, some entrepreneurs cannot express themselves before a potential customer or investor. One thing we take for granted is the business etiquette, which is very suspect among culture workers. This will fetch you a loss by not applying the right social skill,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Ranti Ojo of University of Abuja, advocated for the reliance and development of indigenous technology as a starting point for advancement.</p>
      <p>“People perish because of lack of culture. We must build special interest in our indigenous technology. The level of one’s technology is the level of civilization. Unfortunately, we parade other peoples’ culture and civilization at the detriment of ours. Unknown to many, Benin city, of Edo State was a civilised society before America became a nation,” he noted.</p>
