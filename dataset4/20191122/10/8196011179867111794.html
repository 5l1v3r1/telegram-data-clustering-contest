      <p>SMALL retail businesses and service providers in Cork can look forward to a markedly more prosperous future as the city progresses through a generation of significant investments.</p>
      <p>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney told a group of 40 Cork business people to expect Cork to have 15 to 40 new 50-storey buildings, a new light rail system on wheels, completed M22 and M28 motorways, an enhanced Dunkettle Interchange and significant housing development in the coming years.</p>
      <p>The minister was addressing a business event entitled ‘Supporting Irish Business in an Ever-Changing Landscape’, hosted by Áine Collins, business development director at business finance consultants EFM Ireland, and former Cork North West TD for Fine Gael. The forum took place at the newly redeveloped Plato Family Business Network, Northside For Business Campus, Ballyvolane, Cork.</p>
      <p>“When I meet owners of small businesses, they tell me the benefits of the economic upturn are not trickling down to them,” said Mr Coveney. “The fact is that we are at the start of a very exciting period for Cork business.</p>
      <blockquote>“There is a great appetite for business in Cork, and we are seeing business funding coming here that we were not seeing in the past. If we keep with the policies outlined in the country’s 2040 plans, the opportunities will be immense.”</blockquote>
      <p>In the coming years, Cork city businesses will benefit from population growth of over 5,000 people per year, adding anything from 120,000 to 140,000 people by 2040. This would effectively double what were the city centre numbers from prior to the extension of the city boundaries.</p>
      <p>While local retail will need to continue to innovate to counter online competition, city centre trade will evolve to focus on servicing a revival in city centre living. Bórd Pleanála approval for 302 apartments on Horgan’s Quay and Railway Street will be the first of many new housing developments.</p>
      <p>“Admittedly, a lot of retail has moved online, but the city centre is already creating a café culture. Most of the people who will be living and working in the city centre won’t have cars and won’t want to drive out to shopping centres.”</p>
      <p>The proposed light rail system, linking the city west to Ballincollig and east to Tivoli, would certainly help reduce traffic. The city’s café culture could also be boosted by another unlikely plan to weather-proof one popular city street.</p>
      <p>“I was talking to one architect who is looking at what it would take to put a roof over Oliver Plunkett Street,” said Mr Coveney. “As more and more people come to live in the city centre, a different type of retail activity will develop.</p>
      <p>“We will also see business and housing developments in the Docklands, accompanied by a more sustainable urban environment. When the new events centre is built [on the old Beamish brewery site], it will be full four or five times a week, leading to a lot of new social activities in an area that is already a student quarter. There will be new accommodation for 5,000 students at South Terrace.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the minister says he would like to see the city progress with plans for flood defences in the city centre. He has met with members of Save Cork City, a group opposed to the proposed defences.</p>
      <p>“We really do need flood defences,” said Mr Coveney.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is not a question of making a choice between flood defences versus tidal barriers — which may also happen some time in the future. The more immediate concern is that the €250m allocated to works on the city’s flood defences could be lost to other projects around the country that are ready to go.”</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, Áine Collins outlined how EFM Ireland is supporting Irish business through providing professional business strategy and advisory services. Among other services, EFM provides flexible, part-time finance directors to companies which need financial business strategy, advice and planning, but who may not require to hire full-time in house.</p>
      <p>The event was also addressed by JJ O’Connell, national director and co-chair of Family Business Ireland and of the Plato Ireland Business Network, who has rebuilt the former derelict site of the Ballyvolane Enterprise Centre to facilitate a purpose- built centre for family business and family business planning in the north Cork region, supported by the Local Enterprise Offices and Cork City Council.</p>
      <p>JJ O’Connell stated: “We have created a safe environment here at Plato, where business owners can receive expert inputs and interchange with peers.</p>
      <p>“Many owner-managers suffer from isolation, and often may not know how to tackle certain issues they might be facing. At Plato, we provide practical training, business counselling and support, and offer a dedicated improvement plan for each business that comes through our doors.”</p>
