      <h1>Crystal Palace 'want January deal for Olivier Giroud'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> are reportedly keen on a January deal for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/olivier-giroud/"><b>Olivier Giroud</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The France international - also linked with the likes of Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund - has only made four Premier League appearances for Chelsea during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old will see his contract at Stamford Bridge expire this summer, and it is widely thought that the experienced striker will seek pastures new at the start of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Express</i>, Palace want to complete a January deal for the 2018 World Cup winner, but the Eagles will struggle to afford the Frenchman's salary.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the report claims that Giroud is looking for a two-year deal worth Â£7m a season, which could price <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-hodgson/"><b>Roy Hodgson</b></a>'s side out of a mid-season swoop.</p>
      <p>The former Grenoble youngster has scored 19 times in 69 appearances for Chelsea since joining the club from capital rivals Arsenal in January 2018.</p>
