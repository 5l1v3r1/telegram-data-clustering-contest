      <p>"I’ve just told her she’s going to run two marathons in the future. She’s just pissed herself laughing and gone straight to the bottom shelf on that cake stand.</p>
      <p>"It’s never too late to change. Going to take her back to this very spot one day and recreate this photo. Just need to find that bloody t-shirt. It was my favourite. Wore it for Kate’s birthday. Thought I was being dead fancy because it’s got Nike in gold on it.</p>
      <p>She added: "Currently telling the story of how this little cherub went from cake stands to WAKING THE F*CK UP.” [sic]</p>
      <p>Adele also shared the ten year throwback photo challenge on Instagram before entering the jungle, showing her wearing very similar outfits, but looking visibly different.</p>
