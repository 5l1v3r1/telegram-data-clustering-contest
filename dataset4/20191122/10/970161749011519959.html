      <p>Dan Osborne has admitted it’s ‘horrible’ seeing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>’s Jacqueline Jossa emotional in the jungle.</p>
      <p>No, you’re crying.</p>
      <p>The former Towie star<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-married-dan-osborne-children-11175824/"> is clearly feeling for his wife</a>, leaving an event in Manchester early to watch the show in his car.</p>
      <p>Dan could be seen poring over the show on his tiny phone screen, before embarking on the long drive home.</p>

      <p>Speaking on his Instagram Stories, he said he’s adamant to support his beau.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously it’s horrible seeing Jac upset because she’s missing the girls,’ he said. ‘I knew she’d miss the girls but she’ll be fine, she’ll get on with it.</p>
      <p>‘Talking about them probably helped so it’s nice that she’s got people in there that she can talk about the kids [with].</p>

      <p>‘She’ll share some nice memories I’m sure.’</p>
      <p>Reassuring fans that the girls – Ella and Mia – are in ‘safe hands’ with his mum, Dan added: ‘When they wake up in the morning, daddy’s there, they’re in good hands and, before you know it, they’ll be in Australia waiting for Jac when she gets out of there.’</p>

      <p>Praising his wife’s co-star Ian Wright, Dan explained: ‘It’s clear he’s got a lot of respect for her, and he’s one of my absolute idols, which is sick.’</p>
      <p>Silver linings, eh?</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-tears-wakes-jungle-homesick-11197585/">was seen breaking down in tears due to missing her family in a recent episode of the show.</a></p>

      <p>She explained: ‘I just woke up feeling a bit like “mmmm” when you’re just looking up at pure jungle and you think “wow, I’m so far away from home”.</p>

      <p>‘The thing is, everyone is missing their families, I just feel like it’s too soon to be crying missing your family…and we all smell so bad, we just stink, I stink, the smelliest I’ve ever been in my life.’</p>
      <p>Ian sat next to Jacqueline and comforted her as she was crying, reassuring her that she won’t always be away from her family.</p>
      <p>Talking in the hut afterwards, Ian commented: ‘She misses her kids which is natural, she misses her husband, everything like that.’</p>
