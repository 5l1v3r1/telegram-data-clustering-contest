        <b>CELTIC have released their annual Christmas advert this morning.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> posted the highly anticipated video just after 10am as they revealed their 'Star of Lisbon' tribute.</p>

      <p>Players and staff all heavily featured in the advert along with young kids signing along to the tune of 'Christmas Star'.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead side announced the news on social media, saying: "ðŸŒŸ Star of Lisbon, Star so bright, Star of Glasgow's Green &amp; White #CelticChristmasAd2019ðŸŽ­ #CelticFC #Christmas2019."</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the vid, there is a poignant tribute to the late Billy McNeill, with a clip of Cesar lifting the European Cup.</p>
      <p>One point that will interest Hoops fans is how heavily featured Leigh Griffiths is.</p>

      <p>The striker has been absent for the best part of a year through injury and personal issues.</p>
      <p>However, he can be seen having a laugh with his Parkhead team-mates and getting into the festive spirit.</p>
      <p>The Hoops Twitter account even joked saying: "@Leighgriff09, the only guy in Glasgow who doesn't wanna be @Oedouard22!"</p>
      <p>The advert starts with legend Bertie Auld laying Christmas crackers on a tree as he reminisces about the great players to grace the Parkhead turf.</p>
      <p>Star man Odsonne Edouard is also one of the main men in the advert, along with skipper Scott Brown as expected.</p>
      <p>New men Boli Bolingoli, Mohamed Elyounoussi and Greg Taylor played cameo roles.</p>

      <p>Utility man Jonny Hayes also has a laugh pretending to fly a propeller plane with the aid of forgotten man Scott Sinclair.</p>
      <p>And at the end of the short three-minute video, gaffer Neil Lennon is seen conducting a choir signing the tune.</p>
      <p>A mixture of the Hoops squad and young fans stand before Lenny as he waves his hands to get a get the carols going.</p>
      <p>The original song created for the ad, 'Star of Glasgow's Green and White' has been released as a charity single with the proceeds going to the Celtic Foundation's Christmas appeal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Celtic-daft <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4982896/celtic-fc-news-alan-brazil-rangers-steven-gerrard/">Alan Brazil has made a sly joke about Steven Gerrard's wait for the Liverpool job in years to come</a>.</p>
      <p>The radio host cheekily took a swipe at the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> boss as he discussed potential managerial changes this morning.</p>
      <p>Speaking on talkSPORT, the Hoops fan made the point that clubs in England seem to be backing British managers more these days.</p>
