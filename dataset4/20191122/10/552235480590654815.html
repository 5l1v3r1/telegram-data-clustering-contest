      <p>A Scottish shopping centre has a sweet <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas tree</a> where underprivileged children can hang a Christmas wish so a member of the public can donate it.</p>
      <p>The 'Giving Tree', located in the Forge Shopping Centre, in Glasgow, has little tickets hanging on the tree with a gift that each child would like for Christmas.</p>

      <p>The little tickets share the age of each child and ask for donations such as a cinema gift card, a warm jacket and a selection box. </p>
      <p>Members of the public are encouraged to take a ticket and donate what is on it. </p>
      <p>The charity With Kids is hoping to spread a little Christmas cheer for children who find the festive period difficult.</p>
      <p>The 'Giving Tree' hopes to help each child feel the same as many other children do on Christmas morning - the excitement of seeing more than one present under the tree. </p>
      <p>Donations can also be made online via the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/withkids?fbclid=IwAR07AYw0Nb8NTrqePH2hCpNXscfCiYx8reHCv2aF1iqq_O8H8FUJGtTBxWI">Just Giving page here</a> . </p>
