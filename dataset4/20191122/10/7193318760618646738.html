      <h1>Still rolling: Mannheim Steamroller's 35th annual Christmas tour is coming to Oklahoma City</h1>

      <p>For a dozen years, Tom Sharpe has relished becoming a part of people's yuletide traditions.</p>
      <p>"All of the people that you're bringing this joy to really makes it worth it. It's not necessarily, 'Do you like to work for the holidays or do you not?' It's just a matter of where in your life are you best serving," he said. "It is hard to be away on Christmas, but when I think of it from a perspective of how many thousands of people a night that we're spreading this joy to, it really sheds a new light on it."</p>
      <p>This time of year, Sharpe performs in the glow of a kaleidoscopic light show and massive LED screens as the drummer for Grammy Award-winning holiday staple Mannheim Steamroller. The brainchild of record producer and composer Chip Davis, Mannheim Steamroller boasts two ensembles traveling the country this season on a 35th anniversary tour that includes an annual Oklahoma City stop Tuesday at the Civic Center Music Hall.</p>
      <p>"It actually makes it the longest-running tour in entertainment history. ... Honestly, I think it's because it was just so incredibly groundbreaking when it came out. It was visionary," Sharpe said. "With the rich tradition of it dating back to that first Christmas album in 1984, there's always a vision forward, too, and the show is constantly evolving. Chip really is great at keeping the balance of having the pieces in the concert that people expect to hear — the Christmas hits that he has arranged in this unique way — and also adding new things all the time."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Childhood memories</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sharpe said he still remembers the first time he heard Mannheim Steamroller as a teenager.</p>
      <p>"I was 13 years old when the first album came out, and I still remember listening to it and just going, 'Wow, I need to listen to that again,'" he said. "What did Christmas music sound like before Mannheim Steamroller? ... With just the revolutionary uniqueness of the music, really, nothing else sounds like it."</p>
      <p>Driven by his fascinations with musical history and technological tinkering, Davis began experimenting in the 1970s with a distinctive style he called “18th-century classic rock” that merged Renaissance instruments and classical sounds with rock beats and synthesizers.</p>
      <p>Under the name Mannheim Steamroller, a wordplay on an 18th-century German musical technique, he recorded an instrumental album titled “Fresh Aire” but couldn’t find a record company willing to take a chance on the unusual sound. So, Davis started his own label, American Gramaphone, and released a series of "Fresh Aire" albums, eventually winning a Grammy for the seventh installment. He also took the then-unusual step into Christmas music, putting his ancient-meets-modern spin on classic carols like "Good King Wenceslas," "Deck the Halls" and "We Three Kings."</p>
      <p>1984's "Mannheim Steamroller Christmas" was a hit, which Davis followed with additional yuletide releases. Mannheim Steamroller has sold more than 40 million albums, 29 million in the Christmas genre.</p>
      <p>For Sharpe, a classically trained percussionist who has also toured with Dennis DeYoung, of the famed rock band Styx, Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas music hits a certain sweet spot.</p>
      <p>"It's a perfect blend between kind of that high-level classical sophistication and a real raw rock energy. ... I don't ever get bored with the show, because there's always something that I need to be physically and mentally prepared to do," said Sharpe, who is also the composer, artistic director and principal performer of the Sharpe World Music Ensemble.</p>
      <p>"It really is a full show with the visuals ... but, really, the focus is on Chip's arrangements and how they're able to be pulled off live. People just like to see us do it. I think that's one of the big differences between the concert and just cranking a CD is 'how is that actually able to be done?' ... It's really is amazing just to kind of watch everybody moving between instruments."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Christmas cheer</b>
      </p>
      <p>The holiday tour puts the six-person Mannheim Steamroller band on stage with a 20-person orchestra of top local players, and it puts many multigenerational families who have made the concert a longstanding Christmas tradition in the seats.</p>
      <p>"One of the great things about it is bringing this timeless music to new generations. ... For me, it's all about making that connection with the audience and having it be that the audience leaves feeling like that they didn't just see a concert but they really had an experience," Sharpe said.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I'm a really blessed guy that I'm doing this work. It feels like everything that I'm doing with my musical career, it doesn't feel like a job to me. It feels more like a calling."</p>
