      <h1>Watch Seth Meyers Recap the "Jaw-Dropping" Second Week of Impeachment Hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:24:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Russell  </a></address>
      <p>Week two of impeachment hearings has come to a close, and Seth Meyers dedicated his latest “A Closer Look” to recapping the madness swirling around the open-and-shut case of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a>’s corrupt Ukrainian quid pro quo. The <i>Late Night</i> host accurately refers to the hearings as “nothing short of jaw-dropping, with one bombshell after another,” joking, “Impeachment’s been so crazy, C-SPAN is turning into Howard Stern.”</p>
      <p>You likely already heard about former E.U. ambassador <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/gordon-sondland-flips-on-trump.html">Gordon Sondland’s especially damning testimony</a>, or at least the instantly infamous grin he flashed during the proceedings, which Meyers does his level best to recreate, adding later, “That is the face of a man who has no fucks left to give.”</p>

      <p>Meyers goes deeper than simply recounting Sondland’s implication of seemingly the entire Trump administration, as well as House Republicans’ flailing attempts to defend Trump (just try saying “no quid pro quo” five times fast). He also highlights the testimony of State Department official David Holmes, who corroborated Sondland’s account of Trump’s efforts to secure a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens, as well as that of former National Security Council official Fiona Hill, who recalls John Bolton referring to Rudy Giuliani as “a hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up.” These impeachment proceedings have undoubtedly been—and will continue to be—explosive.</p>
