      <p>Want a cheap gaming mouse deal for Black Friday? You can save big right now on their latest and greatest gaming mouse. The Corsair Ironclaw Wireless RGB is available on Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07QD1FP24">£53.99 (£16 off)</a>. Corsair is known for making some top-notch components and peripherals, as is pretty obvious if you check out any best-of lists. In particular, the Ironclaw is Corsair's state-of-the-art wireless gaming mouse, featuring an 18K DPI optical sensor, durable Omron mouse switches, and a 1000Hz report rate. The Ironclaw supports 2.4Ghz wireless or Bluetooth connectivity for up to 16hrs at a time even with its RGB lighting enabled. That's not bad at all.</p>
      <p>Featuring 10 fully programmable buttons and 3 RGB lighting zones, the Ironclaw has no shortage of customization options. And with storage for up to three on-board profiles, you can also make sure you're prepared for any battlefield. This particular wireless mouse includes Corsair's slipstream wireless technology, meaning that the Ironclaw can maintain its lightning-fast 1ms report rate over a wireless connection, a specification that rivals some of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/the-best-gaming-mouse/">best gaming mice</a> available. In other words, this cheap gaming mouse deal is excellent value for money.</p>
      <h3>Gaming mouse deal</h3>
      <p>Corsair makes remarkably durable hardware, and the Ironclaw is certainly no exception. While you'll likely never need it, the Ironclaw RGB includes a two-year hardware warranty as well should any part of your mouse give up the ghost. </p>
      <p>While this is an excellent deal, we get that choosing a mouse is an incredibly personal decision—and maybe this one isn't for you.
