      <p>Newly-elected Sri Lankan President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/gotabaya-rajapaksa-sworn-sri-lanka-president-191118072535784.html">Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> has announced he will call a snap parliamentary election "at the earliest opportunity" as he seeks to turn the country's parliamentary arithmetic in his favour after winning office last weekend.</p>
      <p>President Gotabaya said on Friday he would "consult the people" as soon as possible under <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/sri-lanka.html">Sri Lanka</a>'s constitution after appointing a new 16-member interim cabinet headed by his brother Mahinda, a former president who will now serve as prime minister and finance minister.</p>

      <p>Sri Lanka's existing parliamentary term ends next August, and the constitution allows the president to dissolve the legislature in March and go for an election.</p>
      <p>The president will hope to ride a wave of popularity and secure a majority for his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party in the 225-member Parliament of Sri Lanka during the poll. Currently, the Rajapaksas and their allies have just 96 legislators, making it hard for them to pass legislation.</p>
      <p>Former Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/ranil-wickremasinghe.html">Ranil Wickremesinghe</a> of the United National Party (UNP) stepped down on Thursday to make way for Mahinda to form an interim government.</p>
      <h3>'Reach out to Muslims, Tamils'</h3>
      <p>A former war-time defence secretary, Gotabaya won the presidency by a sizeable margin in the November 16 presidential vote, defeating former Cabinet Minister for Housing Sajith Premadasa, the candidate of the UNP-led coalition.</p>
      <p>In the lead-up to the presidential vote, Rajapaksa's campaign stressed on his credentials as the defence secretary which 10 years ago brought to a close the bloody 26-year civil war between government forces and Tamil rebels.</p>
      <p>The new president has pledged to fight corruption and improve security in the wake of a series of bombings on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/sri-lanka-bombings.html">Easter Sunday</a> that killed more than 260 people, responsibility for which was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) armed group. The government, however, blamed a local Muslim group for the worst bombings since the end of the civil war in 2009.</p>
      <p>The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month that Sri Lanka's economy was slowly recovering from the devastating effects of the April 21 attacks that hit the tourism sector - a major revenue earner - hard.</p>
      <p>Rights groups have long called for investigations into alleged rights abuses committed during the Rajapaksas' previous terms in power, including <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> allegations that more than 40,000 people were killed by security forces in the final days of the country's civil war in the north, as Tamil rebels took shelter among civilians.</p>
      <p>The new president also faces a civil suit in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> for allegedly ordering the torture of a Tamil man and several others when he was the defence secretary.</p>
      <p>Rajiva Wijasinha, a former member of Parliament, said the new president's biggest challenge would be to ease tensions heightened by the attacks.</p>
      <p>"The important thing for this government to do is to work with the Tamil and the Muslim people at grassroots level because I don't think they are interested in separatism or terrorism or fundamentalism," Wijasinha told Al Jazeera from Colombo.</p>
      <p>"They must reach out to the Muslims and the Tamils," he added.</p>
