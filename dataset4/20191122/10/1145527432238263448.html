        <b>Amid high buying interest, the share price of DHFL opened with a gain of 4.96% to the intraday high of Rs 22.2 on BSE today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) share price rose in early trade today amid reports of Gautam Adani-led Group and the Piramal Group being the top contenders for the takeover of the crisis-hit housing finance company. Apollo is also said to be in the fray to bid for the troubled company, IANS reported.</p>
      <p>Amid high buying interest, the share price of DHFL opened with a gain of 4.96% to the intraday high of Rs 22.2 on BSE today. The stock opened at Rs 22.2 and has since traded at this price.</p>
      <p>Market depth data on BSE suggests that there were only buyers and no sellers for the stock today. Volume-wise, 0.50 lakh and 7.44 lakh shares changed hands on BSE and NSE, respectively.</p>
      <p>The share price of DHFL has fallen 4.3% in a week and over 91% on a year-to-date basis. However, the stock has gained 8.82% in the last one month.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, apex bank RBI superseded the company's board, in a move to initiate insolvency proceedings for the resolution of the company, owing to governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations.</p>
      <p>DHFL is the first Housing Finance Company (HFC) or non-banking finance company (NBFC) to be sent to the bankruptcy court, under new rules notified by the government on 15 November.</p>
      <p>The RBI has also appointed R Subramaniakumar, ex-MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank, as the administrator of DHFL. DHFL, one of the biggest defaulters in the country currently owes almost Rs 1 lakh crore (over $14 billion) to its debtors.</p>
