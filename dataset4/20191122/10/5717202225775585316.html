      <p>Newcastle United manager Steve Bruce has heaped praise on Aston Villa star John McGinn, ahead of their reunion on Monday.</p>
      <p>The teams face off in the Premier League, and Bruce has admitted the impressive Scotland international is one of his best-ever signings.</p>

      <p>McGinn cost just £2 million from Hibernian in the summer of 2018 when Bruce was in charge at Villa Park, but his performances in the Championship and now the Premier League have seen his value soar to around £50 million (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/aston-villa-man-utd-transfer-news-john-mcginn-manchester-united-january-11168378/">Metro</a>).</p>
      <p>McGinn has been linked with a move to Premier League giants Manchester United, and Bruce believes he is more than good enough to play for the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>He said (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/steve-bruce-aston-villa-paying-2m-john-mcginn-best-ever-signing/">Telegraph</a>): “He has to be one of my best-ever signings because he has the determination to do well.</p>

      <p>“Yes, he can play at that level [Manchester United]. From what he has done in the last 12 months, he can only improve… he has done brilliantly. I always knew he would be good, but he has surpassed even my expectations.</p>
      <p>“He can go on to become a really top player. I wish I could find a few more like him. He scored twice again for Scotland the other night, so that’s six in three games.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – A gift from Bruce</h3>
      <p>It didn’t work out for Bruce at Villa, but supporters have to give him huge credit for bringing McGinn to their club.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old is one of the best players to grace Villa Park in years, and his £2 million fee is almost impossible to believe given his quality and consistency in the top-flight.</p>
      <p>The most realistic of Villa supporters will know it will be difficult for McGinn to stay at the club long-term, and will enjoy him while they can before he is inevitably poached.</p>
