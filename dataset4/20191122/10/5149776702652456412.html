      <p>Bristol City fans have been having their say on a pivotal looking Championship clash against Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a>'s men make the trip to Ashton Gate looking to continue the winning run started before the international break.</p>
      <p>Wins over Luton and Derby have left Forest in fifth place, ahead of Saturday's opponents on goal difference alone.</p>
      <p>The Robins also beat their rivals before the two week break, after breaking their hoodoo and winning in South Wales against Cardiff City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> have a poor recent record away at Bristol, having failed to win there since 2011.</p>
      <p>We took a look at popular fan forum <a href="https://www.otib.co.uk/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F204120-forest-merged%2F&amp;tab=comments#comment-3650255">OTIB</a> to get a flavour of how the Robins supporters are feeling ahead of the big game between two play-off hopefuls.</p>

      <p><b>1960maaan: </b>Forest 2 wins , 2 losses in last 4. Don't score too many, don't concede very many. Winnable , but feels like a 1-0 either way.</p>
      <p><b>Robbored: </b>Our home form is patchy at best and our away form is excellent so it wouldn’t be huge surprise to draw with Forest</p>
      <p><b>Mozo: </b>The Forest game has stalemate written all over it. It could be one of those games where neither side want to take too many risks and where if still level in the latter stages, they effectively enact a truce. A draw could keep both teams in the top 6, after all</p>
      <p><b>Davefevs: </b>I see similarities between Forest and us in the way we play</p>

      <p><b>Ska Junkie: </b>Tough game but with Fam and Korey looking to be back and Nagy and Kalas just returned, maybe the real BCFC might finally be unleashed. We've done bloody well for a team totally decimated by injuries so let's look forward to a nearly fully fit squad and some lovely football.</p>
      <p><b>Kingswoodactor: </b>Tough one this. They've won away at Fulham, Swansea and Luton (which we know is a tough place) and picked up a point on their travels to Leeds and Charlton too. 3 points would be huge here.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Popodopolous: </b>They are from what I've seen though, quite a reactive side- certainly not possession heavy, and this is the case even at home. They are also quite clinical but can veer between straight out clinical finishing or creating a lot of chances with not much possession. Shot dominance at the expense of midfield.</p>
      <p><b>Garland-Sweden: </b>They are a good team , so are we. Think its gonna be a good game. Trust LJ got the right tactic, 50-50 who will win. Nagy 90 minutes and Kalas third game is plus for us, Famara also back. We got good players and options who will play. Even I thought COD was good last game. Palmer got the magic in him.</p>
      <p><b>WendyRedRobin: </b>This one worries me a lot. I've watched Forest a few times and they look like at least a top 6 outfit to me. A damn sight better than Cardiff, I can tell you and this is a very big game for both sides. Our record following international breaks is not great so I hope Lee will keep them fit, motivated and raring to go.</p>
