      <h1>Sold out tickets for The Killers tour date at Ashton Gate now on sale for double the price</h1>
      <h2>Tickets for the Bristol tour date sold out on Ticketmaster and are now on sale on Viagogo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:46:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>Given the worldwide appeal of The Killers, demand for tickets to see them perform in Bristol was always going to be high.</p>
      <p>But surely not even the bosses at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ashton-gate">Ashton Gate</a>, where the gig will take place on June 9 next year, would have predicted them to sell out in just half an hour.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/killers-tickets-live-tour-bristol-3563498">Thousands of hopeful ticket buyers logged on to Ticketmaster's website</a> before the general sale at 9am, eager to see the iconic American rockers who took <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/glastonbury-festival">Glastonbury</a> by storm this year.</p>
      <p>But, rather like trying to secure tickets to the aforementioned festival, people were placed into an agonising online queue and greeted by a holding message.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Ticketmaster holding message</h3>
      <p>"Wow! Loads of people have turned up today.</p>
      <p>"As so many people are trying to book tickets, we’ve started a queue. Don’t refresh this page as you may lose your place in the queue.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for your patience."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Some people shared their success on social media when they managed to purchase one of the 32,000 tickets, but many others found themselves hopelessly refreshing their screens in hope of a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Then, just 30 minutes after tickets were released, the thousands stuck in the queue received the update they were all dreading - the gig had sold out.</p>
      <h3>Now on sale for double the price</h3>

      <p>Standing tickets were initially on sale for £71.50 on Ticketmaster - but are now being sold for £143 upwards on Viagogo.</p>
      <p>Viagogo is one of the biggest secondary ticket resellers and has been criticised in the past for not clearly spelling out additional fees including VAT and booking for buyers.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/06/number-of-viagogo-customers-dives-after-google-ad-ban">The Guardian reported</a> in October 2019 that visits to the online marketplace were down by two thirds after its adverts were banned from Google in July, when it was accused of breaching the search engine's advertising rules.</p>
      <p>While there's no doubting the band's quality or the fact they always put on incredible live shows, £143 is an eye-watering sum, even for the most ardent fans.</p>
