      <p><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/guide_pokemon_go_team_rocket_-_how_to_beat_infected_pokestops_and_purify_shadow_pokemon">Team Rocket</a> – or Team 'GO' Rocket, to be precise – has been causing all kinds of trouble in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a></b> lately, taking over PokéStops and capturing Pokémon to take part in their evil plans. Niantic has now announced that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/guide_pokemon_go_-_looming_in_the_shadows_walkthrough_mysterious_components_rocket_radar_and_battling_giovanni">Team GO Rocket</a> activity is going to increase later this week.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 24th from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in your local time zone, you can expect to see Team GO Rocket grunts taking over <i>every</i> PokéStop, as well as exclusive Field Research tasks designed from Professor Willow.</p>
      <blockquote>+ Battle Team GO Rocket Grunts, collect Mysterious Components, craft Rocket Radars, and defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders as many times as you can! Remember—after you craft your first Rocket Radar, you’ll be able to purchase additional Rocket Radars in the shop!<br/><br/>+ Complete the tasks above to make progress on the Special Research Looming in the Shadows, which will lead you straight to the Team GO Rocket Boss, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/guide_pokemon_go_-_looming_in_the_shadows_walkthrough_mysterious_components_rocket_radar_and_battling_giovanni">Giovanni</a>!</blockquote>
