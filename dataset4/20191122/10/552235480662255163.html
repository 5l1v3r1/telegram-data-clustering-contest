      <p>A puppy was left for dead in a park in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton">Hamilton</a> on the coldest night of the year.</p>
      <p>The SSPCA said the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">pup</a> , named Beans, was abandoned in a cardboard box and would "almost certainly" have died if it had not been discovered in a park in South Lanarkshire on Monday.</p>
      <p>The eight-week-old dog, believed to be a Jack Russell terrier cross, was found during <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/family-kids/how-keep-dogs-safe-warm-20920950">sub-zero temperatures</a> .</p>
      <p>Fortunately, it was found by a member of the public, who brought it in for the night before getting in touch with animal welfare groups.</p>
      <p>The hunt is on to find the dog's owner.</p>
      <p>Sarah Park, a rescue officer for the Scottish SPCA, said: "The dog was found in a cardboard box, lined with a blanket, at a local park near to Quarry Street.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"The young dog, which we believe is a Jack Russell terrier cross, is male and is around eight weeks old.</p>
      <p>"We are grateful to the member of the public who took him in and kept him safe overnight.</p>
      <p>"The night in question was the coldest so far this year and temperatures were below freezing.</p>
      <p>"Had he not been found, Beans would have almost certainly died so we are keen to find out the circumstances surrounding how he came to be in the park.</p>
      <p>"He is friendly so we suspect he is used to human contact.</p>
      <p>"One of our animal rescue and rehoming centres is providing the care he needs."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call the charity's confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.</p>
