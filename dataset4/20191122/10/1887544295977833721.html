      <p>VANCOUVER - A pioneering study of seven belugas in Canada's remote Arctic waters has found microplastics in the innards of every single whale.</p>
      <p>Researchers from Ocean Wise worked with hunters from the Inuvialuit community of Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., to collect samples from whales they harvested between 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>They found an average of nearly 10 microplastics, or particles less than five millimetres in size, in the gastrointestinal tracts of each beluga.</p>
      <p>The study was published last week in the Marine Pollution Bulletin and conducted in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Simon Fraser University.</p>
      <p>Ocean Wise says it is the first study of microplastics in a marine mammal in Canada.</p>
      <p>Lead author Rhiannon Moore says she wasn't expecting to see so many microplastics so far north.</p>
