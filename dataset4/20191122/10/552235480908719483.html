      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:53:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/watch-hyper-david-tennant-dance-14184702">David Tennant</a> is set to play one of Britain's most notorious serial killers in a new TV drama.</p>
      <p>The Scot actor will step into the shoes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/breaking-serial-killer-dennis-nilsen-12525875">Dennis Nilsen</a> in ITV's Des which tracks the monster's five-year campaign of terror.</p>
      <p>Twisted Nilsen murdered at least a dozen men between 1978 and 1983 and later admitted performing sex acts on some of their corpses.</p>
      <p>He lured his victims to two homes in North London, where they were strangled and drowned.</p>
      <p>The Scotsman, who initially admitted to killing 15, was convicted of six murders and two attempted murders in 1983, and was jailed for life in November that year.</p>
      <p>He was caught after a plumber discovered body parts and bones were causing a blockage to drains around his Muswell Hill home.</p>
      <p>Doctor Who star Tennant will lead a cast including <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/trainspottings-kelly-macdonald-play-tough-20913245">Line of Duty</a> star Daniel Mays as Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay and The Crown's Jason Watkin.</p>

      <p>The show, based on Brian ­Masters' book Killing For Company, follows police on their quest for justice in the wake of Nilsen's arrest.</p>
      <p>ITV’s head of drama, Polly Hill, said: “This starts with ­Nilsen’s arrest and is looking at him through the eyes of the police officer trying to identify those he killed and deliver ­justice.</p>
      <p>"David Tennant is going to be brilliant as Nilsen and, with Daniel and Jason, this has an incredible cast.”</p>
      <p>Former civil servant Nilsen burned his victims' bodies, or flushed body parts down the toilet during his sickening series of killings.</p>
      <p>If his victim was unconscious after being strangled, he would then drown them in a bathtub.</p>
      <p>He died in prison last May at the age of 72.</p>
      <p>Des is due to start filming soon and is believed to be aired next year.</p>
