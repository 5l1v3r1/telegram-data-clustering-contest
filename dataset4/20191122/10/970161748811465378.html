      <p>Forget the annual office Christmas bash – the party of the season has been announced and it’s all <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a>, everywhere.</p>
      <p>The creators of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/24/attention-please-a-popup-pug-cafe-is-coming-to-london-6731175/">Pug Cafe</a>, which have also given us the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/28/pupuccinos-ready-pomeranian-cafe-coming-london-9040301/">Pomeranian café </a>and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/16/the-worlds-first-sausage-dog-cafe-is-coming-to-the-uk-7318722/">sausage dog café</a> have revealed their latest pop-up and it might be their best one yet.</p>
      <p>Please welcome the doggy Christmas soiree, a one-off event on 8 December that will feature festive activities galore, with plenty of fabulous four-legged animals.</p>
      <p>Pugs, Pomeranians and dachshunds are encouraged to come along and snack on complimentary puppacinos, pawsecco and champaws, while sniffing butts and making friends.</p>
      <p>As for the snacks, there will be dog-friendly mince pies, canapés, festive pupcakes and more.</p>
      <p>There will be be a seasonal menu with cocktails and spritzes for humans, too.</p>
      <p>Here’s the best part: you don’t need to own a pooch to join in on the fun. The event is open to everyone (though you might want to check in with owners before you start cuddling up to their pets).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The day is split into six sessions, with each lasting 80 minutes and targeted at a different breed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pomeranians: 10am and 12.40pm</li>
        <li>Dachshunds: 11.20am and 3.20pm</li>
        <li>Pugs: 2pm and 4.40pm</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pug Cafe are hosting the event together with Pet Teezer, who will be giving away a dog brush (worth £12) to the first 350 dog owners to book a ticket.</p>
      <p>The brand’s grooming expert, Daniela Forshaw, will also be on hand to spruce-up shaggy coats and get pups ready for their photo ops.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pugcafe.com/">Tickets</a> cost £12 for dog owners, but dog lovers will need to fork out a few extra pounds at £15. Children aged 16 or under pay slightly less at £6 and £8, for dog owners and dog lovers respectively.</p>
      <p>The pooches however, get free entry (which is completely understandable – they are pretty amazing after all).</p>
      <p>Apparently, there will also be Instagram dog stars in attendance, though names have not been revealed.</p>
      <p>Count us in.</p>
