      <p>Social media platform Twitter is abuzz with rumours that <i>Bigg Boss </i>contestant Siddharth Shukla has been kicked out of the show. The microblogging site exploded after a Twitter handle, known for leaking information from inside the Colors TV’s reality show, claimed that Siddharth had faced eviction for repeatedly indulging in violence against Asim Riaz.</p>

      <p>Twitter handle ‘Khabri’ wrote, “Makers are planning something really very big for #SiddhartShukla. High chances of his eviction in #WeekendKaVaar.” It also reported that Khesari Lal Yadav had been evicted already adding that the early eviction of the Bhojpuri star was to ensure that Salman Khan pays full attention to the fight between Siddharth and Asim.</p>

      <p>No sooner did the claim on Siddharth’s eviction surface on Twitter, social media users went berserk in reacting to the tweet by ‘Khabri.’ While some felt that this was coming, others refused to believe the claim on Siddharth’s eviction saying that the makers of Bigg Boss lacked the conviction to take such strong action against the TV actor. Meanwhile, supporters of Asim Riaz have been trending hashtags in favour of their star.</p>
