      <p>Elon Musk has finally revealed the new Tesla Cybertruck, claiming some seriously impressive performance figures for the unconventionally styled electric bakkie.</p>
      <p>The US-based firm says the new six-seater Cybertruck (which interestingly uses an integrated canopy) employs an exterior shell made for “ultimate durability and passenger protection”. The “nearly impenetrable” exoskeleton is fashioned from "ultra-hard" cold-rolled stainless steel, while the glass has been armoured.</p>
      <p>Payload capacity comes in at a claimed 3 500 pounds (that’s nearly 1 600 kg), while towing capacity for the most powerful model is a claimed 14 000 pounds (or about 6 350 kg). Adjustable air suspension looks set to be offered across the range, too.</p>
      <p>So, what about those performance claims? Well, the Cybertruck will be offered in three forms. The first is a single-motor (rear-driven) variant, which Tesla says will hit 60 mph (97 km/h) from standstill in 6,5 seconds, while featuring a range of more than 400 km.</p>
      <p>Then there’s a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive variant, which the company claims will complete the sprint in less than 4,5 seconds, while offering a range of more than 480 km. Lastly, Tesla says the triple-motor flagship will travel more than 800 km on a single charge and vanquish the obligatory sprint in less than 2,9 seconds.</p>
      <p>The vehicle's approach angle is 35 degrees, while the departure angle comes in at 28 degrees, regardless of which variant you choose.</p>
