      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! Champ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> has the fright of her life tonight when she lifts up the bed covers to find a humongous python chilling on a pillow during tonight’s Bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-tension-jacqueline-jossa-andrew-maxwell-clash-bushtucker-trials-11197486/">came under fire from viewers and comedian </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> – who also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-ian-wright-and-andrew-maxwell-make-up-after-crocodile-feet-row-as-the-comedian-clashes-with-jacqueline-jossa-11197129/">clashed with Ian Wright</a> over crocodile feet, obviously – last night after she refused to take part in a draw to be banished to the Jailhouse.</p>

      <p>However, tonight’s she more than proves she’s got the prowess to deliver as she battles through a chamber of serpents to win food for camp, while Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson is locked in a box with some snakes of his own.</p>

      <p>Will the camp go hungry tonight or will Jacqueline silence her doubters with a full bag of stars for camp?</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-tears-wakes-jungle-homesick-11197585/">The 27-year-old broke down in tears</a> last night after admitting she was homesick. The actress has left behind her two daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, with husband Dan Osborne.</p>
      <p>I just woke up feeling a bit like “mmmm” when you’re just looking up at pure Jungle and you think, “Wow, I’m so far away from home,”’ she sobbed.</p>
      <p>‘The thing is, everyone is missing their families, I just feel like it’s too soon to be crying missing your family…and we all smell so bad, we just stink, I stink, the smelliest I’ve ever been in my life.’</p>
