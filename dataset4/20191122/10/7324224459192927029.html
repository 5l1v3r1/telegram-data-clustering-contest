      <p>The 27-year-old joined from Somerset in 2017 and has been a regular three-format player at the club and he has also drafted by Birmingham Phoenix for The Hundred next year.</p>
      <p>“I was made to feel very welcome by the players, coaches, staff and members when I joined Warwickshire. It’s a special club and I’m very proud to be a Bear until at least 2022,” said Hose.</p>
      <p>“The management have shown great faith in me by extending my current contract for a further two years and I want to reward them for that by contributing more match-winning innings.”</p>
      <p>Paul Farbrace, Warwickshire’s sport director, said: “Adam is a tremendously talented cricketer who has the ability to become a star of the white ball game, not just in the UK but in premier tournaments around the world.</p>
      <p>“However, we also see Adam as an important part of our long-term plans in all three formats and his challenge now is to refine his red ball game and to build on this year’s maiden first-class hundred, versus Nottinghamshire.”</p>
