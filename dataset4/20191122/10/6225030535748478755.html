      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Monomoy_Girl">Monomoy Girl</a></b>, 2018's champion 3-year-old filly, has resumed light training in Florida and should return to the Brad Cox barn at Fair Grounds after the first of the year, bloodstock agent Liz Crow said this week.</p>
      <p>Crow -- a manager for the partnership consisting of Monomoy Stables, Michael Dubb, the Elkstone Group, and Bethlehem Stables -- said Monomoy Girl has been cleared for jogging and light tack work at Paul Sharp's Williston, Fla., Farm, where she was broken and did her initial pre-training.</p>
      <p>The daughter of Tapizar has not returned to the starting gate since her victory in the 2018 Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs. She missed time the first half of this year due to colic before a muscle strain prevented a 4-year-old comeback later in the season.</p>
      <p>“She’s doing very well. She’s happy down here,” Crow said. “So far, no issues. She had pulled a hamstring. Dr. Wes Sutter been the one in charge of her recovery. He has looked at her multiple times and gave us the go-ahead to put her back in training.”</p>
      <p>Crow said Monomoy Girl should continue her work at the farm until January.</p>
      <p>“She’ll go back to the Fair Grounds with Brad Cox and start breezing again," Crow said. "I don’t think she will have lost much fitness because she wasn’t out of training that long. I think she still as a good bottom in her."</p>
      <p>As far as race targets, "Really, you're just kind of shooting in the dark when it comes to where you bring her back at this point because you just have to see how she comes along,” Crow added, but she mentioned Oaklawn Park's Apple Blossom (G1) run each April as a goal.</p>
      <p>Monomoy Girl shows a record of 9-for-11. She has been beaten across the wire just once, as a 2-year-old in Churchill Downs' Golden Rod (G2). At 3, she nearly went undefeated, suffering a loss only when placed second in Parx's Cotillion (G1) for veering in the stretch.</p>
      <p>Major targets as an older filly were put on hold in April but suffered no longterm effects due to her colic episode.</p>
      <p>"She never got opened up," Crow said. "She was just dehydrated. She had her last breeze at Fair Grounds, they shipped her up to Churchill, and I think she got dehydrated on the van ride."</p>
      <p>Monomoy Girl took time to recover and returned to breezing in the fall.</p>
      <p>“And then she pulled a muscle in her hamstring her last breeze before running," Crow said, as one prep was planned before a defense of the Distaff, "so we were very close to getting her back into the starting gate. Obviously with a muscle strain you have to go easy with them and give them plenty of time to get over it on their own.”</p>
      <p>Crow posted a video Thursday of Monomoy Girl taking a roll at the farm, adding that, “Everyone on her team is very happy with how she looks right now.”</p>
