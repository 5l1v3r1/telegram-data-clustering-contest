      <p>Al Pacino turns into a Nazi hunter in the new trailer for forthcoming Amazon Prime Video series <i>Hunters</i> – watch it below.</p>
      <p>A synopsis of the new show says: “Inspired by true events, <i>Hunters</i> follows a diverse band of Nazi Hunters in 1977 New York City who discover that hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in America.</p>
      <p>“And so, they do what any bad-ass vigilante squad would do: they set out on a bloody quest for revenge and justice. But they soon discover a far-reaching conspiracy and must race against time to thwart the Nazis’ new genocidal plans.”</p>
      <p>The show comes to the streaming service in 2020. You can watch the new trailer here:</p>

      <p>The trailer sees Pacino set about his plan to track down enemies within the United States, assembling his motley crew.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/al-pacino-jordan-peele-nazi-hunters-amazon-series-2563779"><i>Hunters</i> sees Pacino team up with <i>Us</i> director Jordan Peele</a>. The series is also set to feature Logan Lerman (<i>The Perks of Being A Wallflower</i>), Josh Radnor (<i>How I Met Your Mother</i>), Kate Mulvany (<i>The Great Gatsby</i>) and more.</p>
      <p>Al Pacino recently revealed that he’s developed a bad habit: <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/al-pacino-says-hes-started-starring-in-bad-films-to-try-to-make-them-better-2570250">he’s started starring in bad films to “try to make them better”</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m starting to want to do films that aren’t really very good and try to make them better.<i> </i>And that’s become my challenge,” he reveals.</p>
      <p>We’re assuming he doesn’t count new film <i>The Irishman</i> in this category. <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro">An <i>NME</i> review of the Pacino film</a>, which sees him work alongside Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro once again calls the trio “magnetic, riveting and unique.”</p>
