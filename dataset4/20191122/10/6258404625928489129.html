      <p>After initially launching its 5G network for business customers, AT&amp;T is making it available for is "regular" customers. For those looking to be early adopters on AT&amp;T's network, you can now preorder the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G  with an AT&amp;T installment plan. AT&amp;T will offer the smartphone in two colors, including Aura Glow and Aura Black.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/galaxy-note-10-5g">Galaxy Note 10+ 5G</a> will come in a version with 256GB of storage or a version with 512GB of storage. The 256GB version will sell for $1,299 at full retail price or $43.34 monthly on the installment plan. The version with 512GB of storage isn't much more expensive at $1,399.99 full retail or $46.67 monthly.</p>
      <p>Even though the smartphone can be used on AT&amp;T's 5G network, you won't be getting your money's worth if your area lacks 5G service, so users should check support for 5G in their area before ordering.</p>
      <p>The smartphone has a 6.8-inch AMOLED screen with 3040 x 1440 resolution and a rear-facing camera array that includes 12MP wide, 16MP ultrawide, and 12MP sensors along with 3D depth sensing. The front camera is a 10MP unit. The SoC is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, and power is from a 4300 mAh battery. Storage expansion supports up to 1TB microSD cards. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-10-5g-teardown-abyssal-repairability">Galaxy Note 10+ 5G was torn down</a> last summer, and inside, a few surprises were found along with horrible repairability. The battery, in particular, used lots of glue making that commonly replaced component hard to access. The device was found to have a trio of mmWave antenna modules to support better 5G connectivity.</p>
