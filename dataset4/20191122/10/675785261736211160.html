      <p>TSB has promised 'emergency payments' for customers affected by its latest meltdown which resulted in a number of people not receiving their wages on Friday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-thousands-tsb-bank-customers-20934337">lender said it's experiencing some "delays"</a>, with staff working tirelessly overnight to help resolve the problem.</p>
      <p>It's resulted in a number of missing payments - with customers unable to see their wages, pensions and even benefit payments - in some cases resulting in defaults on bills.</p>
      <p>"Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today," the lender explained.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket."</p>
      <p>If you've incurred any extra costs due to today's outage, keep hold of any receipts, call logs and invoices which you can use to make a claim once the issue has been resolved.</p>

      <p>The bank said that customers' cards are still working for payments and withdrawals, and that those who need emergency cash can get in touch using the number on the back of their cards.</p>
      <p>You can find your local TSB branch, <a href="https://www.tsb.co.uk/branch-locator/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you need to make a complaint about missing funds, you can get in touch with the bank on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tsb&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch">Twitter</a> or by calling its customer services line on 0345 975 8758 - although bear in mind these lines will be extremely busy for the next few hours, at least.</p>
      <p>"If TSB customers need emergency cash or have any questions they can visit us in branch or contact us via the number on the back of their card," a statement added.</p>
      <p>"Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash."</p>
