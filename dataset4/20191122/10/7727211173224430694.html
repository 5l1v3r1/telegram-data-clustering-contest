      <h1>The underground farm in a Victorian tunnel beneath Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Farm Urban have launched their Greens for Good project with a Kickstarter campaign to help their urban farm to grow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:15:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lisa-rand/" target="_blank">Lisa Rand</a></address>
      <p>Underneath the streets of the Baltic Triangle, green-fingered innovators have created a remarkable subterranean oasis, aimed at providing sustainable, healthy food for the local community.</p>
      <p>Using hydroponics, and taking over a cavernous Victorian tunnel, Liverpool-based social enterprise Farm Urban have created a space for growing leafy greens and herbs whatever the weather.</p>
      <p>The farm, in the basement of the Liverpool Life Sciences UTC school on Parliament Street in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/toxteth">Liverpool 8</a> , has been several years in the making.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Now Farm Urban, founded by Paul Myers and Jens Thomas, has started Greens For Good, a project aimed at "growing greens for taste, not transport" and has launched a new <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greens-for-good/greens-for-good-vertical-farming-with-a-social-mission">Kickstarter campaign</a> to help the project bloom.</p>
      <h3>How the farm works</h3>
      <p>The farm has 240 vertical towers of greens grown hydroponically under controlled conditions in the basement of the Liverpool Life Sciences UTC school.</p>
      <p>Local businesses can receive boxes of freshly grown perishable leafy greens, delivered by bicycle, and can also order a produce pod or even an edible wall.</p>
      <p>Businesses can buy like for like, meaning a school or community centre will also benefit from whatever option the business chooses.</p>

      <p>Farm Urban operations director Jayne Goss told the ECHO: "It's a really exciting project, and we work a lot with students at UTC Life Sciences, who have helped us to try different ways of doing aquaponics and hydroponics."</p>
      <p>"Although there are challenges to growing underground and light is one of the biggest, there are lots of benefits to growing in a controlled space - we can manage temperature, airflow and nutrients.</p>
      <p>"It's actually a very efficient way of growing and you are not subject to the whims of nature.</p>

      <p>Jayne said: "Growing in the urban environment close to where we deliver means that we are growing for taste rather than transport.</p>
      <p>"We grow leafy greens and herbs and focus on growing things that perish quickly, and would normally be transported full of gases to try to keep them fresh.</p>
      <p>"We have had a great response and people are really surprised that it doesn't taste like the stuff you get in bags and there is actually a great variety in terms of the different kinds of leaves out there."</p>

      <p>Jayne, who has a background in education, came on board to help managing directors Paul Myers and Jens Thomas with developing their educational outreach programme.</p>
      <p>Jayne said: "We work a lot with schools across Liverpool. In L8, we have worked with Smithdown Primary and Windsor Primary School with virtual growing projects.</p>
      <p>"It's very hands on. The students will look at the plants growing and adjust light and humidity. We've been exploring what it's like for children to engage digitally.</p>
      <p>"We're hoping to move forward with that and work with the children with some of the programmes we've developed, as well as doing some work with after-school clubs, cooking with some of our ingredients."</p>
      <p>The Farm Urban team also work closely with other organisations in the area, and has installed aquaponics systems, which use fish to help create the nutrients that plants need, at Alder Hey Hospital, University of Liverpool and Ness Gardens in recent years, although Jayne says: "There is still a lot of work to do to make aquaponics commercially viable."</p>

      <p>The urban farm makes use of hydroponics, which feeds nutrients into the water in which plants are grown, and the green-fingered innovators have also been teaming up with social enterprises in the area.</p>
      <p>In the trial phase of the project, Farm Urban have provided Squash on nearby Windsor Street with some of the leafy greens and herbs grown, which they used in some of their workshops and dishes.</p>
      <h3>Plans for the future</h3>
      <p>Jayne said: "We've also had a lot of support from the Baltic triangle and Baltic Creative. We love being in this area, there is a real community feel to the businesses here - it is such an interesting place to be in.</p>
      <p>"In a sense the Baltic was almost a secret for so long before it started to become more widely known and popular. We're still one of the hidden secrets - for now."</p>
      <p>"In 2020, we're really excited that we're going to be looking at expanding our programme, working with more schools to develop resources and materials that helps teachers to facilitate hands-on learning for children around looking at ways of growing differently, and growing sustainably.</p>

      <p>"We're looking forward to getting to the point where we can also deliver to local residents in the vicinity and find ways of getting our fresh produce out there to more and more people.</p>
      <p>"This Kickstarter campaign will really help us reach out to the wider community, and do more collaborative projects in the future.</p>
      <p>We're hoping to be able to open our doors to the public with tours and workshops, as well as short programmes for people to find out more about how they can grow sustainably in their own homes."</p>
