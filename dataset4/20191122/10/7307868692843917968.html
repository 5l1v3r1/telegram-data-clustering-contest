      <p>Miles College has spent this week preparing for their playoff run. The Golden Bears, a No. 7 seed, will face the No. 2 seeded Lenoir-Rhyne in the first round. The game will be played on Saturday, Nov. 23 at noon in Hickory, N.C. </p>
      <p>Miles College head coach Reginald Ruffin also has been named Southern Intercollegiate Athletic (SIAC) Coach of the Year for the third time, adding the award with those won in 2011 and 2015. This season, Miles became the first team in the SIAC Championship Game Era to win back-to-back league titles which was the fourth in his career. The Golden Bears, who led the league in total offense and was second in total defense, have gone 9-2 and set a school record for victories.</p>
      <p>The Golden Bears have done a lot of great things along the road to the conference championship which they secured with a 21-6 victory over Albany State in the title game.

If the Golden Bears can run the football, limit their turnovers and play good defense, they could advance to the next round.</p>
