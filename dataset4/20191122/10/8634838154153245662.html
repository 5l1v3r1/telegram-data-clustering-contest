      <p>Magoha also revealed that the head of state would tour the school and commission in six months. </p>
      <p>"President Kenyatta has today given out Ksh100 million to build a new library in honour of what Kipchoge did for Kenya," Magoha proclaimed.</p>
      <p>However, the tough CS warned government officials not to embezzle the funds as the president would crack the whip on them. </p>
      <p>Kipchoge became the first man to run a 42km marathon in under 2 hours when he clocked 1:59:40 in Vienna Austria on Saturday, October 12, 2019. </p>
      <p>He was feted with the Elder of the Golden Heart Award by Kenyatta on Sunday, October 20, 2019, during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mombasa County.</p>
      <p>The government also handpicked him to support its bid for a seat in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), in New York. </p>
      <p>Kipchoge was also honoured with the twelfth World Marathon Majors Male Champion Award after Nike awarded him <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45882-kipchoge-makes-history-again-worlds-first-ever-golden-award-photos">a historical Gold Album award</a>, which was the <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45974-kipchoge-bags-second-award-one-week">first of its kind</a>. </p>
