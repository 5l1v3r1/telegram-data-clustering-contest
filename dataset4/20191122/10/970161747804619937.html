      <p>Nicole Scherzinger is rumoured to be dating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity star Thom Evans, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/nicole-scherzinger-x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-secretly-dating-weeks-texting-11170165/">after the pair were spotted looking all kinds of cosy</a>.</p>
      <p>But the Pussycat Dolls singer ignored all those romance rumours like a pro as she headed to the Gay Times Honours 500 bash.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old slayed as she rocked up to Magazine London on Thursday night, opting for an off-white, cut-out mini dress for the event.</p>
      <p>She completed the look with all of the jewellery, and a pair of thigh-high beige boots.</p>
      <p>And the Don’t Cha singer debuted her new hairstyle on the red carpet, scooping her hair up into a ponytail to emphasise her snazzy new fringe.</p>
      <p>Nicole was joined on the night by her X Factor: Celebrity co-star Kevin McHale, as well as Love Island’s Megan Barton Hanson, Munroe Bergdorf and Vanessa White.</p>

      <p>Her appearance comes after Thom Evans broke his silence on rumours they are secretly dating – after they were seen together on a romantic night out.</p>

      <p>During a stint on Loose Women alongside his Try Star bandmates, the rugby player <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-gets-flustered-nicole-scherzinger-dating-rumours-11195402/">did absolutely nothing to discourage the rumour mill</a>.</p>
      <p>In fact, the 34-year-old got very flustered when questioned about their ‘relationship’.</p>
      <p>‘Nicole is lovely and you know, I… But I’ve been concentrating on the bromance… And getting to the final,’ the 34-year-old told the panel who couldn’t contain their giggles over his denial.</p>
      <p>‘Who wouldn’t want to date Nicole? She’s lovely and, ermmmm…’</p>

      <p>Smooth, hun.</p>
      <p>An insider recently claimed Thom was completely smitten with Nicole, and plucked up the courage to ask her out this week.</p>
      <p>‘Thom is completely Nicole’s type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world,’ an insider claimed to The Sun.</p>
      <p>‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>

      <p>‘And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner.’</p>
