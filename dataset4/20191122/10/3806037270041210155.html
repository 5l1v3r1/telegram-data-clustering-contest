      <h1>'Fortnite' Is Hosting Its Inaugural Fishing Tournament This Weekend</h1>
      <h2>Time to put down the guns.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:55:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Yeung</a></address>
      <p>After adding a new fishing feature to its Chapter 2 offerings, the massively popular battle royale game <a href="https://hypebeast.com/search?s=fortnite"><i>Fortnite</i></a> is now hosting its first-ever fishing tournament this weekend.</p>
      <p>Starting on November 22, players can take part in a special event named “Triggerfish Presents: Fortnite Fishing Frenzy,” which pits gamers against each other within their regions in a race to catch the most amount of fish in a single match. The winner will earn the title Top Angler, whilst other titles such as Small Fry Champion, Floppers Champion, and Slurpfish Champion will be awarded to those catching the most amount of the corresponding species. The top regional category winner will even be awarded a real engraved Llama Trophy.</p>
      <p>Aside from titles, the event will get an accompanying skin aptly named Triggerfish, and those who manage to catch the Mythic Goldfish will be awarded the Bottom Dweller Pickaxe. For those who don’t manage to earn any of the titles or rewards, fret not either — Epic will reward any player who uses the fishing rod during the event period with a Play to Win spray.</p>
      <p>The inaugural <i>Fortnite</i> fishing tournament will commence November 22 and conclude November 24.</p>
