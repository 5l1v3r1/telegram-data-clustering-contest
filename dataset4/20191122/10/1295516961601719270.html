      <p>Unfortunately, Whovians won’t be able to get their festive dose of <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a></i> for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/no-doctor-who-special-christmas-20917725">The Mirror</a>, while there won’t be a Christmas special yet again, the highly anticipated 12th series of the show is set to begin with a two-parter on New Year's Day -- the first of which has been described as one of the most ambitious things ever attempted on <i>Doctor Who</i>.</p>
