      <h1>Civilization VI on PS4 and Xbox One Works, It's Fine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:00:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>I’m not here <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/10/27/civilization-vi-the-kotaku-review">to review <i>Civilization VI </i>again</a>, or <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/02/11/civilization-vi-gathering-storm-the-kotaku-review">its two expansions</a>. I’ve done that already. What I am here today to tell you is that all that stuff is now available on PS4 and Xbox One, and against my best instincts and predictions, it’s absolutely fine.</p>
      <p>Prior to playing, <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2018/11/16/civilization-vi-runs-well-on-switch-but-is-missing-some-features">and as someone who hadn’t tried the already-out Switch version of this game</a>, I’d have thought this premise insane. <i>Civilization </i>has been tried on consoles before, with <i>Revolution</i>, which couldn’t really capture the full experience. And this is a fairly weighty PC strategy game, especially when you throw in all the extra content and systems included with the expansions, so the prospect of getting through all that on a controller seemed torturous.</p>
      <p><i>Civ VI’s </i>interface works surprisingly well on console, though, with unit controls relegated to the d-pad and more high-level stuff available by hitting the triggers. The actual layout of everything – like, where the buttons actually <i>are</i> – sticks pretty close to the PC version, which made getting around easy, I just had to remember to move the sticks instead of a mouse.</p>
      <p>I’ve skipped <i>Civ VI</i> on Switch mostly because of its lack of content. Without its two game-defining expansions available, which for me as a PC player have redefined the <i>Civ VI</i> experience, I didn’t have much interest.. The PS4 and Xbox One have both expansions available right away, making them a much more serious proposition, if also a more expensive one, since for some reason the base game is sold separately from a bundle that includes both expansions (really, this game is over three years old, they should have just put everything in one box).</p>
      <p>I played on a standard PS4, and found the whole thing largely pleasant. It did get a bit slow in places, especially when the AI is crunching gears moving its units around, but for the most part I found playing <i>Civilization VI</i> on my couch to be exactly the same as playing it at my desk.</p>
      <p>A big reason the whole thing has ported so seamlessly is I think the ease with which the menus and interface have made the jump. Like I said, the console versions haven’t really had to change anything about how you play the game, how the menus work or how the icons are laid out. I don’t know if that’s intentional – that the original PC version was designed with later console ports in mind – or if it’s just a happy coincidence, but it’s hard to fault a port when it retains so much of what made the original great.</p>
