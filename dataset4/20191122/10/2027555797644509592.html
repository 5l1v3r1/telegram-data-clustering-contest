      <h1>'Sena won't support BJP even if offered Indra's throne'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:33:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Shiv Sena won't side with the BJP even if offered Lord Indra's throne, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Talking to reporters, Raut reiterated that his party will get the Maharashtra CM's post when the three-party alliance with Congress and NCP assumes power.</p>
      <p>"The time for offers has ended," Raut said, when asked about reports that the BJP had agreed to share the CM's post with the Sena.</p>
      <p>"People of Maharashtra want Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to become the CM," he said.</p>
      <p>Asked if the three non-BJP parties would meet the state governor on Friday itself, Raut quipped, "Why meet the governor when the President's rule is in place".Â </p>
