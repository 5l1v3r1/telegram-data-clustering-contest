      <h1>Chris Evans Defends Getting Political, Says He ‘Never Felt Limited Or Handcuffed’ By Captain America Role</h1>

      <p>Chris Evans is one of many celebrities to share his political views on social media, and even visited Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., earlier this year as part of <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/438704/chris-evans-shares-details-of-his-secret-new-political-project-a-starting-point/">an upcoming project</a> intended to bridge America’s political divide between left and right.</p>
      <p>The erstwhile Captain America has also pulled no punches in his criticism of the Trump administration on Twitter, which has increased in recent months.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/chris-evans-twitter-politics-captain-america-marvel-173352173.html"><i>Yahoo! Entertainment</i></a>, the “Avengers” star addressed speculation that the increasingly political nature of his tweets is connected with his recent departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

      <p>“I did it during Cap, too; it wasn’t like I waited until that run was over,” Evans said of broadcasting his political views on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I was doing it while we were filming those movies.”</p>
      <p>Evans also stated that he was never told to tone it down, even when playing arguably America’s most iconic superhero.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never felt limited or handcuffed by the roles I play or the studios I worked for,” Evans continued. “I never in my life had a studio tell me to watch what I’m saying.”</p>

      <p>However, Evans did admit that navigating the intersection between show-business celebrity and politics can be “tricky” when you run the risk of alienating those who don’t share the same views.</p>
      <p>“We live in an industry that’s basically about ticket sales, and you understand a downstream impact could hurt that,” he explained. “But sometimes things matter just too much.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, as his Twitter followers are well aware, Evans isn’t all about politics, and also spends a lot of time tweeting videos and photos of his beloved rescue dog, Dodger.</p>
      <p>“Who doesn’t love the dog?” he quipped. “You gotta balance it, you know what I mean? I get political, but I also got a great dog!”</p>
