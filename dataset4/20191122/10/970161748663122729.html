      <p>Speculation is rife that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-walking-dead/">The Walking Dead</a> may come to an abrupt end after its twelfth season.</p>
      <p>The zombie apocalypse drama is currently airing its tenth season, which star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/the-walking-dead-season-10-norman-reedus-reveals-filming-has-wrapped-as-daryl-and-carol-take-a-blood-splattered-selfie-11192508/">Norman Reedus confirmed has now wrapped filming</a>.</p>
      <p>Rumours that the show may be nearing its final end comes after its original source material, the comic book of the same name,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/03/walking-dead-comics-come-end-robert-kirkman-confirms-surprise-death-10106252/"> came to its conclusion after running for over 16 years</a>.</p>
      <p>According to gossip site <a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/walking-dead-ending-after-season-12/">We Got This Covered,</a> sources at the programme’s home channel AMC suggest that it could be less than two years before the blockbuster dystopian show says goodbye for good.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed that the channel will then shift its focus onto the growing number of spin-offs; from Fear The Walking Dead to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/20/walking-dead-rick-grimes-movies-will-now-released-cinemas-10430358/">Rick Grimes movies starring Andrew Lincoln</a>.</p>
      <p>But developments on the TV show itself do actually hint that and endgame, if not necessarily in play right now, is indeed being set up with the recent introduction of The Commonwealth, who played a massive part in the ending of the comics.</p>

      <p>The society boasts a massive 50,000 survivors who are all placed in a caste system based on who they were before the apocalypse, so the rich become rich and the poor become poor.</p>

      <p>The good news is, however, is that fans won’t have to worry about the show ending just yet, as they still have a way to go before they get to witness the end of the current season. Things do seem to be coming to a head, however.</p>
      <p>Samantha Morton was the biggest new arrival for the new instalment as Alpha, the creepy leader of the Whisperers, a band of apocalypse survivors who camouflage themselves under the skin of dead walkers.</p>
      <p>Many fans have a feeling, however, that the Big Bad<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/walking-dead-season-10-alpha-going-meet-savage-end-hands-negan-11002043/"> may meet her end at the hands of an even bigger bad – Negan himself</a>.</p>
      <p>There was a game-changing twist at the end of the most recent episode as a huge hero was killed off – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/walking-dead-season-10-siddiq-dead-avi-nash-reaction-11173925/">the star behind the twist has finally broken their silence</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, we know The Walking Dead loves throwing twists and turns at the audience, so<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/walking-dead-season-10-siddiq-dead-avi-nash-reaction-11173925/"> we have several questions as to what this twist means</a> as we approach the endgame of season 10.</p>
