      <p>Performance specialist <a href="https://mcchip-dkr.com/en/">McChip-DKR</a> is now offering a choice of three software upgrades that will brutally enhance the output of the BMW M2 Competition. If you feel that the 6-cylinder <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/05/photo-comparison-bmw-m2-cs-vs-m2-competition/">S55-powered M2 Competition</a> is not potent enough to suit your taste, you might consider the new chip tuning package from McChip-DKR.</p>
      <p>The entry-level Stage 1 power kit costs €1,499 ($1,663) and increases the output of the M2 Competition from 410 PS (405 hp) up to 530 PS (522 hp). The torque goes up to 680 Nm (502 lb-ft) from the standard 550 Nm (406 lb-ft). The top speed increases to 310 km/h (193 mph), which is an extra 30 km/h (19 mph) over the standard M2 Competition.</p>

      <p>Next in line is the Stage 2, which uses a more targeted software engine remap and a Capristo downpipe to increase the power by 15 PS compared to Stage 1. Thus, it offers a peak output of 545 PS (537 hp), while the torque goes up to 700 Nm (516 lb-ft). The top speed reaches 310 km/h (193 mph) and probably the 0-100 km/h (0-60 mph) acceleration will take less than for Stage 1. To have it, you’ll have to spend €3,039 ($3,371).</p>

      <p>Last, but not least, the icing on the cake is the Stage 3 chip tuning package which turns the M2 Competition into a brute. The maximum output increases up to 600 PS (592 hp), which is mind-blowing for a 6-cylinder engine and puts it on par with <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/17/test-drive-bmw-m850i-gran-coupe-four-is-better-than-two/">V8-powered BMW M models</a>.</p>
      <p>As well, the peak output goes up to 750 Nm (533 lb-ft), meaning that the car has enough resources to hit the first 100 km/h (60 mph) in probably less than 4 seconds. The top speed is calculated at 315 km/h (196 mph). If you are planning to purchase this ultimate chip tuning package, prepare to spend a staggering €8,679 ($9,626).</p>
