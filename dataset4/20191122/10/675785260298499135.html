      <h2>A man who shared an open letter complaining about the noise his next door neighbour's young child makes has come under fire from stunned people on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:03:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>Becoming a parent isn't always a walk in the park.</p>
      <p>While it's a joyous occasion welcoming a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> into the world, it can also be an incredibly stressful and tiring time - and it seems it's not just the new mum and dad who are left feeling drained by the experience.</p>
      <p>The childless neighbour of a couple with a toddler has penned an open letter to the family, criticising them for the amount of noise their little one made as a baby.</p>
      <p>Published in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/16/a-letter-to-our-neighbours-with-a-baby?CMP=fb_gu&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR273eQ4JcEiSpUroN36h_c1qjcjQ3ztQVTEsvvCaFPIUI-ofaAQsEeqMY4#Echobox=1573896937">The Guardian,</a> the piece was described as "the letter you always wanted to write" and has come under fire from social media users who thought the writer was being incredibly "selfish".</p>

      <p>In the letter, the unnamed man explains how he and his wife are childless "through choice" and says they have never judged anyone's decision to become <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parents.</a></p>
      <p>However their patience was "tested" when they moved in next door to a couple expecting a little girl.</p>
      <p>"Now my wife and I have some experience of what it would be like to be a new parents," he writes. "We know how it feels to be woken several times a night by what, at that hour, has the effect on the nerves of a fire alarm.</p>
      <p>"Her protracted wailing cost us dozens of hours of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sleep">sleep</a> at a time when our careers were stressful and demanding. It placed an unwelcome strain on our own relationship and soured our enjoyment of our new home."</p>
      <p>The writer goes on to complain that in three years the parents never once "apologised" for the noise or tried to "mitigate" it by moving the child to another room.</p>
      <p>He concedes that parenting is "difficult and frustrating" but this does little to resolve the situation.</p>
      <p>"As callous as this may sound," he adds, "The world doesn't stop just because you've had a child. The people around you have their own lives to cope with, their own problems that they don't inflict on others. To expect them to share your discomfort is deeply selfish."</p>
      <p>The letter ends with the man revealing that the couple are going to have a second baby and he's hoping this one will be quieter.</p>
      <p>People on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> were appalled by the man's words and branded him "entitled".</p>
      <p>One user commented: "What entitled BS is this? If it was so bad why not seek friendly communication rather than expecting the new parents to keep you at the forefront of their minds?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "Blows my mind this type of selfishness, what happened to compassion, empathy and understanding.</p>
      <p>"Buy a detached house from the proceeds of your highly stressful job if you don't want disturbance."</p>
      <p>A third added: "God I hope that kid grows into a popular teenage and throws the most raucous parties!"</p>
      <p>A different user replied: "Buy some ear plugs and get over yourselves."</p>
      <p>However not everyone thought the writer was in the wrong.</p>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "They chose to have the child. Inflicting your child on someone else is very selfish."</p>
