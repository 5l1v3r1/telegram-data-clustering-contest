      <p>The recent opening of the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/video_lets_take_a_tour_of_londons_pop_up_pokemon_center_shall_we">Pokémon Center London</a> was something of a mixed bag; while it was great to have a dedicated (if temporary) store in the UK for <b>Pokémon</b> goods, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/pokemon_center_london_closes_entry_queue_9_hours_early_due_to_ridiculously_high_demand">the queues</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/pokemon_center_london_goes_from_bad_to_worse_products_could_sell_out_before_closure">lack of stock</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/scalpers_strike_as_demand_for_pokemon_center_london_merchandise_skyrockets">inevitable flood of scalpers</a> meant that for some, the experience wasn't <i>quite</i> as positive as it possibly could have been.</p>
      <p>Still, with 30,000 visitors during its four-week opening period, it clearly went well enough for The Pokémon Company to have a second stab at the concept, as it has just been announced that the pop-up shop will return to London during the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/cor_blimey_guvnor_the_pokemon_world_championships_are_headed_to_london_in_2020">2020 Pokémon World Championships</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking place in London next summer at a venue which has not yet been announced, the Pokémon World Championships is the "premier tournament for Pokémon video games and the Pokémon Trading Card Game", and the pop-up store will be open for the duration of the event.</p>
      <p>Will you be attending, and – more importantly – will you be taking plenty of cash with you?</p>
