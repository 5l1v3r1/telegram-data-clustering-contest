      <h1>What Does Oakland Think of Kamala Harris Now?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:00:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Medina</a></address>
      <p>OAKLAND, Calif. — When Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/kamala-harris.html?module=inline">Kamala Harris</a> announced her presidential campaign on the steps of City Hall <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-rally-2020.html?module=inline">here in January</a>, tens of thousands of people showed up, optimistically cheering for a person they believed could be the first woman — the first black woman — in the White House.</p>
      <p>“It was like a party where we all wanted to be,” said Louise Bailey, 77, a retired nursing administrator who has lived in Oakland for decades. “I don’t know why it doesn’t feel like that anymore. I wish I knew why.”</p>
      <p>Even here, where some affectionately call her an Oakland girl, the celebratory feel of the campaign has evaporated in the last 10 months. Now, Ms. Harris lags in the polls, trailing in fourth place even in her home state of California, where many have begun to openly wonder when she should drop out of the race.</p>
      <p>Implicitly and explicitly, Ms. Harris is counting on the support of African-American women to win the Democratic nomination.</p>
      <p>But in the city where she began her legal career, there is no across the board support from black women. What was once enthusiasm and optimism has now mostly faded to ambivalence or cynicism.</p>
      <p>Many of them ask the same question that Ms. Harris posed onstage Wednesday night: “Where you been? And what are you going to do?”</p>
      <p>Robyn Hurt, an Oakland schoolteacher, said she’s long been skeptical of Ms. Harris’s record as a prosecutor, asking: Did she do enough to lower the rate of incarceration for African-American men? Did she push hard enough for criminal justice reform?</p>
      <p>“She could have used her job to create more programs, to do more for our community, so, no, I’m not her biggest fan,” Ms. Hurt, 30, said. “She’s saying all the right things tonight, though.”</p>
      <p>At a debate watch party on Wednesday night sponsored by several African-American community groups, many of the dozens of people crowded into the room were filled with anxious skepticism. They worried that candidates were simply saying “what they know we want to hear,” as many put it. They were most eager to hear what each of the presidential hopefuls would do to improve the economy, especially on housing and homelessness, topics that were barely touched on in the two hour debate.</p>
      <p>Le’Ana Powell, a 35-year-old Oakland native, said that she was relieved to see Ms. Harris willing to aggressively make the case for herself on the debate stage Wednesday, in part by making clear arguments about what black families in America are facing these days.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got these people up there talking about college debt, but that’s not the problem,” Ms. Powell said. “The problem is African-Americans aren’t getting paid as much. She’s the only one willing to say that. She’s not shying away from the real stuff, she’s coming for it. She’s being herself and I’m loving it.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Harris’s experience as a prosecutor is a central part of her campaign; after the debate Wednesday, she once again argued that she had done more for criminal justice reform than any other candidate. But here, doubts often center on what she did as district attorney and attorney general, when she sought to combat truancy by punishing parents whose children regularly missed school.</p>
      <p>“She is the real deal and she aligns with many things I believe, but I do struggle with some of her past,” said Danielle Driver-Bellino, 33, who works as a black infant health care specialist in Oakland. Still, Ms. Driver-Bellino said, Ms. Harris is one of a handful of candidates she is still considering voting for. “It’s still so early.”</p>
      <p>Like so many other black women in Oakland, a part of Ms. Driver-Bellino simply wants to see a woman of color succeed on the national stage. But just behind that desire comes a nagging question: Can a woman of color really win in this country? And for the college-educated professional women here in their 30s and beyond, the reluctant conclusion seemed to be almost unanimous: No.</p>
      <p>“I like the younger voters, the folks who are not the norm,” said Dian Johnson Harrison, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California who lives in Oakland. “The country is in a weird place for people of color.”</p>
      <p>“Weird is one way of saying it,” her friend Carole Watson, 74, chimed in.</p>
      <p>“There’s going to be people who say she can’t do it, she can’t be president,” Ms. Harrison continued. “I don’t know those people and it should not be that way, but that’s the reality.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Harris had not yet spoken much during the debate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-harris-debate.html?module=inline">when she began to lace into Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii</a>, who had previously gone after Ms. Harris’s record as a prosecutor.</p>
      <p>“Go on girl, get it,” one woman shouted at the large screen at the front of the room.</p>
      <p>Many here believed that Ms. Harris was at last making her own policy stances clear Wednesday, something they welcomed with relief.</p>
      <p>“I want to be hearing more detail from her, like what does she really think? And what are her plans? I love <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/democratic-candidates-atlanta.html?module=inline">Elizabeth Warren</a> because she’s been so straightforward,” said Shanice Wolcott, 46, a social worker. “She does seem a lot less defensive, maybe because she’s an underdog now and maybe she understands that we can’t just have a bunch of infighting up there.”</p>
      <p>Perhaps, suggested Gina Tomlin, a 50-year-old technology consultant, Ms. Harris has been wary of unfairly being perceived as an “angry black woman.”</p>
      <p>“That perception is very real and very worrisome,” Ms. Tomlin said. “She has been humbled by the struggle she’s had on the national arena, because here she had nothing but success. But the rest of the country isn’t our California bubble. I think she’s the most intelligent person up there, but she cannot win in this climate that we’re in.”</p>
      <p>But, Ms. Tomlin emphasized, as long as she stayed in the race, Ms. Harris could count on her vote.</p>
      <p>After the televised debate ended, a moderator led a discussion among the several dozen people who were interested in giving their own postgame analysis. He ended with a simple question: “Did we really learn anything new tonight?”</p>
      <p>“No,” the room groaned in unison.</p>
      <p>And for all the cheering for Ms. Harris, the conversation once again turned to a blunt assessment of race.</p>
      <p>“The top four will be Warren, Sanders, Biden and Harris — but she is not going to win,” said Aziza Jackson, 32, a freelance writer. “They need that white woman vote, let’s be honest. And they’re going to say, in Iowa, in Ohio, those places: Can’t we just get someone white?”</p>
      <p>Many in the room nodded, their smiles turning to grimaces.</p>
