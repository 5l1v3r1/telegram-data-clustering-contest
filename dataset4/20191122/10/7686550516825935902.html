      <p>
        <b>UPDATE: TSB has said the issue is resolved and all the affected payments have now been made to and from customer accounts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is understood the error was caused by a processing delay.</p>
      <p>A technical glitch at TSB bank has left scores of customers who expected payments today without the funds in their accounts.</p>
      <p>The bank has said it is "working to process" payments after many customers woke up this morning to discover they were without cash.</p>
      <p>Furious account holders have complained on Twitter that they have been unable to pay rent, buy food or afford transport to and from work.</p>
      <p>One woman wrote: "I really need my money I have rent to pay, my son has a hospital appointment and i cant reschedule it for another 5 months! This has really destroyed me because now I've no food for either me or my son and no gas or nothing..."</p>

      <p>Another said: " <a href="https://twitter.com/TSB">@TSB</a> what's happening, I've got 3p in my bank until I get paid and if it weren't for getting a lift to work I wouldn't be able to get there, no money to get food or anything still."</p>
      <p>A third person added: "Whereâ€™s our money this is ridiculous we have bills rent and children to feed."</p>

      <p>The bank has vowed to provide emergency cash to those in need while it works to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the company said: "Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out-of-pocket."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"If TSB customers need emergency cash contact us via the number on the back of their card. Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash."</p>
      <p>TSB has not confirmed how many people are affected or when the delay will be resolved.</p>
      <p>The technical problem is not the company's first.</p>
      <p>In April 2018, an IT crisis left 1.9 million customers unable to bank online.</p>
