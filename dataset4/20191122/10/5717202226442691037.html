      <h1>Graham Potter comments on Leeds loanee Ben White’s future</h1>

        <b>Graham Potter has suggested, <a href="https://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/18052869.potter-ready-let-ben-white-loan-runs-course-leeds/">in comments reported by The Argus</a>, that he would have been interested in signing Ben White had he stayed at Swansea City this season, before confirming that the centre-back will remain with Leeds United until the summer.</b>

      <p>White has been a revelation at Elland Road. It looked to be a gamble from Marcelo Bielsa to sign the 22-year-old, particularly with Pontus Jansson leaving shortly after. But White has alleviated any concerns in style.</p>

      <p>The centre-back has arguably been Leeds’s best player so far this season. And that had left plenty of Whites supporters fearing that Brighton may decide to recall him in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/leeds-united-fans-can-relax-no-chance-brighton-will-recall-ben-white-january-transfer-window-997135">The Yorkshire Evening Post recently reported</a> that his premature exit was all but impossible due to the number of games he has played.</p>

      <p>And Potter has now insisted that White will be staying at Elland Road as he explained how he has been a fan of the youngster since before taking the Seagulls job.</p>
      <p>“He is a player we like a lot,” he said, <a href="https://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/18052869.potter-ready-let-ben-white-loan-runs-course-leeds/">as reported by the Argus</a>. “We were aware of him when I was at Swansea.</p>
      <p>“We were probably one of the clubs who would have tried to get him on loan if we were still there.”</p>
      <p>“He is at Leeds now. He is on loan. You let that run and settle down at the end of the season. He is at Leeds and doing a good job there,” he went on to add.</p>
      <h3>Short-term boost for Leeds</h3>
      <p>It is obviously a shame for Leeds that White’s long-term future looks to lie away from Yorkshire. But it is a big boost for this season that he is set to be around for the entire year.</p>
      <p>Bielsa’s men boast the best defensive record in the Championship this term. And White is the one defender who has played every minute so far.</p>
