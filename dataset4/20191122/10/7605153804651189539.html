        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 22 – A section of Tatu City clients are still waiting for approval from the Kiambu County government to proceed with building plans, six months  after the government declared Tatu city a Special planning Area.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The nod by the government was expected to cut planning and construction approval bureaucracy for homeowners and developers and fast track the city as a private sector development.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Head of Residential Sales at Tatu City Beatrice Njeri says the mixed-use development is still pushing the county for permission to proceed with the projects even as more residential homes come up.</p>
      <p>“We are working continuously with the Kiambu County Government to ensure that we get approvals for our clients,” Njeri said.</p>
      <p>“Very soon the services will be available from within Tatu City where the clients will get their approvals where we currently have over 6000 homes within Tatu City,” she adds.</p>
      <p>Early this year, Tatu City said delay caused by the County Government in approving their building projects was halting the progress of the plant.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Tatu City was awarded Special Economic Zone status, giving businesses in the zone benefits such as low corporate taxes and zero import duties.</p>
      <p>The project was launched in November 2015 and has so far attracted numerous Kenyan, regional and multinational companies.</p>
      <p>The projected is seated on a 5000-acre land filled with homes, schools, offices, medical clinic areas that are yet to be constructed and more than one industrial park expected to host factories.</p>
      <p>Kijani Ridge, which will host many of the homes, sits on 250 acres with a total of 439 individually serviced plots.</p>
      <p>The two schools in the area,  Nova Pioneer, which offers local curriculum and Crawford School that is offering British curriculum have already opened shop in the area.</p>
      <p>Other companies in Tatu Industrial Park include Unilever, Chandaria Industries, Dormans, Coopers K-Brands, Africa Logistics Properties, Kim-Fay, Davis &amp; Shirtliff, Tianlong, Parma Medical, Stecol Corporation, Kenstar, Maxam, Monwalk, Freight Forwarders Kenya, Gallagher, Friendship Containers, Bakpharm and Shenzhen Star, among others.</p>
      <p>“This is a 15-20-year project and it’s a legacy we are going to leave here, currently we are 20 percent complete, a clear indication that there is still a lot more to be done,” said Tatu City Commercial Sales Manager Tito Oduk.</p>
