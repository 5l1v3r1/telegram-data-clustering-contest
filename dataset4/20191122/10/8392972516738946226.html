      <p>Others admitted they had voted for her to do the trial after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-fans-brand-jacqueline-and-nadine-snakes-as-they-refuse-to-do-challenge/">she refused to participate in a challenge</a> last night.</p>
      <p>The campmates had to pick two stars to join newbies <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-already-convinced-andy-whyment-will-win/">Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi as Outlaws in the Jungle Jailhouse</a>.</p>

      <p>One person said: "Don’t think Jacqueline and Nadine refusing is gonna do them any good is it one of them is gonna get voted."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Just used all my votes for Jaqueline &amp; Nadine. You go on this show to take part not spit your dummies out and refuse to be apart of the experience."</p>
