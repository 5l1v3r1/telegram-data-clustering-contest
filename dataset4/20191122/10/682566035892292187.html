      <p>Brisbane - <b>Pakistan</b> were left to rue a basic error from 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah as <b>Australia</b> opener <b>David Warner</b> plundered the visitors' attack with a brilliant 151 not out on the second day of the first Test at the Gabba on Friday.</p>
      <p>Australia finished the day on 312 for the loss of just one wicket, 72 runs ahead of Pakistan's first innings total of 240 and already in the driving seat.</p>
      <p>Marnus Labuschagne was alongside Warner on 55, with the only wicket to fall that of Joe Burns, who made 97 before sweeping a Yasir Shah (1-101) delivery onto his stumps.</p>
      <p>Warner scored his first Test century since a year-long ban for ball-tampering, but only after a huge let-off when he was caught behind off a Naseem no-ball.</p>
      <p>The mercurial opener was on 56 at the time, and he then survived a near run-out on 93 before ending a century drought stretching back nearly two years.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, who managed just 95 runs in 10 innings during this year's Ashes series against England, reached his 22nd Test ton when he turned Yasir around the corner for a single in the second over after tea.</p>
      <p>Before the Ashes, he spent a year in the wilderness over the ball-tampering scandal and there were questions as to whether his days as an automatic choice at the top of the order were over.</p>
      <p>However, in home conditions and against an attack that struggled for sideways movement, Warner was in imperious form as he brought up his fourth Test century at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>"For me it's about going out there and backing my ability," he said, insisting he never felt any pressure about his place in the side.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day you get selected or you don't get selected and you've just got to accept that."</p>
      <p>In the second last over of the day, Warner had another close shave when he was beaten by an Imran Khan delivery that brushed the off stump without disturbing the bails.</p>
      <p>"Today I was on the receiving end of a bit of luck, which is what you need in a game - over there (in England) I didn't get any luck at all," he said.</p>
      <p>Naseem looked impressive on debut and regularly bowled at over 145 kilometres per hour, but he was guilty of overstepping the mark on a number of occasions, despite not being called by the umpire.</p>
      <p>In the second over after lunch, he enticed an expansive drive from Warner, who nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan.</p>
      <p>But Warner had barely left the crease when he was called back after TV umpire Michael Gough picked up that Naseem had again misplaced his front foot.</p>
      <p>Naseem looked like he belonged on the big stage with a number of bristling spells before leaving the field late in the day with an apparent leg injury.</p>
      <p>"He won't get a harder Test debut, bowling at the Gabba," Warner said.</p>
      <p>"He kept his speed up the whole day - he charged in all day, there's a (future) superstar there."</p>
      <p>The lack of movement meant Warner and Burns were able to play Naseem with relative ease, although he smashed Burns on the elbow two balls before the lunch break.</p>
