      <p>A magistrate’s son who robbed a schoolboy at knifepoint has avoided a prison sentence after a judge heard his behaviour had put his parents ‘through hell’.</p>
      <p>Mahtarr Njie-Morgan, 18, and friend Kieran Garricks-Ferguson took his young victim’s £420 designer jacket in the robbery in Jubilee Park in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>Nije-Morgan’s defence lawyer told Warwick Crown Court yesterday: ‘The offence is now two years and three months ago. This period of offending is now firmly behind him.</p>
      <p>‘His father is a lay magistrate in Birmingham. He has described how his son has put him and his mother through hell, but he was anxious for me to know how he believes his son has turned his life around and is a different young man.’</p>
      <p>Garricks-Ferguson grabbed the victim, who was with a friend, in a headlock and threw him to the ground, causing him to hit his head.</p>

      <p>He then picked him up off the floor and demanded the gilet as Nije-Morgan asked ‘shall I get it out?’</p>
      <p>They then turned on the victim’s friend who refused to hand over his Gilet. Nije-Morgan repeated the question then passed the Stanley knife to Garricks-Ferguson.</p>

      <p>They then fled when two dogs ran over to them as they attacked the boys.</p>
      <p>Nije-Morgan was caught in August 2017 after being spotted on CCTV wearing the gilet which was found at his home in Acocks Green, Birmingham.</p>
      <p>They denied the allegation, meaning the case was stretched out but finally admitted their guilty on the first day of their trial.</p>
      <p>Despite having previous convictions for robbery and possession of a knife at school, Nije-Morgan a received 22-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months. Garricks-Ferguson had no previous convictions and received the same sentence.</p>

      <p>Judge Peter Cooke told them: ‘The two of you subjected a lad of only 14 to the most horrible ordeal because you had your eye on his gilet.</p>
      <p>‘It was an expensive item, but that is not the point. The significance of the offence is what you put him through in your determination to steal it. It was a truly horrible offence.</p>
      <p>‘Your case presents me with a real dilemma. We have the gravity of the offence, and that neither of you had the sense and courage to admit it until a late stage.</p>
      <p>‘But we also have the quite striking personal mitigation for the two of you of two years not only not re-offending, but reshaping your lives into young men your parents can be proud of.</p>

      <p>‘The public interest at this juncture would not be served by taking two young students and turning them into two young prisoners for what they did at the age of 16.’</p>
