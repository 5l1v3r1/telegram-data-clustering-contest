      <h1>Kaneshie and its environs flooded</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:58:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author">Joyce Danso, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - Kaneshie and its environs were flooded following a down pour on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Areas badly hit by the floods include the Obetsebi-Lamptey roundabouts, First Light, Kaneshie Footbridge, Pambrom and parts of Abossey Okai. Many shops along the Kaneshie highway also had their good submerged in the rain water.</p>
      <p>Some drivers found it difficult to drive through the floods and drove slowly and with this some even got stuck in the middle of the road.</p>
      <p>Drivers had to drive through seeking safe spots for passengers to alight.</p>
      <p>Passengers were also seen stranded as they were unable to cross over to various destinations.</p>
      <p>Some youth also cashed in on the situation as they ferried both the young and old on their back in the bid to help them board vehicles to their various destination.</p>
      <p>The men charged between GH¢ 1.00 and GH¢2.00 before one was transported for the short distance.</p>
      <p>Akosua Ataa told the Ghana News Agency that she was to alight at the Kaneshie Roundabout to transact business in a bank but she was taken to the Kaneshie market because the various bus stops were all flooded.</p>
      <p>She said she had to spend more than one hour before the driver of her bus could find a safe place for her to alight.</p>
      <p>Some market women that the GNA spoke with said the flood had carried along some of their goods and were unable to retrieve them.</p>
      <p>They attributed the floods not only to choked drains but also to the ongoing construction work in the area.</p>
