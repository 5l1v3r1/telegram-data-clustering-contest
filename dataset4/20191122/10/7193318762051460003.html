      <p>An investment fund that owns nearly 10% of Gulfport stock continues to spar with the Oklahoma City-based oil and natural gas exploration and production company over how it is being run.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Firefly Value Partners took its beef with the company public for the second time in less than a year.</p>
      <p>This time, Firefly published a letter that accuses Gulport’s leaders of refusing to engage in talks about potential new board members and about other changes Firefly executives believe are needed to improve the operator’s value to shareholders.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Gulfport, however, disputes that characterization, noting that top Gulfport and Firefly executives discussed the fund’s concerns as recently as earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The fund, which states it is Gulfport’s largest active shareholder, also is demanding a seat on the company’s board as a shareholder representative.</p>
      <p>“We have had a meaningful investment in Gulfport since 2013. Over the past six years, two things have remained constant: Gulfport has had a first-rate asset in the Utica Shale, and Gulfport’s board of directors has seemingly done its best to prevent the full value of this asset from accruing to shareholders,” Firefly’s letter states.</p>
      <p>Firefly first took its frustrations with the company public in late 2018. Then, it was pushing the natural gas producer to realign its executive compensation and to implement an expanded share buyback program.</p>
      <p>This week, Gulfport officials announced they are suspending a share buyback program started after the battle with Firefly nearly a year ago.</p>
      <p>Gulfport officials also said they completed a process to reduce staff by 13%, that two board members were resigning and that the company's chairman won’t stand for re-election next year.</p>
      <p>Firefly’s letter this week also states the fund proposes to collaborate with Gulfport to select suitable replacements, but hasn’t had any success.</p>
      <p>Gulfport’s response, which the spokesman provided via email, is that the company is willing to consider any candidates who apply and meet Gulfport’s requirements for skillset, diversity and experience.</p>
      <p>“While we disagree with Firefly’s demands for additional share repurchases at this time, we have repeatedly invited them to provide criteria and/or resumes for qualified new director candidates, which they have declined to do,” the spokesman’s statement read.</p>
      <p>Firefly’s letter noted the firm finds it “astounding” that Gulfport won’t acknowledge a need for large shareholder representation on its board of directors.</p>
      <p>“Almost a year has passed since Firefly first engaged with the board,” Thursday’s letter stated. “Unfortunately, things have not improved.</p>
      <p>“The company has not even come close to fulfilling its commitments to urgently pursue non-core asset sales and return cash proceeds to shareholders.”</p>
      <p>Finally, Firefly’s letter indicated the fund’s decision to take this latest dispute public was made reluctantly.</p>
      <p>“We believe in the value of the company. Gulfport has great assets and great people,” it stated.</p>
      <p>And it warned Firefly will nominate its own candidates to the board, if necessary.</p>
      <p>“Change is needed, and we will pursue any and all options available to us,” it concluded.</p>
      <p>The Gulfport spokesman’s statement, meanwhile, asserted the company's board and executive team value dialogue with shareholders.</p>
      <p>“Our announced initiatives, including the suspension of our share repurchase program and our continued focus on accretive debt repurchases, reflect the collective input from many of our large stakeholders,” it read.</p>
      <p>“We are confident that these efforts will drive shareholder value.”</p>
      <p>Gulfport shares slipped 6 cents, or 2.8%, Thursday to close at $2.66 on the Nasdaq.</p>
