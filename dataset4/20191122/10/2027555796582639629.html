      <h1>Two men lynched in Bengal over cattle theft suspicion</h1>
      <h2>The police have arrested 14 people in connection with the case and launched an investigation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:25:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dh-web-desk" target="_blank">DH Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>The lynch mobs claimed two more victims on Thursday -- this time in West Bengal's Cooch Behar district. </p>
      <p>Suspected of 'cattle theft', 30-year-old Prakash Das and 28-year-old Rabiul Islam were stopped by a mob, questioned and then beaten mercilessly, and their pick-up van set on fire after removing the cattle. Even though the police intervened and took the duo to Cooch Behar Medical College and Hospital, they succumbed to their injuries.</p>
      <p>The police have arrested 14 people in connection with the case and launched an investigation.</p>
      <p> Panchayat Pradhan Alema Yasmin, according to The Telegraph, said, "When I went to the spot, I came to know that they had been badly beaten and their vehicle set on fire. We condemn such attacks".</p>
      <p>West Bengal is among the only three Indian States that have anti-lynching laws, the other two being Manipur and Rajasthan. In the event of a death by lynching in the state, the sentence can extend to death penalty from just life imprisonment with a fine (Rs 5 lakh).</p>
      <p>The West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill was passed by the TMC government earlier in August and was backed by the CPI(M) and Congress. </p>
      <p>The bill neither had support nor faced opposition from the BJP, who claimed it "may be used for settling political scores", according to India Today.</p>
