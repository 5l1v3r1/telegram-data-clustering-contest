        <b>Ambulance bosses have opened a helpline for its workforce after three workers died in the space of 11 days.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Details of the staff members and how they came to lose their lives have not yet been revealed, but the deaths have been confirmed by a senior doctor with East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust.</p>
      <p>Dr Tom Davis, medical director for the NHS trust, said: "We are extremely sad about the deaths recently of three of our colleagues.</p>
      <p>"We have extended our sympathies to their families and friends at this difficult time and we have provided immediate support to them and to our colleagues, including a helpline staffed by trained experts.</p>
      <p>"The trust takes any concerns about the health and wellbeing of its staff extremely seriously and will always offer support to those staff who may require any help."</p>
      <p>Ambulance staff have taken to social media to express their condolences and are calling on the public to support their local paramedics.</p>
      <p>A viral Facebook post by an ambulance worker said: "Can I ask all my friends, if you see any ambulance crews out in the community, speak to them, ask if they're ok, give them a hug, get them a cuppa.</p>
      <p>"If you drive past them, sound your horn and give them the thumbs up. They need all the love and support they can get during this difficult time."</p>
