      <h1>Royal Ballet star bringing official Michael Jackson musical to Broadway in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:10:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Shortly after the premiere of Dan Reed's explosive documentary <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/leaving-neverland-big-unanswered-questions-michael-jackson-james/">Leaving Neverland</a> in February this year, which featured a series of allegations of child rape and sexual abuse against the musician, the <a href="https://chase.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/06/27/overdoses-orgies-euphoria-hbos-sexed-up-vision-teen-life-lie.html">Michael Jackson</a> musical MJ cancelled its planned tryout run in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Now, however, it seems as if the musical, which was first announced in 2018, is still going ahead, and has announced its star: 34-year-old Tony nominee Ephraim Sykes (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/hamilton-musical-ignorant-brits-guide/">Hamilton's</a> George Eacker). MJ will focus on Jackson's career from the Nineties and his Dangerous World Tour, which he cancelled in the last month amidst painkiller addiction and a lawsuit from the parents of Jordan Chandler claiming the singer “repeatedly committed sexual battery” on their son. (The case was settled out of court).</p>
      <p>MJ is set to start performances on Broadway on July 6, 2020, with an opening night on August 13, led by Pultizer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage (Sweat) and Royal Ballet dancer, director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon (An American in Paris). Lead producers include Lia Vollack and the Michael Jackson Estate, which means the musical's score will be the singer's own material. </p>
      <p>His estate has previously allowed two Cirque du Soleil shows inspired by Jackson, but not yet a biopic, and so it will remain to be seen whether certain aspects of Jackson's life will be ignored on stage. </p>
      <p>Audition notices on Broadwayworld.com suggest that, in addition to the adult Jackson, anticipated characters include Jackson at age 10; Jackson in his late teens and early 20s; a female documentary filmmaker and journalist; Jackson’s father Joseph, and Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown.</p>

      <p>Following the documentary, lifelong Michael Jackson fans Nottage and Wheeldon told the New York Times they found the accusers “very believable” , with Wheeldon saying:  “but our position in making this show is that we’re trying to make a show that’s balanced.”</p>
      <p>Nottage added: “Do I believe he was a pedophile? I don’t know that I can say one way or the other...I don’t think any of us can say with absolute certainty, because we’ve been presented with some information, but Michael Jackson is dead, he’s not in a position to defend himself.” </p>
      <p>“We’re really deeply invested in shifting the paradigm of musical-making, and particularly the jukebox musical. And Broadway certainly is ready for a musical that’s a little more serious,” Nottage concluded to the New York Times. “We want this to be a musical that everyone can come to, regardless of how they feel about Michael Jackson, and they will leave with a better understanding of who he was as a human being.” </p>
