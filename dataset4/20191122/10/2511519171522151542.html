      <h1>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reacts to Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham sacking</h1>
      <h2>Pochettino was United’s first-choice to succeed Mourinho before Solskjaer’s caretaker spell</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:12:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Critchley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has insisted that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino’s</a> availability does not bother him and that he has the full support of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was relieved of his duties by Tottenham Hotspur earlier this week with Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer’s United predecessor, appointed as his successor. </p>
      <p>The Argentine was the front-runner to replace Mourinho at Old Trafford last year until Solskjaer’s excellent caretaker spell convinced United to hire him permanently.</p>
      <p>But speculation surrounding Pochettino and United has refused to go away, particularly after Solskjaer’s mixed results at the start of the new season.</p>
      <p>Ahead of this weekend’s trip to Shefield United, Solskjaer claimed that the Pochettino does not concern him, though he understands he is in a much-coveted role.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t bother me at all,” Solskjaer said. “I’ve got the best job in the world and I’m sure that if you’re in or out of a job and you are a manager, you would want this job, so it doesn’t really matter whatever happens around it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can. I speak with Ed [Woodward] and the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward. That doesn’t change if some other clubs change their managers.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer also welcomed Mourinho back to the Premier League in his new role at Tottenham, joking that the Portuguese's return would help deflect some attention away from United.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to have Jose back, definitely, especially for you guys and maybe for me, you can talk and write about everything else," he said.</p>
      <p>“For Mauricio, it’s always sad when one of your colleagues good man loses job before Christmas. I wish him all the best.”</p>
