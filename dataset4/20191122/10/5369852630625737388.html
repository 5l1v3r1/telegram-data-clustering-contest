      <p>FLOYD MAYWEATHER JR has announced he is coming of retirement in 2020 and will work with UFC president Dana White to deliver a “spectacular event”.</p>
      <p>The unbeaten five-weight world champion boxer caused a stir when he returned to the ring in 2017 to take on UFC star Conor McGregor in a blockbuster super welterweight bout in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Having won that fight, Mayweather defeated Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in an exhibition boxing match last year before hanging up his gloves once more – but the 42-year-old appears set for another comeback.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post, Mayweather wrote alongside a picture of himself in boxing shorts with his hands taped: “Coming out of retirement in 2020.”</p>
      <p>In another, next to an image of him sitting with White, he added: “@danawhite and I working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020.” Mayweather included ‘boxing’, ‘UFC’ and ‘MMA’ in his list of accompanying hashtags.</p>
      <p>Although Mayweather has previously dismissed the idea of adding to his tally of 50 professional boxing fights, he has expressed a willingness to participate in money-spinning exhibition matches.</p>
