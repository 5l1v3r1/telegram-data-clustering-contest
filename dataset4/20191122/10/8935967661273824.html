      <p>AT&amp;T is putting the pieces in motion to bring 5G service to tens of millions of consumers and businesses in 2019, ahead of plans to offer nationwide 5G in the first half of 2020. Following its recent launch of AT&amp;T Unlimited Extra and AT&amp;T Unlimited Elite, it's adding access to 5G service in these plans and will begin pre-orders for its first low-band 5G smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G, on 25 November.</p>
      <h3>AT&amp;T on path to nationwide 5G</h3>
      <p>In the coming weeks, AT&amp;T's 5G network will launch over low-band spectrum in the Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Providence, R.I., Rochester, N.Y., and San Diego market areas. The company also plans to launch in several more markets, including Boston, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, New York City, San Francisco, Birmingham, Ala., Bridgeport, Conn., Buffalo, N.Y., Louisville, Ky., San Jose, Calif. and others.</p>
      <p>Customers with a compatible 5G device will still be able to connect to the Nation’s Best and also the Fastest Wireless Network if they travel outside the operator’s available 5G coverage area. In addition to its launch of 5G service over low-band spectrum, the company will continue to offer even faster and higher performing 5G+ over mmWave spectrum to businesses today in parts of 21 cities. It plans to reach parts of 30 cities with 5G+ in early 2020.</p>
      <h3>5G included in recently launched unlimited plans</h3>
      <p>The company said it will include access to 5G service in recently launched unlimited plans at no extra cost when it rolls out 5G in the coming weeks. </p>
      <p>In addition to 5G service included, AT&amp;T Unlimited Elite will give end-users 30 GB of mobile hotspot data per line, HBO and HD streaming all for USD 50 a month per line on 4 lines after autopay and paperless bill discount. Elite also offers 100 GB of data on a line in a bill cycle before a customer might temporarily see slow data speeds on that line when the network is busy.</p>
      <p>In May 2020, US customers who subscribe to HBO, including those who receive it as part of its existing and future postpaid wireless plans, will be able to get HBO Max at no extra charge.</p>
      <p>AT&amp;T Unlimited Extra customers will have 5G service included, as well as 15GB of mobile hotspot data per line for USD 40 a month per line on 4 lines after autopay and paperless bill discount. Extra includes 50 GB of data on a line in a bill cycle before a customer might temporarily see slow data speeds on that line when the network is busy.</p>
      <p>5G service will not be available everywhere and will require a compatible device, the company said.</p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G on pre-order</h3>
      <p>The company will start pre-orders for its first 5G device for consumers, the Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G, on 25 November. This device will be able to access the operator’s low-band 5G network at launch.</p>
      <p>Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G is offered for as low as USD 350 next week when purchased on a qualifying device installment plan, unlimited plan and trade-in.</p>
