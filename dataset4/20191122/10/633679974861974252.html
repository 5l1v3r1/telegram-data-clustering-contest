      <p>The Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, has established a three-person team to probe cases of sexual offences reported in the South African National Defence Force.</p>
      <p>The team will be chaired by Thoko Mpumlwana.</p>
      <p>According to SANDF spokesperson, Siphiwe Dlamini, the team will "review all the cases surrounding allegations of sexual offences in the SANDF".</p>
      <p>"The report that was compiled for the Minister with the list of all the sexual offences allegations will be used by the three-person team to review all sexual offences cases after which the Minister of Defence is going to engage publicly on the matter," Dlamini said.</p>
      <p>However, he said, "it was very worrying that a confidential report that was prepared for the attention of the Minister could find its way into the public domain and in particular the media."</p>
      <p>Details of the report were published in the Mail and Guardian which said it had established that there were at least 41 sexual-related cases that have been reported in just the past 18 months.</p>
      <p>According to M&amp;G, the offences ranged "from rape and assault to harassment and crimen injuria", adding that of those cases, 26 were finalised, with 13 guilty verdicts and 11 acquittals.</p>
      <p>Dlamini told Algoa FM News that the terms of reference for the special team need to be drawn up and which will establish time-frames for the completion of the investigation.</p>
