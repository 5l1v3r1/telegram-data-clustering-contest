      <p>Go and find your brown trousers, because Alien: Isolation is coming out on Nintendo Switch on 5th December, letting you play the terrifying game on the sofa, in bed, on the bog, on the train, on a plane, on a bus, where everyone can see you’re a total wuss.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/11/alien-isolation-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-year/">Announced back at E3</a>, the game’s port has been handled by Feral Interactive. It stars Amanda Ripley, Ellen Ripley’s daughter, who is determined to find her mother and has headed off to the space station Sevastopol to do so.</p>
      <p>The Switch edition of Alien: Isolation will include all the DLC that was originally released including the maps for Survivor Mode and the story content Last Survivor, which stars Ellen Ripley herself. Alien: Isolation was released back in 2014 for PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360 and PC, and was met with a lot of critical acclaim. In our review of the game Peter wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>That idea of never being comfortable with how the game is unravelling is something that feels quite unique and it’s extremely well imagined here. Plenty of survival horror games have you feeling vulnerable as you essentially fulfil the role of a hero but things are different here. In Alien: Isolation you’re not the hero, you’re the prey.</blockquote>
