      <p>Barcelona have been alerted by reports that Arsenal captain, <a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> wants to leave the London club, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>Lautaro Martinez of Inter Milan is among the favourites as Barcelona look to strengthen their frontline, and could now be joined by the Gabonese forward.</p>
      <p>According to 10sport.com, Aubameyang does not want to extend his contract with Arsenal beyond the current expiration of June 30, 2021, and has already told the club he wishes to leave.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang feel the club is not of the standing he wants and is looking to play in the Champions League, with Barcelona waiting in the wings.</p>
      <p>Arsenal will try and convince the 30-year-old to stay at the Emirates Stadium, but if not he will be free to negotiate with other clubs from January 2021, before leaving for free.</p>
      <p>Since joining Arsenal, Aubameyang has bagged 50 goals, and 12 assists, in the 79 matches he has played.</p>
      <h3>Aubameyang sends Instagram post to Gabriel Martinelli</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, on Thursday, Gabriel Martinelli posted a picture on Instagram of himself recently playing for Brazil’s under-23 side, and Aubameyang replied to the picture with: ‘Dooo brrrraaazzzzziiiiiiuuu’ with laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>Martinelli has made a big impact at the Emirates since joining from Ituano FC in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian has netted seven goals in nine appearances, including two in the recent League Cup defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was an unused substitute for the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/09/premier-league-rodgers-reveals-what-made-leicester-beat-emerys-arsenal/">Premier League(PL) loss to Leicester</a> before the international break, but is set to be included in Unai Emery’s squad for Saturday’s clash against Southampton.</p>
      <p>Arsenal adherents will be hoping that the Gabon striker continues to keep spirits high in the dressing room, ahead of the visit from Southampton.</p>
