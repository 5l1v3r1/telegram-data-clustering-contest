      <p>Earlier this week, the Slovakia international's agent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/agent-confirms-madrid-leading-skriniar-race_379913.html">revealed that</a> Madrid and Barcelona were competing for the signature of his client, who is worth £86m.</p>
      <p>However, according to reports in Spain, Los Blancos are keen to complete a deal for a figure in the region of £69m either in January or at the end of the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was linked with moves to Manchester City and Manchester United over the summer transfer window before ultimately signing a new deal at San Siro.</p>
      <p>The defender's contract, which runs until the end of the 2022-23 campaign, reportedly does not include a release clause despite various suggestions.</p>
      <p>Skriniar has made 102 appearances for the Black and Blues in all competitions since arriving in 2017.</p>
