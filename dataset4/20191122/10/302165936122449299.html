      <p>LONDON, Nov 22 — British police arrested a 23-year old man from Northern Ireland today as part of their enquiry into the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people found in the back of a truck near London last month.</p>
      <p>“He was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and remains in custody,” Essex Police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested on a motorway in Beaconsfield, a town 25 miles west of London, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The victims — 31 males and eight women — were found in a truck container on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, not far from docks on the River Thames, on October 23.</p>
      <p>The truck driver, who is also from Northern Ireland, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, and money laundering.</p>
      <p>A second man has been charged with the same offences and British authorities are trying to extradite him from Dublin.</p>
      <p>Police have also been looking for two brothers from Northern Ireland. Police in Vietnam have arrested 10 people there in connection with the deaths. — Reuters</p>
