      <p>Talking about including a special number in the web series, Ekta said, “The show already has the ‘chamak’ and ‘dhamak’. We needed some ‘namak’. That’s the missing ingredient.

I knew Sunny was perfect for what I had in mind and that’s exactly why the very first words I said to her on the call was ‘Hello Ji’.”</p>
