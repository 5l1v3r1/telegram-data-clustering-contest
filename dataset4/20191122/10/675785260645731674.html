      <h1>Argos has half Christmas trees to protect lights and decorations from pets and kids</h1>
      <h2>Perfect for space saving and inquisitive little hands, Argos is selling an array of different half Christmas trees, cut in half either horizontally or vertically</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:21:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>As much as we love all the joy that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-trees">Christmas trees</a> bring, there's also a fair bit of nuisance involved, such as little ones grabbing the branches and cats climbing up it.</p>
      <p>So to keep the festive decor out of reach from inquisitive little hands and excited animals, Argos has started selling <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fsearch%2Fhalf-christmas-tree%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fargos-half-christmas-trees-protect-20934757">half Christmas trees,</a> that come with just the top half of the tree.</p>
      <p>At 6ft high, the half Christmas trees mean that decorations are out of reach from children and pets, but could also be a great space saver for homes that struggle to find room in the corner for the traditional foliage.</p>
      <p>Costing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F8267560&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fargos-half-christmas-trees-protect-20934757">£30 for the realistic-looking green version</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F3955671&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fargos-half-christmas-trees-protect-20934757">£33.75 for the snowy version,</a> both trees are available both in store and online <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fsearch%2Fhalf-christmas-tree%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fargos-half-christmas-trees-protect-20934757">on the Argos website.</a></p>

      <p>Originally spotted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/couponmumuk/posts/3411323715607407">Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK,</a> the half trees have stirred up quite a debate online, racking up over 11,000 comments. But while some parents saying they simply ask their kids not to touch the branches, others are praising the unique space-saving idea.</p>
      <p>As well as a half Christmas tree that has lost it's lower half, we also spotted Argos selling a very unique half Christmas tree that instead has been cut in half vertically.</p>

      <p>Presumably suited for small spaces, it comes with a metal loop on the back of it, so you can easily hang it to a sturdy screw or hook.</p>
      <p>It's also currently got 10% off, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F5761959&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fargos-half-christmas-trees-protect-20934757">now £36</a> rather than its usual £40.</p>
      <p>There's also an even cheaper yet weirdly taller version of the cut in half tree on Argos too, with their 6ft pre-lit tree setting you back <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F5426304&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fargos-half-christmas-trees-protect-20934757">£18.75</a> rather than £25.</p>
