      <h1>Remedy’s Sam Lake teases new writing project</h1>

      <h3>Please be Alan Wake, please be Alan Wake...</h3>
      <p>Remedy’s Sam Lake — the face of Max Payne and the creative brain behind the likes of <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/max-payne/">Max Payne</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/alan-wake/">Alan Wake</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/quantum-break/">Quantum Break</a> </i>and <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/control/">Control</a> </i>— has taken to social media to tease his next writing project.</p>
      <p>“Shh! I’m in my brand new top secret writing lair. I [am writing] a new story,” <a href="https://twitter.com/SamLakeRMD/status/1197543340847353865/photo/1">Lake tweeted</a>, tagging Remedy Games. “You have been warned.”</p>
      <p>We don’t know what Lake’s working on — obviously — but there are a host of options. First, <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/control-alan-wake-dlc-coming-in-2020/">we know that <i>Control </i>has an <i>Alan Wake</i>-themed DLC coming in 2020</a>; it’s more than like that project is already in the works though. The new writing could also be for <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/alan-wake-tv-show-production-guys/">the Alan Wake TV show that’s currently in production</a>. Or, it could be for a new <i>Alan Wake</i> game <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/alan-wake-publishing-rights-back-remedy/">now that Remedy owns the IP and publishing rights</a>.</p>
      <p>We do concede that Lake’s next writing project might have nothing to do with <i>Alan Wake</i>… but that thought also makes us sad. What do you reckon he’s up to?</p>
