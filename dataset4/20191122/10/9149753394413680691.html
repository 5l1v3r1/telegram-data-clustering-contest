      <h1>Get £44 off the Corsair K95 Platinum RGB keyboard for Black Friday right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:00:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday gaming PC</a> deals are quickly approaching and bargains are already starting to come in strong, one of which being the Corsair K95 Platinum RGB keyboard for just <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01MR2WBTI">£130 (a saving of £44)</a>. When we <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/corsair-k95-rgb-platinum-review/">reviewed</a> the keyboard soon after it was released, we gave it a 95/100 for its great build quality and features. The main drawback at the time was its price, but now that it's significantly discounted, that's less of an issue. </p>
      <p>The K95 Platinum has been a firm favorite of ours since its launch in 2017, as it includes an anodized brushed aluminium frame, per-key RGB backlighting, Cherry MX Brown switches, six programmable macro keys, and 8MB of internal storage for retaining macros and lighting effects. The keyboard also has dedicated volume and multimedia keys, which you don't always see these days. Basically, it's packed to the gunnels with useful features. That's what's kept it in our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-gaming-keyboard/">best gaming keyboards</a> for so long, and that's what makes it well worth considering this holiday season.</p>
      <p>This is only the first of many (<i>many</i>) deals heading our way over the next few weeks,. of course. Because Black Friday isn't just 29 November; it runs right through to 6 December at the very least, and it's started as of now. Don't worry about doing the legwork, though.
