      <p>The woman presented to the CWM Hospital on 21 November 2019 and is currently admitted under isolation. The Suva Subdivisional Outbreak Response Team has responded to the notification of this new case through the tracing of contacts, with vaccination, and quarantine if needed.</p>
      <p>Fiji’s Health Ministry reports an interim shortage of the measles vaccine and additional stocks are expected to arrive soon.</p>
      <p>For this reason, the remaining measles vaccine stock will be prioritised to those who are at the greatest risk of catching and spreading measles and it is not available for the general public until additional stocks arrive in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Current stocks are being reserved for the following high-risk target groups: residents of Serua/Namosi, children from the ages of 6 months to 3 years and people travelling overseas, however proof of travel must be shown i.e. ticket/travel itinerary, not just a passport</p>
      <p>The routine immunisation of children at 12 and 18 months of age will continue as per the national immunisation schedule.</p>
      <p>The only exceptions to those in the above groups are pregnant women, those with compromised immune systems, and those with a known allergy to the vaccine. These people should not be vaccinated.</p>
