      <p>Three Nigerians were among the shortlist of players for the 2019 CAF Best XI following a great showing at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Nigeria finished third place at the 2019 AFCON with now-retired Ighalo who was the highest goalscorer making the CAF Best XI shortlist.</p>
      <p>Three other Super Eagles players Alex Iwobi, Wilfred Ndidi and Francis Uzoho, also made the shortlist for the 2019 CAF Best XI.</p>
      <p>Ndidi has been consistent for both Nigeria and Leicester City in the English Premier League where he was rated as the top tackler during the 2018-19 campaign.</p>
      <p>Both Iwobi, a former Arsenal star who now plays for Everton in England, and Uzoho were instrumental to Nigeria’s bronze medal finish earlier this year in Egypt.</p>
      <p>The 2019 CAF Best XI will be announced in a ceremony on January 7, 2019</p>
