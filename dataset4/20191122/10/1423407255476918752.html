      <h3>Other updates for Insiders</h3>
      <h4>Cortana on Windows (Beta)–Now with more productivity!</h4>
      <p>Earlier this week, we rolled out some changes to Cortana on Windows for Insiders in the Fast ring. As part of evolving Cortana from a general digital assistant to a personal productivity assistant that helps you in the Microsoft 365 apps, we’ve made several changes that will give you a glimpse into how your assistant will help you manage tasks and time and connect with people. <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/articles/cortana-windows-beta/">Read more about these changes.</a></p>
      <h3>General changes, improvements, and fixes for PC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The build watermark at the lower right-hand corner of the desktop is no longer present in this build. <b>This doesn’t mean we’re done…</b></li>
        <li>We fixed an issue where if you started to reset your MSA pin from the sign-in screen and left it without interacting with it for some time, it would result in a black screen, requiring a reboot to recover.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue that could result in night light settings getting lost on the primary monitor when the system is connected/disconnected from a secondary monitor.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue that could result in an out of memory message when watching a long HEVC video.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue resulting in certain apps not fully filling the screen when maximized in recent builds.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Known issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, we have applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details</a>.</li>
        <li>We’re looking into reports of the update process hanging for extended periods of time when attempting to install a new build.</li>
        <li>We’ve heard that Settings still isn’t available outside of launching via the URI (ms-settings:) for some Insiders and are investigating.</li>
        <li>Some Insiders are reporting that after successfully installing printer drivers from the Optional Updates section, the same driver is still showing as available for install. We’re looking into the issue.</li>
        <li>We’re looking into reports of certain external USB 3.0 drives not responding with Start Code 10 or 38 after they’re attached.</li>
      </ul>
