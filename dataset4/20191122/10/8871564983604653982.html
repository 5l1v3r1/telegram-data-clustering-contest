      <h1>Tinashe, Krewella, Cash Cash, Claptone make up latest additions to Djakarta Warehouse Project 2019’s full lineup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:28:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>We only have under a month to go to the 11th edition of Djakarta Warehouse Project (DWP) — which will mark the return of one of the biggest dance and electronic music festivals in Asia to Jakarta after the festival moved to Bali to mark its 10th anniversary last year.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, festival promoter Ismaya Live announced the last batch of local and international performers to complete its lineup.</p>
      <p>The highlight is undoubtedly American singer-songwriter/actress Tinashe being lined up for her debut on Indonesian soil. Tinashe’s music explores alternative R&amp;B, pop, and hip hop, and she released her new album <i>Songs For You </i>yesterday — the first independent release after leaving her former label. </p>
      <p>There will also be Claptone, the plague doctor-style golden mask-clad House and Tech House DJ and producer duo from Germany — whose real identities are still mysterious to this day. Krewella, an American electronic dance music duo consisting of sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf, will also perform their slew of hits for the festival goers.</p>
      <p>American EDM mainstays Cash Cash, breakout Belgian Dance/Electronic DJ Anouk Matton AKA, as well as Australian DJ and producer Moutaiz Al-Oubaidi AKA Motez, will also be spinning their tunes on DWP’s stages.</p>
      <p>Barong Family — the label founded by Dutch DJ duo and DWP returnees Yellow Claw — will be inviting a host of new names for their stage takeover including American DJ Ghastly, Dutch DJ duo Moksi, Dutch DJ and producer Wiwek, Taiwanese DJ RayRay, and Indonesian DJ Sihk.</p>
      <p>Festival goers can also catch the performances of Dutch-born, Ibiza-based DJ Chelina Manuhutu, China’s DJ L, Swedish trio Brohug, Elrow resident Mario Biani, Snatch Records’ head honcho Italian DJ and producer Riva Starr, as well as trance DJs Mark Sixma and Jordan Suckley.</p>
      <p>The 2019 lineup already boasted the genre’s heavyweights when festival promoter Ismaya Live announced their <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/lifestyle/djakarta-warehouse-project-returns-to-jakarta-for-its-11th-edition-calvin-harris-martin-garrix-skrillex-zedd-headlining/">first</a> and <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/lifestyle/disclosure-chromeo-dj-set-bassjackers-and-markus-schulz-announced-for-djakarta-warehouse-project-2019/">second phase</a> of headliners, such as Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, American EDM/dubstep DJ Skrillex, Dutch DJ Martin Garrix, English electronic music duo Disclosure, and Canadian electro-funk duo Chromeo.</p>
      <p>If you’ve just been convinced to go to DWP, you may need to secure your tickets ASAP as they are likely to run out fast. Tickets for 1-day, 3-day, VIP Gold, group package, travel package (for festival-goers from outside Jakarta or Indonesia) as well as VVIP Sofa are available on <a href="http://www.djakartawarehouse.com/">DWP’s official website</a> and offline at several Ismaya restaurants. International festival-goers may get their tickets via online ticketing platforms such as <a href="https://www.festground.com/">Festground</a>, <a href="http://www.ticketek.com/">Ticketek</a>, <a href="https://www.festicket.com/">Festicket</a>, and <a href="https://iflyer.tv/en/">iFlyer</a>.</p>
      <p>The prices (before 25% tax) start at IDR1.5 million for 3-day early admission passes (which require ticket holders to arrive at the venue before 7pm) and go up to a package of 3-day VIP Gold tickets plus 3-night stay at Grand Mercure Kemayoran priced at IDR16.2 million for two people.</p>
      <p>(US$1 = IDR14,100)</p>
