      <p>From zombies to dinosaurs to professional wrestlers, Local Comic Shop Day offers a wide variety of offbeat characters as comic-book stores kick off the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>This year, more than 600 stores worldwide have signed up to be part of Local Comic Shop Day, set for Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 18 LCSD-specific items go on sale in participating local stores Saturday, and are not to be sold online before Monday.</p>
      <p>Local Comic Shop Day is a five-year old event conceived and implemented by ComicsPRO comic book specialty retailers to call attention to locally owned independent comic-book stores.</p>
      <p>One of the items appearing at this year’s Local Comic Shop Day is “The Walking Dead: The Alien,” the first print comic featuring “The Walking Dead” since the series ended unexpectedly earlier this year. The comic, originally a digital exclusive, is by the creative team of writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Marcos Martin.</p>
      <p>“The Walking Dead” co-creator, Robert Kirkman, is featured in another Local Comic Shop Day comic, “Super Dinosaur #1 Special Edition.” “Super Dinosaur,” which first appeared as an Image comic, is now an animated series on Amazon Prime.</p>
      <p>Making its debut nationwide on Local Comic Shop Day is “Over the Ropes” #1. The comic, from Mad Cave, is set in a fictionalized version of the world of 1990s wrestling. Young high-flyer Jason Lynn goes off-script in a match to win the world title, then becomes the talk of the Southern territory as the face-painted wrestler called Phoenix.</p>
      <p>“On the surface, Over the Ropes may seem like another Saturday morning wrestling show, but in reality, it’s about the underdog in all of us fighting and clawing for one moment in the spotlight,” writer Jay Sandlin said at madcavestudios.com. “The characters grew out of my desire to write the kind of wrestling story I gravitated to the most; where the predetermined nature of in-ring action and backstage drama blends with shades of reality until the two are indistinguishable.”</p>
      <p>In addition, comics fans will find longtime favorites, including Carnage, Doctor Who, and the Crow among this year’s offerings.</p>
