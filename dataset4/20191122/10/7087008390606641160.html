      <h1>Bitcoin Price Plunges To $7000: Will The Historic Support Line Save Bitcoin?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:34:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:34</time> by <a rel="author">Yuval Gov</a></address>
      <p>Just yesterday, we had celebrated the goodbye party from the $8000 price level, which held Bitcoin for the past couple of days.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s bloody price action <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bloody-thursday-bitcoin-plunges-800-today-back-to-october-lows/">ended </a>up in a retest of the significant support area of $7400. The last was the lowest price level of BTC before the vast 42% price surge, which took place on October 26, and ended up touching $10,350.</p>
      <p>It’s not even a month later, and Bitcoin is down again, no recognition of the October 26 impressive price surge. Bitcoin is now struggling, marking $7000 as it’s current daily low (as of writing this). This is a new monthly low for Bitcoin, and the lowest price the cryptocurrency had seen in the past six months, since May 17.</p>
      <p>Looking on the following daily chart, Bitcoin touched a historic support trend-line, which started forming in April this year. So far, the support line, along with the psychological level of $7000, holds well. However, things can change at any moment.</p>
      <p>After such severe declines, which lasts so far for the past five consecutive daily candles (in case today won’t surprise and close above $7700), the crypto market is bearish without a doubt.</p>
      <p>Total Market Cap: $197 billion</p>
      <p>Bitcoin Market Cap: $130 billion</p>
      <p>BTC Dominance Index: 66.0%</p>

      <h3>Key Levels to Watch</h3>
      <p><b>– Support/Resistance:</b> After breaking down the $7400 support, this level had now turned into the first resistance from above. Further above lies old support at $7700 (which was confirmed as resistance during yesterday’s price action).</p>
      <p>From below, the $6K prefix is closer than ever: In case $7000 gets broken down, there is not much demand till the $6200 area. There might be some support at $6600, but the panic could quickly get Bitcoin to $6000 and even below ($5400 -$5600</p>
      <p><b>– The RSI Indicator:</b> As <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-facing-decision-point-today-goodbye-party-for-8000-starting-now/">said here</a> yesterday – the RSI looks very bearish. Since yesterday the RSI discovered new lows, now encountering the 25 levels, which might halt the declines for a bit.</p>
      <p>Stochastic RSI oscillator is pointing on oversold on the 1-day chart. This can lead to a possible positive correction in the case of a cross-over.</p>
      <p><b>– Trading volume:</b> The bears are here. After no significant volume days, yesterday <a href="https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&amp;r=day&amp;t=b">seen</a> the highest volume day since the end of October. Blood on the streets.</p>
