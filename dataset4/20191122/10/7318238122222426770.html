      <h1>Musk unveils 'bulletproof' electric Tesla truck, but window cracks</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES — Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/tesla-unveils-its-first-electric-pickup-cybertruck-starting-39-900-n1089416">rolled out an electric "Cybertruck"</a> at a launch event on Thursday, and sought to show off the vehicle's sturdiness but the test hit a bump in the road.</p>
      <p>A sledgehammer was swung at the doors of the silver vehicle, with no apparent effect. A video played on screens showing a bullet striking it, and Musk said, "It is literally bulletproof to a 9 mm handgun, that's how strong the skin is."</p>
      <p>He joked that federal work safety rules, as well as California's gun laws, precluded a live demonstration.</p>
      <p>But when a metal sphere was hurled against the window, with the words "demo Tesla armor glass" lit on screen, in a test of strength, the glass cracked.</p>
      <p>"Well, maybe that was a little too hard," the Tesla and SpaceX tech entrepreneur said to the crowd at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, which is a city in the Los Angeles area. "It didn't go through."</p>
      <p>When the ball was thrown against a second window, it also cracked. "Not bad — room for improvement," Musk joked.</p>
      <p>"We threw wrenches, we threw everything. We even literally threw the kitchen sink at the glass, and it didn't break. For a little weird reason, it broke now, I don't know why," Musk said on stage, remarks that elicited laughter.</p>

      <p>The incident was widely shared, with journalists tweeting their amusement.</p>
      <p>The pickup, which Musk said will cost $39,900 and up, will have an estimated battery range of between 250 miles to more than 500 miles.</p>
      <p>With the launch, Tesla is edging into the most profitable corner of the U.S. auto market, where buyers tend to have fierce brand loyalty, The Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>The truck is Tesla's sixth vehicle since it was founded in 2003, and its most experimental, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/tesla-cybertruck-unveiled.html">according to CNBC</a>. It will be competing in a market against the Ford F Series, which has been the best-selling pickup for more than 40 years in the U.S., followed by GM's Chevrolet Silverado, another formidable competitor.</p>
      <p>The cybertruck starts at $39,900 for a single motor model, with a base price of $69,900 for a tri motor all-wheel drive model.</p>
      <p>Production will take place in late 2021, Tesla said, though production for the tri motor model will start in late 2022.</p>
