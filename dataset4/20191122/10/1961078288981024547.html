      <p>Many vegetarians forgo a main dish and instead pile their table with side dishes. We can get on board with that. There’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020600-buttered-stuffing-with-celery-and-leeks">stuffing</a> (or <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020554-stuffing-stuffed-mushrooms">stuffing-stuffed mushrooms!</a>), <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016914-vermont-cheddar-mashed-potatoes">mashed potatoes</a> (don’t forget the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017760-vegan-mushroom-make-ahead-gravy">gravy</a>!) and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020575-mashed-sweet-potatoes-with-maple-and-brown-butter">sweet potatoes</a>.

      </h3>
      <p>Many desserts are vegetarian, but we’ll take this opportunity to plug some of our readers favorite dessert recipes anyway. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017817-cranberry-curd-tart">David Tanis’s cranberry curd tart</a> is jaw-droppingly beautiful, an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cranberrycurdtart/">Instagram-worthy</a> crowd favorite that’s also gluten-free. (Pro tip: The secret to achieving that ruby red color every time is puréeing the cooked cranberries in a blender or food processor, then straining the curd at least once through a fine-mesh sieve.) If you think there’s no such thing as a dessert that isn’t chocolate, we have three words for you: <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015214-pecan-pie-truffles">pecan pie truffles</a>. For traditionalists, our <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12320-apple-pie">apple pie</a>, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015622-pumpkin-pie">pumpkin pie</a> and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1766-bourbon-pecan-pie">pecan pie</a> are tried-and-true. Just add <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017613-easiest-vanilla-ice-cream">ice cream</a> or <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015882-whipped-cream">whipped cream</a>, or both.</p>
