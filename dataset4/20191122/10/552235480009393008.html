      <h2>Charmaine Kelly told how she was given her marching orders when she returned to work having spent two days with her family following the tragedy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:52:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>A grieving single mother has told how cruel bosses <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/job-losses">sacked</a> her for taking two days off work after her aunt's tragic death.</p>
      <p>Charmaine Kelly had been working at the TNC debt collectors in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> for just over a month when her aunt Tracey Speirs, 49, suddenly died in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old said she contacted her manager to request the Monday and Tuesday off to be with her devastated mum who usually looks after her <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">daughter</a> Rhiann, eight, while she is at work.</p>
      <p>Bosses allegedly said they 'could not advise' how long she should take off and that any leave would be at Charmaine's 'own risk' despite her bereavment.</p>
      <p>She was then fired on the spot after arriving at work on Wednesday - a decision bosses said they 'didn't need to explain', she claims.</p>
      <p>Now Charmaine, from Drongan in Ayrshire, faces an agonising Christmas without work while still grieving the loss of her aunt.</p>
      <p>She told the Record: "When I called up after my auntie passed on Sunday, I was told taking time off was at my own risk.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"I went back to work on Wednesday and my manager came over and told me 'I don’t have to give you a reason or explain myself but I'm terminating your employment right now'.</p>
      <p>"I couldn’t see for crying after it happened, I have a house to keep, a daughter and no job with Christmas coming up.</p>
      <p>"Everything has totally gone to pot, it's just so heartless and has totally broken me. We're such a close family and it's left me so stressed."</p>

      <p>Charmaine recalls how she was offered the collecting agent position with the firm on October 14, directly after an interview.</p>
      <p>She started at the Glasgow office on St. Vincent Street the following day on a three-month probation period, but says she wasn't given an official contract.</p>
      <p>The firm helps collect debt for late payment such as council tax and parking fines for all organisations which offer credit.</p>
      <p>But former employees have branded the company a "disgrace" and "seedy" in scathing reviews left online. Charmaine also claims the company deleted a review she submitted after being sacked.</p>

      <p>And when her other aunt called up to complain, the manager allegedly said 'this conversation is turning sour' and put the phone down.</p>
      <p>The Daily Record attempted to contact TNC collections twice for comment, but representatives for the company said "we don't talk to the media" before terminating our call.</p>
      <p>A representative at the Glasgow branch also declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Charmaine added: "I think it’s really disgusting what they did to me.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn’t want anyone to have to suffer like this, it’s heartbreaking. I just wish it was all a dream."</p>
