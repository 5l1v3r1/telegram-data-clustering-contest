      <p>"I understand. I'm empathetic to what they're going through, and I'm upset that the situation has escalated to the point where these businesses have to leave. I'm not happy."</p>
      <p>That reaction from Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran to news Boyds Tire and Auto Service and Eco-Clean are leaving the Leon Avenue area.</p>
      <p>After dealing with many of the social issues associated with the area, both have decided enough is enough.</p>
      <p>"All I can say is we care about the businesses downtown and we're doing everything we possibly can with every resource available to us to help fix this. But, I've said this many times, there are no quick fixes."</p>
      <p>Basran says dealing with homelessness on Leon and elsewhere is the city's No. 1 priority.</p>
      <p>"The No. 1 priority is getting people a roof over their heads and the supports they need to deal with whatever the underlying issue is that has put them on the streets.</p>
      <p>"While it may not seem like much is happening ... we are doing everything we can at the municipal level, keeping in mind this is not something a municipal government on its own (is responsible for), when we don't provide housing, mental health care or addiction treatment. This is not something the city can solve on its own because we can't just solve this with enforcement."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the situation seems to be escalating on Leon Avenue, with the number of people hunkering down along the 200 block almost doubling over the past several weeks.</p>
      <p>Basran says contributing factors may include the closure of Inn From the Cold and stepped up enforcement and patrols along the Rail Trail, where many had been camping during the summer.</p>
      <p>"As you know, we are not able to prohibit people from sleeping on public spaces if there are not enough shelter beds. Right now, there are not enough shelter beds, which means we cannot prohibit people from sleeping on public spaces."</p>
