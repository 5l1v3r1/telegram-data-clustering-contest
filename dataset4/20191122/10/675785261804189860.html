      <p>Jacqueline will be checked into Snake Hotel where they will encounter lots of the slithering beasts.</p>
      <p>The scaly reptiles will be lurking all over the mock-up hotel room and corridors while she is under pressure to hunt out the stars to get food to camp.</p>
      <p>They will be competing to get 10 stars to feed both camps - the original as well as the jailhouse site where four campmates have been exiled to.</p>
      <p>Others added: "Awwww I hope Jacqueline absolutely smashes the next trial like she did with the spider one! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ."</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/imaceleb?src=hashtag_click">#imaceleb</a> Jacqueline doing a trial please why would anyone vote for that cutie I feel so bad for my favourite."</p>
      <p>"Why is everyone being so mean to Jacqueline I don’t get it she’s a cutie pie <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ."</p>

      <p>But husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> thinks it will be "good" for Jacqueline as he's excited to watch the trial.</p>
      <p>Fans watched on with awe as Jacqueline found her courage when she faced her biggest fear spiders in her first I'm A Celeb trial.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star had 50 spiders crawling around in the head tank with her and 20 in the box where her hands were retrieving the stars.</p>
      <p>While she cried watching all her camp mates perform their trials, she put on a brave face and managed to get both her allocated stars.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dan has been tasked with looking after their daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, while he holds down the fort at home.</p>
