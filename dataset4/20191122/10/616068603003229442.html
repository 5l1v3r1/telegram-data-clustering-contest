      <p>The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team has taken over the scene of what is now being called a homicide in Surrey.</p>
      <p>IHIT were called after two people were found dead in a residence in the 14000-block of 102A Avenue, Surrey Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>“Although our investigation is in its early stages, at this time it appears as though one of the deceased was the victim of a homicide.  We are working hard to gather evidence to identify the events surrounding this tragedy,” says Constable Harrison Mohr with IHIT.</p>
      <p>Police indicate they do not believe the general public is any danger and that this is an isolated incident with no risk to the public.  “We are not looking for any outstanding suspects, and can confirm that both persons knew each other,” Cst. Mohr says.</p>
      <p>Officers from IHIT, along with the Victim Services unit from the Surrey RCMP are in the process of reaching out to the family and friends of the people involved.  We will be offering our support to them, and seeking any information they can provide.</p>
