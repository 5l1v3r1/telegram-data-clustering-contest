      <p>Developer Ghost Games has been celebrating the launch of its road-ripper <i>Need for Speed: Heat</i>, after the latest entry in the long line of racing games saw the franchise's biggest launch this generation.<br/><br/>"<i>NFS Heat</i> set a new record during the first week with more of you playing this game than any other <i>NFS</i> title this generation," tweeted Ghost Games. "Thanks to our community for bringing the Heat!" The actual sales figures themselves were not revealed.<br/><br/>This milestone means <i>NFS Heat</i> has surpassed the launch figures for the eighth generation's previous <i>Need for Speed</i> releases, including <i>Rivals, No Limits,</i> and <i>Payback</i>, as well as the 2015 reboot, simply titled <i>Need for Speed</i>. <i>NFS Heat</i> has garnered mostly positive - but not exceptional - reviews from the gaming press and its fanbase.<br/><br/><i>Need for Speed Heat</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One.</p>
