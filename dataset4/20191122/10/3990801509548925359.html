      <h1>CHEAP: Game ’til you drop with 20% off Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus 2TB SSD</h1>
      <h2>These new games are eating up your space</h2>

        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Let me hit you with a math problem. If <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> requires 175 GB of space to run properly and <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> requires another 150 GB of space, what does that mean for you? It means you’ll need a whole lot of extra storage if you’re into gaming (especially if you’re not foolish enough to fall for <a href="https://twitter.com/Nitomatta/status/1196485009315520512">cloud gaming</a>).</p>
      <p>It’s not all bad, though: storage is getting pretty cheap these days. There’s currently a sweet deal on one of the best SSDs in the market, Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus. You can grab a 2TB model for just $400 — a 20-percent discount off its list price of $500. Not bad at all.</p>
      <p>This beast supports read and write speeds of up to 3,500 MB/s and 3,300 MB/s, respectively. Not only that, its performance actually lives up to the marketing claims. Trust me, I’ve got one of these — albeit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-970-EVO-Plus-MZ-V7S2T0B/dp/B07MFZXR1B/?tag=tnw88-20">the 1TB version</a> — in my own home station, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice.</p>
      <p>You’ll also get a five-year limited warranty (or 600 terabytes written) in case anything goes wrong.</p>

      <p>If you’re in the market for an portable drive, you can still go for the 970 EVO Plus, but <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/08/intel-660p-ssd-nvme-cheap-drive/">you’ll need an enclosure to re-appropriate it for external use</a>. Really though, you’d be wasting its might if you intend to use it externally. This baby was made to live inside your PC — and that’s where it’ll serve you best. Anyways, we’ll leave the decision up to you.</p>
