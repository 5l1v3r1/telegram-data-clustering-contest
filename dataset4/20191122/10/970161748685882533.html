      <p>A scary new study has revealed that asteroids big enough to wipe out millions of people hit Earth much more frequently than previously believed.</p>
      <p>Scientists analysed Wolfe Creek Crater, which is believed to be the second-largest impact crater on Earth, and found that the cosmic collision took place more recently than expected.</p>
      <p>But before we go on to tell you about how nervous you should be, it’s worth a quick reminder of the different types of space objects.</p>
      <p>An asteroid is made of rock or metal, while a comet is made of ice and gas.</p>
      <p>They become meteors when they hit our planet and the objects which fall to Earth without burning up are called meteorites.</p>
      <p>Wolfe Creek Crater was formed when a 15 metre-wide meteorite weighing around 14,000 tonnes smashed into the ground at a speed of 17 kilometres a second, the researchers said.</p>

      <p>It exploded with the force of 0.54 megatons of TNT – which is roughly equivalent to 36 of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.</p>

      <p>Research by an international team led by Professor Tim Barrows from the University of Wollongong has found that the object probably hit us 120,000 years ago – much more recently than the previous estimate of 300,000 years.</p>
      <p>This finding prompted Barrows to increase the estimate of how often we are hit by similar-sized objects.</p>
      <p>He claimed a similar impact could occur roughly once every two centuries.</p>
      <p>‘Although the rate is only one large meteor hitting Australia every 17,000 years, it isn’t that simple,’ he said.</p>
      <p>“The craters are only found in the arid parts of Australia. Elsewhere, craters are destroyed by geomorphic activity like river migration or slope processes in the mountains.</p>

      <p>‘Since Australia has an excellent preservation record with dated craters within the arid zone, we can extrapolate a rate for the whole Earth.</p>
      <p>‘Taking into account that arid Australia is only about one per cent of the surface, the rate increases to one every 180 years or so.</p>
      <p>‘This is a minimum estimate because some smaller impacts were probably covered by sand during the ice age. The number of large objects is probably 20 times this number because stony meteorites are far more common but not as many survive the fiery journey through the atmosphere or effectively make craters.</p>
      <p>‘Our results give us a better idea of how frequent these events are.’</p>

      <p>Professor Barrows and his colleagues used two techniques to date the crater: exposure dating (which estimates the length of time rock on Earth’s surface has been exposed to cosmic radiation) and optically stimulated luminescence (which measures how long ago the sediment was last exposed to sunlight).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They also created a new 3D model of the crater using aerial photographs and used this to calculate the crater’s dimensions.</p>
      <p>‘We calculate that the maximum width of the crater is 946 metres in a NE-SW direction, reflecting the direction of the impact. The average diameter is 892 metres.</p>
      <p>‘We predict a depth of 178 metres and that it is filled by about 120 metres of sediment, mostly sand blown in from the desert,’ Professor Barrows said.</p>
      <p>If a city had been standing on the site when the meteorite hit, it would been utterly destroyed.</p>
