      <h1>21 Bridges review: Chadwick Boseman’s star power can’t save cliche cop thriller</h1>

        <b>As a huge fan of Chadwick Boseman, this is difficult to say. For all his efforts, the role of an aloof, trigger-happy NYPD cop surprisingly isn’t where he excels. Or perhaps the script for 21 Bridges is just so bland that it greatly impacts his ability to pull it off convincingly.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Based on Chadwick’s past work, we’ll go with the latter.</p>
      <p>It seemed like a no-brainer collaboration – Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo stepping on to produce a high-pulse, adrenaline-heavy cop thriller starring Black Panther (Chadwick) himself. It should have been the stuff of cinematic dreams.</p>
      <p>But while 21 Bridges, directed by Brian Kirk, had all the potential in the world, it failed to offer anything new in the cat-and-mouse genre with a twist that was fairly underwhelming.</p>
      <p>Chadwick stars as Andre Davis, a New York City detective on the hunt for two drug dealers who killed eight cops after storming a restaurant for the cocaine.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The city-wide chase begins with the NYPD agreeing to shut down the island – Manhattan – to tighten the net on the two criminals. This means closing all the entry points to the city – the 21 bridges – in order to trap their suspects and the chase ensues.</p>
      <p>When we’re introduced to Andre, he’s sitting in an internal affairs interrogation due to an investigation into his conduct on-the-job. It turns out our hero has shot eight suspects in as many years but he argues it was ‘just cause’ as he never shot first.</p>

      <p>Of course, he’s not simply a deranged, trigger-happy bent cop.</p>
      <p>Andre’s police officer father was slain in the line of duty during his childhood and we see a snapshot of Andre’s grief at the funeral in the opening shot. If that didn’t tug at the heartstrings, well Andre’s mother is battling dementia which is used as an obvious attempt to appeal to his softer side.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They’re cheap, cliched attempts at explaining why Andre is the way he is, and both subplots end up going absolutely nowhere seemingly nothing to do with present events.</p>
      <p>And, what did happen to his mother? We never saw her again and need to know she’s OK.</p>
      <p>Andre is unwillingly partnered up with DEA agent Frankie Burns, played by Sienna Miller with a very dodgy New York borough accent and nothing of substance to offer. Frankie is roped into some key parts of the story but, aside from that, she’s easily forgettable.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, the real heroes of 21 Bridges aren’t the a-list names on the poster, but the side characters.</p>
      <p>If you watched 2018’s stunningly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/08/beale-street-talk-finally-offers-beautiful-representation-black-love-trauma-aside-8479637/">heart wrenching love story If Beale Street Could Talk</a>, you’ll know Stephan James is a force to be reckoned with. His stunning performance in the Oscar-winning movie left a stain on our heart and set him up for great things to come.</p>
      <p>In 21 Bridges, he’s one of the cop killers on-the-run and, boy, can he run. Stephan’s character Michael certainly gives a good chase positioning himself as a promising action star. Even in the few scenes he had, Stephan gave all the heart and dimension that the script was so desperately lacking in other areas.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Michael’s sidekick Ray (Taylor Kitsch) and their drug money launderer offer gritty and sophisticated performances respectively, giving us tense moments we can sink our teeth into.</p>
      <p>21 Bridges is cinematically stylish and slick with stunning shots of the New York City skyline. It’s just a shame the script wasn’t as well put together as the cinematography.</p>
