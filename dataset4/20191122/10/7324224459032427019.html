      <h1>Friend is now a foe for Osama Mohamed</h1>
      <h2>Osama Mohamed will put friendship aside when he continues his quest for more national glory on Sunday, writes Nick Elwell.</h2>

      <p>The Lions Boxing Club ace will step into the ring at Solihull’s Tudor Grange Academy for a NAGBC’s Championship semi-final clash.</p>
      <p>And the 15-year-old who is on the England Boxing Pathway, will know the strengths and weaknesses of his opponent in the 57kg Class A category, Sharpstyle ABC’s Levi Barnes, having already beaten him this season and sparred with him on numerous occasions.</p>
      <p>Mohamed, who won the National Junior Cadet title earlier this year and a second successive gold in the prestigious Monkstown Cup, added to his growing reputation with a hugely impressive victory against Miley Cash in the quarter-finals of the competition last weekend.</p>
      <p>And Kev Dillon, head coach at the Brierley Hill-based fight factory, is hoping his young star can hit those standards again.</p>
      <p>“It was a really comfortable victory for Osama,” said Dillon. “He boxed really well against a very good lad who has been an ABA champion.</p>
      <p>“Osama was just too fast and too strong. In fairness, the lad was hanging on in the last round.</p>
      <p>“It was a brilliant display against a high-calibre opponent.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully Osama will follow that up with another victory on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“He will have to be at his best because the lad he is fighting, Levi Barnes, is also on the England Boxing Pathway.</p>
      <p>“They spar regularly together at the England training camps and they have become friends.</p>
      <p>“But they won’t be friends in the ring because they both want the same thing, and that is a British title.</p>
      <p>“He is a tricky boxer. Osama will have to maintain a high work rate and beat him to the punch.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a good contest, but Osama can take some confidence from the fact he got the better of him on a split decision on our last show.</p>
      <p>“Tom Jones won the All England National Development title last month and it would be fantastic for the club to have another national champion.”</p>
      <p>It’s a busy time for Dillon, with Lions staging their latest club show at Wilson Hall in Cradley next Friday.</p>
