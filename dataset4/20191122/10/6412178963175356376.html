        <b>Leeds are preparing to swoop after Burnley boss Sean Dyche cleared striker Matej Vydra to leave the club in January to get more game time, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vydra moved to Turf Moor from Derby last summer in an £11m move and having only played 13 Premier League games last season, the Czech Republic international has only played four so far this time round and is yet to start.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, Dyche realises the striker is unlikely to see his game time increase and is prepared to let him leave for a cut-price fee in January.</p>
      <p>The newspaper says that Dyche is willing to see a £7.5m deal go through with Leeds said to be heavily interested in the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that given Vydra has experience in the Championship, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/leeds-united"><b>Whites</b></a> boss Marcelo Bielsa wants to add the attacker to his squad in January as they look to mount a serious promotion push.</p>
      <p>Vydra has played 22 games for <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/burnley"><b>Burnley</b></a> since his move from the Rams, scoring two goals and assisting four others in that time.</p>
      <p>The Clarets make their return from the international break on Saturday when they play Watford at Vicarage Road in Premier League action.</p>
