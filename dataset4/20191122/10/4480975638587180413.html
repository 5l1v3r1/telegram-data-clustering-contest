      <h3>Commodity Report: Crude Oil Price Forecast [Video]</h3>
      <p><b>Oil prices have pulled back from their highest levels </b>in two months on Friday.

      <h4>Market Wrap: Christine Lagarde, dire PMIs and oil prices</h4>
      <p>We’ve been quite struck by the resurgence in oil prices over the past two days. <b>WTI crude oil futures are back near two-month highs</b>. It has been interesting to see petrol prices gain while other markets sensitive to the US-China trade war lose out. </p>
      <p>We are interpreting this pickup in oil prices as a refocus on supply-side issues in the <b>lead up to the OPEC meeting in December</b>. The price action implies more than we have seen in the news flow. Reports in recent days have suggested OPEC+ will extend its output cuts at its upcoming meeting. We think an extension was already priced in so markets might be positioning for deeper output cuts. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/market-wrap-christine-lagarde-dire-pmis-and-oil-prices-201911220946">Read more...</a></p>
