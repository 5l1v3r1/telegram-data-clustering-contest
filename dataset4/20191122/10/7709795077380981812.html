      <p>Notebook horse <b>Rockpoint </b>ran a fine race when a close second to classy Wholestone in the extended 3m novices' chase at Cheltenham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>True, the winner idled on the run-in but Rockpoint had found a second wind having hit a flat spot coming down the hill. This strong stayer raced prominently until the 11th but was detached in fifth before making strong headway approaching two-out.</p>
      <p>He stayed on well after the last but was always being held by Wholestone. I'd love to see Rockpoint fitted with headgear, cheekpieces might be sufficient. In addition, his confidence could increase after this second run back from a wind operation.</p>
      <p>Fellow 'Notebooker'<b> Pop Rockstar</b> travelled well for a long way before tiring markedly up the hill at the end of a gruelling extended 3m3f on the same card.</p>
      <p>This was a step up in trip for the seven-year-old but connections hoped he would be a Welsh National candidate, so I was surprised to see his run peter out in the final stages.</p>
      <p>Keep with this fine gelding because he will drop a couple of pounds in the handicap and had been moving like a well treated horse before the extreme distance caught him out. Still exciting.</p>
      <p>Across the card, <b>Miah Grace</b> ran into a very smart winner when second to favourite Big Bad Bear in the Introductory Hurdle at Wetherby.</p>
      <p>Jedd O'Keeffe's four-year-old deserves credit for giving the well fancied year-older winner a tough time throughout the final two furlongs and can surely win races.</p>
      <p>Leading the field, the mare hit the second and was headed by the gelding two-out but chased Big Bad Bear all the way to the line and has a fine attitude, despite hanging right near the line.</p>
      <p>Miah Grace had previously impressed at Hexham on her hurdling debut when returning from a lay-off and will continue to do well, especially against her own gender.</p>
      <p>Look out for a big run from <b>Bigbadandbeautiful </b>in the mares' Listed bumper at Navan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gordon Elliot's classy mare beat her own gender in a similar race at Gowran on last month's reappearance.</p>
      <p>This was a strong event and many impressed in the paddock, including Jamie Codd's mount.</p>
      <p>Held up towards rear, she was still well behind at halfway but made headway going well to chase the leaders on the outer over three-out.</p>
      <p>She improved again to lead on the near side entering the final furlong and stayed on strongly for a comfortable success.</p>
      <p>An easy winner at Clonmel 141 days earlier, she had run a cracker behind very classy Santa Rossa in a Grade Two at Leopardstown in February and I can't wait to see her over hurdles.</p>
      <p>Connections pinpointed Sunday's race after her Gowran victory and although she shows very little on the gallops at home, Bigbadandbeautiful could be the best mare in Elliot's stable.</p>
