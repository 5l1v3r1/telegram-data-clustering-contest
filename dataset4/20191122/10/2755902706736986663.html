          <b>Shocking As Pregnant Teen Found To Be A Virgin</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>In a very strange incident evocative of the biblical virgin conception, a 16-year-old pregnant Zimbabwean teenager has been confirmed a virgin, Harare Hospital and private hospital medical reports confirm. According to a medical affidavit availed to the local publication, <a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/mufakose-virgin-pregnant/">H-Metro</a>, the girl (name withheld) is now eight months pregnant.</p>
      <p>Investigations conducted by the publication have since exposed the ‘mysterious’ pregnancy.  In an interview,  the minor revealed that she had dodged a near-sex experience with the alleged father, Blessing Nyagomo. In mitigation, she said that there was no penetration during the act. Although medical reports have since confirmed that the minor is still a virgin, several inconsistencies to the narrative were noted after a separate interview with Nyagomo.</p>
      <p>Nyagomo told the publication that he had had intercourse with the minor on several occasions.</p>
      <aside><i><b>Ndongozvitengesera chamba: changu, handina hard ne munhu, even vakati ndichengete mwana handirambe.</b></i><br/>The child has nothing to do with whatever issues that we had with the mother’s side, but I am ready and I’ll do whatéver it takes to be there for my child.</aside>

      <p>A local gynaecologist said that it’s possible, but not common.</p>
      <aside>Theoretically, it is possible that this can happen, but it’s also not common as it depends on various factors of the apparatus of an individual and this is a generalised view.<br/>.<br/>Another local doctor, who preferred anonymity, said:<br/>It is not a miracle that such a thing has happened. Sometimes there could csbe a slight penetration or even that semen flows without penetration, but there should be a tear in order for it to pass through.</aside>

      <p>Sister to the minor, who is now the guardian, claims the gynaecologists are set to conduct a caesarean section in since the child is still a minor and is frail.</p>
      <aside>About the caesarean section, it’s a matter of her being a minor. She might not be able to push a baby that’s why there is need to conduct a caesarean.<br/>Our father passed on, and I’m here at this rented place taking care of my sister as well as my son.<br/>The minor, who is a form three pupil, said she had since dropped out of school since she can longer conceal her pregnancy and is yet to be a father, but I’m ready to take care of the baby. Her parents are proving to be difficult since they don’t want me near her.</aside>
      <p>The minor has since dropped out of school and doctors said it was possible that one could get pregnant whilst a virgin.</p>
