        <b>Now that our midfield is established, we need to add a dash of flair to this Chiskop juggernaut. Players blessed with pace, skill, and trickery are the ones who light up the field and leave us stunned in amazement. In Mzansi, we certainly have no shortage of wildly talented players, and that’s why we’ve chosen Mark Mayambela as our Chiskop left-winger. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Scroll through the gallery above to view pics of Mayambela </i>
      </p>
      <p>At the tender age of 20, Mayambela moved to Bloemfontein Celtic in 2007. It was at Siwelele where he first displayed his wonderful talent.</p>
      <p>In the famous Green and White, the Chiskop made 49 appearances. With three goals and five assists, including a stunning free-kick against Kaizer Chiefs in 2009, Orlando Pirates came calling, and he transferred to the Buccaneers in 2010.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Chiskop Champion at Pirates</b>
      </p>
      <p>At Pirates, the Chiskop winger found great form, despite not being a regular starter. As a two-time Absa Premiership title and MTN8 winner during the 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons respectively, in his three years at the club, he assisted three times in 33 appearances.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Chiskop goes abroad</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the Chiskop had done well in the PSL, many in the local football fraternity were surprised when Swedish outfit, Djurgardens IF, signed Mayambela from Pirates. Unfortunately, his time abroad was characterized by injury, hampering his progress at the club. After a year in Sweden, making 31 appearances, with three goals and six assists, he returned to Mzansi.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mayambela becomes a journeyman</b>
      </p>
      <p>Once back in South Africa, the dribbling wizard had short stints at SuperSport United, Mpumalanga Black Aces, and Royal Eagles.</p>
      <p>This was followed by the first of his two spells at Chippa United. In the 2015/16 season, he made 11 appearances, scoring twice and assisting once.</p>
      <p>A season later, Mayambela returned home to join Ajax Cape Town. At the Urban Warriors, the Chiskop played some of his best football and took on more responsibility as a leader within the squad. After a good season in the Cape, making 24 appearances, scoring three times and assisting twice, he returned to the Chilli Boys, this time, as club captain.</p>
      <p>In his second spell at the Port Elizabeth-based club, he led the team to PSL stability, finishing 10<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> in the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons respectively. He made 48 appearances, assisting three goals and scoring five himself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Settled in City</b>
      </p>
      <p>Currently at Cape Town City, ‘Professor’, as he is affectionately known, is loving life and football in the Mother City, as he enters into the twilight of his career.</p>
      <p>
