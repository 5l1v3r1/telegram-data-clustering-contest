      <p>In Disney's <i>Frozen 2</i>, Elsa and her loved ones go on a quest to the edge of the known world after the awakening forces of elemental magic threaten to destroy the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, <a href="https://screenrant.com/frozen-2-how-elsa-die-survive-explained/">Elsa confronts the mysteries of her own powers</a> as well as the history of her family and their impact on the world around them.</p>
      <p>As dramatic and dangerous as the events are, it's not all serious twists and turns. The film finds plenty of laughs, largely through the more lighthearted adventures of Kristoff and the goofy observations of Olaf as he learns more about life. In fact, the film's single post-credits sequence leans into that sense of humor.</p>

      <p>Neither Elsa nor Anna makes an appearance in the sequence, which doesn't expand on the larger story or character arcs. Instead, the scene follows up on a solid running gag.</p>
      <p>After making their way into the enchanted forest, Elsa and the rest of the group encounter Mattias and other Arendelle soldiers, still alive after all these years. The soldiers have an uneasy peace with the Northerners, all of whom have spent the past few decades trapped in the forest by a mysterious mist. Because of their circumstances, they've been completely out of the loop when it comes to the outside world. To catch everyone up on the events that led Elsa and the others to enter the forest, Olaf performs a quick reenactment of the original <i>Frozen</i>, complete with musical numbers. The entire time, Matthias is completely absorbed, reacting with excitement and tears. He even gasps in shock when Hans betrays Anna.</p>

      <p>The post-credits sequence is a similar comedy beat, featuring Olaf recapping the events of <i>Frozen 2</i>. In the caves on the island where Elsa fully connected with magic, Olaf recounts everything that happened from his perspective to a collection of other sentient snowmen (including Marshmallow, the hulking guardian Elsa created for her castle in the previous film).</p>
      <p>This means, however, that Olaf misses some key details because he wasn't there for Elsa's biggest moments of self-discovery. He wasn't even there when Anna got the Earth Giants to destroy the structure keeping everyone trapped in the forest. During his recap, he skips that entire section of the story and jumps to the happy ending. The sequence ends with the group cheering for the story, glad that it all worked out. While it's not a crucial scene, it is a cute button on the film and worth checking out.</p>
