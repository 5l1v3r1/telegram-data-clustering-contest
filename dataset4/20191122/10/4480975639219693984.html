      <p>The USD/JPY pair traded with a mild negative bias through the early European session on Friday, albeit remained confined well within a three-day-old trading range around mid-108.00s.<br/> <br/>Given that the pair has repeatedly failed to find acceptance above the very important 200-day SMA, the bias seems tilted in favour of bearish traders and support prospects for further declines.<br/> <br/>The near-term negative outlook is further reinforced by the fact that the pair has been drifting lower along a descending trend-line, which should keep a lid on any attempted recovery move.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> haven't been supportive of any firm direction and warrant some caution before placing any aggressive bearish bets amid mixed trade headlines.<br/> <br/>Conversely, a sustained move beyond the trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, currently near the 108.80 region and a subsequent breakthrough the 109.00 handle (200-DMA) might negate the bearish bias.</p>
