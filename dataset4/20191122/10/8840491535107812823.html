      <p>The Saolta University Health Care Group has published the outcome of the options appraisal process undertaken to identify the most appropriate way to proceed with the future development of hospital services in Galway to enable the delivery of the best possible outcomes for patients across the west and north west.</p>
      <p>The process involved an extensive external assessment and options appraisal process conducted by KPMG /AECOM and Scott Tallon Walker Architects.</p>
      <p>This included an in-depth analysis of existing infrastructure on both the University Hospital Galway (UHG) and Merlin Park University Hospital (MPUH) sites with a detailed study of current and future demand for both local and specialist health service requirements in the region.</p>
      <p>Saolta Group CEO Tony Canavan stated: “The options appraisal process concluded that the preferred longer term option for the Model 4 hospital, to allow it adequately meet the needs of the very large geographic region it serves, is to develop a new fit-for-purpose 1,150 bed acute hospital on the Merlin Park University Hospital site.</p>
      <p>“The Model 4 hospital will lead to improvements in the health of over 800,000 people across the West/North West of Ireland serving patients from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim as well as Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</p>
      <p>“It will provide treatment options closer to home to the 14,000 patients who travel to Dublin every year and is fundamental to the efficient patient flow and regional access from other Saolta hospitals.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Pat Nash, Saolta Group Chief Clinical Director, added: “We made the decision to undertake this very detailed and complex analysis to ensure that the west and north eest region has a Model 4 hospital that meets best practice standards both now and into the future, to enable delivery of the best possible outcomes for our patients.</p>
      <p>“The recommendation to develop a new acute hospital on the Merlin Park site followed a comprehensive analysis of current facilities which determined that the majority of infrastructure across both sites was unacceptable to provide the models of care that will be necessary in the future. “Specifically, 64% and 95% of the infrastructure in UHG and MPUH respectively is ‘not satisfactory/unacceptable’ for its current function.</p>
      <p>“The options appraisal process also included a detailed demand and capacity analysis including an assessment of the current demand for services and the projected future demand to 2031.</p>
      <p>“It concluded that even with significant support from primary care and implementing ambitious efficiency targets, given Galway University Hospitals’ status as the tertiary referral for the region and its status as the regional cancer centre, significant growth is forecast between now and 2031.”</p>
      <p>As part of the options appraisal process a Regional Elective Hospital Scoping Study for the development of a Regional Elective Hospital in Galway was also undertaken.</p>
      <p>This outlines capacity, including the infrastructural requirements, necessary to develop an elective hospital which will serve the wider region.</p>
      <p>This is one of the key health projects approved by government in the Project Ireland 2040 plan published last year and the HSE Capital Plan published in 2019.</p>
      <p>The Scoping Study concludes that the most appropriate location for a regional elective hospital is also on the Merlin Park University Hospital site.</p>
