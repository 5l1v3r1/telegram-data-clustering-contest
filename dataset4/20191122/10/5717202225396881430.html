      <p>Aston Villa are reportedly considering a move to sign free agent Nico Gaitan after the Argentina international’s contract with MLS side Chicago Fire expired – and Villa fans have reacted on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Gaitan, 31, joined Chicago Fire after a brief spell in the Chinese Super League with Dalian Yifang. He scored four goals but more importantly laid on an impressive 11 assists for the MLS side. Now, he is on the lookout for a new club.</p>
      <p>With the MLS season beginning in February and finishing towards the end of the year, Gaitan is contracted at Fire until December 31 but is able to speak to clubs and will be able to sign for a new team in the January transfer window.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/21/nicolas-gaitan-west-ham-aston-villa-free-agent">The Guardian have claimed</a> that Villa are interested in signing the 19-time Argentina cap, but face plenty of Premier League competition from Sheffield United and West Ham United. The latter are believed to have opened talks to sign the player.</p>
      <p>Villa do have options out wide, after completing a permanent move for Anwar El Ghazi from Lille in the summer. Trezeguet joined from Turkish side Kasimpasa, while Jota has been in and out of the side after his move from Brentford.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa fans reacted to the reported news that their club could be about to sign Benfica icon Gaitan, would be an excellent signing on a free transfer. The majority want him to join, while some others are concerned.</p>
