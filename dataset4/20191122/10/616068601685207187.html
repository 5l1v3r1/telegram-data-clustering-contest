      <p>The opioid crisis in B.C. affects people from all walks of life in the community, and next week, a UBC Okanagan student will be training people how to stop an overdose.</p>
      <p>Ariel Smith, a medical student at UBCO, is hosting a free naloxone training workshop at the Kelowna university on Monday, to help educate people about how naloxone works.</p>
      <p>The medication, when injected, can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.</p>
      <p>“Through conversations with family and friends, I recognized a huge knowledge gap still existed in our community,” said Smith. “Especially, considering the majority of opioid overdose deaths in B.C. happen to people living inside a private residence.”</p>
      <p>Smith recently implemented naloxone training as part of the Faculty of Medicine's flexible and enhanced learning course.</p>
      <p>Prior to entering the medical program, Smith volunteered with HOPE Outreach, a local organization that supports exploited women in downtown Kelowna and Vernon. Through her work with HOPE, she trained many of the Okanagan's most vulnerable people how to use naloxone.</p>
      <p>She now offers free training sessions to businesses and volunteer organizations, in partnership with the outreach.</p>
      <p>“There is still a large stigma associated with opioids and naloxone training,” Smith said. “In our workshops, we create a safe learning environment for people to ask questions, learn to recognize the signs of an overdose and practise with real equipment.”</p>
      <p>The UBC Okanagan event will be held at the Reichwald Health Sciences Centre in Room RHS260 at 6 p.m.</p>
