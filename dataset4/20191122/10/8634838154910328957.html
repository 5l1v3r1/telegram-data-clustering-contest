      <h1>Larry Madowo Blasts New York Times For Biased Kenyan Article</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:54:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Mbataru</a></address>

        <b>Former BBC Africa business editor, Larry Madowo, on Friday, November 22, expressed his disgust at a business feature published by the New York Times centred on Kenya.  </b>
      </p>
      <p>Madowo, who took a career break to take up a fellowship opportunity at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, faulted the reporter for ignoring Kenyan contextual nuances in sourcing the story.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Twitter account, Madowo described the article as a blatant act of erasing Kenyans from their own country, a point he illustrated by the number of non-back Kenyans quoted in the report.</p>
      <p>“The New York Times published a story about fashion in Kenya's richest suburb by a white writer &amp; white photographer. Black Kenyans quoted - 0, obligatory tribal references - 2, white women quoted - 6,” read Madowo's incensed tweet.</p>

      <p>Larry put to task the author of the article, Ginanne Brownell Mitic, accusing her of ignoring the locals in the area the story emanated from.</p>
      <p>The article in reference was titled <i>'A Nairobi Neighborhood Ablaze With Color, Design and Creativity', </i>was accompanied by a blurb that read 'High-end stores merge the latest in design with works from tribal cultures.'</p>
      <p>"And what does ‘tribal cultures’ mean exactly? Is it shorthand for non-white?" Larry wondered. </p>
      <p>Nudged by Madowo, Kenyans weighed in on the ensuing conversation with a majority agreeing with Madowo's sentiments.</p>
      <p>@Guyo Golo Adhi wrote;</p>
      <p>“Similar scripts with Nat Geo sending photographers from NY to come and cover the Samburu lifestyle. Laughable.”</p>
      <p>Irene NM wrote;</p>
      <p>“Given a chance the New York Times would quote Karen Blixen. Their African correspondents need to take a course in decolonisation before writing any article on the land. They romanticise us and are still stuck in pre-colonial writing.”</p>
      <p>“Larry you are doing a good job, saying it as it is, they pretend to know our culture and heritage more than us.” wrote one <i>Pitosh Mkenya.</i></p>

      <p>Another user, Owiyo Erick, said;</p>
      <p>“The New York Times is a scam. They will never say anything good African without a link to their colonial mind reporting.”</p>
      <p>“At least they had a decent photo of Philis Murage, I think the story is okay... If only NYT didn’t have a reputation of having different standards for blacks as evidenced in Dusit attack, this story wouldn’t have been an issue,” wrote <i>Ngumba Kimani</i>.</p>
      <p>However other netizens seemed to differ with Larry on his opinion.</p>
      <p>Ian Cox wrote;</p>
      <p>"The article is about fashion in Karen. How many black Kenyan fashion designers are based or have shops in Karen?"</p>
      <p>Rebbeca Kiarie wrote;</p>
      <p>"But there's a black lady in the photo!!! What more could you possibly need?"</p>
      <p>"This is the equivalent of a white American journalist complaining about Chams Report, "Daring Abroad" that it only features black Kenyans in its shows." Roney Ngala wrote.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time Kenyans have been at loggerheads with the international publishers over condescending news coverage.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the January 2019 <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/36029-6-killed-dusit-d2-hotel-attack">Dusit D2 terrorist attack</a>, the  New York Times published a graphic image of the victims from the attack, something that sparked outrage in Kenya over the ethical considerations by the publisher.</p>
      <p>The publication, however, justified its action claiming the decision was reached to give its readers a 'clear picture of the horror of an attack like this'. </p>
      <p>"We want to be respectful to the victims and to others affected by the attack. But we also believe it is important to give our readers a clear picture of the horror of an attack like this. This includes showing pictures that are not sensationalised but that give a real sense of the situation," a statement by the publication read.</p>
