      <h1>Ind vs Ban Day-Night Test: Ishant-led pace battery wreaks havoc</h1>
      <h2>The pink ball proved to be a killer weapon for the pacers as Bangladesh’s batsmen didn’t show any intent for survival.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:03:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Y-B-Sarangi-1158/" target="_blank">Y.B. Sarangi</a></address>
      <p>The Indians enjoyed the challenge of the pink ball, adapted effortlessly and put up an emphatic performance in their day-night Test debut.</p>
      <p>Asked to bowl on a dry track, India’s world-class pace battery bundled out Bangladesh for 106 in less than three hours. Then, aided by disciplined half-centuries from captain Virat Kohli and Cheteshawar Pujara, scored 174 for three at the close of the opening day’s play at the Eden Gardens here on Friday. </p>
      <p>Wriddhiman Saha’s words about the Indian seamers prior to the match turned out to be prophetic. They grew in confidence after about half-an-hour and wreaked havoc on Bangladesh in front of their Primer Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
      <h3>Lovely rhythm</h3>
      <p>Ishant showcased lovely rhythm, chose the right areas and extracted fine movement off the surface to be the first from the country to take a pink five-for — his first at home in 12 years.</p>
      <p>Bowling round the wicket to the left-handed opening duo, Ishant looked effective right from the start. He mixed his stock deliveries with ones that cut into the southpaws. </p>
      <p>The lanky Delhi bowler became the first Indian to take a wicket with the pink ball, when Imrul Kayes was trapped in front playing across, soon after using the DRS lifeline to survive a caught behind decision.</p>
      <p>Umesh Yadav then changed ends to deal a double blow. </p>
      <p>Rohit Sharma, who had practised taking sharp catches prior to the match, leaped to his right to remove skipper Mominul Haque and give Umesh his first scalp. Mithun inside-edged an incoming delivery.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Shami extracted massive lateral movement, but benefited by sticking to the target. He drifted the ball slightly to see Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladesh’s top-scorer in the first Test, playing on. </p>
      <p>The visiting batsmen made things easier for the host with their lack of footwork. Opener Shadman Islam (29) became Wriddhiman Saha’s 100th dismissal and Umesh’ third victim. </p>
      <p>Mahmudullah poked at Ishant’s away-going delivery to be spectacularly held by Saha in front of first slip as Bangladesh was reduced to 60 for six inside 20 overs.</p>
      <p>A defiant Liton Das displayed his compact game, but his innings was cut short rather unfortunately. Liton, who missed a pull shot off Shami and was hit on the helmet on 15, shrugged off the blow to play a few lovely boundaries, complained of some discomfort in the next over when umpires called for supper with Bangladesh at 73 for six.</p>
      <p>Under the concussion rule, Liton (24) was replaced by all-rounder Mehidy Hasan. Off-break bowler Nayeem Hasan (19), also hit by a Shami bouncer, was also substituted by spinner Taijul Islam due to concussion.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, both Mehidy and Taijul had been dropped from the playing XI at the toss.</p>
      <p>As lights were switched on in the second session, sighting the pink ball seemed to become an issue. </p>
      <p>Ishant, egged on by an enthusiastic crowd, uprooted Nayeem and Ebadot Hossain’s off stumps and had Mehidy caught at short-cover.</p>
      <p>Pujara lapping up a fumbled catch by Rohit in the slips ended the Bangladesh innings.</p>
      <p>Mayank Agarwal and Rohit began confidently, but could not convert their starts. </p>
      <p>Pujara and Kohli applied themselves in the unfamiliar setting and put up a determined 94-run partnership for the third wicket to put India on top.</p>
      <p>Pujara drove, cut and played his trademark wristy shots on the onside to pick up eight fours in his 21st half-century (55, 105 balls). He was caught at second slip trying to negotiate unexpected bounce from an Ebadot delivery.</p>
      <h3>Kohli in good nick</h3>
      <p>Kohli (59 not out) solidly defended deliveries that deserved respect and drove beautifully to collect most of his runs down the ground and in the cover region.</p>
      <p>A gorgeous pull off Ebadot brought up his 50. He stood firm with his deputy Ajinkya Rahane (23 not out) till the end.</p>
