      <p>David was in a relationship with Maya but had no idea what she was doing to his son.</p>
      <p>This week, as Jacob desperately tried to talk to Maya and tell her he loved her, Maya left prison, deleted Jacob's contact from her phone and viewers discovered <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-stunned-as-maya-returns-pregnant/">the former school teacher is pregnant.</a></p>

      <p>In Wednesday night's episode of the soap (November 20 2019) Jacob was upset as he hadn't heard from Maya since her release.</p>
      <p>He was soon joined by Leanna Cavanagh, Maya's former stepdaughter, who wanted to help her friend.</p>
      <p>However, one thing led to another and the teens ended up sleeping together.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, Jacob quickly made his excuses to leave, but was shocked to find out that it was Leanna's first time.</p>
      <p>Later when she returned home, Jacob texted her asking if she was on the pill.</p>
      <p>In Thursday night's episodes (November 21 2019), Leanna ended up confiding in her dad's girlfriend Bernice about what happened and asked her to get her the morning after pill but begged her not to tell Liam.</p>
      <p>But when Leanna ended up throwing up because of the emergency contraception, she was forced to come clean to her dad about what had happened.</p>

      <p>When she revealed that she only had sex with Jacob to prove she liked him, Liam got the wrong end of the stick.</p>
      <p>Over at David's shop, Liam accused Jacob of pressuring Leanna into sleeping with him and Jacob's words left viewers disgusted.</p>
      <p>Jacob said: "It's just sex, people do it all the time, it doesn't mean anything. That's why I left afterwards.</p>
      <p>"She wanted it more than me. I wasn't even that bothered."</p>

      <p>When Gabby asked Jacob if he pretended to like Leanna to get her into bed, Jacob said: "I didn't have to pretend, she was well up for it. Even though I'd never be into her.</p>
      <p>"I mean, look at her, she thinks she's so pretty but it's just a face full of make-up.</p>
      <p>But when Liam told Jacob that Leanna didn't want to have sex, Jacob called her a liar and said he didn't want her.</p>

      <p>He went onto say he just did "what any lad would do".</p>
      <p>When Liam warned him to stay away from Leanna, Jacob said: "Trust me, I won't be going anywhere near that again. The only reason I bothered was because she came looking for me and I thought why not?"</p>
      <p>Pushed too far, Liam ended up punching the teenager in the face, leaving him with a bloody lip.</p>
