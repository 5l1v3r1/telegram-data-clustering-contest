      <p>The comptroller-general of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, has threatened to sack any officer who acquires wealth illegally.</p>
      <p>Ali gave the warning while decorating some newly promoted officers of the service in Abuja on Friday.</p>
      <p>The service recently promoted 2,508 officers to various ranks and appointed three as members of its management.</p>
      <p>Ali said for customs officers to remain in service, they must avoid living above their earnings.</p>
      <p>He said every officer could survive within the remuneration package of the service, if well managed.</p>
      <p>“I will show the way out to any officer who thinks he can not survive with his remuneration but involve in illicit ways to acquire wealth,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I know the service gives you enough that you can survive with, it is just a question of prudence. You can never have everything you that you desire to acquire</p>
      <p>“You must prioritise your needs and by the time you do that, you will meet your needs.”</p>
      <p>The CG charged the newly promoted officers to be more committed and dedicated to their duties.</p>
      <p>He advised them to take their jobs seriously, be fair and firm in their decisions and actions.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the promoted officers, David Chikan, deputy comptroller-general thanked the management for elevating them.</p>
