      <h2>Charlie Nicholas looks ahead to Man City's clash with Chelsea FC in the Premier League on Saturday</h2>

      <h3>Charlie Nicholas is backing Manchester City to claim a dominant 4-2 victory over Chelsea FC in their Premier League clash at The Etihad on Saturday night.</h3>
      <p>The Citizens head into the game looking to get back to winning ways in the top flight after the disappointment of their 3-1 loss to Liverpool FC last time out.</p>
      <p>Manchester City are currently in fourth place in the Premier League table as they look to turn things around and get their title bid back on track.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC, meanwhile, have been in fine form in recent weeks and they currently find themselves in third place in the table after having won their last six games on the spin in the top flight.</p>
      <p>The Blues were 2-0 winners over Crystal Palace last time out and they will be looking to continue their fine form when they take on Pep Guardiola’s men this weekend.</p>
      <p>Arsenal legend Nicholas is expecting it to be an open game between the two sides, but he is ultimately tipping Manchester City to come out on top as the hosts.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a>, Nicholas said: “It is a belter of a game, mainly because Manchester City are in fourth – how could we have predicted that at this stage?</p>
      <p>“Chelsea are above them with the youngsters, who have all gone on international duty during the break, and have been scoring. It is the ideal scenario really, almost perfect.</p>
      <p>“N’Golo Kante is back fit and in the side, while Willian is playing well. Cesar Azpilicueta has revived himself and is back to his old self.</p>
      <p>“Marcos Alonso has been alright when he has played and the centre-backs have been great – it looks promising to Chelsea. Frank Lampard will come up with a puzzle for City, but his puzzle will focus on the fact that Pep Guardiola’s team are really struggling at the back and Chelsea have pace and technically-gifted players up front.</p>
      <p>“It is going to be an open game, so Jorginho and Kante may have to sit deeper than they have been so far this season. I think Chelsea need to stay in the game for 70 minutes or so and then look to adapt to the situation if possible.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know who Pep will pick because they are so frail in defence at the moment. It would be a gigantic blow if Ederson was to miss out and I do think City will want to simply go and beat Chelsea and get the job done with three points – it will up the ante on Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“The title race is far from over. Liverpool are in a great position but within three or four games over the festive period they could draw three times and suddenly the title race would be back on – they did it last year.</p>
      <p>“For that reason, I think it will be Man City’s day, but it will be such an open game that it will be a treat for everyone watching.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City are aiming to defend their Premier League title this season but they already find themselves nine points behind leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
