      <h1>Jose Mourinho will transform Tottenham but fans told to compromise on one thing</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been a major talking point after becoming the new boss of Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Chris Waddle has explained how he believes <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> will go about transforming Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Mourinho replaced <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> at <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> this week after the latter was sacked following five years at the club.</p>
      <p>A poor start to the Premier League season which has Tottenham in 14th was enough to end a brilliant journey under the Argentine that included four top-four finishes and a Champions League final appearance.</p>
      <p>Now Waddle feels that Mourinho will completely shake things up at Spurs and bring a new identity to the club, whether the fans and players like it or not.</p>
      <p>"I’m not sure I’d have enjoyed playing under him and that’s an issue that is clearly bugging Tottenham fans," Waddle told the Racing Post.</p>
      <p>"He’s not going to go toe-to-toe with City or Liverpool, so he’ll park the bus and try to hit them on the break. But then he’ll attack other opponents very differently.</p>
      <p>"I remember seeing games in his second stint at Chelsea and also at United where his teams were brilliant to watch. And there were other times when they were dire.</p>
      <p>"All the football Spurs have played down the years, even when I was there, was about risk. It was ‘wow’ football and when it came off it was unbelievable and when it didn’t it was awful. He’ll cut the risk out of it.</p>

      <p>"This is a meticulous manager who will treat every game differently with the long-term goal of winning trophies. And if they do start winning cups but the football isn’t great to watch then he won’t care less and nor will the board. That’s why they’ve taken him there."</p>
