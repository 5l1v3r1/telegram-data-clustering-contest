      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:05:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:05</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Carson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/callum-carson/</a></address>
      <p>West Lothian Paralympic athlete Stephen Payton has spoken of his pride at being inducted into the Scottish Athletics Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, who lives in Torphichen, will be one of four Para athletes inducted on Saturday night as Scottish Athletics celebrates a career that included nine Paralympic Games and 10 World Championships medals.</p>
      <p>His 400m T38 time of 51.37 is still a European record 25 years later.</p>
      <p>The former Inveralmond High School pupil, who has cerebral palsy, sat down with the Courier this week to reflect on a long and storied career that started out after a fun run alongside his sister Karen as an 11-year-old.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m incredibly proud to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. It wasn’t something I had thought about at all.</p>
      <p>“To be one of the first Paralympians inducted is a wonderful honour.</p>
      <p>“I competed in a fun run alongside my sister as an 11-year-old and really enjoyed it but it wasn’t until I was 15 that I started competing properly at Livingston Athletic Club.</p>
      <p>“I was involved in able-bodied athletics at Livingston before I then became involved in Paralympic athletics.”</p>
      <p>He added: “My dad was doing an officiating course in 1992 and ended up being put in the same room as the national coach for disability athletics.</p>
      <p>“They got chatting and that’s when I was told that if I took it seriously and dedicated myself I could be successful.</p>
      <p>“That was the point where it clicked and I saw that there was an opportunity for me. From that point it was doubling my training and seeking out the best coaches and sports scientists.</p>
      <p>“I saw an opportunity but could never have imagined it would lead to a 16-year career, including 10 as a full-time athlete, and so many Paralympic and World Championship medals. I did pretty well out of it.”</p>
      <p>That is certainly an understatement. He clinched gold in the T37 100m, 200m and 400m alongside a bronze in the 4x100m relay at the 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Four years later he tallied silvers in the T38 400m and 4x100m relay as well as bronze medals for the T38 100m and 200m.</p>
      <p>However, he describes the bronze medal that he won at the 2004 Games in Athens in the 400m as the most special in his career.</p>
      <p>He said: “Coming back from a broken ankle just nine months out from the Athens Games and then being able to get a bronze medal was the one medal that means the most to me.</p>
      <p>“It was on my dominant side. I have cerebral palsy on my left side and broke my right ankle so it was a real challenge.</p>
      <p>“To be able to get myself back and compete and get a medal at the Paralympics given all of that was special.</p>
      <p>“The Paralympics were evolving and getting better all the time so to be in a cast and crutches nine months before my third Games and get a bronze medal gives me a huge sense of satisfaction.”</p>
      <p>While his bronze in Athens ranks as his most special medal, he says being able to soak up the atmosphere of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin as a doe-eyed 17-year-old competing in the World Championships for the first time is the one moment of his career that had the greatest impact.</p>
      <p>“My first big international event was the World Championships in Berlin in 1994, which was a phenomenal experience,” he said.</p>
      <p>“For a 17-year-old to be competing in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin with all the history it has from the 1936 Olympics with Jesse Owens was breathtaking.</p>
      <p>“It’s still something that is etched in my brain.</p>
      <p>“I realised quite quickly just how big a deal it was to be competing in that venue and at the international stage.</p>
      <p>“It was the first time I’d competed for Great Britain and it was my first World Championships.</p>
      <p>“Our accommodation was actually in East Berlin and it wasn’t that far removed from the Berlin Wall being knocked down and we had to travel through the Brandenburg Gate into West Berlin to compete every day.</p>
      <p>“It was like chalk and cheese travelling between the two.</p>
      <p>“It was a unique and historic time to be there and even as a 17-year-old, competing on the big stage for the first time, it wasn’t lost on me just how special it was to be there.”</p>
      <p>Paralympic sport has changed greatly since Stephen first got involved and it was not until midway through his career that he was able to be a full-time athlete.</p>
      <p>Despite that, he is confident that he got the best out of his talent and is delighted that today’s Paralympic stars are on a level playing field with their able-bodied peers.</p>
      <p>He said: “There was a huge transition with Paralympic sports while I was competing. In my first Paralympic Games I still had a full-time job and had to pay to go there.</p>
      <p>“Making a living and having a career as a full-time Paralympic athlete wasn’t something that existed.</p>
      <p>“In the middle of my career, UK Sport and the Lottery funding came on board and that enabled that transition and allowed me to concentrate on my athletics career.</p>
      <p>“I became a full-time athlete for 10 years so I think I had a good run at it and it was exciting to be part of it all when Paralympic sports really started to get the kudos and become bigger and bigger every year.</p>
      <p>“I think we’re at the stage now where Paralympic athletes are on par with Olympic athletes in terms of funding and access to the best training and staff and that’s where it should be.</p>
      <p>“I don’t look back and wish I was 10 years younger so I could benefit from that, though, and I’m especially proud of the fact that my best 400m time would have been good enough for silver at the recent World Championships.</p>
      <p>“I think my times would still be competitive in the 400m now but it’s also great to see just how far Paralympic sports has come since I started my career.”</p>
