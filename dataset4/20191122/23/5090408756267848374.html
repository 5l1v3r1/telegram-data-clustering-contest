      <p>Amazon Web Services is reportedly cracking down on letting its partners even mention that cloud computing services from other providers exist.</p>
      <p>At its New York conference in July, Amazon reportedly blocked partners with booths from mentioning its competitors like Microsoft and Google Cloud, the <i>New York Post’s</i> <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/amazon-made-sure-cloud-competitors-werent-mentioned-at-annual-conference/">Nicolas Vega reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Partners at that conference who did mention competitors were asked to remove those names or cover them up with tape, The Post’s Vega reported.</p>
      <p>Likewise, AWS released a branding guide that said AWS would not approve terms like “multi-cloud,” “cross cloud,” “any cloud,” “every cloud,” “or any other language that implies designing or supporting more than one cloud provider,” <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-forbids-partners-even-mentioning-multi-cloud-529598">CRN’s Brendan Foye reported</a>. These phrases suggest that customers can use other clouds in addition to that of Amazon’s.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if AWS has imposed similar rules at any of its other conferences. AWS did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>
      <p>While AWS is still considered the number one cloud, its rivals Microsoft and Google Cloud are working to gain a slice of that market. Just October, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jedi-microsoft-amazon-web-services-fulfill-contract-2019-10">Microsoft</a> scored <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wins-10-billion-jedi-contract-with-the-pentagon-2019-10">a major upset</a> over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-lost-jedi-cloud-contract-microsoft-2019-10">AWS</a> when it won the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Earlier this month, AWS <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-challenges-microsoft-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract-win-2019-11">filed a protest</a> over Microsoft’s victory.</p>
