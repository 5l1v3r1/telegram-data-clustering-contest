      <p>Britain’s opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has confirmed that he will take a “neutral stance” in a second Brexit referendum if he becomes prime minister.</p>
      <p>It follows mounting pressure to say which side he would take in the confirmatory poll that his Labour party proposes.</p>
      <p>Labour, which on Thursday unveiled a manifesto brimming with public spending pledges, says it will negotiate a new Brexit deal with the European Union and put the outcome to a second national vote.</p>
      <p>Corbyn said he would “be an honest broker and not campaign for either side in the final say referendum.”</p>
      <p>The announcement came in a BBC debate hosted by Fiona Bruce in which leaders of the four main parties answered questions from a studio audience.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson was challenged about his government’s refusal to publish a report into Russian interference in British politics, but his answers were dismissed by the audience.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Brexit Party, led by anti-EU Nigel Farage, published a list of policy pledges in its manifesto.</p>
      <p>The party is running in almost 300 seats but has withdrawn from 317 Conservative-held constituencies to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>Farage urged voters to give his party lawmakers in Parliament so they could pressure the government for a hard Brexit in which Britain wouldn’t remain aligned to EU rules and standards.</p>
      <p>“Without us, there will be no genuine Brexit,” he said.</p>
