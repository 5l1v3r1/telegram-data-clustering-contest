      <h1>Oklahoma vs. TCU: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:04:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>The No. 9 Oklahoma Sooners need to start really impressing people to get into the College Football Playoff picture. Lincoln Riley’s team hosts TCU in Norman tomorrow evening.</p>
      <p>Despite being a one-loss conference favorite with plenty of playoff history, the Sooners’ placement in the latest <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">College Football Playoff rankings</a> after a comeback win over previously undefeated Baylor on the road shouldn’t give fans much faith. One-loss Georgia, Alabama, Oregon, Utah, and Penn State teams all stand between Oklahoma and the top four.</p>
      <p>Some of those teams are destined to lose, but it will be hard for Oklahoma to jump all of them, if its possible at all. Either way, the Sooners should be plenty motivated to end the season.</p>
      <p>TCU is just 5-5 on the year, with a 3-4 Big 12 record. The Horned Frogs’ biggest win of the year came against Texas a few weeks ago, but that doesn’t hold up as well as they probably thought it would, as UT has fallen off.</p>
      <p>Gary Patterson’s team has been very competitive in its losses though. The only one of its five losses that came by more than one score was a 49-24 at the hands of Iowa State in Ames. The other four have come by a combined 23 points.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma blew out TCU in 2018, winning 52-27 in Fort Worth. This series has been very one-sided since the Horned Frogs joined the Big 12, with TCU winning one game in those eight seasons, in 2014 when the team finished just outside the College Football Playoff. The Sooners are 14-5 all-time in this game.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, style points matter, and if Oklahoma wants any shot of getting back into the Playoff picture, it will need to make a statement over the next three weeks.</p>
      <p>The Sooners follow this game up with Bedlam against Oklahoma State, followed by the Big 12 Championship Game, which looks like a rematch with Baylor, though those two spots have not been decided.</p>
