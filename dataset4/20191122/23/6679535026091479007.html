      <p>A Goa court on Friday granted bail to suspended swimming coach Surajit Ganguly accused of raping a minor girl in September this year.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ganguly, employed at the time with Goa Swimming Association, was accused of rape by a 15-year-old girl training under him.</p>
      <p>The girl’s father had filed a case in Rishra police station in Hooghly district of West Bengal, after which the case was transferred to Mapusa in Goa where the complainant said the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ganguly was arrested in New Delhi in September and is at present in judicial custody.</p>
      <p>While granting him bail, Goa Children’s Court president Vijaya Ambre on Friday directed him to cooperate in the probe.</p>
      <p>Mapusa police filed a charge sheet in the case earlier this month, after which Mr. Ganguly moved the children’s court for bail last week.</p>
      <p>He has been accused of rape under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Goa Children’s Act.</p>
