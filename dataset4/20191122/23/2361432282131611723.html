      <h1>Graham Norton to Host 2020 BAFTA Film Awards</h1>
      <h2>The British ceremony takes place on Feb. 2 at London’s Royal Albert Hall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:39:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/brian-welk/" target="_blank">Brian Welk</a></address>
      <p>Graham Norton is set to host the 2020 BAFTA film awards, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts announced Friday.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will be held at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday Feb. 2, and will feature a performance from Cirque du Soleil. Norton is taking over from “Absolutely Fabulous” actress Joanna Lumley, who hosted the awards for the past two years.</p>
      <p>While the British late night host of “The Graham Norton Show” has a long history with the BAFTA Television Awards, having won six of the prizes over the years among 19 nominations that Norton and his shows have racked up, this will mark his debut as the host of the event, which is officially named the EE British Academy Film Awards.</p>

      <p>“I’m delighted to be taking the helm of the biggest night in British Film, the audience at the Royal Albert Hall will be the biggest sofa I’ve ever faced. I’m honored to be following in the fabulous footsteps of Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley,” Norton said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“I am absolutely delighted that Graham Norton will host the EE British Academy Film Awards on Sunday Feb. 2, 2020. He will bring his brilliance and unique brand of humor to the role,” Amanda Berry OBE, chief executive of BAFTA said in a statement. “The Film Awards is transmitted around the world, and those audiences know him too.

          <figcaption>While some filmmakers get their starts making cheaply made B-movies or horror films, there's a new crop of directors emerging who previously cut their teeth making classic comedies. And while most haven't abandoned their sense of humor entirely, they've finally been recognized at both the box office and awards circuit by veering into prestige pictures. The latest example is Todd Phillips, the director of "Joker," which as the darkly disturbed origin story of the iconic Batman villain is no laughing matter. Here are some other directors who have re-emerged as more than just funny men.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Jay Roach - Comedy Classic: "Austin Powers"/Dramatic Turn: "Trumbo"<br/></b>Jay Roach helmed not one but two comedy franchises before turning into something of a political wonk and directing the TV movie "Recount" in 2008 about the infamous 2000 election debacle in Florida. He told <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/06/talking-to-jay-roach-about-austin-powers-meet-the-parents-and-directing-big-budget-comedies.html">Vulture</a> that he always admired the directors who find the grey area between comedy and drama like Alexander Payne and Hal Ashby. "Movies that have so much pain and angst yet fully committed humor. Those are the kind of movies I grew up on."<cite>Corina Marie Howell for TheWrap</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Adam McKay - Comedy Classic: "Anchorman"/Dramatic Turn: "The Big Short"<br/></b>Movies like "The Big Short" and "Vice" are rooted in comedy and satire because of McKay's intention to capture the absurdity and complexity of a crazy time in recent political and economic history. McKay said in an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/magazine/adam-mckay-dick-cheney-vice.html">The New York Times Magazine</a> that he hopes his films capture that murky tone, and that he's not the only funny person suddenly wading into these waters. "We’re living in a world with a tone that none of us has ever experienced. Pipe bombs are being sent to the leaders of a political party, and the guy who made ‘Dilbert’ is saying, You know the bombs were really made by left-wingers because they didn’t work,” McKay said. <cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Tom Shadyac - Comedy Classic: "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"/Dramatic Turn: "Brian Banks"<br/></b>Despite being one of Hollywood's top comedy directors following Jim Carrey movies like "Ace Ventura," "Liar Liar" and "Bruce Almighty," Tom Shadyac found he couldn't get work in Hollywood after both the bomb of his 2007 film "Evan Almighty" and after he suffered a life threatening concussion in an accident. But he told the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2019-08-07/brian-banks-innocence-project-tom-shadyac-ace-ventura">LA Times</a> he found a new outlook on life and Hollywood in directing the story of "Brian Banks," a college football star wrongly convicted of a crime.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Todd Phillips - Comedy Classic: "The Hangover"/Dramatic Turn: "Joker"<br/></b>Todd Philips told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/joaquin-phoenix-cover-story">Vanity Fair</a> in support of "Joker" that he's left comedy filmmaking entirely after feeling that "woke" culture drove his bro comedies like "Old School," "Road Trip" and most notably "The Hangover" films out of style. "Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,” Philips said. “There were articles written about why comedies don’t work anymore—I’ll tell you why, because all the f---ing funny guys are like, ‘F--- this s---, because I don’t want to offend you.’ It’s hard to argue with 30 million people on Twitter. You just can’t do it, right? So you just go, ‘I’m out.’"<cite>Courtesy of Warner Bros.</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Peter Farrelly - Comedy Classic: "Dumb and Dumber"/Dramatic Turn: "Green Book"<br/></b>Yes, the guy who made "Dumb and Dumber" beat out "Roma" at the Oscars last year. And the tone between comedy and drama that director Peter Farrelly walks with "Green Book" helped his movie get made. Farrelly told <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/peter-farrelly-on-trading-comedy-for-drama-with-green-book.html">Vulture</a> he was able to pitch "Green Book" to studios based on the idea that a racial biopic is actually a buddy, road trip movie. And even though it deals with more dramatic fare, Farrelly still views his film as primarily lighter entertainment. “I’m sure there will be some criticism that [the film] is not authentic because it’s not dark enough,” Farrelly told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2018/11/30/peter-farrelly-green-book-interview-1211947.html">Newsweek</a>, “But that’s not my style.” Lighten up—it’s only a movie, right?<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Woody Allen - Comedy Classic: "Annie Hall"/Dramatic Turn: "Interiors"<br/></b>Woody Allen found himself winning Oscars when he went beyond zany farces like "Sleeper" and "Love and Death" to telling more relatable stories like "Annie Hall" that blended comedy, drama and romance. But the prolific director would immediately follow up his Best Picture winner with a strictly dramatic take in the style of Ingmar Bergman films with his 1978 movie "Interiors." Movies like "Another Woman" and "Blue Jasmine" have further shown Allen stepping out of his comedic comfort zone.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Preston Sturges - Comedy Classic: "The Lady Eve"/Dramatic Turn: "Sullivan's Travels"<br/></b>Preston Sturges, one of the signature directors of Old Hollywood, would likely still be admired today based solely on the success of his screwball comedies like "The Great McGinty" and "The Lady Eve." But he took a step up as an auteur with his 1941 more serious film "Sullivan's Travels." The film even breaks the fourth wall by telling an insider Hollywood story about a talented director who disguises himself as a hobo so he can learn about the true tragedies of the modern world for his next film, only to find he can't ever escape Hollywood and his pigeon-holed place in the business.<cite>Paramount Pictures</cite></figcaption>

In fact, Stiller was out of the country shooting "Zoolander 2" when the real life events of the series took place. While he's veered between more dramatic roles as an actor, he teased to CBS News that he might "possibly" be considering retirement from broad comedies altogether.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Paul Feig - Comedy Classic: "Bridesmaids"/Dramatic Turn: "A Simple Favor"<br/></b>Paul Feig certainly has not strayed from making comedies, but he felt the urge to tackle a Hitchcockian thriller with just a dash of comedic elements with his film "A Simple Favor." In an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/14/a-simple-favor-director-paul-feig/">EW</a>, he explained he's always tried to make genre films and finding the comedy within those tropes. "How do you walk that line where you can push the edge of the tone but you don’t spill over out of it so that you take the audience out of it? So this was definitely the biggest tonal tightrope," Feig told EW.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>David Dobkin - Comedy Classic: "Wedding Crashers"/Dramatic Turn: "The Judge"<br/></b>Though music videos and comedies allowed Dobkin to break into the industry, he had been plotting a pivot to drama with the Robert Downey Jr. film "The Judge" as far back as 2006 and before he began production on "Fred Claus," according to an interview with <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/interview-director-david_b_5970098">HuffPost</a>. However, his next film finds him squarely back in comedy with the Will Ferrell parody film "Eurovision."<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>
