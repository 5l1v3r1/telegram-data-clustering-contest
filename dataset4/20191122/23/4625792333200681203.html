      <p>New York City intentionally flooded an entrance to a Brooklyn subway stop for four hours to test a new "flex gate" that was installed in preparation for a devastating weather event caused by climate change.</p>
      <p>One commuter posted a photo of the G line Broadway Station in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Wednesday, along with a request for more information.</p>
      <p>"MTA explain yourself," wrote Kaye Blegvad to the Metropolitan Transit Authority.</p>
      <p>The NYC Transit Subway account responded to the request with a joke that it is changing to underwater transportation, saying, "We're pivoting to submarines."</p>

      <p>On a more serious tone, the account went on to explain that the flood was purposefully created as a test for a new sealant.</p>
      <p>"But actually, we were testing a new 'flex gate,' which is a flood barrier that would allow us to seal off a subway entrance," NYCT Subway said. "We 'test flood' the entrance for four hours to make sure it was installed correctly, which it was! We're doing this because climate change is real."</p>

      <p>Several Twitter users questioned the choice to run the test during the day when the subway entrance saw high levels of traffic. Others noted the other avenues in which water would be able to enter the station even if the entrances were sealed off.</p>
      <p>"I cant believe the mta plans to waste more money on these ideas," one user said. "Mta assumes the flooding will occur through the station entrance ONLY and not the millions of cracks, storm drains and the proven 'waterfalls' in the middle of the tracks... why dont you spend the money on drainage?"</p>
      <p>The Subway account conceded that the flex gate would not prevent flooding caused by heavy rain and was designed specifically to prevent storm surge. Referring to the catastrophic 2012 Hurricane Sandy, which caused an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cdbgdr/about/About%20Hurricane%20Sandy.page">estimated</a> $19 billion in damage and lost economic activity to New York City, the account elaborated on its goals.</p>
      <p>"Sandy did billions of dollars of damage (literally) so we're not taking any chances for the next one," the account said. "These devices are to prevent impacts from storm surge, not the kind of flooding we see during heavy rains. We're also protecting thousands of sidewalk vents (literally)."</p>

      <p>The New York City Subway system is the subject of consistent criticism from riders who assert that the mass transportation system is unreliable and in dire need of repair. The city announced a $54 billion <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-york-city-installing-subway-elevators-at-about-78-million-per-station">plan in September</a> to repair and improve the subway system. It was not immediately clear how much of that budget would be used to install flex gates.</p>
