      <p>An OAP had a 2.3 stone tumour removed 20 years after it started growing.</p>
      <p>The 80-year-old Russian woman had refused to get it looked at because she didn't believe in science - despite being unable to eat solid food.</p>
      <p>But she ended up being rushed for an emergency operation at Domodedovo City Hospital, just outside Moscow, after doctors spotted the tumour.</p>
      <p>Local media report she had been living with the tumour for two decades - but is a strict opponent of scientific medicine.</p>
      <p>Local media report as a cause of the tumour the woman could only eat pureed food as anything else would make her vomit and cause her to have stomach pains.</p>

      <p>She moved onto liquid foods like soup and broths as she was becoming constipated.</p>
      <p>She finally decided to call the hospital as she started gaining weight while only drinking water and not consuming anything else.</p>
      <p>The team of surgeons from the Domodedovo City Hospital removed a tumour weighing 15 kilogrammes (2.3 stone).</p>
      <p>Hospital chief, Andrey Osipov, said: "The woman was delivered to the hospital with acute intestinal obstruction. Checks showed a giant tumour in the woman's abdominal cavity."</p>

      <p>And 'Marina Gor' added: "This is so unbelievable gross."</p>
      <p>'Afanasiy Sirnbirnstein' wrote: "Oh boy, this woman had her tumour during the entire 20 years of Putin's rule over Russia."</p>
