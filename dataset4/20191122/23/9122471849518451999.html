      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Has Brutally Honest Response To SEC’s Schedule This Weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:09:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Friday afternoon, ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit sent out a tweet saying how excited he is for a major weekend of college football.</p>
      <p>“Nothing like CFB in November. Just when you think ya know the answers the underdogs change the question! Time of the yr where you can make assumptions &amp; yet the pressure gets excessive &amp; some teams can’t handle it-Expect the unexpected the next 2 weeks-Here we go!” Herbstreit said.</p>
      <p>A Michigan radio host weighed in calling out the SEC’s top teams playing weaker opponents this weekend.</p>
      <p>He noted the opponents of Alabama, Auburn and LSU who play Western Carolina, Samford and Arkansas.</p>
      <p>Herbie responded, noting he’s not happy with the schedules either.</p>
      <p>“Sucks,” he said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>LSU can’t be at fault here. It’s not the Tigers fault the Razorbacks have struggled so much in recent years. However, Alabama and Auburn knowingly scheduled easier opponents right before the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>It’s a smart move on their parts, ensuring the team will likely have a win and stay healthy in the process.</p>
      <p>However, college football fans have been unhappy with the SEC’s scheduling for years now. That’s not likely to change any time soon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in one of the biggest games of the season.</p>
