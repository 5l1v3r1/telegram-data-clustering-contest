      <h2>The pair weigh-in on Friday prior to their heavyweight rematch at the MGM Arena in Las Vegas, and they'll receive a decent sum of money for their time in the ring</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/luis-ortiz">Luis Ortiz</a> are each set to land a handsome figure for their world heavyweight title rematch on Saturday - which is only a portion of their expected earnings for the fight.</p>
      <p>Both fighters weighed in on Friday ahead of the bout at the MGM Arena in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The pair met in March last year, with Ortiz troubling the champion on a couple of occasions before Wilder secured a 10th round TKO win.</p>
      <p>Wilder is putting his WBC belt on the line again against Cuban Ortiz, and will collect double that of his opponent in purse fees.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28117649/ten-nba-things-like-including-electric-ja-morant">ESPN report</a> that Wilder will be paid $3million (about £2.3m) for the bout, while Ortiz will receive $1.5m (approx £1.1m).</p>

      <p>However that is just a fraction of their guaranteed earnings from the clash, with Wilder set to earn a minimum of $20m (£15.5m), while Ortiz gets $7m (£5.4m) in return.</p>
      <p>The figures dwarf that of their 2018 bout at the Barclays Center in New York, where Wilder earned a then-career high purse fee of $2.1m.</p>
      <p>Ortiz is also quids-in, having received $500,000 from the purses in that fight, just a third of what he is set to earn from Saturday's event.</p>

      <p>The bout is due to be screened live via pay-per-view on broadcasters PBC and Fox in the United States.</p>
      <p>Ortiz weighed-in at 236.5lbs on Friday, holding the slight advantage over Wilder, who tipped the scales at 219.5lbs.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old comes into the bout the underdog, although his loss to Wilder is the only defeat on his 34-bout record.</p>

      <p>Since then he has scored two knockout wins, as well as a unanimous points victory over Christian Hammer.</p>
      <p>Wilder meanwhile is unbeaten in 42 bouts, with all-but one of his 41 wins coming by knockout.</p>
      <p>His only blemish is a controversial draw with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> , while his most recent fight was a first round defeat of Dominic Breazeale.</p>
      <p>Wilder said: "He knows what happened the first time, he knows what's going to happen the second time. I'm going to have no mercy on him.</p>
      <p>"Just don't blink baby, it's going to be an amazing fight."</p>
      <p>Ortiz added: "There's nothing more to talk about. Tomorrow's our night."</p>
