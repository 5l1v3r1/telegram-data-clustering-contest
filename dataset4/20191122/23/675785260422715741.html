      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Ian Wright 'looks close to quitting' fear fans</h1>
      <h2>Former Arsenal and England legend Ian Wright is finding his I'm A Celebrity adventure tough going as hunger pains are starting to dominate his wellbeing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:43:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Ian Wright could be on the verge of quitting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> after hunger pains have driven him close to the edge.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal and England footballer was tipped to be one of the campmates to go all the way to the final after his friend Harry Redknapp was crowned King of the Jungle last year.</p>
      <p>It has been a different experience for Wrighty though, as the meal rations have hit hard, with the latest decision by campmates pushing him closer to walking than any point in the series so far.</p>
      <p>Bookies have slashed the odds on the football pundit being the first to leave, just days after he was the pre-show favourite to scoop the crown.</p>

      <p>Viewers at home are convinced that Ian has had enough and they fear he will quit the show before it reaches the second week.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one wrote: "Ian is going to be the first to walk"</p>
      <p>Another agreed, adding: "Ian's going to walk isn't he"</p>
      <p>A third predicted: "Ian's going to walk..."</p>

      <p>This all followed fresh tension in the camp after Myles Stephenson and Jacqueline Jossa's decision to send dinner to the jungle jail camp, after they won the stars in the Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Breaking the news to the main camp, Roman read from a laminate: "Earlier Jacqueline chose Myles to join her in today's Trial, the Snake Hotel where they won six stars. They were then told they must join the outlaws in the jail house.</p>
      <p>"However they were given the opportunity of whether to feed the main camp or take the food with them.</p>

      <p>"Jacqueline and Myles decided to take the food with them to the Jungle jailhouse. As a result you have just got rice and beans tonight."</p>
      <p>Ian was distraught with this news and hit out at the decision, saying: "And how that's just going to put me in the wrong vibe all day now."</p>
      <p>Later Ian added: "I am gutted. Of course I am. And I'm not going to be any different than that because I'm actually pleased I'm not in a situation where I'd have to make that choice.</p>
      <p>"It would have actually made me feel terrible."</p>
