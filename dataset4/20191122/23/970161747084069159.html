      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> has hit back at Lucas Torreira’s agent after he suggested the Uruguayan could leave the club in January.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has made just four league starts for the Gunners and Pablo Bentancur, Torreira’s agent, said he would consider his options after being unhappy with Emery’s decision to play him in a more advanced midfield role.</p>
      <p>‘When the transfer window arrives we will see what will happen. I don’t know what can happen in the future,’ said Bentancur.</p>
      <p>However, Emery has dismissed the chances of Torreira leaving and says the midfielder has a ‘big future’ at Arsenal, providing he can improve.</p>

      <p>‘I spoke with him yesterday and today. I showed him some movies about his best performances with us and how he can improve,’ said Emery.</p>

      <p>‘First, he is young. His process here is starting. He started playing in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> last year and he progressed, but this year again he needs to progress.</p>
      <p>‘He is a very good player, important for us, and his focus needs to be with us 100 per cent. His response to me was positive, this morning and yesterday, and then we showed how he can improve for our capacity of our necessary tactical movement.</p>
      <p>‘He’s a good player for us, he has very big commitment and very good behaviour. He has a very big future here but thinking he needs to improve. He has to learn in some situations, individually to help us, to do better. It’s one process.’</p>
      <p>Torreira made an impressive start at the Emirates last season but he’s been slowly phased out of the side.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk earlier this week, Arsenal legend Martin Keown claimed Emery’s treatment of Torreira, especially in contrast to Granit Xhaka, had turned supporters against the manager.</p>
      <p>‘I would have thought it would have been very obvious that he has to play. He’s tenacious,’ said Keown.</p>
      <p>‘The Chelsea game at home, the Liverpool game at home last season, he was playing in that team and Arsenal looked better for it.</p>

      <p>‘This is why I think the fans went against Emery because Xhaka played no matter what when Torreira had to sit on the bench. Ceballos plays one game for Arsenal [against Burnley] and was absolutely brilliant but he’s back on the bench. Maybe it’s Xhaka he needs to take out.’</p>
