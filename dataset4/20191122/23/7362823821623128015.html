      <h1>Sports broadcaster calls out train passenger's bare feet on empty seat</h1>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">London </a>sportscaster called out a train <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/airline-fight-window-shade-video">passenger </a>on Wednesday for putting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/airline-passenger-feet-headrest">bare feet</a> on an empty seat.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports presenter Faye Carruthers shared a picture of the passenger on the Thameslink service train with her more than 25,000 followers. “So wrong on so many levels…#people,” she captioned.</p>
      <p>The post drew the ire of disgusted Twitter users who found the passenger’s barefoot comfort distasteful.</p>

      <p>“Why are people like this?” one Twitter user commented.</p>
      <p>“I’d whack them with his newspaper that’s just gross,” another person wrote.</p>
      <p>Others shared their own personal gripes while traveling, like one person who shared a series of photos of people putting their feet on empty seats – although none of them were barefoot.</p>
      <p>“I see your pic &amp; raise you... Small collection of 'eewwwww' things that cannot be unseen,” the person tweeted.</p>

      <p>Another Twitter user wondered what was worse, bare feet on a train seat or “a passenger deciding to break wind very loudly on a Sunday evening heading to Southampton.”</p>
      <p>“The man did it without a care in the world. The aroma was as bad as noise,” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>After some commenters suspected that train passenger Carruthers photographed was a man, she later clarified it was a woman.</p>
      <p>Everyone thinking it’s a bloke - it’s a woman,” she tweeted, “Was [very] tempted to say something and then just moved.”</p>

      <p>Not everyone, however, found the passenger’s behavior to be so bad. One person said they thought she was simply being “polite.”</p>
      <p>“She probably thinks she’s being polite by not putting her shoes on the seat!” the Twitter user said.</p>
