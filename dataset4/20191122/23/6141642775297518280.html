      <p>Former US national security adviser John Bolton says he has regained control of his personal Twitter account from the White House.</p>

      <p>Mr Bolton’s actions and words are being closely followed in the House impeachment inquiry. He has declined to give evidence unless a federal judge determines he can be compelled to testify against the White House’s wishes.</p>
      <p>Mr Bolton issued a series of tweets that began with him saying he was glad to be back on Twitter and to “stay tuned”.</p>
      <p>A third tweet accused the White House of refusing to return access to the account, asking: “Out of fear of what I may say?”</p>
