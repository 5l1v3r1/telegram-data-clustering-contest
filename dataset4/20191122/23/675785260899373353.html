      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a>’s husband Dan Osborne insists she will not quit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I’m A Celebrity</a> and is glad his idol Ian Wright is helping her.</p>
      <p>The soap star was picked by the public to do the day's Bushtucker Trial but in a twist she was allowed to choose one camp member to join her.</p>
      <p>She chose Myles Stephenson and they set off for Ol' Dingo Town where they were tasked by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly to complete the Snake Hotel challenge.</p>
      <p>During her Bushtucker Trials which included sticking her head in a helmet full of spiders, Jacqueline sobbed and was shaky.</p>
      <p>Former TOWIE star Dan said: “It is horrible seeing Jac upset, she is missing the girls but she will be fine.</p>

      <p>"Talking about them probably helped and she will share some nice memories. Before you know it they will be out in Australia waiting for Jac when she comes out.”</p>
      <p>He added that he was “pleased she has got one of his idols Ian Wright in there” for support saying he was looking forward to having beer with him.</p>
      <p>In last night’s trial called Snake Hotel, Jacqueline was joined by Myles Stephenson who she chose to help win meals for camp.</p>

      <p>Myles ended up locked in a chest with snakes while a screaming Jacqueline searched a snake-filled hotel to find stars.</p>
      <p>They managed to win all six and were then told they were joining Andy Whyment, Cliff Parisi, Kate Garraway and Andrew Maxwell in the Jungle Jailhouse, meaning the jail and camp both had six people in them.</p>
      <p>They could decide which camp got the meals and, after playing a game of rock, paper, scissors, the food went to the Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, campmates including Ian Wright and James Haskell weren't exactly thrilled when they got to rescue new arrival Cliff Parisi from jungle jail.</p>

      <p>Ahead of his arrival, those waiting for him at Main Camp couldn't hide their slight disappointment as they'd hoped for chocolate.</p>
      <p>It was a little while before they got over it, with Cliff soon arriving and receiving a warm welcome.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle later confessed in the Bush Telegraph: "I felt sorry for Cliff as there was high hopes for a phone call and come chocolate and then Cliff came which was great but I think there was a ‘oh, they’re back and they’ve not got any chocolate’."</p>
