      <h1>3D Realms’ Quake 1 engine FPS Wrath: Aeon of Ruin surprise launches in Early Access</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:01:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author">Chris J Capel</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>Way back <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/wrath-aeon-of-ruin/wrath-aeon-of-ruin-release-date">in March this year</a>, 3D Realms revealed a promising new FPS called Wrath: Aeon of Ruin – a shooter developed by KillPixel and a set of “Quake scene veterans,” built on the game engine from id Software’s original Quake. It was then due for a release in Summer, but that came and went and we didn’t hear much from the project, other than a short showing off at Gamescom.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Today, in a surprise move, 3D Realms has shock-launched Wrath: Aeon of Ruin in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1000410/WRATH_Aeon_of_Ruin/">Steam Early Access</a>. This version consists of the hub world, two levels, five weapons, eight enemies, and four artifacts to unearth.</p>
      <p>The team plan to release new levels at unspecified periodic intervals, leading up to the full release – where the game will also get a multiplayer component. The final game was originally stated to offer three hub worlds and 15 interconnected levels – so the launch version of the Early Access release offers around 15% of the final game, although of course Wrath may get expanded before the full release.</p>
      <p>In total the Early Access version will get the first five levels, 11 of the 15+ enemy roster, half the weapons, and half the artifacts. All of the game’s story and plot elements – yes, it will have those – are being deliberately withheld, so as not to spoil anything.</p>

      <p>The game itself plays like a deliberate throwback to the Quake 1 era of shooters, similar to the fantastic <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dusk/dusk-90s-shooter">Dusk</a> – hopefully Wrath will nail the style just as well as that game did. 3D Realms already has the excellent <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ion-fury/review">Ion Fury</a> under its belt this year, and that had a similar path to release that Wrath is now taking.</p>
      <p>If all goes to plan, the full version of Wrath: Aeon of Ruin will release in Summer 2020. You can either buy it for 5% off between now and December 3, or in a bundle with Ion Fury for 10% off the pair. The price may go up between now and the game’s release, but 3D Realms promises to inform the community if and when that’ll happen.</p>
