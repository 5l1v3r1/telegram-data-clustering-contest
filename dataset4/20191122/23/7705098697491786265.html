      <p>Robert Pattinson’s Batman will face Catwoman, the Riddler, and the Penguin when the Dark Knight’s next movie arrives in 2021. But of course, no Batman film is complete if the title character doesn’t have any mobsters to contend with as well. Director Matt Reeves has just confirmed that John Turturro has joined <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a> as Carmine Falcone. You can check out Reeves’ announcement via <a href="https://twitter.com/mattreevesLA/status/1198001378125393920">Twitter</a> below.</p>

      <p>Turturro is primarily known as a regular fixture in the Coen Brothers’ films, including <b>The Big Lebowski</b>, <b>Barton Fink</b>, and <b>O Brother, Where Art Thou</b><b>?</b> He has previously earned Golden Globe nominations for his performances in <b>Quiz Show</b> and the HBO miniseries <b>The Night Of</b>. In recent years, Turturro has appeared in four of Michael Bay’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/transformers"><b>Transformers</b></a> movies as Agent Seymour Simmons. His latest film is <b>The Jesus Rolls</b>, which he wrote, directed, and starred in. That film is a <b>Big Lebowski</b> spinoff that features Turturro reprising his role as Jesus Quintana.</p>

      <p>Carmine Falcone made his comics debut in Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli’s <b>Batman: Year One</b> story in 1987. He also played a major role in Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale’s <b>Batman: The Long Halloween </b>miniseries, which debuted in 1996. Obviously, Turturro won’t be the first actor to bring the mafioso to life in live action. Tom Wilkinson portrayed the character in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/batman-begins"><b>Batman Begins</b></a> in 2005. Years later, John Doman began playing him on Fox’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/gotham"><b>Gotham</b></a>.</p>
      <p><b>The Batman</b> flies into theaters on June 25, 2021.</p>
