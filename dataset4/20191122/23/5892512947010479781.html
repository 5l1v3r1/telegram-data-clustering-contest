      <p>One of the biggest rematches of the year will come to fruition tomorrow night (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) live on FOX PPV from inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, as reigning WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KO) puts his belt on the line again in a main event rematch with Cuban southpaw Luis Ortiz (31-1, 26 KO).</p>
      <p>Remember, the two heavyweights collided in March of last year from inside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. It ended up being one of the toughest fights of Wilder’s storied career and a matchup that ultimately forced “Bronze Bomber” to fight from behind and land a critical 10th-round TKO finish. Without that win, fight fans may not have even seen Wilder fight Tyson Fury later that year in one of the most talked about boxing matches in a very long time.</p>
      <p>In advance to Wilder’s anticipated rematch with Ortiz, both heavyweights stepped on the scale earlier tonight for official weigh ins. Wilder, who is known as a slimmer heavyweight with incredible punching power, came in at 219.5 pounds. Ortiz, on the other hand, is a bigger-framed heavyweight and he touched down at 236.5 pounds.</p>
      <p>After both men made their title rematch official they came face-to-face for one final staredown. Check it out above courtesy of FOX Sports/PBC.</p>
      <p>With limited MMA action this weekend it’s going to be easy for Wilder vs. Ortiz 2 to garner the attention it deserves. Because whether or not you enjoy Wilder’s chaotic fighting style there’s no denying that the 34-year-old champion is one of the most dominant forces in boxing today.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MMAmania will have LIVE coverage of the main event, which caps off a 9:00 pm Eastern FOX pay-per-view.</b>
