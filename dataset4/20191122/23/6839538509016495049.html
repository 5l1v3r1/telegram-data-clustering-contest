      <p>A micro-budget can go a long way if you have Bondi Beach as your backdrop and an 18-year-old’s reckless bravado as your driving force.</p>
      <p>Writer-actor-producer Hal Cumpston wrote the screenplay for this raucous coming-of-age comedy on his return home from Schoolies Week. It took him just 10 days.</p>
      <p>That raw energy — together with the immediacy of his recent experience — is translated onto the big screen thanks to the efforts of a fresh, talented young cast and the support of seasoned elders such as composer Jonathan Zwartz.</p>

      <p>Cumpston’s father, Jeremy, one of the co-founders of two independent Sydney theatre institutions — Tamarama Rock Surfers and The Old Fitzroy Theatre — directs.</p>
      <p>Feeding the anarchic spirit of this naturalistic, Australian answer to Superbad, which charts 24 hours in the life of a bunch of Year 12 students, is a cracker soundtrack featuring more than half a dozen contemporary Australian bands, including Violent Soho, Dune Rats, Hockey Dad and Drunk Mums.</p>
      <p>Lending some texture to the hard-partying narrative is an insider’s view of the eastern suburbs, which despite its privileged reputation, is also home to a dwindling population of battlers.</p>
      <p>While the film’s protagonists — a motley bunch of slackers and jocks — get to party in harbourside mansions, most of them live in fairly modest circumstances.</p>
      <p>The tensions between these two worlds plays out in a long-running feud between the public students and their private school counterparts.</p>
      <p>Perhaps because he knows the material so well, Cumptson Jr is a very relaxed screen presence as Hal, a smart, mouthy, Year 12 student who harbours a secret dream of attending acting school (he auditions with a moving monologue from the play Shadow Boxing, written for Australian actor David Field).</p>
      <p>Frederick Du Rietz is strong, too, as Hal’s loyal offsider, Matt. Mitzi Ruhlmann also stands out as Lucy, the good sport relegated to the friend zone by Hal’s emotional cowardice.</p>
      <p>It might be a little rough around the edges, but Cumpston’s attention-grabbing debut offers a vivid snapshot of a very particular time and place. Not so much Dazed and Confused as grilled and sunburnt.</p>
