      <p>REUTERS: Celtic have been fined €15,000 (US$16,582) by UEFA for illicit banners and offensive chants by their supporters in their Europa League match against Lazio last month, European soccer's governing body said on Friday (Nov 22).</p>
      <p>Scottish champions Celtic beat the Italian outfit 2-1 at Celtic Park but the game was overshadowed by events off the pitch.</p>

      <p>A home supporters group displayed signs that read "Brigate Verde" - along with a white star - which bore a resemblance to Italian left-wing organisation Brigate Rosse.</p>
      <p>Another flag depicted Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini hanging with the slogan "Follow Your Leader."</p>
      <p>UEFA rules prohibit "provocative messages that are of a political, ideological, religious or offensive nature".</p>
      <p>UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body also hit Lazio with a fine of 10,000 euros for offensive chanting.</p>
