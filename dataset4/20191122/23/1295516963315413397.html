      <h1>Uncredited Tracing of Bill Morrison's Simpsons Artwork Sells for $15 Million</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:11:06+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:11</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Cronin</a></address>
      <p>The memories of Roy Lichtenstein have never felt as present as they do upon hearing the news that a painting by former graffiti artist, Kaws (real name Brian Donnelly) called “The KAWS Album," a reworking of Bill Morrison's 1998 cover for the "music from The Simpsons" album, <i>The Yellow Album</i>, with the characters eyes turned into crosses, sold in April for $14.8 million.</p>
      <p>The news of the sale did not reach Morrison until recently and now that he knows that a painting that effectively traced his original piece of art has been sold, without credit to him, for nearly $15 million, the veteran comic book artist is not exactly pleased.</p>

      <p>Morrison <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/a-tracing-of-bill-morrisons-artwork-sold-for-15-million-he-received-no-credit-or-compensation-182746.html">discussed the situation with Cartoon Brew</a>, noting that “Because of the amazingly high purchase price, I felt an instant kinship with other comic book artists who have had their work stolen and turned into ‘fine art."</p>
      <p>The key thing that Morrison takes issue with is that while his <a href="https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-unused-quantum-suit-design-concept-art/">Simpsons</a> cover...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yellow-album.png?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=963&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>is clearly, itself, a parody of another work of art, specifically the cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (produced by Jann Haworth and Peter Blake)....</p>

      <p>his parody is a significant difference than what Kaws did to his work...</p>

      <p>Morrison argues, "For something to be a successful parody, you want the audience to recognize the source. In the case of my Yellow Album piece, that was easy. The Beatles album cover is so iconic that my Simpsons version was instantly recognized by the world as a parody. Also, my art was hand-drawn, inspired by the original Beatles cover, but not traced off from it, making it an authentically original piece of art (though inspired by someone else’s work, in this case that of Jann Haworth and Peter Blake.)</p>
      <p>The Kaws painting has been mistaken for a parody of the original Beatles album cover, with no mention of the actual source, my artwork. I believe that Kaws’ audience largely has no knowledge of the Simpsons Yellow Album, and if that’s the case his painting would not be a parody. Of course, it’s possible that Kaws has misjudged his audience and thinks my piece is more famous than it is."</p>

      <p>This has been Kaws' approach for years now, with his art taking popular characters from cartoons and comics and re-envisioning them with his trademark crossed out eyes, like this Fat Albert piece...</p>

      <p>This, of course, evokes the works of artists like Andy Warhol, and his Campbell Soup can art...</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>and more specifically, Roy Lichtenstein's pop art that has also sold for millions while taking comic book panels (uncredited, of course) and enlarging them into paintings...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/whaam-roy.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=404&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>"The Lichtenstein comparison struck Morrison from a personal perspective, "Russ Heath was a friend of mine, so I know from personal conversations that he was injured by the fact that his images sold for millions of dollars, without a penny going to him. Russ passed away last year. He was on a fixed income, living on social security and an occasional commission. Russ did a comic strip about his experience with the Lichtenstein paintings, and I know it bothered him that people were making so much money from his work while he struggled to get by.</p>
      <p>So the news of the Kaws painting struck a chord with me. If nothing else, I hope this creates awareness of the fact that comic book artists, who generally work insane hours and don’t make a lot of money, have to see their images appropriated by the fine art world to this day, without any additional compensation, and that’s just not right."</p>
      <p>The question of what is fine art is never going to be answered, of course, but you would think that a $15 million painting could at least credit the artist that was traced to create such an incredibly valuable painting.</p>
