      <p>Ulster head coach Dan McFarland admitted John Cooney’s match-winning try in the 18-13 success against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont">Clermont</a> Auvergne left him with his heart in his mouth.</p>
      <p>Cooney’s 62nd-minute score, when he kicked through near the Clermont line and then controlled the ball to touch down, ensured that <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> have two wins from two to lead Pool Three of the Heineken Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>“John has got lots of tricks in his bag and he is an incredibly skilful player and it was a great bit of play from him,” said McFarland.</p>

      <p>“John told me that he has been practising that move for years, when he breaks blind and chips, but that he has never actually done it in a game. So he pulls it out of the bag in a Champions Cup game!</p>
      <p>“When I was watching him from the box there was a big shout of ‘No’ followed by a big shout of ‘Yes!’.”</p>

      <p>Cooney’s try put Ulster 18-6 in front in what was a tight game, with Clermont’s late penalty try bringing the French side a losing bonus point to leave them two points behind the Irish province.</p>
      <p>“Any time in the Champions Cup when you play a French giant and you manage to win the game you have to be happy with that,” stated the Ulster coach.</p>

      <p>“There was a lot to be pleased about in that performance, particularly with the way we limited their opportunities whenever they had the ball in hand.</p>
      <p>“That was going to be the real threat and I said before the game that as a pack we had to bring collective pressure and we had to do that consistently. I felt that we did that.</p>
      <p>“I thought we showed some real attacking glimpses of what we can do in attack. If we had been a little more clinical right at the end we would have had two more tries and they wouldn’t have got a bonus point. But it was pleasing.”</p>
      <p>Jordi Murphy scored Ulster’s other try, converted by Cooney who also kicked two penalties – as did Clermont scrum-half Greig Laidlaw.</p>
      <p>Though disappointed at losing the game, Laidlaw was still pleased to come away with a bonus point from the clash.</p>
      <p>“In a tournament like the Champions Cup it is important to pick up as many points as you can,” said the Scot.</p>
      <p>“We knew it would be tough coming here and obviously we wanted to win, but to come away with a bonus point keeps us well in the group.”</p>
