      <h1>People are saying the 'cybergirl' who introduced Elon Musk at Tesla's Cybertruck unveiling was girlfriend Grimes — here's the evidence</h1>

        <li><a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/tesla">Tesla</a>‘s Cybertruck unveiling in Los Angeles on Thursday night began with an introduction from a mysterious hologram of a woman.</li>
        <li>The hologram bears a strong resemblance to CEO <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>‘s girlfriend, the singer-producer Claire Boucher, better known as Grimes, though it was not introduced as such and she is not credited.</li>
        <li>The “cybergirl” has a leg tattoo that appears to match Grimes’, and her fans are convinced that it was her.</li>
        <li>Spokespeople for Grimes and <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/tesla">Tesla</a> did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.</li>

      <p>Tesla’s Cybertruck unveiling on Thursday night in Hawthorne, California, began on a slightly absurd note.</p>
      <p>A mesh of lasers crossed the stage, and a hologram of a woman in a blond wig appeared.</p>
      <p>“In the future, there will be no straws, I promise,” she said.</p>
      <p>Spectators quickly began to speculate that the “hologram girl” was none other than Grimes, the alt-pop singer and girlfriend of Tesla CEO Elon Musk whose real name is Claire Boucher.</p>
