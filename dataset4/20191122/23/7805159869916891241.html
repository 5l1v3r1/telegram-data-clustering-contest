      <h1>OnePlus 7T Development Update: First Custom ROM, Kernel, and Unbrick Tool released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/idrees-patel/" target="_blank">Idrees Patel</a></address>
      <p>The OnePlus 7T <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7t-review-premium-practical-smartphone/">(review)</a> was announced on September 26 at an event in Delhi, India. The phone is the mid-cycle refresh to the OnePlus 7 <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7-review/">(review)</a>. It’s been less than two months since the phone went on sale, and already we are seeing custom development for it in the form of a custom ROM and custom kernels. This comes as no surprise as OnePlus phones have historically been developer-friendly. OnePlus promptly released the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7t-kernel-sources-now-available/">kernel sources for the OnePlus 7T</a> as well as its bigger brother, the OnePlus 7T Pro <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7t-pro-xda-review/">(review)</a>. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-promote-custom-roms-eol-devices-open-bug-bounty-program/">OnePlus’ developer program</a> means that the company even goes one step beyond by sending select developers units of its devices for development purposes. One week ago, we covered the OnePlus 7T Pro’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7t-pro-development-update-unbrick-tool-magisk-installer-custom-kernels/">latest custom developments</a> by pointing out that the official unbrick tool, <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk">Magisk</a> installer, and a few custom kernels were available for the device. Now, it’s the OnePlus 7T’s turn.</p>

      <h3>OmniROM</h3>
      <p>The first custom ROM is now available for the OnePlus 7T, and it comes in the form of OmniROM. According to the developer, the ROM doesn’t have any major bugs, while in terms of minor bugs, the fingerprint sensor may be a bit unreliable. As <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-twrp/">TWRP</a> is not available for new devices launching with Android 10, the procedure to flash this ROM is completely different from flashing conventional ROMs. Users interested in flashing the ROM should carefully refer to the instructions mentioned by the developer in the ROM thread.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>blu_spark kernel</h3>
      <p>blu_spark kernel is a famous custom kernel, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/adamconway/">Adam</a> has even <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/com-interview-eng-stk-blu-spark-kernel-1/">interviewed its developer in the past</a>. Now, it’s available for the OnePlus 7T. As there is no TWRP available for the OnePlus 7T yet, users can try flashing it with EXKM or Franco Kernel Manager. The blu_spark kernel adds many features such as KCAL (advanced color control), WireGuard support, gesture haptic feedback control, tunable vibrator strength, and much more.</p>

      <h3>ElementalX kernel</h3>
      <p>ElementalX by XDA Recognized Developer <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4684315">flar2</a> is also available for the 7T, but he hasn’t made a forum thread since it’s only accessible from within his paid app, EXKM.</p>
      <h3>Unbrick tool</h3>
      <p>The OnePlus unbrick tool, also known as the msmtool, is the unbrick package that can revive individual bricked OnePlus devices. The version for the OnePlus 7T is now available. It comes in the form of an EDL package. It can also be used to rollback the user’s phone to a previous release of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/oxygenos/">OxygenOS</a>. It should work with the Chinese, Indian, European, and North American unlocked variants of the phone.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Unbrick tool (only T-Mobile)</h3>
      <p>This version of the OnePlus unbrick tool will only work with OnePlus 7T devices brought from T-Mobile. To be specific, it only works with T-Mobile variant HD1907. After use, the user’s phone will be restored to OxygenOS 10.0.3. Functionally, it is identical to the unbrick tool for the international variants of the phone.</p>
