      <p>The prime minister went on to say that those who were standing on the containers are actually scared of the success of the government on the economic front, adding that they are also scared that we will recover the plundered amount from them.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan said that the provincial governments of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are going to introduce new municipal system which Pakistan always lacked.</p>
      <p>He stressed that foreign countries made progress owing to effective municipal system, whereas, power has still not been transferred at the municipal level in Pakistan. He vowed to grant funds to villages under the new system as local body elections are scheduled after a few months.</p>
      <p>The PM told that his government inherited historic financial loss worth 19.5 billion. Exports were less than imports which resulted in the rupee devaluation, he added.</p>
      <p>The price of UD dollar, which is now Rs155, could have gone to Rs250 but our government did not let that happen, Imran Khan told. </p>
      <p>Alluding to the economic challenges inherited by present government, PM Imran Khan said the economic indicators have now been put on the positive trajectory as a result of the policies of his economic team. He said rupee has stabilized and the current account deficit has been reduced for the first time in four years. He said the country has been put on the right direction.</p>
