      <h3>Big Weeks</h3>
      <p><b>Carson Wentz QB, Eagles, vs. Seahawks (FanDuel $7,300/DraftKings $5,600)</b><br/>Seattle has allowed the fifth-most passing yards, including more than 330 in two of its past three games. A West Coast team playing at 1 p.m. on the East Coast could make defense sluggish. This game could be a shootout.</p>
      <p><b>Bo Scarbrough RB, Lions, at Redskins (FD $6,400/DK $4,200)</b><br/>Big, burly backup back got 14 carries last week against a more formidable Dallas defense. Only the Dolphins and Bears have failed to total 100 rushing yards against a weak Redskins run defense that ranks 26th in fantasy points allowed to opposing RBs.</p>
      <p><b>D.K. Metcalf WR, Seahawks, at Eagles (FD $6,700/DK $6,300)</b><br/>Top receiver Tyler Lockett might not be 100 percent. The Eagles are much more vulnerable in the air than on the ground and have allowed nine passing plays of 40-plus yards, tied for fourth-most. Metcalf has five straight games with at least five targets, including at least nine in three of those.</p>
      <p><b>Tyler Boyd WR, Bengals, vs. Steelers (FD $5,600/ DK $5,000)</b><br/>This is the Greasy Wheel Play of the Week: He is coming off his worst game of the seasons — season-lows in catches (one), yards (zero), targets (three) and fantasy points (two) — and he openly complained about it during the week.</p>
      <h3>Small Weaks</h3>
      <p><b>Aaron Rodgers QB, Packers, at 49ers (FD $7,700/DK $6,000)</b><br/>Has six games this season with fewer than 15 fantasy points. The 49ers have allowed an average of 7.4 fantasy points to all opposing QBs other than Kyler Murray. Having just one legitimate passing target, Davante Adams, makes the passing game easier to stop.</p>
      <p><b>Amari Cooper WR, Cowboys, at Patriots (FD $7,700/DK $6,600)</b><br/>The Patriots’ secondary is excellent, and a one-on-one matchup with Stephon Gilmore, Jonathan Jones or Jason McCourty isn’t in Cooper’s favor, especially one week removed from being shut down by Detroit’s Darius Slay. New England has given up one TD to receivers all season.</p>
      <p><b>John Brown WR, Bills, vs. Broncos (FD $6,500/DK $6,700)</b><br/>Denver cornerback Chris Harris Jr. has locked down Allen Robinson, Davante Adams, T.Y. Hilton, Odell Beckham Jr. and Stefon Diggs this season. Brown will be his next victim.</p>
      <p><b>Noah Fant TE, Broncos, at Bills (FD $5,100/DK $3,900)</b><br/>Buffalo is the league’s stingiest team against opposing tight ends — giving up just one TD all season and just two games of double-digit fantasy production. Despite Fant’s explosion in targets in recent weeks, lack of efficiency and a bad matchup will undermine his volume-based upside.</p>
