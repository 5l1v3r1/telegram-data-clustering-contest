      <p>Edward Norton has revealed that he previously saved Leonardo DiCaprio’s life while the two were on a diving trip.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to imagine that Leo almost lost his life, but thankfully Edward was on hand to bring him to safety.</p>
      <p>The two actors were scuba diving together in the Galapagos Islands, when Leo swam off to chase a pack of eagle rays. The only problem is, is that the 45-year-old did not have enough oxygen in his tank.</p>
      <p>Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show, Edward recalled: ‘We were in the Galapagos Islands. We were scuba diving with Sylvia Earle, the great oceanographer. I’ve known Leo a long time and he loses his mind around animals.</p>
      <p>‘He really has a childlike passion for them. This flight of 100 spotted eagle rays went by below us and I saw the look on his face.’</p>

      <p>The 50-year-old could sense that there would be a problem when Leo decided to swim off, so made the decision to follow him – and it was this, he claimed, that helped save the actor’s life.</p>
      <p>‘I saw him charging off with this camera that he had and I have been diving since I was 16 years old,’ he continued. ‘I reflectively looked at my watch and was like, “We’re very close to the end.”</p>

      <p>‘I saw him going off and down and I knew that wasn’t a good thing, so I followed him because I thought to myself, “He’s chasing these things, he’s going to run out of air” – and he did.’</p>
      <p>Scuba diving asides, it was previously revealed that the Titanic star was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/leonardo-dicaprio-problem-saying-n-word-django-unchained-jamie-foxx-samuel-l-jackson-forced-11200400/">uncomfortable on the set of the 2012 movie Django Unchained</a>, as his character had to use racial slurs.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a clip exclusively shared with Metro.co.uk, his co-star, Jamie Foxx said: ‘Leonardo DiCaprio had a problem with saying the word n****r.’</p>
      <p>As he began to imitate Leo, he continued: ‘[He said] “Pal, pal, it’s tough for me to say this.”</p>
      <p>‘I remember Samuel L Jackson going, “Get over here, motherf****r, this is just another Tuesday motherf****r. I don’t give a f*** about these motherf****rs, look at who I am, motherf****r.”’</p>
