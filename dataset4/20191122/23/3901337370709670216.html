      <p>Borussia Dortmund came back from three goals down to force a 3-3 draw with struggling Paderborn at Signal Iduna Park on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Paco Alcacer and Marco Reus, Jadon Sancho and Aixel Witsel returned to spearhead the host's attack who aimed to close the gap at the top of the standings.</p>
      <p>Within first five minutes from start, Dortmund went down when Streli Mamba connected with a delivery from Kai Proger to nestle the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Misery further dampened Dortmund eight minutes to the interval after Mamba punished the hosts whilst peeling off a mid-waist delivery in the area to confirm his brace.</p>
      <p>A substitute subsequently enforced followed for the visitors, who introduced Abdelhamid Sabiri for Sebastian Vasiliadis three minutes thereafter.</p>
      <p>That didn’t stop the side from raising their advantage three minutes later as Gerrit Holtmann connected with James Collins to slot home the third.</p>
      <p>A change from the Dortmund end also showed arrived at the start of the second half, with Alcacer asked to make way for Julian Brandt to bolster the attack.</p>
      <p>The Black and Yellow brigade were out firing in the second half and as such, reduced the tally through Sancho who finished exquisitely amidst a cluster of bodies around him.</p>
      <p>Dortmund quickly pushed further and further on charge, but weren’t met on the same wavelength by Witsel and Mats Hummels who squandered clear openings a little later afterwards.</p>
      <p>Paderborn had their more illustrious adversaries right under their spell until Witsel rose forward to smack home a cross from Hummels on 84 minutes.</p>
      <p>The comeback was completed right at the death when Reus headed home from close range following a pin-point cross from Sancho as Dortmund had to settle for a point.</p>
