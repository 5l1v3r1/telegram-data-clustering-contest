      <p>Caitlyn Jenner performed her own rendition of daughter Kylie Jenner's viral hit Rise and Shine on I'm A Celebrity on Friday.</p>
      <p>But her campmates did not see the funny side of the early wake-up call.</p>
      <p>One contestant in particular left ITV viewers in hysterics, appearing terrified by the sudden noise in the jungle.</p>
      <p>As Caitlyn screamed: "Rise and shine", Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson stared out of his sleeping bad with a look of utter fear.</p>
      <p>He was a mood, that's for sure, as he wondered what was going on.</p>
