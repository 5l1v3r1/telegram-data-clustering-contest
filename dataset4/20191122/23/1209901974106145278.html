      <h1>‘He listened:’ Alberta’s energy minister meets with federal counterpart in Calgary</h1>
      <h2>Sonya Savage says her priority is dealing with the CN rail strike</h2>

      <p>Alberta’s energy minister says she had a productive meeting with Canada’s newly appointed natural resources minister, but adds she hopes to see action in the near future.</p>
      <p>Sonya Savage met with Seamus O’Regan, an MP from Newfoundland, Friday during his first official visit to Alberta.</p>
      <p>“It was a great opportunity to explain the very real problems that Alberta is facing,” she said after the meeting. “He listened, for sure, and I believe he understood.</p>
      <p>“In the months ahead, we’ll see whether there is action.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, O’Regan said that the federal government shares a common goal of ensuring that the country’s natural resources, including oil and gas in Alberta, are sustainably developed and continue to be a source of well-paying jobs.</p>
      <p>“My focus at this time is to listen and fully understand the challenges faced by this industry, and the impact those challenges are having on workers and their families,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We remain committed to the Trans Mountain expansion, which is under construction and is already employing thousands of hardworking Canadians.”</p>
      <p>Savage said there are other issues that need to be addressed in the near future.</p>
      <p>Her priority is dealing with the CN rail strike, which she says is preventing 170,000 barrels of oil from moving out of Alberta every day.</p>
      <p>Savage said her other concern is changing two contentious federal bills that affect the energy industry.</p>
      <p>One of those bills — C-69 — is a contentious piece of legislation overhauling the environmental assessment of major projects. Critics argue it will further strangle natural resources development in red tape.</p>
      <p>O’Regan said in his statement that he looks forward to ongoing conversations about how to best implement the new review process.</p>
      <p>The federal Conservative’s natural resources critic, Shannon Stubbs, said legislative changes are needed.</p>
      <p>“If Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau is to walk the talk on listening to Western Canada and working collaboratively with the premiers, the first step is to scrap Bill C-69 and use the 187 Senate amendments nine out of ten premiers and all territorial leaders asked for as the blueprint to replace it,” she said in a statement.</p>
