      <p>HOUSTON — A former Houston police officer has pleaded not guilty to federal charges he provided false information in a January drug raid that left two people dead and several officers injured.</p>
      <p>Gerald Goines entered his plea during a Friday court hearing.</p>
      <p>A magistrate judge didn’t immediately rule on Goines’ request for bond. Prosecutors are asking he remain in custody.</p>
      <p>The federal charges against Goines and another ex-officer follow state charges filed in August, including two counts of felony murder against Goines.</p>
      <p>The Jan. 28 raid was investigated after police alleged Goines lied to obtain a search warrant.</p>
      <p>At Friday’s hearing, an FBI agent testified authorities found illegal drugs and a stolen gun in Goines’ car and Goines for years had been having a sexual relationship with one of his confidential informants.</p>
