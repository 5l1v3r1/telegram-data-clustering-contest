      <h1>RTÉ journalists want top fees and salaries to be 'slashed'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:18:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/evelyn-ring/" target="_blank">By Evelyn Ring</a></address>
      <p>RTÉ journalists want fees and salaries paid to the broadcaster's top presenters and managers to be “slashed”.</p>
      <p>They believe the broadcaster's proposal to cut 15% off payments to its top contracted presenters to deal with the crisis does not go far enough.</p>
      <p>The RTÉ sub-branch of the Dublin broadcasting branch of the National Union of Journalists want a €208,000 cap placed on fees paid to the top presenters.</p>
      <p>A resolution, backed overwhelmingly at an NUJ meeting of journalists at the organisation, says current pay levels are now “indefensible.”</p>
      <p>They want to ensure that no one in the organisation is earning more than the top civil service salary of €207,590 paid to secretary generals.</p>
      <p>“We believe this would be an important first step towards addressing the valid concerns felt by the public who we serve,” the branch stated.</p>
      <p>It was now more than ever “indefensible” that RTÉ continued to pay exorbitant salaries of close to half a million euro to a small number of people in the organisation.</p>
      <p>“We understand the public anger at this and believe that anger is justified,” the branch stated.</p>
      <p>“We note that the Netherlands has introduced a law that prohibits anyone working in the public or semi-public sector from earning more than €187,000, by pegging all top salaries to that of the country’s prime minister."</p>
      <p>The measure, which includes those working at the Dutch public broadcaster, was introduced as a result of growing social outrage at high salaries.</p>
      <p>Talks between trade unions and RTÉ management on proposals to deal with the financial crisis are expected to begin next week.</p>
