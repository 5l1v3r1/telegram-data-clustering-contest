      <p>Matthew Stafford will miss a third straight game for the Detroit Lions after head coach Matt Patricia confirmed the quarterback will not play against the Washington Redskins.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Stafford previously missed the defeats to the Chicago Bears and the Dallas Cowboys with a back injury, leaving the Lions with a 3-6-1 record.</p>
      <p>The first overall pick in the 2009 draft had started the previous 136 games prior to this absence, with Jeff Driskel replacing him as starter.</p>
      <p>"He [Stafford] won't be on the field," Patricia confirmed to the media ahead of the Week 12 trip to Washington, before praising the 31-year-old for continuing to demonstrate his leadership qualities despite being out of action.</p>
      <p>"What Matthew has done is phenomenal. We have a lot of players that are maybe not out there for the week who help the players get ready," he added.</p>
      <p>"He's done a great job at practice of being on the sidelines and going through the keys, going through the tendencies and going game plan with Jeff.</p>
      <p>"He brings a lot of value to our team by just being there, just with his general presence. What he does as a leader for us is really important."</p>

      <p>Stafford made clear on Thursday that he still hopes to return to action this season, even though Detroit's recent slump has pushed them out of the playoff picture.</p>
      <p>"I love playing football," he told the media.</p>
      <p>"I appreciate all the hard work that all the guys in this locker room and in this organisation put into going out there and trying to win games on Sunday and I love being a part of that."</p>
      <p>Driskel has thrown for 478 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in back-to-back defeats for the Lions.</p>
