      <p>Di Asa Season 3 winner Precious Mensah, known widely as PM has explained to Graphic Showbiz on what culminated in her alleged body shaming by Emirates Airlines enroute to Dubai as part of her prize package for winning the competition.</p>
      <p>Embosuohemaa who works Atinka TV-organisers of the reality show, said PM was unable to join them on the trip because she could not get a seat on the airline due to her size.</p>
      <p>“To the people who are saying Atinka Media Village denied PM a trip to Dubai, please it is not true. The reason PM, winner of Di Asa did not make it was her size.</p>
      <p>“She had her visa, ticket, pocket money, everything; we went through the process only to be told that she could not fit into the seat.</p>
      <p>“We offered to buy an extra seat for her and still she could not fit. Then we asked to buy three and we were told it was not possible. Why would we bring the runners-up here and leave the winner of Di Asa herself out?</p>
      <p>“However, we are not leaving PM out of this whole fun. We plan on giving her a version in any way we can,” she said.</p>
      <p>Embosuohemaa also used the opportunity to urge transport services to start making arrangements for people of all sizes.</p>
      <p>“I want to use this chance to urge transport services to start considering these things. There are different people with different shapes and sizes and their freedom of movement should not be restricted,” she stated.</p>
