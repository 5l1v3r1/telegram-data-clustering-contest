      <p>The mother went through the phone and discovered pornographic material exchanged between the minor and the teacher. She immediately contacted the police and two cases were opened.</p>
      <p>According to Brig Hlati, the accused was arrested on November 19 and charged. He then appeared in the KaBokweni Magistrate Court on November 20, where he was remanded in custody for his formal bail application on November 22.
