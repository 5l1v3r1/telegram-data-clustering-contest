      <h1>Key Dem indicates Warren's wealth tax has little chance of passing House</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:53:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Dorman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Sen. Elizabeth Warren's</a> wealth tax wouldn't have support among the House committee responsible for drafting the policy, a key <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrat</a> on the committee suggested.</p>
      <p>Democrats have reportedly been weighing alternatives to the wealth tax proposed by Warren as part of her attempt to convince the public she could fund her massive "Medicare-for-all" proposal. And according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/ocasio-cortez-skeptical-warren-and-sanders-wealth-tax-could-pass">Bloomberg</a> on Thursday, Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., a senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, indicated that if Warren, D-Mass., tried pushing the tax as president, it wouldn't gain enough traction among House Democrats.</p>
      <p>“If you’re asking about the wealth tax, no,” Pascrell said. His statement was the latest indication that progressive candidates like Warren and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,</a> would face pushback from Democrats if they take the White House.</p>
      <p>Even <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,</a> -- a progressive icon who often demands purity over political practicality -- indicated Warren's tax would face an uphill battle. “It’s not something that’s discussed a lot," she told Bloomberg. She added that she thought the electorate favored a wealth tax but "it’s a matter of, will the more corporate-friendly wing of the party be down for it?”</p>

      <p>Warren's plan would require substantial tax increases on the wealthy as she aimed to implement a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warrens-52t-medicare-for-all-plan-revealed-campaign-still-claims-no-middle-class-tax-hikes-needed">$52 trillion health plan</a> without charging the middle class.</p>
      <p>Warren previously proposed a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth that surpassed $1 billion. That later changed to 6 percent after Warren faced questions over how she would pay for her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care">"Medicare-for-all"</a> plan -- a massive proposal that conservatives have warned would cost too much and burden the economy.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warrens-tax-plan-would-bring-rates-over-100-for-some-11573819200?mod=hp_lead_pos2">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the rates could vary and make 100 percent tax rates "typical" for investment income.</p>
      <p>Warren has defended her tax, arguing that the wealthy don't pay their fair share. The tax, she said, would fund universal childcare and pre-k and her plan to cancel student loan debt, among other things.</p>

      <p>When former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., suggested Warren was unrealistic in her push for "Medicare-for-all," she balked at him, saying she didn't understand why someone would run for president to "talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for."</p>
      <p>It's unclear how much support the ambitious health plan itself will gain in Congress. While the plan has support from progressives like Ocasio-Cortez, it could face pushback from Democratic leadership.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,</a> has already said she hopes the 2020 field moves away from "Medicare-for-all" and toward a health proposal that didn't eliminate private insurance.</p>
      <p>"I would think that hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be more 'health care for all Americans' because there is a comfort level that some people have with their current private insurance," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/pelosi-medicare-for-all-2020">she said</a> at the beginning of November.</p>
