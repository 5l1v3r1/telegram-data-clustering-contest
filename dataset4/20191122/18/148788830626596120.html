      <h1>Colin Trevorrow Says It Was J.J. Abrams’ Idea to Bring Back Palpatine, Reveals His ‘Last Jedi’ Contribution</h1>

      <p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, <b>Colin Trevorrow</b> was going to direct <b><i>Star Wars: Episode IX</i></b>, but then it all fell apart. Trevorrow either walked away amicably or was fired, depending on who you believe. In any case, he’s gone – but his presence will still be felt in <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>. Trevorrow and his writing partner <b>Derek Connolly</b> will both have a “story by” <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-writing-credits/">credit</a> on the film, which means a large part of the film’s story was taken from whatever Trevorrow and Connolly came up with. While we don’t know <i>what</i> Trevorrow deserves credit for yet, here’s something he definitely had nothing to do with: the return of the Emperor. Trevorrow himself says that idea was all J.J. Abrams.</p>
      <p>We may never know what Colin Trevorrow’s <i>Star Wars: Episode 9</i> would’ve looked like, but one thing’s for sure: the Emperor wouldn’t return. Speaking with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/colin-trevorrow-star-wars-rise-skywalker-last-jedi/">Empire</a>, Trevorrow said:</p>
      <blockquote> “Bringing back the Emperor was an idea JJ brought to the table when he came on board. It’s honestly something I never considered. I commend him for it. This was a tough story to unlock, and he found the key.” That said, there are still some of Trevorrow’s ideas in the film. He has a story credit, and he added to Empire: “I’m grateful to JJ [Abrams] for embracing some of our ideas. It’s exciting that fans will get to see the moments that felt essential to all of us.”</blockquote>
      <p>I’m not a big Trevorrow fan, but I’ve yet to be sold on the idea of the Emperor returning. The character was <i>clearly</i> dead at the end of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> – he got thrown down a god damn hole full of <i>exploding lightning</i> on the new Death Star, and then the Death Star <i>blew up</i>. On top of that, there has been zero hint of the Emperor’s presence in the previous two <i>Star Wars</i> film. I’m still reserving judgment for the final film, but as of now, I’m uneasy about the whole thing. But hey, maybe J.J. Abrams pulled it off.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in that interview, Trevorrow reveals that he had a tiny bit of input on <i>The Last Jedi</i> as well. Specifically: a scene near the end of the film. “I just asked Rian if he could include a little moment where Rey and Poe meet for the first time,” says Trevorrow. “They’re such beloved characters, it felt right for them to have some history in the next movie. I thought the way he did it was perfect.” At the end of <i>The Last Jedi</i>, Poe and Rey share a hello when she finally catches up with the remaining members of the Resistance.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> opens <b>December 20</b>.</p>
