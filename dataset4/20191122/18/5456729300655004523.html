      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:30:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/364647-pid-scam-court-adjourns-hearing-on-britons-bail-variation-application.html" target="_blank">Halimah Yahaya</a></address>
      <p>The Federal High Court in Abuja, on Friday, adjourned hearing on the application for bail variation of a British national, James Nolan, to November 27.</p>
      <p>The judge, Okon Abang, said the development is to allow Mr Nolan’s lawyer, Paul Erokoro, study the counter-affidavit filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)’s lawyer, Ekele Iheanacho, in opposition to the Briton’s plea.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang had on Wednesday fixed the hearing of the application for variation of Mr Nolan’s bail conditions to today.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES reported how the judge on November 7 granted Mr Nolan a bail of N500 million.</p>
      <p>Mr Abang had also ordered the applicant to produce a surety in like sum, who must be a Nigerian and a serving senator not standing any criminal trial in any court in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The judge held that the proposed surety must submit a three years tax clearance certificate and sign an undertaking to always be present in court with the defendant throughout the duration of the trial.</p>
      <p>“The senator must have a landed property fully developed in Maitama District of Abuja and fully certified by the FCDA.</p>
      <p>”The surety must submit two passport photographs,” Mr Abang had ruled.</p>
      <p>The court also ordered Mr Nolan to surrender all his international passports, even as it mandated the Nigerian Immigration Service to confirm how many passports that were issued to him within the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr Erokoro on Wednesday reminded the court about the application for bail variation before it.</p>
      <p>The senior counsel urged the court to grant the request to allow him have adequate time and facility for their defence.</p>
