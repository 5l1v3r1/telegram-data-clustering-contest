      <p>Gahan Wilson, the critically acclaimed longtime cartoonist best known for his offbeat cartoons that took a humorous look at horror situations, passed away this week at the age 89.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Wilson drew cartoons for <a href="https://screenrant.com/hugh-hefner-death-obituary/"><i>Playboy</i></a>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Collier's</i>, <i>Look</i> and <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i>. Wilson's offbeat style took a while to get accepted by the magazine world. He explained on his website how he got his big break, ”My big break came when the cartoon editor for Colliers – who, like everybody else, thought the readers wouldn’t understand the cartoons I did – left to become the cartoon editor of Look. In the interim, the art director took over. Not being a trained cartoon editor, he did not realize my stuff was too much for the common man to comprehend, and he thought it was funny. I was flabbergasted and delighted when he started to buy it! He wasn’t in all that long, about a month and a half, but by that time my cartoons had started to appear. The guy who had gone to Look saw them in Colliers, and I guess a great dawning occurred, so he started buying them for Look, and that was it – I was now a big-time cartoonist! Absolutely foolish, but that’s the way it happened. That was the chink in the armor, and I just got through it."</p>

      <p>Wilson worked in the tradition of the famed New Yorker cartoonist, Charles Addams, who also drew macabre situations with a humorous edge to them. Wilson, though, took a more modernist approach to his cartoons, like a vampire done in by Daylight Savings Time....</p>

      <p>For the most part, though, Wilson's work stood out for just how darkly humorous his cartoons could be. They had a stark edge to them, like this disturbing Christmas classic...</p>

      <p>During the 1970s, Wilson also wrote and drew the excellent comic strip, Nuts, which starred a nameless "everyman" child who went through those universal experiences that kids deal with that few other comic creators were able to capture, like the feeling when you miss a couple of days of school when you're sick and when you return you have trouble catching up...</p>

      <p>Nuts could be practically haunting at times, like the minor rotten stuff you sometimes do that haunts you forever...</p>

      <p>In the 1990s, Wilson scared a whole new generation through is Ultimate Haunted House computer video game...</p>

      <p>Wilson continued working well into his 80s, even after he was diagnosed with dementia. His family had recently started a GoFundMe page to help pay for his care. They raised nearly $85,000. They announced his passing <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/gahan-wilson-team-effort">on the page</a>.</p>
      <p>Our condolences to all of Gahan Wilson's family and friends. His work touched the lives of numerous generations.</p>
