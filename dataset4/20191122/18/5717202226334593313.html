      <h1>Jamie Carragher gives thoughts on Jose Mourinho’s playing style and Tottenham appointment</h1>
      <h2>Mourinho is usually universally celebrated at a new club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:15:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Carragher has offered his thoughts on Jose Mourinho’s arrival at Tottenham by noting the difference in mood around the Portuguese this time around.</p>
      <p>He also touched on Mourinho’s tactical approach, defending his acumen and underlining the importance of every team not playing the exact same way.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/jose-mourinho-needs-prove-spurs-makes-dangerous/">Daily Telegraph,</a> he wrote: “Many Spurs fans would have preferred to keep Mauricio Pochettino. He has never encountered such negativity upon his arrival. Mourinho has reached a point in his career where he needed and craved Spurs more than they needed him.</p>
      <p>“Wherever Mourinho travelled previously… those clubs wanted and needed him as much as he needed them. The world changed for Mourinho after his United exit. The aura is not gone, but it is damaged. Mourinho must adapt at Spurs. Mourinho pursued this job… to remind everyone what an outstanding coach he is.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Mourinho must now prove United was a blip and not permanent decline setting in</h3>
      <p>Mourinho is gradually becoming less successful and leaving bigger messes behind with every job as his career goes along – that’s a worrying trend which came to a head at United.</p>
      <p>He was sacked with Chelsea 16th in the Premier League and fired with United 19 points off the top before Christmas. Mourinho needs to show he still has his touch; in terms of tactics as well as man-management, in 2019.</p>
      <p>At Tottenham, he needs to show that United was a tricky job at a tough time and that he remains capable of guiding a side to major honours.</p>
