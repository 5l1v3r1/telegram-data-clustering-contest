      <p>All-Star first baseman Jose Abreu has signed a new three-year, $50million deal with the Chicago White Sox.</p>
      <p>Abreu last week agreed an initial $17.8m one-year contract extension, but that was expected to be extended.</p>
      <p>The White Sox on Friday announced that the 32-year-old has committed to a deal that will earn him $11m next year, $16m in 2021 and $18m 2022.</p>
      <p>Abreu will also receive a $5m signing bonus and $4m in deferred payments.</p>
      <p>The Cuban led the American League with 123 RBIs this year, batting .284 with 38 doubles, 33 homers and 85 runs over 159 matches.</p>

      <p>"I have to give a special thank you to [White Sox owner] Jerry Reinsdorf and all the people involved with the White Sox who made this possible," said Abreu."This is a dream come true for me and my family.</p>
      <p>"To the fans, I told you I would come back. I never doubted it. Everybody knows the group of talented players that we have, and I want to help guide them and together make the Chicago White Sox a championship team."</p>
      <p>Abreu's new contract was confirmed a day after the White Sox signed free-agent catcher Yasmani Grandal to a four-year contract.</p>
