      <h1>Rafael dos Anjos vs Michael Chiesa agreed for UFC Raleigh in January</h1>

      <p>The UFC’s card in Raleigh next year continues to shape up, as a welterweight fight between Rafael dos Anjos and Michael Chiesa has been agreed on for the card.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/28132221/sources-ufc-finalizing-rafael-dos-anjos-vs-michael-chiesa-jan-25">ESPN</a> first reported the matchup, though the UFC is yet to make an official announcement. This is the promotion’s first event in Raleigh, although the last time they visited the state of North Carolina was at UFC Charlotte in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Dos Anjos (29-12) only has one win in his last four fights at 170-pounds. The Brazilian missed out on interim gold when he lost a decision to Colby Covington in June 2018. “RDA” rebounded off of a loss to Kamaru Usman by submitting Kevin Lee, but most recently suffered another decision loss to Leon Edwards in July.</p>
      <p>Chiesa (16-4) is currently on a two-fight winning streak at welterweight. After suffering consecutive submission losses to Kevin Lee and Anthony Pettis, Chiesa made the decision to move up from lightweight to 170-pounds. It proved to be a good decision, as Chiesa has since picked up a submission win against Carlos Condit and a decision win against Diego Sanchez.</p>
      <p>UFC Raleigh takes place on January 25th at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. The card will be headlined by heavyweight contest between Curtis Blaydes and Junior dos Santos.</p>
