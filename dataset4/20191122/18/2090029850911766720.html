      <p>Uchenna  currently plays for Pensacola FC Women team where she has scored 17 goals in 12 appearances.</p>
      <p>Uchenna  was part of Nigeria’s national women’s team that crashed out in the second round at the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France.</p>
      <p>Before joining the Women’s Premier Soccer League side in 2018, she spent two years with the Southeastern Fire, scoring 115 goals in just 55 matches.</p>
      <p>Her performances have however been noticed as the mayor of the City of Lakeland declared the earlier stated day to celebrate the Nigerian star.</p>
      <p>Taking to its social media page,  Southeastern Fire gushed over the Nigerian star as they shared the good news with fans,</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>November 18 has been declared Uchenna Kanu Day by the mayor of the City of Lakeland!.<br/></i><br/><i>“Uchenna received the Key to the City today, and we’re so proud of her and all she’s accomplished as an SEU student and as soccer player for SEU and her home country of Nigeria.”<br/></i><br/><pic src="https://lailasnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/screenshot_20191122-1702335362275760479051016.png" width="490" height="249"/></blockquote>
