      <h1>Elon Musk unveils Tesla's Cybertruck electric off-road vehicle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/india-block/" target="_blank">India Block</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/tesla">Tesla</a> founder <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> has unveiled the Cybertruck, a bulletproof <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/electric-cars/">electric vehicle</a> clad in the same kind of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/steel">steel</a> being used to make SpaceX's Starship space craft.</p>
      <p>Designed to look like the cross between a pickup truck and a stealth fighter jet, the Cybertruck combines a sports car's acceleration with off-road driving capabilities.</p>
      <p>Panels of cold-rolled stainless steel – the same metal alloy being used for the Starship rocket being developed for trips to Mars – cover its angular body.</p>

      <p>To demonstrate the six-seater truck's toughness at its unveiling onstage at an event in Los Angeles, the vehicle's door was hit with a sledgehammer without leaving a mark.</p>
      <p>The windows are made of Tesla Armor Glass, which is designed to be bulletproof against a nine-millimetre handgun. However the glass shattered when metal balls were thrown at the side windows during the launch event.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>'s Cybertruck can accelerate to 60 miles per hour in just 2.6 seconds and can tow loads of up to 6,400 kilograms.</p>
      <p>Owners will be able to charge their vehicle at home and at Tesla's free Destination Charging points, and it has a range of over 500 miles on just one charge.</p>
      <p>Prices will start at $39,900 for a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model, with an option to pay an extra $7,000 to secure a self-driving version. The Cybertruck will go into production in 2022.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/03/15/tesla-model-y-electric-suv-transport/">Tesla brought out the Model Y</a>, a combination SUV and sports car that Musk claimed will be the "safest midsize-SUV in the world".</p>
      <p>Billionaire Musk, who founded Tesla and Space X, has also founded a startup to connect people's brains to computer interfaces via artificial intelligence. <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/07/22/elon-musk-neuralink-implant-ai-technology/">Called Neuralink</a>, the implants could allow people to use technology just by thinking about it.</p>
      <p>As CEO of SpaceX, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2016/09/28/elon-musk-spacex-colonising-mars-six-years-design-technology/">Musk also plans to colonise Mars</a> with private space missions. Last year he shot his own car – a cherry red Tesla Roadster – into space on <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/02/06/falcon-heavy-launch-time-elon-musk/">the maiden flight of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Rocket.</a></p>
