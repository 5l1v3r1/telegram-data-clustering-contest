      <h1>Pennsylvania Governor Vetoes Bill Banning Down-Syndrome Abortion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:02:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/" target="_blank">Mairead McArdle</a></address>
      <p>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Thursday vetoed a bill that would have prohibited women from choosing abortion because of a Down-syndrome diagnosis.</p>
      <p>“This legislation is a restriction on women and medical professionals and interferes with women’s health care and the crucial decision-making between patients and their physicians,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Physicians and their patients must be able to make choices about medical procedures based on best practices and standards of care.”</p>
      <p>Abortion is legal in Pennsylvania during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy for any reason except the gender of the fetus. The bill, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature a day earlier, aimed to protect against abortions over a prenatal Down-syndrome diagnosis as well, although it included exceptions for rape, incest, and medical emergencies.</p>
      <p>Wold argued that the bill was unconstitutional and “not consistent with the fundamental rights” protected by the 14th Amendment, which guarantees the right to privacy.</p>
      <p>“Further, I am not aware of a single disability-rights group that supports this bill,” Wolf continued. “I support continuing the bipartisan work that’s been done to help people with disabilities. I also believe there is much more Pennsylvania could do to help women and families facing complex pregnancies. However, this bill does not aid in either of these efforts.”</p>
      <p>Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates also objected to the bill, saying it is unconstitutional and nearly impossible to enforce.</p>
      <p>According to the National Down Syndrome Society, one in 700 babies in the U.S., about 6,000 a year, is born with Down syndrome, a genetic condition caused by the presence of an extra chromosome and marked by developmental and physical growth delays.</p>
      <p>Wolf’s decision jives with a federal-appeals court’s October ruling that Ohio may not enforce a law barring doctors from performing abortions on mothers who want the procedure because of a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome.</p>
      <p>The governor is a vocal abortion rights supporter and also rejected a measure in 2017 that would have banned elective abortions after 20 weeks, a week earlier than the youngest premature baby has survived. In August, Wolf’s administration also <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/who-decides-where-pennsylvanians-with-disabilities-should-live/">announced</a> plans to close two state centers for the intellectually and developmentally disabled, including some with Down syndrome. A previous closure of a similar facility in Pennsylvania resulted in the deaths of eleven of the 85 former residents.</p>
