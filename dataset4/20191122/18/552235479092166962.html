      <h2>Ford has unveiled an exciting new electric SUV – the Mustang Mach-E – which is crammed with technology for an enhanced driving experience.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:33:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Russon</a></address>
      <p>THE wraps have come off Ford’s first all-electric SUV – the Mustang Mach-E – which will be on the road later next year and a rival to the likes of the Jaguar I-PACE.</p>
      <p>With a range of more than 370 miles and a 0-62mph acceleration time of less than five seconds, the Mustang Mach-E has a powertrain that develops an estimated 465PS.</p>
      <p>With peak charging power of 150kW, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ford">blue oval badged machine</a> with an extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive can add a driving range of up to 57 miles within 10 minutes of charge time on a DC fast-charging station.</p>
      <p>The standard-range Mustang Mach‑E, which has a 75.7kWh lithium-ion battery, is estimated to charge from 10 per cent to 80 per cent in about 38 minutes while charging on a fast charger.</p>
      <p>The longer-range model has a 98.9 kWh battery pack and Ford says it will also offer a special performance version, the Mustang Mach-E GT, which is the version targeting 0-62mph acceleration in less than five seconds, as well as an estimated 465PS of power and 830Nm of torque.</p>

      <p>The other versions will have 0-62mph times or about seven seconds and all models will have a restricted top speed of 111mph.</p>
      <p>“The Mustang Mach-E is one of the most exciting vehicles Ford has ever introduced,” said Stuart Rowley, president, Ford of Europe. “This purpose-built all-electric vehicle is unique, but still unmistakably a Mustang, and it’s coming at exactly the right time for customers in Europe.”</p>
      <p>The electric SUV shares some of its style with the legendary Mustang muscle machine and has a long bonnet, pronounced rear haunches and the model’s trademark tri-bar taillamps.</p>
      <p>As an SUV, it is a five-seater and comes with a 402 litre boot extending to 1402 litres with the rear seats folded. A further 100 litres of space is available under the bonnet in a waterproof compartment.</p>

      <p>The Mach-E is all-wheel-drive and the power system is fitted with three drive modes – which Ford is calling Whisper, Engage and Unbridled – with each offering different driving experiences and control set ups.</p>
      <p>Performance models will be available with Brembo’s all-new performance Flexira aluminium callipers, which maintain the functionality of a fixed calliper while being designed with the dimensions of a floating calliper, while the Mustang Mach-E GT is also equipped with Ford’s MagneRide damping system, an adaptive suspension system to embellish the ride.</p>
      <p>Technology features include entry and start via a smartphone with a keypad backup on the door pillar and the Mach-E will also see the introduction of Ford’s next-generation SYNC system with a 15.5in portrait-style screen and a simpler interface that does away with complicated menus, making it easier to access features with touch, swipe and pinch controls.</p>
      <p>“The Mustang Mach-E is the start of a new era for Ford and we could not be more excited to bring it to our customers in Europe,” added Mr Rowley. “This all-new vehicle represents so much more than just zero-emission driving: it’s about stress-free experiences and total peace-of-mind for all-electric vehicle owners.”</p>
      <p>The car will be built in Mexico and sold exclusively online, with first deliveries slated towards the end of 2020. Prices are expected to start in the region of £40,000 with the range topping out at around £60,000.</p>
