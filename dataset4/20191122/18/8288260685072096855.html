      <h2>West Bromwich Albion latest - Slaven Bilic has been a hit at The Hawthorns so far, guiding the Baggies to the top of the Championship.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:51:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Kemble</a></address>
      <p>Slaven Bilic has opened up on his experience of taking charge at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> .</p>
      <p>The Croatian boss joined the Baggies after spells with West Ham and Saudi outfit Al-Ittihad.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/slaven-bilic-explains-how-banning-20938437">in an interview with the Mirror</a> , he revealed how, after taking charge of the former, he required the power of music to act as caffeine to wake his players up from a slumber.</p>
      <p>“It was Roy Keane who said you can't play Abba before a game, and I agree with that,” said the West Brom boss.</p>
      <p>“When I went to Liverpool with West Ham in my first season as the manager, it was 50 years since we had beaten them at Anfield.</p>

      <p>“Before the game, we are all in the small away dressing room before the players go out and they have got Red Red Wine from UB40 playing in there.</p>
      <p>“I'm like, 'Red Red Wine? That's for a romantic dinner, it's not a war song!' So I said 'Sorry, lads' and I put on Whisky In The Jar – the Metallica version – and we won 3-0. After that, I didn't interrupt.</p>
      <p>“You have got to be in the zone, allow music to lift you up. When they are promoting Liverpool v Man City on Sky or whatever, it's always power guitars and pumped up. It's never Beethoven.”</p>

      <p>Though, Billic didn't need any such tonic when he arrived at The Hawthorns, West Brom sitting <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-brom-promotion-leeds-forest-16873054">top of the Championship</a> 16 league games into his reign.</p>
      <p>“When I came here, it was like I didn't need to wake them up," he added. "They are good players, they are motivated.</p>
      <p>“It's a big club but a newish team. We lost 11 players, including Dwight Gayle and Jay Rodriguez – that is 46 goals from last season – but we were lucky enough to be good at transfers and they have clicked straight away.</p>
      <p>“The guys who were here were not big-time Charlies, noses in the air, but when a new manager brings in fresh ideas during the first week of pre-season, they all believe in it – but deep in their minds they need proof that it will work... and there is no better proof than results.”</p>
      <p>Bilic went on to speak about how the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> job came about, and how he actually noted the vacancy as one he wanted to land on a particularly small shortlist.</p>
      <p>"It was in April last season, when I was flying from Split to Manchester (as a TV pundit at Manchester United v West Ham) and I had time on the plane to compile a list of places where I would like to work," he continued.</p>
      <p>“First I put England, Germany, Turkey – those countries where I have a name and it would be easier for me to get a job.</p>

      <p>“Under England, OK – I didn't put Manchester City on the list, and I didn't put West Ham! But there were three English teams, and the first one was West Brom.</p>
      <p>“After signing the contract here, when I came home and I was clearing out my backpack, I found that piece of paper.</p>
      <p>“I like it here. Birmingham is half the size of Croatia's entire population, but I've lived in London, Moscow, Istanbul, Jeddah, all massive cities, this is the first time that everywhere is just 15 minutes away.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people told me, 'Birmingham is this, Birmingham is that, it is not nice' – but I have been shocked in a positive way. I couldn't find an apartment in the city centre that was big enough for my family (wife and five children), but we found a place in Sutton Coldfield. It is top, top, top.</p>
      <p>“And the Brummie accent is no problem. Don't forget, I played for Everton and lived on Merseyside. And when Walter Smith was the manager, there were eight to 10 Scots in the dressing room, so this place is a piece of cake.”</p>
