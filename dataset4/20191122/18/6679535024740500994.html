      <p>Normal life was affected in Puducherry due to intermittent rain on Friday.</p>
      <p>Continuous rain for almost three hours on Friday morning resulted in waterlogging in Bussy Street, Lenin Street, Kamaraj Nagar, Uppalam, Reddiyarpalayam and Marimalai Adigal Salai.</p>
      <p>According to an official in the Public Works Department, the region recorded 7. 7 mm of rainfall till 8. 30 a.m. Places such as Bahour, Pathukannu, Moolakulam, Thirukanur and Sedarapet received good rainfall in the morning hours, the official said. A breach in the sewage network at Thiruvalluvar Salai near Uppalam caused hardship to residents and motorists.</p>
