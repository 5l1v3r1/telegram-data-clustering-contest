      <p>A dog found shot in the face northwest of Las Vegas last weekend appears to be on his way to a forever home.</p>
      <p>“He went home as a foster to Doug, one of the two men who found him on the side of the highway,” The Animal Foundation tweeted Thursday. “Doug plans to adopt (him) after Dudley recovers to provide him with a loving furever home!”</p>

      <p>The dog was found bleeding from his mouth around noon Sunday on U.S. Highway 95 near Paiute Drive, according to the Nevada Highway Patrol. Dudley, as he was named, was taken to The Animal Foundation, at 655 N. Mojave Road, where vets determined he had likely been shot in the face.</p>
      <p>Animal Foundation veterinarian Dr. Ken Sieranski said Dudley had surgery Wednesday to remove bullet fragments and to adjust fractured teeth. The dog is now in recovery mode.</p>
      <p>NHP troopers said Friday morning that efforts to find the responsible person are ongoing.</p>
      <p>“Animal cruelty is a felony in Nevada, and these perpetrators need to be brought to justice,” Trooper Jason Buratczuk said Tuesday in a news release.</p>
      <p>Doug and another person gave Dudley a blanket and a bowl of water, which was already stained red with blood when a trooper arrived.</p>
      <p>“It’s unthinkable that someone would do something like this to an animal,” Buratczuk said.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know who the owner of this dog is,” he said. “If (Dudley) was shot, this is a crime.”</p>
      <h3>How to help</h3>
      <p>Anyone with information about Dudley’s owners may call the Highway Patrol at 702-486-4100 or The Animal Foundation at 702-384-3333. To leave an anonymous tip, call Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.</p>
