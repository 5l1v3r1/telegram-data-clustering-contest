      <h1>Obamacare's Legacy: ABC News Report Shows Healthcare Costs Skyrocketing Over Past Decade</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/guybenson" target="_blank">Guy Benson</a></address>
      <p>A short, simple post to close out the week.  As Democrats insist that the country accept their latest healthcare "solutions" -- including <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2018/07/31/liberals-respond-to-medicare-for-alls-astonishing-price-tag-byattacking-the-koch-brothers-n2505163">$35 trillion schemes</a> that would force every American onto a government system that massively expands, and makes mandatory, existing programs that are <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2019/04/23/aoc-on-the-va-if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-n2545159">already facing</a> fiscal and access crises -- it's very important to recall the last time they asked voters to trust them on this front.  Less than a decade ago, they introduced and rammed through Obamacare, which they insisted was a panacea with no drawbacks or policy tradeoffs.  It would expand coverage, yes, but most importantly, it would lower costs for everyone.  The plan was literally called the <i>Affordable</i> Care Act, after all.  How has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/middle-class-americans-crushed-rising-health-insurance-costs/story?id=67131097&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn">that been going</a>?</p>

      <blockquote>According to a new report by The Commonwealth Fund, <b>rising premium and deductibles contributions have outstripped wage growth over the past decade.</b> More and more middle-class Americans are paying a greater percentage of earnings for health care. The report analyzed survey data from 40,000 private-sector employers, as well as income data from the Census Bureau...In 2008, middle-class workers spent about 7.8% of household income on premiums and deductibles. By 2018, that figure had climbed to 11.5%.</blockquote>
      <p>This is a complex phenomenon, with multiple causes -- but the primary point of Obamacare was to arrest and reverse the cost trajectory. As we've been <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2017/05/25/its-failing-obamacare-premiums-on-federal-exchange-have-soared-by-105-percent-since-2013-n2331468">tracking for years</a> now, the animating goal and promise of the "Affordable" Care Act is a failure.  The Left will point to this as evidence of the need for single-payer healthcare, and call for a new, compulsory government monopoly.  Costs are just too high with the private sector, they'll say, and Obamacare didn't work because it tried to work with the existing healthcare industry, which was a fatal flaw.  So they'll push a <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2019/01/30/friendly-reminder-kamala-harris-singlepayer-scheme-would-rip-healthcare-plans-away-from-177-million-americans-n2540444">radical new plan</a>.  </p>
      <p>They'll demand that Americans agree to the government eliminating the private healthcare coverage of 180 million people, the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/kamala-harris-gambles-that-kicking-177-million-people-off-of-their-private-insurance-is-good-politics">vast majority</a> of whom are <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2019/10/30/poll-americans-satisfied-with-health-coverage-n2555518">satisfied</a> with their existing situations.  They'll demand that everyone pay much, <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2018/07/31/liberals-respond-to-medicare-for-alls-astonishing-price-tag-byattacking-the-koch-brothers-n2505163">much higher taxes</a>, while often hiding the ball on that reality in their rhetoric.  And they'll downplay <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2019/01/24/reality-bites-support-for-singlepayer-healthcare-craters-when-americans-discover-higher-taxes-longer-wait-times-n2539941">very real consequences</a> such as decreased access to care, government rationing of care, and a drop-off in medical innovation.  The Party of Government had one big bite at the healthcare apple, very recently.  They blew it, based on their own <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/03/14/obamacare-promises-then-vs-now-n1809186">standards and metrics</a>.  And now they'll insist that they just need to go much, much bigger.  Believe them this time, it'll be great.  You shouldn't, and it won't.</p>
