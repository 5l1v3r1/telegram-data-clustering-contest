        <b>ALEXANDRIA (Sputnik) - Russian national Alexei Burkov, who was recently extradited from Israel to the United States, is in good spirits and has no known medical issues, his lawyer Gregory Stambaugh told reporters.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"He is in good spirits", Stambaugh said. Asked if Burkov has any medical issues, Stambaugh replied: "None that I’m aware of".</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Burkov appeared for the third time before a US court. Russian national Alexei Burkov has pleaded not guilty to five counts related to alleged cybercrimes and is set to appear before a US jury next April, a Sputnik correspondent reported from a federal courtroom in Alexandria.</p>
      <blockquote>"I set the case for 21 April, 10 a.m. with a jury", Judge T.S. Ellis ruled during a hearing at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</blockquote>
      <p>When asked to enter his plea, Burkov through his lawyer refused to admit any wrongdoing, denying all five charges against him and entering a plea of "not guilty".</p>
      <p>Last week, the US court ordered Burkov to remain in custody because of the gravity of the charges. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201911201077355144-russian-diplomats-visit-russian-national-burkov-at-virginia-detention-center--embassy/">Russian diplomats visited Burkov</a> earlier this week at the detention facility in Virginia and said they were in constant contact with him as well as with his relatives and lawyer.</p>
      <p>Prior to his extradition to the United States, Burkov spent almost four years in Israeli jails petitioning unsuccessfully to be sent home while local authorities enforced a ban on his case in the media.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911121077291780-russian-national-burkov-faces-up-to-30-years-in-prison-if-convicted-in-us---prosecutor/">US authorities have charged Burkov</a> with running two websites for hackers, including one that was selling stolen bank card numbers used in more than $20 million worth of fraudulent purchases. The charges include wire fraud, computer intrusions, identity theft and money laundering.</p>
      <p>If convicted on all counts, Burkov faces a maximum prison sentence of 80 years. However, actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum prescribed penalties, according to the US Justice Department.</p>
