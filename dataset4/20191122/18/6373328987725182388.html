        <b>A Mexican church has erected the world’s biggest statue of Baby Jesus. But the real question is: does it look more like Phil Collins or Nicolas Cage?</b>
      </p>
      <p>At a hulking 22ft tall and weighing 2,000lb, the statue travelled 12 hours from the city of Chimalhuacán to La EpifanÍa del Señor church in the central Mexican state of Zacatecas.</p>
      <p>Crafted by Roman Salvador, it’s an impressive sculpture: but the prowess behind it is being overshadowed by its uncanny resemblance to both Phil Collins and <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/nicolas-cage-is-in-talks-to-star-in-a-movie-where-he-plays-nicolas-cage/">Nicolas Cage</a>.</p>

      <p>It does bear a hilariously uncanny resemblance to the former Genesis frontman, right down to the front tuft of hair à la his 1980s <i>Sussudio</i> days.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user even joked in response to the statue: ‘Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger, singing Su-sussudio.’</p>

      <p>However, facially, it does look quite a bit like the <i>Mandy</i> and <i>Face/Off</i> actor – who knew the Baby Jesus would be the love-child of two pop culture icons?</p>
      <p>Fortunately, in order to see what the consensus on the statue is, Laura Martínez posted a poll – and the results were very, very tight.</p>

      <p>Voters just favoured Cage over Collins, with 37% voting for him as opposed to 28% for the latter – however, it’s worth noting that 35% answered: ‘Dunno, he freaks me out’.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, people have been getting pretty creative with the statue online – one user photoshopped it into a Thanksgiving parade, while another turned it into <i>Child’s Play</i>‘s Chucky.</p>

      <p>Reverend Humberto Rodriguez told <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/church-builds-huge-baby-jesus-statue-that-looks-like-phil-collins/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter"><i>The New York Post</i> </a>that he had no intentions of commissioning the world’s biggest Baby Jesus.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rev. Rodriguez explained: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>There is a space of between 26ft between the ceiling and the floor and I ordered a statue measuring 21ft, but I never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world.</blockquote>
      <p>Made from fiberglass, resin, automotive paste and automotive paint, it completely towers the previous record holder, which stands at 16ft tall and weighing 661lbs.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is strictly limited to statues of Baby Jesus – the grown-up Messiah has much, much larger structures across the world.</p>

      <p>Everyone’s familiar with Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, which stands at a whopping 98ft – but it’s not the largest.</p>
      <p>To see the globe’s biggest towering Jesus, you’ll need to travel to Swiebodzin, Poland, where you’ll find ‘Christ Is King’ – standing at a massive 120ft tall.</p>
      <p>The statue makes sense to be fair – Collins and Cage are both gods in their own rights.</p>
