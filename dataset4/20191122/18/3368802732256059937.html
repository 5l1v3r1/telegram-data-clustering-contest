      <p>Sixty-year-old Abdur Rashid Bepari and his family members were on their way to Dhaka’s Kamrangirchar to have his son’s marriage registered yesterday.</p>
      <p>As their microbus reached Shoalghar area of Munshiganj’s Sreenagar upazila around 2:00pm, a speedy bus collided head-on with it, leaving at least nine, including Rashid and five others of the family, dead on the spot.</p>
      <p>Witnesses blamed reckless driving for the accident on the Dhaka-Mawa highway.</p>
      <p>The groom, Rubel Hossain, his brother Sohel Bepari and their other family members were in another microbus that was trailing behind.</p>
      <p>“There were 24 people in the bridal party. We had started in two microbuses from Rubel’s home in Kansar village [Munshiganj’s Louhajanj],” said Nazrul Islam, who was in the second microbus with Rubel.</p>
      <p>“The other microbus was about a kilometre away when it was hit by the bus,” he said, adding that all their happiness turned into grief in a matter of moments.</p>
      <p>The deceased were identified as Abdur Rashid Bepari, his daughter Liza, 22, Liza’s daughter Tabassum, 4, Rashid’s daughter-in-law Runa Akhter, 22, her son Tahsin, 3, Rashid’s niece Ranu, 12, their neighbours Mofizul, 30, Keramat Ali, 70, and microbus driver Billal.</p>
      <p>All of them were in the same microbus.</p>
      <p>The accident left 11 others injured. They were being treated at different hospitals in the capital.</p>
      <p>Officer-in-Charge Hedaytul Islam Bhuiyan of Sreenagar Police Station said the Mawa-bound Swadhin Paribahan bus from Dhaka was running at a high speed when the accident happened.</p>
      <p>Its driver and helper fled, the OC said, adding that both the vehicles were seized.</p>
      <p>Police recovered the bodies and sent those to Sreenagar Upazila Health Complex.</p>
      <p>After the accident, traffic movement on the busy highway remained halted for about half-an-hour.</p>

      <p>Quoting a few bus passengers, Abdul Based, in-charge of Hashara Post of the Highway Police, however, said the bus had lost control before the collision.</p>
      <p>Traffic Inspector (Mawa) Kawsar-e-Alam said the bus lost control after one of its tyres burst.</p>
      <p>At their home in Munshiganj’s Kansar village, Rubel and his relatives were overcome with grief. </p>
      <p>Nothing could console Sohel Bepari who lost his wife Runa and three-year-old son Tahsin.</p>
      <p> “Everything ended in moments,” he wailed in front of his home.</p>
      <p>The district administration gave the families of the dead Tk 20,000 each in compensation.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Zayedul Alam, superintendent of police in Munshiganj, said the process of filing a case was underway.</p>
      <p>A five-member team, headed by Additional Deputy Magistrate Asma Shahin, was formed to find out the cause of the accident, he added.</p>
