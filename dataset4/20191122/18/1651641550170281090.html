      <h1>Microsoft release Windows 10 20H1 Insider Preview Build 19030, removes watermark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:39:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Today Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview <b>Build 19030 (20H1)</b> to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>
      <p>The update is the first without a watermark, suggesting Microsoft is coming close to finishing off the OS, but of course, Microsoft warns they are not quite there yet.</p>
      <p>The update brings:</p>
      <h3>General changes, improvements, and fixes for PC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The build watermark at the lower right-hand corner of the desktop is no longer present in this build.</li>
        <li>Microsoft fixed an issue where if you started to reset your MSA pin from the sign-in screen and left it without interacting with it for some time, it would result in a black screen, requiring a reboot to recover.</li>
        <li>Microsoft fixed an issue that could result in night light settings getting lost on the primary monitor when the system is connected/disconnected from a secondary monitor.</li>
        <li>Microsoft fixed an issue that could result in an out of memory message when watching a long HEVC video.</li>
        <li>Microsoft fixed an issue resulting in certain apps not fully filling the screen when maximized in recent builds.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Knowns issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, Microsoft has applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details</a>.</li>
        <li>Microsoft is looking into reports of the update process hanging for extended periods of time when attempting to install a new build.</li>
        <li>Microsoft has heard that Settings still isn’t available outside of launching via the URI (ms-settings:) for some Insiders and are investigating.</li>
        <li>Some Insiders are reporting that after successfully installing printer drivers from the Optional Updates section, the same driver is still showing as available for install. Microsoft is looking into the issue.</li>
        <li>Microsoft is looking into reports of certain external USB 3.0 drives not responding with Start Code 10 or 38 after they’re attached.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The update is also bringing a number of changes to Cortana.</p>
      <h3>Cortana on Windows (Beta)–Now with more productivity!</h3>
      <p>Earlier this week, Microsoft rolled out some changes to Cortana on Windows for Insiders in the Fast ring. As part of evolving Cortana from a general digital assistant to a personal productivity assistant that helps you in the Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft has made several changes that will give you a glimpse into how your assistant will help you manage tasks and time and connect with people. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/cortana-as-a-productivity-aid/">Read more about these changes.</a></p>
      <p>Windows 10 Insiders in the Fast Ring can download Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 19030 by checking for the update in Settings.</p>
