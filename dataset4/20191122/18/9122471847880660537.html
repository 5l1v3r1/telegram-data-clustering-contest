      <h1>Texas at Baylor: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:56:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>After getting beaten at home by Oklahoma last week, No. 14 Baylor hopes to make up for it with a big win over Texas.</p>
      <p>At 9-1 on the season, the Bears need only one more win to clinch a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game. But unless they beat Oklahoma in that game and get a ton of outside help, their College Football Playoff dream will be over, if it isn’t already. Thanks to their <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28099946/sp+-rankings-week-12-battle-1-loss-teams">top 30 offense and defense</a>, there’s still reason to be optimistic, even after a <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/kirk-herbstreit-reacts-oklahoma-crazy-win-vs-baylor">brutal blown lead against the Sooners</a>.</p>
      <p>The Longhorns have lost three of their last five games, and are 2-3 outside of Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium. Now unranked, the Longhorns will need to win out and see several teams lose out to get into the Big 12 title game. But in all likelihood, their conference title dreams will end this weekend – win or lose.</p>
      <p>Baylor and Texas are both capable of putting up a ton of points, and have scored at least 30 points a combined 12 times. It should be a close game though, and the Bears have been named slight favorites in this one.</p>
      <p>Here are the details for the Texas vs. Baylor game:</p>

      <p>Texas heads into this game as winners of their last four against Baylor. But the Bears have been significantly better at McLane Stadium during this series, and are 2-2 there since 2011.</p>
      <p>Can Baylor end their losing streak against Texas this weekend?</p>
