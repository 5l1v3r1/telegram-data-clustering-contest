      <h2>Conference, provincial, and all-Canadian nods for slew of South Surrey athletes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/nick-greenizan/" target="_blank">Nick Greenizan</a></address>
      <p>Three members of Earl Marriott Secondary’s varsity football have earned provincial all-star recognition – the first time in more than a decade that more than two players from the team have been so honoured.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Sam La Roue, offensive tackle Jason Wang and linebacker Byron Ruvalcaba were all recently named to the 2019 B.C. Secondary Schools Football Association’s triple-A all-star team.</p>
      <p>The three honorees are the most that Earl Marriott – which has had a football program since 2005 – has had at that level since 2008, when two players, Ben Christy and Kyler Parkes, were named provincial all-stars.</p>
      <p>“It’s more than we’ve ever had – it’s been awhile since we had two – so it’s pretty neat,” said EMS head Michael Mackay-Dunn.</p>
      <p>South Delta quarterback Ben McDonald was named the provincial offensive MVP, while other all-stars included Seaquam Secondary offensive lineman Jaskirat Sanghera and Lord Tweedsmuir defensive lineman Kyle Todd.</p>
      <p>The B.C. all-star game is scheduled for Nov. 30, 2 p.m. at B.C. Place during provincial championship weekend. The day before, teams will practise at Cloverdale Athletic Park, while an all-star banquet is scheduled for Saturday night at the Langley Events Centre.</p>

      <p>All three were also named Pacific Conference all-stars, as well, alongside three other Mariners – receiver Isaiah Edwards, defensive lineman Erich Mueller and defensive back Dean Meurrens. Mueller was also named the most oustanding Grade 11 player on defence.</p>
      <p>As well, La Roue, Ruvalcaba and Meurrens were also selected to play in the Nissan All-Canadian Game, which is set for Calgary this weekend as part of the Canadian Football League’s Grey Cup weekend. The trio will also get to attend the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>“I’m really proud of the kids,” Mackay-Dunn said of his slew of all-stars.</p>
