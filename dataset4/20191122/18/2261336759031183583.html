      <h1>Jon Jones, Israel Adesanya trade barbs on Twitter: ‘I accomplish records you never came close to’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones and newly-minted UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya seem to be on a collision course with destiny.</p>
      <p>Their rivalry dates back to when Adesanya was first making a name for himself in 2018 and, since unifying the middleweight titles with a second-round knockout of Robert Whittaker at UFC 243, ‘The Last Stylebender’ has kicked things up a notch.</p>
      <p>Adesanya fired the first shots against Jones on Thursday, baiting the pound-for-pound No. 1 into a war of words on social media.</p>

      <p>“Be sure to tell your kids how I made my first million at age 23, let them know I accomplish records you never came close to. Let them know you had the chance to fight me but you didn’t want to get Mayweather’d and decided to make an excuse. Bro I’m done replying to you,” Jones posted in response to Adesanya’s meme.</p>

      <p>“Bro ur gaining some popularity, I’ve seen so many popular fighters come and go over these years. Statistically we’re nowhere on the same level, I’m going to start treating you that way. You get no more responses out of me until 2021, I’ll be interested to hear your excuse then,” the light heavyweight champ posted in his follow-up tweet.</p>
      <p>‘Bones’ then responded to a fan who implied that he was ‘triggered’ by Adesanya’s tweets.</p>

      <p>“Lol triggered? I’ve been seeing that same meme for like six years now. These fighters can’t criticize my actual artwork so they attacked my personal life. The only thing that’s annoying is the lack of originality,” he wrote in his final tweet.</p>
      <p>Jones and Adesanya are both expected to defend their respective titles in the new year, with Bones likely defending his light heavyweight strap against Dominick Reyes and Adesanya possibly putting his middleweight belt on the line against Yoel Romero.</p>
