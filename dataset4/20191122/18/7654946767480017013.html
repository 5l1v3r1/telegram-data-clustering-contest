      <h1>Florida man in ‘MAGA’ shirt robs bank, then gives some money back</h1>

      <p>A bank robber in a “Make America Great Again” T-shirt allegedly held up a Wells Fargo branch in Florida — but told a teller “you gave me too much” when she handed over $900 more than he’d asked for, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Sandy Hawkins, 73, of Boca Raton, wore a blue, short-sleeve shirt that said “Trump,” along with the president’s campaign slogan, as he passed a stickup note to a teller on Monday, <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191120/authorities-lsquoyou-gave-me-too-muchrsquo-robber-told-boca-bank-teller">the Palm Beach Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Give me $1,100 now. No alarms. Hope to get caught,” the note said, according to the paper.</p>
      <p>When the teller asked for his debit card, Hawkins said, “This is a robbery. I have a weapon,” before touching his waistband, according to an arrest report obtained by the outlet.</p>
      <p>The teller doled out $2,000 — prompting Hawkins to tell her he didn’t need all that, according to the report.</p>
      <p>So the teller handed him $1,100 in hundred-dollar bills, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The retired air conditioning worker was caught the next day when the manager of a nearby sports bar identified him as deputies examined surveillance footage.</p>
      <p>Upon his arrest, Hawkins told Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office investigators, “I will make this easy” — and then spilled his guts, according to the report.</p>
      <p>He handed them the tattered bank deposit slip he passed to the teller a day earlier, with his handwritten demand for cash.</p>
      <p>Hawkins was charged with robbery without a weapon and booked Tuesday into the Palm Beach County Jail, according to the local paper. Bond was set at $50,000 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Hawkins, originally from Detroit, has no criminal history, Assistant Public Defender Paul Caruso told the outlet, and Palm Beach County Court records don’t show any prior arrests.</p>
