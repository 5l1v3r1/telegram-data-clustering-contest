      <p>An on-duty police officer described the last moments of murder victim <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/live-bala-lloyd-evans-murder-17278797">Bala Lloyd-Evans</a>, saying "I did the best I could for him."</p>
      <p>PC Philip Parkinson was giving evidence on the fourth day of the trial of two men charged with the murder of Mr Lloyd-Evans, 33, who was stabbed in the heart while out celebrating Liverpool's Champions League win in the early hours of June 2.</p>
      <p>Stepbrothers Ramal Edwards, 19, of Emerson Street, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/toxteth">Toxteth</a>, and Kieran Perry, 25, of Wendell Street, Toxteth, both deny the murder.</p>
      <p>PC Parkinson told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/courts">Liverpool Crown Court</a> he was on patrol in the early hours of June 2 when he came upon a fight which had erupted in Back Colquitt Street.</p>

      <p>Under questioning from David McLachlan, QC, prosecuting, PC Parkinson said the fight had "calmed down" but then flared up again.</p>
      <p>He added: "I could see punches being thrown, but I didn't know who by. I didn't see any weapons."</p>
      <p>PC Parkinson said a man in a white top had started to run away, leaving another man on the ground. There was a large laceration across Bala’s chest and a lot of blood.</p>
      <p>The officer said: "I did the best I could for him."</p>
      <p>A crime scene was put in place and people moved out of the area.</p>
      <p>Dr Alison Armour, a Home Office pathologist, carried out a post-mortem examination on the body of Bala Lloyd-Evans.</p>
      <p>She said he was 5ft 7ins in height and was "of muscular build," weighing around 15 stone.</p>

      <p>Dr Armour said there were two significant injuries to the central chest area.</p>
      <p>The first was a stab wound which was 5.6cm in length to the central chest area which was directly in line with the nipples.</p>
      <p>This was the stab wound that caused Bala Lloyd-Evans' death.</p>
      <p>In addition, there was an incised wound, which was 12.2cm in length to the left side of the chest. It did not enter the chest cavity.</p>
      <p>Dr Armour explained in detail the path that the knife took as it entered Lloyd-Evans' body, completely severing two ribs.</p>

      <p>She estimated the depth of this wound to be up to 14cm, and that it would have required "considerable force" to inflict.</p>
      <p>The single stab wound to the chest penetrated the heart, causing catastrophic blood loss.</p>
      <p>Edwards has not disputed that he held the knife that caused the death of Mr Lloyd-Evans.</p>
      <p>He was chased by police officers before he was arrested, during which time he discarded the knife - a folding lock-knife with a single cutting edge.</p>
      <p>The knife was recovered from a location on Cornwallis Street, within the grounds of the Liverpool Workshops for the Outdoor Blind building.</p>
      <p>The knife, along with articles of Edwards' clothing, was forensically examined -  within the back left pocket of Edwards’ jeans was contact blood staining from Mr Lloyd Evans’ blood.</p>
