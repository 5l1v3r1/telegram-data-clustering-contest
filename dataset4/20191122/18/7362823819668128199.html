      <h1>Varney likens Sanders, Warren to controversial figure: 'On both sides of the Atlantic, the socialists will lose'</h1>

      <p>Fox Business host Stuart Varney likened 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to the leader of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">Britain's</a> Labour Party and issued a strong warning to outspoken socialists in his <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/9db8abb5bcf922941156986a2377e21f/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=DailyShowMyTake_Article_FNC_Platform">Fox Nation show "My Take." </a></p>
      <blockquote>"I'm happy to say that on both sides of the Atlantic, the socialists will lose."<cite>— Stuart Varney, Fox Business host</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"It is amazing how similar Britain's Jeremy Corbyn is to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren," Varney said. "They are in lockstep. This is not the kind of special relationship I would prefer, but I'm happy to say that on both sides of the Atlantic, the socialists will lose."</p>
      <p>"Mark that down," he reiterated, "Corbyn, Sanders, Warren. They will lose."</p>
      <p>Varney said the "baselines of Anglo-American socialism revolves around anger at the rich, and jealousy of wealth."</p>
      <p>"Corbyn reversed business tax cuts, raised taxes on high-income people, raised the estate tax, a new tax on oil companies, and he takes special aim at billionaires. That's almost exactly the same as the Warren-Sanders tax plans. Right down to the hit on freeloading billionaires," said the Fox Business host.</p>
      <p>According to Varney, the trio sees eye to eye on most issues, including climate policy, healthcare, and tax plans.</p>

      <p>"How about climate policy?" Varney asked. "Hardly any difference. The Green New Deal here is a lot like what they call the Green Transformation over there. Drastic cuts in emissions in a very short time. Everybody switch to electric cars. Tax the fossil fuel industry to death and spend, spend, spend on anything green.</p>
      <p>"Corbin, Warren and Sanders all see dire climate predictions as a socialist opportunity. Giveaways...free college here. And of course, the Brits already have free healthcare. Warren and Sanders want the same free health care here. Good luck," he said.</p>
      <p>"And here's another similarity. Neither the Brits nor Americans want the radical transformation that the socialists demand. Massive tax hikes and a forced green revolution do not bring prosperity. They bring recession, perhaps depression and certainly national decline. And investors, voters, they know it.</p>
      <p>"The special socialist relationship will disappear when the votes are counted," Varney concluded, "and that's a wonderful thing."</p>
