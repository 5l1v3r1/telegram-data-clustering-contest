      <h1>GPs vote to scrap home visits from their contracts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mason Boycott-Owen, Laura Donnelly, Health Editor</a></address>
      <p>Doctors have voted to scrap home visits by GPs, prompting accusations that they are abandoning the frail and elderly.</p>
      <p>The landmark vote, at a British Medical Association (BMA) conference, came after medics complained that they were wasting too much time driving around the country.</p>
      <p>GPs said such visits caused them too much aggravation, and complaints, while others said they feared for their safety when they entered patients’ homes.</p>
      <p>Around 300 delegates, representing GPs across England, made the shock decision yesterday to try to remove the duty from their standard contract.</p>
      <p>Medics at the conference of Local Medical Committees in London said it was time to make it clear that “enough is enough” saying they were overloaded.  </p>
      <p>The union will now lobby the next Government, seeking to see the duties outsourced to other parts of the NHS, or to see GPs paid extra for carrying out such work. </p>
      <p>Dr Andrew Parkin, from Kent LMC, who proposed the motion, said home visits ‘'[take] two to three hours a day for the majority. They cause the most friction, complaints and litigation.</p>
      <p>“You have the most highly trained, endangered, and in-demand people in primary care driving around 25 square miles to see two patients an hour, and in the case of rural colleagues, maybe only one.”</p>
      <p>He was backed by Dr Brian McGregor, who told the conference, to rapturous applause: "We are going to stand up, put up, and tell the government that we have had enough and we cannot do this anymore."</p>
      <p>Dr David Turner, from Hertfordshire, called home visits “an indulgence of time we can rarely afford.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, the chairman of the BMA’s GP committee urged medics to encourage other doctors to refuse unmanageable workloads. Dr Richard Vautrey told delegates: “You have an important lesson to offer and a word to teach them. You need to help them to say “No”.’</p>
      <p>Several GPs who spoke in favour of scrapping home visits for patients, many of whom are frail and elderly, cited fears that they could be attacked or even killed by patients.</p>
      <p>Dr Deborah White, from Cleveland, said: "A patient's home is not a safe environment to make a clinical assessment," describing concerns about broken lights and “dogs licking at your heels”.</p>
      <p>Charities and patients groups expressed alarm about the vote.</p>
      <p>The move means that GPs, with average earnings of £105,000 for partners, will lobby the next government to remove home visits from their core contract, meaning extra money for those who do take on the duties. </p>
      <p>Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said: "I am absolutely horrified. When you think of the people who rely on home visits - the frail, the elderly, the vulnerable - it is just awful to think that GPs no longer think visiting them is part of their job."</p>
      <p>"It is just awful and very frightening for patients. We need to be able to rely on our own GPs."</p>
      <p>Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: “Some frail and vulnerable older people are likely to be alarmed that the future of GP home visits is even being questioned.</p>
      <p>“For older people in this position, knowing that you can call out a GP if you absolutely need one provides a precious feeling of reassurance, even if you never actually have to do it.</p>
      <p>Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, said that health officials from NHS England would have to find a way to make sure patients who needed home visits got medical attention. </p>
      <p>Tory sources said a Conservative government would be "strongly opposed" to the dropping of home visits from the standard contract while Labour declined to comment on the decision.</p>
