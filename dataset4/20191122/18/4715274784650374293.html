      <p>“Watching Knowledge Channel helped me become a salutatorian. I am more eager to learn and the teaching is more effective,” she said. </p>
      <p>Nabella, who was featured at the recent celebration of KCFI’s 20th anniversary on <i>ASAP Natin ‘To</i></p>
      <p>, is just one of the many students that the foundation’s shows and programs have helped throughout the years.  </p>
      <p>“In 20 years, millions of students from 7,000 public schools across the country have learned and are continuously learning through the effective and fun way of learning made available by KCFI through educational videos and technology,” KCFI president and executive director <b>Rina Lopez-Bautista </b></p>
      <p>said. </p>
      <p>Knowledge Channel, the television platform of the foundation, is known for educational shows and programs that emphasize teaching and learning. </p>
      <p>They also feature some Kapamilya stars like <b>Enchong</b> <b>Dee</b> for <i>Agricoolture</i>, <b>Maymay Entrata</b> and <b>Khalil</b> <b>Ramos</b> for <i>Puno ng Buhay</i>, <b>Marlo Mortel</b> for the educational game show <i>Knowledge on the Go!, MathDali</i> with <b>Robi Domingo</b> and the animation show <i>Wikaharian</i>, with Teacher <b>Michelle Agas</b></p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>Knowledge Channel also paid tribute to the teachers who have been the foundation’s partners in shaping the future of the children. Among the valiant teachers who persevere in making an impact on the minds of their students is Blessilda Grace Patnon, a teacher from Dila Elementary School in Santa Rosa, Laguna who was featured on the Sunday variety show.</p>
      <p>“In being given the opportunity to be included as one of the beneficiaries of Knowledge Channel, I can truly say how much of a positive impact it has been in our students because education is made easier, interactive, and holistic. All of us teachers are grateful for the assistance given by Knowledge Channel Foundation,” Blessilda said.    </p>
      <p>But KCFI’s mission still continues. “A lot of things has been enacted, and there’s still a lot that can be done. Join us and be a Knowledge champion,” Lopez-Bautista said as she sought the support of viewers.</p>
      <p>Completing the celebration on <i>ASAP Natin ‘To</i> was a musical highlight, which featured the <i>Voices</i> <i>Iuvenes</i> children’s choir, along with the <b>TNT Boys</b>, and <b>Piolo</b> <b>Pascual </b>who sang the <b>APO Hiking Society </b></p>
      <p>classic, “Bawat Bata.”</p>
