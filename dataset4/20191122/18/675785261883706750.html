      <h1>Fiona Bruce's reality TV hell and why she took on Jeremy Clarkson over bum comment</h1>
      <h2>The Question Time and Antiques Roadshow host will oversee tonight's leaders' debate between Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:20:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>As the host of Question Time and regular face of both the News at Six and the News at 10, Fiona Bruce is one of the nation's most respected news readers.</p>
      <p>For more than 20 years she has also hosted Antiques Roadshow - and now she will take on a special Question Time Leaders' special tonight.</p>
      <p>She will be responsible for marshalling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon at 7pm on BBC One.</p>
      <p>Each leader will take on questions from the live studio audience over the two hour debate and each will be allocated 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>It's just three days since Tory leader Boris and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader Jeremy went head-to-head on ITV and emotions are certain to be running high.</p>

      <p>After taking over from David Dimbleby as the presenter of Question Time in January this year, Fiona Bruce's cool head will be vital in keeping the leaders in check.</p>
      <p>And while she is one of the most famous women in the country, Bruce has refused to take part in reality TV following a disatrous experience in 2006.</p>
      <p>She appeared on the BBC's Just The Two Of Us - and has sworn off reality TV for life.</p>
      <p>Fiona was partnered with Alexander O'Neal on the show, which was hosted by husband and wife team Tess Daly and Vernon Kay.</p>
      <p>Following her appearance she vowed "never again" and has turned down every other offer to take part in further reality TV.</p>

      <p>It didn't stop her from appearing on Top Gear twice - and taking on Jeremy Clarkson when he made a comment about her "nice bum".</p>
      <p>Fiona was a fierce campaigner for women's rights when she was a student at Oxford University.</p>
      <p>She ran women's groups and ever camped at Greenham Common, a peace camp to protest against nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>But when she appeared on Top Gear in 2007, Fiojna shared a lift with Clarkson and had to push him out when he got stuck on a Peel P50.</p>
      <p>As she was walking away, Clarkson said - without her being aware - "she has got quite a nice bottom, I said that out loud, didn't I?"</p>

      <p>Returning to the series the following year, along with Kate Silverton in the segment Star in a Reasonably Sized Car, she got her own back at the presenter, who was later sacked from the show.</p>
      <p>She slapped Clarkson's bottom and added that it "needs a bit of work".</p>
      <p>And that wasn't all - Fions stands in for Clarkson in his Sunday Times car review colum and has described it as the ultimate revenge for what he said about her.</p>
      <p>She said: "Perching my bottom, nice or otherwise, on his patch."</p>
      <p>In 2010 she was awarded the Rear Of The Year, which she described as "demeaning".</p>
      <p>However, she insists her feminist credentials are still as key now, albeit changed.</p>
      <p>Fiona told The Guardian: "There are certainly things I would have done differently then to how how I do them now.</p>
      <p>That's why I talk about feminism being a spectrum."</p>
      <p>Fiona is married to Nigel Sharrocks and the couple have a son, Sam, and daughter, Mia Rose.</p>
