      <p>The government is raising awareness of bullying supports during Bullying Awareness Week, Nov. 18th-22nd.</p>
      <p>“We are taking a stand against bullying. Bullying rates in Canada are higher than two-thirds of western countries,” notes a release. “It can consist of mean, cruel, hurtful behaviours done on an ongoing basis. It can happen verbally, physically, socially or online.</p>
      <p>“In all its forms, it leaves a mark on its victims, no matter their age. With bullying so prevalent in our communities, it is up to each of us to do our part in its prevention and promote healthy relationships,” saidRajan Sawhney, minister of Community and Social Services.</p>
      <p>During Bullying Awareness Week, from Nov. 18th to Nov. 22nd, the Province is running a digital campaign to show victims and bystanders of bullying where they can turn if they need support.</p>
      <p>The campaign will help raise awareness of what resources are available for people affected by bullying.</p>
      <p>No one should have to experience bullying. Regardless of where bullying happens, whether it’s at work, school, home or in a community, help is always available.</p>
      <p>“We’re working hard to put an end to bullying by raising awareness of resources and also empowering victims and bystanders to learn how to deal with bullying. We can all work together to promote healthy relationships and help those in need,” said Sawhney.</p>
      <p>Every student in our province deserves to learn in a welcoming, respectful and safe learning environment.</p>
      <p>“I encourage everyone involved in our education system to continue to be proactive in preventing bullying and supporting students, families and staff throughout the year,” said Adriana LaGrange, minister of education.</p>
      <p>This year’s campaign focuses on a wide range of year-round supports and services available to people experiencing bullying, and bystanders. These include:</p>
      <p>– The Bullying Helpline (1-888-456-2323), an anonymous helpline available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.</p>
      <p>– The Bullying Helpline Chat available daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. at Alberta.ca/BullyingChat.</p>
      <p>More information on Bullying Awareness Week and events taking place across the province can be found at www.alberta.ca/bullying.</p>
