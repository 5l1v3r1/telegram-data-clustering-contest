      <p>A total of 48 Superstars will compete in matches at the 2019 <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Survivor Series pay-per-view, including 16 from the NXT brand.</p>
      <p>The featured matches at the upcoming event include Brock Lesnar vs. Rey Mysterio (WWE Championship), “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt vs. Daniel Bryan (Universal Championship) and Adam Cole vs. TBC (NXT Championship), while five RAW vs. SmackDown vs. NXT matches are also scheduled for the show.</p>
      <p>Despite the large amount of Superstars who have been booked for this year’s battle of brand supremacy, there are still several high-profile names who are set to miss out on the event for a variety of reasons.</p>
      <p>In this article, let’s count down five Superstars who have been omitted from Survivor Series and take a look at the likely reasons why they will not be competing on the show.</p>

      <h4>#5 Aleister Black</h4>

      <p><b>Reason for Survivor Series absence:</b> <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/aleister-black">Aleister Black</a> was confronted by Buddy Murphy on the latest episode of RAW in what appeared to be the start of a rivalry between the two men. With Survivor Series largely revolving around Champions, Black’s only realistic way of participating in a match would have been for him to represent RAW in the five-on-five-on-five elimination match, but he has recently been sidelined <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-rumors-real-reason-why-aleister-black-has-not-been-allowed-to-wrestle-revealed">due to a knee injury</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Chances of appearing on the show:</b> We have seen various Superstars appear in the invasion angles on RAW, SmackDown and NXT in recent weeks, even though they are not set to feature at Survivor Series. Black, however, has kept a relatively low profile, so it seems unlikely that he will show up on Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>Possible future storyline:</b> As we saw on Monday, it is clear that WWE is heading towards a match between Black and Murphy on a future episode of RAW. Murphy defeated Akira Tozawa on this week’s RAW, so the Aussie goes into the storyline with some momentum.</p>
