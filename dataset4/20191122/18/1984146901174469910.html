      <h2>Phil Parkinson knows what he wants in January, as he looks to fire up Sunderland for a promotion challenge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Phil Parkinson has spelled out Sunderland's priorities as he prepares for what is shaping up to be a make-or-break January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats</a> have been well off the automatic promotion pace so far this season and the squad's deficiencies have been laid bare - particularly in the final third of the pitch where <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/will-grigg">Will Grigg</a> has been out of form and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-wyke">Charlie Wyke</a> and the on-loan <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/marc-mcnulty">Marc McNulty</a> have struggled with injuries.</p>
      <p>New boss <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> took over last month and will have the opportunity to bring in reinforcements in the New Year in an attempt to ignite a promotion challenge.</p>
      <p>After winning promotion from League One with Colchester United and Bolton Wanderers, Parkinson knows what it takes to get out of the third tier.</p>
      <p>And his nine games at the helm in all competitions on Wearside have seen him utilise 25 players, meaning he now knows exactly what he has to work with until January and what areas must be addressed in the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Sunderland are already keeping an eye on transfer targets but Parkinson is wary of giving away too much, given that he needs to coax performances out of the players he already has at his disposal over the course of the next six games until the window opens - and in reality over a longer period, given that deals are likely to be done throughout January.</p>
      <p>"It's a case of adding to what we have got, and I think everybody can see that we need a bit of pace and a bit of power at the top of the pitch," said Parkinson.</p>

      <p>"We have to make sure that defenders find it difficult to play against our front players.</p>
      <p>"We know what we need to aim for and we are monitoring the players we are looking at, but equally I don't want to make too big a thing about it at the moment because I want to get more out of the players we have got."</p>
      <p>The key for Parkinson will be to keep Sunderland in touch with the sides at the top of the table over the coming weeks until he can make changes during the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Sunderland go into tomorrow's home game against Coventry City two points shy of the play-off places, eight points from the automatic promotion spots, and 11 points behind leaders Wycombe - albeit the Black Cats have at least one game in hand of all-but two of the eight clubs above them in the table.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: "I've been promoted before and I know what it takes to be at the top of this league.</p>
      <p>"Fine dividing lines separate the top two from the top six, and the top six from the top eight, and we have to make sure that we are on the right side of those lines.</p>
      <p>"I've got a very clear picture in my mind about how we achieve that, both with the personnel within the building and possibly from outside through recruitment."</p>
