      <h1>Coldplay no-tour plan highlights growing climate awareness</h1>

      <p>British band Coldplay on Friday won plaudits for shelving a new album tour over environmental concerns, in the latest sign of climate change activism in the music industry.</p>
      <p>The World Wildlife Fund praised the move, as the group released its latest album — “Everyday Life” — with only two gigs, both in the Jordanian capital Amman.</p>
      <p>The performances, staged at sunrise and sunset without an audience, were broadcast free on YouTube.</p>
      <p>“It is fantastic to see world famous artists stepping up to protect the planet,” said the head of climate change at WWF, Gareth Redmond-King.</p>
      <p>“We all have a responsibility to lead by example in the face of this climate and nature crisis — inaction is not an option if we are to preserve our planet for future generations.”</p>
      <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin told the BBC they would not tour until they had figured out how concerts could be more “sustainable”.</p>
      <p>He listed the amount of flying required and the use of items such as plastic water bottles as the band’s primary concerns over touring.</p>
      <p>Activists say international music tours impact heavily on the environment, with concern about the amount of electricity used to power stadiums to waste generated by concert-goers.</p>
      <p>Coldplay played 122 shows around the world across eight legs as part of the tour for their last album, “A Head Full of Dreams”.</p>
      <p>Martin said if the band do eventually hit the road for the new release, they hope the tour could be entirely carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>The band is set to perform another one-off concert next Monday at London’s Natural History Museum, with the proceeds donated to an environmental charity.</p>
      <h3>– Cleaning up their acts –</h3>
      <p>Coldplay’s decision is the latest example of bands and the wider entertainment industry responding to growing concern about the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>US teenage sensation Billie Eilish revealed last month that she had tried to make her world tour “as green as possible” with the help of a non-profit consultancy.</p>
      <p>The singer told chat-show host Jimmy Fallon she had banned plastic straws and urged fans to bring their own refillable water bottles and to utilise recycling bins at venues.</p>
      <p>On her next world tour starting in March, every site will feature an “eco-village” where concert-goers can learn about environmentalism, she said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile The 1975, another British band, which this year collaborated with Swedish climate change icon Greta Thunberg, are also trying to move towards carbon-neutral touring.</p>
      <p>It pledged in September to plant a tree for every ticket sold ahead of their upcoming tour of Britain and Ireland.</p>
      <p>Teenage activist Thunberg refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved. In September, she travelled to a UN climate conference in New York by boat. She is currently sailing back to Europe.</p>
      <p>In Britain, live music events account for 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse emissions, according to the campaign group Global Citizen, which stages its own zero-waste festivals.</p>
      <p>Powerful Thinking, a think-tank focused on the festival industry, estimates the events generate some 23,500 tonnes of waste each year in the country.</p>
      <p>This has led dozens of Britain’s biggest festivals to try to clean up their acts, initiating everything from bans on single-use plastic to using renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p>The UK Music umbrella group representing the industry said 3.9 million people attended festivals in Britain in 2016.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury Festival, staged every June on a farm in western England, is partnering with charities such as Greenpeace, Oxfam and WaterAid to improve its sustainability.</p>
      <p>Organisers even deployed portable toilets that utilise technology to convert urine into electricity at this year’s festival.</p>
