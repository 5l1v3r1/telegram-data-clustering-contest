      <p>BELLEFONTE, Pa. — Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky entered court Friday in a yellow jumpsuit, hands cuffed in front of him, to be resentenced for sexually abusing children.</p>
      <p>Sandusky, 75, will be sentenced by Judge Maureen Skerda at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte.</p>
      <p>A state appeals court this year turned down most of Sandusky’s arguments seeking a new trial but said laws mandating sentence minimums in place at the time of his October 2012 sentencing have since changed.</p>
      <p>Under the new law, according to Jacklin Rhoads, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a jury would not have the power to go below the minimum sentence.</p>
      <p>The Superior Court opinion in February cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said any fact that increases the sentence for a given crime must be submitted to jurors and established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
      <p>Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years. It’s unclear whether Skerda will issue a significantly different sentence.</p>
      <p>Court filings in recent weeks indicate there may also be argument about Sandusky’s designation as a sexually violent predator.</p>
      <p>Eight young men testified during the 2012 trial that Sandusky, who founded a charity for at-risk youth, subjected them to a range of abuse, from grooming to violent attacks.</p>
      <p>Sandusky has always maintained his innocence, and his lawyers in October initiated a federal court action seeking a new trial or release from prison.</p>
      <p>His November 2011 arrest prompted the firing of Hall of Fame head coach Joe Paterno and the ousting of then-university President Graham Spanier.</p>
      <p>The university has subsequently paid more than $100 million to people who said they had been abused by Sandusky.</p>
