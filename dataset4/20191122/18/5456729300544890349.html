      <p>Justice Okon Abang of Federal High Court in Abuja, on Friday, adjourned till November 29 ruling on the bail application of Faisal Maina.</p>
      <p>Mr Maina is the son of Abdurasheed Maina, the former director of the federal government pension task force.</p>
      <p>He was arrested alongside his father in September. The father is accused of diverting N100 billion of pension funds.</p>
      <p>His son is accused by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of operating an account with the UBA which he used to divert various sums of money, including N58 million.</p>
      <p>The duo was arraigned on October 25 on separate charges. They pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>While the judge on October 25 ordered that Abdulrasheed Maina be remanded in Kuje Correctional Service centre, he ordered the anti-graft agency to keep Faisal in police custody at Police Tactical Squad, Asokoro, based on the investigation on allegation of possession of firearms and resistance to arrest.</p>
      <h4>Court session</h4>
      <p>Mr Abang made the date known after taking arguments from the EFCC and Mr Maina’s lawyer.</p>
      <p>The judge also adjourned to November 26, to enable the defence counsel, Francis Oronsaye, conclude his argument on his reply on the point of law and for trial continuation.</p>
      <p>“The matter is also adjourned to November 26 for ruling on the objection and again for the continuation of trial, ” Mr Abang said.</p>
      <p>He ordered the prosecution counsel, Mohammed Abubakar, to submit copies of ”judicial authorities reported in law pavilion, electronic law report, on or before the close of work on November 25”.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES had reported how Mr Abang had, on November 6, fixed November 7 for hearing of Faisal’s bail application.</p>
      <p>However, the judge could not take the bail application on the said date and later fixed today for the hearing.</p>
