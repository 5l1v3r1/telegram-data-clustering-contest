      <p>According to PM News, the court agreed to Dasukiâ€™s request for a variation in the terms attached to the bail earlier granted him.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the three-man panel of the court expunged the requirement that Dasuki produced a Level 16 civil servant who must own a property worth N100 million within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).</p>
      <p>Justice Stephen Adah, in the lead judgement, said it was wrong for courts to ask a civil servants to stand as surety when bail was granted.</p>
