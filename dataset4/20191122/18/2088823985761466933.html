      <p>SUNRISE, Fla. – Ralph Krueger did not take the loss Thursday night in Boston lightly.</p>
      <p>The Buffalo Sabres coach described the 3-2 setback as "painful" and called the performance at 5 on 5 their "best of the season." His players, meanwhile, were not interested in settling for a silver lining. This was the second consecutive game a forward failed to score and the penalty allowed a goal for a seventh consecutive game.</p>
      <p>The Sabres' offensive struggles have fans calling for Jack Eichel to be reunited with Jeff Skinner. Let's start there with my latest mailbag, which features questions submitted by readers on Twitter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>@HockeyIQ716: Why hasn't Krueger reunited Eichel and Skinner?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lance Lysowski:</b> There has been some revisionist history with how well that line performed last season. Sure, there's no disputing their success offensively. The Sabres had a 51.82% shot differential at 5 on 5 and produced 53 even-strength goals with Eichel and Skinner on the ice together last season.</p>
      <p>However, the line was deficient defensively. The Sabres' improved play without the puck is what separates this team from the one that finished 27th in the NHL last season.</p>
      <p>Krueger has prioritized having at least one above-average defender on each of his forward lines this season, which makes Victor Olofsson or Jimmy Vesey a logical wing for Eichel and Sam Reinhart.</p>
      <p>The thinking there is Olofsson or Vesey will free Eichel and Reinhart up to take more risks. It might be time to make a change, though. Reinhart has the ability to drive his own line. Krueger could pair Skinner with Eichel and have either Olofsson or Vesey at right wing.</p>
      <p>Krueger does not sound interested in making such a change, but he's found ways to use the two star forwards together at 5 on 5. With Eichel and Skinner on the ice together in 27:39 at 5 on 5, the Sabres have generated 11 more shot attempts than their opponents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rob Gregoretti: How likely is it that General Manager Jason Botterill can make a trade that helps the Sabres now and long-term since he waited until now?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lysowski: </b>The Sabres bolstered their blue line this offseason by adding Colin Miller and Henri Jokiharju. That provided them with the depth and competition they needed during training camp. Remember, the situation on defense was so dire last season that Matt Tennyson played NHL games for this team.</p>
      <p>Rasmus Ristolainen put the Sabres in a very difficult position by publicly expressing frustration, and let's face it, the 25-year-old played poorly last season. Botterill wasn't going to settle for a lesser return, and the intent was to compete this season. Selling low on Ristolainen would be counterproductive. Additionally, Marco Scandella's trade value was quite low after how he played last season.</p>
      <p>The Sabres have a good problem right now, and no one could have predicted they would be hit with this many injuries at once. The narrative is far different if Tage Thompson was able to contribute upon being called up from Rochester. A trade is inevitable given the salary-cap situation and the team's need at forward.</p>
      <p>However, trades are far more difficult to complete in November. In hindsight, the Sabres could have used another forward this offseason, but nothing materialized on the trade front after they acquired Vesey.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matt Weiner: Is the cap for the team next year as beneficial for the Sabres as we keep hearing? How much is realistically going to change between this year and next?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lysowski:</b> Yes, the Sabres are projected to have more than $33 million in space next season, according to CapFriendly.com. A significant chunk of that will likely be paid to Reinhart and Brandon Montour. Additionally, the Sabres could be interested in re-signing Vesey, Conor Sheary, Johan Larsson and Zemgus Girgensons. Casey Mittelstadt and Evan Rodrigues are also pending restricted free agents.</p>
      <p>Cap space quickly disappears when you're talking about potentially committing a combined $14 million to $16 million to Reinhart and Montour, plus Botterill will need to save enough room to sign Rasmus Dahlin to a long-term contract. Still, the Sabres are set up nicely to add through trades and free agency next summer.</p>
      <p>We've seen how much can change in one summer. Despite the Sabres' recent struggles, their roster is significantly deeper with Miller, Jokiharju and Marcus Johansson, all of whom were added this past offseason.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Justin Dickenson: What are your thoughts on the the Sabres' ability to target potential players in trades? Detroit seemed to pay a low price for Robby Fabbri.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lysowski:</b> That hasn't been the issue. The Sabres successfully bought low on Jokiharju and Miller, though it's odd the latter has been a healthy scratch as of late. Additionally, Botterill somehow acquired Montour for Brendan Guhle, who has struggled to stay on the ice in Anaheim.</p>
      <p>Botterill isn't to blame for this recent slide, in my opinion. I know fans will never get over the Ryan O'Reilly trade, but the Sabres were going nowhere with him on the roster. Trading O'Reilly allowed them to acquire Skinner and Miller, among others. The Sabres lacked depth because of former General Manager Tim Murray's impatience. You can't speed up a rebuild.</p>
      <p>Fans have every right to be losing patience. However, Botterill has done a nice job under difficult circumstances. The problem is on the ice. Aside from Eichel, the Sabres' best players have been inconsistent from shift to shift during this recent slide. Neither Botterill nor Krueger can force them to make better decisions with the puck.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nick Alberga: What leads you to believe that the Sabres aren't Sabres-ing again?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lysowski: </b>This situation is far different than last season. The Sabres were horrible defensively during their 10-game win streak last November. You're not seeing the same amount of odd-man rushes or defensive-zone breakdowns.</p>
      <p>The Sabres allowed only one 5-on-5 goal during their 3-2 loss in Boston on Thursday night. Their goaltending has also been more consistent. The biggest question is how they respond to adversity. They seem to lose energy following a difficult goal against and continue to struggle with consistency.</p>
      <p>The leadership group is stronger than years past, buoyed by the maturity of Eichel and the addition of a veteran like Johansson. Krueger also appears to be the ideal coach for this group because he has an innate ability to motivate.</p>
      <p>The Sabres are talented and have shown they have the formula to win, yet their play is unpredictable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Janusz Urbanski: Is Eichel the true leader of the team?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lysowski:</b> Absolutely. Eichel's effort on the ice can inspire his teammates. You saw that with his decision to drop the gloves Tuesday night against the Minnesota Wild. Eichel has also been the Sabres' most consistent player, having contributed on seven consecutive goals. He's also put in the work to improve defensively, and he's starting to shoot the puck more.</p>
      <p>Sure, Eichel has committed some defensive lapses, and yes, he can commit turnovers when trying to do too much. But Sabres fans have to love the way his game has evolved. Eichel is also quick to defend his teammates, and we're not seeing some of the bad body language that popped up at times last season.</p>
      <p>Eichel is constantly communicating and encouraging his teammates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scott: Do you think the Sabres would have had more success had they landed Mike Babcock instead of Dan Bylsma?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lysowski:</b> Yes, I do. Babcock is a tremendous coach. He would have worked wonders with the Sabres' young core. Bylsma's inability to communicate with players prevented them from adopting the habits that are needed at this level. The hire looked great on paper, though.</p>
      <p>Bylsma won a Stanley Cup in Pittsburgh and was beloved by the Penguins during his time there. However, I was told by a former Penguins player that he and his teammates grew tired of Bylsma, who seemed distracted late in his time there. Fit and timing are as important as the resume when it comes to coaching hires. Babcock would have checked all the boxes.</p>
