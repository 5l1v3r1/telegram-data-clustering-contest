      <h1>Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton Almost Went as Themselves for Halloween</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:02:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author">Aria Darcella</a></address>
      <p><i>Vogue</i>‘s “<a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kim-kardashian-west-life-in-looks-juicy-couture-skims-video">Life In Looks</a>” video series is the gift that keeps on giving. After Cher’s <a href="https://fashionweekdaily.com/cher-eau-de-couture-fragrance/">quippy installment</a>, Kim Kardashian is now the one in the hot seat — and she was more than game to rip in to her early fashion looks. First up was a classic paparazzi shot of herself and Paris Hilton carrying enormous Louis Vuitton bags. “This is literally one of my favorite, most iconic looks,” she mused. “This is what Paris and I were gonna be for Halloween this year, but we ran out of time. I think we need to do this next year. How fun would that be?”</p>
      <p>“I still have those bags,” she added, before dropping a some Hilton trivia. “Paris does not take care of her purses. If you see what’s inside of her bag, there is a million things, from every kind of makeup, lashes, just everything. It’s like a pharmacy… So, I would not let her put anything inside of this bag. It is an empty bag that she’s carrying [in this picture], fun fact.”</p>

      <p>Later, Kardashian opens up about her first trip to the Met gala, for which she wore a dress by Riccardo Tisci. Adding to her insecurity about feeling unwanted (she wasn’t personally invited, but attended as Kanye West’s plus one), she wasn’t entirely on-board with Tisci’s decision to go with a floral pattern over black. Tisci’s logic was that the pattern was emblematic of gifting a pregnant woman with flowers — fitting, as Kardashian was pregnant at the time. “It was such a sweet message, how Ricardo described it. But I was so insecure, and I could never really speak up at that point because I was so shy and just wanted to make everyone happy.” For what it’s worth, she now loves the look.</p>
