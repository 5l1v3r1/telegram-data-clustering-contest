      <p>Ozbilgen was charged with allegedly possessing sexual images depicting children. Authorities also considered him a person of interest in the October 30 <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/crazy/apparent-boyfriend-of-missing-woman-has-been-charged-in-child-porn-case/">disappearance</a> of his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Parze, 25. In <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/crazy/child-porn-suspect-sent-ex-girlfriend-angry-texts-night-before-she-disappeared-prosecutors/">a bid to keep him locked up during his child porn case</a>, prosecutors said he sent her angry messages the night before she disappeared, and that he was also charged with allegedly attacking her in September. The state didn’t get their way, however. Ozbilgen was released.</p>
      <p>“My client, John Ozbilgen, was discovered by his parents, Joe and Cindy Ozbilgen, this morning deceased in their residence. John Ozbilgen took his own life,” the defendant’s attorney <b>Robert Honecker</b> said in a statement obtained by Law&amp;Crime. “His family is emotionally distraught and heartbroken. He was facing a charge of child pornography which he strongly denied and maintained his innocence. He was released from custody on that charge and returned home.”</p>
      <p>Honecker noted that prosecutors viewed Ozbilgen as a person of interest in Parze’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>“However, at the time of his death, no charges relating to her disappearance were filed against John Ozbilgen,” he said.</p>
      <p>Investigators are still looking for Parze. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MCProsecutors.Office/photos/a.485130481569822/2593602537389262/?type=3&amp;theater">From the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office</a>:</p>
