      <p>More than 100 football players around the country received an “offer” to come play for the Florida Gulf Coast University’s football team. There’s just one small problem.</p>
      <p>The university, which has 15 Division I sports teams, doesn’t actually have an intercollegiate football team — only a club team. However, someone associated with the club sent out what looked like official offers from an NCAA team and even had several recruits posting on social media about the program.</p>
      <p>In a statement released from the school this week, it is made clear that no one involved with the university had any idea these unofficial offers were being made.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we have been notified that a non-employee, volunteer with the football sport club has extended ‘offers’ to come to FGCU and play football to more than 100 individuals across the country,” the statement said. “This has been done without FGCU’s knowledge or sanction, and has caused a great deal of confusion to not only the individuals receiving the ‘offers,’ but to others reading accounts on social media.”</p>
      <p>FGCU hasn’t expressed any plans to add an NCAA football team in the future. But Kevin VanDuster, who is the football club team coach, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28125185/fgcu-football-program-says-nationwide-offers-play-sent-club-team">told ESPN Wednesday</a> that while it recruits for the club team, he is always clear about what they’re joining when speaking to potential players.</p>
      <p>“We are not in the NCAA and we are not affiliated with the FGCU athletic department,” a text message from VanDuster to a recruit shown to ESPN reads. “Since we are not in the NCAA, we do not have GPA rules or credit requirements. Our players must be enrolled in a minimum of 3 credits (one class) and pay the on campus participation fee, and they are eligible to play for us. … As a club team, we do not have any scholarships for players. You would have to pay for your schooling and housing, etc.”</p>
      <p>VanDuster, who said he recruits high school players from as far away as Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas, said he would ensure that it was clear the player was joining a club team and wasn’t guaranteed admission into the university. He also made sure to tell them that the school didn’t award football scholarships.</p>
      <p>The second-year head coach also told potential prospects that they could post on social media that they’d been offered a spot on FGCU’s club football team roster.</p>
      <p>“However, please do not post anything false, such as you have been offered a full scholarship or any scholarship please,” VanDuser wrote. “Or that you have a D1 offer. We are a club team [and] not D1.”</p>
      <p>ESPN reported that VanDuster said that he and other university coaches met with school officials earlier in the week, where they had to turn over their cell phones to allow their messages and social media to be investigated.</p>
