      <p>Star Wars is one of the most iconic movie franchises of all times...this cannot be argued (seriously, don't even try). And if you recently got Disney+ and are obsessed with the George Lucas universe, you're likely watching the new show The Mandalorian, which stars the most beloved character in the whole dang galaxy: Baby Yoda. (Again, this cannot be argued.) He's so stinkin' cute that everythingeven an ugly Christmas sweaterbecomes cute by proximity.</p>
      <p>Don't believe me? Peep this adorable find from Etsy that you can snag for just $38. Whether you're going to an actual ugly Christmas sweater party, or just want to fan out over Baby Yoda, this sweater was made for Mandalorian fans.</p>
      <p>Coming in both navy and forest green, the sweater features the phrase "What Child Is This?" on it, an ode to the classic Christmas carol and the new hit series. (Real Yoda talk: More perfect could this sweater be?)</p>
      <p>The design "mimics the look of thread," making this sweatshirt "perfect for fans of force wielding toddlers and bounty hunters in need of some Life Day cheer." Plus, because it's a pre-shrunk, classic fit sweatshirt that's made with air-jet spun yarn, this sweater is super soft and made for reduced pilling.</p>
      <p>These sweatshirts are made to order, so take into account three to eight business days for processing. Shipping in the US takes between six and sixteen days, too. (FYI: If you're looking to send it to an international fan, you can totally do that too, but shipping will take around 21 days.)</p>
      <p>Basically, this is the Christmas sweater that needs to be on every Star Wars fan's holiday gift list.</p>
