      <p>This fall at designer studded celebrations in both New York and Toronto, Benjamin Moore, one of the design world’s go-to brands for trendsetting colours, revealed its 2020 Colour of the Year. The shade, First Light, a soft, airy pink that flatters any space, offers a refreshing alternative to the traditional neutral mainstays of white, beige and grey.</p>
      <p>“This blush pink is a really fresh colour and certainly a leap off of the whites that we have been seeing,” says designer Stephanie Smith,  principal and co-founder at Calgary’s Smith Erickson Design.</p>
      <p>“It has a modern Scandinavian edge, but could also be used in more traditional applications,” she says.</p>
      <p>Marking a new decade, the colour re-examines the concept of home, while exploring how it will continue to evolve over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>“We selected First Light as our Colour of the Year 2020 to represent a new dawn of idealism, design and living,” says Andrea Magno, Benjamin Moore’s director of colour marketing and development.</p>
      <p>She goes on to explain that the colour reflects a new definition of the home, one with a focus on fulfilling internal desires rather than external ones. “It’s a shift in mindset from the material to the core needs in life – community, comfort, security, self-expression, authenticity and ultimately, optimism,” she says.</p>
      <p>In addition to the reveal of First Light, the paint company also unveiled its 2020 Colour Trends Palette, designed as a collection of harmonious hues to pair with First Light. The 10 shade collection ranges from subtle white to hues of saturated blue, green and straw, with many of the shades offering a vintage, heritage feeling.</p>
      <p>Magno says the collection plays an integral role in shining a light on a new era of values, family dynamics and design.</p>
      <p>“Colour is powerful and highly subjective, especially through the lens of different generations, relationships and moods,” says Magno.</p>
      <p>Smith definitely would agree. “Colour creates emotions,” she says.</p>
      <p>As a general rule of thumb deeper, more saturated  tones create more drama, while lighter shades evoke softer, more soothing feelings.</p>
      <p>Although Erickson says that Calgarians can be a little gun shy when it comes to colour — they love their beige and light greys — they are becoming more adventurous.</p>
      <p>“Fresh Light is a little more daring — there’s lots of colour tone to it, but it still makes a great neutral. It could be used as a main wall colour, paired with white, greys and metallics or in accents or as a piece of furniture,” she says.</p>
      <p>For the trepidatious, the Calgary designer suggests introducing colour slowly and in small doses. She intimates that the 2020 colour palette by Benjamin Moore is a good place to start. “There is an elegance to these shades; they have a grey undertone, so they are not in your face, but they are definitely colourful.”</p>
      <p>She suggests trying a swatch (the 2020 colour collection comes in individual pint samples) on a wall or two and watching it in all lights to see if it still reads well from day to night and that you still resonate with it, as paint hue changes with the light. Paint colour can also vary from wall to wall within the same room.</p>
      <p>“There really is no right or wrong with colour. Just have fun with it and surround yourself with the shades that make you feel happy,” she says.</p>
