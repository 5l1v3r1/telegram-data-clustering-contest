      <p>Staff Pick</p>
      <p>This controller is expensive, there is no denying that, but the Astro c40 TR is pretty amazing too. With the number of customizable parts on this controller, the c40 TR can be just about anything you want it to be. This flexibility is a massive boon considering how much personal preference comes into play on controller layouts. PlayStation opted for a symmetrical design on the DualShock for aesthetics, but most find asymmetrical to be more ergonomic. The c40 TR lets the player choose.</p>

      <p>One of the best parts of playing PlayStation games is being able to play with friends online. For many PS4 games, that means having a PlayStation Plus subscription. This service not only gets your PS4 owner access to playing with friends online but also exclusive sales and discounts. As well as giving them two free games every month as part of the subscription, the price of which usually amounts to more than what you paid for the whole year's subscription.</p>

      <p>Astro's entry-level wired headset is one of its most compelling options, especially when you weigh the quality you get for the price. Made from "damage resistant polycarbonate," the A10's can take a beating that would sideline most headsets. You may not be getting much in the way of fancy features, but you do get a reliable, well-made, and great-sounding headset with in-line volume control and omnidirectional mic featuring flip-up muting.</p>

      <p>When in doubt, a gift card is always something a gamer will enjoy. Especially with the option of digital games becoming so popular, it's challenging to know which titles somebody already owns. With a PlayStation Store gift card, they can buy a new game, DLC or some in-game items they've been eyeing which you might not know about. They could even hold onto the gift in their PlayStation wallet until a sale to get several games at once!</p>

      <h3>Give with confidence</h3>
      <p>With a few items to get you started shopping for the PlayStation gamer in your life, any of these will likely put a smile on their face. But a pro-gaming controller like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASTRO-Gaming-C40-TR-Controller-PlayStation/dp/B07KF1FB1F/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU57698YYw">Astro c40 TR's</a> might make it a sheer grin. It is so customizable that it can fit anybody's preference for layout and comfort, and it is something not everybody would splurge to buy themselves. However, that price tag doesn't make it a gift everybody can give, and there is no shame in that.</p>
      <p>You will never go wrong with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Store-Gift-Card-Digital/dp/B004RMK4P8?th=1&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU57698YYw">PlayStation Store gift card</a>, it can be any game your gamer wants and who can say no to that. With values ranging from $10 to $100, it can fit any budget, and they don't expire. If that title they were hoping hasn't released just yet, it can be saved in their PlayStation wallet for when they want to use it.</p>
      <p>But, no matter what you decide to get for your gamer, the fact that you are putting in an effort to understand their hobby. Helping them find something they'll enjoy is what means the most.</p>
