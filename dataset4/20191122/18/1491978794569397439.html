        <i>President of the European Central Bank says US/China tariff war should be seen as an opportunity</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/06/easy-money-wont-solve-christine-lagardes-economic-problems">Christine Lagarde</a> has called for European governments to boost innovation and growth with higher rates of public investment, in her first major speech as president of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2019/html/ecb.sp191122~0c1f115db0.en.html">Speaking to an audience of bankers in Frankfurt</a>, Lagarde said that rising trade barriers triggered by the US/China tariff war should be grasped by European governments as an opportunity to build a stronger internal market.</p>
      <p>“More dynamic internal growth offers a way to improve the functioning of the euro area and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/the-guardian-view-on-eurozone-populism-fight-it-with-fiscal-firepower">to accelerate crisis recovery</a>,” she said, adding that “there is a case for investment in a common future that is more productive, more digital and greener”.</p>
      <p>Lagarde, who also called on governments to deepen the single market for services, banking and capital markets, said Europe must create <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/30/christine-lagarde-europ-economy-ecb">a healthier internal market</a> to accelerate private sector investment.</p>
      <p>“Public investment in the euro area remains some way below its pre-crisis levels. The share of productive expenditure in total primary expenditure – which in addition to infrastructure includes R&amp;D and education – has also dropped in nearly all euro area economies since the crisis,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We face a global environment that is marked by uncertainty. But I believe that, if we approach this challenge in the right way, it can also be a moment of opportunity.”</p>
