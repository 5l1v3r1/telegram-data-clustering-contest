      <p>The Welshman was pictured posing and laughing in front of a flag which read "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" after Wales had <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/hungary/euro-2020/result/result-aaron-ramsey-fires-wales-to-euro-2020-with-victory-over-hungary_379926.html">beaten Hungary</a> to reach consecutive European Championships for the first time in the nation's history.</p>
      <p>Reports have claimed that this picture, which quickly went viral, has angered those within the Madrid hierarchy, who described the flag as a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/news/madrid-unhappy-with-bales-bad-joke_380026.html">"bad joke".</a></p>
      <p>However, <i>ESPN</i> sources have been told by Barnett that Bale harboured no concerns over what reception he will get when the winger features for Madrid against Real Sociedad this weekend.</p>

      <p>Despite the incident, sources at the Bernabeu <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/transfer-talk/news/real-madrid-rule-out-january-exit-for-gareth-bale_380079.html">have insisted</a> that Bale was not up for sale over the January transfer window.</p>
