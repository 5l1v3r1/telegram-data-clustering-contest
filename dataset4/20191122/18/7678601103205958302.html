      <p>State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Minister Erick Thohir has confirmed that former Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama will be appointed as the new president commissioner of state-owned energy holding company Pertamina.</p>
      <p>“<i>Insya Allah</i> [God willing], [President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo] has decided that <i>Pak </i>Basuki will be the new Pertamina president commissioner,” Erick told the press at the Presidential Palace on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said Ahok would be accompanied by deputy minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, who would be appointed as vice president commissioner in the company.</p>
      <p>In addition, the businessman-turned-bureaucrat will also appoint current cellular provider firm Telkomsel president director Emma Sri Martini as the new Pertamina finance director, replacing Pahala N. Mansury, who was named president director of state-owned lender Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN).</p>
      <p>The ministry will also appoint former Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) deputy chairman Chandra Hamzah as BTN president commissioner to replace Asmawi Syam.</p>
      <p>Erick said Pahala’s and Chandra’s appointments would be made official after BTN’s extraordinary general shareholders meeting on Nov. 27, while Ahok and Emma would assume their new posts immediately.</p>
      <p>“Since Pertamina is not a publicly listed company, the appointment can take place today or on Monday,” he said.</p>
