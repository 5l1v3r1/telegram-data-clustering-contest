      <p>Former national security adviser John Bolton accused the White House of failing to give him access to his personal Twitter account after he left his position.</p>
      <p>Bolton, who left his position in September, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/glad-to-be-back-bolton-teases-return-to-twitter">tweeted for the first time</a> since his removal on Friday. In the three tweets posted on Friday, Bolton teased that he will be divulging more information in the near future, likely about the president and his time serving in the Trump administration.</p>

      <p>He tweeted, "Re: speaking up -- since resigning as National Security Advisor, the <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse">@WhiteHouse</a> refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I’m sorry to disappoint!"</p>
      <p>The president was asked if he had anything to do with the White House allegedly blocking Bolton's access to his own social media account during Trump's Friday morning interview on <i>Fox &amp; Friends.</i></p>
      <p>“No, of course not,” Trump said. “I had a good relationship with John.”</p>
      <p>At the time of Bolton's departure, Trump claimed he fired Bolton, while Bolton said he resigned.</p>
      <p>Bolton is seen as a potentially vital witness during the House impeachment investigation and has been asked to testify in front of House committees. His name has been <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bolton-considering-participating-in-closed-door-impeachment-testimony">brought up in testimony</a></u> from other witnesses, including Trump's former Russia adviser Fiona Hill.</p>
