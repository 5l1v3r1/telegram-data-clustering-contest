        <b>Lawyers make closing arguments in a Port Alberni case about the Indigenous cultural practice</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just how much of an effect an Indigenous smudging ceremony had on children in a Grade 5 classroom in Port Alberni was at the centre of closing arguments on Thursday in a civil trial against the school district.</p>
      <p>Candice Servatius, an evangelical Christian, filed a petition against School District 70, claiming her daughter’s right to religious freedom was infringed upon when the girl participated in a Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations smudging ceremony at John Howitt Elementary in 2015. She is seeking a ban on the cultural practice in schools across the province.</p>

        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Servatius’ lawyer, Jay Cameron with the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, argued the children were forced to participate in the smudging ceremony, and that it was not a demonstration, but an actual performance of the ritual.</p>
      <p>“I think that this is an exceedingly important point because if the experience is not entered into on a voluntary basis, it changes the experience,” said Cameron.</p>
      <p>“Certainly from [the daughter’s] perspective, there was confusion. There was a loss of trust.”</p>
      <p>Smudging is a common Indigenous spiritual practice in which herbs such as sage, sweetgrass and cedar are burned for ‘cleansing’ purposes.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, teacher Jelena Dyer told the court the Nuu-chah-nulth elder had come to the classroom, explained the ceremony and her people’s beliefs to the kids, and burned a bit of sage.</p>
      <p>The court heard conflicting testimony about the amount of smoke in the room, from “heavy” to “barely any.”</p>

        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Cameron also referred to a letter that had been sent home before the ceremony, without a date or a clear way for parents to opt their children out of it.</p>
      <p>The school district’s lawyer, Keith Mitchell, dismissed the letter, saying the case is about what happened in the classroom.</p>
      <p>He argued Servatius and her daughter are not reliable witnesses, because Servatius is only relying what her daughter told her, and her daughter does not remember the events accurately.</p>
      <p>“Children are very much concerned whether their parents are upset, or whether the authority figures of their lives, particularly their parents or pastor, tell them something is wrong and that they should have felt a certain way,” he said.</p>
      <p>He referred to earlier testimony from teachers, such as Dyer, who’d told the court the girl appeared “happy” to watch the ceremony, sitting in the front row, and had not expressed any concerns. The instructor also said it was made clear that there was no intent to “impress” beliefs on anyone.</p>
      <p>Finally, Mitchell argued the family’s religious beliefs were not significantly affected by the ritual or how they practice their own faith, so the ceremony should still be allowed.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t change the way the Servatius family lives their lives.”</p>
      <p>The trial is expected to conclude on Friday.</p>
