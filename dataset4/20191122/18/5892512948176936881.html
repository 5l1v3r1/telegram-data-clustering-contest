      <h1>Israel Adesanya just suffered back-to-back Twitter losses to Yoel Romero and Jon Jones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:55:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya, opened fire on 185-pound rival, Yoel Romero, with a Hollywood meme designed to poke fun at “Soldier of God,” who is <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20962120/ufc-dana-white-respects-israel-adesanya-desire-face-yoel-romero-will-work-booking-title-fight-mma">likely to get the next crack</a> at “The Last Stylebender’s” crown.</p>
      <p>Have a look.</p>

      <p>Then Romero (or whoever runs his Twitter account) fired back:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Judging by the fan reactions, Romero won that round 10-8.</p>
      <p>Undaunted, Adesanya went after light heavyweight champion, Jon Jones, following <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/15/18311649/ufc-israel-adesanya-slams-irrelevant-jon-jones-im-everything-he-wished-he-was-mma">months of back-and-forth trash talk</a> that nearly convinced the promotion to pair them off for a champion vs. champion “super fight” ... <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/29/20938610/ufc-dana-white-israel-adesanya-wont-face-injured-paulo-costa-too-soon-jon-jones-super-fight-mma">until Dana White thought otherwise</a>.</p>
      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2016/5/16/11686090/chael-sonnen-explains-why-fans-cant-get-behind-drunken-coke-addict-version-jon-jones-mma">another coke joke</a>:</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/stylebender/status/1197693750446702592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p>Jones came back with logic:</p>
      <p>“Be sure to tell your kids how I made my first million at age 23, let them know I accomplish records you never came close to,” Jones wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBones">Twitter</a>. “Let them know you had the chance to fight me but you didn’t want to get Mayweather’d and decided to make an excuse. Bro I’m done replying to you.”</p>
      <p>“You’re gaining some popularity, I’ve seen so many popular fighters come and go over these years,” Jones added. “Statistically we’re nowhere on the same level, I’m going to start treating you that way. You get no more responses out of me until 2021, I’ll be interested to hear your excuse then.”</p>
      <p>Jones is expected to make his next 205-pound title defense against Dominick Reyes in Houston, while Adesanya currently remains unbooked.</p>
      <p>And I’m just going to leave this fan retort right here:</p>
