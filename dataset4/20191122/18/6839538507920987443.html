      <p>The one man who might have been able to help William and Harry fix their relationship has left the palace, leaving the brothers to grapple with unresolved issues.</p>
      <p>Making it harder to achieve peace has been the decision of the Queen’s longstanding private secretary Christopher Geidt to leave his post.</p>

      <p>Sir Geidt, who served in the role for ten years, was often known to smooth over any grievances between the brothers and the rest of the British royal family, <i>The Daily Mail </i>reports.</p>
      <p>“Petty grievances can become huge conflicts between all the different royal offices if they aren’t managed correctly, and that’s exactly what’s happening now,” an unnamed friend told <i>People</i>.</p>
      <p>The friend said Sir Geidt was a valuable pair of ears for the royal brothers when difficulties arose, often able to provide a different voice to that offered by their father Prince Charles.</p>

      <p>During a candid ITV interview in October, the Duke of Sussex acknowledged tensions between himself and William, following months of speculation about the state of the brothers’ relationship.</p>
      <p>Palace insiders had denied there was a rift between the Sussexes and the Cambridges, who had once been dubbed the Royal family’s very own “Fab Four”.</p>
      <p>When asked to comment on the speculation in the documentary<i> Harry and Meghan: An African Journey</i>, Harry hinted at the difficulties in his relationship with William.</p>
      <p>“Part of this role, part of this job and this family being under the pressure it is under, inevitably stuff happens.</p>
      <p>“But look, we are brothers, we will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment.</p>
      <p>“But I will always be there for him and, as I know, he will always be there for me.</p>
      <p>“We don’t see as much as we used to, because we are so busy, but I love him dearly and the majority of stuff is created out of nothing. As brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.”</p>

      <p>Palace watchers say it’s inevitable the brothers are becoming more distant as they move in very different directions in life.</p>
      <p>Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell previously said that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are on a “different trajectory” to Harry and Meghan.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <i>Good Morning Britain</i> last month, Mr Burrell said Prince William was heading “to the boardroom” and Prince Harry “to the factory floor”.</p>

      <p>Giving a revealing insight into the royal dynamic, Burrell said: ‘William and Kate are on a different trajectory – they’re headed to the boardroom, it’s already mapped out,” Mr Burrell said.</p>
      <p>“Whereas Harry and Meghan are headed for the factory floor – they’re there to help ‘the people’.”</p>
