      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit: Justin Fields’ Future At Ohio State Is “Frightening”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:41:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Justin Fields’ first season at Ohio State has been one of the best in school history, and one of the best in college football this year. But ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit thinks he’s just getting started.</p>
      <p>In a recent analysis of Fields, Herbstreit said that his future is actually “frightening” to think about.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit explained that the combination of hype, talent, coaching and more weapons next year could lead to him playing on another level in 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/ohio-state-football/kirk-herbstreit-calls-justin-fields-future-frightening/">Saturday Tradition</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s about where I thought he would be — but I think his future is frightening,” Herbstreit said. “When a guy comes in with that kind of hype, I guess your expectations are so high. Then when you think about Ryan Day and what Ryan Day can do with a quarterback, I think we’ve just seen the beginning of who he is. He’s potentially a Heisman candidate and yet I still think he’s growing immensely.<br/><br/>”When we watch him next year — providing they still have great skill and great backs and a great line, because that’s really helped him — I think he potentially could go to a whole other level we’re not even familiar with, because of his ability to run and throw.”</blockquote>
      <p>Fields joined Ohio State in a transfer from Georgia at the start of the year. He quickly earned the starting job and has dominated the Big Ten all year.</p>
      <p>To date, Fields has 2,164 passing yards for 31 touchdowns and only one interception. But he’s a threat on the ground too with 377 yards, 4.5 yards per carry and another 10 rushing touchdowns.</p>
      <p>And if production like that is Fields only scratching the surface, it bodes very well for his future.</p>
      <p>Will Justin Fields win a Heisman Trophy at Ohio State?</p>
