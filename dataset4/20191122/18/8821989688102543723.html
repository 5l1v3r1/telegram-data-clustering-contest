      <h1>How the ‘More Cowbell’ Sketch ‘Ruined’ Christopher Walken’s Life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:40:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Corey Irwin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/will-ferrell/">Will Ferrell</a> and the <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/saturday-night-live/">Saturday Night Live</a></i> team created meme-worthy moment with the "<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/snl-more-cowbell/">More Cowbell</a>" sketch on April 8, 2000. They also, apparently, “ruined” the life of actor <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/christopher-walken/">Christopher Walken</a>.</p>
      <p>Known for films like <i>Biloxi Blues</i> and <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, Walken famously appeared with Ferrell in the skit, and their chemistry was a key part in making the scene so iconic. Ferrell, dressed in ‘70s rocker garb, emphatically played along to the tune of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/blue-oyster-cult/">Blue Oyster Cult</a>’s “Don’t Fear the Reaper,” as Walken – in the role of music producer Bruce Dickinson – uttered the legendary phrase: “I’ve got a fever. And the only prescription is more cowbell.”</p>

      <p>Ferrell was reminded of that moment while talking to <i>Tonight Show</i> host <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/jimmy-fallon/">Jimmy Fallon</a>, a former <i>SNL</i> castmate who <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jimmy-fallon-recalls-famous-blue-oyster-cult-more-cowbell-saturday-night-live-skit/">also appeared in the sketch.</a></p>
      <p>“Here’s the crazy thing. I go to see Christopher Walken years later, in a play. I say hello to him backstage and he’s like, ‘You know, you’ve ruined my life,'" Ferrell said, impersonating Walken’s distinctive voice: “‘People during curtain call bring cowbells. The other day I went for Italian food for lunch, and the waiter asked if I wanted more cowbell with my pasta bolognese.'"</p>
      <p>He added that Walken had a good sense of humor about his place in <i>SNL</i> history, noting that the actor “had a little smile” while discussing the segment's lasting legacy. “From <i>The Deer Hunter</i> to <i>Pulp Fiction</i> to ‘More Cowbell,'" Ferrell joked. "That’s all he gets.”</p>
      <p>Ferrell is set to host <i>SNL</i> for the fifth time this weekend. Check out his <i>Tonight Show</i> interview below.

      <h3>Blue Oyster Cult Albums Ranked</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>14. 'Club Ninja' (1985)</h4>
      <p>By 1985, original keyboardist Allan Lanier was gone. The band tried to reclaim its earlier glory, bringing back producer Sandy Pearlman, who oversaw those early classics. "Dancin' in the Ruins" attempted to get that poppy hard-rock sound that shot "Burning for You" on the charts, but it didn't quite get the job done.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>13. 'Heaven Forbid' (1998)</h4>
      <p>The band's first album after a 10-year break found a return to a somewhat heavier sound. The core of Eric Bloom, Buck Dharma and Allan Lanier tried to forge ahead, but 'Heaven Forbid' doesn't really sound like a true Blue Oyster Cult album. They sound more like a generic bar band here than the trailblazers they once were. One lone highlight: "Harvest Moon," which recalls some of the flash of their early glory.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>12. 'The Revolution by Night' (1983)</h4>
      <p>Change was in the air in 1983. For starters, funding member and drummer Albert Bouchard was shown the door. Arriving two years after the success of 'Fire of Unknown Origin,' 'The Revolution by Night' was a step sideways rather than forward. Solid rockers like "Take Me Away" and "Feel the Thunder" are classic Blue Oyster Cult, but duds like "Shooting Shark," drowned in cheesy '80s production, helped to sink this ship.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>11. 'Curse of the Hidden Mirror' (2001)</h4>
      <p>By 2001, only the most loyal fans were taking notice of the band's albums. How many people actually heard 'Curse of the Hidden Mirror' is debatable -- which is a shame since it's the most consistent and genuine sounding B.O.C. album in years. "Dance on Stilts," "Here Comes That Feeling Again" and "The Old Gods Return" show a strong, if not full-on, return.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2017/02/imaginos.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>10. 'Imaginos' (1988)</h4>
      <p>'Imaginos' started as a solo project for drummer Albert Bouchard, but was shelved after he was ousted in 1981. The band revisited the recordings a few years later, adding elements for a concept album mired in science-fiction themes, courtesy of lyricist and producer Sandy Pearlman. Musically, it's a return of sorts to the band's classic harder-edged style. Despite some dated production, it holds up better than you might think. Aldo Nova, Joe Satriani, and the Doors' Robbie Krieger all lend a hand.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>9. 'Cultosaurus Erectus' (1980)</h4>
      <p>With 'Mirrors' still fresh in the rear-view, Blue Oyster Cult rebounded quickly with 1980's 'Cultosaurus Erectus,' which tried to recapture the band's darker side. Producer Martin Birch, known for his work with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, gave the band back some of the sharp edges on tracks like "The Marshall Plan" and "Black Blade." Fans dug it, pushing sales to gold.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>8. 'Mirrors' (1979)</h4>
      <p>By 1979, Blue Oyster Cult were at a crossroads. The pop-music landscape was changing, and they were trying to figure how they fit into it. Changing course, the band brought in producer Tom Werman, at the time enjoying success producing hard-rock acts like Ted Nugent, Molly Hatchet and Cheap Trick. He applied a pop shine to those harder-edged sounds, and 'Mirrors' ended up being a total mismatch. The band failed to hold its identity through most of the album, though songs like "In Thee" and the title track were enjoyable hard pop songs. They just weren't Blue Oyster Cult songs.</p>

      <h4>7. 'St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings by Stalk Forest Group' (1970/2001)</h4>
      <p>A Blue Oyster Cult album in all but name ... Stalk Forest Group were an early incarnation of the band that recorded an entire LP for Elektra Records in 1970. A single was released to radio, but the recordings were shelved until 2001. These are the first tracks by a band that would change its name within a year and sign to Columbia. The roots of that sound are right here, with a bit more of psychedelia tossed in.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>6. 'Spectres' (1977)</h4>
      <p>Though seen as a commercial disappointment following 'Agents of Fortune,' 'Spectres' still managed to sell more than half a million copies and giving the world the classic ode to giant monster "Godzilla." The band became a bit more polished on 'Spectres' but without shunning their identity. "I Love the Night" remains one of their most haunting songs, while the less-celebrated "Goin' Through the Motions" may be their most pop-tastic moment.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>5. 'Fire of Unknown Origin' (1981)</h4>
      <p>The band found it difficult to immediately repeat the success of 'Agents of Fortune.' It took another five years before they had another hit with "Burnin' for You" from 1981's LP 'Fire of Unknown Origin'. "Joan Crawford" and "Veteran of the Psychic Wars" are a couple more killers from the band's best- charting album. And "Burnin' for You" topped Billboard's rock radio charts.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>4. 'Agents of Fortune' (1976)</h4>
      <p>The band's commercial breakthrough was a winner on all counts. They maintained their distinct style while managing to break into the Top 40 with the classic "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" -- a great song that has since turned into a punchline thanks to SNL's famous "cowbell" skit. It deserves better. The song's Byrdsian jangle is married to some wild distortion for pure B.O.C. And "This Ain't The Summer of Love" anticipates punk, while "The Revenge of Vera Gemini" features spoken word and lyrics by keyboardist Allen Lanier's girlfriend Patti Smith.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>3. 'Tyranny and Mutation' (1973)</h4>
      <p>Blue Oyster Cult's second album pulls no punches as is storms full speed ahead out of the gate with "The Red &amp; the Black, a revamped version of "I'm on the Lamb but I Ain't No Sheep" from their debut, this time amphetamine- fueled and raving. They come on like heirs to the throne vacated by the MC5, but with a tad less bravado and a bit more cerebral context in the mix. "O.D.'d on Life Itself," "Hot Rails to Hell," and "7 Screaming Diz-Busters" are all great -- and that's just Side One.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2. 'Blue Öyster Cult' (1972)</h4>
      <p>This debut album remains a rock 'n' roll marvel. Somehow mixing a hard-rock foundation with elements of the Byrds, the band is near its peak here. From the gorgeous "The Last Days of May" to the eerie "She's as Beautiful as a Foot" to the ragged hard-rock stomp of "Cities on Flame With Rock and Roll," BOC's debut is as perfectly formed as nearly any debut album.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>1. 'Secret Treaties' (1974)</h4>
      <p>Blue Oyster Cult's first two albums set the stage for their masterpiece, 1974's 'Secret Treaties.' The LP combines everything great about those first two LPs and distills them into one spotless batch of songs. Slightly more refined than that first pair, but with the power and drama front and center, the album shows off everything there is to love about the band. The sexy swagger of "Career of Evil," the storming rock 'n' roll of "ME 262" and the shimmering "Astronomy" are just the tip of the greatness found here.</p>
