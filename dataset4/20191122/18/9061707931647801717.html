      <h1>Family of paramedic Tammy Minshall want to create place where daughter can remember her mum</h1>
      <h2>She died after the ambulance she was in was involved in a horror crash with a BMW</h2>

      <p>A memorial dedicated to tragic paramedic Tammy Minshall who died in a crash will serve as a place her loved ones can sit and remember her.</p>
      <p>Funny and loving "party girl" Tammy, was just 31 when the ambulance she was travelling in was involved in an accident with a BMW at the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">Anslow Road junction with Belmont Road</a>.</p>
      <p>She died on Wednesday, July 3, leaving behind her nine-year-old daughter, Eva.</p>
      <p>Now her family and friends are aiming to raise money to install a memorial bench so they have somewhere to sit and remember her for them and anyone else who knew Tammy.</p>
      <p>They need to raise £2,000 to install the bench which will have a unique design. It will act as a permanent memorial.</p>
      <p>The design for the metal bench is still in the early stages. However, it will include images of the air ambulance, a paramedic dealing with a patient and a bike and a plaque so anyone can sit and remember the student paramedic.</p>

      <p>Her mother <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/stretton">Lynn Minshall, from Stretton</a>, said: "It will mean a lot to us. We can go an sit there with Eva and it would just be lovely in memory of Tammy.</p>
      <p>"It hasn't been decided where it will go yet but we have thought about Jubilee Park, in Hillfield Lane. Tammy used to go disco dancing there many years ago.</p>
      <p>"We did go to enquire about it going in the grave yard but we have to go through the Lichfield Diocese and we are waiting for them to get back to me."</p>
      <p>Now a fund-raising page has been set up to raise the money needed to make the bench.</p>
      <p>The page states: "We're raising £2,000 to erect a memorial bench for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">Burton trainee paramedic </a>Tammy Minshall, who tragically died on duty while serving her community.</p>
      <p>"Tammy Minshall was a Burton mum and trainee paramedic. She was just 31 when she tragically died while on duty serving her local community.</p>
      <p>"She leaves behind a daughter, Eva aged nine. The community want to leave a memorial in grateful thanks for Tammy's life and service.</p>
      <p>"We hope the bench will be a lasting memory, and a place where Eva and Tammy's family can sit to remember this remarkable young woman."</p>

      <p>Tammy was on duty when she died in the horror crash at the junction, which is is well known for being the scene of accidents, with nearby residents saying there is at least one serious accident a year and many more minor ones.</p>
      <p>She was a first-year <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/education">Staffordshire University student</a> paramedic who had been on placement with West Midlands Ambulance Service at the Lichfield ambulance hub since May.</p>
