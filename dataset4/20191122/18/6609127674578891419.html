      <p>The<a href="http://bit.ly/35pymT3"> incident</a> took place at the A749 Kingsway on October 18, 2017.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old, of Chapelton, South Lanarkshire, also denies accelerating and failing to brake for an amber light at the crossing and then failing to stop for the red light, where he hit Megan.</p>
      <p>Constable Helen Howie told the court that she and a colleague received a call to a <a href="http://bit.ly/35pymT3">road traffic collision at the Kingsway</a> and when they got there realised it was a very serious incident.</p>
      <p>She said: “I made my way to the crowd of people. There was a pedestrian lying on the carriageway – it was a female. I wanted to find the driver.”</p>
      <p>The police officer said that Kennedy approached her and said: “I was the driver.”</p>
      <p>She added: “He said he had struck the female, but he hadn't been speeding.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Chris McKenna said: “Did you look at his vehicle,” and she replied: “There was damage to the vehicle and the windscreen was damaged.”</p>
      <p>Constable Howie said when she spoke to Kennedy he was 'really upset' and added: “He kept asking if he had killed her. He was upset.”</p>
      <p>The court was told that Kennedy took a roadside breath test which was negative.</p>
      <p>Defence QC John Scullion said: “Kieran Kennedy approached you at the scene and told you he had been driving the car and had struck the female who was injured,” and constable Howie replied: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>The QC then asked: “Did he tell you he hadn't seen the female,” and she said: “I can't recall that.”</p>
      <p>However, she agreed that she had written this in her operational notes which was written up at the time.</p>
      <p>Mr Scullion said: “How would you describe Mr Kennedy's condition at the time,” and the witness said: “He was distraught, shaking and crying.”</p>
      <p>The jury was told that Kennedy, who was not physically injured, was checked both by paramedics and at hospital.</p>
      <p>Constable Howie said: “I thought he was suffering from shock.”</p>
      <p>The trial before judge Lord Armstrong continues.</p>
