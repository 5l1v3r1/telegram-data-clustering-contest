      <p>A reckless driver who killed a dad after losing control of his BMW at 100mph has fled the country to avoid justice.</p>
      <p>Adrian Wojciechowski, 29, had been "bullying" another motorist moments before he crashed head-on into David Grant-Jones, who was returning home from his son's graduation.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to 11 years in prison for causing the death of Mr Grant-Jones, but is thought to have fled to his native Poland.</p>
      <p>A court heard he had been driving 'literally on the bumper' of a Mercedes car in front before braking too late when a dual carriageway merged.</p>
      <p>Wojciechowski's trial for causing death by dangerous driving had to be held in his absence as he is believed to have fled the country after being released on police bail earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He is thought to have left the country via the Channel Tunnel and travelled east via France and Germany.</p>
      <p>Police say they are continuing their enquiries to locate him and bring him back to Britain under a European Arrest Warrant to serve his sentence.</p>

      <p>A court heard Mr Grant-Jones, an oil rig tool manager from Weymouth, Dorset, and his wife Heather had attended their son's graduation at Portsmouth University on July 14, 2018.</p>
      <p>Mr Grant-Jones was killed instantly in the crash on the the A35 near Bere Regis, Dorset.</p>
      <p>Mrs Grant-Jones suffered broken ribs and foot and still needs crutches today.</p>
      <p>In a heart-breaking victim impact statement, Mrs Grant-Jones said: "Our son's graduation had been one of the proudest days of our lives but my husband was then cruelly snatched away.</p>
      <p>"It's almost impossible to comprehend that never again will he walk through the door.</p>
      <p>"He was a brilliant dad. I know how lucky I was to have him in my life. He was a hard-working and wonderful man.</p>
      <p>"He worked away every three weeks and I used to get so excited when I heard his car pull up. Knowing this will never happen again is unbearable.</p>

      <p>"We had 28 wonderful years together. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye.</p>
      <p>"I often think about what we could have done differently that day, we could have left a little later or taken a different route, but the reality is that if it hadn't been us it would have been someone else.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that the heartbreak we feel will be prevented from happening to anyone else ever again."</p>
      <p>The court heard Wojciechowski's white BMW 335d reached speeds of over 100mph on the A35.</p>
      <p>Witnesses during the trial described his driving as 'bullying' and 'aggressive'.</p>
      <p>Eye-witness Anne Marie Wood, who had been travelling with her 11-year-old daughter, said his BMW had 'literally been on the bumper' of the car in front.</p>
      <p>The court heard that an examination of the Mercedes car had paint scrapes and speckle marks on it which indicated Wojciechowski had collided with it.</p>

      <p>He was arrested on August 7, 2018. During his police interview, he answered 'no comment' to all questions.</p>
      <p>He was issued with a postal requisition to first appear at Weymouth Magistrates' Court on February 25, 2019.</p>
      <p>Wojciechowski, of West Moseley, Surrey, was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Bournemouth Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He was also banned from the roads for 10 years, with the disqualification due to start when he has served his jail time.</p>
      <p>Judge Stephen Climie called his actions 'arrogant', with a 'blatant disregard for the safety of others'.</p>
      <p>He said: "The death of David Grant-Jones, a loved and loving husband, father, brother and uncle, was unnecessary and wholly preventable."</p>
      <p>Sergeant Fern Graham, of the Dorset Police traffic unit, said: "The reckless driving of Adrian Wojciechowski has resulted in fatal consequences with a devastating impact on the family of Mr Grant-Jones.</p>
      <p>"Nothing will make up for the loss of their loved one and I can only hope that the conviction at court today will in some way help them to move forward.</p>
      <p>"We will continue to make enquiries to locate Wojciechowski so he can be apprehended and face justice for his actions. We believe he is not in the country."</p>
      <p>A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: "We can confirm that Adrian Wojciechowski was convicted and sentenced in his absence and that Thomas Russell will be tried at a future date for an offence of dangerous driving."</p>
      <p>The Mercedes driver, Thomas Russell, 39, had been jointly charged with causing death by dangerous driving, three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and a count of causing death by careless driving.</p>
      <p>But jurors were instructed to find him not guilty of these charges after the CPS dropped its allegation that both defendants had been 'racing' before the crash.</p>
      <p>Mr Russell, of Ferndown, Dorset, will be tried for dangerous driving at a later date.</p>
