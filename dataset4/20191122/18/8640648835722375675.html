      <p>AT&amp;T is bringing 5G coverage to Las Vegas by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>The company’s 5G network will be available for Las Vegas customers with 5G compatible devices ahead of its nation-wide launch in 2020, according to a Friday statement from the company.</p>
      <p>The 5G service will first launch in Providence, Rhode Island; Rochester, New York; Indianapolis; San Diego; and Pittsburgh in the coming weeks. The company plans to bring 5G to more markets — including Las Vegas, San Jose, and San Francisco — following the initial launch, bringing 5G service to “tens of millions of customers and businesses.”</p>
      <p>The company initially introduced 5G to select areas in the U.S. last year including Las Vegas with a “business-first and experience-based strategy,” according to the release. Only customers using the Galaxy S10 5G phone on the AT&amp;T Business Unlimited Preferred plan were able to use the network.</p>
      <p>“We’re now introducing consumers to the future of wireless with broad 5G service included in our best unlimited plans for 5G devices,” said Thaddeus Arroyo, CEO of AT&amp;T Consumer in the release.</p>
      <p>The company plans to continue to expand its 5G offerings and make it available nationwide in the first half of 2020.</p>
