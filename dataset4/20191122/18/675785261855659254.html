      <h2>Xhaka was stripped of the Gunners' captaincy after his outburst towards the club's fans in the draw with Crystal Palace, and his future at Arsenal remains uncertain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:53:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hector-bellerin">Hector Bellerin</a> has called for unity from his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> teammates in the aftermath of the Granit Xhaka row which has split the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Tensions at the Emirates have been running high since <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/granit-xhaka">Xhaka's</a> outburst at Gunners fans, which ultimately saw him stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Xhaka now looks likely to leave Arsenal in the near future as his relationship with the supporters is in tatters.</p>
      <p>The row has caused friction between factions of the Arsenal squad, but Bellerin is hopeful they can put their troubles behind them and move forward as a team.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10401169/arsenal-bellerin-dressing-room-split-xhaka/">the Sun</a> , Bellerin said: "It's been hard as a player in the dressing room to deal with these situations.</p>

      <p>"I think it's important as a club, as everything being divided is never the way forward.</p>
      <p>"I think the [right] way is accepting who we are, what we have, getting everyone together, supporting each other, and that is the way that we can reach our goals."</p>
      <p>Arsenal's problems have stemmed from poor results on the field which have contributed to a toxic atmosphere at the Emirates.</p>

      <p>Xhaka told supporters to "f*** off" after he was booed while being substituted in the draw with Palace.</p>
      <p>Bellerin tweeted the following day: "We are all humans, we all have emotions, and sometimes it's not easy dealing with them. It's time to lift each other up, not to push each other away. We only win when we are together. #COYG."</p>
      <p>In his discussion with the Sun, Bellerin added: "That was my call for unity in terms of us as a club, as a family, everything that Arsenal is.</p>
      <p>"To get together when things don't go well, that is the time for us to tap each other on the back and be like 'come on, we need to do this better but we're going to come back on top'."</p>
      <p>Arsenal have a chance to get their league form back on track at the weekend with a home clash against relegation strugglers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , though Xhaka is not expected to be involved.</p>
