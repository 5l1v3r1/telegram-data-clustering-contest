      <p>South Africa, who were crushed 3-0 by hosts Egypt in the semi-finals came with an attacking line-up in pursuit to qualify for next yearâ€™s Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless the South Africans pulled out all the guns right from kick-off and were rewarded when Luther Singh saw his shot from a tight angle deflected home 16 minutes gone.</p>
      <p>The young Ghanaians struggled to come back and Teboho Mokoena nearly upped the South Africans tally a minute later but the SuperSport United man flashed wide from a whisker.</p>
      <p>Singh caused all sorts of havoc around the area and after pushing high up the pitch on 24 minutes, managed to get a shot on goal which Kwame Baah beat to a corner kick instead.</p>
      <p>Ghana reshaped their stall across the final entry of the pitch straight after the resumption, as Issah Abass entered for Yaw Yeboah. The move paid off within five minutes as Evans Mensah rifled home an outrageous strike to draw the sides level.</p>
      <p>Momentum remained strongly with the Ghanaians thereafter, but the South Africans recovered and reclaimed advantage 12 minutes later with a well taken strike from second-half substitute Kamohelo Mahlatsi, who scored just moments after coming on.</p>
      <p>The South Africans were made to pay for their inability to finish off the contest five minutes from time as Samuel Gyabaa opened space to convert past Mpoto from close range in the area to send the game to penalties.</p>
      <p>The match was settled in a drama-filled penalty shoot-out which saw South Africa reign victorious to qualify for successive Olympic games with Lyle Foster netting the winning kick.</p>
