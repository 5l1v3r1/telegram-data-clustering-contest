      <p>What warrants a "closet staple"? We asked 27 stylish women to detail their wardrobe workhorses and their feedback was varied. One source is a self-proclaimed "striped tee-aholic," an astrologist told us which Gucci item speaks to her Capricorn rising, Aries sun, and there's a black blazer one CEO claims gives her "businesswomen special" vibes. Click through to see how they define their style essentials, with more from chefs, PR directors, and our very own editors, ahead.</p>

      <p>"I’m a striped tee-aholic. (Is that a thing?) I own more versions of a sailor t-shirt than I want to admit, but this is because it’s my ultimate go-to! For casual looks…striped tee and jeans. For “fancier” events…striped tee and dress pants or a skirt. And of course, add jewels to mix it up!"<i>–</i> Maria Dueñas Jacobs, Founder, Super Smalls </p>

      <p>"I love an item where the more you wear it, the better they get. A loafer can elevate you without a heel and pull your outfit together, no matter the season. Getting colder? Add a sock and change the whole look. These loafers from Bass are a classic and my go-to."— Emilie Fife, Fashion Partnerships, Instagram </p>

      <p>"A trench coat is not exactly fashion news, but something about this one feels just right. It's oversized so you can layer it with sweaters and other jackets, and has an extra-long length that feels cool. Olive lapels differentiates it from more boring trenches out there. I'm reaching for this trench to tone down some of my crazier pieces, and to add polish to weekend wear."—<i> </i>Chloe King, Fashion Office &amp; Digital Lead, Bergdorf Goodman</p>

I love the double wrap one I got from Proenza Schouler a few seasons ago, but this one from Givenchy is currently on my wish list.

      <p>"My love affair with high-waisted denim started in New York—thank you, Jenna Lyons—and has only gathered steam in the last three years since I moved to LA. While I have many pairs of beloved vintage Levi’s, I feel polished and pulled together in a pair of Khaite Vanessa Jeans. I love them so much I have them in three washes—black, ivory, and a classic blue. They’re slim with the slightest touch of stretch. The black lacquer button is just the cherry on top. A straight leg jean, fancy blouse, and pointy flat is my forever uniform no matter what coast I’m on."— Nandita Khanna, Editorial Director, Feals </p>

      <p>"I love nightgowns (my business card used to say nightgown enthusiast). Most of mine are vintage white cotton with some bit of lace or ribbon from France and Italy. I buy them from vintage shops, Beacon's Closet, stoop sales, and one was a gift from Bordeaux. I wear them with pointy black shoes and when they begin to disintegrate, I stop wearing them to work and start wearing them at home and to the beach. My best friend just picked one out for me at Loretta Caponi in Florence. It’s white with a print of blue flower garlands and nosegays with little bows.

In the Fall, I love how the ruffle neck and sleeve peep out when layered under a knit.

      <p>"When I get dressed in the morning, I like to imagine myself walking into the diner in<i> Romy &amp; Michelle's High School Reunion </i>and asking for the "businesswoman special." I basically dress for my thirteen-year-old self. It's a lot of pastels, tweed, heels and as many hair accessories as I can make office-appropriate. My favorite pieces recently have been from the brand Alessandra Rich. I'm particularly obsessed with this blazer and wear it over dresses and skirts practically daily.  Black offers a palate cleanser to whatever else I'm wearing, and the fit is super flattering. I love the square neck - it's such a cool touch. I think I need to invest in the pink version as a Christmas gift to myself."— Nell Diamond, Founder and CEO, Hill House Home </p>
