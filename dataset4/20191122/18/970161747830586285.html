      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has opened up about being a father to her children Kylie and Kendall Jenner – although fans are convinced that she accidentally let slip that Kylie was pregnant again.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/11/caitlyn-jenner-liberated-after-gender-reassignment-surgery-and-admits-she-was-tired-of-tucking-it-in-all-the-time-6566938/">who had gender reassignment surgery in 2017</a> discussed with her fellow campmates about being a parent, when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> candidly asked her what her children called her.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn responded: ‘My kids all call me dad, Kendall asked me first and I said “dad”, I’m your dad and I’ll always be your dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>‘But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.’</p>
      <p>Kate asked if Caitlyn felt like their father, she continued: ‘Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.’</p>

      <p>And on how many grandchildren she had, she added:  ‘Coming up this December I will have 20, and they call me Boom Boom’.</p>

      <p>And while we didn’t think anything of it at the time, many eagle-eyed viewers seemed to think that the numbers just didn’t add up – with many convinced this meant that Kylie Jenner could be pregnant again.</p>
      <p>And they took to social media to share their conspiracies about it.</p>
