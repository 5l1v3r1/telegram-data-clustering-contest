      <p><b>Kolkata</b>: Triggering controversy actor-turned Trinamul Congress MP of Basirhat,  Nusrat Jahan has claimed that the previous MP of the Lok Sabha constituency in North 24 Parganas was hardly visible during his term.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, her predecessor at Basirhat was Idris Ali, also from chief minister Mamata Banerjee's party, from 2014 to 2019.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She also credited herself with visiting her constituency more than him. Her comparison is bound to cause an embarrassment to the Trinamul. Jahan informed that she has many welfare plans for the people there. On Friday she met the superintendent of police (Basirhat Police District) Kankar Prosad Barui at his office.</p>
      <p>The Trinamul MP later told the media, "After becoming an MP I visited Basirhat many times. If you do a comparison, the previous MP perhaps was not seen here so much. The people of Basirhat would say that they did not find him. But they have seen me. In future you will get to see what kind of planning and projects I have for the benefit of the people. Please do not spread rumours."</p>
      <p>Asked if she would visit the Cyclone Bulbul-hit areas in her constituency if she gets a scope Jahan elaborated, "It is not about scope. It is about will. If there is a will, there is away. It is not that I will go if I get a scope. I will go wherever and whenever needed."</p>
      <p>She added, "When the chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is above of all of us supervised the disaster management herself, and also visited the areas, there is no need for us to look into it. She is thinking for the people. My efforts rather will be to do my job and get a bill passed in New Delhi for my constituency so that I can bring something here for the people."</p>
      <p>On her recent illness the Trinamul MP noted, "Rumours keep doing the rounds on the artists always about their health. There is so much pollution around. I have a history of asthma which had caused the respiratory distress. Since the pump was not at hand, a problem had cropped up. But I visited my constituency soon after my recovery thanks to prayers and love by my family, relatives, fans and press."</p>
