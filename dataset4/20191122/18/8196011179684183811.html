      <p>Westlife have landed their first UK number one album in more than a decade.</p>

      <p>The four-piece fended off competition from Celine Dion as well as duo Michael Ball and Alfie Boe, whose new releases charted at number two and three respectively.</p>
      <p>Westlife told OfficialCharts.com: “Thank you so much to everyone in the UK who’s made Spectrum number one this week.</p>
      <p>“We can’t believe that after 21 years we’ve got another number one – our eighth number one album.</p>
      <p>“The reunion has been going so well, thank you for everything.”</p>
      <p>Spectrum shifted 63,000 chart sales this week across physical, download and streaming formats, the Official Charts Company said.</p>
      <p>The group, comprised of Kian Egan, Nicky Byrne, Shane Filan and Mark Feehily, last had a chart-topper with Back Home in 2007.</p>

      <p>Spectrum is the band’s 11th studio album, and their first since 2010 record Gravity, which peaked at number three in the UK charts.</p>
      <p>Children’s album Kidz Bop 2020, part of a series featuring children singing pop songs, placed at number seven in the albums chart.</p>
      <p>Miller, 11, who appeared on the album, told the PA news agency: “I can’t believe we have a top 10 album.</p>
      <p>“It’s my first Kidz Bop album release, and I am so excited – it’s a dream come true to share this moment with the other Kidz Bop Kids!”</p>
      <p>President of Kidz Bop Vic Zaraya said: “Kidz Bop has resonated with kids and families across the UK.</p>
      <p>“Achieving a third top 10 album in just over two years is great momentum as the British Kidz Bop kids prepare for their first headlining tour across the country next April.”</p>
      <p>On the singles chart, Australian singer Tones And I claimed an eighth week at number one with Dance Monkey.</p>
