      <p>“While I will continue to canvass for sustained resource allocation for the Nigerian Navy, I wish to pledge the unalloyed commitment of the officers and ratings of the Service to a safe, secure and stable maritime environment for the prosperity of the nation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also speaking, the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, a retired major general, congratulated the newly promoted senior officers for attaining the enviable rank.</p>
