      <h1>Harry Styles' 'Fine Line' Track Features His Ex-Girlfriend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:35:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nylon.com/author/allison-stubblebine" target="_blank">Allison Stubblebine</a></address>
      <h3>WHO IS IT?!</h3>
      <p>In a new interview for New Music Daily with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats released on Friday, Harry Styles laid it all out on the table, from new yet-to-be released songs off his new album <i><a href="https://nylon.com/harry-styles-fine-line-album">Fine Line</a> </i>to his romantic life. In talking with Lowe, Styles revealed that his ex-girlfriend is featured on "Cherry", a song about heartbreak that made it to the record.</p>

      <p>Styles describes a night in the studio, a few weeks into recording <i>Fine Line, </i>during which "Cherry" came to fruition. It was around 2 a.m., and nearly everyone had left. "I was saying that I was feeling a lot of pressure, because the last record wasn't a radio record. I felt a lot of pressure to be making these big songs," Styles says, describing the albums he wanted to make in five, 10 years. He continues: "And Tyler just said to me, 'You just have to make the record that you want to make right now. That's it. There's no let me make sure this one is a commercial success, so that I can make what I want later down the road. You just have to make the record that you want to make right now,'" which led them to writing "Cherry".</p>
      <p>Lowe brings up a "vocal at the end that cuts in" to "Cherry", and asks Styles who it belongs to. "That was my ex-girlfriend," Styles says, adding, "I think it was because it got added in later on, and it felt so part of the song. It just felt like it needed it. We're friends and stuff, so I asked her if it was okay. And she was okay with it. I think she liked it." What Styles doesn't<i> </i>say is <i>which </i>ex-girlfriend. This is the stuff that will keep Styles stans up at night until it <a href="https://nylon.com/harry-styles-fine-line-album">finally drops on December 13</a>.</p>
      <p>But that doesn't mean we can't brew up a few theories before the album comes out. Back when Styles <a href="https://nylon.com/harry-styles-fine-line-album">first announced</a> basic details about <i>Fine Line,</i> fans were quick to notice that the release date coincides with Taylor Swift's birthday. The two pop stars reportedly <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/harry-styles-talks-taylor-swift-relationship-new-interview-2054222">dated between 2012 and 2013</a>, which <i>could </i>make the coincidental release date not so coincidental after all, especially if it's Swift's voice that winds up cutting into the end of "Cherry". Swift's <i>1989 </i>track "Out Of The Woods" is rumored to be about her relationship with Styles, but this has never been confirmed.</p>
