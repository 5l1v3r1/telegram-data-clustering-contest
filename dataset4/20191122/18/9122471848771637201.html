      <h1>A Current Notre Dame Player Will Be On The Call For Saturday’s Game vs. Boston College</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>We’ve seen networks experiment with alternate broadcasts for events like the College Football Playoff and NCAA Tournament. Now, NBC is doing the same thing for Saturday’s Notre Dame home finale against Boston College.</p>
      <p>The network has announced the “Notre Dame Fan Feed,” which will be broadcast on NBC Sports Network. The normal game broadcast, with Mike Tirico, Doug Flutie, Chris Simms, and Kathryn Tappen, <a href="https://thespun.com/independents/notre-dame-fighting-irish/notre-dame-vs-boston-college-game-time-spread-channel-announcers">will be on NBC as usual</a>.</p>
      <p>While Tirico and Flutie are always professional, NBC’s broadcast has a bit of a Notre Dame bent. The alternate feed will go all-in on Notre Dame fandom.</p>
      <p>Ahmed Fareed is set to serve as host, with former ND running back Darius Walker, alumna Jessica Smetana of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, and reporter Tony Simeone on the call. Also involved is a current Notre Dame player: injured defensive lineman Daelin Hayes.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen active pro players call games before—Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen’s occasional foray into the booth comes to mind—but this might be the first instance of a player calling his own team’s game that I can remember.</p>

      <p>Hayes suffered a torn labrum earlier this year, and is out for the season. Fortunately, the senior’s injury was in the fourth game of the season, and he will retain a year of eligibility, and plans to return to Notre Dame next fall.</p>
      <p>I’ll be interested to see what ND fans who try out this new broadcast think, though I expect most will stick with Tirico and company on the main network.</p>
