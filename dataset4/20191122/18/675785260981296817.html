      <p>A domestic abuse victim pretended to order a pizza so the perpetrator wouldn't know she was calling for 911 for help.</p>
      <p>The woman, who has not been named, has been praised for her quick-thinking by police after they were called to her address in Oregon city, Ohio, USA.</p>
      <p>Officers arrived at the home and arrested the man over reports that he had assaulted the woman's mother, <a href="https://www.13abc.com/content/news/Local-victims-daughter-calls-911-to-order-a-pizza-to-signal-domestic-violence-565190342.html">reports ABC 13</a> .</p>
      <p>Similar instances of ordering pizza to alert police about domestic violence have been widely shared on social media in the past.</p>
      <p>However, such tactics are considered rare and are not generally advocated by law enforcement agencies.</p>
      <p>The operator who answered the call, Tim Teneyck, says he initially thought the person had rang the wrong number, but the woman's real intentions quickly became apparent.</p>

      <p>Mr Teneyck was able to respond accordingly after reading about other instances on social media where it has happened.</p>
      <p>"You see it on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , but it's not something that anybody has ever been trained for," Mr Teneyck said.</p>
      <p>"Other dispatchers that I've talked to would not have picked up on this. They've told me they wouldn't have picked up on this."</p>
      <p>The transcript of the call shows how the woman was able to communicate her the nature of her emergency without directly discussing it.</p>

      <p>It reads:</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b>  Oregon 911</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b>  I would like to order a pizza at [address redacted].</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b>  You called 911 to order a pizza?</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b>  Uh, yeah. Apartment [redacted].</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b>  This is the wrong number to call for a pizza...</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b>  No, no, no. You're not understanding.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b>  I'm getting you now.</p>
      <p>Later in the call, the woman found creative ways to answer Mr Teneyck's yes or no questions about how much danger she and her mother were in, and what services they needed.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b>  Is the other guy still there?</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b>  Yep, I need a large pizza.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck: </b> All right. How about medical, do you need medical?</p>
      <p><b>Caller: </b> No. With pepperoni.</p>

      <p>The exact origin of the pizza emergency call is unclear but it did make an appearance on Reddit in 2014 when a user described a similar incident.</p>
      <p>They wrote that the call "started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious"</p>
      <p>Last year, Christopher Carver who is operations director for National Emergency Number Association in the US, debunked claims that operators were trained to deal with calls of this nature.</p>
      <p>"Setting any expectations of secret phrases that will work with any 911 centre is potentially very dangerous," he said, and recommended that people use 911's SMS service instead.</p>
      <p>Victims of domestic violence in the UK have been advised to use the "silent solution system" used by British cops.</p>
      <p>Callers to 999 should remain silent if they are able to speak and can then dial 55 to inform the person on the other end that they are in a genuine emergency.</p>
      <p>If this option is not available, callers can leave the phone off the hook so that operators can hear what is going on.</p>
      <p>Police should be able to trace the address of the call and respond accordingly.</p>
