      <p>Maritzburg United’s Gabriel Nyoni is confident that his side will dig deep in making sure that they are no pushovers against the high-firing Kaizer Chiefs.</p>
      <p>The Team of Choice and Amakhosi will lock horns on Sunday afternoon in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout competition and despite the unpredictability in cup fixtures, it seems that Chiefs are the favourites to head into the final. </p>

      <p>However, speaking in an exclusive feature with Soccer Laduma this week, Maritzburg’s striker, Nyoni is confident in how his head coach, Eric Tinkler will set-up to try and stop Amakhosi. </p>
      <p>“Stopping Chiefs will take some doing, not only for Maritzburg United but for all the teams because if Khama Billiat is not performing, they have Nurkovic doing well. If Lebogang Manyama is not performing, they have Dumisani Zuma firing on all cylinders, so it’s really difficult, but doable,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They play as a compact unit, which is why they are winning so many games. The team spirit is very high in their team. When they attack, they put in more bodies in your box. But all we can do is follow the instructions of our coach, who has studied them. He will definitely come up with a plan to stop them,” Nyoni added. </p>
