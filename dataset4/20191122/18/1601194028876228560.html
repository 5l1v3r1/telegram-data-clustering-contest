      <p>In the aftermath of this week's Wednesday Night Wars, WWE NXT finally managed to beat AEW Dynamite in TV ratings for the very first time since the two shows have been going head-to-head.</p>
      <p>Current NXT Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/adam-cole">Adam Cole</a> has now joined the likes of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cody-rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> and current AEW Champion Chris Jericho in reacting to the major news of NXT finally beating AEW in the Wednesday Night Wars.</p>
      <h3>Adam Cole's take on NXT beating AEW for the first time in ratings</h3>
      <p>In the aftermath of NXT finally beating AEW Dynamite in terms of TV ratings for the first time in the Wednesday Night Wars, current NXT Champion Cole sat down for an interview with <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/wwe-nxt-beats-aew-dynamite-viewers-ratings-usa-network-tnt/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">The Wrap</a> and during the conversation, he was asked about the Black &amp; Gold brand's victory over Dynamite.</p>
      <p>Cole responded by stating that he isn't too bothered about the ratings but is certainly happy with his brand's win and also added the fact that he had a blast working with the RAW and SmackDown Live stars who made their way over to NXT this week. (H/T: SEScoops)</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re just mainly focused on trying to put on a really exciting, cool show. And last night’s show was just an absolute blast, with the guys from ‘RAW,’ the guys from ‘SmackDown,’ the matches that happened, it was just a really, really cool night and so I’m glad so many people enjoyed it."</blockquote>
      <h3>What's next for Adam Cole?</h3>
      <p>Adam Cole has a tough task ahead of him, as he will have to defend the NXT Championship at Survivor Series against either Pete Dunne, Killian Dain, or Damian Priest. However, at NXT TakeOver: WarGames, Cole will be leading The Undisputed Era into battle against Team Ciampa.</p>
