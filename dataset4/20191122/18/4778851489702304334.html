      <p>There is also talk the new chief will look to keep Aberdeen at Pittodrie and scrap plans to build a new stadium out in Kingsford.</p>
      <p>Milne has reportedly decided to step aside after 21 years in order to focus on other business projects.</p>
      <p>Cormack has already invested heavily in the north east club and secured the investment which saw the construction of a new training ground - named Cormack Park.</p>
      <p>There is expected to be a shake up on the board after Cormack takes charge.</p>
