      <p>The Russian billionaire took over the club in 2003 and ushered in a spell of immediate success under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, it had been suggested that Abramovich was looking to put the West London club up for sale amid a continued visa row with the UK government.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Telegraph</i>, the 53-year-old has taken Chelsea off the market after receiving no serious bids over the past 18 months.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Abramovich is encouraged by the progress made under Lampard, whose team sits <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">third in the Premier League</a> table after 12 games.</p>
      <p>The former midfielder faces his biggest task on Saturday when Chelsea travel to the Etihad to face Manchester City.</p>
