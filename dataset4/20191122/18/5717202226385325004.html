      <h1>Report: Wolves tracking Ligue 1 full-back Brandon Soppy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:15:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have been credited with an interest in Rennes full-back Brandon Soppy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Transferts-monaco-le-rb-leipzig-et-wolverhampton-foncent-sur-brandon-soppy-rennes/1082432">L’Equipe report</a> the 17-year-old has emerged as a possible target for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, with Champions League outfits AS Monaco and RB Leipzig also showing interest.</p>
      <p>Soppy, a French U18 international, signed his first professional contract with Rennes last year, but is yet to make his first-team debut for the club with Hamari Traore currently ahead of him in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>Youngster Sacha Boey is also competing for minutes at right-back.</p>

      <p>L’Equipe say one of the interested teams is ready to put forth an offer of €8 million/£7 million.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether Rennes would be willing to let the talented youngster go given his potential.</p>
      <p>Over the years the Rennes academy has produced some great players such as Sylvain Wiltord, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Ousmane Dembele and very exciting new kid on the block Eduardo Camavinga.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Soppy would be a big gamble</h3>
      <p>Given Soppy is yet to have a taste of Ligue 1, Wolves would certainly be making a bold move pursuing a transfer.</p>

      <p>He impressed at the U17 World Cup, helping France finish third at the tournament in Brazil, but the Premier League would be a big step up for the starlet.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Espirito Santo likes what he sees though, and to be fair the manager only really as Matt Doherty to play at right wing-back, with Adama Traore more effective in the final third these days.</p>
      <p>Realistically if signed he would spend some time with the youth teams first.</p>
