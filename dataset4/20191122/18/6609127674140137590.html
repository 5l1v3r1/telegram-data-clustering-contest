      <p>Milne joined the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Pittodrie</a> board in 1994 and became chairman four years later.</p>
      <p>With the club’s move to a new £13 million training facility on the outskirts of the city now complete, he has successfully overseen the first phase of the transformation of Aberdeen FC.</p>
      <p>And with a new stadium adjacent to Cormack Park unlikely to be opened before at least 2023, Milne has decided to hand over control after more than two decades at the helm.</p>
      <p>The Aberdonian housebuilder will be succeeded by US-based multi-millionaire Cormack, currently the club’s vice-chairman.</p>
      <p>Cormack was appointed second in command last December after returning the club in 2016 after a spell as chief executive at the start of the century,</p>
      <p>He sold his software company before investing in the Dons and has since brought American Tom Crotty on board with further finance.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old, who stays in Atlanta, has been seen as Milne’s successor since he returned.</p>
      <p>And after a long and sometimes turbulent reign, Milne will now hand over the keys to the boardroom.</p>
