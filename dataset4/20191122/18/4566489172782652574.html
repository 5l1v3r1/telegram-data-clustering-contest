      <h1>Calls to probe Russian official over stance on domestic abuse</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:50:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Relatives of Russian women who lost their lives to domestic violence are urging the government to probe a deputy minister for downplaying the scale of the problem, a rights group said Friday.</p>
      <p>In a letter to Justice Minister Alexander Konovalov, relatives of four victims said his deputy Mikhail Galperin was unfit to occupy his position.</p>
      <p>In the letter whose excerpts were released by Zona Prava, a non-governmental group, the relatives said they "are deeply outraged" by Galperin's position.</p>
      <p>Among them is the father of Yana Savchuk who was killed by her partner in 2016 after police ignored her pleas for help.</p>
      <p>In a case that shocked Russia at the time, a female police officer told Savchuk: "Don't worry, if you get killed, we'll come to register the body."</p>
      <p>Domestic violence is a major issue in Russia but efforts by activists to lobby for a separate law against violence have so far failed.</p>
      <p>Police do not normally intervene, even in severe cases.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in October, Deputy Justice Minister Galperin downplayed the gravity of the issue, saying "the problem of non-family violence is far more topical."</p>
      <p>Galperin also said existing legislation was enough to protect women, adding that men were in fact more vulnerable because they are "not generally expected to ask for protection."</p>
      <p>Galperin's statement to the ECHR came after four victims of domestic abuse including Margarita Gracheva turned to the Strasbourg-based court, complaining that Russian authorities could not protect them.</p>
      <p>Gracheva had her hands chopped off by her husband in 2017.</p>
      <p>President Vladimir Putin's spokesman on Friday said the problem of domestic violence existed in the country but it did not fall within the Kremlin's purview.</p>
      <p>"It is not on the presidential administration's agenda," Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</p>
      <p>He declined to say whether the Kremlin would support a probe into Galperin.</p>
      <p>In a report last year, Human Rights Watch said that Russian police dismiss victims of domestic violence and pointed to "significant gaps in Russian legislation" such as a lack of a separate criminal charge for "domestic violence", and a culture of victim blaming.</p>
      <p>The report detailed extreme assaults including women being choked, punched and burned by their attackers.</p>
