      <p><i>“There are far too many leaders in our society who are disconnected from the reality on ground and that does not augur well for people-centred policies and good governance,”</i> he lamented.</p>
      <p>He emphasised that Nigeria would experience great relief <i>“if we will heed the divine injunction to repent, seek God's face and turn from our wicked ways.”</i></p>
      <p>He commended Chairman of CAN in the state and members of the association’s executive for the programme, which rallied Christians of all denominations for fellowship and prayer.</p>
      <p>Chairman of CAN in the state, Senior Apostle Silvester Okorote, while welcoming guests and members earlier, had said,<i> “the state CAN Day remains an annual event which every Christian in Delta earnestly look forward to celebrating.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is a day when we gather from all churches and the five blocs across the state to celebrate the oneness of the body of Christ on which the high priestly prayer of Jesus Christ was cantered.”</i>
