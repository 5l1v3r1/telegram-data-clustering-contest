      <p>It is one of the biggest Christmas food purchases you will make and this year you might have to take out a second mortgage to pay for it. It is the festive ham, the centrepiece of many Christmas Day tables and it has never been more expensive.</p>
      <p>With African swine fever decimating pig populations in Europe and China, the price of pigs has skyrocketed. By Christmas, it is expected that ham prices will have increased 100 percent.</p>
      <p>When you are spending big money on a ham, you want to get it right. But how do you choose?</p>

      <p>These days there are rare breed hams, organic hams, mass-produced supermarket hams, hams on the bone and off the bone, hams heavily smoked and others barely smoked — and all at a variety of price points and expectations.</p>
      <p>The Weekend West has done all the hard work this year, testing and tasting a range of hams available in WA.</p>
      <p>The final result? Our Top 10 Hams for Christmas 2019.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking mass produced hams are more wet and salty than traditionally cured artisan hams. They are pumped full of a sugary, salty curing solution and given a rapid cure, aided by nitrites to preserve it and maintain its pink colour.</p>
      <p>Traditionally made hams take longer to make — months compared with mere days for a mass-produced ham.</p>
      <p>They are drier but still moist, less salty and have a more complex flavour, showcasing the taste of pork rather than the brine. But all this old school artistry comes at a price.</p>

      <p>So what’s right for you?</p>
      <p>With the help of Australian Pork Limited, we asked ham producers to submit their product for tasting by our four-person judging panel.</p>
      <p>We also reached out to the two major supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths. The retailers sent in two hams at different prices.</p>
      <p>Twenty hams were tasted and assessed to arrive at out Top 10 for this Christmas.</p>
      <p>The top three hams — from Mondo Butchers, Torre Butchers and The Boatshed Cottesloe — were head-and-shoulders above the rest. They were in a photo finish for podium places, with barely anything between them in terms of quality and taste.</p>

      <h3>1. Mondo Black Hog Berkshire Free Range, Preservative-free ham. $26.70/kg.</h3>
      <p>This ham had it all: lovely texture, clean flavours, good salt levels, a balanced brine and incredible silky white fat.</p>
      <p>The flavours are delightful — full, rich, clean and just salty enough without being overpowering. A deserved winner of our Top 10. Importantly, a ham of this quality will keep in the fridge a lot longer than a cheap ham, which typically deteriorate more quickly.</p>
      <h3>2. Linton Batt Black Label Berkshire Ham, The Boatshed Cottesloe. $39.95/kg.</h3>
      <p>Made by one of the characters and innovators of the WA pork industry, Linton Batt, who manages the entire ham-making process from the paddock to the finished product at his small country abbatoir and butcher shop.</p>
      <p>This extraordinary ham is made exclusively for The Boatshed Cottesloe and is luscious, delicate, a good traditional shape, wonderfully fatty and not over-processed or swimming in brine.</p>
      <h3>3. David Torre Traditional Ham On The Bone. $17.50/kg.</h3>
      <p>A stunning ham with terrific taste and nicely dry (ie. not dripping with salty, slimy brine that is the hallmark of a cheap ham). It was in many respects as good a ham as that of our winner from Mondo Butchers, so at $17.50/kg it represents value for money.</p>
      <p>Torre is one of the city’s finest butchers and their ham is testament to generations of refinement and testing of their cured and smoked meats.</p>
      <h3>4. P. Princi Nitrite-Free Ham. $30.99/kg</h3>
      <p>Joe Princi has been making award-winning hams for many years. His hams are consistently at the top of the pack in national ham and pork awards.</p>
      <p>His ham is one of the finest and carefully manufactured, leading to a well-balanced ham of distinction.</p>
      <h3>5. Eurostyle Bone-In Ham. Prices vary.</h3>
      <p>Eurostyle is a Bibra Lake small-good manufacturer producing hams that routinely score gold and silver prizes in national pork awards.</p>
      <p>Their hams are available at selected retailers, butchers and supermarkets.</p>
      <p>Their bone-in ham was a lesson in proper European traditional meat curing — a stunner with good mouthfeel, nicely dry but sweet and succulent.</p>
      <h3>6. P. Princi Free-Range Berkshire Ham. $23.99/kg</h3>
      <p>Another cracking ham from Joe Princi and his team. Well priced and made with precision.</p>
      <p>It has a sumptuous flavour profile, great sugar/salt balance and wonderful mouthfeel.</p>
      <h3>7. Coles Beechwood Smoked Half Leg Ham on the Bone. $11/kg.</h3>
      <p>A terrific ham at the price. It may be a supermarket brand but you would be proud to have this ham on your table.</p>
      <p>The half leg format means you still get a good looking bone-in ham for the table at about $50 all up. A stunner.</p>
      <h3>8. Woolworths Gold Triple Smoked Bone In Half Leg Ham. $13/kg.</h3>
      <p>Another superb ham from one of the nation’s largest supermarkets. As the name suggests, this is one smoky ham.</p>
      <p>Too much smoke can often leave a bitter, bushfire taste to the flesh, but Woolies have got the balance right. The flesh is moist without dripping brine and the flavours are clean.</p>
      <p>Again, the half leg format gives you all the showbiz you want for your Christmas table without breaking the bank.</p>
      <h3>9. Re &amp; Sons/ Scarfo Butchers Bone in Ham. $18.99 per kilo.</h3>
      <p>It is an old-fashioned butcher’s ham made in collaboration with Tony Scarfo at Scarfo’s Meating Place butchers in Myaree. (Re &amp; Sons produces hams in its own right, too). Their hams are made only with female legs — yes, it makes a huge difference to the taste — from free-range porkers. The product is gluten free.</p>
      <p>It is not too salty, not pumped with watery brine and cuts superbly. A ripper at a great price.</p>
      <h3>10. Mondo Doro Leg Ham on the Bone. Prices vary.</h3>
      <p>Another winner from a large WA manufacturer. This is an everyday, well-made ham.</p>
      <p>It is on the bone for the wow factor you want at Christmas.</p>
      <p>Prices vary depending on where you buy it from but it is a well-priced ham that has not sacrificed flavour or texture.</p>
