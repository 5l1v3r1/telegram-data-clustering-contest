      <p>A motor home stopped on the tracks has been hit by a commuter train and burst into flames near Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of major injuries following the fiery collision at around 5.30am at a rail crossing intersection in an industrial area of Santa Fe Springs.</p>
      <p>The crash caused major delays during rush hour.</p>

      <p>Passengers and crew on Metrolink’s OC Line 681 were safely evacuated.</p>
      <p>Passenger Ryan Hajek said he felt the train operator slam on the brakes as it approached the crossing.</p>
      <p>Mr Hajek told TV station KABC-TV: “The lights inside went dark, so we knew something went wrong, I knew we crushed into something. As we stopped, I saw all the debris of what looked like a car on the side of the tracks, and I knew then that we had hit something.”</p>
      <p>Four people on board complained of pain and were treated at the scene.</p>
      <p>Investigators will try to determine why the motor home was stopped on the tracks.</p>
      <p>Fire crews doused the flames, which gutted the motor home and charred a rail carriage on a freight train stopped on a parallel track.</p>

      <p>The freight train was unable to stop in time and ran over some of the crash debris, according to Lena Kent, spokeswoman for BNSF, which maintains tracks in the area.</p>
      <p>Police were looking for four people seen running from the tracks just prior to the impact, but it was not immediately known if they were coming from the motor home.</p>
      <p>The collision occurred at a crossing equipped with gates and flashing lights, Ms Kent said. It was not clear if the motor home tried to drive around the gates, she said.</p>
      <p>The Metrolink train with five passenger carriages was heading north from Orange County when the crash happened about 15 miles south-east of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Buses were ordered to take 120 evacuated passengers to Union Station in Los Angeles. Widespread delays were expected on Metrolink’s Orange County and 91/Perris Valley lines.</p>
