      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:42:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Morse, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Former world champion boxer <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/31/sport/boxing-mayweather-beats-nasukawa/index.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> says he is "coming out of retirement in 2020."</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old made the announcement on his Instagram account, and also said he is working with UFC boss Dana White to "bring the world another spectacular event."</p>
      <p>Mayweather, who was undefeated in his career with a record of 50-0, is considered one of boxing's all-time greats.</p>
      <p>He came out of retirement in 2017 for his last professional boxing fight against UFC star Conor McGregor.</p>
      <p>After beating McGregor, a UFC rematch in the octagon was suggested, although nothing concrete ever materialized.</p>

      <p>He was last seen in the ring in an exhibition boxing match against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.</p>
      <p>In a bout that last just 140 seconds, Mayweather earned a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/31/sport/boxing-mayweather-beats-nasukawa/index.html">reported</a> $9 million (Â£7m) for beating the Japanese fighter.</p>
      <p>In October, Philippines boxing legend Manny Pacquiao and Alibaba founder Jack Ma <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/27/sport/manny-pacquiao-jack-ma-floyd-mayweather-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">challenged</a> Mayweather to a fight.</p>
      <p>"Floyd Mayweather, if you want a real fight, fight me. If you want an exhibition, my guy, my friend, Jack Ma will take care of you," Pacquiao said.</p>
