      <h1>‘Let’s Be Happy For Shatta Wale’- John Dumelo</h1>

      <p>Actor and politician, John Dumelo has waded into the ongoing Shatta Wale Grammy Awards nomination brouhaha.</p>
      <p>The aspiring Member of Parliament for Ayawaso West Wuogon constituency tweeted and said whether Shatta Wale has directly or indirectly gained nomination or not, at least we should all be happy for him for his contribution on Beyonce’s song which has been nominated.</p>
      <p>He wrote: <b>Saying his name has entered Grammys doesn’t mean he meant he’s a nominee. Let’s all be happy for <a href="https://twitter.com/shattawalegh">@shattawalegh</a></b>“</p>
      <p>Social media has been buzzing after Shatta Wale himself expressed happiness that Beyonce’s Lion King: The Gift album has been selected for consideration in the 2020 Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>His happiness was borne out of the fact that if she wins, all the artistes featured on the album, including Shatta Wale are indirect winners too.</p>
      <p>Wale tweeted:<b> At long last my name has entered <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GRAMMYs?src=hashtag_click">#GRAMMYs</a> ,thanks to the Beehive team !!!! Patience is truly the key !!! Pah pah pah pah.</b></p>
      <p>In a different post, he wrote: ”<b>If Beyonce win ago celebrate ruff , haters go bore ruff.</b></p>
      <p>However, according blogger NYDJ who also doubles as a radio presenter at YFM, he personally sent an email to the organisers for clarification on the <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/shatta-wale-has-not-been-nominated-for-grammys-blogger-clarifies/">Shatta Wale Grammys brouhaha and reply was sent to him to that effect.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>“According to a mail received from the Grammy Awards, only Artists who have worked on over 51% playing time of the pop vocal album would be nominees.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Any featured artist with less than 51% would not be a nominee. That settles it. Shatta Wale is not a Grammy Nominee.”</b>
