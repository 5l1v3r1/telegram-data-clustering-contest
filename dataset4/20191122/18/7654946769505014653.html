      <p>When it comes to politics, these guys are dropping the ball!</p>
      <p>More than a quarter of men in the US would rather their favorite football team win the Super Bowl than their preferred candidate win the presidency, a new poll shows.</p>
      <p>In a phone survey of 712 adults, 28 percent of guys admitted to caring more about the big game than the next leader of the free world, according to a press release <a href="http://blogs.shu.edu/sportspoll/2019/11/22/28-of-men-would-rather-their-favorite-team-win-the-super-bowl-or-world-series-than-their-favorite-candidate-win-the-2020-presidential-election-only-11-of-women-feel-the-same/">from Seton Hall Sports Polls</a>.</p>
      <p>Women, by contrast, tackled the question with more of a world view — with only 11 percent saying they’d rather their team score a championship.</p>
      <p>“It shouldn’t be a surprise that that many men care more about the outcome of a baseball or a football season than the political future of the country — but it is alarming,” said Rick Gentile, director of Seton Hall Sports Polls.</p>
      <p>Overall, roughly 8 percent of all people punted, saying they don’t care either way.</p>
      <p>The poll, which was taken on landlines, also shows that the better educated people are, the more strongly they feel about election results.</p>
      <p>Among folks with no high school education, 31 percent said they’re more devoted to the pigskin than any particular politician.</p>
      <p>Pollsters also asked the subjects if they spent more time watching sports than impeachment hearings in the past week — and 28 percent said yes. By contrast, 21 percent said they spent more time viewing the hearings.</p>
