      <p>The Benue State Police Command on Friday confirmed the discovery of three corpses belonging to one family in their room situated in North-Bank area of Makurdi metropolis.</p>
      <p>The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Catherine Anene, a deputy superintendent of police, who confirmed the bizarre happening to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi, said investigations were ongoing to unravel the cause of death.</p>
      <p>The PPRO also disclosed that a little girl was found in the room where the dead bodies were discovered completely unhurt but too small to give useful information.</p>
      <p>She said the cause of death was still unknown but added that all dead bodies had no physical injuries to warrant an immediate determination of cause of death.</p>

      <p>Some of the neighbours described the deceased family members as “peaceful” and wondered what could have happened.</p>
