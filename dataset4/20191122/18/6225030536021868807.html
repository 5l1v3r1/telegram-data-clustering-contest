      <h1>Saturday's Best Bet: Midcourt can improve again in Native Diver</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:42:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jarrod Horak</a></address>
      <p>Saturdayâ€™s 8th race from Del Mar is the Grade 3 Native Diver Stakes for 3-year-olds and up traveling a mile and an eighth on the main track (Post Time - 7:05 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#2 MIDCOURT (7-2) has really gotten good since moving to the John Shirreffs barn this year. All of his wins were after layoffs, and we will see if he can run two alike or improve without nearly as much time between starts.</p>
      <p>#4 Roadster (5-2) might be ready to step forward in his second start after a layoff for Bob Baffert. Earlier this year, he scored at one mile off a layoff, and stretched out to a mile and an eighth and smartly ran down Game Winner in the Santa Anita Derby (G1). He is the only entrant with a win at this distance.</p>
      <p>#5 Extra Hope (6-1) stretches back out in his third start after a layoff for Flavien Prat/Richard Mandella. He figures to stalk the pace. Both of his wins were at Santa Anita over a route of ground, and his last victory was in the slop.</p>
      <p>#6 Two Thirty Five (3-1) was a neck behind <i>Midcourt </i>in the Comma to the Top Stakes last time. The 2-time local winner projects an outside stalking trip under Abel Cedillo, but I am not sure about him beyond 8.5 furlongs.</p>
      <p>#1 Leading Score (7-2) is also trained by Bob Baffert, and he will probably attempt a wire job from the rail. He is unproven beyond a mile.</p>
      <p>#3 Zestful scratched.</p>
