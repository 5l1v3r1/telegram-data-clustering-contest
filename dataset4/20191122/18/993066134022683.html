      <p>Styles spoke to Zane Lowe on the presenter’s Apple Music radio show.</p>
      <p>The singer said of his supposed sex symbol status: “So uncomfortable. Honestly, I’d say I try and think about it as little as possible, because it’s a very strange, dynamic thing.</p>
      <p>“It’s also like a weird thing to think of about yourself.</p>
      <p>“I guess the thing with like sex, in general, is like, it used to feel so much more taboo for me.</p>

      <p>“Even like when we were in the band, the thought of people thinking that I had sex was like, oh no, that’s crazy. What if they know?”</p>
      <p>Styles said he has become more relaxed about sexuality in his public life, although he finds tabloid treatment of performers’ personal lives painful.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think a lot of the time, when there’s tabloid stuff, for example, of people breaking up, I think people forget that there’s a person who’s also broken up with someone, which is sad. You get sad when you break up with someone.”</p>
      <p>The full interview with Styles can be heard on Apple Music.</p>
