      <p>Westlife have triumphantly achieved their eighth number one album in the UK with their comeback effort and eleventh studio album, Spectrum.</p>
      <p>The album, which is the Irish boyband’s first in nine years, has achieved a total of 63,000 chart sales across physical, download and streaming formats. It is also the band’s first album since they reunited in 2018, following their split in 2012.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you so much to everyone in the UK whose made Spectrum Number 1 this week!’ the band told <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/">OfficialCharts.com</a></p>
      <p>‘We can’t believe that after 21 years we’ve got another number one – our eighth number one album.</p>
      <p>‘The reunion has been going so well, thank you for everything.’</p>
      <p>Member Shane Filan added to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘What a result. We’re genuinely delighted with the way this album has gone.</p>

      <p>‘I think we’re all pinching ourselves that how well received the new music has been. We didn’t expect it and can’t thank our fans enough.’</p>
      <p>Spectrum is the group’s first UK number one album since their eighth studio album, Back Home, which was released in 2007.</p>
