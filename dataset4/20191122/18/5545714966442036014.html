      <p><i>For today's contest, we're giving away the voice-controlled </i>The 3% Challenge<i> and an Amazon Echo or Google Home to play it on!</i></p>
      <p>So, this one is a little bit different. And as someone who's a little bit different, that sort of resonates with me. Variety is the spice of life, after all. So let's get spicy.</p>
      <p><i>The 3% Challenge</i> is a prequel narrative game to Netflix's cult series <i>3%</i>. You can play it using smart speakers, which is some pretty next-level stuff. So, we're giving away some smart speakers so you can check out the game for yourself, and do other things like ask a speaker the capital of Montana. Because nobody cares about Montana.</p>

      <p>As I'm part of the 97%, it'd be totally inappropriate for me to give any sort of representation of The 3%. So read about it below, instead.</p>
      <blockquote>Doppio Games, a leader in conversational games, shows the incredible potential of voice-controlled entertainment with its latest game release, <i>The 3% Challenge</i>, based on the critically acclaimed Netflix Original Series, “3%.” This free-to-play, multiplayer game is a prequel to the show;s dystopian drama, launching today on Amazon Alexa and later this week on Google Assistant. <i>The 3% Challenge</i> was produced in partnership with Rio Games, actress Bianca Comparato's production company. Comparato, who plays the lead character, Michele, in Netflix's <i>3%</i> also lends her voice to the game. The narrative created for the game is focused on a prequel storyline, with players experiencing what happened 20 years before the first season of the show. Fans of the series can join the process where candidates are challenged and vetted, just like in the Netflix sci-fi thriller. <i>The 3% Challenge</i> offers a unique gameplay experience, relying only on voice-control, with several custom-made voice-based challenges that test players' skills created specifically for the game. The game's prequel storyline was written in collaboration with series writers including Pedro Aguilera and Cassio Koshikumo.</blockquote>
      <p>Yeah, this one is totally different. But that's cool.</p>
      <p>Since the game is free-to-play for your smart speaker, we want to make sure you actually have one to play it on! So we're giving away one <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXM5BPP/ref=twister_B07456BG8N?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Amazon Echo</a> speaker, and one <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Home-Smart-Speaker-Google-Assistant/54742302?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_RAO1lG0MDxyOUpTwUx0Mo38VUkn1rTUmIzLrUs0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_10915&amp;clickid=RAO1lG0MDxyOUpTwUx0Mo38VUkn1rTUmIzLrUs0">Google Home</a> to help you get into this off-the-wall experience. And also ask it inappropriate questions. Whatever you wanna do, I guess.</p>

The number of winners to be selected in a specific Contest will be posted on the applicable Contest site. The odds of being selected as a potential winner depend on the number of eligible entries received during the Entry Period. Potential winners will be contacted via email and will be asked to provide their full name, age and mailing address within a specified time period.

General Conditions:</b> In the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Contest is impaired in any way for any reason, including, but not limited to fraud, virus, or other technical problem, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either: (a) suspend the Contest to address the impairment and then resume the Contest in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules; or (b) award the prizes at random from among the eligible entries received up to the time of the impairment. The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. In case of a dispute as to the owner of an entry, entry will be deemed to have been submitted by the authorized account holder of the screen name from which the entry is made. The authorized account holder is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.<br/><br/><b>9.Release and Limitations of Liability:</b> By participating in the Contest, entrants agree to release and hold harmless the Contest Entities from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Contest or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (a) unauthorized human intervention in the Contest; (b) technical errors related to computers, servers, providers, or telephone or network lines; © printing errors; (d) lost, late, postage-due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail; (e) errors in the administration of the Contest or the processing of entries; or (f) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant’s participation in the Contest or receipt of any prize.

All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, entrant’s rights and obligations, or the rights and obligations of the Sponsors in connection with the Contest, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Virginia.<br/><br/><b>11.
