      <p>Former national security adviser John Bolton raised eyebrows with a cryptic tweet Friday morning when he hinted at a major potential bombshell after liberating his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>The tweet comes after testimony in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has pointed to Bolton as a potentially key figure in filling in the gaps of questions into Trump’s alleged pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his own political gain.</p>
      <p>“We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor,” Bolton’s account posted.</p>

      <p>A subsequent tweet said that since Bolton had resigned from his adviser post, the White House “refused to return access to my personal Twitter account.”</p>
      <p>“Out of fear of what I may say?” the tweet continued. “To those who speculated I went into hiding, I’m sorry to disappoint!”</p>

      <p>Bolton’s attorney did not immediately return Business Insider’s request for comment on the tweets.</p>
      <p>However, the tweet came after new details of Bolton’s relationship with Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/fiona-hill-testimony-details-stunning-meeting-john-bolton-stormed-out-2019-11">emerged in testimony from Fiona Hill</a>, a former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs on the National Security Council, who detailed an incident in which Bolton abruptly left a July 2019 meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry about the energy structures in Ukraine and the US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.</p>
      <p>The House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is centered on an anonymous whistleblower’s complaint that alleged Trump was seeking to abuse his office for political gain, focusing in on a July 25 phone call with Zelensky. The complaint alleged Trump was pushing for an investigation into a fellow 2020 hopeful, former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Hill said that “Ambassador Sondland blurted out: Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff for a meeting if these ‘investigations in the energy sector start,” an apparent reference to the investigations into <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ukraine-gas-company-burisma-holdings-joe-bidens-son-hunter-explained-2019-9">Burisma, where Biden’s son Hunter</a> served on the board from 2014 to early 2019.</p>
      <p>Bolton “immediately stiffened and ended the meeting,” and after she told him about Sondland repeating mention of the investigations to Ukrainian officials, he told her to “go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you’ve heard and what I’ve said.”</p>
      <p>Bolton’s Twitter promise of “more to come…” echoes a mysterious warning from Chuck Cooper, the attorney for the former adviser, who hinted at Bolton’s extensive involvement and knowledge in a letter to Congress earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Bolton “was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,”<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/john-bolton-biggest-threat-trump-impeachment-inquiry-2019-11">Cooper wrote in a letter reported November 8.</a> The attorney has also said Bolton and his deputy, Charles Kupperman, will not testify in the inquiry until approved by a federal judge’s ruling.</p>
      <p>Bolton could emerge as a key figure in proceedings against Trump, as Axios previously reported that current and former senior administration officials said Bolton is a thorough note-taker and people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/john-bolton-biggest-threat-trump-impeachment-inquiry-2019-11">close to the White House are terrified of what he might share</a>.</p>
