      <p>Imagine living in a property which has views of the beautiful, green rolling Derbyshire Dales from all angles.</p>
      <p>Well, look no further.</p>
      <p>This luxurious seven-bedroom farmhouse is on the property ladder now and offers over £2,250,000 are being accepted.</p>
      <p>Bryn Hall Farm, situated on a hilltop, may be well over the majority of our budgets, but at least we can dream.</p>
      <p>The property is at the heart of the Derbyshire Dales, between Bradbourne and Brassington.</p>
      <p>Where to start with this enormous house? Inside the property, built with local stone and brick, there are a whopping seven-bedrooms - imagine how many guests you could have to stay.</p>
      <p>It has 1.75 acres of gardens and is sat on 23 acres of land, meaning it could quite possibly be the biggest garden you've ever seen.</p>
      <p>Each bedroom has an en suite, but that's just a fraction of the luxury on offer. There's a Jacuzzi, a sauna, an all weather tennis court, fully equipped gymnasium, a games room and bar and a garage.</p>

      <p>The property, built in 2008, has a German fitted breakfast kitchen and dining area with Silestone Quartz floors and work surfaces. This leads on to the orangery which is home to full panoramic views of the surrounding countryside - gorgeous.</p>
      <p>French doors from both kitchen and orangery provide access to the rear terrace and garden.</p>
      <p>The property, listed by Fine &amp; Country estate agents, has a classic country house look which is complemented with a contemporary-looking interior.</p>
      <p>There's a log burner in its principle lounge to keep you warm in the colder months.</p>
      <p>When it gets warmer again there's a large terrace, which you could to sit out on and watch the sunset.</p>
      <p>Its oak stairway leads up to an impressive master bedroom, with bags of room as it has a suspended mezzanine floor.</p>
      <p>The bedroom, which has a triple height ceiling, features an en suite divided in to two, so whoever is sharing can have even more of their own space.</p>
      <p>This floor is also home to three additional spacious double bedrooms, each with an en suite.</p>
      <p>If you've got guests over and they fancy a bit of their own private space, the property covers that too. There's a self-contained apartment accessed by a separate entrance under the main archway and away from the main house.</p>
      <p>The apartment is home to a large dining kitchen, a lounge, a double bedroom - complete with walk in wardrobes and en suite shower room facilities.</p>
      <p>Up to the second floor which accommodates two magnificent bedroom suites. One enjoying an en suite spa room with a curved glass sauna, changing area, twin showers and twin vanity wash hand basins.</p>
      <p>The second guest bedroom suite has an en suite spa room with a large circular warm air spa/Jacuzzi, not bad for a guest bedroom.</p>
      <p>If you own horses, you're in for a treat as the property has a stable block and an enclosed area to ride around in.</p>
      <p>If the property wasn't impressive enough, at nighttime it looks even more spectacular as automated illuminations light up the exterior.</p>
