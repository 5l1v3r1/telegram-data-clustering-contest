      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- United Technologies has received a $762.5 million contract modification to deliver F135 propulsion systems for the Air Force and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Marine_Corps/?tps=1">Marine Corps</a>.</p>
      <p>The new deal, announced Thursday by the Department of Defense, funds Lot 14 production and delivery of 48 F135-PW-100 propulsion systems for the Air Force and 10 F135-PW-600 propulsion systems for the Marine Corps.</p>
      <p>The Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 is a turbofan engine for the Lockheed Martin F-35 <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/F-35_Lightning_II/?tps=1">Lightning II</a>, fifth generation single-engine stealth fighters used the Air Force, Marines and Navy plan to replace much of their fleets with in future years.</p>
      <p>In October, Lockheed finalized a $34 billion deal with the Pentagon to deliver 478 F-35 fighter planes in production Lots 12, 13 and 14 at a cost below $80 million each. It's the largest contract in military history, and the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/10/29/Pentagon-Lockheed-reach-34B-deal-for-478-F-35s-as-price-per-aircraft-drops/8931572364012/">lowest per-plane cost for the F-35 series</a> yet.</p>
      <p>That deal came after pressure from the Pentagon to lower the per-plane cost of the aircraft, which has also faced scrutiny for production and <a href="https://www.defense.gov/explore/story/Article/2002585/dod-finalizes-purchase-plan-for-f-35-aircraft/">safety issues</a>.</p>
      <p>The new contract funds production of 48 F135-PW-100 engines for the US Air Force. The F135-PW-100 powers the Air Force's F-35A aircraft. Per the October deal, the Pentagon's expected cost per plane for the F-35A in Lot 14 in $77.9 million.</p>
      <p>The deal also funds 10 F135-PW-600 engines for the Marine Corps' F-35B. Lot 14 production F-35Bs are projected to cost $101.3 million per plane.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon has obligated fiscal 2020 aircraft procurement funds in the amount of $762 million -- it covers $521.5 million in purchases for the Air Force and $240.9 in Marine Corps.</p>
      <p>The bulk of work will be performed in East Hartford, Connecticut, with some work taking place in Indianapolis and Bristol, England.</p>
