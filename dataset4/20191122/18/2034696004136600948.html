      <p>Last month (October 29), <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/trent-reznor-ive-changed-my-opinion-on-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2562410">Reznor revealed that his stance on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has changed</a>, after previously hitting out at the award. Nine Inch Nails received a nomination to enter the hall back in 2016, but were not inducted. The group then failed to be nominated in the following two years, which led the frontman <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/trent-reznor-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-snub-2391766">to say that he “couldn’t give less of a shit” about being snubbed</a>.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/10/28/trent-reznor-talks-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nomination-and-david-bowie/#26b96bdd14ad"><i>Forbes</i></a>, the musician explained that he’s now “changed [his] opinion” on the matter – explaining that inducting <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-cure">The Cure</a> turned out to be “a pretty cool experience”.</p>
      <p>“So I’m sitting at a table with the <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/radiohead">Radiohead</a> guys, super-nice, and I think we all kind of looked at it like, ‘This could be bullshit.’ As we’re there, it kind of wasn’t bullshit,” he recalled of the evening.</p>
      <p>The artist also recently (November 14) celebrated his first ever Country Music Association Award.</p>
      <p>Reznor shared in the glory of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/billy-ray-cyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>‘ runaway hit <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/old-town-road-controversy-explained-2480098">‘Old Town Road’</a> taking home the prize for Musical Event of the Year at the CMA Awards on Wednesday, as the track features a short banjo composition sampled from NIN’s 2008 track ’34 Ghosts IV’.</p>
