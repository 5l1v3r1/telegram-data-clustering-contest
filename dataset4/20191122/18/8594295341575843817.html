      <p>From the Mustang Mach-E to the <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/tesla-unveils-cybertruck-in-la-39900-of-absolute-madness/">Cybertruck</a> in a matter of days. What a week it’s been. While the verdict is still coming in on Tesla’s, um, <i>interesting</i> take on an electric pickup, an auto giant and an upstart automaker that <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/lordstown-lost-general-motors-offloads-shuttered-chevy-cruze-plant/">just bought a big assembly plant</a> are happy to offer an alternative.</p>
      <p>Of course, neither General Motors nor Lordstown Motors have a physical, production-ready pickup to show you, but many would argue Tesla doesn’t, either. Yet both rival EV pickups are on the way, the companies claim. One’s already taking pre-orders.</p>
      <p>Announced this week, Lordstown Motors, which came to life earlier this year and recently purchased the mothballed GM Lordstown Assembly in northeast Ohio, is taking $1,000 deposits on the upcoming Endurance — its name for a conventionally styled crew cab electric pickup. Starting price for the Lordstown Endurance (seen above) is $52,500, with the fledgling company hoping to roll out the first examples in late 2020.</p>
      <p>First, Lordstown will have to raise some capital. Retooling is <a href="https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-attracted-by-workforce-as-much-as-plant/?utm_campaign=Regular%20Day%20to%20Day&amp;utm_content=105685854&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-314550535">expected to begin</a> at the facility within the next two months, but the automaker still needs to secure $300 million in financing to get the operation off the ground.</p>
      <p>Lordstown claims its truck will offer up to 260 miles of range.</p>
      <p>Far fewer details exist for GM’s upcoming EV pickup, though GM CEO Mary Barra took the opportunity this week to provide an update on the model’s timeline. As reported by <i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-ceo-electric-pickup/gms-electric-pickup-to-hit-dealer-showrooms-in-fall-2021-ceo-idUSKBN1XV21X">Reuters</a></i>, the unnamed truck will go on sale in the fall of 2021 — probably beating Cybertruck to the market.</p>
      <p>“It will be a very capable truck, I’m pretty excited about it,” Barra said of the vehicle, which will call Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly home. There’s a chance GM might revive the Hummer name for its upcoming EV.</p>
      <p>Ford, of course, has its own EV pickup in the works. GM’s effort seems to be a direct response to this challenge from the top-selling truck maker, and Ford’s electric F-150 may well beat GM to the market. Not to be outdone, Michigan-based upstart Rivian also expects to have an electric pickup, the R1T, in driveways that same year. Starting at $69,000, the R1T offers up to 400 miles of driving range.</p>
      <p>If and when the Cybertruck goes on sale, it won’t have the niche segment to itself.</p>
