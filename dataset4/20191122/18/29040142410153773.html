      <p><b>Best</b> microSD cards for Android Android Central 2019</p>
      <p>A microSD card lets you easily move your files, photos, and music from device to device without having to rely on steady Wi-Fi or costly data. It also helps if you like to load your phone up with apps, music, and movies if it didn't come with much internal storage to begin with.</p>
      <p>While microSD cards get sales quite frequently throughout the year, around <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, they tend to get even steeper discounts. When dozens of microSD cards are on sale for about the same price, it can make it harder to tell a good card from a dud, but don't worry! We're here to help you ensure that you score a deal on a card that's worthy to carry your digital life around on.</p>

      <h3>What do all these classes mean for your card?</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of different specs used to classify microSD card speeds, and most cards have at least two of these classifications in addition to the straight read/write speeds listed for the card. Here's your cheat sheet to these formats and which ones are better than others:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Video Speed Class</b> — Indicated by a stylized V followed by numbers from 6 to 90, this class is one of the newer classification systems and was developed specifically for shooting ultra-high-definition video. V30 starts at 30MB/s write speed, V60 starts at 60MB/s write speed, and V90 starts at 90MB/s, but unless your phone somehow shoots 8K video, you probably don't need a V90 card.</li>
        <li><b>UHS Speed Class</b> — Indicated by a 1, 2, or 3 inside a U, this class is still used on most cards today. U1 starts at 10MB/s write speed, U3 starts at 30MB/s write speed, and both are perfectly adequate for most Android phones.</li>
        <li><b>Speed Class</b> — Indicated by a number inside of a C, this was the original classification system for SD cards. Class 10 was as high as this class went, 10 MB/s write speed, and practically every card worth buying today is well beyond this speed at this point, so it's not as helpful an indicator of power/quality these days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may notice that all of these specs are focused on write speed — that tends to be the lower of the two rates on an SD card — so if you see a card with a "transfer" speed of 100MB/s but only a U3 class, the chances are that card has a read speed of 100MB/s and a write speed of 30MB/s.</p>
      <p>For most users that just want to use a microSD for storing app data, music and movies for offline playback, you'll be perfectly fine with a U1 or U3 card like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XWZWYVP?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU56871YYw">Samsung EVO Select</a>. If you're someone who intends to use a microSD card for shooting copious amounts of photos or 4K video, you might want to spring for a U3/V30 (30MB/s) or V60 card, such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U77V5IW?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU56871YYw">Lexar Professional 1000x</a>.</p>
      <h3>Check your phone before you buy</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/08/note-10-plus-micro-sd-card-tight-blue.jpg?itok=Qb3PueRw"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Like just about everything else in a phone, manufacturers have to license specific software for certain microSD card formats to work in their devices, and that's why some phones like the Galaxy Note 10+ say they take up to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P9W5HJV?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU56871YYw">a 1TB card</a> while other phones might only say they take up to a 128GB card.</p>
      <p>In most cases, you can stick a 256GB card in a phone only rated for 128GB and be fine, but I generally try to stick to the rated sizes so that if something goes wrong, support can't blame you for using too big of a card. And unless your phone specifically says it can take a 1TB card, don't waste your money on one, as capacities that high do need a phone rated to handle them.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday buying advice</h3>
      <p>There are going to be a lot of cards on sale on Black Friday, and like most other tech-related holiday sales, you'll want to keep in mind what device you're going to be using the card for. If you're buying a microSD card for that dashcam you just snagged in a Black Friday doorbuster, you'll want a card that doesn't mind extreme temperatures and will hold up under continuous recording, such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B984HJ5?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU56871YYw">Samsung Pro Endurance</a>, whereas a microSD card for that shiny new phone you're buying your daughter would be more concerned with speed and how well it handles running Android apps, so look for A1 or A2 on the card.</p>
      <p>Expect to see deals on most of the major brands — SanDisk, Samsung, Lexar — though deals are likely to be sweeter for some sizes than others. While 32 and 64GB cards can go as low as $5 on Black Friday, the best deals will almost assuredly be on 128GB cards because it is the most popular size bought today. However, I'm betting there will be some quicker doorbuster/Lightning deals on bigger 512GB cards for those who like to carry their entire lives on local storage.</p>
      <p>We'll be highlighting microSD deals throughout this hectic holiday shopping season on Android Central and Thrifter, so check back with us as we approach Black Friday to see what sale prices shake out.</p>
