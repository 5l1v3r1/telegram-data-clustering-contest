      <h1>'Glee' actress Jane Galloway Heitz dead at 78</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:03:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Will Thorne</a></address>
      <p>Jane Galloway Heitz, known for playing the character of Lillian Adler on “<a href="https://variety.com/t/glee/">Glee</a>,” has died, according to an obituary posted in the Chicago Tribune. She was 78.</p>
      <p>The actress only appeared in person twice on the Fox show, once in the pilot and on another occasion in 2015, as her character’s image appeared in a trophy case commemorating her life. A quote from Lillian, “By its very definition, <a href="https://variety.com/2018/music/news/lea-michele-darren-criss-tour-glee-1202747633/">Glee</a> is about opening yourself up to joy,” was visible on a plaque and helped inspire Will, played by Matthew Morrison, to pursue his dream of becoming the glee club director. Galloway Heitz’s character was herself a former head of glee club at McKinley High.</p>

      <p>On the film side, Galloway Heitz starred alongside Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek in David Lynch’s 1999 road movie “The Straight Story.” She also played a nurse opposite Lindsey Lohan in the 2007 psychological thriller “I Know Who Killed Me.” In 2001, Galloway Heitz played the intriguingly named Dinah the Drunk in the French-American movie “Just Visiting” with Jean Reno and Christina Applegate. The film was a remake of the wildly popular French fantasy comedy “Les Visiteurs,” but unlike the original, it turned out to be a box office flop.</p>
