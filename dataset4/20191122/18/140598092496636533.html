      <h1>Mike Lorenzo-Vera focuses on Ferrari dream but fears 'big dogs' biting him in Dubai</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-corrigan/" target="_blank">James Corrigan</a></address>
      <p>As if the vision of a top-of-the-range Ferrari is not enough for Mike Lorenzo-Vera to have burning on his mind then <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2019/11/21/rory-mcilroy-saves-best-last-takes-flight-eagle-world-tour-championship/">there are also two of the game’s most impressive young models zooming into his rearview mirror</a>. </p>
      <p>Yes, the weekend here at the Earth Course promises to be interesting to say the least for the maverick Frenchman, but then it also does for the European Tour as a whole as the final event of the season crowns its yearly winner.</p>
      <p>With the Race to Dubai also on the line, there are essentially two tournaments taking place here, but Lorenzo-Vera is solely focused on the DP World Tour Championship. Perhaps, overly focused. </p>
      <p>The event boasts a $3m (£2.35m) winning cheque, the biggest ever on the European circuit. For a 34-year-old without a victory in 193 starts on Tour that is quite the prospect and one that he will find impossible not to consider as he stands on 12-under with a three-shot advantage over <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2019/11/17/tommy-fleetwood-maintains-hopes-race-dubai-win-sun-city-success/">Tommy Fleetwood</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2017/07/17/jon-rahm-former-bomb-disposal-expert-helping-ensure-temper-will/">Jon Rahm</a>. </p>
      <p>After all, he was not even able to manage avoid committing the cardinal sin of the front-runner after the first round when his lead was only one. “Last night. I was trying to get the $3m out of my head, but my head did not want to, so I just accepted it and went on to the internet to see what car I'd buy if I won,” Lorenzo-Vera said. “And it would be a Ferrari f12 TdF.”</p>
      <p>With a base price of more than £300,000 that would be more than within his price range, although, after his 69, he showed he appreciates there is so much more left to do. “There are big dogs behind me and they are going to try to bite me,” Lorenzo-Vera said.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood and Rahm are, indeed, both of the dangerous variety, especially when there is not just the one trophy to sink their teeth into. Respectively, they are second and third on the Race to Dubai standings, trying to chase down the leader, Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger. </p>
      <p>During a second-round 71, Wiebserger looked worryingly tentative and he may have to adopt a more aggressive approach for these last two rounds. If the tournament was to be stopped now, then Fleetwood would win his second Harry Vardon Trophy in three years, as well as the $2m bonus. </p>

      <p>However, a one-shot swing to Rahm and the 25-year-old would become just the second Spanish winner after Severiano Ballesteros. It is that tight and when you factor in the likes of Rory McIlroy on seven-under, after a 74, the picture becomes more complicated still. The maths are flying everywhere.</p>
      <p>“It'll be the classic case of trying to stay in the moment and taking each shot as it comes,” Fleewood said, following his 68. “The more you can stay in your bubble, the greater chance you will have. But that will simply get harder and harder to do the longer this event goes on.”</p>
