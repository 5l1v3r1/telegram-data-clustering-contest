      <h1>Apple Removes Customer Reviews From Online Store</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:25:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Several days ago Apple quietly removed customer reviews from its online store, and we don’t know if they will reappear (<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/21/apple-pulls-all-customer-reviews-from-online-apple-store">via</a> <i>AppleInsider</i>).</p>
      <h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
      <p>The move is clearly intentional because it affects online stores in Australia, the U.S, and the U.K. If only one store was affected then that would suggest a bug.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, photography blog FStoppers published a YouTube video called “Apple Fanboys, Where is your God now?” In which the host reads negative reviews of the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>But it’s unknown whether that was a factor in the removal (My guess: probably not).</p>
