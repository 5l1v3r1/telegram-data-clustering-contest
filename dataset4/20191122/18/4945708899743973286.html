      <h1>Google admits its 'dark skin' face scan project violated internal policy, leading to overhaul</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:19:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:19</time> by <a rel="author">Ginger Adams Otis and Nancy Dillon</a></address>
      <p>Google is working to save face.</p>
      <p>The tech giant admitted it's making changes after a New York Daily News investigation found its facial recognition field research project targeted homeless people, cash-strapped <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/college+students/">college students</a> and subjects with "darker" skin.</p>
      <p>Google said an internal investigation prompted by the Daily News' expose last month uncovered policy violations among the third-party contractors who worked out of its offices but went into the streets each day to solicit face scans with $5 gift cards as incentive.</p>
      <p>The violations led the company to halt and overhaul the project, and now future face scans for <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/product+development/">product development</a> will be limited to Google campuses only, meaning no further public data collection in the field, a source confirmed to the Daily News on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the Daily News published its story last month, Google suspended the facial scan program and started a full investigation, a spokesman told the Daily News at the time.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a spokesman acknowledged to the Daily News that its internal probe revealed a flawed data collection process.</p>
      <p>"We found that the conduct was in violation of our training and scripts, and our policies on voluntary studies," the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"Going forward, the work will be done on Google sites only, to ensure we have better control over the research and the interactions with participants," he said.</p>
      <p>The spokesman defended the spirit of the project, saying its goal was to build "greater inclusivity in our products, including the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/security+features/">security features</a> on Made by Google devices."</p>
      <p>He called the goal "important and necessary."</p>
      <p>Google launched the internal probe after multiple people who worked on the project told the Daily News one or more of the project leads pushed them to use predatory tactics.</p>
      <p>They said Google desperately wanted more face scans from people with "darker skin tones" so products like the face-unlock feature on its Pixel 4 smartphone wouldn't suffer from a racial bias.</p>
      <p>Facial recognition technology has a history of being good at recognizing white faces but much less accurate when it comes to people with darker skin.</p>
      <p>With the goal of fine-tuning its biometric features with more diverse data, Google hired teams of temps through staffing partner Randstad, gave some of them workspace at a Google office in Venice, Calif., and then sent them out into the field to solicit scans.</p>
      <p>One team was sent to Atlanta. An ex-hire with knowledge of the trip said the explicit goal was to target people with "darker skin."</p>
      <p>The staffer said a Randstad manager specifically instructed the team to target black homeless people in Atlanta because "they're the least likely to say anything to the media."</p>
      <p>The Daily News obtained photos of people lined up to trade their face scans for the $5 gift cards in an Atlanta park known as a gathering place for <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/homeless+people/">homeless people</a>.</p>
      <p>The report prompted Atlanta's city attorney to send a letter to top Google execs demanding answers and rebuking the company for allegedly "exploiting" the city's "most vulnerable populations."</p>
      <p>Others who worked on the Google project told the Daily News they felt pressured to maximize their collections by rushing subjects through the consent agreement and positioning the scan as a "mini game" or new app that needed testing.</p>
      <p>The Daily News watched two Google contractors collect face scans from students in a study lounge inside the main library at California State University, Long Beach on Aug. 28.</p>
      <p>Wearing backpacks and looking like students themselves, the two men walked from table to table offering the gift cards in exchange for 3-D face scans that several students later said they didn't realize they were selling.</p>
      <p>A university spokesman told the Daily News the school was surprised Google contractors were secretly soliciting scans from students.</p>
      <p>"The university found your report disturbing. We had no knowledge that Google subcontractors were on campus engaged in this work," CSULB spokesman Gregory Woods told the Daily News.</p>
      <p>"It would not have been our practice to permit this activity in our library," he said.</p>
