      <h1>Salman Khan issues chilling warning to Siddharth Shukla, dares him for physical fight either inside or outside Bigg Boss house</h1>

      <p>Bollywood megastar and <i>Bigg Boss </i>show’s host Salman Khan has reportedly lashed out at contestant Siddharth Shukla and reminded him of the consequences of his bad behaviour. Salman also reminded him of consequences if he wants to stay in the ‘industry.’ In another extraordinary development, Salman challenged Siddharth for a fight either inside the <i>Bigg Boss </i>house or outside.</p>

      <p>An angry Salman told Siddharth bluntly that if he was so keen to <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/siddharth-shukla-is-evicted-from-bigg-boss-social-media-abuzz-with-rumours-as-support-for-asim-riaz-grows/273348/">flaunt his muscle power,</a> then he should try that on the former either inside the reality show or outside. “Shukla ji, you have plenty of anger and you have a huge physique. Would you like to try it (on me) at some point? Come out and try it (on me). Or call me inside the house,” said Salman menacingly.</p>
      <p>Salman also reportedly asked Siddharth if he had no intention to work in the industry, implying that he will have no work if his violent behaviour continued.</p>

      <p>Salman also said without naming any contestant, “If I had the right to evict one housemate, then I would have done so right now.”</p>

      <p>Salman also criticised Asim Riaz for provoking Siddharth and asked him he had become arrogant. He asked Asim if his reaction was due to his arrogance or self-esteem. Asim replied saying that it was his self-esteem, prompting Salman to ask if the contestant knew the difference between the two.</p>

      <p>Salman also asked Asim to walk out of the show after the latter said that if the allegations against him that he pushed other contestants without provocation were true, then he will walk out of the show. Salman replied, “Then you will have to walk out of the show.”</p>

      <p>Siddharth and Asim have been fighting violently all through this week. Many concluded that Siddharth ought to have been evicted for his repeated violent behaviour, but he has stayed in the show.</p>
      <p>As reported by <i>Janta Ka Reporter, </i>Khesari Lal Yadav was evicted from the show through the votes of the housemates.</p>
