      <h1>Tottenham reportedly want Boubakary Soumare, but do Arsenal need him more?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:45:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham are reportedly interested in signing Lille midfielder Boubakary Soumare in the January transfer window following Jose Mourinho’s appointment as Spurs manager, but do their north London rivals Arsenal need him more?</p>
      <p>Soumare, 20, has become rated as one of the best young midfielders in European football after shining in the red and blue of Lille last season. The former PSG academy player was crucial in helping Lille qualify for the Champions League.</p>
      <p>He has continued his excellent form this season, attracting the reported interest of Tottenham  – <a href="https://www.jeunesfooteux.com/LOSC-Mercato-enorme-coup-dur-pour-Lille-et-Galtier-_a39165.html">as per French outlet Jeunes Footeux.</a> The report also claims that Spurs are interested in Nigeria international Victor Osimhen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzzsport.fr/buzz/foot/mercato-losc-un-joueur-a-plus-de-50-millions-deuros-98241">Another report from Buzz Sport claims</a> that Lille would be willing to sell France Under-21 international Soumare for a fee of £43million, which could see Spurs move for the youngster. But do The Gunners need him more than Spurs?</p>

      <p>Certainly, Tottenham are well stocked in central midfield and spending such a figure on a central midfielder may be deemed a waste. Spurs boast Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko, Tanguy Ndombele, Oliver Skipp, Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama.</p>
      <p>Arsenak, meanwhile, are lacking in that position. Lucas Torreira has been linked with a move to Napoli and the Uruguay international’s agent has confirmed that there is interest in him. Granit Xhaka is also expected to leave in January.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder stormed off the field after being jeered by the home support against Crystal Palace. He has since been stripped of the Gunners captaincy, and has been linked with a move to Newcastle United and AC Milan.</p>
      <p>That leaves just Real Madrid loanee Dani Ceballos – who is injured – and French youngster Matteo Guendouzi. Arsenal are in desperate need for central midfielders, and Soumare would be the perfect addition if The Gunners become interested.</p>
