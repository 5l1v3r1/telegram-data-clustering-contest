      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/vivienne-getting-married-drag-race-royalty-chad-michaels-dressed-cher-11202222/">The Vivienne</a> enjoyed an evening on the town last night after being declared the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/drag-race-uk-winner-rupaul-vivienne-baga-chipz-divina-dicampo-11197257/">winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</a>.</p>
      <p>The Liverpudlian queen was named Britain’s first ever Drag Race superstar after pipping fellow finalists <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/rupauls-drag-race-uk-star-divina-de-campos-sister-welcomes-first-child-pregnant-drag-transformation-11163059/">Divina de Campo</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/rupauls-drag-race-uk-star-baga-chipz-signs-up-for-celebrity-first-dates-11012236/">Baga Chipz</a> to the post as she slayed the group performance of Rock It (To the Moon) and stunned in an incredible pale pink gown on the runway.</p>

      <p>But while Thursday night proved to be the night that the viewers found out that The Vivienne won the show, it was also the queens’ first time hearing the news too, as Drag Race films winning sequences for all the final competitors to avoid the result leaking.</p>
      <p>Appearing alongside her fellow finalists at a viewing party hosted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a>, Viv looked majestic in a high necked black gown encrusted with hundreds of glittering stones.</p>
      <p>With her hair in a glamorous blond up do, the 27-year-old queen looked every inch the champion as she chatted with a friend in the smoking area.</p>

      <p>Keeping her heels on on the streets outside, The Vivienne lifted her train as she walked across the rain soaked road – a task we hope she’ll never have to do again now that she’s been named the UK’s Drag Race superstar.</p>
      <p>Surely one of the Brit Crew can carry it around for her, right?</p>

      <p>As the winner of the show, The Vivienne has been given an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/rupauls-drag-race-uk-prizes-leaves-fans-bitterly-disappointed-10860106/">all expenses paid trip to Los Angeles</a>, creating her own YouTube series with production company, World of Wonder.</p>
      <p>But it seems like the queen has already got off to a good start after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/rupauls-drag-race-uks-vivienne-baga-chipz-getting-trump-thatcher-show-11202796/">bagging her own comedy series</a> alongside fellow finalist Baga.</p>
