      <h2>Premium Japanese car brand Lexus are launching a new drop-top machine – the LC 500 Convertible – that looks as if it is going to be a seriously tasty offering.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:55:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Russon</a></address>
      <p>THE wraps have come off the Lexus LC 500 Convertible – the first open-top car in the Japanese car maker’s portfolio for more than five years.</p>
      <p>Unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lexus">the new Lexus machine</a> will be available in the UK next September, with prices expected to be north of the £80,000 mark.</p>
      <p>Based on the LC 500 Coupe, the convertible has a stiffened body to aid handling and a 2+2 seating arrangement. The hood can be opened and closed in around 15 seconds and at speeds of up to 30mph.</p>

      <p>Powered by the same 5.0-litre V8 engine Lexus uses in the LC coupe, the convertible is expected to have similar performance with a 0-62mph time of less than five seconds and a top speed in excess of 160mph.</p>
      <p>The engine is mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission and the car is fitted with a sound generator which transmits the engine note through the dashboard for extra thrill.</p>
      <p>Lexus says it focussed on aerodynamic elements such as the beltline and rear moulding in creating the LC 500 Convertible and a transparent polycarbonate wind deflector is fitted to manage wind flow and maintain quietness in the cabin.</p>

      <p>The company says this preserves the special feel of open-air driving while still making conversation possible.</p>
      <p>The LC 500 Convertible is also equipped with Active Noise Control and benefits from sound insulation and absorption measures to suppress unwanted noise and other unpleasant sound frequencies.</p>
      <p>Lexus’s first open top car in the UK was the SC 430, which was followed by a convertible of the IS model that was last produced in 2015.</p>
