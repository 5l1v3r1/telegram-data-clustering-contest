      <h3>Expand your Fire Tablet's storage in no time at all</h3>
      <p>Any of the above cards will give your Fire Tablet a nice storage boost. Still, if we're recommending one out of them all, our top pick goes to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B073JYVKNX?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU58421YYw">SanDisk 64GB MicroSD Card</a>. 64GB is a lot of extra space for loading up your local files, and when you add that together with great transfer speeds and a solid price, you have an enticing package.</p>
      <p>Then again, if you know you have a <i>lot</i> of movies and games to store, you might need something more substantial.</p>
      <p>In that case, we'd recommend splurging for either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MicroSD-Adapter-MB-ME128GA-AM/dp/B06XWZWYVP?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU58421YYw">Samsung EVO Select 128GB MicroSD Card</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Ultra-200GB-Micro-Adapter/dp/B073JY5T7T?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU58421YYw">SanDisk Ultra 200GB MicroSD Card</a>. Both offer a lot more space without breaking the bank, giving you plenty of options to choose from.</p>
      <h3>How to find the best Black Friday deals on memory cards for your Amazon Fire Tablet</h3>
      <p>Memory cards (or microSD cards) are pretty simple gadgets. They add more storage to your device, giving you more space to store movies, music, games, and more. The higher the number on the card you buy, the more digital content you'll be able to store. A 16GB microSD card will be alright if you just need a little more space, but if you plan on loading your Fire Tablet up with as many movies as possible, you'll want to splurge for something roomier — like a 128GB or 200GB card. In addition to the storage size, each microSD card also comes with different transfer speeds. This determines how fast your content is loaded onto the card. The faster the transfer speeds are, the more quickly you'll be able to load the card up with all of your files.</p>
      <p>So, what kind of Black Friday deals are we expecting to see on microSD cards during 2019? You can look forward to sales and discounts on cards of all shapes and sizes from just about every company. SanDisk is bound to offer some exciting savings, as is Samsung with its EVO cards. You'll also want to keep an eye out for what Silicon Power and PNY have to offer. The savings here have the potential to be huge, and as such, may sell out quickly. If you spot a deal that catches your fancy, it's best to purchase sooner rather than later to ensure you don't miss out.</p>
      <p>As we come across any Black Friday offers on memory cards for the Amazon Fire Tablet, we'll get this guide updated ASAP so you can stay up-to-date with the best savings out there. We're also doing this for a ton of other products and accessories, so be sure to check out all of our Black Friday content on Android Central for the season's best shopping/deal coverage.</p>
