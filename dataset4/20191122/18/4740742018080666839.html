      <h1>Music star Solo 45 'waterboarded and raped' woman, court hears</h1>
      <h2>Warning: Evidence can include graphic details that some readers may find upsetting</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:35:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">Claire Hayhurst, PA, Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>A woman allegedly held against her will and repeatedly raped by a music star "feared she was going to die", a jury heard.</p>
      <p>Andy Anokye, 32, who performs under the stage name <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/solo-45-trial-court-live-3560956">Solo 45</a>, denies 31 charges against him at Bristol Crown Court.</p>
      <p>The charges, relating to four complainants, include 22 counts of rape and five counts of false imprisonment.</p>
      <p>He also denies two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Jurors have been told that Anokye, who had a flat in Millennium Parade in Bristol city centre, was a member of the grime collective Boy Better Know.</p>
      <p>Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, alleged that Anokye told the complainants that he was "sadistic" and "got off on people crying".</p>

      <p>He is alleged to have held one woman against her will after seeing text messages between her and a friend that referred to the rapper Drake.</p>
      <p>"He accused her of being a traitor, of wanting to sleep with everyone," Mr Quinlan said</p>
      <p>"He called her and her friends 'groupies' who wanted to sleep with big stars like him and Drake.</p>
      <p>"He said that he was going to teach her a lesson."</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said Anokye told the woman to get into a bath of "freezing cold" water.</p>
      <p>The musician then placed a flannel over her face and sprayed it with water, the jury heard.</p>
      <p>"He interrogated her at the same time," Mr Quinlan said.</p>
      <p>"He wanted her to admit that she wanted to sleep with all of the Boy Better Know group.</p>

      <p>"She thought her life was on the line. She feared she was going to die that day.</p>
      <p>"He filmed events with his telephone."</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan previously told the jury that Anokye "imprisoned, assaulted, sexually violated and raped" the four complainants in the case.</p>
      <p>Police examining three mobile phones and a laptop found at Anokye's home after his arrest discovered searches for "dacryphilia".</p>
      <p>Jurors have been told this is sexual arousal from another's fear.</p>
      <p>Anokye, of Millennium Promenade, Bristol, denies all the charges against him and the trial continues.</p>
