      <p>Stephanie Gregory had no idea she was pregnant, until she went into labour.</p>
      <p>The bartender, then 22, dismissed her stomach ache as a tummy bug which was going round work, until the pain forced her to go to hospital.</p>
      <p>Gregory, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, England was taking the contraceptive injection and had no pregnancy symptoms.</p>
      <p>She even downed beer during her pregnancy with daughter Sapphire, now eight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>In an exclusive interview, Gregory, now 30, tells her story:</b>
      </p>
      <p>As I opened my eyes, I clutched my stomach and groaned in pain.</p>
      <p>“Oh no,” I panicked. “I’ve caught that bug.” I sickness bug had been going around the bar where I worked as a bartender.</p>
      <p>Loads of people were off sick, so I’d agreed to come in and cover a shift. Even though I didn’t feel great, I struggled out of bed.</p>
      <p>It was October 31, so I knew the boozer would be busy with Halloween celebrations – and they’d be really short-staffed if I didn’t go in.</p>
      <p>Feeling determined, I stumbled out of bed and splashed some cold water on my face.</p>
      <p>Then I put on my work uniform and got on my bike, for the 15-minute cycle from my apartment to work.</p>
      <p>Thanks to my bike, I’d lost two stone over the previous five months – my tummy was flatter than it had ever been.</p>
      <p>Once at the bar, I began my eight-hour shift pulling pints and rushing back and forth from the kitchen.</p>
      <p>But my stomach ache continued to get worse.</p>
      <p>“Is it OK if I go home early?” I asked my boss, with two hours still to go. “I’m not feeling very well.”</p>
      <p>He told me to rest up and feel better soon, so I stumbled out of work and popped into see my mom Mandy, a waitress in the working men’s club below my flat.</p>
      <p>Her face dropped as soon as she saw me. “You’re so white,” she told me. “Go and run yourself a deep bath.”</p>
      <p>I tried to relax in the tub, but it did nothing for the pain.</p>
      <p>Climbing out of the water, I texted my mom: “It’s not getting any better.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe it’s your appendix,” she replied. “I think I should take you to hospital.”</p>
      <p>Mom left work and drove me to the emergency room, with my dad Darren joining soon after, having been filled in by mom.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before I was seen by a nurse, who asked me to take a urine sample, thinking it might be a UTI.</p>
      <p>When she received the results, she looked at me oddly. “Is there any chance you could be pregnant?” she asked.</p>
      <p>I looked at my parents in disbelief. “No,” I snapped.</p>
      <p>I’d been taking the contraceptive injection for at least nine months, and I didn’t have a bump or any other signs.</p>
      <p>I’d briefly dated a guy called Jon a few months back, but it hadn’t worked out.</p>
      <p>What the nurse told me next made me physically shudder: “You are definitely pregnant.”</p>
      <p>“How pregnant?” my mom asked. “Stephanie will be leaving with a baby today,” the nurse replied.</p>
      <p>Mom and Dad looked at each other, gobsmacked. “I’m having a baby today?” I asked, stunned.</p>
      <p>“You’re in labor now,” the nurse said, smiling.</p>
      <p>Before I could get to grips with what was happening, I was taken into a side room in the maternity unit for a scan.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, it isn’t clear enough to determine the sex,” the sonographer said, as she traced the Doppler over my flat belly.</p>
      <p>Hearing the heartbeat made everything more real, but I was still in shock.</p>
      <p>I was taken through to the delivery suite and puffed and panted throughout the night, while Mom held my hand.</p>
      <p>Dad was on my other side, mopping my brow.</p>
      <p>Finally, at 7.38am on November 1, my little girl entered the world. Sapphire was born weighing a healthy 7lb 5oz.</p>
      <p>“She’s beautiful,” my parents cooed. Luckily, there had been no complications.</p>
      <p>Considering I’d had no antenatal appointments, I was lucky to have such a healthy baby.</p>
      <p>One of the midwives explained it was likely I didn’t have a bump because Sapphire had been positioned at the back, while my placenta was at the front.</p>
      <p>Weirdly, I’d lost weight during my pregnancy, rather than putting it on.</p>
      <p>I grimaced when I thought of all the things I shouldn’t have done in the last nine months.</p>
      <p>I had knocked back beer, dyed my hair, and weaved in and out of traffic on my bike every day. I’d even been lifting heavy beer barrels at work.</p>
      <p>The midwives, and later my parents, showed me how to feed and care for Sapphire.</p>
      <p>I stayed with her in hospital overnight, until doctors confirmed we were safe to go home the next day.</p>
      <p>Once I was settled back home, my sisters Kirsty and Kimberley and brother Luke came over to see my baby.</p>
      <p>They brought a collection of baby clothes and other bits, donated by friends and family.</p>
      <p>Mom and Dad bought me a Moses basket and other essentials, which I put in my spare room, now Sapphire’s nursery.</p>
      <p>But there was still one thing I needed to do.</p>
      <p>I messaged Jon on Facebook, asking him to call me. When we spoke, I broke the news he was now a dad.</p>
      <p>There was silence down the phone. “Can I call you later?” he asked. I could tell he was shocked.</p>
      <p>After I put Sapphire down for a nap, I sent Jon some photos. “She’s gorgeous,” he texted back.</p>
      <p>Once the news had sunk in, Jon came over to see Sapphire. We didn’t get back together, but her dad is a big part of her life.</p>
      <p>Now Sapphire is growing up fast, but I’ll never forget the fright she gave me on Halloween.</p>
