      <p>George Conway criticized his wife, Kellyanne Conway, as he continued to take shots at President Trump on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"I have little doubt that, within the lifespans of many reading this tweet, students throughout the world will learn in their history books that a deeply psychologically unwell man — also a criminal — was president of the United States in the late 2010s," Conway said Friday on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Sportswriter Larry Brooks responded to Conway's tweet, saying, "Your wife is an enabler. Your wife is a cheerleader. What kind of game do you think you’re playing?"</p>

      <p>"She’s both, but that doesn’t mean I’m playing a game," Conway responded. The comment is a part of the attorney's long-running feud with Trump that has spilled into his marriage as Kellyanne is the counselor to the president.</p>

      <p>Trump took aim at George on Friday morning, calling him a "nut job." "Kellyanne is great, but she's married to a total whack job," Trump said, adding that she must have done "some bad things" to George <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-kellyanne-must-have-done-bad-things-to-george-conway-to-make-him-crazy">because he "is crazy."</a></p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-conway-suggests-trump-has-narcissistic-personality-disorder">vendetta between the two men</a> has only escalated since impeachment proceedings began. George <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-dont-frankly-want-to-be-on-television-george-conway-makes-rare-tv-appearance-for-impeachment-hearings">appeared on MSNBC</a> to commentate before the first public impeachment hearing. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/im-embarrassed-for-you-kellyanne-conway-steams-after-clip-of-husbands-msnbc-commentary-played">Kellyanne criticized the move</a> saying it was only meant to hurt her.</p>
      <p>Sources close to George said he loves Kellyanne and wants to stay with her, but she would need to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/shes-in-a-cult-george-conway-can-make-marriage-work-if-kellyanne-leaves-white-house">leave the "cult"</a> of the White House. Kellyanne <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/powerful-woman-kellyanne-conway-mocks-and-threatens-reporter-for-mentioning-her-husband-audio">maintains that any power</a> George has he gets through her. She has been critical of media outlets covering the pair's marriage.</p>
