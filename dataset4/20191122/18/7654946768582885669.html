      <h1>Ex-Boston College student pleads not guilty to goading boyfriend to kill himself</h1>

      <p>A former Boston College student <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/boston-college-student-accused-of-driving-boyfriend-alexander-urtulam-to-suicide/">charged in her boyfriend’s suicide</a> pleaded not guilty on Friday — as prosecutors claimed she threatened to slash her own throat as a way of controlling the troubled victim.</p>
      <p>Inyoung You, a 21-year-old South Korea native, pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges in the death of 22-year-old Alexander Urtula, who leaped from a parking garage hours before he was set to graduate from Boston College on May 20.</p>
      <p>Suffolk County prosecutors said Friday that You vowing to cut her throat was yet another example of how controlling she was over Urtula, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/22/former-student-accused-driving-boyfriend-commit-suicide-due-court/qWd4fSu27CumH7Wuj91WQN/story.html">the Boston Globe reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“You want me to slash my throat, is that what you want?” she allegedly texted Urtula on May 18.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors included the exchange — among more than 75,000 text messages the couple sent each other in the two months prior to Urtula’s suicide — as evidence against You.</p>
      <p>Her bail was set at $5,000 and she was also ordered to surrender her passport.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Caitlin Grosso said You was the dominant personality in the couple’s 18-month relationship that eventually overwhelmed Urtula, who had no prior mental health issues, his family has said.</p>
      <p>In one journal entry from March, Urtula wrote that his girlfriend attacked his “self-worth” and wrote to You at another point, “I asked you to stop so many times,” the Globe reported.</p>
      <p>You lashed out against her boyfriend, threatening to kill herself on video and blame Urtula for her demise.</p>
      <p>“Abuse?” You wrote Urtula in one text, prosecutors said. “You think I abuse you? You [expletive] think I abuse you? … Please tell me how you’re the victim here, please enlighten me … I have to threaten my life for you to listen to me?”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, text messages provided to the Boston Globe purportedly showed You trying to stop Urtula before he took his own life. In one message, she wrote “STOP” in all caps after he wrote “good bye” to his girlfriend, according to the Boston-based Rasky Partners, a public relations firm representing the woman.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors <a href="https://www.suffolkdistrictattorney.com/press-releases/items/2019/10/28/former-bc-student-indicted-for-boyfriends-suicide?rq=inyoung">claimed You told Urtula to “go die” or “go kill yourself”</a> in some of their text messages.</p>
      <p>A trial date has been set for November 2020. If convicted, You faces up to 20 years in prison.</p>
