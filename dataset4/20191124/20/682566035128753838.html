      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Tshwane Spartans</b> capitalised on a late batting meltdown by the <b>Jozi Stars</b> to snatch a <b>20-run</b> victory where defeat looked almost a certainty in their latest Mzansi Super League (MSL) derby encounter at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Sunday.</p>
      <p>On a day that Chris Gayle finally delivered - the West Indian superstar plundered 54 off 27 balls (6 fours, 4 sixes) - to set the defending champions up for what looked like a first win of the season as they eyed a 156-run victory target.</p>
      <p>However, from 122 for three and only 34 required from 38 balls, they imploded spectacularly to be dismissed for 135.</p>
      <p>It meant the last seven wickets fell for 13 runs with Morne Morkel the biggest benefactor, finishing with three for 21 in 3.3 overs.</p>
      <p>Roelof van der Merwe claimed two for 11, while England paceman Tom Curran, who picked up the early wickets, recorded three for 30.</p>
      <p>The result meant that the Stars, the winners of the inaugural title last year, have now lost six out of six and are affectively already out of play-off contention.</p>
      <p>For the Spartans, they are up to third on the table, and continue to show a vast improvement compared to last season where they finished second bottom.</p>
      <p>Like Gayle did for the Stars, it was a day when the other big superstar of MSL 2.0, AB de Villiers, delivered his first big performance of the season - the former Standard Bank Proteas captain striking 53 off 33 balls (4 fours, 2 sixes).</p>
      <p>But it was not all plain sailing for his side, who slipped to 47 for four after winning the toss and batting.</p>
      <p>An Aaron Phangiso (2/32) double pegged the Spartans back early with Theunis de Bruyn (0), Dean Elgar (18), Van der Merwe (5) and Heinrich Klaasen (10) all gone inside the first 10 overs.</p>
      <p>But De Villiers and Pite van Biljon (45) rebuilt with a 63-run fifth-wicket stand that proved key in helping their side recover to 155 for six.</p>
      <p>Dan Christian finished as the pick of the bowlers with two for 30.</p>
      <p>Curran then brilliantly cleaned up Reeza Hendricks for a first-over duck early in the reply, before Gayle and captain Temba Bavuma (35) sharing 64 in only 4.5 overs for the second wicket.</p>
      <p>The momentum continued even after Gayle fell, with Rassie van der Dussen (20) helping his skipper keep up with the pace.</p>
      <p>When they were together, even a bonus point looked on the cards as victory appeared a formality with seven overs to go.</p>
      <p>However, the losing mentality that has currently clouded over the Starsâ€™ camp appeared to kick in as the rest of their batsmen panicked and gifted Tshwane a second win.</p>
