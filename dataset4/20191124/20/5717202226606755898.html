      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10413236/wolves-otasowie-transfer-arsenal-psg-liverpool/">The Sun reports</a> that the Gunners want the 18-year-old, while Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Schalke also monitoring his situation.</p>
      <p>The report notes that the teenager is out of contract at the end of the season. It remains to be seen whether he has any interest in signing a new deal with Wolves.</p>

      <h3>After Boly reports, could Otasowie be the Wolves defender Arsenal sign?</h3>
      <p>Otasowie is not the first Wolves defender Arsenal have been linked with this season. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10075764/arsenal-willy-boly-transfer-wolves-defence/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1570353805">The Sun reported back in October</a> that Unai Emery wanted Willy Boly to be the answer to the Gunners’ defensive problems.</p>
      <p>With Boly sustaining a serious injury soon after, it appears that a move in the near future is highly unlikely. But perhaps Otasowie could prove to be the Wolves defender that Arsenal manage to sign.</p>
      <p>Of course, they are at vastly different stages of their career. Boly would have arguably been an important signing for the next few years.</p>
      <p>Judging by the interest in Otasowie, he could be an incredibly exciting signing for Arsenal. But it may not be a deal that does not alleviate much of the fans’ current discontent.</p>
