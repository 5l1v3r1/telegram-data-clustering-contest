      <p>TORONTO -- A pilot had to be rescued in Minnesota after a single-engine plane became tangled in power lines, and got stuck hanging upside down by one wheel.</p>
      <p>Scott County Sheriff’s Office said<a href="https://www.scottcountymn.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=623"> in a press release</a> that they had received word shortly before 4 p.m. on Saturday that a plane had struck power lines in Louisville Township, which is located about 48 kilometres southwest of Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
      <p>The press release said the plane was a “single-engine prop Piper Cub,” and that it had been travelling south before the collision with the power lines.</p>
      <p>“Once the power line was de-energized, the pilot was rescued from the plane,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>The pilot has been identified as 65-year-old Thomas Koskovich, of Shakopee, Minn. He was successfully extracted from the plane with no injuries.</p>
      <p>Dramatic photos taken by the sheriff’s office show the plane completely flipped over, suspended in the air by seemingly just one wire.</p>
      <p>“This incident could have been much worse,” said Sheriff Luke Hennen. “We are grateful the pilot was able to walk away without any injuries.”</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will be investigating the crash.</p>
