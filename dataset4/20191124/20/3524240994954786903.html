      <h1>Ligue 1: Bordeaux edge 10-man Monaco to go third</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:14:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Depleted Bordeaux edged in-form Monaco 2-1 at home on Sunday to claw back into the top three in Ligue 1.</p>
      <p>“All victories are important for us but especially at a difficult time,” said Bordeaux manager Paulo Sousa.</p>
      <p>Already deprived of defenders Edson Mexer and Vukasin Jovanovic who were both suspended, midfielder Youssef Ait Bennasser, who could not play because he is on-loan from Monaco, Bordeaux lost centre-back Laurent Koscielny to injury on Sunday morning and winger Jimmy Briand during the warm-up.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Cafu, who was on-loan at Red Star Belgrade last season, made his first appearance since 2018 on the left side of a back five and struggled.</p>
      <p>Monaco, who had climbed away from the relegation zone with three victories in their previous four league games, took the lead with a goal by Islam Slimani on 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>After that, even though the hosts’ fans fell silent in the first half as part of a protest against their owners, the visitors failed to exploit the makeshift home defence.</p>
      <p>Brazilian Pablo levelled with a powerful header from a corner after 29 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the 67th minute, Slimani handled while standing in the wall at a free kick, conceding a penalty and incurring his second yellow card.</p>
      <p>Nicolas de Preville coolly converted the spot-kick to give Bordeaux victory.</p>
      <p>“There were a lot of players from the starting 11 who were not here,” Bordeaux midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said.</p>
      <p>“This shows the strength of character of our team. Some of them didn’t have much playing time this season. They stood up.”</p>
      <p>Later on Sunday, Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier as the sides managed just two shots on target.</p>
      <p>Bordeaux climbed to 22 points from 14 matches, 11 behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain and two behind Angers. They lead Marseille, who visit Toulouse later on Sunday, on goal difference.</p>
      <p>Saint-Etienne are fifth, also on 22 points. Montpellier moved to sixth two points further back.</p>
