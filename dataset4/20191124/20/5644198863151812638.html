      <p>India are open to playing a day-night test in Australia next year but there has to be proper planning, skipper Virat Kohli said after his team won their maiden pink-ball test against Bangladesh on Sunday.</p>
      <p>KOLKATA, India: India are open to playing a day-night test in Australia next year but there has to be proper planning, skipper Virat Kohli said after his team won their maiden pink-ball test against Bangladesh on Sunday.</p>
      <p>India declined Australia's offer to play a day-night test in Adelaide last year, citing lack of experience, but took a little over two days to clinch their first pink-ball test, thrashing Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs in Kolkata.</p>

      <p>With day-night tests seen as a possible solution to test cricket's dwindling attendances, Australia are hopeful that India will agree to play one at the Gabba next year.</p>
      <p>Kohli, however, said it could not be on short notice.</p>
      <p>"There has to be planning for a pink-ball game," Kohli said, pointing to the struggle of a Bangladesh team whose pink-ball inexperience was laid bare in their comprehensive defeat in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>"We played on home conditions. You ask Bangladesh and they'd have liked a practice game before this game.</p>
      <p>"Just because we know these conditions and our bowlers are bowling so well, we don't really feel the challenge..."</p>
      <p>"A good practice game before that and enough time to prepare, we're open to anything. You can't just play it on a short notice."</p>
      <p>Pink balls are used in all day-night tests for visibility reasons, but behave differently to the red ones, with players having commented that they swing more and do not spin as much.</p>
      <p>Kohli smashed 136 before India declared their first innings on 347-9 and his quicks wreaked havoc with the heavily-lacquered ball to rout Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Kohli revealed how they tweaked their approach to the first two sessions after a suggestion from batting great Sachin Tendulkar to overcome the challenge of batting under lights.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to him on the evening of the first day and he made a very interesting point - that with the pink ball, you have to treat the second session like the morning session of a normal test when it's getting darker and the ball starts to swing and seam," he said.</p>
      <p>"So your planning changes, your declaration strategy and timing, everything changes. As a batsman, your setup changes.</p>
      <p>"Even if you are set and batting well, as soon as it gets dark and lights are on, you can be in trouble."</p>
      <p>Players from both sides spoke about the challenge of batting under lights and Kohli felt at times, the atmosphere at the heaving Eden Gardens resembled that of a Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 match.</p>
      <p>"Under lights, it was a different experience. The first time when I walked out, it felt like an IPL game atmosphere," he said.</p>
      <p>"So you feel like smashing the first ball but then you have to remind yourself that you have to play compact."</p>
