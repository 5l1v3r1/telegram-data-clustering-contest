      <h4>Damisi Ojo, Akure</h4>
      <p>The family of Sahara Reporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore at the weekend urged the Department of State Security Service (DSS) to release their son without further delay.</p>
      <p>Sowore was arrested on August 3 by the DSS over alleged treasonable felony for organising a Revolution Now project.</p>
      <p>However, after some months in detention, he was granted bail after meeting the stringent conditions, but still in DSS’s custody.</p>

      <p>A statement made available to <i>The Nation</i> and signed by Olusegun Sowore and Robert Sowore unequivocally maintained that their son believed in one Nigeria and has passion for the peaceful co-existence of citizenry.</p>
      <p>It stressed that he would in no way want to destabilise a democratically elected government.</p>
      <p>The family said “The continued incarceration of Omoyele in the DSS custody, even after the Court has given directive for his release give us cause for concern.</p>
      <p>“The attitude does not portray the government in a good light in the face of the citizens and of international observers.</p>
      <p>“The family is particularly worried about the DSS disregard for the rule of law.</p>
      <p>“We envisage that the DSS men in their characteristic manner would deliberately want to incarcerate him for no just cause even after meeting with the stringent bail conditions slammed on him by the judge.</p>
      <p>The Sowores urged well-meaning Nigerian, the human rights organisation,President Muhammadu Buhari, governors and legislators to urgently intervene in the matter.</p>
