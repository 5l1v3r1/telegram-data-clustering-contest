      <p>Outraged Strictly Come Dancing fans want a complete results overhaul after this weekend's dance-off storm.</p>
      <p>YouTube sensation Saffron Barker and pro partner AJ Pritchard were eliminated from the competition - but their exit was marred in controversy.</p>
      <p>CBBC star Karim Zeroual and his partner Amy Dowden found themselves in the dreaded dance-off despite finishing joint top of Saturday night's leaderboard.</p>
      <p>They received 6 points in the results scoring system for finishing top, which was only three more than the bottom placed couples, due to two sets of pairs having tied scores.</p>
      <p>Furious Strictly viewers want the system of deciding who is in the dance-off to change after the controversial outcome.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one viewer said: "So how will the weird way points are awarded when couples are tied influence the overall scores tonight? Being in 3rd place, Chris should only have 4 pts and someone at the bottom shouldn't have 3 points!! Could have quite an impact when combined with viewers scores"</p>
      <p>Pointing out the small gap in the scores, another added: "All between 3 and 6 points...."</p>
      <p>A third asked: "Explain the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> voting system. If it's spilt 50/50 judges and public, how can those top of judges leaderboard finish less than half way?"</p>

      <p>On leaving the show, Saffron said: "I’ve had the absolute time of my life and it’s all down to him. It’s been amazing.</p>
      <p>"I’d like to thank AJ so much, when I look at what I was like on week one I was so embarrassed and shy. He’s really taken me out of my shell. Thank you so much for everything."</p>
      <p>Pro dancer AJ added: " Every single week you’ve approached it with a positive mental attitude and you’ve inspired so many… on your own social media too.</p>
      <p>"As a non-dancer starting from day one I’m not going to lie I was a bit scared… but performing those fantastic dances has been amazing. I’ll never ever ever forget that dance. Thank you. The best partner. Thank you."</p>

      <p>A source told the Mirror: "Amy was utterly devastated that they were in the dance-off. Karim had to reassure her and was rubbing her back while they were waiting to perform.</p>
      <p>"After they were voted through and the cameras were off them, Amy burst into tears and was comforted by fellow pro dancer Neil Jones, who kept telling her 'It's not your fault'.She seemed to be blaming herself a lot for the situation they were in."</p>

      <p>The source added: "A lot of the celebs and pros looked very shocked that Karim and Amy were in the bottom two.</p>
      <p>"Chris and Alex, in particular, looked very worried and upset as they watched them in the dance-off from the balcony. Oti also shouted out her support and Neil mouthed 'wow' to Karim afterwards."</p>
