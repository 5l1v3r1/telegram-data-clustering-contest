      <p>The Conservative manifesto is the ‘same old same old’ and will not stop people ‘dying on the streets’ because of austerity, Jeremy Corbyn has claimed.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said the ‘brutality’ of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/universal-credit/">Universal Credit</a> system was placing ‘truly horrific’ stress on vulnerable people, as he launched a new scheme for a ‘cultural renaissance’ in London this evening.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive interview with Metro.co.uk, on the day that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/boris-johnson-vows-corbyn-neutral-christmas-tory-manifesto-speech-11209742/">Tories unveiled their General Election manifesto</a>, Mr Corbyn heavily criticised the governing party’s record on poverty.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Homelessness and rough sleeping is increasing – [it is] very hard to put an exact figure on it but Shelter and Crisis will both give you estimates which run into many thousands more than the so-called official count that there is and you come across all the time people dying on the streets of this country.</p>

      <p>‘We are not a poor country, that should simply not happen.’</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn continued: ‘There is also, sadly, the number of people taking their own lives when they have been on Universal Credit, or have been told to undertake a capability for work assessment test, been told they are fit for work when they are clearly are not, appeal it and it takes a very long time to appeal it and during that period are taking their own lives.</p>
      <p>‘It is truly horrific the stress that many people, particularly those with mental health conditions, are put under, by the brutality of the Universal Credit system.’</p>
      <p>In September, Mr Corbyn tweeted a video in which the journalist Ash Sarkar said 120,000 people have died as a result of austerity, based on an academic paper. However, Full Fact have suggested the claim needs to be treated with a <a href="https://fullfact.org/health/austerity-120000-unnecessary-deaths/">‘bit of caution’</a>.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn – who has promised to make dramatic changes to the welfare system as part of his own <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/much-will-labour-manifesto-actually-cost-11193972/">£83 billion plan for Britain</a> – added: ‘The spending commitments that the Prime Minister has made since July don’t even match up to the cuts made since 2010.</p>

      <p>‘The austerity programme has led to massive injustice and inequalities in this country. It is only our manifesto which is serious.’</p>
      <p>Labelling his plans for welfare ‘transformative’, he said Universal Credit needed to be scrapped and replaced with ‘social security’, adding that a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/22/governments-drastic-cuts-amount-human-rights-violation-un-says-9646201/">United Nations report</a> had suggested the ‘principle of a welfare state has been replaced by a cold and uncaring ethos’ in Britain.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader was speaking at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, where he pledged a new £1 billion arts charter backed by celebrities including Emeli Sandé, Mark Rylance, Lily Allen, MIA, Clean Bandit and Ken Loach.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn says he will put support for the arts at ‘the heart of Government’ in a cultural strategy dubbed ‘Arts for All’.</p>

      <p>The programme aims to radically expand access and funding for the arts, by upgrading and building new libraries, museums, galleries and arts venues nationwide.</p>
      <p>A further £175 million would be invested each year in an arts pupil premium, alongside a pledge to give every child the opportunity to learn a musical instrument.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: ‘The arts are a common inheritance that make our society culturally richer and put a smile on all our faces.</p>
      <p>‘Proper funding for the arts will be central to Labour’s commitment in Government to enable people to lead more enjoyable and fulfilling lives’.</p>

      <p>Labour would also launch a new ‘Town of Culture’ competition, invest a separate £1 billion in youth services and maintain free access to national museums and galleries.</p>

      <p>Funding for libraries, museums and art galleries across England has been cut by at least £640 million since 2010, according to the House of Commons Library.</p>
      <p>Responding to Mr Corbyn’s comments on homelessness, a Conservative spokesman said they were introducing an additional stamp duty surcharge on people buying UK properties from abroad, to fund programme to tackle rough sleeping.</p>
      <p>Adding that Boris Johnson’s party had already outlined £100 million of targeted support, the spokesman continued: ‘Universal Credit has helped people abandoned to a lifetime on benefits by Labour back into work, with long-term unemployment halving over the last five years.</p>
      <p>‘The government spends £90billion on benefits and because of our careful management of the economy, we are able to end the benefits freeze next year.</p>
      <p>‘Corbyn would wreck our economy and like every Labour government before him, leave more people out of work.’</p>
