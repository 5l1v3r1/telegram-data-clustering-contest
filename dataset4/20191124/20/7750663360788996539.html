      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/club-brugge/"><b>Club Brugge</b></a> make the trip to Turkey to take on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/galatasaray/"><b>Galatasaray</b></a> knowing that they require three points to maintain their slim hopes of qualifying for the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> knockout stages.</h2>

      <p>Meanwhile, while they cannot reach the last 16 of this competition, the home side are aware that victory on Tuesday night will put them on the brink of sealing a place in the Europa League after Christmas.</p>

      <p>Club Brugge require an unlikely set of results in order to progress through to the latter stages of this competition for the first time in their history, but that will not stop <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/philippe-clement/"><b>Philippe Clement</b></a>'s side from believing that they can achieve their goal.</p>
      <p>Victory for the Belgians on Tuesday evening, coupled with a defeat for Real Madrid against Paris Saint-Germain, would leave Brugge needing to beat the Spanish giants in front of their own fans on Matchday Six.</p>
      <p>Having already earned a 2-2 draw at the Bernabeu, Clement and his players know that they are capable of causing a monumental surprise, but they will still be wary of ensuring that they do not let slip of third spot in the group.</p>
      <p>If Brugge can secure a draw in Istanbul, it would leave Galatasaray needing to defeat PSG in Paris next month, something which appears unlikely given their capitulation against Real on away territory.</p>
      <p>On the domestic front, Brugge sit six points clear at the top of the standings, although Friday's 2-0 win over KV Oostende came on the back of a disappointing setback at Antwerp before the international break.</p>
      <p>As for Galatasaray, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fatih-terim/"><b>Fatih Terim</b></a> will be hoping that three points on Tuesday evening can act as a catalyst for an improved run of form in all competitions.</p>
      <p>While their failings in Europe have been well documented, losing 1-0 at home to Istanbul Basaksehir has left Gala down in seventh place in Turkey's top flight.</p>
      <p>After Fatih was able to put together a strong squad during the summer, their below-par performances have surprised many, but overcoming Brugge could lead to everything getting back on track ahead of the second half of the campaign.</p>

      <p>Tehim will have to make do without <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steven-nzonzi/"><b>Steven N'Zonzi</b></a> after the midfielder picked up his third yellow card in the defeat at Madrid.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jean-michael-seri/"><b>Jean Michael Seri</b></a> could be brought back into the team after remaining as an unused substitute in Galatasaray's last fixture.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/younes-belhanda/"><b>Younes Belhanda</b></a> is also pushing for a starting role, with Tehim potentially switching to a more attack-minded formation.</p>
      <p>Having being used as a second-half substitute against Oostende, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/emmanuel-dennis/"><b>Emmanuel Dennis</b></a> should return to the starting XI on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/percy-tau/"><b>Percy Tau</b></a> could also be involved after getting on the scoresheet earlier in the campaign.</p>
      <p><b>Galatasaray possible starting lineup:</b> Kocuk; Donk, Calik, Teixeira; Mariano, Feghouli, Lemina, Bayram, Tasdemir; Buyuk, Babel</p>
      <p><b>Club Brugge possible starting lineup:</b> Mignolet; Mata, Mechele, Deli, Sobol; Vormer, Rits, Vanaken; Tau, Dennis, Okereke</p>

      <h3>We say: Galatasaray 2-1 Club Brugge</h3>
      <p>Despite failing to score a single goal in 360 minutes of European football, we feel that Galatasaray will produce the goods in front of their own supporters on Tuesday. While Club Brugge will be more than satisfied with a share of the spoils, being prepared to settle for a point may not play into their favour.</p>
