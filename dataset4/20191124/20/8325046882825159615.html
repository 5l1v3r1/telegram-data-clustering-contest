      <p>Five teenagers were arrested and seven police officers injured after a brawl involving machetes erupted at a movie theater in Birmingham, England Saturday night, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/24/police-attacked-during-machete-brawl-at-birmingham-cinema">the Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>The fight occurred at the Star City leisure complex in Birmingham. Those arrested ranged from 13 years old to 19 years old. Four of them were arrested for assaulting police while another was arrested for obstructing police. Police recovered two machetes and a knife after the brawl dissippated, according to the Guardian.</p>
      <p>“It’s always hard to gauge these sorts of things, but what I will say is incidents like last night are rare,” Steve Graham, commander of Birmingham West neighbourhood policing unit, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-50536472">said</a>. “As for some officers who were there last night, it may be the worst thing they have ever seen.”</p>
      <p>The movie “Blue Story,” which was released this weekend in the UK and is about a London gang war, has been pulled from nearly 100 theaters throughout the UK.</p>
      <p>“We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film,” Vue Cinemas, which owns the venue where the fight took place and is the third-largest theater chain in the UK , said in a statement on Sunday. “The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority.”</p>
      <p>“Blue Story” director Andrew Onwubolu said in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/24/police-attacked-during-machete-brawl-at-birmingham-cinema">a statement</a>, “It’s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.”</p>
      <p>Rachael Allison, who witnessed the event, <a href="https://twitter.com/_rachaelallison/status/1198318482842148865">tweeted a video</a> of the altercation. She said she was at the theater to see “Blue Story” and in line for snacks when the fight broke out.</p>
      <p>“Worst thing is, it’s young girls fighting,” Allison tweeted. “Police brought batons, tasers, and dogs out. Star City now closed.”</p>
      <p>Allison <a href="https://twitter.com/bbc5live/status/1198515219393155073">told BBC Radio 5 Live</a> on Sunday that there were many families and children there during the fight to see “Frozen 2.”</p>
      <p>“A little boy was on the floor crying to his mom and a policeman was trying to console him,” Allison said. “It was just all so sad.”</p>
