      <p><b>CELINA, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Immigrants from the Marshall Islands who've settled over the years in a rural Ohio area are sharing their culture and history with their neighbors.</p>
      <p>The Marshallese Culture Club plans to meet once a week in Celina, where an estimated 1,500 people from the chain of south Pacific Ocean islands now live.</p>
      <p>The leader of the club tells The Daily Standard in Celina that those taking part will learn the language, customs and traditions of the Marshallese.</p>
      <p>Carmichael Capelle says he wants to teach the history of the Marshall Islands to the longtime residents of western Ohio and to the Marshallese community in Mercer County, including the children who don't know their history or language.</p>
      <p>He says that someday he'd like to have a Marshallese class taught in the area schools.</p>
