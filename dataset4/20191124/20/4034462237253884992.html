      <h1>2020 Lincoln Corsair Wins A Major Award</h1>
      <h2>The capable Corsair is a safe bet.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:40:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:40</time> by <a rel="author">Karl Furlong</a></address>
      <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety doesn't give out Top Safety Pick awards lightly, with only the very safest vehicles - and sometimes, only those specified with the right equipment - earning this distinction. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lincoln/corsair">2020 Lincoln Corsair</a> SUV has now achieved this honor for its vehicle-to-vehicle front crash prevention ability. Both the Corsair's standard and optional safety systems were highly rated. According to the IIHS, the closely related Ford Escape achieved identical ratings to the Corsair.</p>

      <p>In order to qualify for a current Top Safety Pick award, the relevant vehicle will have to achieve Good ratings in several crash parameters: the driver-side small overlap front, the moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and the effectiveness of the head restraints. In addition, Good or Acceptable ratings must be earned in the passenger-side small overlap front test, along with an Advanced or Superior rating for vehicle-to-vehicle front crash prevention and a headlight rating of Good or Acceptable.</p>

      <p>The Corsair's available safety equipment includes curve-adaptive LED projector headlights. There's also a camera-based dynamic bending lighting system whereby a camera at the front of the SUV can predict where light is needed if a corner is being approached, allowing the headlamps to immediately adjust. Speed-dependent lighting, meanwhile, changes the intensity of the beam depending on vehicle speed - higher speeds will illuminate more of the road ahead, and lower speeds will see the illumination of areas immediately around the Corsair.</p>

      <p>It all bodes well for the 2020 Lincoln Corsair as it takes the fight to premium-badged competition like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/x3">BMW X3</a>, itself a Top Safety Pick+ for superior crash safety. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc">Mercedes-Benz GLC </a>is another luxury SUV with a strong safety record. While the upscale and comfortable Lincoln is by no means the default offering in this segment, its superb safety results display Lincoln's commitment to compete with the best but at a more palatable price.</p>
