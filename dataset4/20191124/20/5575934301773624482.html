      <p>A former member of a hacker group responsible for taking over notable social media profiles has been arrested, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzawx/authorities-arrest-suspected-jack-dorsey-hacker">Motherboard reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The alleged member was involved with the “Chuckling Squad,” a group of hackers, and their takeover of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s account that resulted in offensive posts that included <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-account-hacked-n-word-hitler-innocent-2019-8">racial slurs, bomb threats, and anti-Semitism</a>. One of the leaders of the group, who goes by the handle Debug, told Motherboard that the member was arrested approximately two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>“He was a member of Chuckling Squad but not anymore. He was an active member for us by providing celebs/public figure [phone] numbers and helped us hack them,” Debug told the site, adding that the group kicked out the unnamed member in October.</p>
      <p>The Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office told Motherboard that several law enforcement agencies were involved in the arrest, including the department’s Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-hack-sim-swapping-how-2019-8/commerce-on-business-insider">The group largely uses SIM swapping</a>, a technique that hackers employ which involves convincing mobile phone companies to transfer a victim’s phone number to a SIM card that the hacker controls, which they can use to access accounts and reset passwords.</p>
      <p>Several accounts belonging to YouTube celebrities, <a href="https://www.insider.com/james-charles-youtubers-been-hacked-twitter-att-keemstar-hacking-chuckling-2019-8">including beauty vlogger James Charles</a>, Shane Dawson, and King Bach have fallen victim to the technique.</p>
      <p>Authorities have zeroed in on the technique, which has been identified as responsible for hackers accessing high-profile accounts in addition to triggering SWAT threats and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/">stealing cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/">Wired previously reported that smartphone users</a> can protect themselves from SIM swapping by adding a passcode to their carrier account or using a third-party app – such as Google Authenticator and Authy- for two-factor authentication.</p>
