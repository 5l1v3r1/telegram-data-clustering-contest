      <p>Ciara and Megan Thee Stallion recently had an epic dance session to remind us mere mortals that twerking is a way of life. On Friday, the 34-year-old singer and the 24-year-old rapper shared videos of them getting down (literally) to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/ciara-melanin-song-46934674">Ciara's new single, "Melanin."</a> Both women rocked gorgeous ensembles with high heels as they dropped it low and twerked perfectly to the beat. "Linked up with my Melanin Queen," Ciara captioned her Instagram post. Megan <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5MY3rWFShK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">gave a shout-out to CiCi</a> in the clip she posted, writing, "Team long legs."</p>
      <p>You can watch this video a million times, but their rhythm and balance will always be mind-blowing. My only question is, what are their knees made of? <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Who-Has-Valyrian-Steel-Sword-Game-Thrones-43844516">Valyrian steel</a>? <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/What-Vibranium-44593463">Vibranium, perhaps</a>? The willpower I wish I had? I need answers! But for now, I'll just enjoy this masterful dance sequence.</p>
