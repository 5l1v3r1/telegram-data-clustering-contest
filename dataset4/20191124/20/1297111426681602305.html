      <h1>New Moose Jaw cafe gives adults with disabilities a place to work</h1>
      <h2>"Just the smiles on their faces and the excitement when we say, 'OK it's time to go to the cafe now and start getting ready for the day.'"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:38:48+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>Every year when the staff at Moose Jaw Families For Change (MJFFC) sit down with their clients with disabilities to ask them about their goals, a similar theme pops up: They want to get a job.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately for the people that we serve, sometimes seeking employment can be very hard for them,” said Katie Statler, community coordinator for MJFFC. MJFFC is a local non-profit organization that works with adults with disabilities in both residential and community settings.</p>
      <p>“With that knowledge, we decided that we could do something to try and create these jobs.”</p>
      <p>The staff began thinking of what they could do and, with the majority of their clients expressing interest in the food service industry, the idea of opening a cafe quickly came to mind. Although the idea was only born this summer, the project came together faster than expected.</p>
      <p>“We all decided, you know what, this is something that we need, that the community needs, and we just went ahead,” said Statler.</p>
      <p>After a successful week of training their clients on the various roles and a soft opening, the Kinsmen Cafe is ready for its grand opening on Monday.</p>
      <p>Jordan Nanan, a client of the MJFFC, will be one of the people working at the cafe.</p>
      <p>In the last week of training, he has learned to do a number of new tasks at the cafe: “Serving them breakfast and lunch, and I do coffee and water, take orders,” he said.</p>
      <p>This is Nanan’s first job and he said he is excited to get started. Through the provided job training, he said he has learned how to take people’s orders and about health and safety in the kitchen. He will be working at the cafe two days a week.</p>
      <p>“It’s good. I’m liking it … It gives me something to do,” he said.</p>

      <p>Many of the MJFFC’s clients have never had a job before, and Statler said giving them an opportunity to learn responsibility and job skills will help them move on to other jobs in the future. She said there are no words to describe the overwhelmingly positive response she has seen from clients in the last week as they learn about their new roles.</p>
      <p>“Just the smiles on their faces and the excitement when we say, ‘OK it’s time to go to the cafe now and start getting ready for the day.’ I think that they would feel a sense of appreciation, a sense of inclusion, a sense of growth,” she said.</p>
      <p>Having the opportunity to interact with and contribute to the community also gives the workers a stronger sense of inclusion and belonging, said Statler, which is one of the goals MJFFC has for each of its clients.</p>
      <p>There are only a handful of MJFFC clients working at the cafe to begin with, but Statler hopes to see that number grow as the business becomes more established.</p>
      <p>The Kinsmen Cafe is located at 431 4th Avenue SW in Moose Jaw and, starting Monday, will be open seven days a week from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The menu includes several breakfast and lunch options, along with coffee and snacks.</p>
