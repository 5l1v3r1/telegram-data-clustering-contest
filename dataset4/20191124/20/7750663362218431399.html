      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/"><b>Bayern Munich</b></a> make the trip to Serbia to take on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/red-star-belgrade/"><b>Red Star Belgrade</b></a> having already qualified for the last 16 of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The German giants realistically require one point to seal top spot in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/">Group B</a>, while hosts Red Star know that avoiding defeat on Tuesday evening will put them in a strong position to seal a place in the Europa League.</p>

      <p>Despite an increasingly amount of highly-regarded managers being available to replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nico-kovac/"><b>Nico Kovac</b></a> in the Bayern dugout, it appears likely that the Croatian's assistant <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hansi-flick/"><b>Hansi Flick</b></a> will be provided with an extended period in a more senior role.</p>
      <p>Since his interim appointment, Bayern have recorded three successive victories, with 10 goals and three clean sheets coming against Olympiacos, Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna Dusseldorf respectively.</p>
      <p>The 4-0 success over Dortmund would have provided the club's hierarchy with every encouragement to show faith in Flick for the foreseeable future as they look to reclaim top spot in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Thrashing Dusselforf at the weekend has put Bayern to within one point of leaders Borussia Monchengladbach, and Flick will want to continue their winning run ahead of facing the frontrunners on December 7.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-lewandowski/"><b>Robert Lewandowski</b></a>'s four-match scoring streak came to an end on Saturday, the Poland international has still been far away the star performer for Bayern this season with 22 goals in Germany's top flight and Europe.</p>
      <p>Red Star welcome Bayern holding a seven-point lead in their domestic standings, with their last defeat against Serbian opposition coming back on September 22.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vladan-milojevic/"><b>Vladan Milojevic</b></a> has witnessed his side be thoroughly outclassed against their next opponents and Tottenham Hotspur, realistically leaving them to focus on trying to earn third spot ahead of Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>Providing that Spurs can avoid defeat against the Greek side in London, Red Star know that the outcome of their meeting with Bayern is effectively irrelevant.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, being able to compete with their more illustrious opponents would provide Milojevic and his squad with the belief they may require to gain a positive result against Olympiacos on away territory.</p>

      <p>Despite being in full control of the group, Flick is likely to name a strong starting lineup for this game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kingsley-coman/"><b>Kingsley Coman</b></a> will hope to get the nod over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ivan-perisic/"><b>Ivan Perisic</b></a> on the left flank, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alphonso-davies/"><b>Alphonso Davies</b></a> should continue to deputise at left-back in place of the injured <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-hernandez/"><b>Lucas Hernandez</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niklas-sule/"><b>Niklas Sule</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jann-fiete-arp/"><b>Jann-Fiete Arp</b></a> also remain on the sidelines, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jerome-boateng/"><b>Jerome Boateng</b></a> is available after serving a domestic suspension.</p>
      <p>As for Red Star, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/branko-jovicic/"><b>Branko Jovicic</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/milan-pavkov/"><b>Milan Pavkov</b></a> are both absent for the home side through injury.</p>
      <p>Tomane should deputise in attack, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-canas/"><b>Jose Canas</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marko-marin/"><b>Marko Marin</b></a> - formerly of Swansea City and Chelsea respectively - are expected to feature in the starting lineup.</p>
      <p><b>Red Star Belgrade possible starting lineup:</b> Borjan; Gobeljic, Milunovic, Degenek, Rodic; Canas, Jovancic; Garcia, Marin, Parra; Tomane</p>
      <p><b>Bayern Munich possible starting lineup:</b> Neuer; Pavard, Martinez, Alaba, Davies; Muller, Kimmich, Goretzka; Gnabry, Lewandowski, Coman</p>

      <h3>We say: Red Star Belgrade 0-4 Bayern Munich</h3>
      <p>Based on the recent performances of each team, we cannot see anything other than a convincing win for the visitors. Red Star showed nothing against Spurs to suggest that they can get anywhere near to causing an upset on Tuesday, and success for the hosts may be avoiding a heavy defeat.</p>
