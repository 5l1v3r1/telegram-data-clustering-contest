      <h2>Fans took to Twitter as they went into meltdown over the judge's bold new look during this evening's results show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:14:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> fans have been sent into overdrive by judge Motsi Mabuse's bold fashion choice.</p>
      <p>As the judges came out for tonight's results show, fans flocked to social media with confused posts about her quirky ensemble.</p>
      <p>"Has Motsi forgotten to put her skirt on? #Bodyshaper #Strictly," one penned.</p>
      <p>Another laughed: "So @MOTSI_MABUSE is wearing velvet cycling shorts and I'm here for it #Strictly."</p>
      <p>A third wondered if Motsi had been taking fashion heads ups from co-host Tess Daly.</p>
      <p>"Has Motsi been raiding Tess' wardrobe? #onesleeve #strictly," they asked.</p>
      <p>A fourth was just as baffled, but insisted Motsi was the one to make it work.</p>

      <p>"@MOTSI_MABUSE looking all kinds of fabulous," another wrote, "An outfit that really not many people could pull off #strictly."</p>
      <p>Aside from Motsi's outfit, the show also saw Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard sent packing after being eliminated during their second dance off in a row.</p>
      <p>They went up against expected finalists Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, particularly shocking to fans considering they were joined top of yesterday's leaderboard alongside Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse.</p>

      <p>Craig, Motsi and Bruno all voted to keep Karim and axe Saffron, with head honcho Shirley admitting she would have voted the same way.</p>
      <p>"I've had the absolute time of my life," Saffron told Tess of AJ, "And it's all down to him. It's been amazing.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank AJ so much, when I look at what I was like on Week One, I was so embarrassed and shy.</p>
      <p>"He's really taken me out of my shell. Thank you so much for everything."</p>
      <p>AJ had kinds words of his own, gushing: "Every single week you've approached it with a positive mental attitude and you've inspired so many...on your own social media too.</p>
      <p>"As a non-dancer starting from Day One I'm not going to lie, I was a bit scared...but performing those fantastic dances has been amazing.</p>
      <p>"And that Waltz...I'll never ever ever forget that dance. Thank you. The best partner. Thank you."</p>
