      <p>Jose Mourinho got off to a winning start on his Premier League return with Tottenham against West Ham at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Liverpool took another step towards the title with a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace, which leaves them eight points clear at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Manchester City brought Chelsea’s six-match winning run in the Premier League to an end with a 2-1 win over the Blues as they moved up to third place.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a look at five things we learned from this weekend’s action</p>

      <p>Another week of VAR controversy ensued as Crystal Palace had their opening goal against Liverpool ruled out because of a foul by Jordan Ayew in the build-up as Liverpool went on to win 2-1. Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling thought he had added a late third for his side in a 2-1 win over Chelsea, but his injury-time effort was ruled out for offside in a very tight VAR call, with the player taking to twitter to take out his frustration at the number of overruled goals he had been subject to this season.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool leave it late again</h3>

      <p>Chris Wilder’s newly-promoted side have impressed already this season and went into the game ahead of Manchester United in the table. The Blades were on course for victory following goals from John Fleck and Lys Mousset. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side struggled to get going at Bramall Lane before three goals in seven minutes put them ahead. The home side dug deep, with Oli McBurnie coming off the bench to secure a draw.</p>
