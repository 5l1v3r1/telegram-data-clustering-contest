      <p>A SPECIAL meeting was held at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Sunday to review and re-orient rice and maize improvement programmes for better paddy straw management, crop diversification and water conservation. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Vice-Chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon and was attended by several experts.</p>
      <p>An official release from the varsity said, “It was decided that the rice breeding programme will stop working on varieties of long duration, and focus on medium maturity duration varieties like PR 121 which takes 110 days to mature (post-transplanting). Seed production of PR-122 (which takes 117 days to mature) will be stopped from 2020. Emphasis would be increased on breeding varieties suitable for direct seeding (DSR). Here too short duration varieties will be preferred.”</p>
      <p>The statement further said: “In view of spread of Basmati cultivation from traditional zone to new areas, where manual harvesting is not practised, it was decided to promote cultivation of shorter duration PUSA Basmati 1509 rather than long duration PUSA Basmati 1121. PAU is in the process of developing new strains of Basmati which are one week earlier in maturity than PUSA Basmati 1121. These are at final stage of testing and if found suitable, multiplication and release will be accelerated. PAU would also actively pursue the de-registeration of PUSA 44, the longest duration variety (130 days, post transplanting).”</p>
      <p>The scientists said diversification from rice is urgently required and the meeting demarcated steps to strengthen the most important alternative — maize.</p>
      <p>“The maize breeding work at PAU was sought to be strengthened by provision of two additional posts (maize breeding) for strengthening research on long duration hybrids and speciality (pop, sweet, baby, waxy, high oil) maize and one post for research on precision agronomy at main campus at Ludhiana by diverting positions from other crops. The maize research team would also associate scientists from farm engineering departments to provide improved farm mechanisation and processing technologies. Likewise one scientist each at Regional Research Stations at Gurdaspur and Ballowal Saunkhri will be associated with maize as their priority area of research. It was also decided to send scientists to advance institutes such as CIMMYT, Mexico, for training on accelerated inbred line development and identification of material with potential for high yield under Punjab conditions,” said the statement.</p>
      <p>At the meeting, it was decided that they work with farmers for implementation of improved package of maize cultivation practices aimed at narrowing the gap in economic returns vis-à-vis rice. Interventions would include quality seeds and precise sowing, effective and integrated nutrient and pest management to ensure higher yield.</p>
