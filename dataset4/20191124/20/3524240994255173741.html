      <h1>Union enjoying reputation as Bundesliga giant-killers</h1>

      <p>Goal-scorers Anthony Ujah and Sebastian Andersson say mid-table FC Union are happy forging a reputation as Bundesliga giant-killers after adding Borussia Moenchengladbach to their growing list of big name victims.</p>
      <p>Having already stunned Borussia Dortmund and Freiburg at their Alten Foersterei stadium in only their first season in Germany’s top flight, Union also shocked Gladbach 2-0 on Saturday in Berlin.</p>
      <p>It is the second time this season Union have beaten the Bundesliga’s leading side after also pulling off a 3-1 win in late August over Dortmund, who then topped the table.</p>
      <p>“I think so now, we have showed the big teams that we can win here,” said Andersson Swedish forward.</p>
      <p>“We’re in a good mood, we won’t think too much about it, but we want to keep it going.”</p>
      <p>Nigeria striker Ujah gave the hosts the lead in the 15th minutes with a well-taken header before Andersson also headed home deep into added time to give Union a fourth straight win.</p>
      <p>Between them, Andersson and Ujah now have eight league goals this season.</p>
      <p>Ujah agreed that Union are making a habit of raising their game at home, but warned that beating Gladbach will count for nothing when they travel to fourth-placed Schalke on Friday.</p>
      <p>“We’re playing well and we want to make it hard for any opponent to beat us here,” said the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>“It feels good and we want to keep it going as long as possible, but we are just looking at each game as it comes.”</p>
      <p>After their away game in Gelsenkirchen, mid-table Union face two teams in the bottom three when they host Cologne before facing Paderborn away.</p>
      <p>“We are really happy with 16 points after 12 games and we’ve beaten the leaders, but it doesn’t mean it will be any easier to beat Cologne or Paderborn,” warned Ujah.</p>
