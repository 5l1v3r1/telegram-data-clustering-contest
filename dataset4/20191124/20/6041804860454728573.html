      <p>No luck seems to be shining on comedian Sunil recently after he came back to the usual comedian roles. None of his come back roles was well-written and therefore, he turned out to be a failure comedian, now.</p>
      <p>He actually enjoyed a golden phase as a popular comedian with a peculiar body language and his style of dialogue delivery. After he turned hero, <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/highly-irresponsible-media-kills-comedian-sunil/">Sunil</a> kind of lost that subtlety he used to show with his mannerisms and facial expressions.</p>
      <p>Hero characters did him no good and made him lose what he had as a famous comedian who ruled the Telugu Industry with back-to-back offers. Only an author-backed comic role can do the miracle for him to be hit back with a bang.</p>
      <p>Letâ€™s wait and see if there is something coming that would resurrect his come back career as a comedian. People say that he has been waiting for offers, and we hope that he would be picked up for a character that can bring him back into the limelight.</p>
