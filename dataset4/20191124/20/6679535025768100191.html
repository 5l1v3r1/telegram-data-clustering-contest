      <h1>MMRDA plans single application for all transport services in city</h1>
      <h2>‘Model adopted by Helsinki-based Whim app ideal’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:42:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ajeet-Mahale-13598/" target="_blank">Ajeet Mahale</a></address>
      <p>The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning to develop a mobile application that will serve as a single platform for all transport services in the city.</p>
      <p>The app will dispel the need to have several mobile applications for different services such as app-based taxi aggregators, railways, Metro and public bus services in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.</p>
      <p>R.A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said a study of all international models showed that the one adopted by the Helsinki-based Whim app was ideal for the city.</p>
      <p>“In a city where there are so many options, we need to provide a place where everyone can seamlessly and effortlessly access all modes of transport and not have to switch between different apps,” he said.</p>
      <p>Whim app, created by the Helsinki-based MaaS Global, was rolled out in 2016. It partners with city transport operators and allows its users to select any mode such as public transport, taxis, bikes and more.</p>
      <p>The concept of Whim app is ‘mobility as a service’, and it has gained popularity in the past few years in European countries.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajeev said in a city like Mumbai, with several transport operators, the app will need to be backed by a single authority such as the MMRDA.</p>
      <p>Senior officials said it is still in the conceptual stage and it will be at least one year before it can take shape. “The idea is to provide a platform where commuters can travel with one ticket and have the information such as expected time of arrival of trains, buses or cabs in one place,” a senior MMRDA official said.</p>
