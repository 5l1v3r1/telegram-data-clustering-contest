      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:53:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Lumley, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/">Bristol</a> family spanning five generations has held the biggest family <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> get together in the country.</p>
      <p>More than 100 members of the Cole family gather for the party every year to enjoy a range of festive activities with their many loved ones. </p>
      <p>The enormous party, held this year on Sunday (November 17) in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/shirehampton">Shirehampton</a> , saw a gathering of 120 family members from 82 to just six months old.</p>
      <p>Brenda Cotterell, 58, said the bash was arranged by her eldest sister Shirley.</p>
      <p>The two sisters said the get together was carrying on the tradition that their late father, Albert Cole, began 15 years ago.</p>

      <p>Brenda said: “My dad loved Christmas so, so much. You could feel his excitement building every year.</p>
      <p>“My father was always the big personality. His great-grandchildren still call him Grandad Lucky Dip, because he would dress up as Father Christmas and would always have a lucky dip to play with them.”</p>
      <p>"The Lucky Dip is something that the family have made sure to keep going in Albert's honour, as well as a raffle, with gifts and sweets donated by various family members.</p>
      <p>Brenda added: “My father started this gathering every year after losing his son Andrew, my youngest brother, aged 22, and then losing my mum 28 years ago.</p>

      <p>“As the family has grown, it gets quite hard to keep track of everyone, and know who is who.</p>
      <p>“But I know how much my father would love to see us all together today."</p>
      <p>Brenda's sister Shirley, who helped to organise this year's event, said: “It's brilliant to get everyone together.</p>
      <p>“It can be a nightmare trying to visit everyone during the year."</p>
      <p>Brenda's aunt Lin, who is married to Albert's brother Richard – one of four of Albert's surviving siblings – joked that not one person at the party knew everybody else there.</p>
      <p>The great-grandmother of three said: “It's just life, for us. My family have grown up not knowing any differently – this is just normal.</p>
      <p>“My daughter was talking to someone recently who only had two cousins, and she just couldn't believe it. She couldn't fathom them not having more cousins.</p>
      <p>“It's just nice to come to an event like this and not have to worry about keeping an eye on the little ones, or worry about them annoying others, because you know somebody in this hall will be watching them.”</p>
      <p>Brenda's uncle John, who has 32 great-grandkids of his own, added: "It's really good to all get together – but we won't get Christmas presents for everybody here."</p>
