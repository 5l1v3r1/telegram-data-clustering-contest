      <p>A MAN IN his 20s has been shot dead in north Dublin this evening.</p>
      <p>Gardaí and emergency services were called to Clonshaugh Avenue in Coolock following reports of a shooting at around 5.15pm.</p>
      <p>The victim was shot a number of times and was treated at the scene before being removed to Beaumont Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>The scene has been preserved for a forensic and technical examination. No arrests have been made, and gardaí are continuing their inquiries.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he was “deeply concerned” at the shooting, which he condemned as “wanton violence”. </p>
      <p>“I urge anyone with information to please contact An Garda Síochána and assist them with their investigation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil councillor Racheal Batten said that it was upsetting for the local community to have to deal with another shooting incident in the area.</p>
      <p>“The worst part of it is that it is not shocking, and there will be children walking to school tomorrow morning walking past garda tape and asking what happened,” she said.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the shooting is being asked to contact Coolock garda station on 01 666 4200 or the Garda confidential line on 1800 666 111.</p>
      <p>It is the second fatal shooting in the capital in the past week. On Monday, the body of Wayne Whelan <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/murder-arrest-mark-desmond-4899448-Nov2019/">was discovered</a> in a burning car at Mount Andrew Court in Lucan.</p>
      <p>Whelan is believed to have been involved in a number of ongoing feuds in Dublin.</p>
