        <b>Paternal. Sexless. Infinitely square. The cardigan sweater is generally considered the Mister Rogers of menswear, and for good reason: Fred Rogers made sure of it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the course of 895 episodes and 33 years of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” Mister Rogers advertised his gentle, nonthreatening nature by slipping from a jacket and tie — symbols of the messy, scary adult professional world — into a humble knit zip-up that was homely both in the British definition (“Simple but cozy and comfortable, as in one’s own home”) and the American (I mean, yikes).</p>
      <p>Mister Rogers’ many, colourful cardigans — one of which is now in the Smithsonian — were originally knitted by Rogers’ mother, Nancy McFeely Rogers. According to a recent article on Smithsonian.com, she made a new one for her famous son every Christmas (a McTouchy McFeely detail if there ever was one).</p>
      <p>After she died in 1981, the show’s art director looked to that bastion of saucy style, the US Postal Service, for inspiration, relying on hand-dyed versions of mail-carrier cardigans.</p>
      <p>Fashion, of course, was not the point. Mister Rogers’ talismanic cardigan, which is faithfully re-created by Yasemin Esmeck for the new film “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” starring Tom Hanks, was the sartorial equivalent of a lullaby — sweet, comforting, bland — and it helped lull generations of American preschoolers into the cosy Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where there are no bad people and no bad thoughts.</p>
      <p>This worked well for children but did no favours for the sweater itself, helping brand the cardigan — any cardigan — as doofuswear, the male equivalent of a chastity belt. (Likewise considered slightly sorority sister for women, it got a power boost after being worn by Michelle Obama for, among other occasions, drinks with the Queen of England.)</p>
      <p>It wasn’t all Mister Rogers’ fault. Unlike the standard form-fitting pullover, many midcentury male cardigans artfully hid the male physique inside a woolly tomb with the contours of a sleeping bag. Generally speaking, this was comfort clothing designed to steer men toward the den, not the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Lingering associations with sitcom dads (think Ward Cleaver) and lettermen sweaters of the Pat Boone 1950s (sis-boom-blah) only underscored the point: The cardigan was a buttoned-up sweater for a buttoned-up era. Would it ever recover?</p>
      <p>Lately, there are signs.</p>
      <p>Searches for men’s cardigans on Poshmark, a fashion resale site, spiked 79% since the Tom Hanks film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in early September, as Rachel Tashjian recently reported in GQ.</p>

      <p>Last month, the shabby-chic olive-green cardigan that Kurt Cobain wore for his famous “MTV Unplugged” performance in 1993 made headlines, selling at auction for $334,000, apparently a record for a sweater.</p>
      <p>With thrift-store origins, unkempt mohair fibres and early-1990s stains intact, the Cobain sweater is a fitting rebuttal to the Rogers cardigan. A symbol of shaggy punk nihilism, it is the knitwear equivalent of a power chord loud enough to scare the meow-meow out of Henrietta Pussycat.</p>
      <p>The bad-boy potential of the cardigan is also on full display in HBO’s “Succession,” in which Logan Roy, the dark-lord media mogul played by Brian Cox, has made the avuncular shawl cardigan the uniform for his weekly adventures in corporate mayhem and subterfuge.</p>
      <p>Outfitting an assassin of the C-suite in an item of apparel typically associated with doting grandfathers and white-haired Irish poets is a mordant costume choice, like slipping an M-80 firecracker into an Easter flower arrangement. Even so, it is hardly the first time anyone has attempted to infuse the cardigan with a little swagger.</p>
      <p>Steve McQueen occasionally rocked a cardigan in the 1960s. Then again, Steve McQueen could rock a scarlet Bozo the Clown wig.</p>
      <p>At the height of the disco era, Paul Michael Glaser of television’s “Starsky &amp; Hutch” injected the cardigan with a dose of street cred. Glaser’s Starsky looked extremely happening — or at least, extremely 1970s — in his trademark south-of-the-border shawl cardigan, which was, if nothing else, less risible than the cop duo’s red Ford Gran Torino with the faux-Nike white swoop.</p>
      <p>Sadly for Glaser, Jeff Bridges undid much of his hard work two decades later, with his Dude character in “The Big Lebowski” seizing on a similar sofa-throwish cardigan — also known as the Westerley cardigan, by Pendleton — as a signifier of sunbaked, aging-hipster dissolution. You could practically smell the bong water seeping through its fibres.</p>
      <p>In the years since, countless male celebrities have made game attempts to rescue the cardigan from Mister Rogers’ closet and make it safe for the red carpet: David Beckham, Pharrell Williams, Daniel Craig. As 007, Craig even managed to make a Tom Ford black shawl-collar cardigan look menacing in the 2008 James Bond film “Quantum of Solace.”</p>
      <p>The takeaway? The cardigan is as every bit as bad as you make it.</p>
