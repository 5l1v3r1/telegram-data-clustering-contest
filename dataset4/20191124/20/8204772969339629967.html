      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Roman+Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a> has rejected bidders who think they can buy <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Chelsea">Chelsea</a> at a “bargain” price, and remains just as involved in the club as he has ever been, the chairman <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Bruce+Buck">Bruce Buck</a> says.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Guardian about the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_event=Premier+League">Premier League</a> club’s current status and plans, Buck said the Chelsea owner had no plans to sell despite having apparently not been to a home match since the spring of 2018 when the British government delayed renewing his visa.</p>
      <p>Abramovich withdrew his UK visa application after the delay, which was widely understood to be part of the retaliation against <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Vladimir+Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> whom the British government directly blamed for the Novichok poisoning of former Russian spy <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sergei+Skripal">Sergei Skripal</a> and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Abramovich took Israeli citizenship in May 2018, and cancelled a new 60,000-seat, £1 billion stadium development long planned for Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>However, of suggestions that Abramovich may be planning to sell, Buck said: “So far as I know, absolutely not; to the contrary. I have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich ‘let’s get this ready for a sale’ or something.</p>
      <p>“Because of the political situation there are people who think they might want to buy Chelsea football club at a bargain. We do get inquiries, and we really have nothing to say to these people.</p>
      <p>“In terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players’ contracts, do we buy this player, do we sell this player, [Abramovich] was always intimately involved in that from day one, and is just as intimately involved now.</p>
      <p>“He talks to Marina [Granovskaia] – the board member who supervises the football operation – several times a day, every day. Marina has been doing that for seven or eight years; that hasn’t let up or changed at all.”</p>
      <p>Responding to the suggestion that the club appears to be on hold given Abramovich’s absence and the mothballed stadium plans, Buck said: “I understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say ‘let’s see what happens in the next transfer window.’</p>
      <p>“The point I am making – it’s a glib one – if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it’s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.”</p>
      <h3>Graduates</h3>
      <p>Buck acknowledged that the first-team opportunities <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Frank+Lampard">Frank Lampard</a> has given to the talented group of English graduates from Chelsea’s academy is partly due to the two-window ban, imposed for multiple breaches of the registration rules for under-18 players from overseas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mason+Mount">Mason Mount</a>, Callum Hudson-Odoi, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Fikayo+Tomori">Fikayo Tomori</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Tammy+Abraham">Tammy Abraham</a> all featured for <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=England">England</a> during this month’s internationals against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>“The transfer ban has led to more opportunities for the young players,” he said. “It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy. I would guess he’s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches.”</p>
