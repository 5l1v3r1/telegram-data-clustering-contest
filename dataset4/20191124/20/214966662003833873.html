      <p>Three men have been charged after a major drug bust in Broadbeach Waters last week.</p>
      <p>It’s understood police were tipped off to suspicious activity at a home on Rebecca Court, by a member of the public.</p>
      <p>Officers executed a search warrant on Friday morning – when they allegedly uncovered scores of dangerous drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and testosterone.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old, 29-year-old and a 47-year-old were all charged with various drug offences.</p>
      <p>The two men in their 20s will appear at Southport Magistrates Court next month while the 47-year-old man will appear in January.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Craig McGrath from Major and Organised Crime Squad encourages people who observe suspicious activities in their neighbourhood to contact Crimestoppers.</p>
      <p>“Information from the community assists greatly in identifying and disrupting these illegal activities,” Detective Inspector McGrath said.</p>
