        <b>Banco de Portugal will soon launch a public consultation on new rules that will force banks to tighten internal control, Governor Carlos Costa said on 22 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The announcement was made by the central bank governor at the Money Conference in Lisbon, stating that this is a new regulation that will repeal the 2008 notice, adapting the rules in the light of new European legislation at a time when major banks are required to improve internal governance, risk management, data collection, reporting and internal audit.</p>
      <p>According to the governor, banks that do not make improvements will have an effect on their capital requirements, that is, he said, "capital requirements reflect the shortcomings of governance."</p>
