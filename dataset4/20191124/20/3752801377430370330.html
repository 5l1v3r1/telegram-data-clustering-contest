      <p>At least 23 people were killed on Sunday when a small plane crashed into houses in a densely populated area of the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a regional rescue official said.</p>
      <p>The dead are believed to include all those on board the plane as well as people on the ground.</p>
      <p>"We are up to 23 bodies now," Goma rescue service coordinator Joseph Makundi told AFP as authorities work to recover bodies at the crash site.</p>
      <p>Images from the scene showed plumes of black smoke and flames apparently from the burning plane as locals looked on.</p>
      <p>Rescue workers were also seen combing through the plane's burned-out fuselage.</p>
      <p>Goma airport official Richard Mangolopa told AFP no survivors were expected from the disaster.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 aircraft had been headed for the city of Beni, 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma when it went down after take-off in a residential area near the airport in the east of the country.</p>
      <p>"There were 17 passengers on board and two crew members," Busy Bee airline staff member Heritier Said Mamadou said of the flight that took off around 0700 GMT.</p>
      <p>Busy Bee, a recently established company, has three planes serving routes in the North Kivu province.</p>
      <p>The pilot "failed to take-off," said Nord Kivu governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita in a statement.</p>
      <p>One of the company's maintenance workers at the site quoted by news site actualite.cd blamed a "technical problem".</p>
      <p>The precise number of casualties on the plane and on the ground was not yet known.</p>
      <p>The UN mission deployed in DR Congo, MONUSCO, sent two fire engines to support local rescue services.</p>
      <p>Aircraft accidents are common in the vast, conflict-wracked central African country, in particular involving Antonov planes.</p>
      <p>Last month an Antonov-72 cargo plane that was providing logistical assistance for a trip by Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and carrying eight crew and passengers went missing after taking off from Goma.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, an Antonov cargo plane chartered by the army crashed near the capital Kinshasa, killing all 12 people on board.</p>
      <p>The country's deadliest Antonov disaster was in January 1996 when an overloaded plane overshot the runway in Kinshasa and crashed into a popular market, killing hundreds on the ground.</p>

        <b>Troubled province</b>
      </p>
      <p>Goma is the capital of troubled North Kivu province.</p>
      <p>The plane's destination, Beni, has been the scene of other tragedies in the province plagued with fighting between rival militias. More than 60 civilians have been massacred since October 30.</p>
      <p>The failure of the army and police to stop the killings has prompted protests by civilians, the latest one on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Nord Kivu governor went to Beni to calm the citizens and on Sunday offered condolences to the families of the victims of the plane crash.</p>
      <p>Beni has also been at the epicentre of an Ebola epidemic which so far has killed around 2,200 people in DR Congo in the last year.</p>
