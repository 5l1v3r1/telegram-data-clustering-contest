      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Strong trade winds are still pushing in advisory-level surf for east-facing shores, but a high surf advisory for north and west shores has been canceled as a short-lived northwest swell declines slowly.</p>
      <p>The advisory remains in effect until 6 a.m. Monday for the east-facing shores of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui and the Big Island.</p>
      <p>East shore waves are forecast at 6 to 9 feet, with rough and choppy conditions.</p>
      <p>Beachgoers should expect strong breaking waves, along with strong longshore and rip currents that can make swimming difficult and dangerous. Use caution and heed all advice from ocean safety lifeguards.</p>
