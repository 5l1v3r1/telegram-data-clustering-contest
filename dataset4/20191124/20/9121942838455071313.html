      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Montrezl Harrell tied a career-high with 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 26 and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 134-109 Sunday night for their fifth straight win.</p>

      <p>JJ Redick and Holiday hit 3-pointers to give the Pelicans a 10-6 lead three minutes into the game before the Clippers took control with a 15-4 run. George keyed the run with a pair of 3s and Leonard added five.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles led 40-27 and then increased it to 62-37 on George’s 3 with 5:55 remaining in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Clippers went into halftime with a 72-56 advantage before New Orleans cut the lead in half with an 11-3 run to start the third quarter. Jaxson Hayes’ layup drew the Pelicans to 86-80 with 4:53 remaining in the quarter but that would be as close as they got as Los Angeles countered with an 11-2 run, which included Harrell scoring the last six points.</p>
