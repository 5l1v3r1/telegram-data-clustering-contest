      <h2>The horrific fight at Star City in Birmingham is said to have led to the huge riot which caused the Vue cinema to go into lockdown on a busy Saturday afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:00:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Zoe Chamberlain, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>Footage captures girls fighting at a Vue cinema which led to the huge riot that put the entertainment venue on lockdown last night.</p>
      <p>The new clip shows at least five teenage girls grabbing one helpless victim and appearing to lift her into the air.</p>
      <p>She then somersaults back onto her feet but is pushed to the ground and pulled along the floor by her hair.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/watch-shocking-footage-girls-fighting-17308802">Birmingham Live</a> reports this fracas escalated quickly and led to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-birmingham-star-city-incident-20945783">the mass brawl, said to involve around 100 youths</a> of both gender.</p>
      <p>Onlookers at Star City, a popular entertainment venue in Nechells, Birmingham, saw the first victim desperately try to defend herself and grab the ankles of the attackers.</p>

      <p>One witness told Mirror Online: "That's probably one of the scariest moments of my life. Me and my daughter were in a queue to watch frozen, loads of little kids there, all dressed up and everything, then these girls jumped on another girl and loads of these kids just started fighting.</p>
      <p>"Armed police came with Tasers. All the people that were fighting run off into the cinema. There's about 15 to 20 police cars. I'm shaking.</p>
      <p>"The police were very aggressive there was lots of little kids there.</p>
      <p>"My sister is 11 and they was pointing the Tasers in our face."</p>

      <p>Another witness said: "This is the most horrifying thing I’ve been involved in I’m scared and I’m 45 little girls dressed in frozen dresses crying and screaming appalling behaviour all over a gangster film set in London."</p>
      <p>Police say the violence got worse and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-birmingham-star-city-incident-20949094">five teenagers, including a girl of just 13, were arrested</a>.</p>
      <p>"I'm really aware that a lot of people were distressed by what they saw, but it's really important to stress that no members of the public were injured during this disorder," Birmingham West Neighbourhood Policing Unit, Steve Graham, said.</p>
      <p>"Incidents of this scale of disorder we saw last night are rare, not just at Star City but across the city and the broader West Midlands.</p>

      <p>"So if anyone is feeling unsafe I could understand in the immediate wake of that why they might do.</p>
      <p>"However, Star City is still safe place to go. Birmingham is still a safe place to go."</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police have, though, stepped up security and added extra police officers at the complex tonight. Seven of their officers were assaulted, but no members of the public were hurt.</p>

      <p>Vue bosses meanwhile have decided to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-vue-bans-blue-story-20949659">ban the controversial Blue Story film</a>, said to be linked to the violence.</p>
      <p>And rival <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-blue-story-film-banned-20950780">Showcase Cinema has decided to axe it</a> from four venues, including Leeds and Reading.</p>
      <p>Blue Story is a gangster film portrays inner-city gang violence. Directed and written by music artist Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, is based on his own experiences of gang violence and carries a pacifist message.</p>
