      <p>BBC’s hotly-anticipated War of the Worlds <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/the-war-of-the-worlds-recap-5-questions-we-need-answered-after-episode-1-11091598/">aired its first episode last week</a>.</p>
      <p>The series, starring <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/poldark/">Poldark</a>’s Eleanor Tomlinson, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rafe-spall/">Rafe Spall</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/robert-carlyle/">Robert Carlyle</a>, re-tells what’s considered the first ever tale of a conflict between mankind and extra-terrestrial life.</p>
      <p>Where was the show filmed?</p>
      <h3>When is the War of the Worlds set?</h3>
      <p>In the original <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/wrote-war-worlds-11171555/">book written by HG Wells</a>, the majority of the story takes place in Woking, Surrey where Wells was based at the time of writing.</p>

      <p>He wrote it for a contemporary audience so the story is set in Victorian times, between 1895 and 1897 – when he wrote the story.</p>
      <p>The BBC’s latest adaptation of the show – which launched to nearly five million viewers last Sunday – is sticking with the original setting, but the crew went elsewhere to film the show.</p>
      <h3>War of the Worlds filming locations</h3>

      <h4>Liverpool</h4>
      <p>The location manager for the show, Andrew Bainbridge, told Radio Times that the majority of the shooting was done in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The show’s director, Craig Viveiros, explained why Liverpool was perfect for the shoot.</p>

      <p>He told Radio Times that the city’s benefits included ‘the sort of architecture… in close proximity, and being able to close it off to shoot – to dress it, to bring the horse and carts in.’</p>
      <p>St George’s Hall – across from Liverpool Lime Street station – features heavily in the three-part series.</p>
      <h4>Great Budworth, Cheshire</h4>
      <p>The picturesque little village was used as a replica for Woking.</p>
      <p>Viveiros explained to Radio Times that the village had to be shut off for three weeks while filming took place.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘the challenge there was to bring all the villagers onside. We were going to be there for three weeks. We had to completely close the village traffic. That was quite a number.’</p>

      <h4>Ainsdale Nature Reserve, Southport</h4>
      <p>Some shots were taken at the nature reserve in the borough of Sefton.</p>
      <p>In a fortunate bit of timing, director Viveiros said how ‘the heather actually needed to be burnt, so they were welcoming to us.’</p>
      <h4>Delamere Forest, Cheshire</h4>
      <p>The dense forest, located between Northwich and Chester, provided the perfect location for scenes showing the aftermath of the alien invasion.</p>
