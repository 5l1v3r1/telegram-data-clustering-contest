      <h1>K-pop star Goo Hara found dead at her home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:24:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>K-pop star Goo Hara was found dead at her home on Sunday, South Korean police confirmed.</p>
      <p>Goo, a former member of girl group Kara, was discovered at her home in Seoul early Sunday evening, officers said.</p>
      <p>The exact cause of death was still under investigation, they added.</p>
      <p>South Korea has one of the world's highest rates of suicide which, according to recent government figures, is among the top causes of death for those under 40.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old's death comes a month after Sulli -- another K-pop star and Goo's close friend -- took her own life after a long struggle with online bullying.</p>
      <p>The singer had posted a tearful message on her Instagram shortly after Sulli's death, grieving the passing of her friend.</p>
      <p>In messages posted on social media, fans mourned Goo's death, with one writing: "I hope you have a good sleep in heaven without any worries."</p>
      <p>After performing in Kara from 2008 to 2015, she focused on her solo career after the group broke up and had just completed a tour of Japan with her latest release.</p>
