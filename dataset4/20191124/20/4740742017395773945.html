      <h1>McDonald's customers slam festive drinks added to menu</h1>
      <h2>A spokesperson for the chain addressed the complaints</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:06:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Sansome, Andrew McQuarrie</a></address>
      <p>Some McDonald's customers have been left disappointed by festive drinks on offer - with one punter claiming their day was "ruined" by a beverage.</p>
      <p>The fast-food chain's Christmas menu includes a Millionaire's Latte and a Toffee Latte.</p>
      <p>But some customers have revealed they were less than impressed with the products, according to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/mcdonalds-lattes-millionaires-toffee-chistmas-17302444?_ga=2.35995938.382640521.1574544750-792478168.1557222479">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>One angry social media user wrote: "Fuming mate, second Millionaire Latte from  <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds">@McDonalds</a>  WITHOUT cream. No it hadn't melted and no it hadn't stuck to the lid. Day, ruined."</p>

      <p>Another tweeted: "@McDonaldsUK @McDonalds is this meant to be your Christmas millionaires edition? First of all it's not even full, second it's definitely not the advertised one #McDonalds #mcdonaldsuk."</p>
      <p>A third, meanwhile, wrote: "What is that!?  <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds">@McDonalds</a>  it’s supposed to be a toffee latte but you seem to have forgotten to put the latte in there!"</p>

      <p>A McDonald's spokesperson addressed the complaints by suggesting that a "great flavour" would be guaranteed, even if the cream had melted.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said: "As with any cream on top of a hot drink, if left for a period of time, our swirl of chocolate cream and a caramel drizzle will blend into the latte.</p>
      <p>"Most of our customers are loving it too much to leave it that long, but if it does melt then you’ll still get all of the great flavours, just combined with your drink instead of on top."</p>
