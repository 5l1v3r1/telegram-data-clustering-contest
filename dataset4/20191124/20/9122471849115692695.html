      <h1>Video: Jon Gruden’s NSFW Message To Referee Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:44:11+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jon Gruden is not a happy man today. The Oakland Raiders are currently getting shellacked by the New York Jets. It’s Jets 34, Raiders 3 in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Yikes.</p>
      <p>Gruden hasn’t been happy all day, it appears.</p>
      <p>The Raiders’ head coach had a NSFW message for an official when the game was tied, 3-3, early in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>
        <i>WARNING: The language is graphic.</i>

      <p>It’s not very hard to read his lips there…</p>
      <p>Gruden had a reason to be upset, though. This was called roughing the passer:</p>

      <p>That might be one of the worst calls of the season. Bad call or not, though, the Raiders have not played well enough to win.</p>
      <p>Oakland had been playing better as of late, but the Raiders will suffer a bad loss against the Jets today. Gruden’s team will drop to 6-5 with the loss. New York, meanwhile, will improve to 4-7.</p>
