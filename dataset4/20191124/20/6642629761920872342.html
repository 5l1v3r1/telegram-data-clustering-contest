      <p>"The vice president resorted to unduly baiting international attention on the matter," Duterte spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a statement announcing Robredo's immediate dismissal.<br/><br/>"Essentially, what the vice president has done is to embarrass our country," Panelo added.<br/><br/>Robredo's spokesman said he was not aware of her receiving any formal dismissal notice, adding "as usual, announced to media without the courtesy of directly informing [her]".</p>
      <p>Presidents and vice presidents are elected separately in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/philippines.html">Philippines</a>, resulting in candidates from rival parties such as Duterte and Robredo ending up in the country's top leadership - and often colliding on policies.</p>
      <p>Robredo, 58, a respected former human rights lawyer and political newcomer, has openly criticised the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2019/10/dutertes-war-191011053006171.html">campaign against illegal drugs</a> that Duterte launched when he took office in mid-2016.</p>
      <p>Piqued by Robredo's constant criticism of his drug campaign, Duterte formalised an offer last month to appoint her as one of two heads of an inter-agency committee that includes the police and the military and is tasked with overseeing and coordinating the government's efforts to combat illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>"She wasted such opportunity and used the same as a platform to attack the methods undertaken by this administration," Panelo said. "Such tack was even motivated by hubris to prove their past arguments against the anti-illegal drug operations were correct."</p>
      <p>More than two weeks after accepting the post, Robredo "has not presented any new programme that she envisioned to implement. In a campaign where people's lives are at risk, a day is an eternity," Panelo said.</p>
