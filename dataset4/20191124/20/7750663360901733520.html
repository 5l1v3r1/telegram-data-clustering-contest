      <p>The Black and Yellows have slipped to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bundesliga/table.html">sixth in the Bundesliga</a> after a series of disappointing results, most recently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bundesliga/bayern-munich-vs-borussia-dortmund_game_100354.html">a 4-0 thrashing</a> by Bayern Munich and a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bundesliga/borussia-dortmund-vs-paderborn_game_101496.html">disappointing 3-3 draw</a> with bottom side SC Paderborn in which they had to come back from three goals down.</p>
      <p>Dortmund can move one stop closer to qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday when they face Barcelona and while Favre will remain in charge for that game, Zorc has issued a warning to the Swiss manager.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Funke Sport</i>, Zorc said: "Obviously the topic will be discussed publicly because our situation is more than unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p>"Of course we will analyse that very intensively. But we are going to the match in Barcelona with Lucien Favre and we expect to see a significant increase in performance there.</p>
      <p>"We need a performance. We finally need a good performance on the pitch so you can look forward."</p>
      <p>Formerly of Borussia Monchengladbach and Nice, Favre guided Dortmund to second in the Bundesliga last season in his first full campaign in charge.</p>
