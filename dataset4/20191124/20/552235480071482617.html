      <p>Former Kilmarnock star Jamie Hamill is getting set to head to Ibrox in the Scottish Cup.</p>
      <p>The former Rugby Park utility man will grace the pitch at Rangers' home on January 18 as Stranraer take them on.</p>
      <p>He left Killie in 2011 to head to Hearts, before returning to Rugby Park for a second spell between 2014 and 2016.</p>
      <p>He has made 101 appearances for Stranraer since joining in 2017.</p>
