      </figure>
      <p>This Wednesday will see a clash between <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/valencia">Valencia</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a> in Group H of the UEFA Champions League, and there’s no doubt that this one will be pivotal for both sides in terms of their chances of making the knockout stages. Both Valencia and Chelsea currently sit on 7 points along with group leaders Ajax, with the Dutch side ahead by virtue of goal difference.</p>
      <p>The winners here will be likely to progress into the Round of 16, while the losers will probably have to rely on a slip-up by Ajax to make it through. Domestically, Frank Lampard’s side saw an unbeaten Premier League run dating back to September broken this weekend by Manchester City, while Valencia have won just 2 of their last 6 league fixtures.</p>

      <h3>Valencia vs Chelsea Head-to-Head</h3>
      <p>It’s been a topsy-turvy Champions League campaign for both sides thus far; Valencia started off by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, but then collapsed at home to Ajax and only captured a point away at Lille before defeating the French side at home.</p>
      <p>Chelsea meanwhile bounced back from that defeat to Valencia to beat Lille and Ajax in away fixtures, and their last game saw a truly crazy 4-4 draw with Ajax at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <h3>Valencia vs Chelsea Team News</h3>
      <p>With N’Golo Kante returning from injury in Chelsea’s defeat to Manchester City on Saturday, Frank Lampard has just a handful of concerns coming into Wednesday’s match at the Mestalla. Antonio Rudiger remains sidelined with a pelvic issue, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek is still in the recovery phase following his Achilles tear. Ross Barkley meanwhile has an ongoing ankle injury that will keep him out.</p>
      <p>None of the Blues’ players are suspended for this game.</p>
      <p><b>Injuries: </b>Antonio Rudiger (pelvis), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Achilles), Ross Barkley (ankle)</p>

      <h3>Valencia vs Chelsea Predicted XI</h3>
      <p><b>Chelsea Predicted XI: </b>Kepa Arrizabalaga, Cesar Azpilicueta, Fikayo Tomori, Kurt Zouma, Emerson, N’Golo Kante, Mateo Kovacic, Mason Mount, Willian, Christian Pulisic, Tammy Abraham</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Valencia vs Chelsea Prediction</h3>
      <p>This should be an interesting test for Frank Lampard’s young Blues side but it’s one I feel they’ll pass; they’ve come a long way since their loss to Valencia back in September and even then, Chelsea had enough chances to win the game. Valencia suffered a domestic loss this weekend due to an injury-time goal which should harm any momentum they might’ve brought into the match, and with Kovacic, Pulisic and Abraham showing serious form recently, I feel like Chelsea will come out on top here.</p>
      <p><b>Verdict: </b>Valencia 1-3 Chelsea</p>
