      <h1>Dave Cormack investment to take on Celtic and Rangers</h1>
      <h2>The new Aberdeen chief has revealed his grand plan to get his challenging Scottish football's big two.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:42:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Incoming chairman <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Dave Cormack</a> has claimed his takeover will give Aberdeen the financial muscle to punch above their weight and to take on Celtic and Rangers.</p>
      <p>He has confirmed his pending appointment will bring another £5million of investment to Pittodrie and secure a tie-up with MLS side Atlanta United.</p>
      <p>The Dons confirmed on Sunday that the life-long Dons fan will be taking over as chairman from Stewart Milne after next month’s Annual General Meeting.</p>
      <p>Cormack, who has already brought in more than £11.2 million in investment to the club, will step up from vice-chairman and his full vision for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> will be unveiled at a press conference on Monday.</p>

      <p>Atlanta United’s owners AMB Sports and Entertainments are to invest £2 million in the club and bring a strategic and scouting link-up with the Dons, while fellow Americans Tom Crotty and Roger Lee will top up the new monies coming in.</p>
      <p>Cormack confirmed: “I’m pleased to be able to announce a strategic partnership with Atlanta United and further investment from myself, Tom and Roger.</p>
      <p>“There are some real challenges ahead but, with the support of my fellow directors and new investors, along with our fans, we will do our utmost to deliver success which, at the end of the day, is measured by the team’s performance.\</p>
      <p>“The new investment and this partnership with Atlanta will allow us to punch above our weight, aspiring to attain UEFA top 100 status and to trying to level the playing field against significantly higher income generated by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .”</p>
      <p>Milne believes after helping to deliver the new £12 million Cormack Park training ground that the time was right to step down after 21 years at the helm.</p>

      <p>Milne added: “I’m proud to have had the opportunity to lead the club I love for two decades</p>
      <p>“In bringing Dave on to the board and appointing him vice-chairman, we viewed him as the natural successor.</p>
      <p>“He is prepared to take on the commitment and has already proved his ability to secure significant new investment.</p>
      <p>“More importantly he is passionate about Aberdeen and the club.”</p>
      <p>Aberdeen striker Sam Cosgrove believes it is exciting times for the club.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve only been here for two years but you can see the influence the chairman had around the club.</p>

      <p>“I know the history behind it and what he has done for the club is unbelievable but Dave will add a new sense of energy and it’s definitely a positive for the club.”</p>
      <p>It will see a change in guard at Pittodrie.  Craig Brown, Duncan Skinner and Ian Jack will step down from the board while Duncan Fraser will also leave his chief executive role, while Atlanta United president Darren Eales will become a director.  Brown will remain as a club ambassador while Skinner will continue to oversee the AFC Community Trust.</p>
      <p>The Dons also announced their financial figures.  They have announced a record turnover of £15.9 million while staff costs are also up to £9.24 million, resulting in a pre-amortisation loss of around £580,000 for the year.</p>
