      <h1>How Paris Saint-Germain could line up against Real Madrid</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/psg/"><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b></a> will be looking to make sure of first position in the section when they travel to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> for their penultimate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> group-stage clash on Tuesday night.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thomas-tuchel/"><b>Thomas Tuchel</b></a>'s side sit five points clear at the top of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/group-a.html">Group A</a> having won all four of their fixtures to date, and a point at the Bernabeu would be enough to secure first spot.</p>
      <p>The Ligue 1 giants recorded a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/champions-league/result/result-di-maria-scores-twice-as-psg-beat-real-madrid_371930.html">3-0 win</a> in the reverse match earlier this season, but they have not actually beaten Madrid in Spain since the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how PSG could line up on Tuesday evening.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thilo-kehrer/"><b>Thilo Kehrer</b></a> (foot)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ander-herrera/"><b>Ander Herrera</b></a> (thigh), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-verratti/"><b>Marco Verratti</b></a> (knee)</p>
      <p>PSG will again be without the services of Thilo Kehrer due to a foot injury, while Ander Herrera faces a battle to shake off a thigh problem in time for Tuesday's encounter in Spain.</p>
      <p>Marco Verratti is said to be winning his race to overcome a knee injury, though, and the Italy international looks set to line up alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marquinhos/"><b>Marquinhos</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/idrissa-gueye/"><b>Idrissa Gueye</b></a> in central midfield.</p>
      <p>The back five almost picks itself with just a slight debate over whether <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/colin-dagba/"><b>Colin Dagba</b></a> or <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thomas-meunier/"><b>Thomas Meunier</b></a> feature at right-back, but there are a number of decisions to be made further forward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angel-di-maria/"><b>Angel Di Maria</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neymar/"><b>Neymar</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kylian-mbappe/"><b>Kylian Mbappe</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauro-icardi/"><b>Mauro Icardi</b></a> are battling for the three spots in the final third, and the latter might well miss out despite his excellent form.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Icardi has scored 10 times in 11 appearances this season, including four times in his last three Champions League outings, but Tuchel might take the chance to trial a front three of Di Maria, Mbappe and Neymar with a spot in the last-16 already secure.</p>
