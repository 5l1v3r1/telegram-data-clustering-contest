      <h1>Steelers bench struggling QB Mason Rudolph for Devlin Hodges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:24:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Brooke Pryor</a></address>
      <p>CINCINNATI -- The <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> couldn't wait any longer.</p>
      <p>After a stagnant drive to open the third quarter while trailing the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals">Bengals</a> 7-3, the Steelers benched starting quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> in favor of backup <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3127051/devlin-hodges">Devlin "Duck" Hodges</a>.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was sacked on the first play of the drive for a loss of 13 yards when he couldn't find an open receiver. Two plays later, he threw a wobbly pass that fell incomplete and sent the Steelers' offense off the field for the third three-and-out of the afternoon.</p>
      <p>The offense responded immediately to Hodges, scoring a touchdown on the rookie's first drive. He threw an 11-yard pass to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116721/jaylen-samuels">Jaylen Samuels</a> on his first play, and connected with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122449/james-washington">James Washington</a> for a 79-yard touchdown a couple of plays later. It was the Steelers' first touchdown since the third quarter of their 21-7 loss to Cleveland last week.</p>
      <p>Hodges finished the game 5-of-11 for 118 yards and helped lead the Steelers to a 16-10 comeback win.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was abysmal before he got benched, completing just 8 of 16 pass attempts for 65 yards. He ended the Steelers' second drive with an interception in the red zone.</p>
      <p>The offense had just three plays of at least 10 yards in the first half -- all coming from players signed off practice squads eight days earlier. Running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3919104/kerrith-whyte">Kerrith Whyte</a> had a 21-yard rush and a 16-yard carry in the drive that ended with Rudolph's interception. And wide receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3728254/deon-cain">Deon Cain</a> made a 35-yard catch in the second quarter on second-and-21.</p>
      <p>Rudolph's performance in Cincinnati was the latest in a series of rough games for the second-year quarterback. The loss in Cleveland will most be remembered for Rudolph's fight with Myles Garrett, but prior to that, he threw four interceptions.</p>
      <p>Rudolph has thrown for 1,551 yards with 12 touchdowns to eight interceptions since taking over for Ben Roethlisberger in Week 2, when the franchise quarterback went down with a season-ending elbow injury. Rudolph's QBR of 35.0 ranks 31st in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Hodges took over for Rudolph once before this season, coming in when Rudolph sustained a concussion against the Ravens in Week 5. Hodges started the next week against the L.A. Chargers before Rudolph resumed his starting duties after the bye week.</p>
