      <h1>Will do anything to get unauthorised colonies registered: Delhi CM Kejriwal</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:18:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Asking people to be wary of the Centre’s announcement that ownership rights in unauthorised colonies will be granted soon, Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> Sunday said he will ensure that properties in these areas are registered soon.</p>
      <p>“In 2008… two months before the elections, provisional certificates were issued. But the promise to regularise was not carried out. The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> wants to regularise the colonies but does not want to register them. I promise you all I will do anything to register these colonies… Do not trust anyone unless they grant registration,” said Kejriwal, who was speaking at Burari’s Sant Nagar after inaugurating development work in the unauthorised colony.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Union Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the process of regularising unauthorised colonies will be completed within three months, with the DDA set to launch a portal enabling people to file applications for ownership rights on December 16.</p>
      <p>While residents from unauthorised colonies supported the AAP in 2013 and 2015 Assembly polls, the BJP is trying to capture the vote bank this time. “Delhi BJP is going from colony to colony to tell people about the announcement,” said a senior BJP leader.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the CM said that the Opposition will roll back initiatives such as free travel for women and 200 units of free power, if elected to power.</p>
