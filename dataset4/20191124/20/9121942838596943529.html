      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The most prominent sign of the growing popularity of ukuleles among Anchorage students is East High’s orchestra dedicated to the short-necked relative of the guitar.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reported the Anchorage School District has seen a wave of aspiring student musicians who want to pluck the small, four-stringed instruments.</p>
      <p>Officials say the number of students enrolled in a ukulele class at East High has eclipsed those in a guitar class, while the ukulele orchestra has nearly 20 players.</p>
      <p>East High guitar and ukulele teacher Kiel Schweizer says reasons for the student attraction to ukuleles include affordability, portability and ease of play, as well as their popularity on YouTube.</p>
      <p>The instrument is also embedded in the Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander culture of 15% of the school’s students.</p>
