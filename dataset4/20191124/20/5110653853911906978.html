      <p>Youngstown State quarterback Nathan Mays may not have got the senior season he wanted this year, but his teammates on Saturday ensured his last game would be unforgettable nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Mays, whose career ended after he broke his leg and dislocated his ankle in his team's Nov. 2 matchup vs. North Dakota State, was helped onto the field by teammates on Saturday so he could take the victory kneel in a 21-3 win over No. 7 Illinois State.</p>
