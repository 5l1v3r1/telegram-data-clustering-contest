      <h1>Tom Brady Gives Honest Response To Question About Future With Patriots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:12:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Tom Brady has accomplished everything there is to accomplish in professional football – all with the New England Patriots. So it’s not unfair to ask if Brady would want to try to add to his legacy by winning with another team.</p>
      <p>Considering that Brady will be out of contract at the end of this year, that speculation is only going to get louder.</p>
      <p>So in a recent interview, Brady answered the question of what his future holds.</p>
      <p>In an interview with FOX, Brady asserterted that he can’t predict what happens next in his career. But he maintained that he plans to play longer no matter what.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think the reality is there is no prediction. I have always said I have a plan to play longer and I will figure that out when the time comes.”</blockquote>

      <p>The Patriots are 9-1 on the season thanks in no small part to the league’s best defense combined with a cupcake schedule.</p>
      <p>Tom Brady has been as efficient with the ball as ever, but the team is running so smoothly that even when he struggles occasionally, the Patriots still win.</p>
      <p>But until the Patriots give clear indications that they don’t need Brady anymore, we can’t assume that his contract year will truly be his last year.</p>
