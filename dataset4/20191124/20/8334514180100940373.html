      <p>No casualties had been reported to date, SIAS, the company which operates the A6 highway linking the coast to Turin, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s effort at this stage is aimed at confirming that this is the case” Autostrada dei Fiori, a unit of SIAS, said.</p>
      <p>SIAS said the collapse of around 20 meters of the 50-meter long viaduct located just outside Savona came after an “exceptional” landslide caused by days of heavy rain.</p>
      <p>The landslide originated from a mountain which overlooks the motorway and hit one of the pillars of the bridge at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), SIAS said, adding that it was not responsible for the condition of the mountain.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Liguria’s president Giovanni Toti said at a news conference that the bridge collapse might have affected one car but that he had no evidence and searches were continuing.</p>
      <p>Liguria is the same region where a motorway bridge collapsed last year in Genoa, killing 43 people. Known as the Morandi Bridge, it was operated by Autostrade per l’Italia, a unit of infrastructure group Atlantia.</p>
      <p>Heavy rains have caused widespread flooding in northern Italy this month.</p>
      <p>SIAS said the motorway had been shut in both directions, although only one of the two separate carriageways had collapsed while first assessments indicated the other was undamaged.</p>
      <p>Toti said that a local road near the motorway had also been washed away by the landslide.</p>
