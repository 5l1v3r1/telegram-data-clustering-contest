      <p>Mason Rudolph’s whirlwind week-and-a-half ended up with him on the bench.</p>
      <p>Ten days after being involved in a big Steelers-Browns brawl during which Myles Garrett took his helmet off and hit him with it, Rudolph was benched by Mike Tomlin early in the second quarter, with undrafted free agent Devlin Hodges taking over at quarterback.</p>
      <p>The Steelers trailed the winless Bengals 7-3 at halftime, and after a three-and-out to begin the second half, Tomlin decided a change was necessary. Rudolph was 8-for-16 with 85 yards and an interception when he was yanked.</p>
      <p>Hodges came in and promptly threw a 79-yard touchdown to James Washington to give Pittsburgh a 10-7 lead.</p>
      <p>Rudolph has been starting for the Steelers since Ben Roethlisberger went down in Week 2 with a season-ending elbow injury. Rudolph was<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/nfl-punishes-mason-rudolph-for-myles-garrett-fight/"> fined $50,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct</a> after the brawl.</p>
