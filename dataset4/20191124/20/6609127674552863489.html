      <p>She hopes to prevent mental and physical torment of students, 3½ years after Emily, 18, was allegedly driven to her death by her brute ex.</p>
      <p>Fiona, of Muirend, Glasgow, said: “It is vital staff recognise the impact of trauma and sustained abuse on young people.</p>
      <p>“Emily did report what happened to her.</p>
      <p>“While universities can’t conduct criminal investigations, they have a duty to act on disclosures and safeguard all involved.”</p>
      <blockquote>It is vital staff recognise the impact of trauma and sustained abuse on young people.<cite>Fiona Drouet</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Aberdeen Uni law student Emily took her own life in March 2016.</p>
      <p>Ex Angus Milligan, 23, admitted assaulting her days earlier but got just 180 hours’ unpaid work.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Sun previously reported how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4750918/emily-drouet-suicide-angus-milligan-sorry/">Milligan fled</a> when asked to say sorry to Emily's family earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The thug legged it when quizzed about his ex’s death.</p>
      <p>In September, we told how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4671927/emily-drouet-suicide-angus-milligan/">Milligan</a> had mocked a school anti-bullying video.</p>
      <p>The violent brute was caught using the phrase ‘Iz dat u Kim?’ as his bio status on WhatsApp — from an educational film shown in classrooms where a victim replies to an online troll.</p>
      <p>Emily's mum blasted the thug for adopting the phrase three years after he allegedly drove her daughter, 18, to her death.</p>
      <h3>YOU'RE NOT ALONE</h3>
      <p>
        <b>EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p>
      <p>It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p>
      <p>And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women.</p>
      <p>Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p>
      <p>That is why <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youre-not-alone/">The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign.</a></p>
      <p>The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.</p>
      <p>Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7194521/the-sun-suicide-prevention-campaign-launch/">You're Not Alone.</a></p>
