      <h1>‘I don’t know how to dribble’ – Barcelona’s Griezmann speaks at Puma event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:18:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:18</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7714065/I-dont-know-dribble-Antoine-Griezmann-makes-astonishing-admission-Puma-event.html?__twitter_impression=true">MailOnline</a>, Barcelona superstar Antoine Griezmann has surprisingly admitted that he doesn’t know how to dribble whilst speaking at a Puma event in Spain.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner professed that his skills lie in other areas of the game, he may have even surprised some of his teammates with his comments.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BarcaTimes/status/1197669714421526529">BarcaTimes</a> understand that Griezmann was at the event alongside; current teammates Luis Suarez and Samuel Umtiti, French legend Thierry Henry and former teammate Jan Oblak.</p>

        <b>Here’s what the Frenchman had to say at the Puma event in Spain:</b>
      </p>
      <p>‘I don’t know how to dribble, I like to take one or two touches, at pace,’</p>
      <p>‘I like that the ball comes out cleanly and to shoot at goal.’</p>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/news/1277948/barca-sign-antoine-griezmann">Barcelona’s official website</a>, the La Liga champions paid the forward’s mammoth €120m release clause to sign him from Atletico Madrid this summer.</p>
      <p>Griezmann has so far struggled to prove his marquee price-tag, the superstar only has four goals in 16 appearances across all competitions.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde will have to conjure up a plan to get the best out of the Frenchman very soon considering the club’s massive investment into his signature.</p>
      <p>Griezmann will have to be at his best if Barcelona are serious about re-establishing themselves as the best team in the world. The Blaugrana haven’t won a Champions League title since the 2014/15 season.</p>
