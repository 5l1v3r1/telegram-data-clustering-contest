      <h1>How Real Madrid could line up against Paris Saint-Germain</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> will switch their attention back to the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> on Tuesday night as they prepare to welcome <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/psg/"><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b></a> to the Bernabeu.</h2>

      <p>PSG have already booked their spot in the next round of the competition, while a win for Madrid would be enough for them to join the French giants in the last-16 stage.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos can also still technically finish top of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/group-a.html">Group A</a>, although PSG are very much in the driving seat having won each of their four matches in the section.</p>
      <p>Madrid suffered a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/champions-league/result/result-di-maria-scores-twice-as-psg-beat-real-madrid_371930.html">3-0 defeat</a> in the reverse match earlier this season but have not actually lost to the French giants on home soil since the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup back in 1994.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the capital side could line up on Tuesday night.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-asensio/"><b>Marco Asensio</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-rodriguez/"><b>James Rodriguez</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nacho/"><b>Nacho</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-vazquez/"><b>Lucas Vazquez</b></a> (toe)</p>
      <p>Madrid will again be without the services of Marco Asensio, James Rodriguez, Nacho and Lucas Vazquez through injury, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s side did not pick up any fresh issues against Real Sociedad on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gareth-bale/"><b>Gareth Bale</b></a> was booed upon entering the field as a second-half substitute, and it seems unlikely that the Wales international will start, meaning that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodrygo-goes/"><b>Rodrygo Goes</b></a> could again join <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eden-hazard/"><b>Eden Hazard</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/karim-benzema/"><b>Karim Benzema</b></a> in attack.</p>
      <p>Further back, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toni-kroos/"><b>Toni Kroos</b></a> for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/federico-valverde/"><b>Federico Valverde</b></a> is an alteration that could be made, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ferland-mendy/"><b>Ferland Mendy</b></a> is expected to keep out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcelo/"><b>Marcelo</b></a> at left-back once again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thibaut-courtois/"><b>Thibaut Courtois</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dani-carvajal/"><b>Dani Carvajal</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergio-ramos/"><b>Sergio Ramos</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raphael-varane/"><b>Raphael Varane</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/casemiro/"><b>Casemiro</b></a> are all certain starters for the Spanish side, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/isco/"><b>Isco</b></a> is an option having featured off the bench at the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vinicius-junior/"><b>Vinicius Junior</b></a> will also be hoping for a recall having been left out entirely against Sociedad, although the Brazilian is yet to start a Champions League fixture this term.</p>
