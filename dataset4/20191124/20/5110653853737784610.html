So yes, you get the game on TV.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As is the case in most big NFL games, the quarterbacks are the key players Sunday night. Especially if Jimmy Garoppolo continues his hot streak. The San Francisco QBpassed for a career-high 424 yards with 4 TDs and 2 INTs for 115.4 passer rating last week. Yet he's facing a future Hall of Famer who has been particularly good against the 49ers.</p>
      <p>Aaron Rodgers has 1,927 pass yards (321.2 per game) and 13 TDs vs. 2 INTs for a 105.1 passer rating in six career starts vs. the 49ers. That includes his 425 passing yards in their last meeting in October of last season.</p>

      <h3>49ers vs. Packers: What time is kickoff?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Date</b>: Sunday, Nov. 24</li>
        <li><b>Start time</b>: 8:20 p.m. ET</li>

After Green Bay, San Francisco draws 8-2 Baltimore on the road in Week 13, then 8-2 New Orleans, also on the road, in Week 14.</p>
