      <p><b>MILAN —</b> Felipe Caicedo snatched a late winner to keep Lazio third in Serie A with a 2-1 victory over Sassuolo on Sunday just ahead of city rivals Roma, who beat Brescia 3-0 with England defender Chris Smalling involved in all of his side's goals.<br/><br/>Champions Juventus maintained their grip on the top of Serie A with a 3-1 win at Atalanta on Saturday, to stay one-point ahead of Inter Milan who eased past Torino 3-0.<br/><br/>The two Roman outfits are now third and fourth respectively before Cagliari, a point behind in fifth, play lowly Lecce later on Sunday.<br/><br/>Serie A top scorer Ciro Immobile struck to put Lazio ahead after 34 minutes in Sassuolo with his 15th league goal this season.<br/><br/>But struggling Sassuolo pulled back a goal back through Francesco Caputo just before the break.<br/><br/>Ecuadorian Caicedo came off the bench to seal a fifth consecutive league win in injury time to keep Lazio seven points behind Inter Milan in third place.<br/><br/>Roma are now two points behind their local rivals after defender Smalling scored and set up the other two goals in a victory over bottom club Brescia.<br/><br/>Smalling, on-loan for the season from Manchester United, headed in the first from a corner after 48 minutes in the Stadio Olimpico.<br/><br/>The 30-year-old then provided the cross that allowed fellow defender Gianluca Mancini to volley in eight minutes later, with Edin Dzeko completing the rout on 66 minutes after Smalling's headed assist.<br/><br/>Brescia, now coached by 2006 World Cup winner Fabio Grosso, remain rooted to the bottom of the table.<br/><br/>Forward Mario Balotelli was dropped for Sunday's game because of his lack of commitment in training.<br/><br/>The Italy international tried to play down Thursday's training ground bust-up with Grosso.<br/><br/>"Recovery! Coming back soon, for the moment let them talk," the former Marseille attacker said in a post on Instagram showing him undergoing physiotherapy.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Samuel Di Carmine scored the only goal as Verona piled the pressure on Fiorentina, despite Franck Ribery returning after his three-match suspension.<br/><br/>The Tuscany side are in tenth place with just one point from their last three games. — AFP</p>
