      <p>She ditched his band Try Star, and his bandmates Levi Davis and Ben Foden, during last night’s episode.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Nicole is really into Thom and she didn’t want jokes being made about them.</p>

      <p>Former Scots rugby player Thom, 34, didn’t harbour any hard feelings against Nicole who stole the show in a barely-there pink dress.</p>

      <p>The smitten pair were pictured partying together in London following the elimination on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Sun On Sunday previously revealed how the pair had started dating after falling for one another on the show.</p>
      <p>A source said: Thom is completely Nicole’s type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>“He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>
