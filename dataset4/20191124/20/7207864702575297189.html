      <h1>This Is Why The Fed Must Keep Cutting Interest Rates</h1>
      <h2>Or else America could be in for a world of pain.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:15:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Andreas Kern</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>High corporate debt and faltering profits have created an unstable environment.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is stuck between an apparently booming economy and a financial crisis that might be right around the corner.</p>
      <p>That’s why its decision to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-30/fed-cuts-rates-by-quarter-point-while-hinting-at-a-policy-pause?srnd=premium">cut interest rates by another quarter point</a> on Oct. 30 – <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">its third reduction in as many months</a> – seems so odd. Lowering rates when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/30/french-economy-growth-expectations-us-federal-reserve-powell-trump-pound-brexit-business-live">economy is as strong</a> as the numbers make it out to be is practically unheard of. And, according to <a href="https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Macroeconomics/p/1319105998">textbook economics</a>, lowering interest rates during a boom is a sure recipe for disaster.</p>
      <p>The trouble is, as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=SDV5M2gAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">someone who studies financial booms and busts</a>, I know that not lowering rates may be even worse. That’s because the corporate sector is dangerously over-indebted, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/why-the-corporate-debt-bubble-may-burst-sooner-than-you-think-4587446">creating a financial bubble</a>.</p>
      <p>A hike in borrowing costs could kick-start a cascade of bankruptcies in a financial contagion that would derail the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Troubles Below the Surface</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the surface, the U.S. economy appears to be humming along just fine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">Unemployment’s at a half-century low</a>. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">Inflation is near its target of 2%</a>. And, at about 125 months, the U.S. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP">is charting its longest economic expansion since at least the 1850s</a>.</p>
      <p>Look under the hood, however, and things look very troublesome.</p>
      <p>Numerous trade wars have cost U.S. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26396.pdf">companies</a>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-trade-war-farmers-land-olakes-1463492">farmers</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/economy/trade-war-costs.html">consumers</a> dearly. The manufacturing industry – once America’s job engine and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/05/trump-said-hed-rebuild-manufacturing-now-its-decline-what-happened/">ostensibly the sector the trade war was supposed to support</a> – <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-factory-slump-shows-manufacturing-isnt-the-bellwether-it-used-to-be-11572195680?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f">is seeing its worst year since 2009</a>.</p>
      <p>And looking abroad, the situation is even worse, with the global economy slowing and the International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/imf-recession-world-growth-forecast-central-banks">warning there’s little ammunition left</a> to fight a recession.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Corporate Debt Bubble</b>
      </p>
      <p>While that’s bad, we haven’t gotten to the scary part yet.</p>
      <p>A key cause of the 2008 financial crisis <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/97299-leverage-101-the-real-cause-of-the-financial-crisis">was too much debt</a> in the housing market, much of which ultimately went bad.</p>
      <p>Today, the problem is in corporate America. Since 2008, when the Fed drove its <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU">target interest rate to a record-low 0.25%</a>, markets have been flooded with cheap money. That was too much to resist for U.S. companies, which went on a borrowing binge.</p>
      <p>All American companies are currently sitting on a record <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/07/25/u-s-corporate-debt-continues-to-rise-as-do-problem-leveraged-loans/#7de908a83596">US$15.5 trillion in debt</a>, equivalent to about two-thirds of U.S. GDP. Unfortunately, this debt was not primarily used to finance expansion and growth but more commonly to <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/is-there-too-much-business-debt.html">jack up stock prices through dividends, stock buybacks and acquisitions</a>.</p>
      <p>The problem will come when the party stops – when interest rates begin rising and companies, particular the ones that took more risks, can’t refinance or pay back their debts. This is what turns a credit boom <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w18379.pdf">into a financial crisis, as happened in 2008</a>.</p>
      <p>The IMF estimates that half of corporate debt – excluding small businesses – <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2019/10/01/global-financial-stability-report-october-2019#Chapter2">is high risk, or junk rated</a>, which has a much higher chance of default than investment grade debt.</p>
      <p>What makes the situation even worse is that $660 billion of companies’ so-called leveraged debt <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/risky-loans-in-the-clo-market-could-be-trouble-for-u-s-companies">is held in collateralized loan obligations</a> that have been sold to a variety of investors and financial institutions. While this has helped keep rates even lower, a rise in delinquencies and defaults would cause losses in this market as well and a stampede of selling by investors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Downward Cycle</b>
      </p>
      <p>As this cycle spirals, it spurs rising unemployment, a drop in consumer spending, more bankruptcies and – if it’s not stopped – an economic recession. This is what happened in 2008 when subprime borrowers couldn’t pay back their mortgages in large numbers.</p>
      <p>In other words, in this environment of high – and in some pockets highly risky – corporate debt and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heres-the-most-recent-sign-the-economy-is-headed-for-recession/">faltering profits</a>, the slightest interest rate move in the wrong direction has the potential to <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/articles/a-40-billion-pile-of-leveraged-loans-is-battered-by-big-losses">transform debt into junk worth pennies on the dollar</a>.</p>
      <p>This is why the Fed has no choice but to keep lowering interest rates and keep them there. The gamble is that companies <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8cda6f4-f01c-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">will use the breathing space to get their houses in order</a>.</p>
      <p>If they don’t, we could be in for a world of pain.</p>
