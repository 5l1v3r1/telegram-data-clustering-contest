      <h1>Two seriously injured after crashing stolen motorbike, Gold Coast </h1>

      <p>Two men have been hospitalised in serious conditions after trying to flee a break and enter attempt in Kingsholme.</p>
      <p>It’s understood they were attempting to break into a home on Upper Ormeau Road around 6.00pm, when they were caught by neighbours.</p>
      <p>One of the neighbours reportedly copped a split lip after the would-be robbers hit him in the face with a bag, while another ended up with a broken nose in a scuffle.</p>
      <p>The two alleged offenders then fled the scene on a motorbike, but only made it a short way down the road before losing control of the vehicle and crashing.</p>
      <p>They’ve both been taken to the Gold Coast University Hospital in serious but stable conditions.</p>
      <p>One sustained chest injuries and was transported in a serious but stable condition to Gold Coast University Hospital with High Acuity Response Unit on board.</p>
      <p>The second patient was transported stable to Gold Coast University Hospital.</p>
      <p>The forensic crash unit is investigating.</p>
