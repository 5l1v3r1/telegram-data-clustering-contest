      <h1>Barcelona still waiting for Ousmane Dembele to arrive...</h1>
      <h2>The France forward has still not taken off since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:03:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author">Francesc J. Gimeno</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona forward Ousmane Dembele has not comfortable passed the good grace period afforded to all new signings. The former Borussia Dortmund player is in his third season at Camp Nou and during the majority of the 822 days have passed since Bar√ßa paid an initial 105 million euros for him, he's not lived up to expectations. The opposite, in fact. We're still waiting for him with a mix of impatience and resignation.</p>
      <p>So far, his time at the club has been marked by inconsistency and injuries (eight in total). He's hardly shown the talent which the club saw in him and has missed a lot of opportunities to make his case.</p>
      <h3>LEGANES</h3>
      <p>Dembele has shone at times (he scored the decisive goal in the Super Cup and has scored some stunning strikes) but at the same time he's not done enough and Saturday's game against Leganes was the prime of example. The France international signed off another disappointing game and not much of what he tried came off. It seems the 'Mosquito' doesn't bite much...</p>
      <p>He's been the centre of attention off the pitch too many times. Little by little, he seemed to have focused on his profession, but he has still not taken off and proven that he can be a star. His balance since 2017 is disappointing. At 22, he seems to be coming up to a crossroads. It's time to make his mark and confirm that those that bet on him were right to do so. If he doesn't, the debate will increase about his future next summer.</p>
      <h3>INJURIES</h3>
      <p>Since the start of the season, Dembele has missed six games through two different injuries and two more through suspension after getting sent off at Sevilla. He's played eight games. He's not scored in his last four. His last and only goal of the season was on Oct. 6, vs. Sevilla, when he was sent off. That's not enough for a player of his talent.</p>
      <p>In his first season, the two injuries he suffered (he missed 27 games) meant he was only able to score three times in La Liga and once in the Champions League. There was an improvement last season, 14 goals in 42 outings, but things have not followed the same line this year yet...</p>
