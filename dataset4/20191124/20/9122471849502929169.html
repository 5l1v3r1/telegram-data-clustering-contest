      <h1>Danny Kanell Shakes Up His Top 8 After Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:41:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Week 13 of the college football season is in the books, and Danny Kanell has updated his top eight rankings accordingly.</p>
      <p>Kanell’s weekly rankings are always fun to analyze, particularly because they typically cause consternation for some fan bases who feel their teams are being slighted. Usually, those fan bases are from the SEC.</p>
      <p>Today, fans of Alabama and Georgia might actually be somewhat happy with Kanell. He finally put their teams back in the top eight.</p>
      <p>Kanell’s top five looks exactly how it did one week ago. Oregon has been dropped after losing to Arizona State, as has Penn State. Georgia and Alabama replaced them.</p>

      <p>Clemson has been the No. 1 team on Kanell’s list all season, even though the Tigers aren’t No. 1 in either major poll or the CFP rankings.</p>
      <p>When the new playoff rankings are unveiled Tuesday, expect LSU, Ohio State and Clemson to be the top three in some order, with Georgia once coming in fourth. Alabama will be fifth again, and we’ll see if the committee slots Utah or Oklahoma at No. 6.</p>
