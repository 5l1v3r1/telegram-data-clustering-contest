      <p><a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a>’s first performance on the<a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/american-music-awards/"> American Music Awards</a> stage is in the books as the singer gave a dazzling rendition of her <i>Cuz I Love You</i> favorite “Jerome.”</p>
      <p>The singer and rapper is also up for three awards: Favorite Female Artist – Soul/R&amp;B, New Artist of the Year, and Favorite Song – Soul/R&amp;B for “Juice.” So far, she hasn’t taken home any awards, but the night’s still young and the awards are still being announced.</p>
      <p>Lizzo is one of many women dominating the stage at Sunday’s AMAs, joining the likes of <a href="http://spin.com/tag/Billie-Eilish/">Billie Eilish</a>, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8544107/toni-braxton-perform-2019-american-music-awards">Toni Braxton</a>,<a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/taylor-swift/"> Taylor Swift</a>, and <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/selena-gomez/">Selena Gomez</a>. Eilish has already been awarded the AMA for Favorite Artist – Alternative Rock, while others like <a href="http://spin.com/tag/Halsey/">Halsey</a> took home the trophy for Favorite Song – Pop/Rock for her song “Without Me.”</p>
