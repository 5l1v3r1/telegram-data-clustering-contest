      <h1>Deontay Wilder promises to knock Tyson Fury out ‘like I did the first time’ in rematch</h1>
      <h2>Following a 7th round knockout win over the tough Luis Ortiz, Wilder is setting his sights on a rematch with Tyson Fury.</h2>

      <p>Deontay Wilder did it again on Saturday night, knocking out his latest opponent Luis Ortiz with a brutal power shot that left the tough heavyweight senseless on the canvas in the 7th round of their WBC championship fight <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/24/20980003/knockout-watch-deontay-wilder-vs-luis-ortiz-2-full-fight-video-highlights-fox-ppv-ufc-fury-boxing">(watch the finish here).</a> During the post-fight press conference, Wilder had a lot to say about the performance, Ortiz’s skills, and how he was the only heavyweight out there challenging himself.</p>
      <p>”The fight lived up to the hype,” Wilder said. “Ortiz, you gotta take your hats off to him. He’s definitely one of the most dangerous men in the heavyweight division, as I always say, that’s why all these other heavyweights do not wanna fight him. And he proved that tonight.”</p>
      <p>Wilder seemed unconcerned about the fact that he was behind on all three judges’ scorecards when he put Ortiz down for the count.</p>
      <p>”My statement, and I said, these guys gotta be perfect for 12 rounds, I only have to be perfect for 2 seconds. It’s legit, I proved that tonight as well. What else can I say? We still undefeated, we still have our belt. And now we move onto the next phase and next chapter of my life. I’m looking to be the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. One champion, one face, one name. I’m on the pursuit of that, and I’m getting closer and closer each and every time.”</p>
      <p>He also responded to Tyson Fury’s coach Ben Davison, who said he saw holes in Wilder’s performance. The two fought to a draw back in December of 2018 which saw Fury somehow survive one of the biggest knockdowns in recent boxing history.</p>
      <p>”I hope he took notes and carries it back to this camp, ‘cuz I’m going to knock Fury out like I did the first time,” Deontay declared. “If they were so sure about certain things and they seen so much, [Fury] would have taken the rematch immediately.”</p>

      <p>”I’m not around here running around doing a hundred thousand things. I was the one that demanded a rematch as soon as possible, especially when it was a controversial decision. I’m the one fighting the top, the best of the best in the division. I don’t see no other fighters risking any fights. Last time I checked, Fury only had two big fights on his resume and that’s a win against Klitschko and a knockout against me. And the last two were against up and coming fighters.”</p>
      <p>”Look at me, I’m putting my title on the line each and every time and I’m only getting better with the timing and setting up these fighters,” Wilder continued. “So come February I hope they’re ready because I’m ready. I’m in great shape. This is going to be a quick turnaround for me. I haven’t done this since the beginning of my career. And this is only going to make me better, fighting the opposition that I’m fighting, doing it often, and getting ready to go back in there February again. So I wish those guys good luck, I hope [Fury’s trainer] took a lot of notes because I’m ready.”</p>
      <p>As Wilder said, a big money rematch with Tyson Fury is currently penciled in for February. But until the contracts are signed, we wouldn’t be so sure it’s going to happen. Deontay mentioned Fury doing a hundred thousand things and he wasn’t kidding. Fury has spent the last month wrestling for the WWE in Saudi Arabia and recording a Christmas song with Robbie Williams. There’s also been footage of him <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/10/20958550/video-15-minutes-of-tyson-fury-working-his-sprawlnbrawl-with-darren-till">training MMA with Darren Till,</a> and Fury hasn’t been shy about declaring he <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/15/20967303/tyson-fury-details-plans-to-train-conor-mcgregor-for-mma-crossover-till-mma-wilder-ufc-boxing-espn">plans of busting down the cage door soon.</a></p>

      <p>Considering how hard Deontay Wilder hit him in their first fight, we wouldn’t be surprised if Fury finds other things to do rather than face “The Bronze Bomber” again. But for now we just have to cross our fingers and hope the current plan goes forward, and that gives us a red hot fight in the cold depths of February.</p>
      <p><b>*Update* </b>Here’s Tyson Fury’s response:</p>
