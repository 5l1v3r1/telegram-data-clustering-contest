      <h4>James Azania, Lokoja</h4>
      <p>A former member of the National Assembly that represented the Yagba Federal Constituency at the lower chamber, Hon. Karimi Sunday Steve, has withdrawn his membership from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>
      <p>Karimi, a member of the House of Representatives between 2011 and 2019, has however not indicated what party he will be pitching tent with, though speculation is rife that he may seek membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>Karimi, who once served as the (Kogi) State Deputy Chairman of the party, in a statement signed by him, said that the withdrawal of his membership of the PDP is with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>The former lawmaker defected from the PDP to the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), under which platform he won the House of Representatives seat in 2011, but later returned to the PDP, from where he won a return to the National Assembly, in 2015.</p>

      <p>He aspired for election into the Senate in 2019, but was disqualified alongside others from contesting the primary by the PDP.</p>
      <p>Karin, in a statement, said that he will hand over his membership card to his Ward exco after which he will make public his decision on his political future.</p>
      <p>There are however strong indication that he may be joining the APC, which was formed by a coalition of the ACN and three other legacy parties.</p>
