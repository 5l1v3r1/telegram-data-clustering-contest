      <h1>Man dies in Dublin shooting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:45:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/newsroom-user" target="_blank">Newsroom</a></address>
      <p>A young man in his twenties has died after being shot in the chest in Dublin this evening.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to Beaumont Hospital with critical injuries after Gardai and Paramedics rushed to the scene on Clonshaugh Avenue shortly after 5pm.</p>
      <p>The scene of the shooting remains sealed off and an incident room has been set up at Coolock Garda station.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan has issued a statement condemning the attack and urging anyone with information to come forward to Garda.</p>
      <p>Local Labour Senator Aodhán O'Riordáin says it's totally unacceptable, and he's calling on Minister Flanagan to take swift action to get to grips with what he's described as the continuing cycle of violence in the city.</p>
