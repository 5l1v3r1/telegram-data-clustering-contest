      <p>KETTERING — One person is in the hospital after an SUV fleeing a traffic stop flipped over in the 200 block of Canterbury Drive, according to Kettering Police Department Sgt. Andrew DiSalvo. </p>
      <p>DiSalvo said that officers saw the vehicle traveling at high speed down Far Hill Avenue, estimated reaching 70-80 mph, then turning onto Canterbury Drive, striking the curb, and flipping the vehicle over onto its top. </p>
      <p>The incident was reported around 2:54 a.m.</p>
      <p>Four people were in the SUV, DiSalvo said, but all injuries were minor. </p>
      <p>The driver fled from the crash on foot, but was caught about a block away.</p>
      <p>Alcohol was likely a factor along with speed, DiSalvo said, and potential charges for the driver include OVI and reckless operation. </p>
