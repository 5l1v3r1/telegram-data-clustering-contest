      <p>Another man from Northern Ireland, 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, is facing extradition proceedings for the same charges and appeared in court in Dublin on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned until Dec 12.</p>
      <p>Three other people have also been arrested, questioned and released on bail as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>Essex Police detectives last month said they wanted to speak to two brothers - also from Northern Ireland - about the case and urged them to hand themselves in.</p>

      <p>Many of the victims were from impoverished central Vietnam, where the main source of income is from fishing, farming or factory work.</p>
      <p>Many families took on thousands of dollars of debt to send their children to Britain, in the hope they would land good jobs and send money back to pay off the loans.</p>
      <p>The incident has laid bare the dangers of illegal migration in Britain, where Vietnamese nationals have often found work in nail bars or illegal cannabis farms.</p>
