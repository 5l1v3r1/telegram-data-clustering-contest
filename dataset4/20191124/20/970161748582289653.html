      <p>His Dark Materials got a surprise book crossover in the latest episode, with the sudden cameo appearance of a familiar face from Harry Potter.</p>
      <p>Harry Melling, known to most as Harry’s annoyingly stuck-up cousin Dudley Dursley, has landed a new role in the other-worldly fantasy epic, appearing as the snivelling Sysselman in the North.</p>
      <p>Turns out, Sysselman might be as much of a pain as Dudley was, going head-to-head with Lee Scoresby (Lin Manuel Miranda) after holding great white Bear Iorek Byrnison captive after hiding his armour.</p>

      <p>Held under the thumb of the Magisterium, Sysselman refuses to help Scoresby, warning him not to cross the mysterious overpowering government that controls the land.</p>
      <p>The policeman even draws a gun on Scoresby to forewarn him not to cross his ruling…but just like Dudley, things don’t always go his way.</p>

      <p>Later on in the episode, as Lyra (Dafne Keen) reveals to Iorek where his precious armour is being hidden, Sysselman and his squad are forced to head to the town centre as the bear goes on the rampage in order to find it.</p>
      <p>As everyone around him is thrown around the street, Iorek turns his attention on Sysselman, knocking his gun out of his hand and leaving him cowering in fear for his life underfoot.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, Lyra and Scoresby are able to talk Iorek down from killing him, and he was left with a bruised ego – but very much alive.</p>
      <p>The brief visit to the series comes as Lyra’s mission in The North results in Bear Iorek and troublesome aeronaut Scoresby teaming up on their mission to help the Gyptians find the missing children taken by the Gobblers.</p>
      <p>With Iorek in tow, the team are building an army – but the conniving Miss Coulter (Ruth Wilson) isn’t far behind, recruiting a bear by the name of Iofer for the Magisterium.</p>
      <p>It seems that everyone’s preparing for war… and it could be getting ugly.</p>
