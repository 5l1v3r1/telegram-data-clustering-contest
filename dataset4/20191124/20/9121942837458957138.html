      <p>BETHEL, Alaska (AP) — Southwest Alaska’s Mulchatna Caribou herd has decreased to less than half its numbers, leaving wildlife officials with suspicions but no clear answers.</p>
      <p>KYUK-AM reported there were more than 27,000 Mulchatna Caribou three years ago and the figure is now only 13,500.</p>
      <p>The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says causes could include the animals trampling their food, heavy predation from wolves and over-hunting by humans.</p>
      <p>Officials say the caribou are roaming more in their western range near the Kuskokwim River and Bristol Bay region, an area with more communities than in the eastern range.</p>
      <p>Fish and game officials say surveys indicate more people are hunting caribou than suggested by the 238 animals listed in 2018 harvest reports.</p>
      <p>State and federal managers plan to respond with restrictions to conserve the population.</p>
