      <h1>Meet the order of Irish nuns invited to appear on Britain's Got Talent</h1>
      <h2>So far the Poor Clares of Nuns’ Island in Galway are resisting invitations to appear and sing in front of millions of viewers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:01:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/louise-roseingrave/" target="_blank">Louise Roseingrave</a></address>
      <p>An order of Irish nuns has caught the eye of a top <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/britains-got-talent">Britain’s Got Talent</a> scout - who has invited them to perform on the show.</p>
      <p>But so far the Poor Clares of Nuns’ Island in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/galway">Galway</a> are resisting invitations to appear and sing in front of millions of viewers.</p>
      <p>The musical sisters released a song last month, Calm The Soul, which has clocked up more than 50,000 views online.</p>
      <p>The nuns are tickled by the invitation to appear on TV, but feel an appearance might be counter-productive to their cause.</p>
      <p>Sr Colette, Abbess of the Poor Clare Monastery, said: “A researcher from the show has been in touch a number of times asking us to perform ‘Calm the Soul.’</p>

      <p>“We are thrilled by the invite of course but feel the message of the song might get lost somehow.”</p>
      <p>Their song arose from the success of their best-selling book Calm The Soul. Many people were touched by the message of a poem which appeared in the book and this prompted the sisters to put it to music.</p>
      <p>Sr Colette continued: “We don’t watch a lot of television so we wouldn’t be following the X-Factor and other shows like that on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>“We have seen a few highlights though including Fr. Ray Kelly singing the REM song Everybody Hurts.</p>
      <p>“Somebody also recommended that episode where Susan Boyle’s performance stunned the judges and that was lovely to watch,” Sr Colette said.</p>
      <p>The Order of Poor Clares is an enclosed, contemplative community of sisters whose foundation is based on a vision of poverty, humility and simplicity.</p>
      <p>The order has had a presence in Galway since 1642.</p>
      <p>The nuns’ daily routine includes rising at midnight for prayer, adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and music.</p>
      <p>They are delighted the song is reaching a wider audience with its message of peace and personal consolation.</p>
      <p>Sr Colette added: “As a community, we are gifted musically and love to try new stuff. Two sisters did singing lessons before they entered. Another sister who plays the guitar was a Mary Black wannabe when she was a teenager but there aren’t any divas among us really.</p>
      <p>“We see any gifts that we have as given to us by God for others and also that any particular sister’s gift is everybody else’s gift too.”</p>
      <p>The sisters have big hopes that the song will continue to reach a wider audience and provide comfort to people who are struggling.</p>
      <p>Sr Colette said: “We would hope that the song will give those who hear it a lift and maybe encourage those who have given up on God to renew the connection.”</p>
      <p>Their prayers have been answered as Sr. Consilio Fitzgerald, founder of the Cuan Mhuire addiction treatment centres, is making the song part of the recovery program.</p>
      <p>Sr. Consilio said: “There is a beautiful healing message there. Some of the people we work with have found it to be deeply moving and comforting. I think that this song will become part of our program for many years to come.”</p>
