      <h1>The Steelers Have Benched QB Mason Rudolph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:00:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>November has been a rough month for Mason Rudolph. First, he got his helmet swung at him by an angry Myles Garrett. Now, he’s been benched.</p>
      <p>The Steelers pulled the plug on Rudolph in the second half of today’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Rudolph was just 8-for-16 for 85 yards and an interception before getting pulled.</p>
      <p>Devlin Hodges replaced Rudolph.</p>

      <p>Sure enough, what did Hodges do as soon as he got in? Connect with James Washington on a 79-yard touchdown pass.</p>
      <p>That’s the second career touchdown pass for the rookie out of Samford.</p>

      <p>Pittsburgh leads the lowly Bengals 10-7 now in the third quarter. If the Steelers hold on and win, you have to think Hodges has a good chance at starting next week.</p>
      <p>We’ll see how the rest of the afternoon goes.</p>
