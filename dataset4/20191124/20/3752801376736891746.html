      <p>Police are appealing for information after a video of a dead body and people rejoicing next to it in Gugulethu was circulated on social media.</p>
      <p>One of the captions to the video on Twitter was: "One of the most notorious gangsters died and the community of Gugulethu is rejoicing. The man was known as Ninja, mercy was not part of his mondus operandi." </p>
      <p>A blanket can be seen over the body and an ambulance nearby.</p>
      <p>People can be seen clapping, and singing.</p>
      <p>Loosely translated their song is: ""Satan has been shamed. God has agreed (rejoicing). Ninja is dead". </p>
      <p>They also sing "Halala", which is usually associated with a victory or achievement.</p>
