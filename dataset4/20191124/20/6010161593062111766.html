      <p>The Sega Genesis Mini launched in September <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/04/sega-genesis-mini-games-all-42/">with 42 pre-installed games</a>. The mini console features sliders that push down the cartridge slot cover to “recreate” the original console’s buttons of yesteryear. It also has four quick save slots, an HDMI output is located on the back, supports 720p resolution, and is powered by microUSB. The USB-based controllers come standard with the Fighting Pad 6B.</p>
