      <blockquote>2019, God gave me a house.<br/>Not rented. My own home.<br/>4bedroom. With a garden. In England.<br/><br/>For a boy that only came to UK with 2travelling bags in 2016, I’m in tears.<br/><br/>My prayer for everyone that follows me or sees this is that God will grant all your heart’s greatest desires<br/><br/>And to those asking-<br/>The interiors were totally all designed by me. The choice of the colours, furniture, paints and wallpapers were all picked by me.<br/><br/>The walls were all white when the house was sold. I felt it was a little boring and it would be nice to spice things a little.<br/><br/>And all this happened since September 2019. But I’ve had a few things going on in my life to sort and a major exam in October also- which I just passed last week.<br/><br/>1. I’m not married.<br/>2. People’s responsibilities differ.<br/>3. I’ve had a culture of saving between 500-1000£ every month from my earnings for about 3years.<br/>4. It was a plan I had and worked towards seeing friends who achieved same.<br/><br/>That’s the simplified explanation.<br/><br/>I pray that this goodnews encourages someone to not give up and keep trying. Your dreams are valid.</blockquote>
