      <p>Running back Andrew Harris made Canadian Football League history and ended the Winnipeg Blue Bombers championship drought on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Winnipeg native had a rushing and a receiving touchdown as the Blue Bombers stunned the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 in the 107th Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>Harris rushed for 134 yards and caught six passes for 35 yards to become the first player ever to be named the game's top player and best Canadian.</p>
      <p>He is the first Canadian to be named the Grey Cup's most valuable player since the legendary Russ Jackson of the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1969.</p>
      <p>Harris's awards are not without controversy. He served a two-game suspension for a positive drug test earlier in the season. That led to his being snubbed in voting for the league's individual honours despite leading the CFL in rushing for a third straight season.</p>
      <p>The Blue Bombers defence also helped in the victory, forcing seven turnovers and earning six sacks.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg had not won a Grey Cup title since 1990. The second longest drought belongs to the Tiger-Cats, whose last title came in 1999.</p>
      <p>Hamilton suffered its 16th straight loss at McMahon Stadium, the previous 15 coming against the hometown Calgary Stampeders.</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats came in as the solid favourite after a dominant 2019 season. The Ticats posted a CFL-best 15-3 regular-season mark, a single-season franchise record, to take first in the East Division.</p>
      <p>Wide receiver Brandon Banks had been a critical part of Hamilton's offence all season. He was named the CFL's most outstanding player on Thursday at the league's annual awards ceremony.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for the Tiger-Cats, Banks saw only one play in the second half. He was injured when Blue Bombers defensive back Mike Jones landed a big hit on the 31-year-old receiver early in the third quarter. The league's leading receiver left the game with a lower-body injury and wouldn't return.</p>
