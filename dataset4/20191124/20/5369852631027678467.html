      <p>FURY ROAD PREVAILED in today’s ”Monksfield” Novice Hurdle at Navan. </p>
      <p>Gordon Elliot’s horse justified its favourite status with a comfortable 18th-length win.</p>
      <p>Ridden by Davy Russell, the path to victory was made easier after the much-fancied Abacadabras had to withdraw prior to the race.</p>
      <p>“It was straightforward, as it should have been, but he’s a nice horse and is better than that form,” Elliot <a href="https://www.racingtv.com/news/fury-road-eases-to-monksfield-victory">told Racing TV afterwards</a>.</p>
      <p>“He could step right out to three miles if we wanted, and he jumps very well.</p>
      <p>“He could go for the three-mile race at Limerick or the Lawlor’s race at Naas. He’s a big, staying horse.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there was success for Henry de Bromhead and Chris’s Dream in the Ladbrokes Troytown Handicap Chase, claiming the €59,000 prize ahead of Fitzhenry and Portmore Lough in second and third respectively.</p>
      <p>“Brian [Acheson, owner] suggested this race, and it made a lot of sense. Robbie was brilliant on him, and he’s a very good horse,” De Bromhead t<a href="https://www.racingtv.com/news/chris-s-dream-is-convincing-troytown-winner">old Racing TV</a>.</p>
      <p>“His form tailed off a bit last season, so we’ll have to watch that, and it seems he doesn’t want too much racing. We went to Aintree full of confidence, and he was well beaten — then he ran no sort of race at Punchestown.</p>
      <p>“Christmas will probably come too soon, so maybe we will look at something like the Thyestes — but to be honest, I haven’t really looked beyond today.”</p>
