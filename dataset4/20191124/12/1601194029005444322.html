      <p>Throughout his time as a member of the WWE backstage authorities, Triple H has been a mentor to more than just a few WWE Superstars. Over the course of his time managing NXT, The Game has become a face that most new Superstars are familiar with, as he is known to take time out of his day to guide them. Finn Balor is no exception to this rule.</p>
      <p>Before <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt-takeover">NXT TakeOver: WarGames</a> got underway, Triple revealed that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/finn-balor">Finn Balor</a> confided in him about how he was feeling about returning to the first TakeOver event he has been a part of since 2016 (excluding NXT UK TakeOvers).</p>

      <h3>WWE Superstar Finn Balor confides in Triple H</h3>
      <p>As the longest-reigning NXT Champion ever, returning to NXT was like returning home for Finn Balor. Despite being away for a long time, he was able to create an almost immediate impact on NXT by turning heel extremely quickly.</p>
      <p>NXT TakeOver: WarGames was the first TakeOver event that Balor was to be a part of since 2016 when he was called up to the main roster. Naturally, he was extremely nervous, and according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/WrestlingInc/status/1198450826878078976?s=20">report</a> by Wrestling Inc, Triple H said that Balor told him that this was the most nervous that he had ever been in years.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for him, his match went well and he was able to take out Matt Riddle with a 1916 DDT for the win.</p>
