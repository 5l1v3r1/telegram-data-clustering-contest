      <p>Doha: To strengthen their competitive position in the downstream sector, Qatar Petroleum announced the integration of SEEF Limited’s (SEEF) operations into Qatar Petroleum before the end of the second quarter of 2020. As a result of this integration, QP Operations (Refining) will be fully operating SEEF’s facilities.</p>
      <p>“This integration is the natural next step of our acquisition of SEEF interests on December 31, 2018, which provided QP with full ownership of SEEF. This step will allow us to build world-class operations by extracting synergies between QP refining operations and SEEF, and to strengthen our resources, talents and capabilities,” a statement from QP said.</p>
      <p>“This integration marks another step towards achieving Qatar Petroleum’s vision to become one of the best national oil companies in the world, and to ensure the reinforcement of Qatar’s continued and sustainable economic growth,” it added.</p>
