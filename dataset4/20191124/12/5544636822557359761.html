      <p>The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has transferred the new Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edgal Imohimi to Akwa Ibom state.</p>
      <p>Also, the Akwa Ibom police commissioner, Kenneth Ebrimson, is to assume duty in Ogun to replace Imohimi.</p>
      <p>This was contained in a police signal from the office of the Nigeria Police Force, on behalf of the Inspector General dated November 22.</p>
      <p>According to the signal, the posting as ordered by the Inspector General of Police is with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that on November 15 that Imohimi and Ebrimson had been posted to Ogun and Akwa Ibom respectively.</p>
      <p>But in a dramatic twist, the duo were swapped, less down a week after they resumed duty in Ogun and Akwa Ibom.</p>
      <p>Recall that Imohimi, less than 24 hours after he took charge of Ogun police command, ordered the officers in the state to resume to their original duty posts for a headcount.</p>
      <p>The CP also set up a complaint call centre with 10 hotlines through which the public can report any officer demanding money from them under any guise.</p>
