        <b>United Kingdom’s richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe has revealed that he will not buy Premier League giants Manchester United from their current owners the Glazers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/sir-jim-ratcliffe-buy-a-premier-league-club-for-billions-ill-never-be-the-dumb-money-8ts7k5mz3"><i>The Times</i></a>, Sir Ratcliffe said that he believes the club have “lost the plot” after poor investments on both players and managers.</p>
      <p>“They [Manchester United] are in quite a big pickle as a business,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“They haven’t got the manager selection right, haven’t bought well. They have been the dumb money, which you see with players like Fred.”</p>
      <p>“We won’t look elsewhere until we have had a good run here [at OGC Nice, the Ligue 1 club he bought earlier this year]. We need to find out how to be successful before you ever want to write a big cheque. It’s quite difficult.”</p>
      <p>“Manchester United have spent an immense amount since Sir Alex Ferguson left and been poor, to put it mildly. Shockingly poor, to be honest,” Sir Ratcliffe explained further.</p>
      <p>“We have a different approach here [at Nice] to be moderately intelligent about it. Try to do it more grassroots, trying to locate young talent.”</p>
      <p>“Some clubs seem to have an ability to do that, Southampton, Lille. United have done it really poorly. They have lost the plot there somehow.”</p>
