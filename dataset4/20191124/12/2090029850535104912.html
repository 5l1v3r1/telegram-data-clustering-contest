      <p>The anti-Tacha fan, Alhaji Royz however got hold of the post, confirmed the address is him and warned anyone who tried anything funny would have themselves to blame. He wrote;</p>
      <blockquote>When I said I have never seen an intelligent Titan before, the others that I don’t know came at ,e to show they are unintelligent too.<br/><br/>But now they over reached. They want the smoke, they shall get the smoke. I’m not even tripping.<br/><br/>So i just heard one of the Titans I blocked put up my address for other Titans.<br/><br/>I just wanna say that’s my real address, and whenever you are coming, you should come with a lot of back up. Cause i swear, niggas gon bleed.<br/><br/>You’ll see the difference between twitter and real life.<br/><br/>I’ll also make sure I have it on record so i can post it back here to let y’all know not to fuck wrong with me.</blockquote>
