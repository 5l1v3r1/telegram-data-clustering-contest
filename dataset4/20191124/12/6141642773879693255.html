      <p>A blind border collie is looking for a new home with his best friend — who acts as his guide dog.</p>
      <p>Nine-year-old border collies Bess and Roy were found tied up in the woods in Cumbria and taken to the RSPCA.</p>
      <p>The charity believes they were previously working collies on a farm but were abandoned when their owner could no longer take care of them.</p>

      <p>RSPCA Westmorland branch manager Christine Lowe said: “They are both lovely, friendly, happy dogs who deserve a home where they’ll get all of the affection they crave as they come into their senior years.”</p>
      <p>The pair are up for adoption under the branch’s elderly animal rehoming scheme, which means anyone who takes them on will receive ongoing financial assistance with their vet bills.</p>
      <p>They have never lived in a domestic environment and are not house-trained, having lived outside for most of their lives.</p>

      <p>They would be best suited in a home with no cats but would be happy living with a family with older children.</p>
      <p>Ms Lowe said: “They need a home where they can live out their days in comfort with someone who understands their unique needs.”</p>
