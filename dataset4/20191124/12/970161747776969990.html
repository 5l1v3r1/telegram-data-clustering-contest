      <p>It turns out the more expensive puds aren’t that good after all.</p>
      <p>Supermarket chain Aldi’s £12.99 Christmas pudding has been crowned the country’s best after it beat the likes of Harrods, Selfridges, Fortnum &amp; Mason and Waitrose in a taste test carried out by consumer magazine Which?</p>
      <p>How did they find the best pudding, you ask? Which? blind-tested 13 different Christmas puddings and judged them all on taste, texture, aroma and appearance.</p>
      <p>The 800g Aldi Specially Selected Exquisite Vintage Pudding scored an extremely impressive 76%, beating all the other Crimbo desserts to reach the top spot.</p>
      <p>Available in all Aldi stores from 5 December, the judging panel said that the winner was packed with high-quality fruits and nuts. They were also randomly fans of the red cherries.</p>
      <p>Asda came in second place, followed by the likes of M&amp;S in third, Waitrose in fourth and Lidl in fifth.</p>

      <p>Selfridges traditional Christmas pudding (the highest priced on the list at £16) nabbed eighth place whilst supermarket Iceland ranked the lowest in thirteenth place.</p>

      <p>Mega supermarket Tesco also received a poor score coming in at second to last place with a taste score of just 56=%.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the results Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine said: ‘It’s always interesting to see the challenger supermarkets taking on the big four, and in our expert taste test Aldi delivered a Christmas pudding that really impressed.’</p>
      <p>Julie Ashfield, managing director of buying and winner at Aldi, said: ‘We’re thrilled that our luxury Specially Selected Exquisite Vintage Pudding has been awarded a Which? Best Buy, demonstrating once again that great-tasting, exceptional quality products do not have to come at a premium price.’</p>
      <p>So this basically means forking out a small fortune on a posh pudding might not be worth it after all.</p>
