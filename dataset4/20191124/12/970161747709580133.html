      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> midfielder Eric Dier says he is delighted to be working under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> after the Portuguese coach replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> in charge of the north London club.</p>
      <p>Spurs had made a worrying start to the season, sitting in 14th place – 11 points adrift of the top four – when Pochettino was dismissed on Tuesday evening, with Mourinho swiftly announced as his successor the following morning.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had just three training sessions before making his bow as Tottenham manager on Saturday, securing a 3-2 victory away to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> – their first away win in the Premier League since January.</p>

      <p>One of his most notable changes was moving Dier back into the midfield to sit and protect the defence and the side gave an assured display for the first hour before conceding twice late on.</p>

      <p>While Dier was full of praise for Pochettino – who gave him his debut and moulded him into a midfielder – if someone had to replace the Argentine he’s glad it was three-time Premier League title winner Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘I’m very happy that it’s him [Mourinho]. Obviously with my connection to Portugal when I was younger,’ Dier, who came through the academy at Sporting Lisbon, told <i>ESPN</i> after beating West Ham.</p>
      <p>‘I grew up watching him coach great teams and winning the biggest titles in football. For me, it’s very special to be able to play for him.</p>
      <p>‘We’re very lucky to have played for Pochettino and now for Mourinho. I feel very lucky to be able to have played for these two managers.’</p>

      <p>Dier had only started two Premier League matches before Mourinho’s arrival, the first in midfield in October’s 3-0 defeat to Brighton and the second at centre-back in Pochettino’s final game, a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was praised for his back-to-basics approach against West Ham, reverting to a 4-2-3-1 formation that saw Spurs’ front three all get on the scoresheet while Dele Alli, playing as a No.10, looked back to his best.</p>
