      <p><b>SEOUL – </b>A former member of South Korea’s top K-pop girl group was found dead Sunday, the country’s Yonhap news agency reported citing police.</p>
      <p>The body of Goo Hara, 28, was discovered at her home in southern Seoul, Yonhap said.</p>
      <p>Police were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Goo, better known as Hara in other parts of Asia, had spoken out against cyberbullying. In June, a month after she was found unconscious at her home and hospitalized, she said it was difficult to overcome depression and pleaded for positive comment on social media.</p>
      <p>She debuted with the five-member Kara in 2008. It was one of the early girl groups that helped fan the global K-pop wave, building large fan bases in Japan, China and other countries.</p>
