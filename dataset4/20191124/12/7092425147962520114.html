        <b>Billie Eilish has offered a response to those who booed her after her appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show in the US.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The breakout singer opened up about dealing with fame at her young age after being nominated for a number of Grammy awards, breaking records in the process.</p>
      <p>After her appearance, the 17-year-old took to Instagram on Saturday morning to explain why a group of people asking for autographs booed her as she walked away from them.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsuXJ7i2FE">video</a> of the incident shows Eilish engaging with fans after the Jimmy Kimmel show, but walks away from a group and refused to sign autographs.</p>
      <p>The teen sensation offered her response and reasoning for her actions on Instagram.</p>

      <p>She said: "The only reason I'm making this video is that I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened.</p>
      <p>"Because if you watch the video it looks like I'm walking by a bunch of fans and completely ignoring them and not saying 'Hi' to them, which is not what happened.</p>
      <p>"I started to walk away because I realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person.</p>
      <p>"I walked over there only to say Hi, only to hug people and I got pictures of me shoved into my f**king face. I got no love whatsoever, so I left and then I got booed and (got) called a little b**ch and got told I was going to lose my Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p>"The fact that people can switch up like that... damn. They wait outside for you and then immediately they don't get what they want and they boo you and f**king curse at you. I'm like, 'Bro, I'm 17.'"</p>
      <p>Eilish finished her response by saying: "To the grown men that booed me and called me a 'little b**ch,' I hope the best for you. I hope you find someone else that you use to make money off of and belittle. All the best. Love you paparazzi."</p>
