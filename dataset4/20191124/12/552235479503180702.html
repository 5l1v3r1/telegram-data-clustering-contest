      <h2>Thrilled Laura Boyd announced the amazing news in a Twitter post today - 10 years after she was first diagnosed with leukaemia.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:30:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>A Scots TV reporter's dream of becoming a mum has come after she welcomed her daughter 10 years after being diagnosed with cancer.</p>
      <p>STV's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/stv-star-set-become-mother-20134759">Laura Boyd</a> lives life to the full interviewing Hollywood megastars for the broadcaster while battling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">leukemia</a> .</p>
      <p>But the 38-year-old entertainment journalist and her husband feared the disease meant they may never be parents.</p>
      <p>Those fears are now a thing of the past thanks to one of Laura's family members who acted as a surrogate for the couple and yesterday gave birth to little Penelope.</p>
      <p>The tot was delivered at 4.25am and weighs a healthy 7lb 8oz.</p>
      <p>Announcing the news on Twitter, Laura said: "She is our heart. Our true miracle. [Our surrogate] was incredible and we will never be able to thank her enough.</p>
      <p>"She’s our hero. Let the most incredible journey begin."</p>

      <p>Laura was diagnosed with leukaemia in September 2009 after weeks of feeling unwell with what she suspected was flu.</p>
      <p>She now takes powerful medication every day to help control her chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), with September 17 this year marking a decade since her diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Marking the exact anniversary of her diagnosis with a routine appointment at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/enterprising-youngsters-raise-cash-cancer-18668145">Beatson Cancer Centre</a> , doctors told her that her cancer remains under control.</p>

      <p>Medics previously advised Laura that, before falling pregnant, she would need to stop taking her life-saving medication and hope the cancer in her body remained stable.</p>
      <p>She stopped taking the drugs and was closely monitored by her medical team. But the results were not as hoped.</p>
      <p>Laura previously told the Record: “The cancerous cells increased at a worrying rate and I was told that, if I got pregnant, it could get to the stage where a decision would have to be made between saving my life and the baby’s.</p>
      <p>“My husband and I were devastated. I felt that not only had cancer already zapped me of energy and possibly time, it had now also robbed me of the chance of having a little one.”</p>
      <p>As they tried to come to terms with their heartache, a family member offered to carry their baby for them.</p>
      <p>Laura added: “It was amazing. She offered to give us the most incredible gift. We will never be able to thank her enough.</p>
      <p>Congratulations Laura!</p>
