        <b>In accordance with the Intervention Plan presented on Tuesday by the government, by 25 September more than 1,200 warning signs had been placed in the surroundings of 150 quarries in a critical situation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Intervention Plan results from a survey by the Mining Development Company after the accident of 19 November 2018, when a section of a road between Borba and Vila Viçosa collapsed, which killed five people.</p>
      <p>A total of 1,253 signs were installed at a cost of around €196,000.</p>
      <p>The municipality of Vila Viçosa (Évora district) had the largest number of quarries in need of signage in the surrounding area (19), followed by the municipalities of Alcobaça (Leiria district), Borba (Évora) and Ponte de Lima (Viana do Castelo), with 13 quarries each.</p>
      <p>Mondim de Basto and Penafiel then appeared, with eight quarries each.</p>
      <p>Quarries have to signal the danger of fronts steeper than the natural slope or steeper elevation levels, including the creation of safety zones, in addition to signalling the danger of access to the quarries, the danger of deep lagoons, where accidents may occur due to drowning and to signal the danger of collapse or subsidence of communication routes, including traffic bans and installation of protection systems.</p>
      <p>Of these 150 quarries, 36 are for marble exploration, 34 granite, 19 sand and clays and 19 ornamental granite, ten quarries for ornamental limestone, six to schist and slate, while another 26 for other unspecified ores.</p>
      <p>The Intervention Plan identified 191 quarries in critical situation(including the 150 requiring signalling).</p>
      <p>According to data from the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology, in 2018 quarries produced around 48 million tonnes, with a production value of approximately €350 million, in an activity that employs 5,389 workers.</p>
