        <b>Olly Croft, founder of the British Darts Organisation (BDO), passed away on Saturday at the age of 90-years-old, and the darts world has reacted with immense gratitude for what he did for the sport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Croft was in charge of the sport as it soared to its height of popularity in the 1980s, with players including Eric Bristow, Jocky Wilson, John Lowe and Bobby George becoming household names.</p>
      <p>He founded the BDO in 1973 and remained on its board of directors until he was voted off in 2011, having been the most influential figure in the organisation throughout his tenure.</p>
      <p>The pioneer in darts administration was the honorary president of the World Darts Federation (WDF) and ushered in the first WDF <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/world-cup/">World Cup</a> in 1977.</p>
      <p>A somewhat decisive figure, his methods of running the BDO brought about the split in darts as a number of top players left to create the World Darts Council, now the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC), in 1994.</p>

      <p>The split remains to this day, but even those who disagreed with some of his decisions recognise just how important he is to the history of darts as messages of respect poured in after his death.</p>
      <h3>BDO statement on death of Olly Croft</h3>
      <p>‘It is with great sadness that the British Darts Organisation has to report the passing of its founder Oliver Croft OBE who passed away earlier today at the age of 90.</p>
      <p>‘Oliver or Olly as he was known founded the British Darts Organisation in 1973 and spent nearly four decades in charge, he will be remembered as one of the most influential men in world darts.</p>
      <p>‘The British Darts Organisation would like to offer its sincere condolences to Olly’s family.</p>
      <p>‘Rest in peace</p>
      <p>‘Oliver Croft OBE 17th November 1929 – 23rd November 2019’</p>
      <p>PDC chairman Barry Hearn wrote: ‘Whilst our views may not have always aligned, you cannot overlook his influence on the sport.</p>
      <p>‘The BDO played a huge role in darts’ development and Olly was at the heart of that.’</p>
      <p>Three-time BDO world champion John Lowe wrote: ‘Yesterday one of the most influential people the sport of darts has ever known passed away at the age of 90. Oliver Albert Croft, known to us all as Olly Croft, I like to think his involvement started in earnest at the National Darts Association of Great Britain Finals at the Danesmoor WMC, Clay Cross, in 1973.</p>
      <p>‘Olly was with the Rising Star team from Peckham, London, I was a spectator and knew little about the organisations of the sport.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>I do remember, though, hearing Olly say to Willie Etherington and Tony Bell, I will make this game truly national. True to his word the British Darts Organisation was formed a few weeks later.<br/>I joined the Super League, then playing county and eventually, when Olly and his team formed international darts, played for England from 1974 till 1994. I played in almost every BDO event it was possible to enter.</p>
      <p>‘I did reap major rewards, winning World Championships, World Cups, British Opens, World Masters, European Cups and more. Of course, doing the first 9-darts game on television in 1984 made a massive difference to my life and more so my immortality. Make no mistake, Olly Croft made this possible.</p>
      <p>‘Sadly the split came in 1994 and a lot of animosity with it, some nasty words and more so nasty actions took place. It was not a good time for the sport, but things did get better for the betterment of all.</p>
      <p>‘Not it’s time to remember a man who dedicated his life to the sport of darts, Oliver Albert Croft, thank you for what you gave to others, and with it my respect. RIP.’</p>
      <p>The WDF posted a statement which read: ‘Olly was a great inspiration to all of us whose vision and drive was the catalyst that put darts where it is today. Rest in peace Olly. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family.’</p>

      <p>Two-time world finalist Bobby George tweeted: ‘RIP Olly Croft OBE…GOD as I used to call you thank you for what you did for the sport of Darts and us all. Love the George’s!’</p>

      <p>1983 world champion Keith Deller wrote: ‘It’s a very sad day for darts with the passing of Olly Croft. If it wasn’t for Olly myself and many other dart players would never of been able to fulfil our dreams of playing professional darts. Everyone in the BDO &amp; PDC owe a great debt to Olly..’</p>
