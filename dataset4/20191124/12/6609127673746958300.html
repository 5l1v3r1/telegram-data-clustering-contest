      <p>The prison warder bombarded her with so many calls from HMP Kilmarnock that she blocked the number.</p>
      <p>Pattie also sent barrages of texts to his ex every day - some abusing her and others begging her to get back together with him.</p>
      <p>Blayre claims his harrassment "took over [her] life" and she called cops and prison operators Serco to put a stop to it.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2OErElF">Sunday Mail</a>, her official complaint sparked an internal probe and Pattie is no longer working at the Kilmarnock nick.</p>
      <p>Blayre said: “It took over my life. I was afraid to go outside. He really thought he was above the law.</p>
      <p>“Once I had 70 missed calls from HMP Kilmarnock – I had to block the number.</p>

      <p>“In the end, I contacted the police because he wouldn’t leave me alone and his work didn’t seem to be able to do anything about it.”</p>
      <p>The pair met in April 2015, but Blayre claims her ex soon became “obsessive, manipulative, controlling and a pathological liar”.</p>
      <p>In one abusive voicemail message, Pattie said: “F***ing phone me. I’ve not f***ing messaged her. You’re f***ing leaving me here, it’s absolutely ridiculous. F***ing phone me.”</p>
      <p>At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court in September, he admitted engaging in conduct that placed Blayre in a state of fear or alarm between July 2017 and January 2019.</p>
      <p>He was later hit with a community payback order and ordered to complete 160 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Pattie was also give a two-year non-harassment order.</p>
      <p>A Serco spokesperson said: “This individual no longer works at HMP Kilmarnock.”</p>
