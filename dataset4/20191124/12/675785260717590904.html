      <h1>BBC Question Time: Tory activist who slammed Jeremy Corbyn speaks out</h1>
      <h2>Father-of-two Ryan Jacobsz, 36, from Hessle, East Yorkshire, said something 'clicked' in him after he went on the BBC show for the fourth time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:33:15+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom, Tom Kershaw</a></address>
      <p>A man who confronted Jeremy Corbyn over abuse and anti-Semitism has spoken out after it emerged he is a Tory activist who's been on Question Time four times.</p>
      <p>Ryan Jacobsz, 36, is a father-of-two who lives in Hessle, East Yorkshire and has canvassed for the Conservative Party after moving to the UK from South Africa.</p>
      <p>He confronted Mr Corbyn over his "nice old grandpa act" and the treatment of Jewish <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP Ruth Smeeth on a Question Time election special on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Ms Smeeth was heckled at the 2016 launch of a report into anti-Semitism by Marc Wadsworth who was later kicked out of the party.</p>
      <p>Mr Jacobsz interrupted the Labour leader's explanation of why he was seen talking to Mr Wadsworth, saying: "Watch the video!"</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/question-time-jeremy-corbyn-hessle-3570638">Hull Live,</a> he said he was planning to comment in a different way but he attacked the Labour leader when something "clicked" in him.</p>

      <p>He said: "I had planned a different question and prepped it up because it's a great experience on the night.</p>
      <p>"And then Corbyn went for this persona with this righteous guy attitude and at that point, something clicked within me."</p>
      <p>Mr Jacobsz was criticised by many online after it emerged he had appeared on the show several times.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/send/u21723349">BBC guidance on applying to be on Question Time</a> suggests audience members do not apply more than once in 10 years.</p>
      <p>It says: "If you have been in a QT audience within the past ten years we are delighted that you want to do it all over again, but please give others a chance and don't apply this time round."</p>

      <p>The MatesJacob <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account produced screenshots of the activist apparently speaking on Question Time in Peterborough, Scarborough and Lincoln since 2017.</p>
      <p>However, there is no rule against being a political activist and appearing on Question Time.</p>
      <p>The BBC said the audience was roughly equally split between Tory and Labour supporters, with a smaller number for each of the Lib Dems and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Jacobsz told Hull Live: "The difference with politics in this country [Britain] and my native South Africa, is that it is not a forgone conclusion who will win, so that's nice compared South Africa."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was also laughed at and booed by some audience members - who barracked him for racist comments and calling gay men "bum boys".</p>
      <p>And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson got a rough ride over her support for Tory austerity during the Coalition.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied to Mr Jacobsz saying: "Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately.</p>
      <p>"Nobody should suffer abuse and Ruth Smeeth and others have suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse.</p>
      <p>He added: "It was a Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered because she stood up in public life.</p>
      <p>"I simply say to you that bad behaviour, misogynism, racism in any form is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party, or in our society."</p>
      <p>The audience member asked again: "Why were you talking happily to that same heckler" and "why would Labour female MPs need protection at Labour Party conference?"</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "I've had many conversations with Ruth Smeeth since then," adding: "You don't know what was said between us."</p>
