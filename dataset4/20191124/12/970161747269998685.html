      <p>Grey’s Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff is going to bring the show back to its ‘sexy’ roots.</p>
      <p>The medical drama is returning for its 16th season in 2020, and according to Vernoff it will come back with a bang. So to speak.</p>
      <p>Grey’s was previously shifted forward to 8pm to make space for other shows but in another schedule switch up it will go back to its original 9pm slot.</p>
      <p>Vernoff said that the ‘different rules’ for a post-watershed programme will definitely apply to the new season, and fans are going to get the racier content of earlier seasons.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/krista-vernoff-greys-anatomy-fall-finale-season-3-station-19-crossovers-1202791781/">She told Deadline</a>: ‘There are different rules for a 9 PM show than there are for an 8 PM show, and we hope to take advantage of those rules.</p>
      <p>‘Grey’s was definitely allowed to be a sexier show when it was on at 9 o’clock. So we are excited by the change back to our original (Thursday) time slot.’</p>

      <p>She also spoke about the potential for a crossover with new 8pm drama Station 19, about a group of ridiculously good looking firefighters.</p>
      <p>‘With Station 19 airing at 8 o’clock and Grey’s Anatomy airing at 9 o’clock there are very organic opportunities for Grey’s Anatomy to, for example, inherit patients we see rescued on Station 19,’ she added.</p>

      <p>She added that the two shows being next to each other is ‘really exciting and opens up the storytelling’.</p>
      <p>Grey’s Anatomy has been running for an impressive 14 years now, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/06/greys-anatomy-isnt-going-anywhere-assures-abc-boss-10527557/">luckily for fans it’s not going any where</a>.</p>
      <p>ABC Entertainment Karey Burke recently said the network has no plans to cancel it.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, Burke explained: ‘We love them. They are as deep a part of the fabric of ABC as anyone and certainly it will be up to them whether or not they want to continue the show.</p>
      <p>‘I hope I’m watching with my grandchildren.’</p>
