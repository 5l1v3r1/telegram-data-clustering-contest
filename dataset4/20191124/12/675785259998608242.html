      <h1>Kim Kardashian compares her celebrity life struggles to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</h1>
      <h2>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star took time out of making an advert for Uber Eats to talk with Australia's The Project TV show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:46:51+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Kim Kardashian says she knows how it feels to be a member of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal family</a> as she compared her overexposed reality star life to that of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markel, the Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">The 39-year-old reality star</a> shot to fame after a sex tape went viral in 2007 preceding the launch of reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians later that same year.</p>
      <p>Now Kim - who has actively sought out fame at any cost - agrees herself and her famous siblings and parents are the only people in the world on a par with the Royal Family in terms of recognisability.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Australian entertainment show The Project, Kim drew parallels between her own life and that of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, 35,</a> and his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markel">38-year-old American wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.</a></p>

      <p>“I think everyone has their own journey and I think their journey is extremely personal with what his mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi,” Kimmy told Lisa Wilkinson.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone can know what that is like except for them,” Kim went on.</p>
      <p>“I think, as I’m older and i have kids, and what I would want for them, is just the safest place. I can definitely empathise with their need for having a secure safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it,” she continued.</p>

      <p>Kim then wanted to make it clear she wasn’t complaining about being in the spotlight herself.</p>
      <p>“I’m not one of those people that will complain and be like ‘I don’t have any privacy’ or ‘my life is so different’,” she said.</p>
      <p>Going on, she revealed her biggest struggle in life is being able to keep in touch with friends.</p>
      <p>“I think the hardest part is keeping up with my friends. I have the best friends I could ever have wished for and they’re all girls I grew up with. But you do have to put in work to maintain those relationships,” she said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Over the years, Kim has given fans and followers full access to her entire life - despite no one asking to see it.</p>
      <p>She has shared a sex tape she made with Ray J, home life with husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> and their four children, North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm, and fly on the wall footage for her reality shows alongside her siblings, mother Kris Jenner, and former step-father Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>More recently, Kim has appeared to attempt to make more of herself than being simply a product of a reality show, by studying law and campaigning for prison reform in America.</p>
      <p>There continues to be a threat she will one day become First Lady of America as her husband continues to tease he will run for President in 2024.</p>
