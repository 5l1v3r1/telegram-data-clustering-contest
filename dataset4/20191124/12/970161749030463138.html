      <p>A former lapdancer has claimed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> ‘motorboated’ her breasts during a party thrown by Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The woman, who gave evidence against Epstein under the name ‘Tiffany Doe’, alleged the Prince of York liked ‘curvy girls, like his ex-wife, Fergie’.</p>
      <p>She claims she was paid by convicted paedophile Epstein, who died in August this year, to attend the party and make sure Andrew was looked after.</p>
      <p>According to her, there were also several young women and girls attending the party, held in Epstein’s mansion, some of who were homeless, runaways, or the little sisters of strippers.</p>
      <p>She claims girls who ‘couldn’t look 18 or 19’ were kept upstairs in bedrooms during the night.</p>

      <p>The woman, now 47, told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ex-lapdancer-says-prince-andrew-20946791">The Mirror</a> Andrew had appeared in ‘good spirits’ during their meeting, stating that she ‘always thought’ he liked her breasts.</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘He leaned forward and put his face on them and blew a raspberry. I was shocked, but I laughed, thinking “Wow what was that?”</p>
      <p>‘He laughed, too. He’d never done it before and I thought, “It’s going to be a good night”. I guess being a prince gives you those privileges.’</p>
      <p>The former stripper stated that the duke had failed to remember the term for his actions, asking her if it was a ‘motor…something?’</p>
      <p>She described him as ‘quite awkward, quite clumsy’, and alleged that he had also told her she should be in ‘a magazine for big-breasted women’.</p>
      <p>The woman said she saw him at parties a ‘couple of times a year’, adding: ‘He would hold my hands, put his arm around my waist, stroke my cheek.</p>

      <p>‘He used royalty, his celebrity, to his advantage.’</p>
      <p>The woman said Ghislaine Maxwell, 57, was also at the parties, ‘keeping an eye over what was happening and mingling with the guests’.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxwell has continuously denied allegations of wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime.</p>
      <p>The former stripper added that Epstein would record his guests on cameras so that he could ‘have leverage’ over them in the future.</p>

      <p>Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell in August earlier this year while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Two jail workers who were on duty at the time have since been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jeffrey-epsteins-two-prison-guards-arrested-failing-check-11182452/">arrested for allegedly failing to check on him every half an hour</a> as their job required.</p>
      <p>They have been taken into custody in New York and are expected to appear in the US District Court in Manhattan.</p>

      <p>The Duke of York has continuously denied any wrongdoing during his friendship with Epstein, including witnessing any criminal activity.</p>
      <p>He denies having sex with Virginia Roberts, who claimed that she had slept with the prince three times, including one occasion when she was 17.</p>
      <p>During an interview with Newsnight, he stated that he had been at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/pizza-express-woking-flooded-fake-reviews-prince-andrew-interview-11169085/">Pizza Express in Woking on March 10 2001</a>, when the allegations are alleged to have taken place.</p>
      <p>He also said he was also previously unable to sweat, disputing Ms Roberts claims that he had had to take a bath because he was perspiring so much.</p>
      <p>The prince told presenter Emily Maitlis: ‘I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at.</p>
      <p>‘It was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>
      <p>Andrew has since stepped down from royal duties after he was dropped by a string of charities and organisations.</p>
