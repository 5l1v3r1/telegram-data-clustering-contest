      <p>Jose Mourinho may already be in charge of Tottenham Hotspur, but he will have to wait at least a couple of months before he can put his stamp on the team.<br/> <br/>However, if Levy does not grant the new manager funds in the January, then Mourinho could be forced to wait until next season to really make the team his.<br/> <br/>Taking this into consideration, Jose may have to look towards youth to create his own brand in North London over the short term. He seems keen on turning a new leaf and developing academy players, so who could he put his faith in?<br/> <br/>Troy Parrott <br/> <br/>What better way to make your mark in Tottenham than to be the one to bed Parrott into the first team? Spurs fans are excited about the teenager and are dying to see him in the matchday squad more often. Not only this, but he looks more than good enough.<br/> <br/>Japhet Tanganga <br/> <br/>Spurs look awful at the back. Tanganga is the best and brightest centre-back in the Tottenham academy. This seems like a very simple way for Mourinho to fix and problem and make his mark early on with a new face in the starting XI.<br/> <br/>Ryan Sessegnon <br/> <br/>A Pochettino signing, but could Mourinho make him famous in North London? The Argentine was only able to hand Sessegnon a couple of appearances in a Spurs shirt, meaning the player had barely mate a dent in the team. Hand him a few starts and watch him blossom, Mourinho could be know as the one to develop Sessegnon into a star.<br/> <br/>Oliver Skipp <br/> <br/>Definitely a Pochettino discovery, but he seems to have disappeared over the past six months. Barely given a minute this season in the Premier League, Skipp has yet to be given a real chance in the first team. We’ve seen how good Harry Winks has become, perhaps Mourinho could perform the same magic with Skipp.<br/> <br/>Jack Clarke <br/> <br/>Another Pochettino signing who has yet to be given a chance in a Spurs shirt. Clarke is still out on loan to Leeds United, but could be utlised soon if recalled in January. Could Mourinho hand him his Spurs debut before long?</p>
