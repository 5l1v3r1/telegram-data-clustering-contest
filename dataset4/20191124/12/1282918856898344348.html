      <p>In the midst of a Pawar power play, sources have informed that Ajit Pawar rebelled over the position of Deputy Chief Minister.  NCP's Baramati MLA was reportedly angry with NCP chief and his uncle, Sharad Pawar over the post of Deputy Chief Minister, hence ditched his party to back BJP's Devendra Fadnavis-led government. </p>
      <blockquote>Ajit Pawar was of the knowledge that the NCP chief was in favour Jayant Patil, over him for the post of Deputy Chief Minister. On Saturday, amid the political turbulence, Sharad Pawar <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/ncp-sacks-ajit-pawar-as-legislative-party-leader.html">removed </a>Ajit as the NCP legislative party chief and replaced him with Jayant Patil. While the BJP claims that the entire NCP legislative party has consented to be a part of the government, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar clarified that he did not endorse the decision of Ajit Pawar.</blockquote>

      <h3>Ajit Pawar refuses to budge</h3>
      <p>After taking oath as the Deputy CM of Maharashtra, Ajit Pawar said, "From result day to this day no party was able to form a Government, Maharashtra was facing many problems including farmer issues, so we decided to form a stable Government." According to sources, the rebel NCP leader and Sharad Pawar's nephew has denied to come back or even talk to the senior NCP leaders. </p>
      <p>After NCP leaders Dilip Walse Patil, Sunil Tatkare came to meet the Deputy Chief Minister at his brother, Sriniwas Pawar's residence, Ajit Pawar <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/politics/rebel-ajit-pawar-refuses-to-return-to-ncp-meet-senior-party-leaders.html">refused </a>to speak to any senior NCP leader, including Praful Patel or Supriya Sule. Ajit Pawar, who had gone underground on Saturday after swearing-in as the Deputy of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, returned to his private residence in Mumbai's Churchgate, early on Sunday. Photographs accessed by Republic Media Network show Ajit Pawar meeting with NCP leaders on the morning of Sunday, giving a clue as to his status within the party. </p>
      <blockquote>Jayant Patil visited Raj Bhawan on Sunday to submit a complete list of NCP MLAs to the Governor's secretariat. Speaking to the media, Patil admitted to having Ajit Pawar's name on the list. "I have submitted a complete list. Ajit Pawar's name also on the list. I am going to meet him at his residence to convince him," Jayant Patil told Republic. </blockquote>
