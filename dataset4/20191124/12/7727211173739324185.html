      <h2>"What. The. Actual. Hell."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:15:44+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/emilia-bona/" target="_blank">Emilia Bona</a></address>
      <p>Aldi shoppers were left devastated after spending hours in online queues for the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Kevin the Carrot range</a> - only to come away empty-handed.</p>
      <p>The festive range is so popular there were  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/watch-incredible-scenes-shoppers-fight-15449011">huge queues</a>  at Aldi’s Liverpool stores when it went on sale last year and items sold out within 24 hours.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/can-buy-kevin-carrot-2019-17305408">Aldi's Kevin the Carrot range</a> is back in stores from Thursday, November 28 at 8am - but shoppers had the chance to avoid the chaos and order online today.</p>
      <p>But the demand for the plush toys, pyjamas and tree decorations was so high that shoppers were left in online queues thousands of customers long.</p>

      <p>Anyone trying to access <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aldi">the Aldi website</a> this morning was met with a message saying: "You're in the queue... We're very sorry, but there are currently lots of people trying to access the Aldi website.</p>
      <p>"We've automatically placed you in a queue. Don't worry about refreshing - this page will update automatically as soon as you can enter the site."</p>
      <p>Queue positions went from around 2,000 at 8am to an unbelievable 10,000 at 10am, as thousands of shoppers tried to get on the site.</p>
      <p>Plenty of frustrated shoppers took to social media to share their disappointment at missing out on the range.</p>

      <p>One Twitter user with the handle 'YNWA' tweeted: "Queued for five hours last night for #KevinTheCarrot merchandise on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Aldi</a> website. Fortunately I got everything I wanted, but I feel so sorry for people queuing at the moment because most things have sold out and they have no idea."</p>
      <p>Rachel Jones tweeted: "Just went looking for something on the aldi website and did not realise it was Kevin the Carrot release day and I'm in a queue of 20,000 people to access the site. what. the. actual. hell."</p>
      <p>Sam Garstang Heath said: "Don’t bother all sold out was on the web at midnight till 1.15am nothing on it, kept saying we are updating won’t be long, so we gave up. Went on this morning and they're sold out."</p>

      <p>Karen Swan said: "Its 6.30am on Sunday and theres no Kevins left......?! Sort it out @AldiUK #kevinthecarrot #ineedone"</p>
      <p>Sam tweeted: "Anyone actually managed to access the @AldiUK website to see if Kevin The Carrot is there. My daughter missed out last year and it looks like she will again."</p>
