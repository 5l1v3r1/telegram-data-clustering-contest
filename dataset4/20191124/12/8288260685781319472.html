      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Villa are being linked with a loan move for the Reds youngster - and Liverpool supporters think a temporary move could work for their England age-group striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:38:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool starlet Rhian Brewster is being linked with a January loan move to Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old striker is reportedly on <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa's</a> radar ahead of the transfer window reopening in the new year, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/just-play-hepburn-murphy-aston-17307488">according to the Mirror</a> - and Crystal Palace, Swansea City and Leeds United are also credited with an interest.</p>
      <p>Brewster - a Golden Boot winner during England's Under-17 World Cup triumph in 2017 - made his senior Liverpool debut earlier this season in a Carabao Cup win over MK Dons.</p>
      <p>He is yet to make a Premier League appearance for Jurgen Klopp's side, but he is expected to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-liverpool-carabao-cup-17207617">feature against Villa in the quarter-finals</a> of the Carabao Cup next month.</p>

      <p>In light of Villa and three other sides being linked with a loan move, Liverpool fans have been having their say on a potential move for the teenage forward.</p>
      <p><b>Rachel Ellis:</b> I think Rhian probably needs more game time with u23s but Klopp obviously wants him in and around the first team. It's a difficult time for Rhian. He needs to show a mental toughness to get through it, take his opportunity when it comes and hopefully he will be alright.</p>
      <p><b>Rizwan Ahmed:</b> People overhyped him too much. From what I've seen, he looks like a goal poacher but disappears during large parts of the game. Needs a loan move. You can tell he's been learning from firmino because he tends to drop into midfield and try threading passes to the wingers.</p>
      <p><b>@strickyfootball:</b> He’s 19 and was being talked up as the answer to our striker depth issue, people were naive to think this, he needs a loan move</p>
      <p><b>@stefanchamp:</b> People need realise as well he only 19 in football Thats there are so few who break into the team at the age</p>
      <p><b>@BobbySocialist:</b> only played two games hasn't he?</p>
