      <h1>Cardi B Writes Lewd Comment For Offset After He Shared This Video — Some Fans Say She Went Too Far And Must Learn To Keep Few Things Private</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:36:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Even though Cardi B did not produce a new album this year, she still has a chance to take a Grammy home with her when the next awards take place in 2020, as the music star is nominated alongside her husband, Offset, in the category Best Rap Performance.</p>
      <p>It appears that after the Grammy nominations were out recently, Offset decided to get himself a present for the work well done, as the rapper shared a video of himself standing in front of a brand new red Ferrari.</p>
      <p>In the clip, the excited nominee added the caption, “After the Grammy Nominations, I nominated myself with a Rari.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Offset’s wife expressed the desire to give her husband a gift of her own, as she wrote a comment saying that she missed him and concluded with her real wish, “I want some Grammy-nominated d*ck.”</p>
      <p>Fans had a lot of comments about Cardi’s remark — some found it cute while others said she went too far.</p>

      <p>Cardi B and Offset started their relationship back in 2017 and married by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The couple announced that they were expecting a child on April 7th 2018, and Cardi B gave birth to their baby daughter, Kulture, on July 10, 2018.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, not everything was going smooth with their relationship, as a few months after the birth of Kulture, Cardi B announced on social media that she wanted a divorce, because Offset was reportedly cheating on her with other women.</p>
      <p>At the time, everyone was convinced that the romance between the two was over, and Cardi B confirmed their separation was final on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>However, the couple reconciled and are working on their marriage.</p>
