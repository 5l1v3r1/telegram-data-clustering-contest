      <h3>iPhone</h3>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving and continuing through Black Friday, Best Buy will host a few carrier deals for the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro. If you’re looking for a discount on an iPhone 11 Pro, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fiphone%2Fshop-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max%2Fpcmcat1568147641595.c">you may be able to buy one for as little as $499 (roughly half off)</a>, but only if you activate a new line with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Sprint, and also trade in your old phone. How much you pay overall will depend on how much trade-in value your phone has.</p>
      <p>A similar deal applies to the less expensive iPhone 11 at Best Buy, which normally has a $699 starting price. After activating it and trading in your old phone, the final cost after your installment plan is paid off <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fiphone-11%3Firclickid%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26acampID%3D614286">will be $199</a>.</p>
      <p>Over at Target, the iPhone deals kick off on Black Friday and last through Sunday. You can get a $200 gift card when you activate either the <a href="https://fave.co/2Qn7m2e">iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> with Verizon or AT&amp;T. Target will also offer a $200 gift card for the <a href="https://fave.co/2O8o2YF">iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max</a>, which cost less per month than the iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max.</p>

      <h3>Google Pixel</h3>
      <p>Available now through December 1st, Target will offer a $300 gift card <a href="https://fave.co/33GeIBX">when you activate a Google Pixel 4 or Google Pixel 4 XL</a> with an installment plan on Verizon or AT&amp;T.</p>
      <p>If you’re on the hunt for an unlocked Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL, you can get $200 off of all configurations from various retailers from now through December 2nd.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixel 4 is $599 at <a href="https://amzn.to/36NspRF">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fgoogle-pixel-4-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1570497903420.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1570497903420">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2X3qmo4">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
        <li>Pixel 4 XL is $699 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2CCAVoN">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fshop-by-carrier-google-pixel-4-xl%2Fpcmcat1570498366095.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1570498366095">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2pSGYT6">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If getting a gift card doesn’t matter much to you, Best Buy will take $400 off of the Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fpcmcat1566430029496.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1566430029496%26irclickid%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4V0E3AcTY0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4V0E3AcTY0%26acampID%3D614286">if you activate either phone with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Sprint</a>. No trade-in is necessary, so this is a great deal that should see your monthly payment (not counting from your data plan charges) at around $20 per month for the cheapest Pixel 4 configuration. This deal begins on Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Google Fi’s Pixel 4 deal is appealing if you don’t mind the savings coming in the form of service credit. <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-4">The Pixel 4 with 64GB costs $799</a>, so no drop in price there, but Google will give you 50 percent of what you spend (up to $500) back in Fi service credit when you use the phone for 60 consecutive days.</p>
      <p>As of right now, the 2018 Pixel 3 is discounted at Amazon, and in fact, it’s cheaper than we’ve ever seen it sell for. <a href="https://amzn.to/35s4ZQ1">The 64GB version is $349</a> (usually around $449). <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-3">This phone costs $199 from Google Fi</a>, but only if you activate it within 30 days of receiving it. There’s no minimum amount of time you’ll need to stay with Fi.</p>
      <p>The unlocked Pixel 3A and Pixel 3A XL will be $100 off of their usual prices through several retailers below on Thanksgiving, November 28th, lasting through Cyber Monday, December 2nd.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixel 3A will be $299.99 at <a href="https://amzn.to/34JB8lT">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-3%2Fgoogle-pixel-3a-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1556124332800.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1556124332800">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3a">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/33w8Aw7">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
        <li>Pixel 3A XL will be $379.99 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2qFmmh9">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-3%2Fgoogle-pixel-3a-xl-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1556124838576.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1556124838576">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3a">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/32sUH0q">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Google Fi currently offers the Pixel 3A starting at $249 for new and existing subscribers, and <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-3a">it will knock an addition $150 off of the price</a> (totaling $99) if you activate it within 30 days of ordering it.</p>

      <h3>OnePlus</h3>

      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2s4frPl">The Razer Phone 2 is currently $299.99</a> at Amazon (usually $399.99). This is the lowest price we’ve seen yet, and while this phone isn’t for everyone, it’s the only phone (that’s this affordable, anyway) to have a 120Hz refresh rate display. It will work on Verizon, as well as GSM carriers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#moto-g7">The Moto G7, currently our favorite affordable phone, is only $99</a> from Google Fi. There are strings attached, minimal as they might be. To get the discount, you’ll need to activate the phone with Google Fi service within 30 days of purchasing it, but there’s no minimum amount of time you need to keep the phone on Fi service, so you can easily take it to a different carrier.</p>
