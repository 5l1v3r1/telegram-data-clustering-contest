      <h1>Crisis On Infinite Earths Teaser Destroys a Universe, Multiple Heroes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:11:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">L.D. Nolan</a></address>
      <p>The CW has revealed a new trailer for the upcoming Arrowverse crossover, "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>," and it shows a universe and multiple main heroes seemingly getting destroyed.</p>
      <p>Shared by The CW on YouTube, the trailer begins with Star Labs getting destroyed, though it's not exactly clear in which universe, though other parts of the teaser hint that it may be Earth-1. The footage also shows Iris West and various other heroes getting consumed by an anti-matter wave. Although it's not clear just yet what versions of these characters are getting destroyed or if some last minute work will save them, the footage certainly looks dire.</p>
