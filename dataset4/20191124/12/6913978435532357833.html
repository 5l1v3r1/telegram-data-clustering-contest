      <p><b>NASIRIYAH, IRAQ -</b> Two protesters were shot dead overnight in Iraq's south, where resurging anti-government sit-ins on Sunday turned up the heat on paralyzed politicians facing the country's largest grassroots movement in decades.<br/><br/>Since October 1, Iraq's capital and majority-Shiite south have been swept by mass demonstrations over corruption, lack of jobs and poor services that have escalated into calls for an overhaul of the ruling system.<br/><br/>Top leaders have publicly acknowledged the demands as legitimate and promised measures to appease protesters, including hiring drives, electoral reform and a cabinet reshuffle.<br/><br/>But the rallies have continued, waning on some days but swelling when demonstrators felt politicians were stalling.<br/><br/>On Sunday, protesters in the southern city of Nasiriyah blockaded five main bridges, shut down schools and burned tires outside public offices in anger.<br/><br/>They blocked access to oil fields and companies around the city, torching as well its Shiite endowment center, a government body that manages religious sites.<br/><br/>Overnight, two protesters had been shot dead and at least 47 others wounded by security forces in the city, some 300 kilometers south of the capital Baghdad.<br/><br/>An estimated 350 people have been killed and thousands wounded since October 1, according to a tally compiled by AFP as authorities are not providing precise or updated figures.<br/><br/>That makes the protests Iraq's deadliest grassroots movement in decades, but also its most widespread.<br/><br/>The rural and tribalistic south has carried the torch of the movement for weeks, with students and teachers leading rallies outside schools and public offices.<br/><br/>In an attempt to resume classes, the education ministry issued a directive for schools to open normally on Sunday, the first day of the work week in Iraq.<br/><br/>But protesters in Nasiriyah defied the order and shut down schools anyway, AFP's correspondent said.<br/><br/>In the oil-rich southern city of Basra, demonstrators blocked main roads just before dawn, including those leading to the ports of Umm Qasr and Khor al-Zubair.<br/><br/>The ports, which bring in food and medicine to Iraq but also export fuel products, have seen some delays in loading and offloading due to the unrest in recent weeks.<br/><br/>Clashes also pitted protesters against security forces overnight in Karbala, one of Iraq's two Shiite holy cities.<br/><br/>The two sides lobbed Molotov cocktails at each other from behind barricades set up in small alleyways.<br/><br/>"They're throwing Molotov cocktails at us and at midnight, they started shooting live rounds," one demonstrator said.<br/><br/>The streets were lit only by fires from the exploding makeshift grenades and green laser pointers used by demonstrators to disrupt the riot police's vision.<br/><br/>"Our demands are clear: the downfall of this corrupt government," said another demonstrator, his face wrapped in a black scarf. -AFP</p>
