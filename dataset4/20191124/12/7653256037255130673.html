      <p>"I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb is our leader. Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable Government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the State and its people," the 60-year-old leader tweeted.</p>
      <p>"There is absolutely no need to worry, all is well. However a little patience is required. Thank you very much for all your support," he tweeted.</p>
