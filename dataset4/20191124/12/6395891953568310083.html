      <p>Here are some of our favorite moments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ferrell, playing billionaire Tom Steyer:</b> "Health care is important, but housing affects everything – where you sleep, where you shop, where you get your shoes shined, where you buy your jewels, where you raise peacocks. Am I relatable?"</li>
        <li><b>Harrelson, playing former Vice President Joe Biden:</b> "America, I see you, and I see the faces you all make when I talk. You're scared – scared I'll say something off-color, or even worse, on color."</li>
        <li><b>David, playing Sen. Bernie Sanders:</b> "Here's my plan for health care: no co-pay, no out-of-pocket. The only thing that comes out of my pocket are tissues; receipts; loose cough drops; a movie stub for 'Florence Foster Jenkins,' which was, eh, so-so; and, of course, the little button in the baggy that comes with the pants. Most people throw it out. Do yourself a favor: Hold on to it. You never know!"</li>
        <li><b>Rudolph, playing Sen. Kamala Harris:</b> "I'm just gonna have some fun and see if I can get some viral moments. Mama needs a GIF."</li>
        <li> <b>Armisen, playing former New York Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg:</b> "I'd like to see those Trump supporters come up with a conspiracy theory about a Jewish billionaire with his own media company. Good luck making that stick."</li>
        <li><b>Dratch, playing Sen. Amy Klobuchar:</b> "I got $17,000 from ex-boyfriends. All I had to do was threaten to come back in their lives."</li>
        <li><b>Kate McKinnon, playing Sen. Elizabeth Warren: </b>"I've got mom-hosting-Thanksgiving energy; I'm a little overwhelmed because I thought 10 people were coming and now there’s 30 million."</li>
        <li><b>Colin Jost, playing South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg:</b> "America, I know I can do this because my supporters are a diverse coalition from young to old, gay to straight, white to eggshell. Thank you."</li>
        <li><b>Cecily Strong, playing Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: </b>"I have no interest in those Dalmatian puppies, muhahaha. I yield my time."</li>
        <li><b>Chris Redd, playing Sen. Cory Booker: </b>"Vice President Biden, I was stunned to hear you don't support the legalization of marijuana; in fact – rehearsed joke – I thought you were high when you said it."</li>
        <li><b>Bowen Yang, playing tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang: </b>"I wanna take this opportunity to announce my VP, the new Tesla Cybertruck!"</li>
