      <p>John Boyega has said he is keen to have a relationship, but that dating while being famous is “complicated”.</p>
      <p>The Star Wars actor said that he has had to learn whether people are being genuine or reacting to his fame, although he was previously in love and had a five-year relationship.</p>
      <p>Boyega, 27, told Sunday Times Style magazine: “Life is good. Health is good. Family is good.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t shy away from my want for a partnership and companionship.”</p>

      <p>The actor, who is currently single, said that it is not necessarily more difficult to have a relationship while being in the public eye, saying that “anyone who tells you it is, is lying!”</p>
      <p>But he added: “It’s complicated, though. There are people reacting to your celebrity a bit, you’ve got to suss that out early on.</p>
      <p>“But I never understood people who say, ‘I can’t be with you because I want to focus on my career.’ What were you focused on before? Why can’t you focus on both?</p>
      <p>“It’s about supporting each other’s endeavours.”</p>
      <p>Asked if any other celebrities have messaged him directly on social media, Boyega said: “My DMs are dry! The other day, my mates were, like, ‘Let’s go in your DMs, let’s see what it’s like (to be famous).’</p>
      <p>“My boy scrolls through, like, ‘Bruv, this person is asking you what planet Tatooine is on.’</p>

      <p>“Star Wars geeks. Those are the DMs I get.”</p>
      <p>Boyega added: “I like it, though, let’s be honest: I love the nerdy stuff.”</p>
      <p>The London-born star will next appear in the ninth instalment of the Star Wars franchise, The Rise Of Skywalker, out next month.</p>
      <p>He rose to international fame after debuting as Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, having previously appeared in the film Attack The Block and TV series Becoming Human.</p>
