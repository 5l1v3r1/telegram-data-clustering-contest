        <b>The Hong Kong district elections produced record numbers of voters amid the ongoing democracy protests.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The protests in Hong Kong, which have often been violent, have been ongoing for half a year as the city looks to gain democracy.</p>
      <p>Recent <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/record-numbers-vote-in-hong-kong-amid-angry-calls-for-democracy-1.4093393">attacks</a> on election candidates have thrown the Chinese-controlled city into the news spotlight as the authorities struggle to deal with the demands for suffrage.</p>
      <p>With eight hours left to vote at 2.30pm local time, 1,746,709 people had turned up, a rate of 42.26%, surpassing figured who voted in the last elections four years ago.</p>
      <p>Ming Lee, who works in event production, said she hopes that the higher turnout is a positive sign for the pro-democracy camp as it contests seats that were uncontested and dominated by pro-Beijing candidates in the past.</p>
      <p>She said: "I hope this vote can counter the voice of the pro-establishment, so as to bring in more voices from the democrats. The social problems encouraged people to vote and to focus on political issues."</p>

      <p>Another person, 30-year-old service industry worker Tsz, said that the figures showed people's determination for change.</p>
      <p>"The high turnout rate...definitely reflects Hong Kong people's hope for genuine universal suffrage."</p>
      <p>Civil Rights Front candidate Jimmy Sham was beaten by men with hammers in October.</p>
      <p>He said: "We can see Hongkongers are longing for a chance to express their stand, We don't know yet, at the end of the day, if the democrats can win a majority. But I hope for our Hong Kong citizens can vote for the future of Hong Kong."</p>
      <p>Current leader of the city, Beijing-supported Carrie Lam, promise that her government, which has been widely seen as out of touch with the people they represent, would listen more closely to the views of its district councils.</p>
      <p>She said: "I hope this kind of stability and calm is not only for todayâ€™s election, but to show that everyone does not want Hong Kong to fall into a chaotic situation again."</p>
