      <p>Sources said Timberlake<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10406446/justin-bieber-babies-hailey-turn-me-on/">,</a> 38, appeared to have been drinking heavily and was unsteady on his feet.</p>
      <p>"At one stage he grabbed her hand and rested it on his knee. She then gently started stroking his leg.</p>
      <p>“Then he clutched her hand with both of his and was playing with her hands.”</p>
      <p>Timberlake had been snapped wearing his wedding ring earlier in the week but was not seen with it on during the night out.</p>
