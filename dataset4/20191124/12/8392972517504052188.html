      <p>Former footballer Ian Wright is set to have <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> viewers in stitches tonight as he takes part in the Crevice Of Cruelty challenge.</p>
      <p>Viewers will see the one-time England ace scream for his mum as he takes part in the trial alongside campmate Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jac-jossas-breakdown-as-shes-picked-for-trial-again/">had a meltdown</a> when it was announced she would be taking part in the trial.</p>

      <p>The actress put her head in her hands as she cried and said: "I donâ€™t want to do this any more man."</p>
      <p>And it seems as if Jac's fears about taking part most certainly didn't go unfounded, as the task sees herself and Ian head into an underground cavern.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline will be seen surrounded by spiders as she waits for Ian to feed stars through to her from his underground cave.</p>
      <p>"Let's go, let's go, keep going, I don't want to be in here," she can be heard screaming.</p>
      <p>"Please! Please! Please," she shouts.</p>
