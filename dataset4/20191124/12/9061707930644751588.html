      <h1>Wonder strike beats Brewers as Posh take spoils in stoppage time</h1>
      <h2>Manager Nigel Clough booked as frustration with officials' decisions weighs heavy in League One defeat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:48:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Burton Albion's mini-run of three unbeaten games in League One was ended cruelly by a spectacular stoppage-time goal by Peterborough United's Joe Ward.</p>
      <p>A loose ball sat up nicely for the Posh midfielder 30 yards out and he may never catch a shot more sweetly in his career, the ball actually lifting the back frame of the goal from the ground as it rocketed into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Burton keeper Kieran O'Hara had no chance and watched the replay ruefully several times on the big screen as he left the pitch. Good luck to him if he was trying to work out how he might have saved it.</p>
      <p>Before that, the Brewers had generally looked the more likely winners but we have been saying that too often this season.</p>
      <p>Peterborough will have been relieved to keep their strong season on track with three points they barely deserved but that only brings another well-worn football cliche into play. Good teams find a way to win on poor days. Posh are a good team, and they did.</p>
      <p>One of the problems for the Brewers is the stop-start nature of their League season so far and perhaps being left in only one cup competition now will start to allay that.</p>
      <p>Only two of their last six matches have been in the League.</p>
      <p>All too often, they are a good team not winning matches at the moment and the frustration is becoming evident, not least from manager Nigel Clough, who was animated and tetchy on the sidelines for much of this one and was eventually booked.</p>
      <p>In truth, rival boss Darren Ferguson was no less annoyed with a puzzling refereeing display by Befordshire official Will Finnie but surely Clough and his players must guard against expecting the worst from a referee every time they set foot on the field.</p>
      <p>Anyway, that apart, the game began well for Burton as they nullified Posh's efforts and got forward plenty themselves.</p>
      <p>Richard Nartey returned at centre-back in place of Jake Buxton and set a marker with a good challenge to halt Ricky-Jade Jones in the fifth minute, the Brewers going forward from this to have the first chance, David Templeton putting the ball across the box from the left and Scott Fraser shooting wide.</p>

      <p>Marcus Maddison hit a speculative shot well over the bar for Posh in the 10th minute but it was their only shot of the first half.</p>
      <p>A minute later, John Brayford, who showed no ill effects from his sore knees, played a one-two with Lucas Akins and shot a foot wide from just inside the box.</p>
      <p>Fraser and Templeton both had shots blocked in another attack, before Templeton attempted another of his curlers from just outside the box, cutting in from the left, but shooting tamely wide.</p>
      <p>The best chance of the half came two minutes before the break when Fraser went on a determined run from just outside the box on the left, jinking past three defenders before pulled the ball back inches out of Akins' reach.</p>
      <p>That it had been very much the Brewers' half was evident by the urgency with which Peterborough began after the break, harsh words from Ferguson no doubt ringing in their ears.</p>
      <p>Ryan Edwards collected the game's first booking for an ill-tempered late challenge on Maddison, a player who tends to wind opponents up but Posh came closest yet after 56 minutes when the ball fell to Mo Eisa six yards out, his shot brilliantly blocked by Kieran Wallace.</p>
      <p>Maddison found space for a 25-yard volley after 63 minutes but it was straight at O'Hara and Burton looked to have weathered the storm at this point.</p>

      <p>Brayford had another chance to break into the box and shoot after 69 minutes, picked out by Edwards, but keeper Christy Pym dived to his right to turn the effort away.</p>
      <p>Peterborough wanted a penalty when Eisa fell in a crowd of players near the penalty spot but the referee waved play on.</p>
      <p>Soon, Burton had another injury to add to their list. Nathan Broadhead had replaced Templeton after an hour but went down with what looked a hamstring problem 12 minutes later and had to come off.</p>
      <p>With 10 minutes left, Oliver Sarkic needed treatment and a change of both shorts and shirt after a blow in the mouth left him bleeding and it was soon after this that Clough was booked, possibly the cumulative effect of his complaints.</p>
      <p>Sarkic eventually had to come off, too, limping as well as bleeding further from the mouth.</p>
      <p>It was beginning to look like coming away with a point would be a very good result for Burton, as O'Hara flew across his goal to turn away a volley from Mark Beevers.</p>
      <p>But then, just as six minutes stoppage time was signalled, came Ward's golden moment and that point was ripped away.</p>
      <p>It was a tough one to take and it gets no easier. A trip to Sunderland tomorrow will be a real test of this squad's character.</p>
