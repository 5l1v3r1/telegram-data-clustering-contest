      <p>While Neil Lennon’s quadruple treble chasers have dominated Scottish football over the last eight years, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> haven’t won any major trophies since 2011.</p>
      <p>The Light Blues suffered semi-final misery against Aberdeen at Hampden last year but after reaching the final this time around, Kent is desperate to end the club’s trophy drought.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://sport.bt.com/">BT Sport</a>: “I was here last season to realise how much it affected us as a team and as a club.</p>
      <p>“To lose in the semi-finals last year was a big disappointment.</p>
      <p>“To reach a final, it’s no secret how massive that is for the club and for each individual in the team as well.</p>
      <p>“Everybody is really excited for that. It will definitely be the biggest moment of my career, to play in that game.</p>
      <p>“If I was to come away with silverware, it would be huge.”</p>
