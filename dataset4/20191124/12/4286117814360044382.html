      <p>Moments after Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar justified his actions of joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his uncle and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said there was no question of forming an alliance with the saffron party.</p>
      <p>The NCP chief also said Ajit Pawar's statement was "false and misleading" to create confusion among the people of Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar reiterated that NCP has unanimously decided to ally with Shiv Sena and the Congress to form the government in Maharashtra</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar's statement has come just after Ajit Pawar, in his first statement after joining hands with the BJP and taking deputy chief minister's oath, said NCP's alliance with the saffron party would provide a stable government in Maharashtra for next five years.</p>
      <p>Reacting to Ajit Pawar's statement on Twitter, Sharad Pawar said, "There is no question of forming an alliance with @BJP4Maharashtra."</p>
      <p>NCP has unanimously decided to ally with @ShivSena &amp; @INCMaharashtra to form the government. Shri Ajit Pawar's statement is false and misleading in order to create confusion and false perception among the people.</p>

      <p>Taking to Twitter, Ajit Pawar had said, "I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb is our leader." Ajit Pawar said, "Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable Government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the State and its people."</p>
      <p>In another tweet, Ajit Pawar said, "There is absolutely no need to worry, all is well. However, a little patience is required. Thank you very much for all your support."</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, sources have told India Today TV that Ajit Pawar has refused to rethink his decision to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and become the deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>The Maharashtra deputy chief minister reportedly told the NCP leaders Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse Patil that tie-up with the BJP in the NCP's interests.</p>
