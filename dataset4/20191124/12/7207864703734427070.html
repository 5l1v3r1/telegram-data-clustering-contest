      <p><b>Key point: </b>The majority of pistol users in the Russian military rarely use their pistols.</p>
      <p>The PL-15 is hyped up by Kalashnikov Concern to be one of the best pistols in the world. Said to be light, accurate, and soft-shooting, Kalashnikov Concern<a href="https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/09/19/kalashnikov-to-begin-production-of-pl-15-in-2019/"> plans to start producing the gun in 2019</a>. However, the Russian military has not yet expressed official interest in procuring the gun. But should they? Does the PL-15 represent a large step up from existing sidearms?</p>
      <p>The short answer is, yes. The Russian military still predominantly uses the 9x18mm Makarov pistol, a single stack design from the 1950s. The PL-15 represents a quantum leap ahead of this ancient design, being a modern, striker-fired pistol. However, the Makarov is likely to soldier on for much longer in wide service.</p>
      <p>The story of the PL-15 begins in 2014, when Dmitri Lebedev, the pistol’s namesake and primary designer,<a href="https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/07/30/an-inside-look-at-the-history-of-russian-lebedev-pl-14-15-pistol/"> was recruited by Kalashnikov Concern</a> to work on a new pistol. Lebedev had worked in small arms for many years prior, being an armorer and competitor for various Russian competition shooting teams.</p>
      <p>He began work in a new pistol, called the PL-14 that would amalgamate the features of most successful foreign pistols into a domestic design. The pistol featured a low bore axis and long beavertail similar to Glock, Steyr M, and Caracal pistols, an internal double-action trigger similar to the original FN Five-seven, and low profile recessed controls suitable for duty use.</p>
      <p>It was tested and evaluated, but many (including firearms expert Vladimir Onokoy) found the double-action trigger to have too long of a reset for proper rapid fire. Otherwise, the ergonomics and handling of the pistol were found to be excellent.</p>
      <p>Lebedev took the pistol back to the drawing board and redesigned it as the PL-15, a revised version that incorporates a striker trigger for a fast, short reset. Interestingly, unlike the Glock and most of its imitators, the PL-15’s trigger does not feature a trigger safety, instead opting for a manual safety on the side of the gun. This is a rather uncommon configuration, although the US military’s M17 uses it as well. The PL-15 also uses an aluminum alloy frame in contrast to the Glock and most other modern service polymer pistols.</p>
      <p>By most accounts, the new PL-15 and PL-15K is an excellent pistol. So why is it unlikely that it will replace the Makarov?</p>
      <p>As with most new equipment, the PL-15 is likely to go first to very special units in the army. These units largely use Glock pistols imported and assembled at Izhmash. Replacing the Glocks with a Russian pistol likely will be used for great propaganda value.</p>
      <p>Those not fortunate enough to get Glocks largely use the MP-443 or PYa pistol. A troubled design that was arguably outdated the moment it was introduced into service, the PYa was Russia’s first serious attempt at a modern 9x19mm pistol. However, the design was brought down by low reliability, low service life, and the simple fact of being a heavy, full steel single-action/double-action pistol in an age of polymer striker service pistols.</p>
      <p>Though most of these kinks have been worked out and the PYa is a common sight in the holsters of special troops nowadays, PL-15s are likely to replace the PYa’s next, as most PYa users actually use their pistols in training and the line of duty and would benefit from a newer, better pistol. The PL-15 learned many lessons from the PYa’s troubled development: it was extensively tested, built to last (<a href="https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/russia-semi-automatic-pistols/lebedev-pl-15-eng/">no less than 10,000 rounds of very hot ammo</a>), and was designed with an aluminum frame to reduce weight.</p>
      <p>But the majority of pistol users in the Russian military rarely use their pistols. Replacing Makarovs across the entire army would be a costly endeavor for a minimal increase in combat effectiveness. If the PL-15 is wildly successful it might be bought in small numbers to replace worn out Makarovs, but it seems that the Russian military is taking a skeptical approach towards new pistols after the PYa debacle. The Makarov will soldier on.</p>
