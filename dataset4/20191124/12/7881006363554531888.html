      <p>Various rating agencies have forecasted further deterioration in economic growth due to issues like weak consumption and global headwinds. The Indian economy had expanded by 5 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal.</p>
      <p>Markets would also be influenced by factors such as rupee-dollar trend, oil prices and investment pattern by overseas investors</p>
      <p>Indices may also see a bout of volatility when the November series futures and options (F&amp;O) contracts expire on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
      <p>"Next week, focus will be on second quarter GDP numbers," said Gaurang Somaiyaa, Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd.</p>
