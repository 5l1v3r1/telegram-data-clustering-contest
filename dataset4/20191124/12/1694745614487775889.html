      <h1>Here's Everything We Know About Selena Gomez's First Album in 4 Years, SG2</h1>

      <p>It's been four years since the release of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Selena-Gomez">Selena Gomez</a>'s intimate second studio album <b>Revival</b>, and although the singer has treated fans to various musical drops throughout the years, it's finally time for her next big project: album number three. Currently known as <b>SG2</b>, the as-of-yet untitled album was announced along with a promotional trailer and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/When-Selena-Gomez-Releasing-Her-New-Album-44741115">will be released on Jan. 10</a>, just in time to celebrate the new year.</p>
      <p>Gomez is keeping a lid on the official title and tracklist, but it will include recent releases "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-46781315">Lose You to Love Me</a>" and "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-look-at-her-now-music-video-46802167">Look at Her Now</a>," which are a good indication that this era of music will be promising for the artist. In fact, "Lose You to Love Me" has since become the singer's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-billboard-hot-100-46848760">first-ever single</a> to make its way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart! According to a press release, previously dropped singles like "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Selena-Gomez-Bad-Liar-Music-Video-43551097">Bad Liar</a>," "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Selena-Gomez-Back-You-Music-Video-44833771">Back to You</a>," "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Selena-Gomez-Wolves-Music-Video-44182860">Wolves</a>" (with Marshmello), and "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Selena-Gomez-Fetish-Music-Video-43736487">Fetish</a>" (featuring Gucci Mane) will appear on the Target deluxe edition of <b>SG2</b>, so there'll be even more goodies to enjoy when the album drops in January.</p>

      <p>In an Instagram post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5I0YUWjWj8/">announcing the album release date</a>, Gomez called <b>SG2</b> "my diary from the past few years," which is pretty similar to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Selena-Gomez-Talking-About-2019-Album-Jimmy-Fallon-Video-46259820">what she told Jimmy Fallon back in June</a>. "I'm just relieved, 'cause it took me four years now to even feel at a good place with this album because I had such huge moments that happened in my life personally," she explained of her hiatus from the music industry and finishing her album. "How was I gonna capture that? How was I gonna actually feel good about what I was saying? I kept going, and I'm relieved now."</p>
      <p>We can't wait to hear what the finished product sounds like!</p>
