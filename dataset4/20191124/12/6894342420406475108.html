      <h1>iPhone 11 Smart Battery Case To Be Available For RM 539; Features Dedicated Camera Button</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:21:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/chapree/" target="_blank">Chief Chapree</a></address>
      <p>While the battery life is one of the most talked improvements within <b><a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/193733/apple-iphone-11-price-malaysia-release-date/">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/193739/apple-iphone-11-pro-malaysia-price-release/">iPhone 11 Pro</a></b>, and <b>iPhone 11 Pro Max</b>, it doesn’t stop <b>Apple</b> from coming out with Smart Battery Cases for these three devices. While the case might look identical to the cases that the company has <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/176642/iphone-xs-max-xr-official-smart-battery-case-malaysia/">made for iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max</a>, there is one major difference though.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the Smart Battery Cases for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max is equipped with a dedicated camera button. Able to support both rear and front camera, the button can also be used to record QuickTake video.</p>

      <p>Just like the Smart Battery Cases for previous generation iPhones, the new models also come with wireless charging capability. While their actual battery capacities were not revealed by Apple, the company did point out that the Smart Battery Cases are able to extend iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max’s battery life up to 50%.</p>
