      <h2>The Arsenal boss is overseeing Arsenal's worst run of form for over 20 years, with the Gunners booed off the pitch after Saturday's 20-2 draw with Southampton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:30:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal stars Freddie Ljungberg and Steve Bould are seen as the most likely replacements for Unai Emery should the Gunners decide to sack their manager.</p>
      <p>Emery is edging closer to the exit door at the Emirates Stadium after he oversaw a sixth successive match without a win at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners needed a last-gasp equaliser from Alexandre Lacazette to salvage a 2-2 draw from the relegation-threatened Saints, but that couldn't prevent Emery's side from being booed off by plenty of home fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are in their worst run of form in over 20 years, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-edging-closer-arsenal-20949405">as revealed by Mirror Sport's John Cross</a> that has led to the club's board losing patience with the former Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain boss.</p>

      <p>Head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham are not inclined to sack Emery imminently, with Sanllehi in particular well aware that his reputation is somewhat on the line and tied into that of "his man" Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners' next four games are likely to have a large bearing on the Spaniard's future.</p>

      <p>They face Eintracht Frankfurt at home in the Europa League on Thursday, before three winnable-looking Premier League games against Norwich, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Slip-ups there are likely to spell the end for Emery, with Ljungberg and Bould ready to step in on deals that are likely to last until the end of the season should they be appointed.</p>

      <p>Swede Ljungberg was promoted from the club's youth setup to work with the first-team in the summer, with the experienced Bould going the other way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> coach Mikel Arteta only narrowly missed out on the job to Emery when he was appointed in the summer of 2018, and he could still be their long-term option following more experience of working under Pep Guardiola.</p>
