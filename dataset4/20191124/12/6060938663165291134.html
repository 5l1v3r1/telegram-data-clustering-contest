      <p>KOLKATA: Former India captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sunil-Gavaskar">Sunil Gavaskar</a> on Sunday praised skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> for his efforts to uplift the standards of his side.</p>
      <p>Speaking after India thrashed Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs in their maiden day-night Test to complete a 2-0 series whitewash, Gavaskar said: "This team is always looking to create opportunities. The fitness level he (Kohli) has brought in the team is making the players put in more efforts while fielding.</p>
      <p>"For example, you saw <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravindra-jadeja">Ravindra Jadeja</a> at third man putting in extra effort to turn an impossible chance into the possibility of a catch, showing the team's eagerness."</p>
      <p>Gavaskar also spoke about Kohli mastering the extra cover drive, saying: "He has made the extra cover drive a Virat Kohli special, as we saw <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sachin-Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> master the straight drive. He plays those shots using the wrist and the bottom hand, and nobody in Indian cricket can play the extra cover drive better than Kohli."</p>
      <p>Former India opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gautam-Gambhir">Gautam Gambhir</a> talked about Kohli's performances and achievements on the show, saying: "His 70 centuries show the impact he has on world cricket. Kohli has not only made his team proud, but has also made the country proud.</p>
      <p>"He was in total control of his batting from the first ball, and the way he played shots on both sides of the wicket was an inspiration for any youngster."</p>
      <p>Sunday's victory was India 12th consecutive home series win as they also became the first team ever to complete four successive innings victories in the five-day format. India had won the first Test in Indore by an innings and 130 runs.</p>
