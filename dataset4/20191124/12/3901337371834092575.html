      <p>Kaizer Chiefs’ head coach, Ernst Middendorp, has given his thoughts on today’s vital Nedbank Cup clash against Maritzburg United saying ‘we all understand what’s at stake’.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys could take on step closer to ending the longest trophy drought in the club’s history this afternoon as they aim for a place in the final alongside Mamelodi Sundowns, but the German knows that it won’t be an easy game against his former employers.</p>
      <p>Having worked with several members of this Team of Choice squad during his time in Pietermaritzburg, Middendorp knows a bit about what to expect, but insists that ‘most importantly we want to be in the finals’ – so it’s more about the result than the performance.</p>
      <p>The Amakhosi haven’t reached the TKO final since 2015 when they were beaten 3-1 by Sundowns and haven’t won the tournament since 2010’s 3-0 demolition of Orlando Pirates, but there is a growing feeling that this could be their year.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website before the game, Middendorp said, “We expect a tight game from Maritzburg United… It will be a typical cup match. Both teams want to get to the final. That’s just how it is.</p>
      <p>“We have prepared eleven players that are capable of doing the job for us. We have several players missing and similarly we have capable players waiting for their opportunity. It is just a matter of putting combinations together – the formula is consistent throughout. The players are ready, and we all understand what’s at stake.</p>

      <p>“Maritzburg play with high intensity. We have to be ready for a tight game. I am happy with the preparations… All in all, we are looking forward to a tough match. Let’s see how it goes during the match. We know it is going to be an interesting game of football, but most importantly we want to be in the finals.”</p>
      <p>The game is due to get underway at 15h00 at Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.</p>
