      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here is going to really put stars <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> through the wringer when they take on the next bush tucker trial.</p>
      <p>Crevice of Cruelty sounds as terrifying as it looks in this teaser clip from tonight’s show.</p>
      <p>Ian and Jacqueline are separated and put into a tiny space, with poor Ian up to his neck in water.</p>
      <p>The full rules will no doubt be explained on the show, but in the video it seems like Jacqueline’s escape is dependent on how many stars Ian can fish out.</p>
      <p>As ever on I’m A Celeb, he’s got company as a few water dragons are thrown in with him.</p>
      <p>When one of the creatures gets a bit too close, Ian reacts by screaming for his mum while hosts Ant and Dec get the giggles.</p>
      <p>He needs to focus though as Jac is just as terrified in a crevice of her own, as she tells him: ‘I really don’t want to be in here.’</p>

      <p>The former EastEnders star broke down in tears when she found out she would be taking on the next challenge, and had to be comforted by the other celebs.</p>
      <p>Her husband Dan Osborne, watching from home, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/dan-osborne-begs-im-celebrity-fans-give-jacqueline-jossa-break-bushtucker-trials-star-breaks-jungle-11208473/">took to Instagram to ask fans to go easy on the actress.</a></p>

      <p>The former reality TV star, who married Jac in 2017, said: ‘‘I know I said to you all vote for Jac because she ain’t here to change light bulbs. I didn’t mean every single trial. Give her a break now. Come on.</p>
      <p>‘She keeps smashing them all. She’s worried about it but she’ll smash it. She’ll keep proving everyone . And she’s doing it with Ian Wright as well which is good. He’ll look after her.</p>
      <p>‘Let her do this one then just give her a break please. She’s getting upset now. It ain’t nice. But she’ll be good. She’ll smash it. She’ll get the stars, go back and have a nice dinner.’</p>
