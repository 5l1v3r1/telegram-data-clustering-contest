      <h1>Bookmakers pay out on Liverpool winning the Premier League in message to Man City and Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool currently lead the Premier League table ahead of Leicester City, Man City and Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:31:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool lead the Premier League by eight points and one betting company has already ruled out the chances of Leicester City, Manchester City and Chelsea closing the gap.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men led City by seven points last season but it was Pep Guardiola's side who prevailed and retained their trophy, though they trail Liverpool by nine points this season, while Chelsea are now 12 points back.</p>
      <p>However, this time the confidence around Liverpool winning the league is so high that <a href="https://twitter.com/betway/status/1198568789933211648?s=21">Betway</a> have made the decision to pay out on bets backing them to secure the title.</p>
      <p>It's clearly a publicity stunt to an extent, with the betting company announcing the call exclusively on talkSPORT this morning.</p>
      <p>A press release on Betway's website read: "Jurgen Klopp's side are eight points clear at the top of the table and we expect them to go on to win their first league title since 1990.</p>
      <p>"Betway are paying out early on Liverpool to be crowned the 2019/20 Premier League champions following their win over Crystal Palace yesterday.</p>
      <p>"Jurgen Klopp’s side are unbeaten at home since April 2017 and have claimed a remarkable 37 points from 13 games this season, only dropping points in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford against Manchester United in October."</p>
      <p>Betway's Alan Alger added: “Liverpool started the season as 9/4 second-favourites to win this year’s title, but have looked unstoppable since the opening game.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to see them dropping points many times this season, with yesterday’s win extending their incredible form.</p>
