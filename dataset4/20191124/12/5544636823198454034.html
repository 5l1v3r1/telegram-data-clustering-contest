      <p>Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi has assured Nigerians that the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line will be completed latest by April 2020.</p>
      <p>Amaechi gave this assurance on Saturday while speaking to journalists at the end of the project inspection tour on-board the train from Iju in Lagos State to Ibadan in Oyo State.</p>
      <p>The minister, who noted that the Lagos axis of the project had been challenging due to urbanisation, said that the contractor had made a significant improvement in the construction of stations.</p>
      <p>He said, “There is huge improvement compared to the last time we came. We will all agree that there is huge improvement. The contractor has assured us that by December 20 when we gather for the next inspection, the tracks will get here (Omi Adio Station) in Ibadan, Oyo State.</p>
      <p>“By then, the focus will no longer be on the tracks, but on the completion of the stations, then communications and signaling. Once we complete that, we are out of Lagos-Ibadan.</p>
      <p>“We have told you we will be out of this place (Lagos-Ibadan Standard guage rail line) latest by April (2020). We are no longer giving ourselves the time; the contractor gave us the time.</p>
      <p>“The only easy way to clear the Apapa gridlock is to get the tracks into the seaport. By this, cargoes will just be loaded into wagons and taken up to Ibadan.”</p>
