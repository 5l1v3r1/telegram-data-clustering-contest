      <p>It turns out that Russian Reversal memes, also known as "in Soviet Russia", are a real thing, according to a very reliable source.</p>
      <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911121077288099-russian-fm-lavrov-hints-on-us-2020-presidential-election-we-will-resolve-problem/">Lavrov mentioned an old joke</a> during a ceremony dedicated to the 100th birthday of renowned Soviet diplomat Oleg Troyanovsky.</p>

      <p>According to him, Troyanovsky, who was the Soviet permanent representative to the United Nations from 1977 to 1986, was attacked by activists of a Chinese NGO in New York, who threw red paint at the Soviet diplomat.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the incident, Troyanovsky readily summed it by saying "better red than dead", reversing the famous anti-Communist slogan, which was popular during the Cold War, and making his joke one of the UN's "memes" for years.</p>
