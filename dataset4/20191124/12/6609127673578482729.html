      <p>She says she is “100 per cent” sure the dirty water infection was what caused her daughter’s tragic death.</p>
      <p>And now the Daily Record claim seriously ill youngsters at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital have been falling victim to dirty water bugs since 2016.</p>
      <p>They report that the insider has approached Glasgow MSP Anas Sarwar and told how a 2017 inquiry found another 26 cases.</p>
      <p>Stenotrophomonas infection was considered as the cause of death for one of the children.</p>
      <p>Now it is claimed that 10 more cases of the same kind have been found in 2016.</p>
      <p>Sarwar said: “These latest revelations from an NHS whistleblower show that the problems at this hospital have been going on for years.</p>
      <p>"That begs the question why it has taken so long for action to be taken.</p>
      <p>“If cases were identified as early as 2016, why wasn’t that addressed then so infections in 2017 may have been avoided?</p>
      <p>“The priority now must be telling the truth to all 36 families affected in 2016 and 2017. That’s the very least they deserve following this scandal.”</p>
      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have been contacted for comment by The Scottish Sun.</p>
