      <p>A second man has been charged in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people found in the back of a truck in England last month, British police <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2019/october/murder-investigation-launched-after-39-people-found-dead-in-lorry-container/">said on Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 23-year-old man from Northern Ireland, was arrested on Friday and was charged with human trafficking offenses. He is due to appear in court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were found in the back of a truck in Essex, southern England, on October 23.</p>
      <p>Police charged Kennedy with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of people with a view to exploitation and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of U.K. immigration law.</p>
      <p>Kennedy is the second man charged in the case, after the truck driver was charged with 39 counts of manslaughter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/truck-driver-charged-with-39-counts-of-manslaughter/">last month</a>.</p>
