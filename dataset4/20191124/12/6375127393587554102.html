      <h1>Complaints, problem</h1>

      <h3>Complaints and problems raised by several competing nations greeted Philippine organizers over the weekend as hostilities in a number of sports kick off today ahead of the formal opening of the 30th Southeast Asian Games.</h3>
      <p>In a press conference, football teams from Timor Leste, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand shared their sad experiences as they blew into town, complaining of problems in transportation, hotel accommodations, food and scheduling of practice sessions.</p>
      <p>The Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (Phisgoc) was quick to apologise for the inconvenience and confusion experienced by the athletes and officials and vowed to do better.</p>
      <p>“We acknowledge our shortcomings and vow to do better,” Phisgoc said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Shaking his head in disappointment, Cambodian football coach Felix Dalmas rued  how their shuttle from the airport to their hotel was delayed without being informed of what went wrong.</p>
      <p>“We waited 8 to 9 hours to get to our hotel,” said Dalmas, adding the situation “wasn’t ideal, but the members of our team quickly adjusted”.</p>
      <p>Fox Sports Asia also reported that Timor-Leste also experienced the same thing— left stranded for hours and the airport . Too sad, the team was taken to the wrong hotel by the bus driver assigned to fetch them.</p>
      <p>There were issues with food, too.</p>
      <p>Thailand football team manager Akira Nishimo, for one, said the same food was being served over and over again to members of the Thai squad, one of the hottest favourites for the football title.</p>
      <p>“I would want the players to have a good environment and good perfect meal.I’m wishing the organisers can provide that for our team players,” Nishimo said.</p>
      <p>According to Nishimo, the Thai squad also got a taste of the Philippine notorious traffic on Saturday, something that forced them to cancel its practice session since going to the venue from the hotel was near impossible because of the heavy gridlock.</p>
      <p>Another football mentor in Fabiano Flora of Timor Leste also could not hide his frustration, saying he hopes that the same thing will not happen again.</p>
      <p>“I think all nations deserve respect. But now, it’s finished, we just focus on the games,” Flora said.</p>
      <p>Action in football starts in earnest today in two venues, a few days before the 10-nation, 12-day meet formally takes off in a riot of colors on Saturday, Npv. 30, at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
      <p>Enjoying the hometown edge, the National Under-22 team takes on Cambodia in Group A at 8 p.m. at the Rizal stadium while the Malditas, as the women’s footballers are known for, play Myanmar also at 8 p.m. at the Binan stadium in Biñan, Laguna.</p>
      <p>The first game is always very important and if they follow our instructions and give their best, our boys can win,” said Serbian coach Goran Milosevic, who took over the reins of the Under-22 squad last August.</p>
      <p>“We will take it one match at a time,” Milosevic added.    </p>
      <p>Hostilities in netball and floorball, two events Filipino sports  fans don’t even know, also get underway today in two separate venues.</p>
      <p>The Philippines faces Indonesia in the men’s and women’s floor ball at the UP College of Human Kinetics in Quezon City at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m., respectively, while the  hosts meet the Singaporeans in netball at 3 p.m. at the Sta. Rosa Multi-Sports Complex in Sta. Rosa, Laguna.</p>
