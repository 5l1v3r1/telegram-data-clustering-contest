      <h3>ALLEN Durham completed a double-double as Meralco eliminated Alaska, 94-84, to barge into the PBA Governors' Cup semifinals at the Smart Araneta Coliseum last night.</h3>
      <p>Durham had 28 points and 16 rebounds to go with eight assists as the second-ranked Bolts needed just one game to end the Aces' first conference under new coach Jeffrey Cariaso.</p>
      <p>Allein Maliksi, who was the top local scorer with 23 points, prouduced key baskets in Meralco's fourth quarter run that kept Alaska at bay.</p>
      <p>“They really gave us a scare,” said Bolts coach Norman Black.</p>
      <p>Maliksi iced the game with back-to-back baskets to push the Bolts’ lead, 92-81, with 1:02 left in the ballgame that broke the backs of the Aces</p>
      <p>JV Casio put Alaska within five, 77-82, off banked shot floater  at the 5:25 mark.</p>
      <p>Casio took the scoring mantle for the Aces with 20 points while Simon Enciso chipped in 16 points.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, top-ranked NLEX hopes to get the job done against No. 8 NorthPort as the quarterfinals resume today at the Big Dome.</p>
      <p>"We have to finish the job tomorrow. Or else they will finish it for us," stated Guiao on the eve of the 4:30 p.m. match.</p>
      <p>Ranked Batang Pier to realize only their second semifinals appearance since last season's Philippine Cup.</p>
      <p>Magnolia's crown is at stake as it tangles with TNT at 7 p.m. with the Hotshots in a do-or-die situation as the No. 6 team sversus the third-ranked KaTropa.</p>
      <p>It's either Magnolia forges a rubber match or the Hotshots see the end of their reign as champs.</p>
      <p>TNT holds the crucial twice-to-beat advantage but it is still bracing for a big, big fight versus Magnolia, which dealt them a 93-100 defeat in their road showdown in Davao City only last Nov. 16.</p>
      <p>A boost for the KaTropa is the return of main local player Jayson Castro from sickbay.</p>
      <p>Castro was still out when they suffered their seven-point loss to the Hotshots. When the many-time national team member returned to action, TNT snapped a three-game losing skein, repulsing San Miguel, 114-109, to salvage a spot in the top four.</p>
      <p>The scores:</p>
      <p>Meralco (94) - Durham 28, Maliksi 23, Newsome 17, Almazan 8, Amer 6, Faundo 4, Caram 4, Quinto 2, Hodge 2, Pinto 0.</p>
      <p>Alaska (84) - Casio 20, Enciso 16, House 11, Manuel 9, Tratter 7, Herndon 5, Ayaay 5, Thoss 4, Ahanmisi 4, Racal 3, Galliguez 0, Brondial 0.</p>
