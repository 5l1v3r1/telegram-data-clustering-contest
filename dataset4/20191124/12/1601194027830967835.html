      <p>Once again, the last seven days in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> have been just as newsworthy off-screen than the in-ring product has been on-screen.</p>
      <p>Much of this week’s WWE programming has revolved around the multiple invasions between RAW, SmackDown and NXT ahead of the battle of brand supremacy at Survivor Series, while CM Punk’s first appearance as an analyst on WWE Backstage also got a lot of people talking.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, meanwhile, we learned a fascinating story about a Superstar who was rehired by the company just one day after he was fired, and Randy Orton opened up on his mindset before he signed his latest WWE contract.</p>
      <p>In this article, let’s take a look at five of the most interesting WWE backstage stories from the last week.</p>

      <p>One of the strangest stories of 2019 so far came on this week’s episode of Chris Jericho’s <a href="http://www.westwoodonepodcasts.com/pods/talk-is-jericho">Talk Is Jericho</a> podcast, which included an interview with former WWE Superstars nZo (fka <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/enzo-amore">Enzo Amore</a>) and CazXL (fka Big Cass).</p>
      <p>The three men were discussing how Amore earned a reputation for himself as a “heat magnet” during his early days with the company, especially after he suggested that his WWE ring name should be Canyon Ceman – the name of WWE’s Senior Director of Talent Development.</p>
      <p>Amore went on to reveal that he was once fired from NXT after <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-fired-superstar-for-breaking-wind-during-baron-corbin-promo">he broke wind during a Baron Corbin promo</a> in promo class. He then turned up for work the next day like nothing had happened and he was allowed to remain with the company.</p>
      <blockquote>“One time we had a promo class [with] Dusty Rhodes, Baron Corbin was up there cutting a terrible promo. Baron was trying to get help and Dusty was helping him, and I just raised my hand and everybody looked at me, and I just farted, loud as hell. They fined me two hundred and fifty dollars, fired me that night, and then I got back into work the next day and they rehired me.”</blockquote>
