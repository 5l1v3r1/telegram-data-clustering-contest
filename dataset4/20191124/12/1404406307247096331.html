      <p>In this clip, DeHaven addressed the line on Jay-Z's American Gangster track "No Hook," where he raps, "So f*ck DeHaven for caving, that's why we don't speak/Made men ain't supposed to make statements.End of the story."Â </p>
      <p>DeHaven explained that he believes the line is a response to a YouTube video DeHaven released where he lashed out at Jay-Z. DeHaven added that he understands why Jay put the line in his song, but he questions if the Brooklyn rapper knew how much it would hurt DeHaven.
