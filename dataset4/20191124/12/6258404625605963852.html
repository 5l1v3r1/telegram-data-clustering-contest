      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk definitely turned heads when he <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-500-mile-ev">unveiled the long-awaited Cybertruck</a> on Thursday evening. And it wasn't the fact that people were turning their heads to do a longing double take in amazement -- many were turning their heads to look for a puke bag. The controversial, angular styling of the Cybertruck looking nothing like mid-size or full-size trucks currently on the market, and many were just left mouth agape wondering if this was some sort of setup for the "real" truck that would be unveiled at a later date.</p>
      <p>Despite the talk of the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/elon-musk-blade-runner-cybertruck-tesla-electric-pickup-nov-21">Cybertruck's styling</a> -- and the on-stage "fail" with the supposedly armored glass -- Musk is crowing about strong preorders for the monstrous vehicle. Musk took to Twitter to proclaim that so far, Tesla has accepted 146,000 preorders for the truck.</p>

      <p>According to Musk, the majority of preorders (42 percent) were for the dual-motor version, while a surprising 41 percent chose the flagship tri-motor model. Finally, the entry-level single-motor variant trails far behind with a 17 percent adoption rate. Using those figures along with the 146,000 preorders, we can deduce that Tesla is looking at roughly $8 billion dollars in [potential] sales just from these preorders; that is if everyone decides to keep their order in play. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cybertruck Single-Motor, $39,990 base price: $990,000,000 in orders</li>
        <li>Cybertruck Dual-Motor, $49,990 base price: $3 billion in orders</li>
        <li>Cybertruck Triple-Motor, $69,990 base price: $4.18 billion in orders</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We should note, however, that <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/tesla">Tesla</a> is currently only requesting a $100 refundable deposit for preorders, meaning that it is sitting on $14.6 million (basically a no-interest loan).</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> features a driving range of 250 miles to over 500 miles depending on the configuration. The most expensive model, the $69,990 Triple-Motor configuration, can go 0-60 in less than 3 seconds and tow over 14,000 pounds. According to <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, production will begin in late 2021 if all goes according to plan.</p>
