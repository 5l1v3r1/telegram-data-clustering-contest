      <p>Voters in<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/uruguay.html"> Uruguay</a> are heading to the polls in a presidential election that appears likely to sweep the right-leaning opposition into power and end the centre-left's 15-year rule.</p>
      <p>In the lead-up to Sunday's vote, conservative opposition candidate Luis Lacalle Pou led the opinion polls against ruling party candidate Daniel Martinez after striking key coalition deals following a first-round vote in October.</p>

      <p>Those alliances with mostly conservative parties might prove key -  Lacalle Pou came second in the October 27 poll with around 29 percent of the vote, behind Martinez's Broad Front with 39 percent.</p>
      <p>The polling stations will open at 8am (11:00 GMT) and close at 19:30 (22:30 GMT). Some 2.6 million voters are eligible to vote.</p>
      <p>The next president will take office in March for five years. </p>
      <h3>Progressive government </h3>
      <p>The Broad Front, a coalition of leftist movements, can point to a record of progressive government since it broke a decades-long conservative stranglehold in 2005.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/uruguay.html">Uruguay</a> stood out on the international stage by approving abortion and gay marriage, as well as pioneering the legalisation of cannabis in 2013.</p>
      <p>But Lacalle Pau has tapped in to voter concerns over the country's high tax rates, promising to look elsewhere to raise the $900m needed to reduce the public deficit, nearly five percent of GDP.</p>
      <p>"Uruguay can't bear any more taxes," he told supporters.</p>
      <p>Security has also declined, with a sharp rise in some violent crimes reported last year.</p>
      <p>In 2018, South America's second-smallest country registered a record 414 murders, up 45 percent on the year before.</p>
      <p>"Lacalle is the president who can improve the country, change what Broad Front did wrong economically and especially security," said Mariela Barcia, a 51-year-old teacher who voted for the conservative candidate in October.</p>
