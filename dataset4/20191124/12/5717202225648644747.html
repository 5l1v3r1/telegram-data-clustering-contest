      <h1>Sunderland fans think they have a new first-team star in Benji Kimpioka</h1>
      <h2>Benji Kimpioka now has three Sunderland goals to his name.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:45:23+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland youngster Benji Kimpioka rescued a late point in the 1-1 draw with Coventry City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Coventry travelled to The Stadium of Light and took the lead through Dom Hyam’s header. But Kimpioka drew Sunderland level late into the game and ensured the points were shared.</p>
      <p>Kimpioka has had to wait for his opportunity this year but is now off the mark in 2019/20. The Sweden youth international popped up in the box to slot home after Coventry were unable to clear their lines.</p>

      <p>It was Kimpioka’s first league goal and he has two other senior strikes to his name. But now, Sunderland fans want to see more of their promising academy product.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old injected some much-needed pace and urgency to Sunderland’s attack when he came on. Will Grigg struggled against Coventry’s defence but Kimpioka showed his class.</p>
      <p>Sunderland fans have high hopes for Kimpioka and believe Phil Parkinson should throw him into the deep end with some league starts. Here are some tweets discussing his goal and performance against Coventry in League One.</p>
