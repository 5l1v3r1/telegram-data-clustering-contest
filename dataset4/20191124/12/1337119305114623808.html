      <h1>Tesla already has over 200,000 preorders for its divisive Cybertruck</h1>
      <h2>‘With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement,’ Elon Musk says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:55:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-j-hawkins" target="_blank">Andrew J. Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Two days after its big (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-physics-analysis-of-teslas-shattered-cybertruck-windows/">and slightly botched</a>) unveiling, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date">Cybertruck</a> is already racking up a lot of interest. Tesla had received 146,000 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977320/tesla-cybertruck-preorder-how-to-buy-online-price-date-electric-truck-pickup">preorders</a> for the electric pickup truck as of Saturday, later increasing to 200,000, Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">tweeted on Sunday</a>. And with customers dropping $100 refundable deposits for each preorder, that’s a cool $20 million for Tesla’s bank account in just 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Tesla is offering three versions of the truck: single motor rear-wheel drive with 250 miles of range for $39,900; dual motor all-wheel drive with 300 miles of range for $49,900; and tri motor all-wheel drive with 500 miles of range for $69,900. Musk said that 42 percent of preorders are dual motor, 41 percent tri motor, and 17 percent single motor.</p>

      <p>“With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement,” Musk said in a follow up tweet.</p>
      <p>Customers preordering the Cybertruck will have to wait a while before the boxy pickup pulls into their driveways, though. Production on the single and dual-motor versions won’t begin until late 2021, while the tri-motor truck won’t roll off the assembly line until late 2022.</p>
      <p>Tesla uses preorders for its forthcoming vehicles to generate excitement and provide a short-term revenue infusion, which helps provide a cushion for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928982/tesla-q4-earnings-profit-model-3-china-gigafactory">cash-strapped automaker</a>. And Musk likes to tout preorder numbers as a way to juice even more sales. For example, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/2/11353146/tesla-model-3-preorder-update-elon-musk-tweet">received 276,000 preorders</a> for the Model 3 a few days after its unveiling in 2016; two days later that number <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/7/11385146/tesla-model-3-preorders-375000-elon-musk">grew to 325,000</a>.</p>
      <p>To be sure, Tesla doesn’t always release its preorder numbers. The company has yet to reveal how many customers have put down deposits for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266750/tesla-model-y-suv-preorders-live-how-to">the Model Y</a>, its electric crossover that it revealed last March.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck is no Model 3 or Model Y, but the respectable number of preorders indicates that Tesla still has its fair share of early adopters. That said, the <i>Blade Runner</i>-inspired design of the truck has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20975725/love-hate-telsa-cybertruck-design">wildly polarizing</a>, with social media spilling over with jokes at the truck’s expense.</p>
