      <h1>Phil Parkinson feeling the pressure at Sunderland as he struggles to find the answers</h1>
      <h2>Phil Parkinson has managed just two wins in his first ten games in charge of Sunderland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:26:10+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Johns</a></address>
      <p>He puts a brave face on it, but you can be sure that Phil Parkinson is feeling the strain at Sunderland already.</p>
      <p>Just like Jack Ross before him, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> is struggling to find the answers to get this Sunderland squad firing - Saturday's 1-1 draw with Coventry City at the Stadium of Light was the eighth time in his ten games in charge that he's failed to find a way to come away with victory.</p>
      <p>Early signs of improvements have quickly dispersed, the players look short of confidence or the character to pull themselves out of their current slump.</p>
      <p>Parkinson is struggling to find the answers - with the new manager bounce the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> board hoped for when they sacked Ross last month not coming. Sunderland have gone backwards. Out of all three cups, they're now tenth in League One, 13 points off top spot.</p>
      <p>For the new manager, not happy with the balance in his squad, the answers to his problem lie in what the club can do in the January transfer window. Talk is of five new players arriving.</p>
      <p>The trouble is, Sunderland have to get to January still in touching distance, and performances, and results, like Saturday against Coventry, will not see that a reality. Keep going as they are and the play-offs might be the only realistic prospect by the time the January window shuts. That, quite frankly, is not good enough.</p>
      <p>The fact they had to rely on a teenage forward to come off the bench and rescue a point for them in a game where their only other outlet for a goal looked like a long-range Aiden McGeady effort, is telling of where the players are mentally right now. They're fragile, and it's showing.</p>
      <p>The game was very much typical of Sunderland right now. They started well. They still lacked invention or creativity in the final third, but were building a strong foothold in the match.</p>
      <p>McGeady ought to have been awarded a penalty inside the opening quarter of an hour when he was fouled just inside the area as he beat a man with his trademark feint to shoot. The referee gave nothing, but the higher intensity that Sunderland started with in comparison to their four recent cup games at least had the crowd lifted.</p>

      <p>Then disaster struck in the 25th minute - and so typically of Sunderland they shot themselves in the foot.</p>
      <p>Chris Maguire, who had another torrid afternoon, was the guilty party. His most penetrative pass of the afternoon just happened to be a back-pass which unwittingly played Amadou Bakayoko in - the Sky Blues striker who looked dangerous all afternoon. Alert to the danger, ex-Coventry man Lee Burge was off his line quick to make a block and concede a corner. The danger was not averted though. Dominic Hyam headed home from the resulting set-piece and all of the home side's early work was undone with one silly, sloppy pass.</p>
      <p>What was so concerning was what followed after.</p>
      <p>The Sunderland players crumbled. All of their early momentum evaporated, and their passing was shocking. Sloppy pass after sloppy pass. What was worse was that the heads, every single one of them, dropped.</p>
      <p>The only fight shown was that of Maguire when he tussled with a player and coach of Coventry on the sideline. It didn't look clever, with the fourth official so close by.</p>
      <p>On the pitch though, things were flat. No response after the break, nothing.</p>
      <p>McGeady had Sunderland's only chance of the second 45. His trademark cut inside, drop the shoulder, beat the man and strike could only bring a smart save out of Coventry shot-stopper Marko Marosi. Beyond that, Sunderland lacked any cutting edge.</p>
      <p>Then in the 82nd minute Parkinson made his final throw of the dice. A big call in the circumstances, Will Grigg off, 19-year-old Benji Kimpioka on. Truth be known, the youngster would not even be on the bench if the squad wasn't so threadbare with injuries right now. In many respects, it was a change that reeked of desperation - not that Parkinson will admit that after it yielded the required result.</p>
      <p>Coventry tired as Sunderland continued to press in search of the late goal, it never looked likely until the ball found Kimpioka in a good position in the penalty area in the 90th minute. A bit of pinball eventually saw Grant Leadbitter take it under control and lay a five-yard ball sideways where the young Swede stood unmarked. He showed the composure required to earn a point - not enough to stop yet more boos arriving when the full-time whistle sounded.</p>
      <p>Fans are frustrated. That was not good enough. A great moment for young Kimpioka, but not good enough from Sunderland overall. Not good enough for a side who consider themselves promotion favourites.</p>
      <p>Coventry arrived at the Stadium of Light unbeaten in five, but yet to win away from home all term. They came within a whisker at the Stadium of Light, and they would have thoroughly deserved it too.</p>
      <p>Burton are next up for Sunderland and it's now without doubt must win. Parkinson is feeling the pressure. He needs to find some answers before January, because January might be too late.</p>
