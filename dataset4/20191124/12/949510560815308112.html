      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The Coast Guard has suspended operations of some New York Waterway ferries over safety discrepancies.</p>
      <p>The agency says all 32 vessels in the company’s fleet were inspected over the last week, with 23 vessels taken out of operation.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard on Sunday said six of those suspended vessels have been put back in service.</p>
      <p>Petty Officer John Hightower, a spokesman for the agency, says the inspections of the entire fleet came after regular annual inspections found issues with fire safety and other emergency systems that hadn’t been resolved.</p>
      <p>NY Waterway spokesman Patrick Smith says the company is working with the Coast Guard to address the issues as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>He says some delays are expected for Monday morning.</p>
