        <b>A photo of Billy the Kid, never before made public, could fetch $1 million at auction.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taken in 1877, the rare black-and-white image shows the notorious Irish American outlaw sitting around a table playing cards with his gang - Richard Brewer, Fred Waite, and Henry Brown.</p>
      <p>It is the second-confirmed photograph of Billy the Kid, who was also known as William H. Bonney. (His birth name was Henry McCarty.)</p>
      <p>In the image, he is seen dressed in a white shirt, dark waistcoat and top hat, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7706121/Black-white-photo-Billy-Kid-playing-cards-gang-set-fetch-1m-auction.html">the Daily Mail reports.</a></p>

      </p>
      <p>At the time of the photo, Billy the Kid was wanted for killing a blacksmith in Arizona. It is believed he went on to kill another seven men during the Lincoln County War in 1878, including Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady.</p>
      <p>He was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett on July 14, 1881.</p>
      <p>The tintype photograph, which comes in a cream leather frame, has never before been seen by the public because it has been kept for over a century by the same family.</p>
      <p>The picture was given to the vendor’s grandfather by the widow of David Anderson, better known as Billy Wilson. </p>

      <p>Wilson became a member of Billy the Kid’s gang after riding alongside him during the Lincoln County War. </p>
      <p>Wilson received a presidential pardon in 1896 and went on to serve as sheriff of Terrell County and later worked as a US customs inspector.  </p>
      <p>Billy the Kid entrusted Wilson with the photo safe prior to his death.</p>
      <p>When Wilson died, his widow gave the photo to the vendor’s grandfather, who was Billy Wilson’s second cousin.</p>
      <p>In a letter describing the photograph's history, vendor Tomas R. Anderson II wrote: “When my grandfather and family went to pay their respects to the widow of David Anderson at his 1918 funeral, she gifted him, with among other items, a small leather family photograph album.</p>
      <p>“She explained to my grandfather's family about the history of the photograph and how Billy had gifted the photo to her husband.” </p>
      <p>The photograph has been verified by the George Eastman Museum in Texas and will go up for auction at Sofe Design Auctions of Richardson, near Dallas, Texas.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Sofe Design said: "This is a historically important, incredibly rare and one-of-a-kind.</p>

      <p>"It also possesses meticulous and irrefutable Anderson family provenance dating back three generations.</p>
      <p>"It has never been seen before and nor has it been publicly offered for sale."</p>
