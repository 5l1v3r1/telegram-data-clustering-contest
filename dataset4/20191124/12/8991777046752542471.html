      <p>Former Arsenal player Paul Merson has reacted negatively to Jose Mourinho’s appointment at Tottenham Hotspur.<br/> <br/>Daniel Levy took the decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday evening after five and a half years in charge in North London with Mourinho confirmed as his successor less than a day later.<br/> <br/>Mourinho took charge of Spurs for the first time yesterday afternoon and guided his side to a 3-2 victory away to West Ham United.<br/> <br/>Merson has suggested that history tells us that Mourinho will not be a long term appointment in North London.<br/> <br/>Pochettino laid the foundations during his five year spell at the club where he qualified for the Champions League in four occasions, including an appearance in last season’s final against Liverpool.<br/> <br/>Instead, Merson believes that the appointment of the Portuguese is a knee jerk reaction at the risk of missing out on qualification for European football’s most prestigious club competition.<br/> </p>
      <p>“There is no doubt he (Mourinho) is still a very good manager. But I still cannot believe that he is the new Tottenham boss,” <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/paul-merson-column-jose-mourinho-20938245">Merson wrote in the Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>“I cannot see the plan behind this, it is simply a quick fix. Spurs have panicked because they are worried they won’t qualify for the Champions League next season.</p>
      <p>“There is no project, there is no plan – it’s simply get us in the Champions League because we have to balance the books. I just don’t know where this is going with Mourinho.”</p>
