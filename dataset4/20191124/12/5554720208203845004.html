      <p>Ajit Pawar had taken oath of office as the new deputy chief minister of Maharashtra on Saturday after the BJP pulled off a political coup in the second-largest state of India. Sharad Pawar had distanced himself from his nephew’s decision to align with the BJP before removing him as the leader of the NCP’s legislature party.</p>
      <p>The NCP moved the Supreme Court challenging Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s decision to allow the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra. The party told the top court on Sunday that 41 out of 56 NCP MLAs were against Ajit Pawar’s decision to join hands with the BJP.</p>
      <p>However, in his subsequent tweet, Ajit Pawar on Sunday said that Sharad Pawar remained his leader and the NCP-BJP alliance will provide a stable government in the state. He wrote, “I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb is our leader. Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable Government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the State and its people.”</p>

      <p>Ajit Pawar’s tweet suggested that the alliance with the BJP had taken place with the blessings of Sharad Pawar. The veteran founder of NCP took to Twitter rejecting Ajit Pawar’s claims and accusing him of trying to cause confusion. He tweeted, “There is no question of forming an alliance with @BJP4Maharashtra. NCP has unanimously decided to ally with @ShivSena &amp; @INCMaharashtra to form the government. Shri Ajit Pawar’s statement is false and misleading in order to create confusion and false perception among the people.”</p>
