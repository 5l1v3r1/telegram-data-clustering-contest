      <p>Kim Kardashian not only supports Kanye West's bid for the presidency in 2024, but she's also actually preparing to be the First Lady.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Kim Kardashian is "ready for anything" when it comes to husband Kanye West's career ambitions - including running for the U.S. presidency in 2024.</p>
      <p>The rapper announced his planned political venture during his appearance at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in New York earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Speaking to U.S. TV show 'Extra" while promoting her Skims shapewear collection, reality TV star and budding lawyer Kim confessed she's totally on board with his plans.</p>
      <p>“I would be ready for anything. I always am," she said of the prospect of being the First Lady of the United States.</p>
      <p>Kim also spoke about her husband's recent Sunday Service gospel performance with famed pastor and televangelist Joel Osteen, calling it "amazing" and "so major,” and gushed she's proud of the Jesus Is King star for finding his spirituality.</p>
      <p>“I think everyone has their own personal journey and growth and I'm really happy that he (has), you know, found his calling and what he really believes in," the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star gushed. “It's funny, I'll look back at interviews that he's done maybe 10 years ago where he said, 'I really want to start a church…' He really made all of his dreams come true. What he really wanted to do. And that just makes me happy.”</p>
