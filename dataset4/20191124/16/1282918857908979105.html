      <p>In January this year, Income-Tax raids in Sandalwood had taken the film industry by storm. Ten months later, it is Tollywood that is at the receiving end. Renowned Telugu film production banner Ramanaidu Studio, owned by the Daggubati family, and Nani have been ‘raided’, as per latest reports. Nagarjuna, another well-known name in the industry, too has got embroiled in the row. He, however, clarified that there were no truth to raids being carried out on him or his offices. The Telugu superstar said that his well-wishers were contacting him to know about the raids, but it was ‘news’ to him. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter on Friday, Nagarjuna wrote, “Quite a few of my friends Have been calling me and asking me if I had raid from the income tax department!! This is news to me no such raid has happened on me or my offices. FYI”. (sic)</p>
      <h3>Here's the tweet:</h3>

      <p>A few days ago, reports of I-T raids at the Daggubati Studios in Hyderabad had surfaced. The raids have been conducted over alleged tax evasion. <i>Baahubali </i>star Rana Daggubati's father Suresh Babu is connected to the banner. It was then reported that the latter was not in India. Rana Daggubati, meanwhile, featured in the Bollywood hit <i>Housefull 4 </i>last month. He had played a monstrous character in one of the tracks of the comedy.     </p>
      <p>Nani, known for hits like SS Rajamouli’s <i>Eega </i>and <i>Jersey</i>, too has been in the centre of the row. Reports claim that there were raids at his office too. These celebrities, however, have not responded to the controversy yet. Like Nani, <i>Kolar Gold Fields KGF </i>star Yash was linked to the controversial raids in Sandalwood earlier this year. He had then claimed that he was not afraid of it since he had not done anything wrong. </p>

      <p>Nagarjuna, meanwhile, was recently in the news for the Akkineni Nagaswara Rao Awards, an annual felicitation event held in the memory of his late actor-producer father. Almost all members of the family, including Amala Akkineni, Naga Chaitanya and Akhil Akkineni were present at the event. Rekha and Sridevi were honoured at the event, while Chiranjeevi was among the stars who graced the event. On the professional front, Nagarjuna is set to return to Bollywood with <i>Brahmastra </i>next year. </p>
