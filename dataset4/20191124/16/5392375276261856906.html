      <p>A new mysterious device just hit the servers of China’s certification site TENAA. The handset is produced by phone maker Vivo and comes with the model name “V1936AL”.</p>
      <h3>Vivo V1936AL Spotted on TENAA, New iQoo Neo Variant on the way?</h3>

      <p>According to the certificate, the upcoming Vivo “V1936AL” will be featuring an averagely sized 6.38-inch display; we don’t know whether AMOLED or LCD. That is around the same screen size of the Vivo iQoo Neo Series launched in July and August of this year, which could suggest the handset could be part of the same lineup.</p>
      <p>In the listing we also find out the capacity of the integrated battery which will be 4420mAh. Once again, very similar to the iQoo Neo series featuring slightly larger 4500mAh juice packs.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile as far as dimensions are concerned, the Vivo V1936AL will be 159.53 × 75.23 × 8.13 mm. And well, not to be repetitive but these are the exact same dimensions we find on the Vivo iQoo Neo and <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/27/iqoo-neo-855-national-treasure-edition-released-in-china/">iQoo Neo 855.</a></p>
      <p>Now, since the phone with model name “V1938T” has been proven to be the Vivo X30 5G Edition and we know the device is launching on December 16th, we could assume the Vivo “V1936AL” will be unveiled at the same event. Could it be a new variant of Vivo iQoo Neo? Maybe powered by a MediaTek or Samsung Exynos CPU? We’ll have to wait to find out.</p>
      <p>What do you guys think off a Vivo iQOO with a MediaTek or Exynos CPU? Would you be interested? Let us know in the comments down below!</p>
