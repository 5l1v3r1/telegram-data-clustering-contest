      <h1>Authorities investigate Times Square bomb threat</h1>

      <p>A social media user threatened Times Square with two pounds of explosives, sparking a “full-scale” investigation by local, state and federal authorities on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The bomb threat made against Times Square is a despicable and cowardly act meant to instill fear and panic in our community, and New Yorkers will not tolerate these scare tactics,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Sunday.</p>
      <p>The threat, which the NYPD said was not believed to be credible, was made on Reddit by a user who warned people to avoid Times Square because he was heading to the Crossroads of the World with two pounds of explosives, police sources told The Post.</p>
      <p>It was unclear when the post was made, and it could not be found Sunday morning, suggesting it was removed by the website.</p>
      <p>“There are no credible threats at this time, and these events will continue to be closely monitored,” a spokesman for the NYPD said.</p>
      <p>The governor ordered state police to work with local and federal authorities “to launch a full-scale investigation into this incident.”</p>
      <p>Police will increase patrols in Midtown on Sunday, officials said.</p>
