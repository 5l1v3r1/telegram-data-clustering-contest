      <h1>Google Pixel Slate now as low as $450 ($350 off), keyboard and pen included</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:31:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Pixel Slate probably wasn't the wild success that Google hoped for, so much so that the company has <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/20/report-google-gives-up-on-making-its-own-tablets/">given up on future Chrome OS tablets</a>. Still, the Pixel Slate has its fans, and it just got its software support <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/05/google-gives-most-chromebooks-an-extra-year-of-software-support/">extended to June 2026</a>. Now you can grab every model of the Slate for $350 off, and Google is throwing in a free pen and keyboard.</p>
      <p>Each variant of the Slate is $350 off right now, making the cheapest base model (equipped with an Intel Core m3 CPU and 8GB RAM) $450 instead of $800. Higher-end models with a Core i5 or Core i7 processors are also available, with up to 16GB RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>

      <p>Google is also throwing in a free Pixelbook pen (normally $99) and a keyboard as part of the deal. The Google Store lets you pick between the first-party keyboard cover ($199) and the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/brydges-g-type-keyboard-will-make-pixel-slate-conventional-laptop/">Brydge G-Type Keyboard</a> ($159.99), but other stores will only give you the pen and Slate Keyboard.</p>
      <p>You can check out the sale at the link below. The offer ends December 4th, and it can't be combined with any other offers (presumably including the <a href="https://google-pixel-slate.connect.studentbeans.com/">10% student discount</a>).</p>
