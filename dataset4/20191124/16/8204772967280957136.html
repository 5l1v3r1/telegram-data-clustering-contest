      </p>
      <p>A storming last quarter helped Borris-Ileigh crown a memorable year for Tipperary hurling by defying the odds to lift only their second Munster club title in difficult conditions at Pairc Ui Rinn on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ballygunner, who were appearing in their 11th final, looked the more likely side, when holding a 0-10 to 0-7 advantage, which was quite sizeable given the game was affected by incessant rain with the floodlights on for the 2pm start.</p>
      <p>But, the tie turned in the 45th minute with the opening goal, tucked away impressively by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kieran+Maher">Kieran Maher</a> after Ray McCormack sent him clear with a telling pass.</p>
      <p>It brought the sides level for the sixth time and was a huge boost to Borris-Ileigh, who had struggled up front up to then.</p>
      <p>The inspirational <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Brendan+Maher">Brendan Maher</a> then fired over a magnificent point, showing a fierce determination to beat two opponents to the loose ball before finding the range from the left.</p>
      <p>Borris-Ileigh were now in front for the only the second time, having opened the scoring through Niall Kenny in the first minute. And they received a further boost with Kevin Maher’s surging run, which drew the foul, leading to Maher’s sixth point and a 1-9 to 0-10 lead with 10 minutes’ regulation time remaining.</p>
      <p>However, Ballygunner, who had lost eight previous finals, replied in the style of champions. Former soccer player <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Dessie+Hutchinson">Dessie Hutchinson</a> spotted Barry O’Sullivan all alone and his finish to the net decorated the glorious cross-field pass.</p>
      <p>At this point the Waterford champions crept back ahead, 1-10 to 1-9, but there was plenty of time left for more drama and excitement. Borris-Ileigh restored parity for the seventh time with a Jerry Kelly point only for Conor Sheahan to nudge Ballygunner ahead again, 1-11 to 1-10, in the 54th minute. That proved their last score, however.</p>
      <p>Within a couple of minutes, Maher’s sixth point and his fourth free, had the Borris-Ileigh contingent in the 2,663 attendance in full voice, tied yet again at 1-11.</p>
      <p>The winning point came two minutes from the end of the hour, Maher pointing from a close-range free after Kenny won a great ball in the air and was then fouled.</p>
      <p>Even with three minutes’ additional time, the holders couldn’t find a way back, leaving Borris-Ileigh in dream-land at the final whistle.</p>
      <p>In the opening half the sides were level five times inside the opening 18 minutes before Ballygunner opened a gap by claiming four of the next five scores to lead by 0-9 to 0-6 at the interval.</p>
      <p>Hutchinson was the stand-out figure in the period, scoring three points from play, though Kelly’s point from a sideline cut in the 15th minute showed what the Tipp champions were capable of producing in demanding conditions.</p>
      <p>Ballygunner hit three in-a-row with Hutchinson accounting for two and the hard-working Paddy Leavy the other as they turned around three clear.</p>
      <p>Scoring became more problematic on the change of ends with both defences on top and a fierce battle continuing in a congested middle third.</p>
      <p>The third quarter yielded just two scores, a Maher free cancelled out by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pauric+Mahony">Pauric Mahony</a>, but the tie exploded into life with Kieran Maher’s goal as Borris-Ileigh lifted their game to new heights to be deservedly crowned provincial champions.</p>
