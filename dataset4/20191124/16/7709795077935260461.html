        <b>Jason Kiely speaks to jockey Theo Chevillard ahead of his ride on today's big-race favourite Edgeoy. Also Olivier d’Andigné on progressive hurdler Cotée Sud</b>
      </p>
      <h3>On the Edge of greatness</h3>
      <p>With the year almost finished at Auteuil racecourse, we have time for one final ‘Super Sunday’ card at the spectacular Parisian track where over €960,000 prize money has been put on offer for the eight races. The ground described as ‘very heavy’.</p>
      <p>The highlight is the Grade Two Prix Georges Courtois, a race that has been won by some fantastic champions over the years including Bel La Vie and Remember Rose. Although today's eight-strong field may be lacking the presence of an established star, it may be a case of discovering a new one as <b>Edgeoy </b>lines-up as favourite for this prestigious chase.</p>
      <p>A hugely impressive winner when making all the running and jumping his rivals into submission in the Prix Heros XII just over a month ago, the François Nicolle trained five-year-old has been in fantastic form since returning from his summer break and his jockey Theo Chevillard (who replaces the suspended Angelo Zuliani) suggests the best could be yet to come</p>
      <p>“Edgeoy is going well at home, he has come out of his race well from the last day and we have freshened him up nicely, hopefully well will see him progress again this weekend he is a very nice horse for the upcoming years,” said the jockey.</p>

      <p>PRIX HÉROS XII 2019 | Edgeoy | Auteuil | Groupe 3</p>
      <p>Although the very heavy ground is somewhat of an unknown for all runners, Chevillard is sure that the son of Saddle Maker should handle the extreme conditions</p>
      <p>“I can't see the ground being a problem to him, it was soft enough when he won here the last time. We work them on a deep surface in the morning at home also so that helps."</p>
      <p>Quite often blinkered, Edgeoy is assisted once again by the headgear this afternoon and should take up his usual front running role explains the jockey</p>
      <p>“He has the blinkers back on again today, I think we will roll along in front as he likes to do, I know that there are others in the race that will try to do the same thing but we will all have a chat beforehand and try to keep it as simple as possible.".</p>
      <p>François Nicolle completed a famous six-timer at Compiegne on Friday (which Chevillard was part of when winning on The Revenant) and will be crowned champion French jumps trainer for a second time at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Chevillard has become an integral player in the Nicolle operation and explains that it's very much a team effort.</p>
      <p>“We all work hard in the mornings here and it really is a team effort, it can get difficult in the winter months but it’s worth it. We are having a great season with plenty of big winners, the rides are all shared around and the boss gives plenty of chances. I’m starting to get associated with some very nice horses, hopefully it can continue,” said the promising jockey</p>
      <p>Of the other runners in the race there is a lot to like about the David Cottin trained <b>Dalahast</b>, who was travelling quite strongly at the head of the field when unseating his jockey Kevin Nabet at the Rail and Ditch fence in the Grade One Prix La Haye Jousselin when last seen. The unexposed six-year-old is already a four time chase winner at Auteuil from only ten lifetime starts and demands the upmost respect in this field.</p>
      <h3>Paul's Saga can prove best in hurdle finale</h3>
      <p>Without the presence of title holder and crack hurdler Galop Marin, the Prix Leon Olry-Roederer looks a closely knit affair and re watching the Grade One Grand Prix D’Automne is strongly advised.</p>
      <p>David Cottin’s incredible start to his training career could receive another major boost as <b>Paul’s Saga</b> takes a steps back down in Grade this afternoon and looks to be the one they all have to beat in the 4,300m contest.</p>
      <p>The five-year-old daughter of Martaline was left with a lot of work to do when turning to the straight in the D’Automne before running on strongly to finish an eye-catching second when ridden for the first time by Kevin Nabet (who rides again today). It is hard to see either <b>Bergerac </b>or<b> Agrapart</b> reversing the form with Paul’s Saga on that run and if ridden closer to the pace, the Cottin recruit should prove difficult to beat and continue on her upward curve.</p>

      <p>GRAND PRIX D'AUTOMNE 2019 | Galop Marin | Auteuil | Groupe 1</p>
      <p>Both coming into the race with slight question marks are the Anne-Sophie Pacault-trained <b>Bosseur</b> and the François Nicolle-trained <b>Srelighonn</b>. The multiple Grade One placed Bosseur made a satisfactory return to racing last month when finishing second in a conditions hurdle after more than two years on the sidelines and assuming all is well with the eight-year-old after that run, he would have to hold place claims at least as he comes into the race one of the highest rated and runs off a mark of 74 (163 in UK).</p>
      <p>Theo Chevillard this time takes over from the suspended Gaetan Masure on former Grade One winner Srelighonn, who was a winner on his most recent start at Moulins but has only been seen six times in the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>An extremely highly rated chaser (79/174 in UK), Srelighonn reverts back to hurdles once again this afternoon and according to his jockey is ‘very fresh and should hold a good chance if all goes to plan’</p>
      <h3>The ‘d’Andigné &amp; Sud’ dream team</h3>
      <p>Young jockeys taking well deserved chances seems to be the order of the day and 21-year-old rider Olivier d’Andigné is planning on grabbing his opportunity with both hands.</p>
      <p>The young pilot, who is attached to the powerful yard of Arnaud Chaillé-Chaillé, takes the reins on favourite <b>Cotee Sud</b> in the Grade Three Prix Andre Michel.</p>
      <p>In a race that Royan-based trainer Chaillé-Chaillé has won twice in the past, Cotee Sud looks to come into this afternoon's event in excellent form having most recently finishing second in the Gradep One Prix Renaud Du Vivier. According to her jockey she has an excellent chance</p>
      <p>"That was an incredible run behind l’Autonomie, it’s all we could have hoped for. On paper we really do have a great chance this weekend although we need to not forget <b>Sainte Saone</b> or even <b>Byzance Du Berlais</b> who finished just behind us the last day," said d’Andigné.</p>
      <p>Although she was ridden from off the pace with a view to achieving the best possible finishing place on her Grade One debut last time out, the jockey suggests a return to more regular tactics will be applied in today’s conditions.</p>
      <p>"I think that we are going to ride her a lot closer to the pace this weekend, its not the same level of race so I will try and take a place just behind the leader I think. When we won the second time at Auteuil I let her go on in front, we will try and keep it fairly uncomplicated," said the jockey.</p>
      <p>"I think that the ground will be even heavier again this weekend but for her that shouldn’t be a problem, her sire Lord du Sud gets many that go on this ground," added the 21-year-old.</p>
      <p>Having ridden her in all six of her career starts d’Andigné explains that the four-year-old has surprised him and connections with her rapid progress through the ranks and with 18 winners from only 87 rides this season the young rider is operating at a very respectable strike-rate and hopes that his association with Cotee Sud can lead to further success in a promising career.</p>
      <p>“In the springtime we were thinking that she could be a pretty interesting filly, but since she has come back in the Autumn we have realised what we have here, she could be very good and hopefully we can win some good races together," he added.</p>
      <p>"It’s very important to progress and to find a horse like her is great, we all need those horses to take us to the top level."</p>
