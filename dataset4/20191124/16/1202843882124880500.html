      <p>Doha: Doha Jewellery and Watches Exhibition (DJWE) 2020 will take place between February 24 and 29, organisers announced today.</p>
      <p>The 17th edition of the exhibition is organised by Qatar National Tourism Council (QNTC) and will build on a sparkling legacy, following last year’s edition which saw nearly 500 brands from over 10 countries participate, attracting nearly 24,000 visitors.</p>
      <p>DJWE is an annual spectacular display of global luxury brands and homegrown Qatari concepts. The event has expanded over the years to include thought provoking conversations and opportunities for aficionados to learn about the craft of jewellery and watch making. DJWE 2019 attracted participation from top connoisseurs in the field, including Tiffany’s head gemologist, Sotheby’s Middle East jewelry expert and Artcurial International’s watch expert.</p>
      <p>Akbar Al Baker, Secretary General of Qatar National Tourism Council and GCEO of Qatar Airways, said:, “Over 17 years DJWE has evolved to become a pinnacle of the Qatari business events calendar, bringing together industry experts and jewellery aficionados, while offering unique and exclusive luxury experiences, as well as exposure to the best-in-class jewellery and watch brands. Today this event is a key part of QNTC’s vision to build enticing tourism products and events that reflect the uniqueness of Qatar and attract visitors from our target markets. We look forward to working with our partners, exhibitors and homegrown designers to offer visitors another fascinating journey of art, elegance and heritage.”</p>
      <p>DJWE is considered one of the fastest-growing events on the agenda of the global luxury business community and offers designers unique access to major players in the Qatari market. DJWE was also the launching pad for the Young Qatari Designers Initiative, held under the Patronage of His Excellency Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, Prime Minister of Qatar and Minister of Interior. The initiative showcases the talent of young Qatari designers in one dedicated pavilion, offering them a distinctive platform to exhibit and be discovered alongside the world’s most well-known brands.</p>
