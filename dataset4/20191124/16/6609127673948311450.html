      <p>Former Pussycat Doll Nicole wore stylish pink dress that showed off her abs, which she paired with a pair of silver heels.</p>
      <p>Thom and Nicole spent time together after she sent Thom's band, Try Star, home from The X Factor: Celebrity.</p>
      <p>After filming, Nicole went to burlesque themed nightclub Cirque Le Soir. She arrived at the venue just before midnight and Thom wasn't far behind, according to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/nicole-scherzinger-sizzles-pink-dress-20950170">Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>A source said: "Thom looked worse for wear when he left the nightclub after 2:30am, with liquid covering the left side of his body."</p>

      <p>Nicole reportedly left the venue at 3:30am.</p>
      <p>Show insiders previously told The Sun how the pair flirted and texted for weeks before Thom, 34, finally asked out 41-year-old singer Nicole.</p>
      <p>An ITV source said: “Thom is completely Nicole’s type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>"He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>

      <p>“And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
      <p>The source added: “They met up with friends, all had drinks, and were laughing and joking the whole night. They looked to be having the time of their lives.</p>
      <p>"They both want to focus on the series for now though, and then see what may or may not progress once the show has wrapped.</p>
      <p>"But Nicole deserves to meet someone lovely and everyone is hopeful this will work out.”</p>
