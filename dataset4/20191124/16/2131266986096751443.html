      <p>Valentine Holmes will return to the NRL in 2020, after signing with North Queensland on a six-year deal.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys wasted no time snapping up the former Cronulla flyer, inking a deal until the end of the 2025 season, 24 hours after Holmes was officially released by the NFL's New York Jets.</p>
      <p>Townsville-born Holmes, 24, is tipped to don the No.1 jersey for North Queensland, after signing the lucrative long term deal, reportedly worth almost AU$1 million a season.</p>
      <p>While known for his prowess on the wing, Holmes played most of his games in the 2018 NRL season at fullback for the Sharks, scoring 22 tries in 26 games.</p>

      <p>"This is a wonderful signing for our club," said Cowboys director of football Peter Parr.</p>
      <p>"Val's record speaks for itself and we couldn't be more excited about securing him at the Cowboys for the next six seasons."</p>
      <p>North Queensland had spoken to Latrell Mitchell, hosting the Sydney Roosters X-factor player on a tour of their facilities just last week.</p>
      <p>But Holmes has been a long-term target for the Cowboys, who are believed to have set aside salary cap space for almost 12 months, intending to lure Holmes back to his hometown.</p>
      <p>Now Holmes has finally put pen to paper, North Queensland will hope the 2016 NRL premiership winner with Cronulla sparks their backline and breaks them out of a slump.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Holmes will provide much-needed firepower for a North Queensland side that finished third last in 2019, ensuring the former premiers have missed the finals the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>He has scored eight tries in five State of Origin games for Queensland and a remarkable 17 tries in 13 tests for Australia.</p>
      <p>Overall, Holmes has scored 66 tries in 105 NRL games since his 2014 NRL debut with Cronulla.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't long ago that Valentine was one of the best players in the competition before his courageous decision to go to the NFL," Parr said.</p>
      <p>"His form in 2018 was as good as any player in the NRL, particularly in the second half of that season.</p>
      <p>"He's a proven big-game player. He's won a Grand Final, and he's played some terrific football for both Queensland and Australia."</p>
      <p>The cashed-up deal will no doubt ease Holmes' disappointment over his failed NFL experiment.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old left the Sharks at the end of 2018 to pursue his NFL dream and spent this year in the Jets practice squad as an 'International Pathways Player'.</p>
      <p>He played in the Jets' four pre-season games, but missed out on their 53-strong player roster.</p>
      <p>Holmes' NRL return will also be music to the ears of Queensland coach Kevin Walters, whoÂ is under pressure, after NSW won the last two Origin series.</p>
      <p>Holmes has a stunning try-scoring record on the wing for the Maroons, but may yet threaten incumbent Queensland No.1 Kalyn Ponga for the fullback role in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys are yet to confirm when Holmes will start pre-season training, but will officially unveil their prized recruit at a Townsville press conference on Monday afternoon.</p>
