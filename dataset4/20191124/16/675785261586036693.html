      <h2>Unai Emery is under intense pressure at Arsenal, after the club went six game without a win this Saturday, and some fans have earmarked Mauricio Pochettino as a replacement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:34:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal fans are crying out for a new manager after another poor showing against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners went into the match looking for a first win in six games, and were favourites to take all three points against the relegation-threatened Saints at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> were lucky to pick up a point from the encounter in which Alexandre Lacazette netted an equaliser with the last kick of the game.</p>
      <p>Gunners supporters were understandably angry after the match, and Unai Emery vowed to turn things around in his press conference.</p>
      <p>Emery is not in immediate danger of being sacked, but pressure is starting to grow on the Spaniard, and a few names have cropped up as possible replacements for him.</p>

      <p>One such name is a controversial one: Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was recently sacked by Arsenal's bitter rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> after five years in charge and is without a job.</p>
      <p>Pochettino turned Spurs into regular top four contenders during his tenure, even leading them to the Champions League final last season, as Arsenal regressed.</p>

      <p>But Arsenal fans hopeful that Pochettino could soon be their new boss will be deterred by his comments from January 2018.</p>
      <p>Pochettino said: "I am never going to be manager of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> or Arsenal because I am so identified with Tottenham and Espanyol.</p>

      <p>"I grew up in Newell's Old Boys and will never manage Rosario Central. That is my decision because I prefer to work on my farm in Argentina than in some places.</p>
      <p>"But my commitment is massive in this club. I am working like I am going to be here forever. But in the end, it is like the players, you never know what is going to happen in football. It is a lot of rumours about this, about that."</p>
