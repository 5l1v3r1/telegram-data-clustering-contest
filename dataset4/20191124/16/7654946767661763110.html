      <h1>Jason Garrett prefers the Giants if he and Pat Shurmur get fired</h1>

      <p>A lot has to happen before this could come to fruition, but should the Giants fire Pat Shurmur and the Cowboys ax Jason Garrett, the latter would want to end up with the Giants, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.</p>
      <p>“My understanding is the Giants have emerged as a real and legitimate potential landing spot for Garrett,” Rapoport said Sunday <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1198611935496986624?s=20">on NFL GameDay</a>. “First of all, it is his preferred destination if he can’t stick with the Cowboys. And second, back in 2014, the Giants were trying to decide, should they fire Tom Coughlin. My understanding is they would have fired Coughlin if they could get Jason Garrett.”</p>
      <p>Garrett ended up signing a five-year, $30 million contract extension in January 2015. Coughlin stepped down as Giants coach after the 2015 season following a second consecutive 6-10 campaign.</p>
      <p>Garrett, 53, spent four seasons with the Giants from 2000-03 as a depth quarterback. Dallas enters Sunday leading the NFC East at 6-4. Under Garrett, the Cowboys have made the playoffs three of the last seven seasons but have not advanced past the Divisional Round.</p>
      <p>Shurmur, 54, is in his second season as Giants coach. The team is 2-8 entering Sunday’s game against the Bears after going 5-11 last season.</p>
