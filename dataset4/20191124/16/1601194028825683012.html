      <p>Robert Pires concedes Arsenal are "in big trouble" but is backing Unai Emery as the right coach to change their fortunes.</p>
      <p>A late goal from Alexandre Lacazette – his second of the game – salvaged a 2-2 home draw against Southampton on Saturday, with Arsenal now without a win in their last five Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>The Gunners sit a worrying eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea after just 13 games.</p>
      <p>Saturday's result piled more pressure on Emery, with Arsenal's fanbase growing increasingly restless.</p>
      <p>But Pires, who won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups during his time at Arsenal under Arsene Wenger, believes Emery can correct their dismal form.</p>
      <p>"Everybody knows at Arsenal, even Unai Emery, that they are in big trouble," Pires told Omnisport, speaking as part of the UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour driven by Nissan.</p>
      <p>"But [Emery] is a competitor, he knows the high level. He was a great manager with Sevilla, with Paris Saint-Germain, but the situation is not so good.</p>
      <p>"He is a good manager, I think he will make a success with Arsenal. I hope for him anyway. The situation isn't so good, but him and the players need to find the solution."</p>
      <p>Pires said Arsenal must still push for a top-four place, given the Champions League is where the best players want to be.</p>
      <p>He said: "The target for Arsenal and for Unai is to finish in the top four because it's very important for Arsenal to play again in the Champions League next season.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what will happen at the end of the season, especially for Arsenal. For some players - [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang, Lacazette, or even Mesut Ozil - the first thing for them and all the Arsenal players is to finish in the top four."</p>

      <p>Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham underwent managerial upheaval in midweek, with Mauricio Pochettino replaced by Jose Mourinho following a dismal start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Mourinho started his tenure with a 3-2 win at West Ham, and despite Arsenal's rivalry with Spurs, Pires is glad to see the former Manchester United and Chelsea boss back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"I think it's great news for football generally, and of course for the Premier League. Everyone knows that Mourinho is one of the best managers in the world," Pires said.</p>
      <p>"He won lots of titles: Spain, Italy, and of course in the UK. In the UK, we know there is competition between Spurs and Gunners, but this is football and I'm very sad for Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"He is a great manager, only six months ago he got to the final of the Champions League. Unfortunately for him he lost against Liverpool and now he is sacked.</p>
      <p>"So footballers or even the manager, things are tough."</p>
