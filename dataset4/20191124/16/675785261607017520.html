      <h1>DWP: Disabled people will face fewer tests for benefits in Tory manifesto vow</h1>
      <h2>Buried in the Tory election manifesto is a pledge to double the minimum Personal Independence Payment (PIP) award from 9 months to 18 months - after years of complaints about the system</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:25:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>The Tories today agreed to put disabled people through fewer tests to prove they deserve benefits if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> wins the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a>.</p>
      <p>The party's manifesto announced the minimum award for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will double from 9 to 18 months before people have to face a reassessment.</p>
      <p>The pledge, after years of complaints about people being forced through dehumanising, humiliating assessments, is set to cost £75million a year in 2020/21 if the Tories get into government.</p>
      <p>Its cost will rise to £80million a year by 2023/24.</p>
      <p>The manifesto boasts the move is "part of our efforts to empower and support disabled people" - as the Tories also finally end the freeze on working-age benefits.</p>

      <p>But it stops short of committing to any new action to help people on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> , saying only "we will do more to make sure" it works.</p>
      <p>And the manifesto does not commit to cutting the five-week wait for the first payment in UC, despite the standard period driving people to foodbanks.</p>
      <p>By comparison, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> has vowed to scrap UC and stop the "dehumanising" PIP assessments altogether.</p>
      <p>The Tory manifesto says: "As part of our efforts to empower and support disabled people, we will reduce the number of reassessments a disabled person must go through when a significant change in condition is unlikely.</p>

      <p>"Because you should not have to provide repeated proof of your disability in order to receive support."</p>
      <p>It comes after former Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd - who later resigned the Tory whip and stood down as an MP - said disabled pensioners would no longer have their PIP awards regularly reviewed.</p>
      <p>She also vowed to improve the system so fewer PIP assessments are overturned by a tribunal.</p>
      <p>Around three-quarters of tribunals for people who were denied PIP currently rule against the DWP - tens of thousands.</p>
      <p>DWP chiefs say internal appeals, known as mandatory reconsiderations, are being tightened up to gather more evidence and resolve problems before they come to tribunal.</p>
      <p>But waiting times have also exploded as cases clog the system, with the average MR taking 69 days - up from 32.</p>
