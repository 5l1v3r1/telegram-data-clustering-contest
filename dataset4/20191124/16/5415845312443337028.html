      <h1>Arsenal: The board as culpable as Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are still yet to sack head coach Unai Emery. This delay proves that the board is as culpable as the incompetent head coach for the team’s struggles.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:27:26+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/mgibbons2/" target="_blank">Marc Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>Where do we even start? What can be said that hasn’t already been said? <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a> is not the right man for the job. It is quite clear. And yet, the only people who cannot see this — or are not willing to admit to themselves that they can see it — are those on the <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> board.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/pain-in-the-arsenal-podcast-on-arsenal-fc/id1314514440?ign-mpt=uo%3D4%26amp%3Buo%3D4&amp;mt=2">Find the latest episode of the Pain in the Arsenal Podcast here — Can we talk about something else?</a>
      </p>
      <p>One thing obviously springs to mind: why do they have so much faith in Emery? What is he doing that is different to Arsene Wenger? What are the reasons in favour of the Spaniard’s management?</p>
      <p>According to the board, the fans’ recent criticisms are just ‘noise’, and that that ‘noise’ is partly to blame for the team’s struggles. But that is not the case. It is a product of the problems, not the cause of them. And now the board are accepting of those problems, not taking a stand to change them. They are allowing the club to slip into mediocrity.</p>
      <p>The board doesn’t know what to do with Emery. Some want him until the end of the season, others want to provide him with a little more time to see if the fortunes can change, others still believe that sacking him now is the right decision. The reality is that the correct call is the latter one. Emery has proven himself unable. But the club is delaying the necessary decision.</p>
      <p>It has been said before and will be said again, the club is rotten from top to bottom. And right now, there is no argument to the contrary. This is especially pertinent regarding the acceptance of underperformance on the pitch in the place of good performance off it. As long as the money is still rolling in, the people at the top are happy.</p>

      <p>There has to be a breaking point somewhere. Maybe the board will finally cave in and give the fans what they want, but the likelihood is that the breaking point will be when the fans finally decide to stay away for good and the club reaches rock bottom, financially more than from a footballing angle.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are a big club in name only. They certainly do not act like one on the pitch, and, dare I say it, their ambition is outmatched by their neighbours, who have just sacked their underperforming manager in a ruthless pursuit of titles and trophies.</p>
      <p>What will be most telling is what the club says should they stick with Emery for an extended period beyond this week. They cannot produce the same PR speak of previous years, protesting of their desire to challenge for titles, if they are also unwilling to make the necessary decisions of sacking their manager.</p>
      <p>In allowing Emery to continue in his role, the board have rightfully been brought to everyone’s attention. They are now the ones to blame, not just Emery. The whole situation makes no sense and is just dragging on needlessly.</p>
      <p>The board must pull the trigger now and at least try to salvage something from a season that is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades. They are in the spotlight, and rightfully so. Because they are now as much to blame as anyone else.</p>
