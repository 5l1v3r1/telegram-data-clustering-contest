        <b>It's no secret that <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22538041/ryan-reynolds-net-worth/">Ryan Reynolds </a>is very attached to <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28536826/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-mcu-phase-5/">Deadpool </a>, both as a character and a film series. He first played the comic book <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22815829/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-real-life-strength-superfit/">"merc with a mouth" </a>in the critically panned X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and campaigned to get a standalone movie which finally happened in 2016. Deadpool was a hit with fans and critics alike, and so a sequel was pretty much guaranteed.</b>

      <p>But according to Tim Miller, who directed the first movie, Reynolds' possessiveness drove him to leave the franchise (David Leitch stepped in to direct Deadpool 2). In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-business/terminator-dark-fate-director-on-the-bumpy-road-to-a-box-office-bomb/tim-miller-on-terminator-box-office-woes-im-processing-but-im-very-proud-of-the-movie">KCRW </a>, Miller explained how creative differences with the film's star led to his eventual departure from the series.</p>
      <p>"It became clear that Ryan wanted to be in control of the franchise," he said. "You can work that way as a director, quite successfully, but I cant. I dont mind having a debate, but if I cant win, I dont want to play. And I dont think you can negotiate every creative decision, theres too many to make. So Ryans the face of the franchise, and he was the most important component of that, by far. So if he decides he wants to control it, then hes going to control it."</p>

        <p>Miller cites that same lack of full creative control as the reason why he will probably never work with James Cameron again either, after directing this year's <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28915992/gabriel-luna-terminator/">Terminator: Dark Fate </a>. "It has nothing to do with whatever trauma I have from the experience," he said, "its more that I just dont want to be in a situation again where I dont have the control to do what I think is right."</p>
