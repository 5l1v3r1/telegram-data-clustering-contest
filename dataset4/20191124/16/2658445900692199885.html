      <p>Former militants of the Niger Delta region, under the aegis of Iduwini Volunteer Force (IVF) have called President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by one of its leaders, Johnson Biboye, the ex- agitators warned that the activities, particularly the establishment of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) to run the administration of the NDDC, of the minister are upsetting the peace in the volatile region.</p>
      <p>The group also called for the “urgent return” of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to the supervision of the presidency.</p>
      <p>Noting that it has consistently supported the anti corruption drive of President Buhari’s administration, the IVF described the three-man committee as a “smoke screen put in place to cover up huge financial atrocities that has been committed by notable figures in the Niger Delta, Chief Godswill Akpabio, inclusive.”</p>
      <p>According to the statement, President Buhari should inaugurate the recently screened board, while the services of a reputable and globally recognized accounting firm be employed for the forensic audit of the agency.</p>
      <p>Part of the statement read, “we are saddened that in spite of your administration concerted desire to ensure that the underdevelopment challenges confronting the Niger Delta region is tackled with more seriousness, we are force to report to you that activities of one of your political appointee Chief Godswill Akpabio who is currently minister of Niger Delta Affairs is threatening the fragile peace in the Niger delta region.</p>
      <p>“As critical stakeholders in the Niger Delta peace process, the leadership of the Iduwini Volunteer Force (IVF) having complied with the Federal Government Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) believes that the only thing that can return our troop back to the creeks is the type been perpetuated by your minister of Niger Delta Affairs without any control from the Government of the day.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“As a former Governor of Akwa bom State Chief Godswill Akpabio is an interested and active participant in the multi- Billion Naira fraud that has taken place in the NDDC and for such a person to be given the responsibility to superintend over such organization is not only fraudulent but an invitation to avoidable crisis</p>
      <p>“Having critically reviewed the pathetic situation the meeting resolved that federal Government under your able leadership should sack Chief Godswill Akpabio as Minister of Niger delta Affairs and urgently return the NDDC back to the Presidency to avoid selfishly motivated individuals from wanting to control the regional developmental agency.</p>
      <p>“The meeting also resolved that the already screened board of the NDDC nominated by your very self be given a matching order to resume just as you should appoint reputable and globally recognized accounting firm to carry out the proposed forensic probe.”</p>
      <p>It further stated that failure to do the needful may force them (ex-militants) to return to the creeks.</p>
      <p>“While we look forward to your early resolution of this impending avoidable crisis we want to say that our present peaceful disposition should not be taken for weakness as we are still capable of striking when we are pushed the wall,” the group stressed.</p>
