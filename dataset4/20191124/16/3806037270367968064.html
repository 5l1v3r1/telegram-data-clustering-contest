      <h1>Elon Musk Announces 146,000 Tesla Cybertrucks Have Been Preodered</h1>
      <h2>In just two days.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:50:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Marshall Jr.</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, just two days after the unveiling of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tesla-cybertruck">Tesla’s Cybertruck</a>, the automaker’s founder, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, tweeted that the company had already sold 146,000 vehicles via preorder, and because these reservations require a $100 USD <b>refundable</b> deposit, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tesla">Tesla</a> has tallied $14.6 million USD in 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Of course, there is no telling how many drivers will actually go through with the purchase of this angular electric truck, whose price ranges from $39,900 USD to $69,900 USD, but it should bring a bit of optimism to the often scrutinized company.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck has been met with a lot of skepticism and polarizing thoughts, many for it and many against, with a large number of Wall Street analysts among the latter. However, with the amount of interest in the obscure-looking car, evident by the aforementioned presale numbers, it may be safe to say Musk has another hit among his loyal followers; safer than the truck’s glass that is.</p>
