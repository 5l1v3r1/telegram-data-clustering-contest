      <h1>Revealed: Newcastle United's goal of the season so far as chosen by fans</h1>
      <h2>Hunders of votes were cast by ChronicleLive readers - and we can now reveal Newcastle United's goal of the season so far</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Knight</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United have remarkably relied on defenders for most of their goals so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have scored just 11 times in their opening 12 Premier League encounters, with centre-backs such as Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez, Jamaal Lascelles, and Fabian Schar all chipping in.</p>
      <p>But despite <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United's</a> struggles in the attacking third, Steve Bruce's side have already notched several memorable strikes for supporters to savour.</p>
      <p>We decided to select four of these and put it to a vote during the international break to see which goal would be considered the fans' favourite so far.</p>
      <p>The four contenders read as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joelinton's first United goal against Tottenham</li>
        <li>Jetro Willems' thunderbolt at Liverpool</li>
        <li>Matty Longstaff's winner against Manchester United</li>
        <li>Jonjo Shelvey's free-kick at West Ham.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hundreds of votes were cast by ChronicleLive readers, and two strikes stood out as clear favourites among supporters.</p>
      <p>But - perhaps unsurprisingly - Matty Longstaff's memorable goal against the Red Devils in front of the Gallowgate came out on top for the best goal of the season so far.</p>

      <p>The 19-year-old secured 45% of the vote - edging out Willems' surprise opener at Anfield which was backed by 42% of supporters.</p>
      <p>Shelvey's screamer at the London Stadium - which ultimately proved to be the winner for the Magpies - rounded out the podium positions after being backed by 10% of fans.</p>
      <p>Joelinton's winner at Tottenham following a 17-pass move was selected by just 4% of supporters.</p>
