      <h1>Sixty million dollars needed for Tema Sewage System replacement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:10:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Isaac Newton Tetteh, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 24, GNA - Sixty million US dollars is required in the effort to replace the entire Tema Communities Sewage System, Mr Derick Tata- Anku, the Tema Metropolitan Waste Management Director, has said.</p>
      <p>The sewage system is over 60 years-old and needed to be replaced, he said, adding that the many leakages people see in the various communities was as a result of the weakening of the pipes that carry the liquid waste to the treatment plants.</p>
      <p>Mr Tada-Anku said this in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Tema on the sidelines of an event to mark the 2019 World Toilet Day.</p>
      <p>He called on the public to report any leakage to the appropriate office for the needed action to be taken.</p>
      <p>Mr Tada-Anku also advised residents to desist from dumping other solid materials into their water closets; the debris blocks most of the liquid waste from flowing to the treatment plant.</p>
      <p>He expressed concern that many residents within the Metropolis were not paying their sewer fees and this has made the management of the sewer system a challenge.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have the resources to change the entire sewage system now so help us to manage it,” he said.</p>
