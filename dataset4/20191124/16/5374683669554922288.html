      <h2>US Supreme Court's oldest justice taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital after suffering from fever and chills, possibly from an infection.</h2>

      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was admitted to a hospital on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore after a bout of chills and fever earlier on Friday, a Supreme Court spokesman said on Saturday, according to the New York Times. She was being evaluated and treated for possible infection.</p>
      <p>She received intravenous antibiotics and fluids, and could be released as early as Sunday morning, spokeswoman, Kathleen Arberg, said.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg returned to the bench on Monday, after missing courtroom arguments on Nov. 13 for what a court spokesperson said was a stomach virus.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Ginsburg participated in the regular closed-door conference with other justices, Arberg said. She then stayed at the court until midday before she went to a meeting outside the court where she started feeling ill.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, underwent treatment in August for “a localized malignant tumor” on her pancreas. She had surgery last year to remove a cancerous growth from her left lung, her third bout with cancer.</p>
      <p>She is one of three Jewish justices on the court and leads its liberal minority. She is the high court’s oldest justice.</p>
