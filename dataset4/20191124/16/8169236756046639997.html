      <h1>(Photo) Nicolas Pepe jokes with Arsenal after mix-up on social media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:30:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>On Friday afternoon, Arsenal’s club-record signing Nicolas Pepe joked with the club’s social media team after he mistook for teammate Ainsley Maitland-Niles.</p>
      <p>The Ivorian was pictured alongside stopper Bernd Leno during training and Arsenal’s Instagram handlers accidentally tagged Maitland-Niles into the picture – rather than Pepe.</p>
      <p>The caption of the post read “Preppin for the weekend”.</p>
      <p>The Gunners clearly didn’t do enough work as relegation candidates Southampton would’ve beat them if it wasn’t for a last-minute equaliser from Alexandre Lacazette.</p>
      <p>Pepe decided to have some fun after seeing the social media blunder and replied with ‘It’s me’, as well as emojis of a laughing face and facepalm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Instagram post was deleted shortly after the forward’s reply, but here’s some screenshots below:</b>

      <p>It appears as though the Gunners can’t stop themselves from being embarrassed both on and off the pitch. The side’s poor run of form has left their hopes of a top four finish in serious doubt.</p>
      <p>Pepe hasn’t exactly hit the ground running with the Gunners so far this season, the 24-year-old attacker has registered seven goal contributions in 16 appearances across all competitions so far this term.</p>
