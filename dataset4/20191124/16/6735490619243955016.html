      <p>Duane “Dog” Chapman is making the leap from chasing fugitives on reality television to acting in a motion picture.</p>
      <p>According to a report in <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/duane-dog-chapman-joins-faith-based-thriller-hunting-god-1202792855/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, the “Dog the Bounty Hunter” star has signed on to “Hunting God”, a faith-based thriller that will see him play himself alongside a cast that includes Ann Sonneville (“Dig Two Graves”), Mickey O’Sullivan (“The Chi”) and newcomer Wesley Truman Daniel.</p>
      <p><i>Deadline </i>describes the film as following a widower who reunites with some old friends from church, with the friends taking a hunting trip deep in the woods. There, he encounters a supernatural presence that makes him confront his faith.</p>

      <p>“This isn’t your grandfather’s faith-based film,” says director Justin Jackola of the film, which marks his feature directing debut. “Our goal is to break the mold and hopefully inspire more fresh and innovative content. We’re thrilled to have Dog on board. He brings a level of understanding and compassion to the film no one else could match.”</p>
      <p>The first part of shooting wrapped last year, with additional scenes to be filmed in December.</p>
