      <h1>Match of the Day pundits hail 'incredible' Liverpool and ask interesting question</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool were a big talking on Match of the Day after their 2-1 win at Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:39:26+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Match of the Day pundits Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy have offered their verdicts on another impressive showing of resilience and fight from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The Reds were close to dropping points in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> title race once again, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-analysis-sadio-mane-follows-17306870">only for Roberto Firmino to score in the 85th minute</a> to cancel out Wilfried Zaha's equaliser just three minutes earlier.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were not at their best but the old saying goes, winning ugly is a sign of champions.</p>
      <p>Whilst Jurgen Klopp's men are far from picking up that elusive league crown they have been searching for since 1990, both former Newcastle United man Shearer and ex-Liverpool playmaker Murphy were quick to heap praise on the Reds.</p>
      <p>"They got a little bit of luck, they didn’t really play well but the spirit, attitude and drive was incredible again," Shearer explained on Match of the Day.</p>
      <p>"Crystal Palace put in their best performance of the season. This is where they got a little bit unlucky, there is a push in there, I don’t think he’s getting to the ball anyway but the goal was ruled out.</p>
      <p>"We talk about Liverpool, this team doesn’t do defeats, they kept on going, they come back straight at them, last five minutes again, Firmino is there, tucks it away.</p>
      <p>"Again, Liverpool not playing particularly well but getting the right result."</p>
      <p>Murphy added: "Desire and character go a long way don’t they? Imagine how far away they would be if they started playing well."</p>
