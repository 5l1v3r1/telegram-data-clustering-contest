      </p>
      <p><i>Blue Story</i>, which premiered in London earlier this month, tells the story of two London friends whose lives are marred by gang violence. The film is directed by London-based filmmaker Andrew Onwubolu, known on YouTube as rap artist Rapman.</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesman told the BBC that "we can confirm a decision was made to remove the film. The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority."</p>
      <p>A witness identified as Rachael Allison said she saw a young boy "crying on the floor with his mother" as fighting broke out.</p>
      <p>"The police told everyone to leave the cinema as they held Taser guns in their hands and started to bring in guard dogs," Allison said.</p>
