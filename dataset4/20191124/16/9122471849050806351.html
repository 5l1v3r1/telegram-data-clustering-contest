      <h1>ESPN Releases Prediction For Alabama-Auburn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:30:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Rivalry Week is here. Incredibly, the college football regular season is just about over.</p>
      <p>As always, Alabama-Auburn will be one of the most anticipated games of college football’s final weekend. The Tide need to win to finish 11-1 and then hope the chips fall in their favor, enabling them to reach the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>As for Auburn, nothing would make Tigers fans happier than to see their team end Alabama’s playoff hopes for good. A win for AU would leave the Tigers with a 9-3 record, giving them a chance at a 10-win season in their bowl game.</p>
      <p>ESPN has<a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401110865"> released a prediction</a> for the Iron Bowl, using its FPI. Alabama is the favorite, but the computer is giving Auburn a decent chance of pulling an upset.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>According to the FPI, Alabama has a 65.7 percent chance of winning. Auburn, meanwhile, has a 34.3 percent chance of winning.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Alabama-Auburn will kick off at 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday on CBS.</p>
      <p>Alabama is 8-4 against AU under Nick Saban, though the Tigers did win the last time they met on “The Plains” two years ago.</p>
