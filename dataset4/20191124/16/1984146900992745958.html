      <p>Sunderland welcome Burton Albion to the Stadium of Light on Tuesday as they look to kickstart their promotion charge.</p>
      <p>Phil Parkinson's difficult start to life as Sunderland boss continued on Saturday as they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at home to Coventry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> has won just two of his opening 10 games as Black Cats boss and the draw left Sunderland in tenth place in the League One table - eight points adrift of the automatic promotion places and 13 points behind league leaders Wycombe.</p>
      <p>But a win over Burton on Tuesday would put <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> back into the play-off picture and they welcome a Brewers side that sit in 15th place in the League One table.</p>
      <p>Nigel Clough's travel to Wearside out of form themselves and are without a win in their last seven games in all competitions.</p>
