      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s exports, a key economic growth driver, are expected to grow to a record $114 billion in 2019 from $109 billion last year, government data showed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to the Central Bureau and Statistics and Economy Ministry, Israeli goods and services exports stood at $84 billion over the first nine months of the year, up 4.6% from January-September 2018.</p>
      <p>The Economy Ministry said the increase this year stems mostly from a nearly 12% rise in services exports, with growth led by the high tech sector such as software, computing and research and development services.</p>
      <p>The gain in services has more than offset weakness in goods exports, which have been hurt this year by slowing global trade, a weak diamond market, and a strong shekel currency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=ILS&amp;destCurr=USD">ILS=</a>.</p>
      <p>Exports comprise around 30% of Israel’s economic activity.</p>
      <p>Overall, exports to the European Union — Israel’s largest trading partner — rose 4.8% this year, led by the UK, Spain, Poland and Belgium. Exports to the United States — the largest export market by country — rose 2% while exports to India grew 9%. Exports to Asian markets including China and Japan fell this year.</p>
