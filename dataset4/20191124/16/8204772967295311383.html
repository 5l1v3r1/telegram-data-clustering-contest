      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:03:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/conor-lally-7.1010727" target="_blank">Conor Lally</a></address>
      <p>A man strangled to death in his cell in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Cloverhill">Cloverhill</a> Prison has been named as <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mark+Lawlor">Mark Lawlor</a> (37), a Dublin criminal with a history of mental illness.</p>
      <p>Gardaí believe the deceased was strangled after being attacked just before midnight on Friday on the B wing of the west Dublin jail.</p>
      <p>Lawlor, who has had addresses in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Ballymun">Ballymun</a> and Balbriggan, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar depression and had scores of previous convictions.</p>
      <p>A man in his 50s and known to gardaí in the north east has been arrested over the killing.</p>
      <p>The dead man was in prison arising from a theft charge and the suspect for the killing was in jail in relation to a criminal damage charge.</p>
      <p>A number of other prisoners in cells close to where the dead man was killed heard a disturbance and alerted prison staff. However, Lawlor had already been fatally injured by the time prison officers rushed into the cell and was pronounced dead in the jail a short time later.</p>
      <p>While he was in jail over non-violent crime at the time of his death, he had previously been convicted of serious crimes including possession of a knife and assault. He also had convictions for robbery and burglary</p>
      <p>In 2009, then aged 27 years and with an address at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Beldare+Green">Beldare Green</a>, Ballymun, north Dublin, he was jailed for four years for harassing and threatening a female Garda member.</p>
      <p>He had gone to gardaí in 2006 and alleged he was sexually abused by an older boy when he was aged eight years. While a garda sergeant investigated the case the DPP decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.</p>
      <p>Two years later Lawlor began threatening and harassing the investigating officer Sgt Noleen McKenna by quoting the names of known criminals and at one point told her if he had a gun he would shoot her. The sergeant was pregnant at the time and said she had to change her daily routine, phone number and home security as a result of the threats from August to October, 2008.</p>
      <h3>Investigations</h3>
      <p>Lawlor’s sentencing hearing was told he could call to Garda stations asking for her and when he was told she was not present he would become abusive.</p>
      <p>The Irish Times understands that just before midnight on Friday a prisoner in the cell next to the one where Lawlor was killed heard a disturbance and called for staff.</p>
      <p>While prison officers rushed to the scene and opened the cell, the victim had already been fatally injured.</p>
      <p>Staff tried to resuscitate the man but efforts to save his life were not successful and he was later pronounced dead in the cell.</p>

      <p>The attack occurred about four hours after prisoners had been locked into their cells for the night.</p>
      <p>In a statement the Irish Prison Service said “all practicable measures” were taken by prison management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody.</p>
      <p>“However, regrettably no prison system can be completely free of violence and inter prisoner assaults do occur,” it added.</p>
      <p>“Investigations by An <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Garda+S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na">Garda Síochána</a>, the Irish Prison Service and the office of the Inspector of Prisons are underway to establish the circumstances surrounding (Friday’s) incident.”</p>
      <p>Garda headquarters issued a statement on Saturday saying: “Shortly after midnight gardaí and emergency services were called by prison authorities following an incident involving two male prisoners in custody at the prison.</p>
      <p>“A man in his late 30s was treated by emergency services but was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later. Gardaí are following a definite line of enquiry and the investigation is ongoing.”</p>
      <p>After gardai arrived at Cloverhill Prison just after midnight into Saturday morning the cell where the killing occurred was sealed off as a crime scene and the dead man’s remains were left in situ.</p>
      <p>A preliminary examination of the body was carried out at the scene by a pathologist on Saturday before the remains were removed for full post mortem. Members of the Garda Technical Bureau also carried out an examination of the cell.</p>
