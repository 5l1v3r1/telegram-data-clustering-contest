      <h1>Chorley Council trumpets levels of investment - but opposition questions whether all parts of the borough benefit</h1>

        <b>Councillors in Chorley have clashed over competing visions for the future of the borough – and whether residents are feeling the benefit of recent major investments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ruling Labour group and Conservative opposition on Chorley Council each laid out their plans for the borough over the next three years – as well as an assessment of the twelve months gone by.</p>
      <p>Deputy council leader Peter Wilson hailed 2019 as a “year of delivery” for the authority, with the Primrose Gardens extra care scheme for elderly residents and the Strawberry Fields Digital Office Park both having opened – and the Market Walk shopping centre extension just days away from welcoming its first customers.</p>
      <p>Leader Alistair Bradley said that a recent ‘peer review’ of the council by other local authority chiefs noted that Chorley was going beyond the traditional responsibilities of a borough council – with projects such as funding flood defences for Croston, subsidising threatened bus services and the recent purchase of the TVS warehouse in Buckshaw Village.</p>
      <p>“They said they’d never seen anything like Chorley – a place where [the council]…steps in. That’s often at our own risk and they said, ‘If you do this stuff, other people will let you do it’.</p>
      <p>“But who else is going to provide these services?” Cllr Bradley asked.</p>
      <p>However, Conservative opposition leader Martin Boardman questioned the wisdom of the way in which the council is operating – and its plans to continue in the same vein.</p>
      <p>“It’s another rehash – promising so much, but changing the lives of so few. A strategy of property acquisition and so-called investments in and around our town centre.</p>
      <p>“There is a current £60m debt which our children and grandchildren will inherit when we are gone. This strategy has one common theme – borrow, borrow, borrow and spend, spend, spend,” Cllr Boardman added.</p>
      <p>Deputy Conservative group leader Debra Platt also demanded to know how the council planned to end “the disparity” between investment in urban and rural parts of the borough – which she claimed was split on a ratio of 99 percent to one percent.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the money [is generated] by the villages from the massive amounts of housing we are getting [through developer contributions towards infrastructure] – but we are not getting any facilities to go with it,” Cllr Platt said.</p>
      <p>Cllr Wilson said the Conservatives should be “ashamed” for suggesting that residents were not benefiting from the council’s investments, which he claimed offered the authority a return in the long-run.</p>
      <p>He added: “On spending, the stats say all the spend is in the town centre, because that’s where the major projects have been. If you take those projects out, you’ll see a far more even spread across villages and towns.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s corporate strategy for the district includes commitments to a vibrant town centre and villages, a strong and expanding business sector and reduced health inequalities.</p>
      <p>In what they describe as creating “clear blue water” themselves and the Labour group, the Conservatives alternative strategy pledges to create a skills hub, a scheme to support vulnerable and elderly residents and investment in sports clubs.</p>
      <p>Both parties say they will put the environment at the heart of their plans.</p>
      <p>Chorley Council will be holding an all-out election next May, when every seat will be up for grabs as a result of boundary changes within the borough.</p>
