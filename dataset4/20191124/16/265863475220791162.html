      <p>Tamar Braxton celebrated her man, David Adefeso’s 50th birthday, this weekend. She made sure to share an emotional message on her social media account, just to mark this important event.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not too many times that you meet someone and your world shakes. That happened to me when we locked eyes at Gene’s birthday party almost two years ago. You were a young man then, 😂 and also then, I knew we we would grow old together. You are my BEST friend and I thank you for so many things. Mostly for loving my son just like he’s your own. I can’t wait to turn up at your very first birthday party🥰 happy 50th bday @david.adefeso you may be an old man but you are still fine, Rich, and ALL MINE🤣🤣😂😂’ Tamar captioned her post.</p>

      <p>Her fans could not be happier for her, and they made sure to tell her this in the comments.</p>
      <p>Someone said: ‘You deserve this blessing! There are some people who the world never shakes for…♥️’</p>
      <p>One other follower said: ‘There’s nothing like having your man be your best friend. It’s a beautiful thang💯’</p>
      <p>A fan posted: ‘Lol…I love it and love you, Tamar. I am so happy you found a good man❤️’ and someone else shared: ‘Happy birthday now quit stressing him out spoiled self😂😂’</p>
      <p>One other follower wrote this: ‘Happy Birthday, David. Thanks for making Tamar so happy!!! You two are 🔥’</p>
      <p>A follower told Tamar that they are happy for her and wrote: ‘So happy for you @tamarbraxton and happy birthday sir thank you for bringing joy and love back to her.’</p>
      <p>Someone else said: ‘You give me so much strength… I am so incredibly happy for all your blessings. I pray for you always.’</p>
      <p>Tamar received a bit of shade these days, after she <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/tamar-braxton-has-a-word-for-vegans-check-out-her-message-which-triggered-a-new-controversy-343118/">had a few comments on vegans</a> that she decided to post on her social media account.</p>
      <p>She has also recently been bashed following some comments that she made about gays.</p>
