      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a> creator Chuck Lorre used the latest episode of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/young-sheldon/">Young Sheldon</a> to take a shot at President <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>The showrunner is known for the vanity cards – a card that allows him to say anything he wants – that pop up for one second at the end of each episode</p>
      <p>In Thursday’s installment he quoted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/10/18/hamilton-pushed-impeachment-powers-trump-is-what-he-had-mind/?arc404=true">a Washington Post piece that criticises the president</a>.</p>
      <p>Written by Ron Chernow, he quotes Alexander Hamilton when discussing why he should be removed from office.</p>
      <p>The vanity card quote describes ‘a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper…despotic in his ordinary demeanour…’</p>
      <p>At the end of the quote Lorre included ‘special thanks’ to Chernow.</p>
      <p>The full quote attributed to Hamilton reads: ‘When a man unprincipled in private life[,] desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper . . . despotic in his ordinary demeanour — known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty — when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity — to join in the cry of danger to liberty — to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government &amp; bringing it under suspicion — to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day — It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.”‘</p>

      <p>Previously the Young Sheldon boss used a vanity card to<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/big-bang-theory-creator-chuck-lorre-jokes-russia-help-young-sheldons-falling-ratings-11184182/"> joke that Russia should help with the comedy’s falling ratings.</a></p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Earlier this month the card read: ‘Russia, if you’re reading this, hack into the Nielsen computers and make our ratings higher.’</p>
      <p>The series focuses on the growing pains and family life of a young Sheldon Cooper, played by Jim Parsons in The Big Bang Theory. The series is narrated by Parsons.</p>
