      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – No deal has been reached, and that means another day of delays and cancellations because of the Metro Vancouver transit strike.</p>
      <p>10 SeaBus sailings have been axed for Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Lonsdale Quay sailings will be departing every 30 minutes compared to the regular 15 minutes as of 6:30 p.m. to around 9:00 p.m, and Waterfront sailings will be departing every 30 minutes as well from about 6:45 p.m to 9:00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Translink is also warning it will likely take you longer to catch a bus, although those delays are nothing compared to what’s planned for later this week, when bus drivers have threatened to shut down bus service for three straight days beginning on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Bus drivers and their employer have not been bargaining this weekend, and while SkyTrain workers have, they haven’t been able to reach a deal.</p>
