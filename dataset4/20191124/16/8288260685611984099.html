      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | Blues had to settle for a point in their Sky Bet Championship clash against the Terriers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:37:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Huddersfield Town fans have been giving their verdict on the 1-1 draw with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Blues came from a goal behind to earn a point at the John Smith’s Stadium in their first game back after the November international break.</p>
      <p>Fraizer Campbell opened the scoring for the Terriers before Marc Roberts equalised for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> with just over 10 minutes left to play.</p>
      <p>Blues now lie in 15th place in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/pep-clotet-press-conference-every-17306823">Championship table</a> going into Wednesday night’s trip to face Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.</p>
      <p>Here is what Huddersfield supporters had to say after the final whistle at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p><b>Daniel Peckett:</b> “Lack of leaders on the pitch going forward once Campbell and Pritchard were subbed. O’Brien was a natural at left back!”</p>
      <p><b>Mike Shackleton:</b> “Good performance, should have won, but that’s football!”</p>
      <p><b>Heather Whitehead:</b> “Saw some beautiful football being played by the terriers, Hoggy, O'Brien and Pritchard were class. Hoggy is a machine.”</p>
