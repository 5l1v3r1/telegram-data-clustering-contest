      <h1>Conor McGregor news: The Notorious' fight return in doubt as UFC release schedule</h1>
      <h2>The former two-weight champion had claimed he would fight on January 18 in Las Vegas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:27:31+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor's return to the UFC looks to have been put on hold after the promotion released its early schedule for 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">The former two-weight champion</a> had claimed he would fight on January 18 in Las Vegas with Donald Cerrone his likely opponent.</p>
      <p>McGregor's manager last week insisted a deal was close that would see the Dubliner fight for the first time since last October.</p>
      <p>But in the UFC's schedule of events, the first pay-per-view event of 2020, UFC 246, will take place on February 9 at the Honda Center in Houston.</p>
      <p>Light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones is expected to headline the event when he defends his title against Dominic Reyes.</p>

      <p>With McGregor only likely to fight in either Las Vegas or New York, the former champion looks set to be sidelined until March.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner has been shrouded in controversy recently having appeared in court charged with assaulting a man in a pub.</p>
      <p>He was fined just €1,000 and appeared ready to make his long-awaited return to the cage.</p>
      <p>His manager Audie Attar, speaking on ESPN, recently said: “I would say that talks have been progressing.</p>
      <p>"We’ve met them, we’re in close communication with them. I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress."</p>
      <p>Of course, if a deal is struck, UFC 246 could be switched to Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena in January with the Houston event becoming UFC 247.</p>
      <p>Or the company could break from tradition and give McGregor's return a new moniker to mark the occasion.</p>
      <p>The former featherweight and lightweight ruler has been out of action since he was choked out by 155lb king Khabib Nurmagomedov last year.</p>
      <p>UFC chief White said last month that he eager to see ‘The Notorious’ take on ‘Cowboy’ Cerrone, he admits an agreement has yet to be reached.</p>
      <p>“We have nothing done,” he told <i>TMZ</i> . “Nothing is even close to being done, so I hate to even talk about this stuff and say it because it might not happen.</p>
      <p>“It might happen, but we’re looking at Cowboy.</p>
      <p>“No3 vs No5, January 18 at the T-Mobile [Arena] in Las Vegas.</p>
