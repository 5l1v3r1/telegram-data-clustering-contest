        <b>An assistant minister who worked for former President Daniel Moi on Friday, November 22, passed on while receiving treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A report carried by <i>Daily Nation</i> indicated that former Galole Member of Parliament Tola Kofa died after spending a week at the hospital's private wing.</p>
      <p>Galole's son Patrick Mgawa disclosed that he passed on aged 75 after an illness.</p>
      <p>Tofa served as a member of the National Assembly for 15 years and as the assistant minister for water between 1998 and 2002 and Moi's regime.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the former lawmaker shocked constituency fund officials in Hola when he turned up among students who were seeking bursary funds. He claimed that he had not finished his masters.</p>
      <p>At the time, he explained that he needed the money urgently in order to settle fee balanced he owed the University of Nairobi's Political and Social Sciences faculty.</p>
      <p>When the officials wondered why he was seeking the finances yet he owned a fleet of public service vehicles, the former lawmaker explained that there was a political reason behind it and that he was not at liberty to reveal it.</p>
      <p>In 2003, the former minister was also at loggerheads with the police after they found a water pump in his home.</p>
      <p>They raided his house at the time and went away with the pump valued at Ksh700,000 at the time which they claimed was stolen from the Ministry of Water Development.</p>
      <p>Tana River police chief Danson Mutun, at the time, explained that the pump was given to the former leader to take to Hola constituency but he instead took it to his home.</p>
