        <b>The Internet’s love for crazy dash cam videos from Russia might somewhat exaggerate the situation on the roads, but sometimes the weather really is very harsh.

      <p>A T-80 tank has helped an unfortunate bus drove off the road in the Russia’s Amur Region, head of the Eastern Military District’s press service Col. Alexander Gordeev said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to the official statement, the bus was trapped in a ditch, blocking the way to a nearby settlement, but even a powerful truck could not rescue it due to the extremely slippery road. As a result, a nearby military academy sent a T-80 and a special tow truck and they managed to resolve the issue swiftly.</p>
