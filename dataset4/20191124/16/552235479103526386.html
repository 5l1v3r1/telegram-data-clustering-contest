      <h1>Rangers fans salute Brendan Rodgers and urge Celtic diehard Rod Stewart to change up his act - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Fraser Wilson mans the phones as Premiership football returns with a blast.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:15:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard kept <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> title challenge on course as the Ibrox side saw off Hamilton in Sunday’s lunchtime encounter.</p>
      <p>But according to one Hotline caller the Light Blues have another manager to thank for the crucial three points - <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Brendan Rodgers</a> .</p>
      <p><b>John Bruce</b> reckons the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss’ decision to send a strong Leicester side north to play the Gers in a friendly during the international break had a part to play in the victory.</p>
      <p>Yes it wouldn’t be the first Hotline of the week without a huge slice of banter and gamesmanship in the Old Firm title battle.</p>
      <p>John emailed: “It was very accommodating of Brendan Rodgers to bring a strong Leicester team up to Glasgow last week to play Rangers in a closed doors friendly - which Rangers won 3-0 - in order to keep some first team players' fitness levels up and to give some fringe players much needed game time.</p>

      <p>“That friendly may have been of benefit to Rangers in their victory over Hamilton on Sunday and, who knows, the away win could even have a bearing on the points total or goal difference at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>“Who would have thought that Rangers fans could be thanking Brendan Rodgers for a favour?”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Alasdair Robertson from Edinburgh is confident Gerrard’s men can go all the way and lift a first title in nine years. He said: “Rangers are showing a real ability to grind out results this year.</p>

      <p>"Last year they would have wilted under the pressure. This time they have the class to make the difference.</p>
      <p>"Ryan Kent has the most skillful feet in Scotland will be Player of the Year before his contract is up!"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Scott Brown for Scotland saga rumbles on. The Celtic skipper has opened the door to another international comeback but Hotline callers reckon it should be instantly slammed shut by Steve Clarke.</p>
      <p>Brown, who has 55 caps, first retired from Scotland duty in 2016 but answered an SOS from ex-boss Gordon Strachan two months later only to call it quits again when Alex McLeish took charge in February 2018.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has never played at a major tournament for Scotland though and callers insist it should stay that way should we qualify for next summer’s Euros.</p>
      <p><b>John Davidson</b> from Armadale said: “Scott Brown has no right to pick and choose, his time as a Scottish international has gone, the younger generation are starting to flourish and the future looks bright. He would be better focusing on playing for the Scottish veterans in the soccer sixes.”</p>
      <p><b>David Knox, Queens Park,</b> blasted: “I can’t believe the audacity of Scott Brown regarding the euros. He must be one of the most overrated players ever and only has medals due to Rangers being wrongfully demoted. Brown would be shown up in the Euros - just like in every Champions League game he has played in.”</p>
      <p><b>Mike Atherton, Craigentinny,</b> said: “Broony wanting to play for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> again IF we make the Euro's doesn't sit easy with me. I realise he wants to play in an international tournament but he's only doing it for himself.</p>

      <p>“He would be taking the place of someone that's turned up time and again and that’s just not fair to me. He's packed in playing in dark blue twice to prolong his club career so Steve Clarke should stick with the guys that have got us this far. We don't have too bad a midfield anyway so its a no from me. Good luck to Scotland whoever we play.”</p>
      <p><b>John Corson</b> was to the point, emailing: “Scott Brown retuning to the Scotland camp.... you’re having a laugh.”</p>
      <p>While <b>Ian Loudon, Dunfermline,</b> said: “If I was Scotland manager I would tell Brown to do one in giant steps. This guy has decided twice he is retiring from international football. Does he think he is bigger than any management team?”</p>
      <p>Sticking with Scotland’s midfield and <b>Gordon Ashley, Ayr,</b> doesn’t agree with Rangers boss Steven Gerrard’s assertion that Ryan Jack is a match for anyone in Steve Clarke’s engine room.</p>

      <p>He said: “What a fool Gerrard is saying Scotland’s recent wins are down to Ryan Jack playing. Nothing to do with the fact the other games were against Belgium and Russia then? Jack is a decent player but nowhere near the level of Scott McTominay and Callum McGregor who will start against Israel for certain.”</p>
      <p>On to domestic matters and <b>Stephen Mulhern, Dumbarton,</b> reckons the young player of the season award is already wrapped up.</p>
      <p>He said: “After witnessing yet another masterclass performance from Celtic wonder kid Jeremie Frimpong even this early it’s time to close the voting on the young player of the year award. Frimpong is having the same impact as when Emilio Izaguirre burst on the scene.</p>
      <p>Celtic romped to a 4-0 win over Livingston on Saturday but Hoops fan <b>Stevie Delaney</b> wasn’t entirely happy. He emailed: “Lenny needs to stop shoehorning Jonny Hayes into the side and although a half decent winger who gives his all, he’s never a left back in front of Greg Taylor.”</p>
      <p>Finally Rod Stewart fan <b>James Forsyth</b> from Bellshill had a message for the Hotline’s biggest fan ahead of his gig in Glasgow on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He said: “I saw Sir Rod feels loved only by half the city. But maybe Rangers fans love his music and stay away. I know he reads this so maybe cut out all the Celtic stuff on stage and make other fans feel welcome. I will be there on Thursday as a Rangers and a music fan - we could discuss it then.”</p>
