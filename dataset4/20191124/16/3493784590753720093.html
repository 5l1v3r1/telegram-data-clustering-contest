        <h3>DRIVING THE DAY</h3>
        <p><b>OF ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS </b>in the <b>TRUMP</b> era, this one is up there.</p>
        <p><b>FIRST,</b> here’s your primer, via <b>MAGGIE HABERMAN, HELENE COOPER</b> and <b>DAVE PHILLIPS </b>on A1 of the NYT today: “The secretary of the Navy and the admiral who leads the SEALs have threatened to resign or be fired if plans to expel a commando from the elite unit in a war crimes case are halted by President Trump, administration officials said Saturday.</p>
        <p><b>“The high-level pushback to Mr. Trump’s unambiguous assertion</b> on Twitter this past week that the commando, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, should remain in the unit was an extraordinary development in what was already an extraordinary case, one with few precedents in the history of presidential relations with the American military.</p>
        <p><b>“The Navy secretary, Richard V. Spencer, later denied</b> that he had threatened to resign but said disciplinary plans against Chief Gallagher would proceed because he did not consider Mr. Trump’s statement on Twitter to be a formal order. Mr. Spencer added that the president, as commander in chief, had the authority to intervene and that it would stop ‘the process.’” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/politics/navy-discipline-edward-gallagher.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><u>NYT</u></a></p>
        <p><b>THEN, THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT</b> tweeted this: “Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher will be on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:30 A.M. Have no fear, all will end well for everyone!”</p>
        <p><b>GALLAGHER</b> used that appearance to accuse the secretary of the Navy of “meddling” in his case, which he threatened to expose next week.</p>
        <p><b>WSJ: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-allow-internal-review-of-navy-seal-case-11574599532?mod=hp_lead_pos6">“Trump to Allow Internal Review of Navy SEAL Case,”</a> </b>by Gordon Lubold and Nancy Youssef: “Mr. Trump is allowing the Navy to convene a peer-review board to determine whether Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher will remain in the elite unit, military officials said. The Navy got word late Friday, officials said, that Mr. Trump would allow it to continue to adjudicate the matter. The board will be the Navy’s final say on the fate of Chief Gallagher, who was cleared of more serious war crimes that took place in Iraq but found guilty of dishonoring his service by posing for a picture with a dead militant.”</p>
        <p><b>NEW YORK GOP REP. LEE ZELDIN</b> -- a combat vet -- to <b>JAKE TAPPER</b> on <b>CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: </b>“The -- the president of the United States is the commander in chief. It is not easy to earn that trident to become a Navy SEAL or an Army Ranger or Green Beret, a Marine, and so on so forth. A lot of people have taken -- it's great pain, great sacrifice to be able to gain that type of experience, that combat experience, as well as those training badges.</p>
        <p>“And for President Trump, or whether it's a past president or a future president, as the commander in chief, it is their prerogative, if they want to defend somebody like -- like this, who has really gone through a lot to earn those types of awards, if he or she wants to weigh in as commander in chief, that is their prerogative.”</p>
        <p><b>SNEAK PEEK … THE PRESIDENT’S WEEK … Monday: PRESIDENT TRUMP</b> will have lunch with the vice president, and meet with the prime minister of Bulgaria. <b>Tuesday: THE PRESIDENT</b> will have lunch with the secretary of State, and participate in the presentation of the national Thanksgiving Turkey. He will go to Sunrise, Fla., for a political rally.</p>
        <p><b>THE PRESIDENT</b> will be in Palm Beach for the Thanksgiving holiday, and will participate in a teleconference on Thursday with members of the military.</p>
        <p><b>MIKE BLOOMBERG</b> has announced he’s getting in the presidential race. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/1198620233994526722"><i>Announcement video</i></a></b></p>
        <p><b>-- NYT’S ALEX BURNS: </b>“At 77, Mr. Bloomberg is one of the oldest candidates in the race, and like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders he would become the oldest person ever to assume the presidency if elected. Mr. Bloomberg is also, with Mr. Sanders, one of two major candidates for the nomination who are Jewish, and either would be the first Jewish president if elected.</p>
        <p><b>“Should Mr. Bloomberg become the Democratic nominee,</b> it would set up a general election between two party-switching moguls from New York City, though Mr. Bloomberg’s fortune is larger than Mr. Trump’s many times over.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020-presidency.html"><u>NYT</u></a></p>

        <p><b>PETER BAKER</b> ties it together on A1, with this News Analysis: <b>“A Split Decision From Congress Will Leave Voters With Final Say on Trump”:</b> “Every one is playing their assigned role in a drama where the ending seems known in advance as the House of Representatives heads toward a likely party-line vote to impeach the president, followed by a Senate trial that will not convict him.</p>
        <p><b>“But if the outcome of the showdown on Capitol Hill at the moment </b>appears foreordained, the ultimate verdict still is not. Unlike Presidents Richard M. Nixon or Bill Clinton, Mr. Trump faces an election after his impeachment battle, meaning that the voters will serve as the court of appeals rendering their own final judgment on whether he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/politics/trump-impeachment-voters.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><u>NYT</u></a></p>

        <p><b>FOX NEWS’ MARIA BARTIROMO</b> asked<b> REP.

        <p><b>-- NUNES:</b> “I really want to answer all of these questions and I promise you I absolutely will come back on the show and answer these questions. But because there is criminal activity here, we’re working with the appropriate law enforcement agencies, we are going to file all this -- everyone’s going to know the truth, everybody is going to know all the facts but I think you can understand that I can’t compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt. And because this is criminal in nature and because it is so bad, so slanderous, we’ve got all the facts on our side and we are going to file in federal court because I'm not going to sit here and try to compete against the media that I have no chance of winning this. I will win in court and they’ll have a chance to cooperate and they’ll have to show how they work with somebody who has been indicted which is likely conspiring to obstruct justice.”</p>

          <b>SUNDAY BEST …</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>-- JAKE TAPPER </b>asked<b> HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF</b> (D-Calif.) about waiting for more testimony from people like<b> MICK MULVANEY </b>on <b>CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”</b>: “Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in. But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out, to stall this proceeding when the facts are already overwhelming. … We do need to consider that if we allow this obstruction to succeed -- we allow them to draw us out endlessly in the courts -- then it does make the impeachment clause a non entity. It means Congress will forever be incapable of doing any oversight. Why should any future president answer a congressional subpoena?”</p>
        <p><b>-- CHUCK TODD</b> asked <b>SCHIFF</b> about having the whistleblower testify on <b>NBC’S “MEET THE PRESS”</b>: “We had a deep interest in having the whistleblower testify until two things happened. One, we were able to prove everything in the whistleblower complaint with witnesses that had firsthand information, and second, the president and his allies effectively put that whistleblower's life in danger. The president said the whistleblower and others should be treated as a traitor or a spy and we ought to use the penalty we used to use for traitors and spies, and that's the death penalty. So, here's the thing, Chuck, we don't need the whistleblower's secondhand evidence anymore. It would only serve to endanger this person and to gratify the president's desire for retribution, and that is not a good enough reason to bring in the whistleblower.”</p>
        <p><b>-- REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CALIF.)</b> to <b>CHRIS WALLACE </b>on <b>“FOX NEWS SUNDAY” </b>about the “urgency” of the impeachment probe<b>: </b>“Most importantly the president invoked an upcoming election. And voters, you know, in just a few months are going to be voting in the upcoming caucuses. And so there’s an urgency to make sure the election and the ballot box, you know, have integrity. And if he’s asking a foreign government to interfere in an election, you know, we are, you know, on the clock to make sure that that election is protected.”</p>
