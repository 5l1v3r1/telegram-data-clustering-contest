      <p>Mullinahone (Tipperary) 2-10 - 1-10 Croom (Limerick)</p>
      <p>Midfielder Alan Curran was the toast of Mullinahone with a goal deep in injury-time to give his side victory over Croom in a nail-biting finish to a thrilling Munster Club JFC semi-final at Bansha.</p>
      <p>The contest looked to be heading for extra-time when Curran popped up on the edge of the Croom square to fist Kevin Walzer’s free from distance to the net.</p>
      <p>It was a late sucker-punch that caught Croom but Mullinahone, despite a poor start, were the better side and had they taken their chances would never have required such a dramatic finale.</p>
      <p>Though the Tipp lads had the opening score, it was Croom who did best near goal in the first half and they were leading 0-8 to 0-2 approaching half-time thanks to some neat points from Jamie Graves (3) and Mickey Cahill (2). Mullinahaone finished with points from Eanna Ryan and Kevin Walzer but the Limerick champions were 0-8 to 0-4 at the break.</p>
      <p>Mullinahone started the second half in a blaze and Eanna Ryan had a goal and two pointed free, and Sean Curran a point, as they surged 1-7 to 0-8 ahead inside five minutes. It took Croom some time to steady the ship but Mark Reidy’s goal after 47 minutes had them 1-8 to 1-7 in front. As the game moved into injury time the sides were level 1-10 each, but in the 62nd minute, Curran applied the finishing touch to Kevin Walzer’s free to clinch victory for the Tipp lads.</p>
      <p>While Curran was Mullinahone’s hero, Martin Kehoe was their top performer ably abetted by Jack Shelly, Kevin Walzer, Sean Curran, and Daire O'Brien.</p>
      <p>For Croom, Mark Reidy was a big threat early on with Eoin Cregan, Mickey Cahill, Jamie Graves, and John Quirke also prominent.</p>
