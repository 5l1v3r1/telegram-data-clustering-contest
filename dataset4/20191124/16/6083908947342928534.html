      <h1>Bloomberg Officially Launches His Campaign for President</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:46:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bethbaumann" target="_blank">Beth Baumann</a></address>
      <p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Sunday officially launched his presidential campaign. He shared a video on social media, announcing his intent to "defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America."</p>
      <p>His campaign video paints him as a self-made billionaire who used his wealth to help others and create "good paying jobs." His team also touted his efforts to "take on the NRA" by creating Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action.</p>

      <p>Back in March, Bloomberg said he had no intention of running for president. The fact that he's throwing his hat in the ring shows he's not confident in the current crop of candidates.</p>
      <p>But his official announcement comes as no surprise. Over the last few weeks, his team has been focusing on getting his name on the ballot in Super Tuesday states.</p>
      <p>The billionaire plans to skip the Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire Primary and, instead, focus on the cluster of Super Tuesday states that vote early in the year.</p>
      <p>“If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,” advisor Howard Wolfson previously told the <a href="https://apnews.com/653386c5e7e040d09836d0e013558815">Associated Press</a>. </p>
      <p>Super Tuesday is set to take place on March 3, 2020 and includes: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Democrats Abroad, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.</p>
