      <h1>ESPN Releases Prediction For Ohio State-Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:26:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan face off next weekend in the latest edition of one of the fiercest rivalries in all of sports. The Wolverines will be looking to avenge last year’s blowout loss against a Buckeyes team eyeing a spot in the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes clinched a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game yesterday thanks to a fairly convincing win over Penn State. Despite the offense being held to a season-low 28 points – not bad – the outcome was rarely in doubt. It remains to be seen if that performance earns them the top spot in the CFB Playoff polls, but yesterday made a very good case.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines have been proving all of the doubters wrong since their October loss to Penn State. Michigan was on upset alert in the first half against Indiana yesterday. But they mowed down the Hoosiers in the second half for their fourth win in a row.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401112228">ESPN’s computer model</a> has released its prediction for the Ohio State-Michigan game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model believes that Ohio State has a big advantage in this one. The computer model gives the Buckeyes a 73.9 percent chance to win this Saturday’s game.</h3>
      <p>Ohio State is currently riding a seven-game winning streak against Michigan. But this will be Ryan Day’s first time running all of the preparations for the game. Last year, his offense scored a record 62 points on the Wolverines.</p>
      <p>Will history repeat itself this year?</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 12 p.m. EST on FOX.</p>
