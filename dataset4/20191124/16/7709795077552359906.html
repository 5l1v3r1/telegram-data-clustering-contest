        <b>Photographer Pat Healy was taken to hospital following a nasty incident after the line in the opening race at Navan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thatsy and Entoucas fought out a thrilling finish to the www.navanracecourse.ie Maiden Hurdle, with the pair coming close together on the run to the line after negotiating the final hurdle.</p>
      <p>While Thatsy just edged in front to win, Entoucas appeared to crash through the inside railing just after the post - colliding with the photographer, who was stationed nearby.</p>
      <p>He was quickly tended to by medical staff - and while he was reported to be conscious, he was taken to Blanchardstown Hospital by ambulance for further examination, causing a delay to the following 'Monksfield' Novice Hurdle.</p>
      <p>The doctor on duty at the track, Frank Kenny, said: "He left the course very stable and has injuries to the right side of his chest."</p>
      <p>Entoucas and rider Mark Walsh escaped serious injury, with the jockey reporting his mount had dived at the gap in the railing just after the line.</p>
      <p>The stewards held an inquiry to examine the incident and have referred the matter for further assessment.</p>
      <p>Their report stated: "Having viewed the recording of the race and considered the evidence, the stewards were satisfied that there was no breach of raceday rules and that both riders were blameless.</p>
      <p>"However, due to the gravity of the incident, the stewards referred the matter to the CEO of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board for further investigation."</p>
