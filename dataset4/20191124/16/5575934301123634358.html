        <li>Josh Trank, the director of the 2015 “Fantastic Four” movie that flopped at the box office and was critically panned, reviewed the movie on Friday on the film-centric social platform Letterboxd.</li>
        <li>Trank called the movie “alright” and wrote that he thought it would be “much worse than it was.”</li>
        <li>He alluded to some production woes, saying that there are “two different movies in one movie.”</li>
        <li>The Hollywood Reporter said in 2015 that Trank was “erratic” on the set of the movie, which Trank pushed back on at the time.</li>
        <li>Trank wrote in his review that he was in “a situation more complicated than anything a 2nd time filmmaker should have walked into” but he doesn’t regret any of it.</li>

      <p>2015’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/disney-revamp-of-fantastic-four-in-marvel-cinematic-universe-analysis-2019-3">“Fantastic Four”</a> is considered a huge misfire critically and financially. The Fox movie received a 9% Rotten Tomatoes critic score and flopped at the box office with just $US56 million domestically and $US167 million worldwide off of a $US120 million production budget.</p>
      <p>The movie’s director, Josh Trank, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/">opened up about the movie in a review</a> on the film-centric social platform Letterboxd on Friday, saying it was “alright.”</p>
      <p>“I was expecting it to be much worse than it was,” Trank wrote. “I literally haven’t seen it since like two weeks before it came out, and I was in a heavily fucking traumatized state of mind. Why? Eh, save that for another time.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “Everyone in the film is a great actor, and overall there is a movie in there, somewhere. And that cast deserves to be in THAT movie. Everyone who worked on Fant4stic clearly wanted to be making THAT movie. But…. ultimately… It wasn’t. Did I make that movie they deserved to be in? To be honest? I can’t tell.”</p>
      <p>Some behind-the-scenes turmoil, such as <a href="https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/01/15/fantastic-four-is-going-in-for-reshoots">reshoots to add more action</a> to the movie, was widely reported at the time of the movie’s release. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/inside-a-star-wars-firing-792933">The Hollywood Reporter</a> reported in May 2015 (three months before its release date) that Trank was forced out of a “Star Wars” movie, which has since been scrapped, because Lucasfilm was reportedly alarmed by his behaviour on the “Fantastic Four” set.</p>
      <p>An anonymous source told THR that Trank was “erratic” and “very isolated” during production on the movie. Trank, meanwhile, said he exited the “Star Wars” movie for personal reasons. He told <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-josh-trank-on-why-he-dropped-out-of-star-wars-20150603-story.html#page=1">The Los Angeles Times</a> in June 2015 that it was ” the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make in my life” and pushed back on THR’s report.</p>
      <p>“None of those facts were true, and any of the facts that were true were spun in such a maliciously wrong way,” he told the Times.</p>
      <p>Trank alluded to the difficult production in his Letterboxd review, saying that there are “two different movies in one movie competing to be that movie.”</p>
      <p>“I was 29 years old, making my 2nd film, in a situation more complicated than anything a 2nd time filmmaker should have walked into,” Trank wrote. “That said… I don’t regret any of it. It’s a part of me.”</p>
      <p>The Fantastic Four film rights now belong with Disney after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-fox-merger-top-execs-peter-rice-dana-walden-alan-horn-2019-1">the company acquired Fox’s film studio</a> earlier this year, meaning the characters could potentially appear in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-some-marvel-cinematic-universe-movies-arent-on-disney-plus-2019-11">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> in the future. No plans for that have been announced yet, though.</p>
      <p>If Disney does make another “Fantastic Four” movie, Trank is hoping that “Ant-Man” director Peyton Reed directs it.</p>
      <p>“I just hope Peyton Reed makes the next Fantastic Four and crushes it,” he wrote. “And that I get a cameo.”</p>
