      <p>"At around 6:20pm [13:50 GMT] a grenade was hurled at a UN vehicle," interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.</p>
      <p>Five other people - including two Afghan staff - were wounded in the attack, Rahimi said. The nationalities of the other victims were not released.</p>
      <p>The blast targeted the vehicle on one of the busiest roads in the city, in police district 9, according to Rahimi.</p>
      <p>No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>The explosion comes during what has been a period of relative and uneasy calm in Kabul, where large-scale attacks have dropped in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The lull followed a blood-stained presidential campaign season that ended with a general election nearly two months ago.</p>
      <p>But Afghans are still waiting for the results of the September 28 polls, with a recount bogged down by various technical difficulties and complaints from the main candidates.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in central Daykundi province, at least eight soldiers were killed when <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/taliban.html">Taliban</a> fighters stormed their checkpoint, provincial Governor Anwar Rahmati said.</p>
      <p>Four other troops were wounded in the hours-long gun battle, he said.</p>
      <p>Rahmati said reinforcements were dispatched early on Sunday to the area in Kajran district, driving off the fighters while killing at least 20 attackers.</p>
      <p>Qari Yusouf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for the checkpoint attack. He disputed the Taliban casualty figures provided by the governor and said the fighters seized weapons and ammunition.</p>
      <p>Afghans are waiting to see what might happen next in negotiations between the Taliban and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-States.html">United States</a>.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> in September ended those year-long talks as Taliban violence continued, but on Friday he suggested to US broadcaster Fox News that negotiations could be getting under way again.</p>
