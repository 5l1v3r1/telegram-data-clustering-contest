      <h1>Towns devastated by flood to be deluged again as Met Office issues weather warnings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:55:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/j/jack-hardy/" target="_blank">Jack Hardy</a></address>
      <p>Flood-stricken towns in South Yorkshire will face a fresh deluge this week, as forecasters warned heavy rain meant households should take “precautions”.</p>
      <p>A major evacuation effort was launched in the village of Fishlake earlier this month a<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/08/severe-flooding-hits-yorkshire-pictures/">fter the River Don burst its banks </a>and flooded much of the surrounding area. </p>
      <p>The Army was drafted in to help rescue people from more than 1,000 homes, leaving many residents homeless for days.</p>
      <p>Now there could be further trouble in store for the Doncaster region as a yellow rain warning was issued by the Met Office for Wednesday, covering most of Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Flood warnings have not yet been put in place for Fishlake and nearby towns and villages, with the forecaster saying it was too early to judge how damaging the weather could be. </p>
      <p>Sophie Yeomans, from the Met Office, said the heavy rain could “potentially” heap further misery on flood-hit communities.</p>

      <p>She said: “There is still a bit of uncertainty with this weather system, there will be some rain through Monday and Tuesday which could be reasonable but running into Wednesday it is going to be a bit heavier.”</p>
      <p>The risk of flooding will depend on how water-saturated the ground has become during the rain at the start of the week, the forecaster said. </p>
      <p>She added: “As things stand at the moment we are expecting some rain to come through so it is a heads-up that if you’re in those sort of areas then, if there are precautions you can take, that would be a good thing.</p>
      <p>“We are expecting more rainfall to come through so keep up to date with what we are saying.”</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/11/13/environment-agency-cannot-escape-blame-role-flooding/"> faced criticism for allegedly telling residents</a> in Fishlake they would not need sandbags shortly before the village was submerged.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, a spokesman for the agency said no additional plans had been put in place for the area ahead of this week’s rain storms. </p>
      <p>He said: “We are expecting water levels to rise, but we are not expecting them to rise to the level where any special measures are needed.”</p>
      <p>Efforts to prevent future floods have been ongoing in South Yorkshire since the recent problems and water levels in the River Don dropped last week.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency said it will “continue to monitor the situation” as the week progresses.</p>
