      <p>The best <a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday deals for Apple products aren’t usually found at the company’s stores but at several other retailers. Apple is offering up an Apple Store Gift Card worth <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;referrer=theverge.com"><i>up to</i> $200</a> on select products during its four-day shopping event. Meanwhile, Best Buy, Target, Amazon, B&amp;H Photo, and Walmart are also hosting some noteworthy deals on Apple products.</p>
      <p>We’re seeing the best-ever pricing on the new seventh-generation iPad, the Apple Watch Series 3 and Series 4 smartwatches, AirPods, and Apple’s new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. If you missed out on getting a good deal on the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro, you’ll have another chance. More deals are on the way, and we’ll be tracking them all below.</p>
      <h3>AirPods</h3>
      <p>The latest iteration of the AirPods, both with and without the wireless charging case, are discounted at several retailers for Black Friday. At their most affordable, you can usually expect to pay $159.99, but <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case-latest-model-white%2F6084400.p%3FskuId%3D6084400&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574604048320fig">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574604048320eeb">Walmart</a> each sell them for $139.99 right now.</p>
      <p>If you want to be able to pop them onto your wireless charger, the model that includes a case that supports your wire-free lifestyle is usually $199.99, but it costs $164.99 right now at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case-latest-model-white%2F6083595.p%3FskuId%3D6083595&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574604048320dde">Best Buy</a>. It’s just a little more at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;xcust=xid:fr1574604048320had">Target</a> at $169.99.</p>
      <p>So far, there aren’t any deals on the Apple AirPods Pro, but we’re keeping a close eye on all retailers and will update this page if that changes.</p>

      <h3>iPad</h3>
      <p>We’re seeing the biggest deals so far on the seventh-generation iPad, which is great because it recently released. As for why you should pick the new iPad over the sixth-generation model, it comes down to a little extra RAM, a bigger screen (10.2 inches versus 9.7 inches), and a Smart Connector port. Otherwise, you’ll find the same processor inside.</p>
      <p>The seventh-gen iPad with 32GB of storage costs $249.99 right now at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-ipad-7th-generation-10-2-tablet-32gb-wifi-space-gray-mw742ll-a%2Fproduct_24419814%3Ftid%3DUS%26storeId%3D10001%253FstoreId%253D10001%26identifier%3DSH76%26catalogIdentifier%3DSH76%26AID%3D10463300%26PID%3D6156980%26SID%3Dk3dawqfxr600xjf5009bn%26cvosrc%3Daffiliate.cj.6156980%26cvo_campaign%3DSubaffiliate%26cm_mmc%3DCJ-_-6156980-_-6156980-_-10463300%26CID%3DAFF%253A6156980%253A6156980%253A10463300%26CJPIXEL%3DCJPIXEL%26cjevent%3D54af1ce30ee311ea81ce03400a24060e&amp;referrer=theverge.com">Staples</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2KMSaIg">Amazon</a>. It’s $279.99 (usually $329.99) at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-32gb-space-gray%2F5985609.p%3FskuId%3D5985609">Best Buy</a>. It will go down to $249.99 at Target on Black Friday. If you want more storage, the 128GB model is <s>$379.99</s> $329.99 (usually $429.99) at <a href="https://amzn.to/35xoMgW">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-128gb-gold%2F5985616.p%3FskuId%3D5985616">Best Buy</a>. (You’ll need to sign up for the free My Best Buy program to get the deal there.)</p>
      <h3>iPhone</h3>
      <p>We aren’t seeing deals on the unlocked iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max. However, several retailers will be discounting them via activation with carriers.</p>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, if you’re looking for a discount on an iPhone 11 Pro, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fiphone%2Fshop-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max%2Fpcmcat1568147641595.c&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574607249343fha">you may be able to buy one for as little as $499 (roughly half off)</a>, but only if you activate a new line with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Sprint and also trade in your old phone. How much you pay overall will depend on how much trade-in value your phone has. After activating it and trading in your old phone, the final cost for the iPhone 11 after your installment plan is paid off <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fiphone-11%3Firclickid%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26acampID%3D614286&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574607249343hfj">will be $199</a>.</p>
      <p>Over at Target, the iPhone deals kick off on Black Friday and last through Sunday. You can get a $200 gift card when you activate either the <a href="https://fave.co/2Qn7m2e">iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max</a> with Verizon or AT&amp;T. Target will also offer a $200 gift card for the <a href="https://fave.co/2O8o2YF">iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max</a>, which cost less per month than the iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max.</p>
