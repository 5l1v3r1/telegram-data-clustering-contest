      <h1>US election 2020: Could former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick save the day for moderate Democrats?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:34:34+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">David Millward</a></address>
      <p>Deval Patrick's term as governor of Massachusetts did not get off to the best of starts in February 2007.</p>
      <p>With the state facing a $1 billion deficit and department heads told to trim budgets by 10 per cent, he chose to upgrade his official car from a Ford Crown Victoria to a Cadillac DeVille.</p>
      <p>This did not go down well and a few wags still call him "Cadillac Patrick".</p>
      <p>It is the sort of niggle which could come to haunt Mr Patrick, 62, as he enters the race for the Democratic nomination.</p>
      <p>But against that is his record as governor of Massachusetts, which impressed voters sufficiently to give him a second term.</p>
      <p>"He was a terrific governor of Massachusetts," said Setti Warren, the executive director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and former mayor of Newton, a town 10 miles west of Boston.</p>
      <p>"He took Massachusetts out of recession. He increased investment in education and transportation. He made the state a leader in renewable energy and created an environment which allowed life sciences to flourish."</p>
      <p>Mr Patrick's decision to enter the race, albeit belatedly, is evidence of the alarm among Democratic moderates that they will be swept away by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/27/could-elizabeth-warren-end-real-winner-trump-impeachment-inquiry/">the Elizabeth Warren juggernaut.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/01/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-attacked-rivals-torrid-night/">Joe Biden's faltering campaign</a> has triggered gossip that Hillary Clinton could throw her hat into the ring along with billionaire philanthropist and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/13/democrats-2020-could-michael-bloomberg-dethrone-donald-trump/">former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Patrick offers a compelling backstory. He was raised by a single mother on the crime-plagued South Side of Chicago. Through diligence and intelligence, he gained entry to both Harvard and Harvard Law School.</p>
      <p>As a lawyer, he served as US Assistant Attorney General in Bill Clinton's administration and also in the private sector – working for Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney.</p>
      <p>Given the party's leftward drift, his association with a company synonymous with the man who ran against Barack Obama in the 2012 election, will do him few favours.</p>
      <p>Doubts over his candidacy remain among Democrats like former Congressman Barney Frank.</p>
      <p>"He was a perfectly able and competent governor, but there was nothing extraordinary about him.</p>
      <p>"I have a problem with people like him and Mike Bloomberg saying they are coming in to save the Democratic party."</p>
      <p>Steve Jarding, a veteran Democrat strategist, believes he has entered the race too late.</p>
      <p>"Deval Patrick does not have a lot of time left. How many times will he get to New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina?</p>
      <p>"Time is your friend until it becomes your enemy. He has some smart people around him and he has been a successful governor and these smart people will tell him that this is too late."</p>
