      <p>While <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i> was an enormous success, it’s had its fair share of detractors -- and it seems that <i>Star Wars</i>’ creator was one of them. The film’s director, J.J. Abrams, addressed revelations that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/How-George-Lucas-Really-Feels-About-Star-Wars-Now-It-His-97187.html">George Lucas was disappointed</a> with his first chapter in the franchise. And his response was incredibly gracious.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483691/disneys-bob-iger-says-star-wars-movies-are-special-and-less-is-more">Disney CEO Bob Iger</a> released his memoir, <i>The Ride of a Lifetime</i>. He <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-bob-iger-says-george-lucas-felt-betrayed-by-star-wars-plans-1242953">provided some insight</a> into George Lucas’ reaction to <i>The Force Awakens.</i> He said the director had believed that the studio would use the story ideas he submitted after they purchased Lucasfilm. When he realized they were going in a different direction with the franchise, he was disappointed. George Lucas addressed this frustration after <i>The Force Awakens</i> hit theaters, and hinted that he was not entirely pleased with Disney.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/star-wars-jj-abrams-secrets-of-skywalker-912362/">Rolling Stone</a>, <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>' director, J.J. Abrams, shared his thoughts on the revelation -- and made it clear he had sympathy for his fellow filmmaker:</p>
      <blockquote>I’ve only had gratitude for George. It’s probably a complicated thing for him. To decide you’re going to sell this thing that you created, that was your baby, to anyone — that must be more complicated than signing a check and smiling about it. But he’s been incredibly gracious. He’s been super-generous.</blockquote>
      <p>Now in the midst of promoting <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>, J.J. Abrams shared how <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484803/yes-star-wars-george-lucas-talked-to-jj-abrams-about-midi-chlorians">his working relationship with George Lucas</a> has progressed. He also opened up about how he felt when he learned the director and producer wasn’t happy with <i>The Force Awakens</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>He came over, we had a meeting when we first started working on this [new movie], talked through a ton of different ideas and stories, and heard from him what was important. And we’ve done nothing but try and adhere to some fundamental aspects of the story. It wasn’t a difficult thing to try and do. And again, he was really gracious. So I’m only grateful. Do I wish that [<i>Force Awakens</i>] had been his favorite movie of all time? Yes, I only wanted to do well by him. I would just say that I have nothing but profound respect for the guy and am still truly, even more so now, working on these movies in awe of what he created.</blockquote>
      <p>While George Lucas felt <i>The Force Awakens</i> strayed too far from his vision, some fans criticized the film for being <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485446/is-the-new-star-wars-trilogy-too-much-like-the-original-jj-abrams-understands-criticisms">too similar</a> to the original trilogy. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485434/what-if-jj-abrams-directed-the-entire-star-wars-sequel-trilogy">J.J. Abrams</a> has responded both these perspectives with respect. And now, he’ll need to gear up for another round of fan response: anticipation for his <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker-68597.html">final chapter of the Skywalker saga</a> is extremely high -- and both fans <i>and</i> George Lucas will be watching.</p>
