        <i>Denis Hurley reports from Páirc Uí Rinn</i>
      </p>
      <p>A SUPERB PERFORMANCE from Brendan Maher characterised Borris-Ileigh’s indomitable spirit as they claimed a first AIB Munster club SHC title since 1986 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Waterford’s Ballygunner had the edge for much of the proceedings at Páirc Uí Rinn but Kieran Maher’s goal in the 44th minute tied the game at 1-7 to 0-10 and Maher’s fourth immediately afterwards put them ahead for the first time since early the game.</p>
      <p>A free from the Tipperary star opened up a two-point advantage but the momentum looked to have turned back the way of Ballygunner on 51 when the excellent Dessie Hutchinson found Barry O’Sullivan in space and he slotted home.</p>
      <p>Though Jerry Kelly levelled for Borris, Conor Sheahan put Ballygunner ahead again on 53 but it proved to be their final score. Maher tied the game again with a free as his scoring tally matched his jersey number of 6.</p>

      <p>Then, in the second-last minute of normal time, Conor Kenny found his brother Niall and though Stephen O’Keeffe saved his goal effort, he had been fouled and Maher sent over the winning score.</p>
      <p>While Maher and Dan McCormack performed well in the first half, Borris were second-best to Ballygunner, who had Philip Mahony on form in the half-back line, were smarter in their use of the ball. Mahony’s brother Pauric was a source of scores for them from frees while Hutchinson lit up the first half with a trio of fine points.</p>
      <p>The outscored Borris by 0-4 to 0-1 from the 19th minute until half-time and it was 0-9 to 0-6 at the break.</p>

      <p>After Maher got his third for Borris on 33, the Gunners might have got in for a goal as Hutchinson’s super pass set Peter Hogan away but he was fouled before he could shoot.</p>
      <p>Pauric Mahony pointed the free to leave three in it again, but Ray McCormack’s powerful run led to Kieran Maher’s goal and Borris pushed on from there.</p>
