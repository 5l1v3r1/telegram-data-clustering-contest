        <i>Police seek witnesses after three incidents in West Ealing and east London</i>
      </p>
      <p>Three men have been killed and at least four injured in separate stabbings in London this weekend.</p>
      <p>A 24-year-old man died in hospital at about midday on Sunday, six hours after police and paramedics found him suffering from stab injuries in Ilford Lane, east London.</p>
      <p>Police believe he sustained his injuries after a brawl broke out at a party hosted at a disused commercial premises in nearby Seven Kings.</p>
      <p>DI Michael Dougall said that a “large number of people” are believed to have been present at the party and is appealing for witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Officers were called to the reported fight, in Telegraph Mews, at 6.10am but found no injured people by the time they arrived.</p>
      <p>A second man, also believed to have been involved in the brawl, was being treated in hospital for stab injuries. The man, in his 20s, is not in a life-threatening condition and no arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the capital, a murder investigation was launched after a man was found with fatal stab wounds inside a car outside West Ealing station shortly after 1am on Sunday. The 26-year-old died at the scene despite the efforts of paramedics to treat his stab wound.</p>

      <p>The Met said the victim was believed to have been driving one of the cars involved and was injured before the crash took place.</p>
      <p>DCI Neil John said: “We believe the victim was involved in an altercation 100 metres from the railway station on The Avenue. This is a busy street with a number of shops and restaurants and if anybody was in the area and saw something, no matter how small, I would urge them to contact police.”</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made. At 9am on Sunday, National Rail trains were <a href="https://twitter.com/nationalrailenq/status/1198525259374309376">not stopping</a> at West Ealing station.</p>
      <p>Separately, detectives are also appealing for witnesses after a 27-year-old man was fatally stabbed at a house party in Whitechapel, east London, on Saturday morning. Three others were injured.</p>
      <p>Seven men aged between 24 and 29 have been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Six remain in police custody and one is receiving treatment in hospital for injuries sustained in the incident.</p>
      <p>The victim’s next of kin have been informed but formal identification has not yet been made.</p>
      <p>DI Will White said: “I am keen to hear from anyone who was at the party in Buckle Street on Saturday. Even if you think you have nothing to offer, please do make the call.”</p>
