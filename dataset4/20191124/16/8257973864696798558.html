      <h1>Michael Bloomberg officially enters race for president as Democrat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:29:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Allen Cone</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Michael_Bloomberg/?tps=1">Michael Bloomberg</a>, a self-made billionaire and former New York City mayor for 12 years, officially became a candidate Sunday for U.S. president, a little more than two months before Democratic caucuses and primaries take place.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, made the announcement on his <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/">campaign website</a>, with a goal of removing Republican <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> as president: "I'm running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg joins a crowded field for the Democratic nomination, which included 10 in last week's debate in Atlanta and seven others who didn't qualify, including <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Deval_Patrick/?tps=1">Deval Patrick</a>, who announced his candidacy on <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/14/Ex-Massachusetts-Gov-Deval-Patrick-enters-presidential-race/4991573732327/?mp=4">Nov. 14</a>.</p>
      <p>He won't compete in the Iowa and Nevada caucuses as well as the New Hampshire South Carolina primaries in February.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/08/Bloomberg-files-to-run-for-president-in-Alabama-primary/2471573256970/">On Nov. 8</a>, he submitted the paperwork to be included on the Alabama Democratic primary ballot though he hadn't officially announced his candidacy.</p>
      <p>Alabama is among the states with primaries on March 3, also known as Super Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg plans to self-fund his candidacy, including placing at least $37 million worth of television advertising over the next two weeks in around 100 markets, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG. The only other candidate with a significant ad buy is fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, who will have aired nearly $63 million of TV ads.</p>
      <p>"I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead," Bloomberg said on his website</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who has a Master of Business from Harvard, is a philanthropist and owns Bloomberg News. He is currently worth $54.1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#1e6f18fb1417">Forbes</a>.</p>
      <p>He was elected mayor of New York City, first as a Republican in 2001 even though the nation's largest city is heavily Democratic but became an independent during his second term. He registered as a Democrat in 2018.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg spent more than $100 million to help the party take control of the House during the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
      <p>In March, Bloomberg said he wasn't running and instead wanted to focus his efforts to attack climate change and gun violence.</p>
      <p>But now he doesn't think any one of the candidates can beat Trump next November, several people close to the former mayor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020-election/index.html">told CNN</a>. Bloomberg is considered a moderate like former Vice President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Biden/?tps=1">Joe Biden</a>, who has led most nationwide and state polls, and South Ben Mayor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pete-Buttigieg/?tps=1">Pete Buttigieg</a>, who has climbed to first place in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
      <p>The top liberals are Sens. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bernie_Sanders/?tps=1">Bernie Sanders</a> of Vermont and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Elizabeth_Warren/?tps=1">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>Warren said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/michael-bloomberg-launches-2020-presidential-bid-n1090216">Saturday night</a> in Manchester, N.H: "This election should not be for sale." She added she doesn't think the race "is going to be about TV ads versus TV ads" but instead about "grassroots movements."</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Sanders said at a Town Hall in Hillsboro, N.H: "We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections."</p>
      <p>Three other Senators also are running: <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cory_Booker/?tps=1">Cory Booker</a> of New Jersey, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kamala_Harris/?tps=1">Kamala Harris</a> of California and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amy_Klobuchar/?tps=1">Amy Klobuchar</a> of Minnesota.</p>
      <p>"I don't think a person, just because they have billions of dollars, should sit back and say, 'you know what, yeah, I think I'll run for election right now and drop $100 million,' " Booker told a crowd in Concord, N.H., on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Klobuchar, also campaigning in New Hampshire -- New London -- on Saturday, said she doesn't "believe you get the best candidate when there's such a bias in terms of money. I don't believe that's how this works."</p>
