      <p>Cape Town City have confirmed that another one of their midfielders is in the final stage of rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>Abbubaker Mobara had a disappointing start to his career at the Citizens, after an injury has left him on the sidelines for the past two months.</p>

      <p>However, after confirming that Chris David will return to first team training at the end of the month, City have revealed that Mobara will begin light training in the next two weeks.</p>

      <p>The Citizens currently have Mobara, David, Tashreeq Morris and Peter Leeuwenburgh out with long-term injuries so far and also have one less player in their midfield department after Mpho Makola was given a six-month ban from football.</p>
      <p>The Mother City-based club, who are now under the mentorship of Jan Olde Riekerink, will get back in to action on November 27, with an away trip to Bloemfontein Celtic.</p>
