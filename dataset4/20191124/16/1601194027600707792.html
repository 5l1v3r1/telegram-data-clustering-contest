      <p>North Queensland Cowboys director of rugby Peter Parr believes the 2015 NRL champions have pulled off a major coup by signing Valentine Holmes on a six-year deal.</p>
      <p>Former Cronulla Sharks star Holmes was released from the New York Jets' practice squad on Friday, seven months after arriving in the United States to pursue his dream of playing in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Holmes failed to make the Jets' 53-man playing roster after joining the International Player Pathway Program.</p>
      <p>The Jets stated that the 24-year-old was eyeing a return to Australia and North Queensland on Sunday announced Townsville is his destination.</p>
      <p>Parr expects Holmes, who played full-back for much of his time with the Sharks and scored 22 tries in 26 games in 2018, to carry on where he left on off in his rugby league career.</p>

      <p>"This is a wonderful signing for our club," Cowboys director of football Parr said.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't long ago that Valentine was one of the best players in the competition before his courageous decision to go to the NFL. His form in 2018 was as good as any player in the NRL, particularly in the second half of that season.</p>
      <p>"He's a proven big-game player, he's won a Grand Final and he's played some terrific football for both Queensland and Australia.</p>
      <p>"Valentine has been a top-class performer at wing and full-back and we've made no secret we had a desire to strengthen our outside back stocks.</p>
      <p>"Val's record speaks for itself and we couldn't be more excited about securing him at the Cowboys for the next six seasons."</p>
      <p>Holmes has scored 13 tries in 17 Tests for Australia.</p>
