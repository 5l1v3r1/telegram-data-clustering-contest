      <p>The premiere of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/stone-cold-steve-austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>'s "The Broken Skull Sessions" is on the horizon, and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>has been giving us several sneak peeks into the episode, via its Youtube channel. A new clip has just been uploaded on the channel, which shows Mark Calaway talking about his transformation to The American Bada** in May 2000.</p>
      <p>After a short hiatus in early 2000, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/the-undertaker">The Undertaker</a> made his WWE return in May, and came out donning a completely different gimmick. The Phenom had taken a biker identity, and was sporting bandanas and sunglasses. He also began coming down to the ring on a motorcycle. This drastic change in character was hailed by many, though there were some who weren't too thrilled with it.</p>

      <p>While speaking with Steve Austin on the premiere of "The Broken Skull Sessions", Mark Calaway revealed why he made the transition to The American Bada**.</p>
      <blockquote>I always felt like if I started feeling stale, my audience is probably feeling it before me, 'cause you get wrapped up in what you're doing. So, the small changes, the breaks at the right time. But I don't think I would've made it through if I hadn't changed when I did go to "The American Bada**". The character, I don't think would've lasted through The Attitude Era.</blockquote>
