      <h1>Sony Xperia 5 gets bootloader unlock and Open Devices support</h1>

      <p>Despite not being the favorite OEM of many, Sony Mobile has done a lot for the Android ecosystem. Between supporting the efforts of open source developers by contributing to AOSP and the advent and upkeep of their Open Devices program, there’s a lot to be said for Sony’s dedication to Android. The Open Devices program is an initiative that provides working AOSP code for Sony smartphones that are a part of the program. Developers can then use this working AOSP code to make custom ROMs. The Sony Xperia 5 is the latest addition to the Open Devices program.</p>
      <p>Of course, to boot a custom ROM, you do need to have an unlocked bootloader as well. As a result, Sony has also announced that the Sony Xperia 5 can now be bootloader unlocked. The company has published build guides for AOSP for smartphones in the Open Devices program, and you’ll be able to modify and build your own custom ROMs to boot on the Xperia 5 with ease. You can view the working source code for an AOSP build for the Sony Xperia 5 on GitHub, which you can sync and compile. There are even <a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/kernel-compilation-guides/">kernel compilation guides</a> and guides to <a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/access-uart-ports/">access the UART port</a>.</p>
      <p>The Sony Xperia 5 is the latest smartphone from the company to be added to the Open Devices program. The Xperia 1, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xperia-10-xperia-10-plus-open-devices-program/">10, and 10 Plus</a> were all added this year as well. Despite waning interest in Sony’s smartphones over the years, the company has remained committed to the developer community.
