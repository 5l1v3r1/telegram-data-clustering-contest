      <p>A woman, who was believed to have joined Islamic State (IS) group returned back to Germany along with her three children, police said, reports an agency. </p>
      <p>Laura is the first adult female member to return to Germany from Syria through official channels. The 30-year-old, who originally hailed from Hesse state arrived at Frankfurt airport on a flight from Erbil in Iraq late on Saturday. </p>
      <p>As per a report by German newsweekly Spiegel, Laura was not immediately arrested on arrival but remains the subject of an investigation on suspicion of her membership to a terrorist organisation as well as failure to properly take care of her children. </p>
      <p>The woman's passport has been confiscated and the two children are being entrusted to a close relative, the report added. </p>
      <p>The weekly magazine also said that the woman travelled to Syria to join IS with her two children and husband, a Somalia-born US citizen. <br/> <br/>The woman had already been linked to Salafist (Islamic fundamentalist) circles in Germany and she had also allegedly posted an online call for aid donation for Syria that in reality went to a fundamentalist organisation. Following her own capture by Kurdish forces and the reported killing of her husband, Laura claims to have turned away from IS ideology. </p>
      <p>A US aid organisation helped Laura move to Erbil from from the Al-Hol prison camp in northeastern Syria, the weekly reported. </p>
      <p>Kurdish authorities have repeatedly urged Western countries to accept their nationals linked to IS. So far, the countries have majorly avoided the repatriation. </p>
      <p>Laura is the first adult who is repatriated to Germany, a country which has allowed a few orphans to return back. </p>
      <p>After Turkey invaded northern Syria last month, a lot of people broke out from Kurdish-led jails and camps. </p>
      <p>Two weeks earlier, Turkey said that it will repatriate seven captured IS fighters to Germany.</p>
      <p>Austria, Belgium, Britain and France have repatriated some orphaned children. A number of women and children were accepted by the United States. </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, an Albanian boy taken by his mother to join IS in Syria returned to his home in Italy. </p>
      <p>Dozens of women and children were repatriated by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kosovo too.</p>
