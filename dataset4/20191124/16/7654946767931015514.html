      <p>A woman who says she was repeatedly raped by Jeffrey Epstein claims the late pedophile used his close friendship with Prince Andrew to help lure his vulnerable victims, according to an interview Sunday.</p>
      <p>Chauntae Davies <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10409881/jeffrey-epstein-rape-paedophile-island-prince-andrew/">told The Sun on Sunday</a> how Epstein repeatedly bragged about how close he was with the Duke of York and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson — even adorning his home with their photos.</p>
      <p>“I was very aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew and Fergie right away,” Davies, now 40, told the UK paper.</p>
      <p>“It was one of several bragging tactics he used to further induce his power and privilege. He bragged a lot.</p>
      <p>“He had framed photos of them in his residences. He bragged about how he’d lent money to the duchess,” she said, <a href="https://nypost.com/2011/03/07/duchess-of-york-sarah-ferguson-sorry-for-letting-jeffrey-epstein-pay-her-debt/">referring to the $24,000 Fergie borrowed</a> and in 2011 called “a gigantic error of judgment.”</p>
      <p>Davies, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/20/virginia-giuffre-says-she-had-sex-with-prince-andrew-at-age-17/">claims to have been raped</a> by Epstein over several years, says she was horrified by Andrew’s recent “car crash” interview with the BBC that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/prince-andrew-kicked-out-of-buckingham-palace-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">sparked his dramatic downfall</a>, ending his royal duties.</p>
      <p>She was furious at his “pompous” claim that Epstein was guilty of “unbecoming” behavior, saying, “It’s minimalizing something that has shattered lives.”</p>
      <p>She was also stunned when the royal said he did not regret his friendship with the convicted pedophile because of the wealth of contacts it provided. “It’s such a ­distasteful thing to say in regards to a professional predator,” she said.</p>
      <p>Davies also queried how Andrew could have been oblivious to Epstein’s perversions given that he spent so much time with him, staying in his Manhattan mansion as well as his private island, Little Saint James.</p>
      <p>“There is no way you could have been a friend of Jeffrey’s and not know what was going on,” she insisted.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see how you could see somebody with another young girl all the time and there never being a conversation about it. It doesn’t add up.”</p>
      <p>Davies says she was a 21-year-old trainee massage therapist when she first worked for Epstein — claiming he performed a sex act on himself during their first session.</p>
      <p>She claims he was “charming and intelligent” in public but “behind closed doors a monster came out.”</p>
      <p>Davies told the paper she finally escaped years of abuse from Epstein in 2005/.</p>
      <p>She “told everything” to the FBI in July this year — and the pedophile was arrested just five days later.</p>
      <p>After being hit with a slew of serious sex crimes charges, Epstein was found hanged in his Manhattan lockup in August.</p>
      <p>“He has destroyed my life in every way. Relationships, family life, health, job,” Davies told The Sun.</p>
      <p>“How did he manage to do this for so long to so many people?”</p>
