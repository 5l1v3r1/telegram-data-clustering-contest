      <h2>Al's hiding a whopping secret and wants to protect it at all costs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:25:57+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Entertainment Daily</a></address>
      <p>Billy Fletcher is going to be framed for the attack on Al Chapman on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>.</p>
      <p>Evil Al survived the attack by the hooded figure and will on Monday insist that he knows that it was Billy who attacked him and left him for dead.</p>
      <p>But his business partner Kim Tate begins to have her own suspicions about Al's claims when he declines to go to the police.</p>
      <p>Fans know it's no secret how much Al and Billy detest each other.</p>

      <p>So if Al had a surefire way of ensuring Billy went back to prison by accusing him of the assault to the police, then surely he would take it?</p>
      <p>Instead he just tells people in the village how violent Billy is and refuses to make it official.</p>
      <p>And with Billy strenuously protesting his innocence, Al starts to look more and more shifty, leading to Dawn beginning to investigate him.</p>
      <p>Deciding to follow him, she stumbles across him doing a dodgy meeting with a stranger</p>

      <p>Al appears to be handing over the keys to his expensive sports car - could he have run up debts he can't afford and now being attacked to pay it back?</p>
      <p>Last week fans watched him phone son Ellis in Dubai and beg him to invest in the factory with his earnings.</p>
      <p>It was that conversation that sparked the row between Al and Billy, with Billy stepping in to defend his brother against Al.</p>
      <p>He told him: "Aren't there any other mugs you could try and get money off rather than your own son?</p>
      <p>"Are you skint or what? Just admit you're in trouble. Ellis is trying to make something of himself and he's in a good place.</p>
      <p>"If you've got problems with cashflow leave him out of it."</p>
      <p>Someone was obviously annoyed at Al enough to try to kill him - but who was it?</p>
      <p>Who do you think attacked Al? <b><i>Leave us a comment on</i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentdailyfix"> <i>our Facebook page @EntertainmentDailyFix</i></a><i> and let us know what you think!</i></b></p>
