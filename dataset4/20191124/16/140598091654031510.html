      <p>West Ham United are considering how much longer they can give Manuel Pellegrini to turn around a disastrous sequence of results which has seen the club drop to 16<sup>th</sup> in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There is alarm that Pellegrini may not be grasping the seriousness of the situation with West Ham fearing that they are being dragged into a relegation battle after a run of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">five defeats and two draws in their last seven league games</a>.</p>
      <p>West Ham have not won since beating Manchester United at home on September 22, having also crashed out of Carabao Cup, 4-0, against League One Oxford United with Saturday’s 3-2 loss at the London Stadium to Tottenham Hotspur prompting an angry reaction from fans.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini is the highest-paid manager in West Ham’s history, earning around £7million – more than twice his predecessors – but the club is reluctantly prepared to pay him off if there is not a significant improvement in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>In saying that West Ham are understandably desperate for Pellegrini to succeed, having invested heavily in the squad since he was hired in the summer of 2018, and want to give the 66-year-old Chilean as much time as possible.</p>
      <p>West Ham’s board prefer their managers to see out their contracts before making a change or, at least, leaving it until the end of a season so that the campaign can be reviewed before a decision is made. Pellegrini has 19 months left on his current contracts.</p>
      <p>As with some other Premier League clubs the lack of a viable alternative to Pellegrini may also buy him more time but that will only go so far at West Ham where several players are struggling for form.</p>

      <p>There are mitigating circumstances with goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski sorely missed since damaging a hip in September and with little faith from the players in his under-study Roberto, who was signed by Pellegrini and the director of football, Mario Husillos, who the manager also recommended to the club.</p>
      <p>Fabianski is not expected to return until at least the new year with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/breaking-glass-ceiling-mid-table-premier-league-clubs-could/">West Ham looking to sign another goalkeeper when the window opens.</a> Pablo Fornals, a £24million recruit from Villarreal, has struggled while £45million record signing Sebastian Haller has not scored since August.</p>
      <p>West Ham’s next run of games are against Chelsea, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Arsenal which may seal Pellegrini’s fate. It will be interesting to see whether Pellegrini keeps faith with Roberto or turns to third-choice goalkeeper David Martin who joined on a free transfer from Millwall in the summer.</p>
