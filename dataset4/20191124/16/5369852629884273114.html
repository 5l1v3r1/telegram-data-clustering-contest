      <p>THERE WAS A nice piece of history written at the National Cross Country Championships today, as two sisters made the senior women’s podium for the first time ever.</p>
      <p>Fionnuala McCormack stormed to the gold medal — her ninth national title — in style, leading the field from gun to tape, to record a time of 28.41 in the 8km.</p>

      <p>Her sister, Una Britton, landed bronze in the same race, making the senior women’s event at the Irish Life Health National Senior, Junior and Juvenile Even Age Cross Country Championships a real family affair.</p>
      <p>And afterwards, the Kilcoole AC duo shared their joy at the Sport Ireland Campus:</p>

      <p>“Getting to be on the podium with her is definitely good,” Britton smiled afterwards, while her Olympian sister added: “It’s a great day for our family, for our club, and it’s always good when you stand on top of any podium.”</p>
      <p>Now, they both head to Lisbon for the Europeans.</p>
      <p>It tops a good few weeks for Wicklow star McCormack, who recently smashed her marathon PB to <a href="https://www.the42.ie/mccormack-tokyo-2020-4850292-Oct2019/">secure Tokyo 2020 qualification</a>. But she shone at her beloved Cross Country today.</p>

      <p>It was Portlaoise AC’s Mary Mulhare who finished second, while elsewhere, Tullamore Harriers’ Liam Brady produced a brave run from the front to take the senior men’s 10,000m crown.</p>
