      <p>
        <b>Pairc Ui Rinn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Borrisoleigh 1-12 Ballygunner 1-11</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Borris_GAA">Borrisoleigh</a> are the Munster senior hurling for the first time since 1986 following a narrow one-point win over reigning champions Ballygunner in Pairc Ui Rinn.</p>

      <p>Kieran Maher’s second-half goal proved crucial for the Tipperary champions but it was inter-county star <a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/kennedymarisa760/brendan-maher-borris-lleigh-ballygunner/">Brendan Maher</a> who inspired his side to victory.</p>
      <p>Little could separate the sides in the opening 30 minutes but fine work from Dessie Hutchinson helped the Waterford side to a three-point lead at the break. The margin remained as such until Ray McCormack set up Maher for the goal in the 45th minute.</p>
      <p>Brendan Maher hit an inspirational point immediately after the goal to give Borris the advantage but Ballygunner responded with a goal from Barry O’Sullivan in the 51st minute to ensure a tight finish.</p>

      <h3>Connacht club SFC final</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Tuam Stadium</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Corofin 1-10 Padraig Pearses 0-7</i>

      <p>Liam Silke gave a man-of-the-match performance and it was his goal midway through the second half which put daylight between the sides.</p>
      <p>Corofin enjoyed a three-point lead at the break but points from Paul Carey and Ronan Steede saw the Roscommon side level matters 10 minutes after the break.</p>
      <p>However, following Silke’s goal, Corofin pushed on and scores from Michael Farragher and Jason Leonard put them out of reach despite the best efforts of Pearses.</p>

      <h3>Leinster club SFC semi-final</h3>
      <p>
        <b>TEG Cusack Park</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Garrycastle 0-12 Ballyboden St Endas 3-14</i>
      </p>

      <p>The Dublin outfit dominated from start to finish and led 1-10 to 0-5 with the goal coming from Robbie McDaid in the opening minutes.</p>
      <p>Garrycastle began the second half promisingly with three unanswered frees from the boot of Dessie Dolan but Ballyboden soon responded with points from McDaid and Ross McGarry to quell their momentum.  Goals from Colm Basquel and James Holland inside the last 10 minutes ensured the dominant win and a place in their first final since 2018.</p>
