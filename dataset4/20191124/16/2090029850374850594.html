      <p>In a report by <i><a href="https://punchng.com/">The Punch</a>, </i>the killer cop shot into the air to disperse the crowd, killing his colleague and injuring a ride-hailing motorcyclist in the process.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the police officer and the deceased were members of the police team that was mobilised to a section of the road on Saturday, November 23, 2019, to arrest motorcyclists plying prohibited routes and riding against traffic.</p>
      <p>Trouble started when the team arrested a commercial motorcyclist for allegedly breaking traffic rule, but the rider resisted arrest and struggled with the policemen who wanted to seize his bike.</p>
      <p>A witness<b>, Kunle Gbadamosi</b>, revealed that the Police killed his colleague after he cocked his gun to shoot into the air so as to disperse the crowd.</p>
      <p>He said<i>:</i></p>
      <blockquote>“I was on a bus en route to Igando from Iyana-Iba when I chanced on the incident. It caused traffic and I decided to alight from the bus. I saw a policeman lying lifeless on the floor. There was confusion everywhere.<br/><br/>“I learnt that some policemen were trying to arrest motorcyclists riding against the traffic and on prohibited routes. One of the motorcyclists they were trying to arrest resisted and his co-riders rallied round him because they felt the policemen wanted to extort him.<br/><br/>“One mobile policeman, who was trying to assist the policemen to get out of the situation, cocked and fired into the air to disperse the crowd. He shot and killed a policeman in the process.”</blockquote>
