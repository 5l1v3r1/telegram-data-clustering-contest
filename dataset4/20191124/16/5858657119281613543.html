      <p>DETROIT — A United Auto Workers union official charged in a widening federal bribery and embezzlement scandal has resigned.</p>
      <p>The union said Sunday that Vance Pearson also will retire and resign from his membership in the union. He had been on paid administrative leave.</p>
      <p>Pearson was the director of a region in Missouri. He was charged by federal prosecutors in September in connection with a scheme to embezzle union money and spend thousands on premium booze, golf clubs, cigars and swanky stays in California.</p>
      <p>Former UAW President Gary Jones has been implicated in the scheme but has not been charged. Jones resigned last week.</p>
      <p>The UAW had moved to expel both men from the union.</p>
      <p>So far, 13 people have been charged in the federal investigation.</p>
