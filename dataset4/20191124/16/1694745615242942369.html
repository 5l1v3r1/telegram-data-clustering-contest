      <p>Tired of the traditional Thanksgiving dinner? OK, probably not, because I don't know about you, but there's only one day out of the year where I can have all the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Turkey-Cooking-Tips-42712407">turkey</a>, gravy, green beans, and pumpkin pie I want. It's not likely that I'll be getting sick of these dishes any time soon, but I still like to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Healthy-Vegan-Thanksgiving-Recipes-42657020">add something new into the mix</a> every now and then. Without straying too far from Fall flavors, I took one of my favorite simple and quick family recipes for lasagna and turned it into a perfect addition to a holiday feast.</p>
      <p>Picture garlicky greens, buttery mushrooms, spiced Italian sausage, and creamy ricotta all nestled into a pillow of pasta. Are you hungry yet? We didn't forget the star of this dish, butternut squash, because it wouldn't be a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Best-Thanksgiving-Desserts-45444037">Fall-inspired recipe</a> without the sweet staple. If you're ready to introduce your family and friends to something new that will blow their minds this season, follow along!</p>

      <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
      <p>First thing's first: preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
      <h3>Cook the vegetables.</h3>

      <p>In a pan over medium heat, melt the butter with the olive oil. Add the mushrooms, and season with garlic, oregano, sage, salt, and pepper and cook for three to five minutes — just until they brown and soften. Add in the spinach and cook for one more minute. The spinach should wilt very quickly. Once that's done, you can remove the mixture from the heat and set it aside.</p>
      <h3>Cook the lasagna sheets.</h3>

      <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta sheets and cook for 3/4 of the recommended time. The pasta will finish cooking in the oven. Drain the pasta and immediately separate on to a parchment sheet so they don't stick.</p>
      <h3>Assemble the lasagna rolls.</h3>

      <p>First, slather about two tablespoons of butternut squash puree onto each lasagna sheet and spread evenly across. Evenly distribute the vegetable medley throughout all the sheets. Next, place small dollops of ricotta across the sheets. Sprinkle with bits of sausage and top with half of the shredded mozzarella. Roll tightly.</p>
      <p>*Depending on the size of your pan, you can fit about 10 rolls squished together (my 10-inch pan fit nine).</p>
      <h3>The secret to amazing lasagna rolls . . .</h3>

      <p>If you're making lasagna rolls, a key to making sure they stay saucy and moist after cooking in the oven is to line the bottom of your pan with sauce and cheese. The rolls will then go directly on top so they're swimming in a pool of creamy goodness. Just put enough Alfredo to completely cover the base and sprinkle some cheese.</p>
      <h3>Prepare the dish for baking.</h3>

      <p>Roll all of your lasagna sheets and arrange in a pan standing upright for maximum aesthetic. Top off with the rest of the Alfredo sauce and sprinkle the top with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese.</p>
      <h3>Bake, serve, and enjoy.</h3>

      <p>Toss the lasagna rolls in the oven and bake until the cheese on top is crispy and golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let it rest for 10 minutes. Then, remove one roll at a time to serve. Garnish with parmesan cheese and dig in.</p>
