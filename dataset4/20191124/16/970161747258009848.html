      <p>Blue Story is proving to be one of the most controversial British films in years.</p>
      <p>The film, directed by Andrew ‘Rapman’ Onwubolu – has found itself at the centre of a storm after an all-out <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/cinema-lockdown-gang-machetes-brawl-assault-police-officers-11207932/">brawl broke out during a showing of the film</a> in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Armed police were on the scene after people with machetes at Star City, in the Nechells area of the city were reported, shortly after 5.30pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A group of more than 100 people were there, with ‘pockets of fighting’ breaking out as families queued to see Frozen 2.</p>
      <p>The incident has led to reports that the film is being pulled from Vue cinemas across the country.</p>
