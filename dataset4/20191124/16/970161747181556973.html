      <p>A blue hedgehog has all of a sudden wreaked havoc on the internet. Who knew such small creatures wielded such dominant power?</p>
      <p>When Sonic the Hedgehog’s Hollywood endeavour was first glimpsed in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/30/sonic-hedgehog-trailer-jim-carrey-gangstas-paradise-lot-unpack-9366351/">form of a trailer,</a> every man and his dog was up in arms over how the little fella looked and how ‘not funny’ the film appeared on first glance.</p>
      <p>Not even fictional animal characters originating in 1991 can escape heated critique, it appears. The heat got so bad, in fact, that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/sonic-hedgehog-redesign-officially-unveiled-new-trailer-drops-cgi-backlash-11083459/">a new trailer was made to appease the punters.</a> Even though we should all be celebrating the fact he’s getting a big screen welcome at all.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the viral backlash, editors put together a fresh trailer that took the armchair critiques into account, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/sonic-hedgehog-movie-redesigned-sonic-mania-artist-11090984/">redesigning the whole thing</a> and showing how seriously Hollywood takes the fandom’s love of this nostalgic character.</p>

      <p>But <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/sonic-hedgehogs-original-creator-still-feels-weird-design-new-trailer-11124367/">punters still aren’t convinced they’ll be getting a gaming-accurate representation</a> of Sonic, let alone a funny one – so even if the re-designed trailer had been revealed first, Sonic would still be causing mass outrage in the gaming community.</p>
      <p>The film’s studio was forced to fork out millions – MILLIONS – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/02/sonic-hedgehog-movie-will-fix-character-design-following-trailer-backlash-9395038/">delayed release by three months</a> to keep an army of screeching fans happy and make the character look more like the Sonic of their dreams.</p>
      <p>Evidently gaming fans hold such pull over Hollywood that a bunch of execs signed off on expensive edits to appease the baying crowds. If that doesn’t speak to the sway of fandom, I don’t know what will.</p>
      <p>It seems no matter how many edits are made, Sonic will never look close enough to his iconic gaming likeness and this exposes how Hollywood is doomed to fail on fan-favourite pop culture icons.</p>

      <p>No one is taking away your right to game with Sonic if the character isn’t a perfect representation in a film, but think not about how outraged you are and about what can be gained from sharing the greatness with a new generation.</p>

      <p>Sonic is the 14th biggest game in history so it’s clear there are millions of fans who don’t want to see his profile tarnished by the big wigs of Hollywood, or perhaps even projected into a film in the first place.</p>
      <p>Yet I think the backlash has uncovered a certain toxicity within the fandom which sees hardcore gaming loyalists refuse to accept any sort of deviation from what they believe to be the ultimate Sonic. Which, I should add, is perfectly subjective.</p>
      <p>I can never understand why we can’t just enjoy nice things as they arise without comparing them to others. In this case, Sonic has been compared to the Detective Pikachu film as if they were Kardashians.</p>
      <p>What I <i>can</i> understand, though, is that long-time fans may be feeling jilted, and that’s where I hear you.</p>

      <p>Sonic is super important to the gaming community and I get that, which explains why loyalists are wondering what the heck was done with the creature – a blaspheme on the good name of Sonic. Because how dare Hollywood turn the poor sod into a family-friendly, aesthetically-pleasing, sort-of-funny-looking, trying-to-attract-a-fresh-audience film, right in front of your eyes.</p>
      <p>I hate to say it but Sonic was always doomed on the big screen. Just think about the Mario and Luigi big screen endeavour (or, you know, don’t). If we’re not complaining about their eyes, we’re hating on the plot.</p>
      <p>We need to learn to separate the two genres and (at least try to) appreciate them for what they are in the world of entertainment. For our own sanity.</p>
      <p>A gaming character can’t be dropped on Hollywood Boulevard without certain alterations and visa versa; this is not new information, people. And, look, had they kept him all cartoonish, I hazard a guess the vitriol would still show.</p>
      <p>Big picture thinking tells me this Hollywood outing will expose new people to Sonic who might not have discovered him on a Sega Megadrive naturally and what’s wrong with having a few new million fans to prop up your beloved Sonic?</p>
      <p>Let’s support our little pal and stop caring so much as to whether his teeth are jagged enough in high-def.</p>
