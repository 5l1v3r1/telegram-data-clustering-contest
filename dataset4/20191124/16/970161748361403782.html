      <p>Jeremy Clarkson’s eyes have been opened to the climate crisis after filming a recent episode of The Grand Tour.</p>
      <p>The presenter has made no secret of his issues with environmentalists in the past.</p>
      <p>His epiphany came during filming of an episode in southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Along with Richard Hammond and James May, the trio attempted to navigate the Mekong river, but they found parts of it had dried up leaving the presenter ‘genuinely alarmed’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/and-on-that-bombshell-jeremy-clarkson-is-a-climate-change-believer-rgdfnfnss">Jeremy told The Times</a>: ‘The irony is not lost on me. A man who hosted a car programme for 30 years, limited to 7mph by global warming.</p>
      <p>‘It’s the first time that we’ve ever admitted to there being global warming. We were completely screwed on that [trip].’</p>
      <p>He added that one lake, Tonle Sap, used to be ‘knee-deep’ but when he was there there was no water.</p>

      <p>It meant that filming was regularly scuppered with their boat either running aground or having to be towed.</p>

      <p>In a swipe at climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, Jeremy said: ‘It was alarming, genuinely alarming. But we don’t blame mankind for it. We’ll let Greta [Thunberg] do that.’</p>
      <p>The Grand Tour season four will kick off with the first of its ‘feature-length epic road trips’ next month.</p>
      <p>The episode is called The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen and in their announcement of the new season’s release date Amazon Prime say: ‘For one time only, the presenters have taken a break from four wheels and instead undertaken an ambitious journey in boats. Their adventure-packed voyage takes them along one of the world’s most iconic waterways – the Mekong Delta.</p>
      <p>‘Fans can expect elements of their previous classic road trips, with the trio choosing their boats in the usual way they choose their cars, with their own off-the-wall rationale, putting their own spin on their individual vessels… as well as each other’s.’</p>
      <p>Amazon Prime also recently confirmed that filming has wrapped on episode two in Madagascar.</p>
