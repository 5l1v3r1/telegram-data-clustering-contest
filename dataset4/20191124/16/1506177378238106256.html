      <p>A family is in mourning after a 37-year-old father of four was killed driving back home to Lamia, after attending a wedding in Athens with his wife and their two eldest children.</p>
      <p>The man has been identified as Nikos Barberis and his wife was taken back to a hospital in Athens in an ambulance with serious injuries. Doctors have said that the two children will also require surgery.</p>
      <p>The two youngest siblings did not attend the wedding and were home when the horrific car accident occurred.</p>
      <p>According to <i>lamiareport.gr</i>, the deadly collision happened just minutes before 5 am, when the black Mercedes, which was owned by the family of four from Lamia, crashed head-on with a BMW.</p>
      <p>The driver of the other vehicle was a young man who had a friend in the car at the time, however, neither of them were injured.</p>
      <p>Police are currently investigating the circumstances of the accident that resulted in fatal injuries.</p>
