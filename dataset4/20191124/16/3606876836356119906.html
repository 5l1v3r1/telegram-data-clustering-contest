"Calculate how many minutes of the day you spend scrolling on your phone at useless feeds," he told Men's Health <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a25934824/chris-hemsworth-thor-workout-app-interview/">earlier this year </a>. "Hours, right? So you cant find 20 minutes a day? If you cant find that 20 minutes, you have no one to blame but yourself."</b>

      <p>And that philosophy applies even when the equipment around you isn't exactly what you're used to as one of the most <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a28198560/superhero-shred-workout-routine/">jacked superhero stars </a>on the planet. The Australian actor just <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a29536889/chris-hemsworth-dumbbell-workout-instagram/">live-streamed his workout </a>on his <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a29245163/chris-hemsworth-instagram-circuit-workout-centr/">Instagram Story </a>, demonstrating a series of moves from his fitness and wellness app, <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a26086239/chris-hemsworth-centr-app/">Centr </a>.</p>
      <p>"We're in Tokyo, in I think it's the world's smallest gym," he said. "But we make use of what we've got."</p>

        <p>"Grow! Grow! Grow!" He chanted to his biceps while doing a set on the arm pull machine, before switching to <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a29872484/pushups-every-day-month-workout-video/">pushups </a>, then working his core with a series of <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a29129857/demarcus-ware-medicine-ball-abs-workout-instagram/">medicine ball </a>exercises.</p>
        <p>"Realistically, theres a very low chance any of us will achieve the same body as Thor or any beefcake movie superhero, but there are small changes you can make in your life to be more like him," writes <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a28687546/i-trained-and-ate-like-thor-chris-hemsworth-workout/">Esquire </a><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a28687546/i-trained-and-ate-like-thor-chris-hemsworth-workout/"> 's Jamie Carson </a>, who ate and trained like Hemsworth for a week, basing his regime on how the movie prepared for his role in the Thor and Marvel movies. "You dont need a superpower. Just the willpower," he added. "And chicken. Lots and lots of chicken."</p>
