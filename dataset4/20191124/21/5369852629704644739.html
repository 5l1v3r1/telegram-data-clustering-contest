      <p>IRISH JOCKEY DONNACHA O’Brien has announced his retirement.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, who is the son of renowned trainer Aidan O’Brien and brother of jockey and trainer Joseph O’Brien, said he wanted to focus on training from now on.</p>
      <p>He enjoyed significant success during his short career. He was crowned Irish champion jockey earlier this year, retaining his 2018 title.</p>
      <p>He also <a href="https://www.the42.ie/joy-for-aidan-obrien-as-magical-triumphs-4859025-Oct2019/">won the Champion Stakes at Ascot</a> last October and picked up 10 top-level wins in total.</p>
      <p>“After thinking about things for a while, I have decided to concentrate on training next year,” O’Brien wrote on his official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>“Riding has been very good to me and I owe everything to the people around me.</p>
      <p>“I want to give special thanks to the Magnier, Smith and Tabor families, along with my own family, for all their support.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to training a small group of horses next year, and will hopefully build from there.”</p>
