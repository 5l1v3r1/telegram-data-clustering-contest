      <p>Ray White Dungog and Clarence Town will partner with Dungog Shire Community Centre to help disadvantaged people who may need a little extra light in their festive season.</p>
      <p>"This is the third year that we've run 'A Little Ray of Giving' and we want 2019 to be our biggest year yet," said Ray White principal Dee Braithwaite.</p>
      <p>"We urge everyone who is able, to bring in a gift in for those families who are less fortunate."</p>
      <p>You can drop gifts off at either Ray White Dowling Street Dungog or Grey Street Clarence Town offices until December 13.</p>
      <p>"You don't even need to wrap up your present, just drop it into our office reception in either Dungog or Clarence Town, and we will take care of the rest," said Ray White Dungog office manager Jessica Murray.</p>
      <p>"It's a really simple way to put a smile on the face of someone who might otherwise go without this Christmas," said Dungog Shire Community Centre manager Sarah U'Brien.</p>
      <p>"Just a small gift can make the biggest difference to families who are struggling at an expensive time of year."</p>
