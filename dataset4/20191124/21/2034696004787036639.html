      <p>It looks like fans of <a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-weeknd">The Weeknd</a> won’t have to wait much longer for new music from the Canadian singer as he’s teased that he’s dropping something new on Black Friday.</p>

      <p>Reportedly titled ‘Blinding Lights’, a snippet of the new song features in a Mercedes Benz commercial that aired today (November 24) on German TV channels. It mentions that the full clip will be available on November 29.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/workID/898115729">ASCAP repository</a>, the track is written and produced by The Weeknd, Belly and the singer’s longtime producer DaHeala.</p>
      <p>The new song comes after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weekend-teases-new-album-chapter-6-2536077">The Weekend teased in August</a> that his ‘Chapter VI’ album was on the way. Posting an image of himself on Twitter, he said: “album mode full effect”, much to the delight of his followers.</p>
      <p>Hinting at big things to come in a tweet last year, he said of the upcoming project: “some chapters are smaller than others. not this next one though…”</p>
      <p>Speaking to the crowd during a show in his home city of Toronto, he teased: “I wanna let you guys know, being in Toronto these past two days… I haven’t been this inspired in years, I got to tell you.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, it was reported earlier this year that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/weeknd-sued-ripping-off-british-songwriters-lonely-night-2471317">The Weeknd was being sued by a trio of British songwriters who claim that he ripped them off on his track ‘A Lonely Night’.</a></p>
      <p>William Smith, Brian Clover and Scott McCulloch claim that the US star copied their track ‘I Need To Love’ – which they previously attempted to sell across the globe in 2004 and 2005.</p>
