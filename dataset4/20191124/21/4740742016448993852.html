      <h1>Seeking the true meaning of Christmas at Universal Orlando with The Grinch, Harry Potter, Shrek and the Minions</h1>
      <h2>It’s snow time…SIAN DAVID visits Universal Orlando Resort for some seriously Christmassy holiday celebrations.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:53:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sian David</a></address>
      <p>It was snowing in Florida.</p>
      <p>The lights twinkled, the bells jingled, the lords were a-leaping and, yes, it was snowing in Florida.</p>
      <p>Snow machine snow, of course, but it was definitely beginning to look a lot like…you know.</p>
      <p>Now, I’m no Scrooge, but I’m not the only grown-up who’ll tell you that the sparkle of Christmas can tarnish a bit as you get older. But if I’ve learned anything from every Christmas film ever made, the magic of Christmas is still there - you just have to make more of an effort to find it.</p>
      <p>At Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, they go all out for the holiday season, with Christmas trees in every store, decorations throughout the parks and, most importantly, some of the most impressive festive entertainment this side of the North Pole.</p>
      <p>So, with that in mind, where better to start recapturing the magic of the holiday season than the most magical place in the world – Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
      <p>A trip to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a dream come true for every Harry Potter fan at any time of the year, but if you weren’t quite convinced of the existence of magic before a visit in holiday season, you can bet your broomstick you’ll be convinced by the end.</p>
      <p>With Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley strung with themed decorations, garlands and lights, traditional festive music from both the the wizarding and Muggle worlds drifts melodiously through the streets courtesy of Hogwarts students and their croaking frogs, as well as a special appearance from Celestina Warbeck and the Banshees, straight out of the books.</p>

      <p>Snuggled in a hoodie with a cup of hot Butterbeer, I stood among a crowd staring up at the impressive silhouette of the castle against the night sky. Silence fell, as the Hogwarts ghosts began to materialise across the front of the school, singing slightly spooky Christmas missives and signalling the start of an incredible light show – The Magic of Christmas at Hogwarts Castle.</p>
      <p>Known to millions as the most iconic piece from the Harry Potter score, the instantly recognisable Hedwig’s Theme began to tinkle out across the night as its eponymous heroine, Harry Potter’s owl, swept majestically over the towers. As the music swelled and the castle was lit up by snowfall, the electricity in the air would send a shiver of excitement down even the Grinch’s spine.</p>
      <p>Yet more familiar faces appeared in their festive finery – Hermione and Viktor Krum waltzing at the Yule Ball, the Weasley twins on their broomsticks illuminating the whole castle with banners and posters for jokes and spells and, of course, Harry himself, with ever-faithful Ron tagging along.</p>

      <p>As the finale fireworks faded into the sky, it was time to get indoors for a warm, so we headed to meet that least Christmassy of fellows, The Grinch.</p>
      <p>The Grinch is a recluse who lives in the mountains, doesn’t like Christmas or the residents of the town below (the Whos, who live in Whoville) and so, being a bit of a grump, decides to ruin their Christmas. Of course, he doesn’t count on cute little Cindy-Lou Who getting in the way…</p>
      <p>Flexi-faced Jim Carrey played the Grinch to perfection almost 20 years ago, bringing Dr Seuss’s furry green meanie to a global audience, and despite his anti-Christmas sentiment he has become one of the world’s most beloved holiday icons.</p>

      <p>At Universal this year, he is brought hilariously to life in a brightly bonkers musical theatre show, The Grinchmas Who-liday Spectacular, a condensed version of the Jim Carrey film, with plenty of rousing dance numbers and heartstring-tugging solos carving out the Grinch’s emotional arc.</p>
      <p>With a running time of around half an hour, it’s an ideal treat for families of all ages, but especially, perhaps, for littler members who don’t want to sit still for too long. Afterwards there is even the opportunity to meet the sassy green chappy himself and pose for a picture you can buy.</p>
      <p>Out into the “snow” again, this time for Universal’s Holiday Parade featuring Macy’s. It’s a very American tradition that we don’t really see in the UK, but most people will have seen New York’s Thanksgiving Day parade with the giant balloons and performers closing down part of the city in celebration.</p>
      <p>It always looks great on TV, but seeing it in person is something else. Taking place in the New York area of the Universal Studios park, studio favourites dance and wave from floats or bob by in giant balloon form while snow and ticker tape flitter down in the night sky around a giant Christmas tree – it truly doesn’t get more festive than this.</p>

      <p>The cast of Madagascar are there, as well as Shrek and Donkey and Despicable Me favourites Gru and the Minions. Little faces in the crowd light up as their heroes wave and call out festive greetings.</p>
      <p>As bescostumed performers prance and wave, wishing you “Merry Christmas!” and “Happy Holidays!” you’d be forgiven for believing, for a moment, that you’re really in one of those Christmas movies trying to convince you that the magic of Christmas never really left you.</p>
      <p>And as the parade ends with a visit from Santa, the crowd full of happy families of all kinds, rosy-cheeked and holding hands, melt away to their hotels.</p>

      <p>We stayed at Universal’s Endless Summer Resort Surfside Inn and Suites, a charming, beachy-inspired hotel with large, great value family rooms. I stayed in a suite, which came complete with a kitchenette and picnic table, as well as a separate bedroom off the main room which, itself, houses two huge beds. There’s more than enough room for a family to stay and catering is made very easy with the microwave, coffee maker and a proper-size under-counter fridge. The hotel has a Starbucks in the lobby as well as a poolside bar open until 11pm, as well as its Beach Break Café, where no meal costs more than $12, and a pizza delivery service operating from 5pm to midnight.</p>
      <p>The hotel is a lovely bridge between the Christmassy-ness of the parks and the sunshine-holiday feel of a Florida break. It’s a perfect spot on the resort for families to spend some quality time at all the Universal attractions – including theme parks Universal Studios and Universal’s Islands of Adventure, waterpark Volcano Bay and Universal Citywalk, with its dozens of shops and restaurants – while building up some festive cheer before heading home for the big day itself.</p>

      <p>Because it’s that quality time that the season is all about, really, and we all need reminding of that, sometimes. Between the stress of present-buying and decorating and rushing around for the last-minute essentials, making sure everyone’s drink is topped up, the cat’s not attacking the turkey and that Nana and Grandma aren’t arguing over the best way to make the gravy, we can all forget that it’s just being together that matters, and being glad to belong to one another. That’s the real magic of Christmas – being with the people you love.</p>
      <p>Ironically, it’s the most famous Christmas-hater himself who sums it up quite perfectly:</p>
      <p>“Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!</p>
      <p>“What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store.</p>
      <p>“What if Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more?”</p>
