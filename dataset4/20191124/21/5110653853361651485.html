      <p>D'Arnaud is coming off of a solid year in which he caught for three teams: the Mets, Dodgers and Rays. The 30-year-old backstop played most of the season with Tampa Bay, where he amassed a 1.8 fWAR in the best offensive season he has had since 2015.</p>
      <p>D'Arnaud will replace Brian McCann, who retired following the 2019 season. He will pair behind the plate with Tyler Flowers, who was re-signed by the Braves earlier in November through the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>The signing is the second big move of the Braves offseason, who signed relief pitcher Will Smith to a three-year, $39 million contract on Nov. 14.</p>
