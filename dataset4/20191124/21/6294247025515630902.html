      <p>Cape Town — Ross Brawn is confident Lewis Hamilton will overtake Michael Schumacher’s seven world titles if he stays on at Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Hamilton won his sixth Drivers’ Championship title this season, doing so with two races to spare.</p>
      <p>That put the Brit’s tally up to six, only the second driver in history to achieve that feat.</p>
      <p>He is just one away from Schumacher’s seven with his former Mercedes team Brawn believing he will break that record if he stays at Mercedes.</p>
      <p>That, though, is a big if with pundits suggesting Hamilton could be persuaded to move to Ferrari in 2021. Asked by Channel 4 if he felt Hamilton will eclipse Schumacher’s magic number of seven World Championships, Brawn replied: “I think he probably will.</p>
      <p>“Mercedes are a strong team. Even with the new regulations they will make a very good job of them.</p>
      <p>“If Lewis stays there he will win more World Championships.</p>
      <p>“I think the intrigue is: does he want a new challenge? Michael won World Championships at Benetton but then he wanted a new challenge at Ferrari, which was a big challenge.</p>
      <p>“Does Lewis want a challenge to finish off his career or is he going to stay with something that he knows well and is stable?”</p>
      <p>Brawn, who has worked with both Hamilton and Schumacher, was then asked the all-important question – Hamilton or Schumacher?</p>
      <p>“I don’t think you can answer that question,” he replied. They are quite different drivers. Michael’s character and approach was very different to Lewis.</p>
      <p>“I’ve said this before, when I first started working with Lewis I was a little nervous, because his approach is very different but he has made it work.</p>
      <p>“I can’t take anything away from Lewis. He is extremely professional but his private life is completely different to that of Michael. Michael was almost monastic in terms of his approach.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a contrast between the two. It took me a little while to adjust but he is a brilliant driver.” — Sport24.</p>
