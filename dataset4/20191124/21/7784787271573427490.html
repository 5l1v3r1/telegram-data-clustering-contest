      <h3>A-League, Premier League or the World Cup, it doesn’t matter — the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) will always find a way to make a contentious decision.</h3>
      <p>Perth Glory became the controversial technology’s latest victim with two major calls going against them in their <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/aleague-perth-glory-vs-sydney-fc-live-blog-score-start-time-how-to-watch-team-news-predicted-line-ups/news-story/3cab375794118d2aa7ed274989303f08">hotly-contested grand final replay with Sydney FC</a>.</p>

      <p>While VAR must be praised for correctly awarding Sydney an early penalty for a blatant shirt grab by Diego Castro, it later showed the same recurring inconsistency that has infuriated fans all season.</p>
      <p>The first incident came when Sky Blues recruit Kosta Barbarouses’ goal was allowed to stand despite calls for an agonisingly close offside.</p>
      <p>Barbarouses was put clean through on goal after a lofted ball from Brandon O’Neill and made no mistake with the finish as he fired the ball past Perth shot stopper Liam Reddy.</p>
      <p>But VAR quickly intervened — or so we thought.</p>
      <p>Referee Daniel Elder was made aware of a potential offside and play was subsequently delayed while VAR checked it.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, those watching in the booth judged that Barbarouses’ shoulder blade was fractionally behind Ivan Franjic’s back foot — despite clear images that indicated otherwise.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the goal stood and Perth’s resulting cries fell on deaf ears.</p>
      <p>But the VAR wasn’t done just yet.</p>
      <p>Glory were robbed of their own breakthrough goal when Bruno Fornaroli was judged to be offside after pulling one back in stunning fashion.</p>

      <p>The Perth forward, who had just become <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/aleague-news-bruno-fornaroli-becomes-fastest-player-to-score-50-aleague-goals-video-watch-perth-glory-vs-sydney-fc/news-story/074f5de6d0f1123c8cdb41c96a5cccda">the fastest player to reach 50 A-League goals</a>, rifled the ball into the back of the net with a venomous volley to reduce the deficit to just one goal.</p>
      <p>But as the 32-year-old wheeled away in passionate celebration, VAR entered the frame to a chorus of boos around nib Stadium.</p>

      <p>After a couple of minutes of deliberation, the officials chalked off the goal saying that Fornaroli received the ball in an offside position from Chris Harold’s deflected shot.</p>
      <p>“I’m disappointed about this tonight,” Fornaroli said after the game.</p>
      <p>“This changed the game.”</p>
      <p>The score ultimately ended 3-1 to Sydney FC as Steve Corica’s side moved up to second on the A-League ladder.</p>
      <p>As for Perth, they’re now in sixth place with just one win all season.</p>
