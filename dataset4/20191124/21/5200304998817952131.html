      <p>Confirming the news about the show ending, Patel also gave details about the telecast date of the show’s final episode. He said, “Yes, sadly YHM is actually going off-air this time.

The show will air its last episode on December 20.”</p>

      <p>‘Yeh Hai Mohabbatein’ has been Star Plus’ second longest running show (six years), after ‘Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai’.</p>
