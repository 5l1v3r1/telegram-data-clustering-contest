      <h1>This limited edition Death Stranding PS4 Pro is $100 off</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:40:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Gera</a></address>
      <p>Sony had cut the price of its limited-edition Death Stranding PlayStation Pro for Black Friday, but unfortunately, the deal proved to be immensely popular and it’s now sold out.</p>
      <p>First released earlier this month in parallel with the launch of Death Stranding, the limited edition PS4 Pro was available through the official PlayStation website for $299 – that’s $100 off its original sales price. The deal was scheduled to run until December 3, but it looks like Sony has run out of stock way ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>The console bundle comes with a custom 1TB PS4 pro with a case covered in the tar-like black handprints. You also get a custom yellow wireless controller, complete with creepy crying BB coos, and a copy of Death Stranding.</p>
      <p>Now, if you’re more of a console traditionalist and would rather your PS4 not be covered in handprints, you can instead get a standard black matte <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-4-pro-1tb-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-console-bundle-jet-black/6378621.p">1TB PlayStation 4 Pro with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> for the same $299 price point – down from $399. This includes a wireless controller, wired earphones, and everything you’d expect in the box. It’s unclear how much longer Best Buy will run this offer for, though!</p>
