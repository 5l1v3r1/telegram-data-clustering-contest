      <p>Zamfara State Government says no single Internally Displaced Person is in camp following the significant improvement recorded in security situation of the state.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Yusuf Idris, the Director General on Press Affairs to Goernor Bello Matawalle, made the disclosure at a press briefing held in Gusau on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to him, all the IDPs had returned to their various villages and towns, and have continued with their normal day to day activities without any threat.</p>
      <p>Idris maintained that kidnapping, rustling and all other forms of banditry had become a thing of the past in all parts of the state.</p>
      <p>He said the recent attack on Karaye village in Gummi local government area of the state was a handiwork of some unscrupulous elements who wanted to set the state backward.</p>
      <p>He said all those attempts will not distract Governor Bello Matawalle’s administration from taking the state to the promised land.</p>
      <p>He equally warned all those with evil plans against the state to desist from causing security breach or faced the consequences of their action.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria recalls that banditry activities in state have resulted in recording 37,000 internally displaced persons in various camps in the state. </p>
