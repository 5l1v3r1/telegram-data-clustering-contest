      <h1>Tupac Murder Case Should Be Closed Says Former LAPD Detective</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:03:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author">Shirley Ju</a></address>
      <p>A former detective who investigated Tupac Shakur's murder for three years is demanding the Las Vegas Police Department close the case.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> It looks like more news has been revealed regarding the murder of Tupac Shakur, who was shot and killed in Las Vegas 23 years ago.</p>
      <p>For three years, Greg Kading led a three-year federal task force into the shootings of both Tupac and Biggie.</p>
      <p>One decade ago in 2009, Kading says he discovered a major breakthrough in the murder case.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/greg-kading-speaks-on-his-murder-rap-documentary-about-the-murders-of-2pac-the-notorious-b-i-g-video-rg9AQE6MHkaHwwUapp0XsA/">Detective Kading got his hands on a recorded confession from Duane Davis (also known by his street name Keffe D), who gave an initial statement under what's known as a proffer session.</a>
      </p>
      <p>This is a meeting between a person and law enforcement where he or she is offered limited immunity for his statements (meaning they can’t be used against him).</p>
      <p>Kading claims Keffe D., who was the leader of a Crips set in Compton, admitted involvement in the Tupac slaying.</p>
      <p>Keffe D. has also publicly recounted his involvement in the incident of Tupac’s shooting on September, 7th 1996 on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>Because of this evidence, Kading is officially calling on the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to close the Tupac murder case.</p>
      <p>"A corroborated confession is one of the strongest pieces of evidence you could hope for in a criminal investigation," Greg Kading told AllHipHop in a statement. "It’s important to close the case for history’s sake, knowing that Tupac’s murder is not a mystery. Tupac’s friends and family deserve the closure that the evidence in the case provides."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Orlando ended up getting killed in a drug-related shootout at a Compton car wash in 1998. <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/tupac-murder-suspect-s-tv-confession-prompts-calls-for-investigation-22Qq5DxqNkCDJXv1eo3xmg/">Despite Keffe D.'s confession, as far as the Las Vegas Metro Police is concerned, the case remains open and unsolved.</a></p>
      <p>"Classifying the case as closed or solved does not preclude investigators from reexamining the case in the future should new evidence or information surface," Greg Kading said.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Greg Kading published his book "Murder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls &amp; Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations.'</p>
      <p><a href="https://allhiphop.com/rumors/murder-rap-director-to-hip-hop-i-spent-countless-hours-fact-checking-ba94OBZ8GEq4xqvcBOdh0A/">Kading's evidence also led the making of the documentary "Murder Rap: Inside the Biggie and Tupac Murders,"</a> as well as the USA Network/Netflix scripted series "Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G." with filmmaker Mike Dorsey.</p>
      <p>“I have to believe that if someone confessed this many times regarding any other murder case in Las Vegas, that case would be closed before the day was over. But for some reason when it comes to Tupac, it’s like the justice system doesn’t fully apply to him,” Dorsey said. "I’m not saying that anyone needs to be arrested – that’s for others to decide,” Dorsey added. “But there’s no reason to go on pretending that we don’t know what happened to Tupac.”</p>
