      <h1>'Must have an issue' - The Derby County verdict that has got fans talking</h1>
      <h2>Derby County latest | Was that the best performance of the season? We asked you for your thoughts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach</a></address>
      <p>Derby County's Saturday win over Preston was hailed as one of their best displays of the campaign by EFL on Quest pundit former Chelsea midfielder Sam Parkin.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county?%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%2F">Rams</a> bounced back from their defeat to Nottingham Forest last time out with a controlled showing, substitute Martyn Waghorn netting the only goal of the game 33 minutes in when he diverted home Curtis Davies' header.</p>
      <p>In truth Derby should have had more goals, with Duane Holmes hitting the cross-bar, Tom Lawrence going close with a scissor-kick and Waghorn <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/loyalty-full-transcript-phillip-cocu-3572104">spurning two opportunities you would back him to score</a> .</p>
      <p>Was that the best performance of the season? We asked you for your thoughts.</p>
      <p><b>David von Brockdoff:</b> Lets not jump the gun, one excellent first half, second we were protecting the lead very effectively, but we need to give him more time. A couple more players from the academy need to step up to provide back up and competitiveness within the first team!</p>
      <p><b>Hans Olav Fjeldstad:</b> If the team can copy a great performance week after week, so yes. Too early to judge with only one excellent half. Stability is not what we have seen much of so far this season. New players in the central line is needed.</p>
      <p><b>Andrew Corner:</b> A top 10 finish is realistic. Top 6 would be a big bonus. 3 or 4 needed in January. And a couple out hopefully. Obviously Marriott is an issue, as 2 manager's now don't seem to play him much. So he must have an issue somewhere.</p>

      <p><b>William Levers:</b> He needs time. His team selections and substitutions sometimes baffle but let him get on we it.</p>
      <p><b>Anthony Jackson:</b> Amazing. Imagine giving a manager more than five minutes to implement his methods and showing signs of improvement and reaping the benefits?! It’s almost as if patience and building solid foundations are the key to progression?!</p>
      <p><b>Jason Palmer:</b> First half yesterday was as good as we've played all season, 5 home wins on the bounce! Any team would be happy with that, if we can start picking up points away anything is possible.</p>
      <p><b>Andy John:</b> Hope improvements in a few additions in Jan will happen.</p>
      <p><b>Steve Garside:</b> Anywhere inside the top ten of the table is a normal position to be in, so we are nearly there now.</p>
