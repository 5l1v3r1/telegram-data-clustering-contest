        <b>Generations The Legacy cancelled? goes off air with immediate effect</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fans of one of Mzansi’s popular soapie, Generations The Legacy have been left fuming after news broke out that the popular TV show will be going off for a full month effective Monday 25 November 2019. Generations: The Legacy, which airs in SABC 1 weekdays from 8 pm, started after 16 cast members from the “original” Generations got fired. The cast members had gone on an unofficial strike.</p>
      <p>All is not gloom and doom though as he soapie directors indicated that from 25 November 2019, they will be airing selected special episodes from the old Generations. Each week the soapie will play episodes remembering our heroes: Archie Moroka, Kenneth Mashaba, Julia Motene, Glen Majozi, Lorraine Dlomo, Mawande, Karabo Moroka Ma Sebobe, Queen Moroka, Sonny, Kenny and his Dinny, among others.</p>

      <p>However, some critics have argued that the sudden break could be another salary dispute saga as the SABC has been in the news recently facing financial problems.</p>
      <aside>BREAKING. @Gen_legacy Generations on @Official_SABC1 is going on an abruptly announced month-long break for reasons the SANC doesn’t explain, with the Morula Pictures produced soap switching to repeats from Monday in prime time. Is this another show the SABC also can’t pay?</aside>

      <aside>The statement reads, in part: “The SABC’s popular soapie, Generations: The Legacy is taking a month-long break. Starting from Monday, 25 November 2019 the soapie will go down memory lane by screening selected iconic episodes of Mzanzi’s most loved soapie, Generations in celebration of its indomitable records, reminiscing on talent who went on to become household names and storytelling spanning 28 years”.</aside>
      <p>It, therefore, remains to be seen if Generations the legacy will return to our screens come Christmas day. Another tweeter account also tweeted :</p>
