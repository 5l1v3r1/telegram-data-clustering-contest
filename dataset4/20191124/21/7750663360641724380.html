      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lokomotiv-moscow/"><b>Lokomotiv Moscow</b></a> take on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayer-leverkusen/"><b>Bayer Leverkusen</b></a> on Tuesday night with both teams sitting on three points in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/">Group D</a>.</h2>

      <p>For either team to progress through to the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> knockout stages, they will likely be required to win their remaining two fixtures.</p>

      <p>When Lokomotiv recorded a 2-1 victory over Leverkusen in Germany on Matchday One, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yuri-semin/"><b>Yuri Semin</b></a> would have felt that his side had given themselves an opportunity to earn a place in the last 16 after Christmas.</p>
      <p>However, while three defeats in a row against Atletico Madrid and Juventus have not exactly come as a surprise, pushing their opponents in each outing with no reward will have hurt Semin and his squad.</p>
      <p>Juve have required late goals to get the better of Lokomotiv both home and away, with their triumph in Moscow coming courtesy of a 93rd-minute winner from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/douglas-costa/"><b>Douglas Costa</b></a>.</p>
      <p>That strike from the Brazilian is currently the difference between third and fourth spot for Lokomotiv, placing them under increased pressure ahead of this contest.</p>
      <p>On a positive note, Friday's 3-2 success over Tambov ended a run of five matches in all competitions without a win, while also keeping the club within five points of top-flight leaders Zenit St Petersburg.</p>
      <p>Despite Leverkusen having endured a below-par campaign on both fronts, maximum points in Russia's capital may be enough to secure a place in the last 32 of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Despite that being their minimum requirement before the start of Group D, their participation in that competition would be regarded as a significant boost with the club currently down in ninth position in the Bundesliga table.</p>
      <p>Leverkusen have performed better since the end of October, however, with their only defeat in six fixtures coming at home to German top-flight frontrunners Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>The 2-1 success over Atletico is also fresh in their memory, and boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/peter-bosz/"><b>Peter Bosz</b></a> will be confident that his developing side can maintain their recent form in what could be a pivotal game for the rest of their season.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kai-havertz/"><b>Kai Havertz</b></a> is unlikely to return from injury in time for the trip to Moscow, and the German playmaker has been joined on the sidelines by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mitchell-weiser/"><b>Mitchell Weiser</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, Bosz will be able to call upon <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leon-bailey/"><b>Leon Bailey</b></a>, who missed out at the weekend due to a domestic suspension.</p>
      <p>Semin could make minimal changes to his Moscow XI, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/solomon-kverkvelia/"><b>Solomon Kverkvelia</b></a> is an option in place of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vedran-corluka/"><b>Vedran Corluka</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joao-mario/"><b>Joao Mario</b></a> will continue to be assessed after being forced to withdraw from international duty with Portugal, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fedor-smolov/"><b>Fedor Smolov</b></a> is in contention to feature after sitting out the last game.</p>
      <p><b>Lokomotiv Moscow possible starting lineup:</b> Guilherme; Howedes, Murilo, Corluka, Rybus; Barinov, Kolomeytsev, Krychowiak; Al.Miranchuk, Eder, An Miranchuk</p>
      <p><b>Bayer Leverkusen possible starting lineup:</b> Hradecky; L.Bender, Tah, Bender, Wendell; Aranguiz, Demirbay; Bailey, Amiri, Diaby; Volland</p>

      <h3>We say: Lokomotiv Moscow 1-2 Bayer Leverkusen</h3>
      <p>Both teams will feel that they gave good account of themselves on Matchday Four, suggesting that they are in good form ahead of this contest. While Lokomotiv have home advantage, we are backing Leverkusen to build on their success over Atletico.</p>
