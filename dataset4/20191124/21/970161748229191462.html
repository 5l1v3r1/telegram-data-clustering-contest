      <p>Logan Paul isn’t letting his recent boxing match defeat at the hands of KSI (or his subsequent wish for the result to be appealed) dampen his mood.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the controversial YouTuber put his sporting woes to one side as he was spotted partying at an LA night spot last night.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was kicking back at Hyde nightclub, weeks after the boxing extravaganza on 9 November at the Staples Center.</p>
      <p>Also spotted at the nightspot was I Can’t Feel My Face singer The Weeknd and Kylie Jenner’s ex Tyga.</p>
      <p>Logan’s night out follows comments in a recent video posted to social media that he’s not a ‘sore loser’ since losing the high profile fight.</p>

      <p>Explaining why he was launching an official appeal against the result after being deducted two points (‘the punishment simply did not fit the crime’), Logan said: ‘My team and I have decided to file an official appeal for the fight because we don’t believe the outcome is right.</p>

      <p>‘It just resonates with me to my core. One of my biggest fears about this is being a sore loser and that’s why I made this video a week after the fight.</p>

      <p>‘I really had to check myself and make sure I wasn’t doing this because I was afraid of losing.’</p>
      <p>He went on: ‘Historically I’ve taken big Ls. By no means am I afraid of losing.</p>
