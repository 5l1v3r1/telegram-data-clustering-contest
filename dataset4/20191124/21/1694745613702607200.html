      <p>As a plant-based eater, getting enough protein won't be an issue, as long as you plan ahead. Here are 12 foods you can meal prep at the beginning of the week to make meals and snacks protein-packed and satisfying, which can help you lose weight. Registered dietitian <a href="https://tracynutrition.com/about">Tracy Lockwood Beckerman</a>, MS, RD, CDN, said it's important to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/45622285/image/45898733/Fuel-Yourself-Protein">get enough protein</a> in order to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Get-Lean-Without-Cardio-44886859">build muscle and satiate hunger</a>, and it may even <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Burn-Belly-Fat-Quick-45052048">rev up your metabolism</a>.</p>
      <h3>Tofu</h3>

      <p>There are a few ways you can prep tofu. You can cube it (or crumble it), <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/34429412/image/34437123/How-Marinate">marinate it</a>, and be done. You can chop other veggies like sweet potatoes and red pepper and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Roasted-Tofu-Sweet-Potato-Pepper-1-Pan-Meal-43540555">add your marinated tofu to a glass dish</a> so it's ready to roast later in the week. Or you can bake or saut√© tofu so it's ready to add to salads, soups, and whole grains.</p>
      <p>For a superquick hack, buy <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/45722421/image/45758954/Baked-Tofu?fullsite=1">Trader Joe's Organic Baked Tofu</a>, cube that, and you're done in five minutes!</p>
      <h3>Tempeh</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Just like tofu, you can slice or cube tempeh and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/46083596/image/46088817/Marinate-More-Flavor">marinate it</a> to keep in the fridge to use later (like in this <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Roasted-Tempeh-Sweet-Potato-Pepper-1-Pan-Meal-45366372">one-pan roasted sweet potato dish</a>). Or you can bake it so it's ready to add to sandwiches, avocado toast, wraps, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Mexican-Tempeh-Quinoa-Salad-35360978">whole grains</a>, or salads.</p>
      <h3>Beans</h3>

      <p>If you've never tasted home-cooked beans, they are on a whole other level when compared to canned beans. Aside from their more robust flavor and tender texture, it's also way cheaper to cook dry beans than to buy canned.</p>
      <p>Experiment with different beans each week to keep your meals exciting. Try black, pinto, black-eyed peas, kidney, and navy beans. You can presoak them Saturday night and cook them in a pot Sunday afternoon on medium heat for about an hour or two, or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Cook-Beans-Slow-Cooker-40544658">cook a big batch of beans in a slow cooker</a>, which takes about eight to nine hours.</p>
      <p>Use them all week to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Squash-Sweet-Potato-Carrot-White-Bean-Soup-36020648">make soup</a>, these <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Soup-Freezer-Packs-44008310">freezer soup packs</a>, burritos, or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Buddha-Bowl-Meal-Prep-45452092">Buddha bowls</a>, or freeze smaller portions to use later.</p>
      <h3>Grains</h3>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Cook up a cup or three of whole grains. You may like making quinoa, brown rice, or barley, or you can <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/photo-gallery/46569553/image/46569571/Whole-Grains">cook two grains together</a> that have similar cooking times, like this red quinoa and arborio rice.</p>
      <p>Use cooked whole grains throughout the week to make savory or sweet breakfasts instead of the usual oatmeal, add spoonfuls to wraps and salads, or use for stir-fries or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Trader-Joe-Chickpea-Coconut-Curry-45653984">curry</a> dinners later in the week. You can also <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Freeze-Cooked-Whole-Grains-37229880">freeze smaller portions for later</a>.</p>
      <h3>Lentils</h3>
      <figure>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you don't have time to meal prep dry beans, cook up a big pot of lentils, because it only takes about 20 minutes. Just simmer one cup of dry lentils with two cups of water, and that's it! They add protein and fiber to salads, soups, and whole grains, or try them as an <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Spaghetti-Squash-Lentils-40654750">alternative to ground meat over pasta</a>.</p>
      <h3>Protein Bars</h3>

      <h3>Roasted Chickpeas</h3>

You can <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Buddha-Bowl-Meal-Prep-45452092">make them savory with garlic powder and cumin</a> (these are great in salads, too), go sweet with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Roasted-Honey-Cinnamon-Chickpeas-27908653">maple syrup and cinnamon</a>, or try <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Cocoa-Cinnamon-Sugar-Roasted-Chickpeas-38590415">cocoa cinnamon roasted chickpeas</a>.</p>

      <h3>Protein Overnight Oatmeal</h3>

This <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/high-protein-overnight-steel-cut-oats-recipe-46595152">recipe is made using steel-cut oats</a>, and you can <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/meal-prep-high-protein-overnight-steel-cut-oatmeal-46758142">make all five at once</a>. The steel-cut oats make for a chewy, more substantial bowl, but if you want a softer texture, try these high-protein recipes made with rolled oats:</p>
      <h3>Protein Balls</h3>

        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/WXzoxZvdylwYnZtkRobaZO9LgLg/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/11/18/778/n/1922729/1fc7eb392f7d5656_Protein-balls-on-mat/i/Protein-Balls.jpg"/>

      <p>These protein balls take less than 15 minutes to make, so even if you only have time to meal prep one thing, let this be it. They're great to keep in the fridge to grab a bunch for a quick breakfast or to nosh on before or after a workout. They're so sweet, they'll even pass for dessert. Here are a few recipes to try:</p>
      <h3>Nut Butter</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Of course you can easily buy nut butter at the store, but if you've never made your own, the flavor is miles above and so worth the time it'll take to clean your food processor. This <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/pumpkin-spice-cashew-butter-recipe-46724820">pumpkin spice cashew butter</a> is made with salted roasted cashews from Trader Joe's, but feel free to use any nut or <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Make-Nut-Butter-Home-3111385">mix nuts together</a>. Store your nut butter in a mason jar, and it's a delicious way to get a little extra protein on toast, mixed into oatmeal, or added to smoothies.</p>
