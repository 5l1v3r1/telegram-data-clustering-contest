      <h1>Kim Kardashian Tries The Bowl Cut, Smashes Tim Tams In Uber Eats BTS Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:50:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">By David Adams</a></address>
      <p>We have some pressing thoughts after a new ad for Uber Eats, featuring <b>Kim Kardashian</b> and <b>Magda Szubanski</b>, <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/bites/kim-k-sharon-strzelecki-uber-eats/">hit Australian screens last night.</a> Realistically, how much would it cost to book Kardashian for an afternoon? How many honest-to-God American dollars would she have earned learning to pronounce “noice”? Will her appearance next to one of Australia’s most beloved comic figures actually encourage anyone to splurge on a couple of pad thais and a Coke Zero? Is Kim <i>really</i> here if you need?</p>
      <p>Precisely none of those questions are answered by a new behind-the-scenes video, which features the reality star hamming it up in a <b>Sharon Strzelecki</b>-style bowl cut wig, nibbling 1/16th of a Tim Tam, and wrapping her mouth around “yiros”.</p>
      <p>“I do not take pineapple on pizza, but I’m not opposed to it. I’m just like, in-between,” Kim said, rolling her eyes like someone who just earned more in one afternoon than the 16-year-old kid who makes the pizzas earns in a year.</p>
      <p>The behind-the-scenes clip appears to have been snapped up by News.com.au, meaning you’ll have to<a href="https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/kim-kardashian-teams-up-with-sharon-strzelecki-for-an-uber-eats-campaign/video/aed5a10f9064cbcc142bd4d1671dce70"> click this link</a> to catch Kardashian in a moonboot and neckbrace. <a href="https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/kim-kardashian-teams-up-with-sharon-strzelecki-for-an-uber-eats-campaign/video/aed5a10f9064cbcc142bd4d1671dce70">Have at it.</a></p>
