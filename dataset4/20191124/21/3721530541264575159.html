      <p><i>Frozen 2 </i>was expected to deliver a monster opening weekend, and now it is official: Disney’s sequel to the 2013 smash hit has the biggest opening ever for an animated feature.</p>
      <p>Disney reported a global debut of $350.2 million, led by $127 million from domestic audiences and abetted by another $53 million from China. As <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/article/ed3312452612/?ref_=bo_hm_hp">Box Office Mojo notes,</a> <i>Frozen 2</i>’s open follows one of the worst weekends of the year, in which the top 10 movies combined didn’t pull in $100 million. It also precedes Thanksgiving weekend, one of the biggest movie-going dates on the U.S. calendar, which means even more moolah is on the horizon for Disney.</p>

      <p><i>Frozen 2</i> carries Disney movies past $3 billion, combined, in domestic box office revenue for the year. The company has the top four domestic earners of the year, <i>Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, </i>and <i>Captain </i><i>Marvel</i><i> </i>pulling in from $390 million to $858 million. This is the third year Disney films have grossed more than $3 billion — and its record of $3.09 billion seems sure to fall when <i>Star Wars</i><i>: The </i><i>Rise of</i><i> Skywalker </i>premieres in December.</p>
