        <b>She first shot to fame as a member of K-pop girl group Kara</b>
      </p>
      <p>K-pop singer and actress Goo Hara was found dead at her home in Seoul today (November 24), police have said.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old is best known as a former member of K-Pop group Kara, which she joined in 2008. She also stared in several television programs, including her own reality TV series <i>On &amp; Off</i>, and an idol beauty show called<i> A Style For You</i>.</p>
      <p>Hara’s first solo EP, released in 2015, peaked at number four in the Korean music charts.</p>
      <p>The singer was found dead at about 6pm local time (9am GMT), according to the Gangnam Police Department. The cause of death is still under investigation.</p>
      <p>She appeared at a series of comeback performances last week after being hospitalised in May following an alleged suicide attempt. In a message to fans following the incident, Hara wrote, “I had been in agony over a number of overlapping issues. But from now on, I will steel my heart and try to show up healthy.”</p>
      <p>Over the last year her career was overshadowed by events in her personal life. In September 2018, Hara filed a lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, after he threatened to expose a sex tape of her without her consent. He was later convicted of threatening, coercing, injuring, and was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.</p>
      <p>Hara’s death comes just over a month since another former K-Pop girl band member, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/south-korean-singer-actor-sulli-dead-25-2556808">Sulli, whose real name is Choi Jin-ri, was found dead at the age of 25.</a></p>
      <p>The K-pop star was found unresponsive by her manager on October 14, on the second floor of her house in the South Korean city of Seongnam.</p>
