      <h1>Rafael Nadal helps Spain clinch first Davis Cup title since 2011 while Great Britain reflect on semi-final loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:21:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/simon-briggs/" target="_blank">Simon Briggs</a></address>
      <p>At around 12.30am on Saturday night, Rafael Nadal sprinted forward and – stretching out his racket arm as if he were Superman taking flight – lifted a short ball over Jamie Murray’s head and on to the line.</p>
      <p>Nadal’s breathtaking display of motor control <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2019/11/24/rafael-nadal-almost-single-handedly-ends-great-britains-run/">effectively clinched Spain’s semi-final victory over Great Britain.</a>They followed up by routing Canada, so lifting the first Davis Cup since the event transmogrified into a week-long festival of tennis.</p>
      <p>We will return to Nadal later, but for Great Britain it was a rough way to go out. Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski never dropped their serve in the decisive doubles rubber – but still found themselves on the wrong end of a 7-6, 7-6 cliffhanger.</p>
      <p>“That one will hurt for a little while, I think,” said a reflective Murray in the interview room at Madrid’s Caja Magica. “But it’s a match I’ll remember when I finish my career, for sure.”</p>
      <p>The new format meant that Great Britain’s whole campaign unfolded with the headlong momentum of the Cresta Run. Team captain Leon Smith looked almost dazed on Saturday night as he told reporters: “It’s been extremely intense playing back-to-back days.”</p>

      <p>At 11am on Tuesday, Andy Murray had opened Great Britain’s campaign against Holland’s world No 179 Tallon Griekspoor. At that stage, everyone was expecting the younger Murray to be Smith’s trump card. Especially as his relatively lowly ranking (he is still only No 126 himself, after missing most of the year with hip trouble) meant he would be in the No 2 position.</p>
      <p>But as Murray laboured for three hours to edge past Griekspoor, it became clear that he was not physically ready for top-level tennis.</p>
      <p>He had spent most of the past month attending to his new baby son, and – by his own account – eating cake and chocolate biscuits. Which is why he then stepped back to a role as a highly stressed cheerleader, contorting his body into anguished positions at the side of the court.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, Great Britain still won all four of their No 2 singles rubbers – but Smith’s trump card was Kyle Edmund instead. </p>
      <p>Having endured a miserable year, full of physical pain and self-doubt, Edmund was a revelation here, rediscovering the same apex-predator vibe that had earned him a place in last year’s Australian Open semi-final. With any luck, the experience will reboot his career in the same way that Fed Cup victory over Kazakhstan invigorated Johanna Konta.</p>
      <p>The upbeat spirit within the British camp was infectious. Skupski showed remarkable composure on his Davis Cup debut, while Dan Evans bounced back superbly from two agonising defeats. His exuberant celebrations on Friday, after he had sealed the quarter-final win over Germany by edging past the hulking Jan-Lennard Struff, provided the most heart-warming moment of the week.</p>

      <p>Clearly, the players still care about the Davis Cup, even in its new incarnation, and not just because of the $18 million (£14million) that is being shared out between them in prize money. </p>
      <p>It is too early to say, however, whether this is a brave new world or a catastrophic mis-step.</p>
      <p>On the upside, two of the so-called Big Three showed up and gave their all, which made a big difference. But the financial model still seems baffling.</p>
      <p>At best, the week may have performed in line with the Masters event here in May, which earns perhaps $40-50 million from broadcasting, sponsorship, ticket sales and city guarantees. Yet Kosmos has bid $3 billion over 25 years for this event – $120 million a year, which is more like grand-slam money.</p>
      <p>There were many hitches – notably the excessively late finishes (Belgium’s match against the United States ran till 4.04am), the empty seats that bedevilled so many ties, and the amusingly hopeless iPhone app. But one thing that went very right was Spain’s success, and especially Nadal’s flawless 8-0 record over the week.</p>
      <p>As Smith pointed out, the passionate home supporters gave Spain a major advantage – and one which they will retain next season. The Caja Magica resounded last night to roars for Nadal and his singles back-up man, Roberto Bautista Agut, whose father had passed away three days earlier, and who broke down in tears after beating Felix Auger-Aliassime in the opening rubber.</p>
      <p>The first self-styled “World Cup of Tennis” thus reached a resonant and emotional finale. Skupski and Jamie Murray must still be cursing Nadal’s impossible winner, but for the future health of the Davis Cup, it was probably the right result.</p>
