      <p>WWE has chosen to add even more to an already stacked card.</p>
      <p>It has been a big weekend for <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> already, but there is still so much more to come with <i>Survivor Series</i> on Sunday night. There is already a very stacked card for the pay-per-view which will have all three main roster brands battling for supremacy, but now, there is even more. A couple of new matches were added to the card late on Sunday afternoon, and one of them is a huge tri-brand battle royal happening on the Kickoff Show.</p>
      <p>This is one of the events that fans have been waiting for as it is the first year that <i>NXT</i> is taking part in <i>Survivor Series</i>. The best of the yellow brand will face off against the best from <i>Monday Night Raw</i> and <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i> to determine who can stand tall above all others in WWE.</p>
      <p>There are titles up for grabs and other matches pitting some of the top superstars from each brand against one another, but WWE wanted to give more. The official website of <a href="https://www.wwe.com/shows/survivor-series/2019/woman-survivor-series-elimination-triple-threat-match"><i>WWE</i></a> reported that there will be a huge battle royal taking place on the Kickoff Show with superstars from all three brands.</p>
      <p>It’s not exactly clear who will be involved in the battle royal, and <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-survivor-series-kickoff-to-feature-a-battle-royal-and-662640/"><i>Wrestling Inc.</i></a> is even reporting that it is just a match “of some kind.” With the Kickoff Show beginning a couple of hours before the actual event, there could be a couple of battle royals if WWE wanted to have them.</p>

      <p>Two other matches are also scheduled for the Kickoff Show, and one is brand new with a few high-flying superstars going into battle. WWE <i>NXT</i> Cruiserweight Champion Lio Rush is going to step into the ring to face off against Kalisto and Akira Tozawa.</p>

      <p>WWE has also announced that one of the matches already announced will take place on the Kickoff Show tonight. <i>Raw</i> Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders will take on <i>SmackDown</i> Tag Team Champions The New Day and <i>NXT</i> Tag Team Champions The Undisputed Era in a non-title match.</p>
