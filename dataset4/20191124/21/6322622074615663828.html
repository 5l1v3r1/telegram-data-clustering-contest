      <h1>Musk Touts 187,000 Cybertruck Orders Just Two Days After Reveal</h1>

      <p>(Nov 25): Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said orders for its Cybertruck have climbed to 187,000 even after two windows unexpectedly shattered in Thursday’s big reveal.</p>
      <p>The electric-car maker has a history of unveiling future products to throngs of excited customers, taking deposits, and then delivering years later. Two years ago, Tesla showed off a Semi truck and a next generation Roadster sports car, but neither vehicle is in production yet. This spring, Musk unveiled the Model Y crossover; that vehicle is slated to begin production next summer.</p>
      <p>The orders, an increase from a 146,000 figure that Musk announced in a Tweet on Saturday, underscores the hard-to-resist nature of announcing deposits, even when they are fully refundable and may never be converted into actual sales.</p>
      <p>187k<br/>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2019</p>
      <p>Tesla’s reservation list has long been a source of intrigue for investors, analysts, journalists, fans and skeptics of the company, as it’s often used as a proxy for demand. Musk’s tweet breaks with the recent practice at Tesla, which has stopped giving reservation figures on its quarterly earnings calls, saying the metric wasn’t relevant.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to comment on the granularity of deposits -- again, people just read too much into those,” Musk said on Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, when asked about the Model Y.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s website allows customers to order the truck for a fully refundable $100, and says they can complete their configuration “as production nears in late 2021.” Musk said in a tweet Saturday that 42% had ordered the dual-motor option, which starts at $49,900, while 41% have ordered the $69,900 triple-motor option, production of which is expected to begin in late 2022. Just 17% ordered the single-motor version, which begins at $39,900.</p>
      <p>146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor<br/>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 23, 2019</p>
      <p>The $100 deposit for the Cybertruck is far cheaper than the $1,000 that was required to reserve a Model 3 sedan.</p>
      <p>“Reservations are not relevant for us,” former Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said in January, during the company’s 2018 fourth-quarter earnings call. “Now we do have a large reservations backlog still, which tells us that a lot of customers are still waiting for those cars. But I don’t think it’s appropriate to share the reservations number.”</p>
      <p>Tesla never released an order or reservation figure for the Model Y. The company had $665 million in customer deposits as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>In a demonstration of the truck’s toughness, long-time Tesla lead designer Franz von Holzhausen whacked the Cybertruck’s stainless steel door with a mallet, showing that it couldn’t be dented. But when he threw a metallic ball at the driver side front window, it shattered.<br/><b>‘Too Hard’</b></p>
      <p>The crowd gasped. “Oh my f---ing god,” said Musk. “Maybe that was a little too hard.”</p>
      <p>So von Holzhausen tried a second, softer throw -- this time targeting the truck’s rear window -- only to see that shatter as well.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t immediately clear who supplied the glass or if Tesla made what it called “Armor Glass” completely in-house. Tesla entered the glass technology business back in 2016, and has an internal group known as Tesla Glass.</p>
      <p>Musk said his team threw the same steel ball at the window several times before the event and didn’t even scratch the glass. Late Friday, he tweeted out a short video of von Holzhausen that has been viewed more than 6 million times.</p>
      <p>Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha. pic.twitter.com/eB0o4tlPoz<br/>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 23, 2019</p>
      <p>The angular, futuristic design and the shattering glass generated enormous publicity for Tesla and its truck, but shares tumbled 6.1% to $333.04 Friday, the sharpest decline in almost two months.</p>
