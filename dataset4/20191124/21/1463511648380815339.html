      <p>The Anambra State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps on Sunday confirmed that two pedestrians died in a fatal crash involving a vehicle plying one-way on Awka-Onitsha Road in Anambra.</p>
      <p>The Sector Commander, Andrew Kumapayi, told the News Agency of Nigeria  in Awka that the accident occurred at about 12.37 p.m.</p>
      <p>Kumapayi explained that the driver of a blue Mercedes-Benz truck with registration number: NSH 521 ZF, suspected to be drunk, was plying one-way when he knocked down and killed two passersby.</p>
      <p>“The truck driver, who was suspected to be drunk, hit the pedestrians while plying one-way.</p>
      <p>He said: “Our officials have taken the deceased to the morgue, while the truck has been towed by the police officers from Ogidi to ensure free flow of traffic in the area.”</p>
      <p>The sector commander expressed sadness at the event and called for prosecution of the truck driver.</p>
      <p>Kumapayi advised drivers to drive cautiously and desist from plying one-way as well as avoid drunk driving.</p>
      <p>According to him, thousands of people had died or suffered from physical disabilities due to drunk driving; drivers need to discipline themselves. </p>
