      <h1>Ottawa to argue appeal of tribunal order to compensate First Nations children</h1>
      <h2>Assembly of First Nations estimated that 54,000 children and payment would exceed $2 billion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Federal lawyers will be in court on Monday to argue the government’s appeal of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that ordered Ottawa to pay billions of dollars in compensation to First Nations children and their families.</p>
      <p>The tribunal’s September ruling came shortly before the start of the federal election campaign.</p>
      <p>It ordered the federal government to pay $40,000 for every First Nations child who was inappropriately taken away from their parents after 2006.</p>
      <p>The Assembly of First Nations estimated that 54,000 children and their parents could be eligible for total compensation that could exceed $2 billion.</p>
      <p>The government has said it planned to appeal the damage award because the timing of the election campaign made it impossible to organize compensation by a Dec. 10 deadline.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Justice Department lawyers will ask the Federal Court for a stay of execution of the tribunal’s order during the first of two days of hearings set aside for the case.</p>
