      <p>Chris Martin has said he will probably vote for the Liberal Democrats at the General Election in an interview where he said some people will still think of him as 'just a white man from Devon'.</p>
      <p>The Coldplay star mostly lives in Malibu in California, near to his children Apple and Moses, but he said he still votes in the UK.</p>
      <p>He joked that he would back the "Monster Raving Loonies", before clarifying to Sunday Times' Culture magazine: "I will probably vote Liberal Democrat."</p>
      <p>The music star, 42, also said that he was nervous about the band's new album Everyday Life because it includes a number of political songs, which he feared may come across "a bit" corny.</p>
      <p>He said: "When you reach a point and realise, 'Wow, we are really one big tribe on Earth, and here's what I think about that', some people may still see you as just a white man from Devon.</p>
      <p>"And say, 'F*** off.'"</p>
      <p>He added: "Because right now there is so much isolationism, and I don't believe in that, at all.</p>
      <p>"In fact, I want to love everyone, yet so much of what I think about life sounds weird when I say it out loud. But I'm OK singing it."</p>

      <p> On his fears of coming across as corny, he said: "You know what, this is making me worry.</p>
      <p>"And the whole attitude of the band now is to say, 'F*** it - just do it.' Which is very freeing, as long as you don't read YouTube comments."</p>
      <p>Martin said that he believes "all the weirdness at the moment is a reaction against the freedom of expression that has happened".</p>
      <p>He said: "No one is wrong. It is just a question of when people engage. Like with climate crisis."</p>
      <p>Everyday Live, a double album, is Coldplay's eighth studio album and features songs inspired by news reports about an Afghan gardener and a Nigerian hymn composer. However, unlike with their previous releases, they will not launch a globe-trotting tour because of environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>The band are in Jordan to perform two shows which will be streamed live on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Martin told BBC News earlier this week: "We're taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial."</p>
      <p>He said of any future tour: "We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral. "We've done a lot of big tours at this point.</p>
      <p>"How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?" The band's last big tour was for A Head Full Of Dreams, in 2016 and 2017.</p>
