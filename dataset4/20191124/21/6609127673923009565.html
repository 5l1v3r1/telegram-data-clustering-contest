        <b>A WIDOW has hit out at crematorium bosses who removed her late hubby’s pic from a memorial plaque.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grieving Mary Webb, 63, was stunned when told the memento of her beloved Graham was among scores ripped off to allow the stone to be cleaned.</p>

      <p>And she says she was “disgusted” when officials revealed she’d have to rake through photos of dead strangers to find it again.</p>
      <p>The ordeal came a year after the retired chef died of lung cancer aged 67 and was laid to rest at Woodside cremmy in Paisley.</p>
      <p>Mary, of the town, had placed a pic from their engagement party 41 years ago on to a tribute message on a wall in the site’s memorial garden.</p>
      <p>She explained: “Recently a friend who was at a funeral there told me Graham’s photograph was gone. I rushed over and it was away.</p>

      <p>“I was told it was for cleaning but they’ve not been returned.</p>
      <p>"I phoned them and they said I could trawl through all the pictures they’d taken.</p>
      <p>“They are families’ personal memories, so nobody has any right to go through them.</p>
      <p>“I was also told it would cost £50 to put up a pic on the wall. I was utterly disgusted.</p>

      <p>“Now I have nowhere to grieve my husband. I just want to kiss his photo and say goodnight.”</p>
      <p>Funeral directors Fosters, who took over the centre in June, charge £199 for a 4in x 10in plaque.</p>
      <p>Signs warn “personal tributes” will be removed.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “It was never our intention to cause any upset.</p>
      <p>“We’re putting in a new records system to allow staff to locate any such items for families in future.”</p>
