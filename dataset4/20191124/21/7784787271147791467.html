      <h1>No handshake, no eye contact: A-League’s all-time scorer Besart Berisha fumes after bizarre substitution</h1>

      <h3>Taking off the A-League’s all-time leading scorer when you’re team is in desperate need of a goal seems like a very bizarre decision to make.</h3>
      <p>Besart Berisha looked visibly upset and frustrated after being substituted by head coach Mark Rudan with his side trailing the Central Coast Mariners.</p>
      <p>Chasing the game, Western United’s star striker was taken off just after the hour mark after missing multiple chances — opportunities a player of his calibre should be burying.</p>

      <p>With his side needing a goal to level things up, it seemed only a matter of time before prolific sharp shooter Berisha would find the back of the net for the A-League newcomers.</p>
      <p>But just as the 34-year-old was getting into his threatening stride, Western United boss Rudan had decided he’d seen enough.</p>

      <p>Berisha looked bemused as the fourth official’s board went up confirming the substitution and slowly made his way towards the bench while unravelling the tape on his wrists.</p>
      <p>Looking not best pleased with his manager’s questionable decision, the former Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory marksman stormed towards the dugout — avoiding an embrace or hand shake with Rudan.</p>
      <p>Berisha is the A-League’s all-time leading goalscorer with 116 goals.</p>
