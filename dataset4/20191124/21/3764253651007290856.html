      </p>
      <p>In the suit, the APC member is asking for the removal of section 137(1) (b) and 182 (1) (b) in the 1999 constitution from the country’s law.</p>
      <p>He added that such clauses were an impediment on the fundamental human right of the president and state governors.</p>
      <p>He added that the present two-term tenure is discriminatory. Defendants in the suit are clerk of the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, the National Assembly and the AGF.</p>
