      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish police intercepted a submarine that appeared to be transporting drugs in waters off the northwestern region of Galicia on Sunday, a source with the central government’s delegation to the region told Reuters.</p>
      <p>“Early this morning an international operation was able to locate a small submarine of around 20 meters near the beach of Hio in the province of Pontevedra,” the source said, confirming earlier media reports.</p>
      <p>News agency EFE reported that the vessel was carrying some 3,000 kilograms of cocaine, citing sources from Spain’s Guardia Civil.</p>
      <p>However, the source told Reuters that while the submarine appeared to be carrying drugs it had not yet been confirmed and a spokeswoman for the Guardia Civil said she could not confirm the submarine’s cargo as it was still under water.</p>
      <p>Two South-American men were detained as part of the operation, in which the Guardia Civil and National Police participated, while a third man escaped, the source said.</p>
      <p>Authorities will attempt to refloat the vessel on Monday morning after attempts on Sunday proved unsuccessful.</p>
