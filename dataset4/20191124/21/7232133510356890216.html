      <p>Bitcoin’s recent turbulence has spilled over into the aggregated crypto markets, leading most major cryptocurrencies to form a close correlation with its price action – which has proven to be highly bearish for Ethereum (ETH) and other major altcoins.</p>
      <p>In spite of this near-term bearishness, analysts are noting that Ethereum may be attempting to form a long-term bottom against its BTC trading pair, which could mean that it will begin finding some upwards momentum in the near-term.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Plummets Towards $140 Amidst Early-Morning Sell-Off</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/08/23/33-cent-ethereum-and-100-eos-whats-going-on-at-one-crypto-exchange/">Ethereum</a> is trading down over 4% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $146.00, which marks a massive sell-off from its weekly highs of nearly $180.</p>
      <p>Ethereum’s bearishness in recent times came about after it attempted to break above $190 on multiple occasions, which ultimately proved to be futile and helped perpetuate its downwards momentum.</p>
      <p>This bearish momentum was further perpetuated by Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/23/bitcoins-local-bottom-found-6800-analysts-assert/">recent downtrend</a>, which began when it failed to find enough buying pressure to maintain the upwards momentum that sent it from lows of $7,300 to highs of $10,600.</p>
      <p>ETH has been able to find strong support at $144 over the past 24-hours, which may signal that this is a near-term support level that will help bolster its near-term price action.</p>
      <p>The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that she believes Ethereum may drop to the $120 region before it finds enough support to begin climbing higher.</p>
      <blockquote>“$ETH Descending triangle is completed! This pennant typically breaks down as displayed. I think we could see $126-$130 region,” she explained in a recent tweet.</blockquote>

      <h3>Is ETH Attempting to Form a Bottom Against BTC?</h3>
      <p>Jonny Moe, another prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he believes ETH is currently showing some signs of forming a mid-term bottom against its Bitcoin trading pair, in spite of The Cryptomist’s bearish assessment of the cryptocurrency.</p>
      <blockquote>“Possible bottoming attempt on $ETH on the $ETHBTC pair. Interested to see how this plays out,” he explained while pointing to the chart seen within the below tweet.</blockquote>

      <p>It is probable that Bitcoin’s near-term price action will have an impact on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/17/analyst-anticipates-imminent-upside-break-for-ethereum/">Ethereum’s price action</a>, as any massive downwards movement will likely lead ETH and other major altcoins to concurrently plummet lower.</p>
