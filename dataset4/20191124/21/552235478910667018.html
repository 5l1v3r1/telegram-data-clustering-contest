      <h1>Michael Stewart shoots down lofty Celtic claim as pundit takes exception to glowing review</h1>
      <h2>Gary Holt had some major praise but his remarks on the Hoops' four goals against Livingston left Stewart puzzled.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:03:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Michael Stewart has queried <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Gary Holt</a> 's claim that Celtic are "world class" after the Livingston boss extolled the virtues of the Premiership champions in the wake of his side's 4-0 Premiership defeat.</p>
      <p>Livi were unbeaten in three against the Hoops going into the game but they were overmatched from the first minute to last during the Parkhead drubbing on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And Holt waxed lyrical about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's side in his post-match interview after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> , Scott Brown and James Forrest's double put his side to the sword.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old said: "If the goals are world class goals, and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> are a world class team, they really are, they have a lot of pace and movement but we never got cut open, we nullified their threats.</p>

      <p>"The goals are horrible, there's no great play or someone has smashed it from 20 yards into the top corner. It's individual mistakes we need to look at."</p>
      <p>But Stewart was less than convinced, however, and reckons there was nothing ugly about Edouard's opener.</p>
      <p>He remarked on Sportsound: "It's a nice, horrible goal this isn't it?"</p>
      <p>And the former Hearts and Hibs midfielder also had reservations over Holt's hefty praise in the direction of the Premiership champions.</p>

      <p>He added: "Look, there were a couple of things there that were a wee bit over the top. The Celtic goals weren't horrible.</p>
      <p>"I don't think Celtic are world class, they are certainly the top team in the country and they are doing very well in Europe but world class? Perhaps that is a step too far."</p>
      <p>Celtic supporters have enjoyed a thrill ride so far this season with their side top of the table and set for a showdown with title rivals Rangers in next month's Betfred Cup Final.</p>
      <p>The Hoops are also flying high on the continent with Olivier Ntcham's winner against Lazio sealing a place in the last 32 of the Europa League with two games to spare.</p>
