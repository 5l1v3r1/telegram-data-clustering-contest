      <h1>Israel Adesanya responds to Yoel Romero: ‘I see you soon boi’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>With top-ranked UFC middleweight Paulo Costa out of action for the foreseeable future, the UFC is scrambling to find a new opponent for Israel Adesanya’s first title defense.</p>
      <p>UFC president Dana White is opposed to the idea of Yoel Romero stepping up and challenging Adesanya for the title, but ‘The Last Stylebender’ and ‘Soldier of God’ both seem interested in the matchup.</p>
      <p>Both men have gone back-and-forth on social media for the past few weeks with the sole intention of changing White’s mind and convincing the UFC to book the fight.</p>
      <p>In the latest round of tweets, Adesanya responded to Romero with a Guardians of the Galaxy, I am Groot reference, mocking the Cuban’s signature line, ‘I see you soon boi’.</p>

      <p>Adesanya, a former kickboxing champion, unified the middleweight titles last month with a second-round knockout of Robert Whittaker. The Nigerian-New Zealander is expected to return to the Octagon to defend his title in the new year.</p>
