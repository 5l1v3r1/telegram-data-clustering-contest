      <p>Olaleye Aluko, Abuja</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari will on Thursday confer the National Productivity Order of Merit award on the Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Col Hameed Ali (retd.), Alhaji Aliko Dangote and other notable Nigerians.</p>
      <p>The award is said to be instituted by the Federal Government to recognise “hard work and excellence among deserving Nigerians.”</p>
      <p>According to JAMB on Sunday, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, confirmed the nominations for the award in a letter to the registrar.</p>
      <p>The board added that an award lecture titled, “Productivity for National Re-Engineering, Security and Growth” would be delivered by a former Director-General of the National Centre for Education Management and Administration, Prof Mike Obadan.</p>
      <p>According to the JAMB bulletin on Sunday, a copy of the letter reads, “The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has approved the conferment of the National Productivity Order of Merit Award on you in recognition of your high productivity, hard work and excellence.”</p>
      <p>“Other awardees are the CG of Customs, Col Hameed Ali (retd.), Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Mr Tony Elumelu and others.”</p>
      <p>The bulletin added, “The JAMB registrar was nominated for the National Productivity Order of Merit Award. His innovations and the deployment of Information and Communications Technology in the fight against corruption and other unwholesome acts have given impetus to the fight against financial, administrative and examination malfeasance.</p>
      <p>“The disclosure of the board’s income and expenditure weekly in the bulletin has not gone unnoticed by anti-corruption crusaders.”</p>
