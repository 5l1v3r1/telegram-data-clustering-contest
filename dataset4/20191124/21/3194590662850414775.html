        <b>Is egg for kids good on a daily basis? As a mum of a little egg lover, I’ve always wondered if my seven-year-old’s love for eggs might not be so good for his <a href="https://www.africaparent.com/what-to-eat-during-pregnancy-to-have-a-beautiful-baby">health</a> in the long run.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is why I researched on the matter and wrote <b><a href="https://sg-admin.theasianparent.com/are-eggs-good-for-kids/">this article</a></b> about egg for kids, a few years ago. In essence, an egg a day is just fine for your child.</p>
      <p>But very recent research now claims en egg a day is more than just fine<b>.</b> Egg for kids can actually help them grow taller and bigger.</p>
      <p>The study</p>
      <p>The study, “Eggs in Complementary Feeding and Growth,” was published online June 6 in the journal <b><a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/06/05/peds.2016-3459">Pediatrics</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Lora Iannotti, lead author of the study, is also a leading expert on child nutrition at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Iannotti and her team conducted a randomized, controlled trial in Ecuador. In the study, 160 babies aged six to nine months were give a egg daily, for six months. They also received less sugar-sweetened food. A control group with kids the same age did not receive a daily egg.</p>
      <p>The research team monitored the youngsters for any problems, such as allergic reaction to eggs. They also made sure the families were following the research plan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The results</b>
      </p>
      <p>In some pretty amazing results, the research showed that eggs significantly increased length-for-age and weight-for-age scores in the group of kids who ate them.</p>
      <p>In fact, eggs increased growth and reduced stunting by an incredible 47 percent.</p>
      <p>“We were surprised by just how effective this intervention proved to be,” Iannotti said. “The size of the effect was 0.63 compared to the 0.39 global average.”</p>
      <p>Egg for kids: Importance of good nutrition</p>
      <p>Given that the first two years of a child’s life are crucial for their growth and development (stunting within this age range is irreversible), the result of this study are certainly valuable.</p>
      <p>Eggs are cheap, tasty and they are essential in a large range of recipes. And even if a young child going through a fussy phase were only to eat an egg for one meal, this would still give him a good range of nutrients such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Choline:</b> for brain development, function and memory;</li>
        <li><b>Folate:</b> produces and maintains red blood cells;</li>
        <li><b>Iron:</b> carries oxygen to the cells;</li>
        <li><b>Lutein and Zeaxanthin:</b> maintain good vision and protect the eyes against harmful UV rays;</li>
        <li><b>Niacin:</b> promotes normal nerve function and helps release energy;</li>
        <li><b>Omega-3 fats:</b> improve blood cholesterol;</li>
        <li><b>Protein:</b> helps keep body strong;</li>
        <li><b>Vitamin A:</b> protects against cancers;</li>
        <li><b>Vitamin B12:</b> protects against heart disease;</li>
        <li><b>Riboflavin:</b> helps keep body tissues healthy;</li>
        <li><b>Vitamin D:</b> keeps bones and teeth healthy;</li>
        <li><b>Vitamin E:</b> acts as an antioxidant;</li>
        <li><b>Zinc:</b> promotes a strong immune system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Having said this, it’s important to remember that little ones need a balanced diet and adding an egg as a complementary food to a well-rounded diet can certainly benefit a child in many ways.</p>
      <p>The British Nutrition Foundation advises: “While eggs are a nutritious food to include, it’s very important that young children have a variety of foods in their diets. Not only is this necessary to get all the vitamins and minerals they need, but also to allow them to become familiar with a wide range of tastes and textures.</p>
      <p>“A range of protein-rich foods should be provided when feeding young children, which can include eggs but can also feature beans, pulses, fish, especially oily fish, meat and dairy products.”</p>
      <p>If you are concerned about egg allergies<b>, </b>monitor your child well when you first introduce eggs to his diet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Also keep these eggy hygiene tips in mind:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure to eat fresh eggs with shells intact.</li>
        <li>Wash the outside of the egg shell before you crack it.</li>
        <li>While it is recommended not to give soft-boiled eggs to children, pasteurised eggs  are the better option.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Remember</b>: The expert recommendation is that you wait until your child is six months old before introducing solids.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organisation recommends that until babies start solids, they should be exclusively breastfed.</p>
