      <p>Flamengo have been crowned Brazilian champions for the seventh time in their history and the first time in 10 years - just one day after winning the Copa Libertadores.</p>
      <p>Gremio's win at Palmeiras left Flamengo with an insurmountable 13-point lead at the top of Serie A and Jorge Jesus' side will be able to enjoy their remaining four games of the season with the title secured.</p>
      <p>Two late goals from Gabriel Barbosa earned Flamengo a dramatic 2-1 victory over River Plate in Saturday's Copa Libertadores final and sparked wild celebrations in the streets of Rio.</p>
      <p>The weekend was made even more unforgettable for Flamengo supporters when Pepe scored in second-half stoppage-time to clinch a 2-1 victory for Gremio at Palmeiras, handing the league leaders their first Brasileirao since 2009.</p>
