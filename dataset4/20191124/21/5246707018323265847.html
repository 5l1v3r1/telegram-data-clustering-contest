      <p>The Switch and professional wrestling have become somewhat intertwined of late. Nintendo's console benefitted from the promotional push of the one and only <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/02/john_cena_is_floored_by_the_technology_in_the_nintendo_switch">John Cena</a> at launch, and more recently it has been used to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/random_nintendo_switch_now_so_popular_its_fuelling_wwe_feuds">fuel storylines</a>. Heck, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/random_turns_out_the_switch_really_can_be_played_anytime_anywhere_with_anyone">we've even seen the Switch enter the ring</a>.</p>
      <p>However, as far as actual games go, Switch owners haven't seen an official <b>WWE</b> outing since the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wwe_2k18">2018 entry</a> – which, given the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/10/wwe_2k20_is_an_astoundingly_buggy_mess_on_ps4">sorry state</a> of <b><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/wwe_2k20">WWE 2K20</a></b>, might not be a bad thing. Still, that doesn't mean the system doesn't have its fans within the world-famous organisation – in fact, WWE superstar Seth Rollins has now gone on record to say that he prefers Nintendo's machine to Sony and Microsoft's offerings.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50490801">BBC</a> as part of its Premier League predictions feature – in which celebrities are tasked with guessing the weekend's scores – Rollins mentioned that he liked playing <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_20">FIFA</a></b> on his Switch:</p>
      <blockquote>Am I any good when I play Fifa? Erm, no. I like to think that I am good, but I doubt it. I can play on the Switch OK, but if you get me on the PlayStation or an X-Box, it is foreign to me. Who else plays? Cesaro, Sheamus and Rusev have all played a little bit too. I know they all prefer the PlayStation though and I just don't go there because I get beat. I stick where it is simple and easy on the Switch.</blockquote>
      <p>So there you have it; Rollins has spoken. The console war is over; everybody pack up and go home. Nothing to see here.</p>
      <p>(We'll ignore the bit where he says it's "simple" and "easy" and instead blindly focus on the fact that out of the big three manufacturers, he picked Nintendo. Good lad.)</p>
