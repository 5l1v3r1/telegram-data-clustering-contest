          </p>
          <p>Placed adjacent in the showpiece T20 tournamnet, for Tamil Nadu and Punjab, today’s encounter against each other comes bearing massive ramifications. With both the sides having enduring campaigns reminiscent to each other in Group B with both have tasted the one win and defeat apiece, a win in this tie will see the winners move clear into second place.</p>
          <p>Full points from this affair is also so pivotal for either side giving the speed Karnataka have set at the top of the points tally. The side are sitting undisputed in first place with the three wins from three matches and if either side has to make their aspirations of displacing them intact, anything else than a win could prove to be calamitous for Tamil Nadu and Punjab.</p>

                <p>Tamil Nadu make an advent into today’s encounter having thumped and routed Mumbai by 7 wickets the last time around. It was a complete and clinical display by them, one which saw them comprehensively decimate and dismantle their opponents as they first curbed their opponents for just 121 before cruising to a win inside 14 overs.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, after winning their tournamnet opener, Punjab ended up losing their bygone contest against Karnataka, a match where their bowling unit was cut short and blown apart as Karnataka ripped into them to chase down the 164 run target with 7 wickets and two overs to spare. It was a contentious and callous bowling performance, one they’ll be looking to address and rectify as they look to turnaround an underachieving performance come today’s forthcoming tie. </p>

                            <h3>TN Vs PUN Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Having scored 247 runs in 6 encounters, Dinesh Karthik from Tamil Nadu is roped into our Dream 11 encounter for today’s encounter. The wicket-keeper has scored some good runs and more importantly on a consistent basis to see us op for him for this encounter.</p>
                            <h3>TN Vs PUN Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Anmolpreet Singh has been in tremendous and sensational for Punjab in this edition of the marquee tournamnet, scoring 250 runs in a format where he ended up making his name. On a surface where the ball will rise onto the bat with ease, the player becomes a must have one for this encounter with opner Shubman Gill accompanying him for this encounter with the bat having massed 83 runs in 3 matches.</p>
                            <p>Abhishek Sharma comes in as well to complete the trio of picks from the side for the day whilst form Tamil Nadu we are moving in with Hari Nishanth not only owing to his price tag of 8 credits but the runs he’s doled out for the side on a persistent basis as well.</p>
                            <h3>TN Vs PUN Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>His 273 runs for the side till now make Mandeep Singh he first name to be inducted in this slot of our Dream 11 unit alongside Gurkeerat Singh Mann who has scored 173 runs. Elsewhere from the opposition we have just the one player but someone who holds a key spot in both the facets of their gameplan, something which is emoted by the 146 runs and 4 wickets Vijay Shankar has ended up getting.</p>
                            <h3>TN Vs PUN Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>On a wicket where batting will be an extremely pristine task, Punjab’s Mayank Markande is someone who will lure batsmen into holing out the ball as he tosses the ball in the air and looks to give it immense rotations. Its seen him pick up 10 wickets and we see him leaving Tamil Nadu is disarray as well to make him our singular pick from Punjab.</p>
                            <p>From Tamil Nadu meanwhile we have decided to ingrain M Siddharth and M Mohammed for the day, two bowlers who’ll come on in the death overs when Punjab are looking to lunge out at anything.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Anmolpreet is being made our side’s captain with Gill from the same side coming in as the vice-captain.</p>
