      <p>Fee was one of 600 people specially selected from around the country as part of the Spirit of America dance team.</p>
      <p>"I sent in a video audition and a few weeks later I heard I was accepted, which I was not expecting and so I am just so thrilled and it is an honor to dance," said Fee.</p>
      <p>You can see her dance in person soon, during the Nutcracker at Country Tonite in Pigeon Forge.</p>
