      <p>The gospel group is based out of Clinton, Tennessee and has been sharing God's message of love and hope through their music.</p>
      <p>The group began as 3 sisters, now one of the original sisters, Peg, along with her husband, their daughter, her husband, and their son and daughter perform together. It's been a family group all these years.</p>
      <p>The McKameys performed their last show Saturday night at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium. The family-based gospel group spent six decades of spreadings the message of God through Gospel.</p>
      <p>They have been awarded several Singing News Fan Awards and Peg McKamey Bean was inducted into the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2016.</p>
      <p>In an open letter posted to their webpage, the group announced retirement from full time touring because "we feel this is where God is leading at this time in our lives."</p>
