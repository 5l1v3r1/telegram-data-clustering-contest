      <p>Grime 4 Corbyn have made an unexpected comeback and endorsed Labour for a second consecutive election.</p>
      <p>Following speculation that the musicians’ support for Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/grime4corbyn-mcs-drop-support-labour-leader-11076871/">could be dropped</a> ahead of the December 12 poll, ‘Grime 4 Corbyn 2.0’ has been announced.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/wiley/">Wiley</a>, Nadia Rose and Lethal Bizzle – who had previously called on Mr Corbyn to resign – recently tweeting their support, a new grime event to back the leader of the opposition’s tilt at Downing Street has been announced.</p>
      <p>It follows a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/15/grime4corbyn-campaign-offers-fans-the-chance-to-attend-secret-rave-if-they-vote-for-labour-6639082/">move in 2017 to get young people to register to vote</a>, which was credited with helping Labour win support among young people.</p>
      <p>The announcement also comes on the day <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/jeremy-corbyn-says-people-will-continue-die-streets-tory-manifesto-11210008/">Labour announced a new £1 billion investment plan for the arts</a>.</p>

      <p>The group, which has tweeted that it is endorsing the Labour leader at the election, says on its website that it wants young people to ‘take part in the electoral process [but] vote for who you want.’</p>
      <p>Sharky Major, the founder of Grime Originals and co-founding member of the collective N.A.S.T.Y crew, said: ‘My parents and grandparents have always been in favour of Labour and I’m no different. We are regular hard working people who want the best for people like us.’</p>
      <p>Logan Sama, a key DJ in the scene, added: ‘I am not sure any politician can deliver what they promise, but I know that the Conservatives have delivered years of austerity and cuts that have massively affected the working class whilst the mega rich continue to get acquire obscene personal wealth and corporations continue to take their earnings offshore and not pay back in to our tax system.</p>
      <p>‘I’m ready for change. For the good of the many.’</p>
