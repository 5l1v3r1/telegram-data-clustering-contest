      <h1>Jumbo Interactive shares on watch after acquisition approval</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:54:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p><b>Jumbo Interactive Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Jumbo+Interactive+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-JIN">(ASX: JIN)</a> shares will be worth watching this morning after the company’s recent UK acquisition gained regulatory approval.</p>
      <h3>What’s the background to the acquisition?</h3>
      <p>Jumbo announced on 12 November that it would be acquiring lottery manager Gatherwell Limited for $9.1 million.</p>
      <p>CEO Mike Veverka said the purchase would “accelerate Jumbo’s expansion of the Software as a Service business in the UK.”</p>
      <p>The company is aiming for $1 billion of ticket sales through the Jumbo platform by 2022.</p>
      <p>Jumbo had anticipated a response from the UK Gambling Commission by 31 January 2020, but today received the green light for the purchase.</p>
      <p>The effective date of the acquisition will be 1 December 2019, with an expected 7-month contribution of $8.6 million in ticket sales to the Group’s financial results.</p>
      <p>The latest step is key to Jumbo reaching its $1 billion vision for the Jumbo platform by FY 2022.</p>
      <h3>How has Jumbo performed on the ASX this year?</h3>
      <p>Jumbo shares have climbed an astonishing 186.75% higher since the start of January.</p>
      <p>However, it’s been a difficult November for shareholders as <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/21/the-jumbo-interactive-share-price-is-down-20-this-month-is-it-a-buy/">the company’s shares have slumped 19.05% in the last 30 days</a>.</p>
      <p>The company’s ambitious near-term goals have set the stage for a successful 2019, which has been full of aggressive customer acquisition and strong earnings.</p>
      <p>Jumbo reported record financial results with a 74% year on year (YoY) increase in active customers to 761,863. Revenue rocketed 64% YoY, while net profit and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation surged by 124% and 107%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The group’s SaaS vision has proven to be a hit, while the potential entry into the UK market also boosted investors’ hopes higher.</p>
      <p>Jumbo has a market cap of $1.3 billion and trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 49.4x earnings. Jumbo shares are also netting a tidy 1.74% per annum dividend yield at the moment.</p>
