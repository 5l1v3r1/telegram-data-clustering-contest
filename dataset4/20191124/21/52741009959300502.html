      <p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Authorities are continuing to monitor a fire at North Carolina’s famed Cold Mountain.</p>
      <p>U.S. Forest Service officials said Sunday that a wildfire continues to burn at the iconic mountain despite rain in the area over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The mountain has been featured in a popular novel and an award-winning movie. Charles Frazier’s bestselling book “Cold Mountain” is about a Confederate soldier’s journey through western North Carolina. The book was later adapted into a 2003 movie starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger.</p>
      <p>The forest service didn’t release details on what might have caused the fire or where exactly it began. The Shining Rock Wilderness area is temporarily closed because of the fire.</p>
      <p>The mountain is about 35 miles (55 kilometres) from the city of Asheville.</p>
