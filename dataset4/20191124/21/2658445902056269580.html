      <h4>Tony Akowe, Abuja</h4>
      <p>Worried by the poor state of the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road, the House of Representatives has summoned the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, the Director (Highways) of the Ministry and the contractors handling reconstruction work on the road, Julius Berger plc to brief them on the status of the ongoing works on the road.</p>
      <p>The House also directed Julius Berger to, as a matter of public necessity open already completed section of the Abuja-Kaduna road to motorists to ease vehicular movement and reduce the hardship currently being faced by travellers on the road.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by the Chairman of the House Committee on Works, Rep. Abubakar Kabir Abubakar, and made available to journalists in Abuja on Sunday, the House said the summon has become necessary following barrage of complaints by Nigerians travelling using the road.</p>

      <p>The statement said “The ongoing rehabilitation and dualization of the Abuja-Kaduma highway is causing untold hardship to motorists and other road users plying that road.</p>
      <p>“The partial closure of some sections have caused enormous financial and labour time losses due to road traffic congestion and long hours spent on the road.</p>
      <p>“It has been observed that the quality of life of those commuting on that has started to decline. A journey that normally takes 4 hours now takes at least 9 hours to complete.</p>
      <p>“We call on the construction company working on the road to expedite action on the project so as to complete it on time. They should immediately open up closed sections of the road they have completed to motorists so as to reduce the long hours spent travelling on the road.</p>
      <p>“We also call on relevant authorities such as the Federal Road Safety Corps and the Nigeria police force to provide adequate security and ensure that motorists drive within the maximum speed limit of 50 km per hour as prescribed by the National Raid Traffic Regulations, 2012 as the maximum limit allowed at construction zones.</p>
      <p>“They should ensure that motorists observe lane discipline and avoid driving against traffic”.</p>
