      <p>Damian Brown, 46, was last seen in the Woden area on October 17.</p>
      <p>Mr Brown has been described as Caucasian, about 180 centimetres tall, with short brown hair and a slim build.</p>
      <p>He also has a distinctive skull tattoo on his inner-left forearm.</p>
      <p>While photos released by ACT police show Mr Brown with long hair, an ACT police spokesman said police believe he has cut his hair since the photos were taken.</p>
      <p>Mr Brown's family and police said they held concerns for his welfare and have called for help from the public to help find him.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on Mr Brown's whereabouts has been urged to contact ACT police on 131 444.</p>
