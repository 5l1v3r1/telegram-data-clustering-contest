      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13979/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a> was excited after his first victory as a starter. In fact, he was excited before his first victory as a starter was secured and missed victory formation.</p>
      <p>While the team was running out the clock, the Washington quarterback was taking a photo behind the bench, grabbing the cell phone of a fan to document the moment.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/7696/case-keenum">Case Keenum</a> took the kneel down to end the game.</p>
      <p>Coach Bill Callahan said they couldn’t find Haskins after <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12245/fabian-moreau">Fabian Moreau</a> intercepted <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11340/jeff-driskel">Jeff Driskel</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think he thought the game was over,” Callahan said, via John Keim of ESPN. “I’m happy we won. We’ll address that.”</p>
      <p>Washington kicked a field goal with 16 seconds left to go up 19-16, but Washington got the ball back with two seconds remaining on Moreau’s takeaway.</p>
      <p>Haskins confirmed he thought the game was over, which is why he missed the final snap.</p>
      <p>“I was so hype,” Haskins said, via JP Finlay of NBCSportsWashington.com.</p>
