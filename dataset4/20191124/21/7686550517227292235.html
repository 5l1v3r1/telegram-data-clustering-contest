      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celeb</a> star <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/how-much-caitlyn-jenner-worth-17300738">Caitlyn Jenner</a> confided in her campmates about her transition in Sunday night's show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/how-much-caitlyn-jenner-worth-17300738">Caitlyn</a> spoke candidly to pop star Nadine Coyle and Eastenders actress Jacqueline Jossa as the trio had a heart-to-heart.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said: "Transitioning and trying to make an impact; social media is extraordinarily important.</p>
      <p>"As soon as the cover of Vanity Fair broke, in the next four hours and one minute, it broke the world record for the fastest to one million followers on Twitter.”</p>
      <p>Nadine said that she remembered it and that she recalled where she was on that day. "It’s a big thing," agreed Jacqueline.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, said: "For me this was a big FU to the millions and millions of people out there that had said terrible things about me.</p>
      <p>"And it just came out and it just shocked them."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline praised Caitlyn for how she looked in the picture that took social media by storm in 2015.</p>

      <p>Discussing her surgery, Caitlyn said: "Over many many years I had a lot but then near the end it went pretty quickly because you can do your face and your chest all at the same time which they did.</p>
      <p>"Actually for guys if they go on oestrogen, they will grow boobs.</p>
      <p>"And in my case I was on oestrogen back in the 80s and had a little 36/38B and then I met Kris and had them chopped off.</p>
      <p>"I'm so confused in my life,” she laughed.</p>
      <p>"And then the second time round 25 years later I was back on oestrogen obviously and they came back some but not much.</p>
      <p>"So I really had to have them done so it is kind of past the point of no return.”</p>
      <p>Later Jacqueline added: "I love the fact that she (Caitlyn) talks so openly and she feels like she can trust us and speak to us so openly and she puts everything into perspective as well.</p>
      <p>"Like everybody goes through something. She's like the amount of strength that woman has is amazing."</p>
