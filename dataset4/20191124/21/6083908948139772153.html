      <h1>Giuliani: Joe Biden Already 'Confessed' to Committing 'the Crime of Bribery'</h1>

      <p>President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, gave an exclusive interview to Fox News' Ed Henry about Ukraine, Burisma and the Bidens. During the conversation, Giuliani reminded Henry of one important tidbit: former Vice President Joe Biden already admitted to bribery.</p>
      <p>"It’s simple. The case has been real simple from the day that Joe Biden confessed to committing bribery back in January of 2018 and the counsel on foreign relations didn’t note anything about it, although he said precisely what was attributed to President Trump a year-and-a-half later that caused all sorts of — basically they'll prove he committed the crime of bribery, offering something of value to a public official for official action," the former New York City mayor explained.</p>
      <p>According to Giuliani, Biden offered Burisma a one billion dollar loan guarantee and, in return, the then-President of Ukraine fired the prosecutor who was investigating the Bidens for corruption. It's the "quid pro quo" that the media has continually hurled at President Trump.</p>
      <p>"The council on foreign relations didn’t find anything wrong with that," Giuliani said in reference to Biden's previous bribes. "Although, a year-and-a-half later when the false charge was put out that [Donald Trump] threatened Zelensky with not getting money in order to investigate Biden, within a minute there were headlines in the New York Times, The Washington Post, calls for impeachment."</p>
      <p>Giuliani argued what Biden did is <i>exactly </i>what Democrats have accused Trump of doing: using authority and power to bribe others. The difference is that it's totally acceptable for Democrats to do.</p>
      <p>"It’s the same thing except for the double standard that we have that’s corrupting us," he said.</p>
