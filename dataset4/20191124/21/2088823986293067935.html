      <p>GLENS FALLS – Portville had a lot going right in its first set against Valhalla on Sunday, but it just seemed to awaken a sleeping giant.</p>
      <p>After losing the first set, the Vikings from Section I rallied to win the next three and earn the New York State Public High School Athletic Association title in Class C at Cool Insuring Arena. Game scores were 17-25, 25-22, 25-16 and 25-13.</p>
      <p>Valhalla became the first non-Section VI school to win a Class C state title since Byron-Bergen of Section V in 2006. Portville was the two-time defending state Class C champion.</p>
      <p>“Just good volleyball, I think,” Portville coach Kelly Unverdorben said of Valhalla’s win. “We’re young with a freshman, sophomore and an eighth grader on the court. (Valhalla) is pretty senior-dominant.</p>
      <p>"I had a senior-dominant team last year, I know what that’s like. Sometimes with seniors, they just know they’re not going to let their season end. I don’t know that my team will ever let that happen again, either.”</p>
      <p>With Valhalla leading 4-3 in the first set, Portville scored 13 of the next 15 points and held on for a comfortable win.</p>
      <p>“I think the first set we just came out a little bit too pumped,” Valhalla coach Trish Ward said. “We just needed to relax and play our game, and once we did that, we proved what we could do.”</p>
      <p>Portville rarely held a lead for the rest of the day, the last time being a 5-4 advantage in the second set. Valhalla got out to a 20-10 lead that set before Portville rallied and closed it to 24-22 before the Vikings closed it out.</p>
      <p>Besides Class C tournament MVP Jasmine Grant’s all-out kills – she had 30 in total – the West Point-bound middle hitter scored a fair number of points for the Vikings on soft touches when Portville made sure to try to block her at the net.</p>
      <p>“We all talked about that, and she and Steph (Sicilian), our setter, talked about it, too, really just focusing on finding the holes,” Ward said. “We knew Jasmine was probably going to get triple-blocked today, so there had to be some spots open.”</p>
      <p>“We knew that,” Unverdorben said. “For some odd reason, we just could not get under that ball, and boy, we practice that an awful lot. Some days it’s just not there.”</p>
      <p>Making the all-tournament team for Portville were setter Kylie Blessing (39 assists) and Olivia Cook (11 kills). Olivia Emley added 20 digs, while Laura Wilhelm and Tori Unverdorben had 13 and 10 kills, respectively.</p>
      <p>“It’s OK,” Unverdorben said. “My team played so hard today, I couldn’t be prouder of them.”</p>
