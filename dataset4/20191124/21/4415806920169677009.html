      <h1>Figures show how 'lack of staff' is impacting on ambulance turnaround times, say FF</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:20:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Fianna Fáil is calling for action to address the deterioration in ambulance turnaround times over the past two years.</p>
      <p>The party's health spokesperson Stephen Donnelly TD has said a lack of staff is to blame.</p>
      <p>Ambulance turnaround times measure the time from ambulance arrival at a hospital to when the crew is ready to accept another call.</p>
      <p>New figures received by Deputy Donnelly show that the HIQA 20-minute target was only met in 15.9% of cases nationwide while the HSE 30-minute target was achieved in 37.1% of cases.</p>
      <p>In Kerry, just 1.7% of ambulances managed the 20-minute turnaround. Another five hospitals nationwide failed to achieve the 5% level.</p>
      <p>Deputy Donnelly claims the main reason for the delay is because emergency departments are too busy with too few staff to process a patient coming in by ambulance.</p>
