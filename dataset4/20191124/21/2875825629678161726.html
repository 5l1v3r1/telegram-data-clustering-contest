      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Bushtucker Trials get more extravagant every year - but the trials boss wants to push the limits by sending the celebs into space.</p>
      <p>Tom Mills, who is the show's Trials Series Producer, would love to get a celebrity inside a spaceship full of snakes and other scary companions.</p>
      <p>Radio presenter Iain Lee had to climb onto the Bush Blaster in 2017, which was suspended a hundred foot in the air, but Tom wants an actual rocket that can launch.</p>
      <p>If he had an unlimited budget, the trials boss said he would give a celeb the time it takes for the spaceship to orbit the Earth once to complete the trial.</p>
      <p>He said: "Well if money really was no object then I'd want a spaceship that a celebrity gets into that is then filled with snakes and other critters.</p>

      <p>"It then takes off and and orbits the Earth once before landing back in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>"The celeb would have the time it takes to orbit the earth to get the stars into the star bag. It takes 92 minutes to orbit the earth, so we'd have to tie those stars in with LOTS of knots.</p>
      <p>Tom explained that he gets inspiration for the trails from anywhere, including while watching films or randomly on the train home from work. but being in Australia inspires him the most.</p>

      <p>Teasing tonight's live trial, the Trials Producer said: "The Live trial is certainly the most nerve racking one for me and the team. Having all the celebs there and it's live on TV that is certainly a challenge.</p>
      <p>"There is definitely a bit of an unknown element going into it as you just don't know how the celebs will react or what they'll do when faced with the gruesome games!"</p>
      <p>Tom was pleased with how 'Ol Dingo Town worked as it was one of the biggest and best sets they have ever built.</p>
      <p>He added: "However we do still have another big one waiting in the wings that will happen very soon."</p>

      <p>When asked what his favourite ever I'm A Celeb trial is, he said: "I love the eating trials. Finding the bizarre bushtucker things for them to eat each year and then coming up with the fun pun names for the dishes is great fun.</p>
      <p>"Plus I can't not mention, CELEBRITY CYCLONE!!! Everyone loves it, which is why we do it every year. I get to test it every year too, so I've actually done it 10 times!</p>
      <p>"Cyclone testing day is certainly one of the highlights of my year. It's great to have such a big, fun and spectacular trial to round off the series with every year.</p>
      <p>Tom has been very impressed with how former EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner have performed in the trials this series.</p>

      <p>On who he thinks has been the best value during this year's trials, Tom said: "I was so impressed with Jacqueline in the Face Your Fears trial this year.</p>
      <p>"Spiders are her biggest fear and she was so nervous before hand. But not only did she do the trial, she did it in the fastest time of all the celebs that played that trial.</p>
      <p>"Stepping up to a challenge like that and conquering your fears is what the show is all about and moments like that are so incredible to watch."</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm loving Caitlyn in the trials so much this year, it's just so crazy that Caitlyn Jenner is doing our trials. Also she has made the ones that she has done so much fun to watch, she has a great energy."</p>
