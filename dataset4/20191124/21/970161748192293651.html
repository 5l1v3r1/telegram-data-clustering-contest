      <p>Last year it was reported that Rob had lost three and a half stone since quitting Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p>

      <p>The girls’ positive words about their brother follow Kim sharing a cute picture of her and daughter Chicago and Rob’s daughter Dream on social media earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Rob is also seen in the background of the shot, which was taken to celebrate Dream’s third birthday.</p>
      <p>She’s growing up so fast.</p>
