      <h2>Hazard wouldn't give the Ballon d'Or to Messi because he feels someone from Liverpool deserves it more</h2>

      <p>Ahead of Real Madrid's crucial Champions League match against PSG, Eden Hazard spoke about his admiration for Kylian Mbappe. "He'll be one of the best players of all-time," and wouldn't think twice about helping his current club add the striker to their ranks.</p>
      <p>"In a few years time he'll be the best player in the world. He's incredibly talented," Hazard told 'Le Parisien'. "If he continues this way, Kylian will be one of the greatest players of all-time. Every player dreams about playing with the best and if I could bring Mbappe to Real Madrid tomorrow, I'd try. Although I don't think anyone would ask for my opinion."</p>
      <p>Hazard doesn't believe the Ballon d'Or should have gone to Lionel Messi this year because "a Liverpool player" deserved it more. "If Sadio (Mane) had won the African Cup of Nations there wouldn't have been any debate (on him claiming the award). Salah too, as he's my friend."</p>
