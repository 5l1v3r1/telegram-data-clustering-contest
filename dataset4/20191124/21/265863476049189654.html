      <h1>Ruth Bader Ginsburg Back Home Following Health Problems</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:01:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, the 86-year-old, Ginsburg, went back to her home in Washington, D.C., and a spokesperson on her behalf stated that the politician was “doing well.” The court spokesperson, Kathy Erberg, revealed the good news on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court claims that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg departed from the hospital in Baltimore where she was being treated for a purported infection.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the political figure was at the John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for two nights and was taken there on Friday due to complaints of fever and chill.</p>
      <p>After she received antibiotics and fluids, her symptoms subsided. Reportedly, Ginsburg has fought cancer four times thus far, two of which occurred this year. In December, the Justice was diagnosed with lung cancer and had to undergo radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas in August.</p>

      <p>In the middle of November, Ginsburg wasn’t present at a public session because of what the court described as stomach flu. She was on the bench the next time the justices all came together again. As it was noted above, Her last hospital stay started on Friday.</p>
      <p>Initially, she was being treated at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington but was later sent to John Hopkins for additional screening and tests. Ruth Bader has been on the bench since 1993 and was first appointed by the controversial ex-president, Bill Clinton.</p>
      <p>The only justice to serve longer than she is Clarence Thomas. Interestingly, justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been described as a “pop culture” icon in recent years following O’Connor’s resignation in 2006. Her differing opinions subsequently led to a rise in memes on social media, one of which referred to her as The Notorious RBG – a reference to the late Biggie Smalls, the rapper who was shot and killed in the late 1990s and became a posthumous legend.</p>
      <p>A few years later, the law student who first created the meme released a book about her life in 2015 which increased the visibility of Ruth Bader further.</p>
