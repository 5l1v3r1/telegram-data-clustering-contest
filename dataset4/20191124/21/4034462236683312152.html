      <h1>Buick's Coolest Model Receives Huge Discount This Month</h1>
      <h2>But the clock is ticking.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:35:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Buick had done an excellent job of turning itself into an upmarket premium brand just short of all-out luxury. The latter duty is handled by GM's Cadillac division. Meanwhile, Buick has proven to be a formidable competitor against the likes of Acura and Lincoln, mainly in the crossover segments. But there's still yet another current Buick model that goes too unnoticed way too often. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/buick/regal-tourx">2020 Buick Regal TourX</a> wagon is one of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/subaru/outback">Subaru Outback</a>'s main competitors thanks to its standard all-wheel drive, sufficient power, and cool styling.</p>
      <p>Like the Outback, the Regal TourX is the less expensive alternative to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/a4-allroad">Audi A4 allroad</a>, which carries a base MSRP of $45,700. The Regal TourX? Just under $30,000. And now Buick is offering up to a 20 percent discount on most 2020 Regal TourX wagons this month, but considering we're already heading into Thanksgiving this week, time is limited to take advantage of this offer.</p>

      <p>If you're a non-GM owner or current competitive owner, then you're eligible for up to 20 percent off MSRP, which equates to nearly $8,000 in savings for "most" Regal TourX models. The offer does not state exactly what "most" means in this case, but Buick does provide the following example: a Regal TourX Essence model with an MSRP of $39,675 receives a $1,364 price reduction below MSRPR along with a $6,571 purchase allowance, adding up to $7,935 in savings for a new total of $31,740.</p>
      <p>The Regal TourX Essence also happens to be the highest trim level. There's also the base TourX 1SV and mid-level Preferred, with MSRPs of $29,995 and $33,595, respectively. The second Regal TourX offer this month is $1,000 cash plus 0 percent APR for 72 months. Both offers, however, must be with GM Financial.</p>

      <p>Along with standard AWD, all Regal TourX wagons come powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four good for 250 horsepower and paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Features such as dual-zone climate control are now standard for 2020. This current offer specifically states buyers must take delivery by December 2, 2019.</p>
