      <p>Nashville Predators forward Viktor Arvidsson is expected to be out 4-6 weeks with a lower-body injury, the team announced Sunday.</p>
      <p>Arvidsson was injured in the first period of Saturday's game against the St. Louis Blues, when he was cross-checked into the Blues' net by defenseman Robert Bortuzzo. He fell after hitting his head on the crossbar. As the 26-year-old tried to get up, Bortuzzo delivered another check to Arvidsson's back, knocking him down again before goaltender Jordan Binnington delivered another hit to the forward.</p>
