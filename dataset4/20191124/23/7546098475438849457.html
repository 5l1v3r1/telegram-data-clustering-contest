      <h1>Saracen share price rises on unconditional Super Pit acquisition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:56:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Saracen Mineral Holdings Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Saracen+Mineral+Holdings+Limited/?ticker=ASX-SAR">(ASX: SAR)</a> share price is one to watch this morning after the company’s Super Pit acquisition is now unconditional. Saracen shares are already up 1.49% in early trade to $3.08 per share. </p>
      <h3>What’s the story behind the acquisition?</h3>
      <p>Last week, Saracen announced <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/18/saracen-minerals-announces-796-million-equity-raising/">a $796 million equity raising</a> to fund its latest acquisition.</p>
      <p>Saracen also took on $400 million of debt, which it used to help fund its purchase of a 50% stake in the Kalgoorlie Super Pit resource. The acquisition gives Saracen a half-share of the asset, which has more than 10 years of life based on existing reserves.</p>
      <p>The Saracen share price fell lower last week following the news, which is not unusual for acquisitive companies.</p>
      <p>However, the purchase does push Saracen’s case as a leading ASX gold producer alongside the likes of <b>Evolution Mining Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-EVN/">(ASX: EVN)</a> and <b>Northern Star Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-NST/">(ASX: NST)</a>.</p>
      <p>The Super Pit produced 730,000 ounces of gold in FY18. For context, Saracen’s FY20 guidance prior to the purchase was 350,000 to 370,000 ounces.</p>
      <p>The other 50% stake will be held by <b>Newmont Goldcorp</b>, one of the world’s leading gold producers.</p>
      <h3>What could move the Saracen share price?</h3>
      <p>The Saracen share price will be on watch after wrapping up its Super Pit acquisition. Another key factor is the company’s increased hedging activities for FY20 announced today.</p>
      <p>The Super Pit purchase is now unconditional and set for completion on 29 November. An additional 200,000 ounces of gold hedging has been added at an average delivery price of A$2,187 per ounce.</p>
      <p>Saracen is de-risking its balance sheet to pay down the $400 million debt taken on for the Super Pit purchase.</p>
      <p>The new hedging maintains Saracen’s policy of having approximately one year’s production hedged over three years.</p>
      <p>The company’s total hedge book now comprises 541,500 ounces at an average of $1,990 per ounce.</p>
      <p>The Saracen share price is already an early mover and will be worth watching as investors try to revalue the stock following last week’s news.</p>
