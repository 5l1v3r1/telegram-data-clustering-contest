      <h1>ATT owner comments on Covington mocking Glenn Robinson’s death: I’m not going to talk trash about somebody who’s passed away</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Things got personal between UFC 245 headliners Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington earlier this month at the pre-fight press conference in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>After accusing Usman of using steroids, ‘Chaos’ brought up the death of Hard Knocks 365 (formerly Blackzilians) co-founder Glenn Robinson, who passed away last year due to heart attack. Covington implied that Usman was responsible for Robinson’s death and said the former coach would be watching ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’ from hell.</p>
      <p>Asked about Covington’s comments, American Top Team (ATT) owner Dan Lambert, who had an ongoing rivalry with Robinson, said it would be hugely irresponsible of him to ‘talk trash’ of Robinson in passing. With that said, he didn’t have nice things to say about the former gym owner either.</p>
      <p>“I mean, the guy [Robinson] obviously wasn’t high on my list of people that I called friends or respected in the business,” Lambert said in an interview with <a href="https://www.lowkickmma.com/exclusive-att-owner-dan-lambert-reacts-to-colby-covington-mentioning-glenn-robinsons-death-at-ufc-245-presser/">TheLowKickMMA’s Jon Fuentes</a>. “But I mean, the guy passed away, what am I going to say? I’m not going to sit here and say great things about a guy just because he passed away. And I’m certainly not going to say bad things about somebody who has passed away. So, it is what it is.”</p>
      <p>UFC 245: Usman vs. Covington will take place next month, December 14 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
