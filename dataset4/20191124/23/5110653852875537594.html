      <h1>Redskins' Dwayne Haskins takes selfies with fans, misses final play of first career win</h1>

      <p>Dwayne Haskins was looking for a Kodak moment.</p>
      <p>The Redskins rookie QB wasn't exactly picture perfect in his first career win vs. the Lions;he went13-of-29 passing for 156 yards and an interception in the 19-16 victory. A fourth-quarter driveled Washington to a go-ahead field goal. But as the 'Skins squeaked out a win, Haskins wasn't on the field to seal the deal.</p>
      <p>Fabian Moreau intercepted Lions QB Jeff Driskell to clinch the victory following the ensuing kickoff,but there were two seconds left on the game clock. The most memorable moment — or non-moment — for Haskins came on the final kneel-down, a play for which he was nowhere to be found.</p>
      <p>Haskins was actually still on the sidelines, taking photos with fans and hyping up the crowd.</p>

      <p>Redskins interimcoach Bill Callahan went searching for his QB but had no luck.Heinstead put Case Keenum on the field to take the game's final snap.</p>
      <p>“I think he thought the game was over,” <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/24/dwayne-haskins-misses-victory-formation-while-taking-photo-with-fans/">Callahan said, per ProFootballTalk</a>. “I’m happy we won. We’ll address that.”</p>
