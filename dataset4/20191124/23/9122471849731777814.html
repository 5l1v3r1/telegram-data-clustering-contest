      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Predicts What’ll Happen If Georgia Beats LSU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:49:48+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Kirk Herbstreit is one of the more interactive college football media personalities on Twitter. The ESPN commentator is always up to respond to fans, whether they need expertise or admonishment.</p>
      <p>With only one week of the regular season and conference championship weekend left, the College Football Playoff picture is shaping up. Herbstreit offered his thoughts on one potential playoff scenario tonight.</p>
      <p>What happens if Clemson and Ohio State win their conference championship games, as expected, but Georgia knocks off LSU in the SEC title game? The Bulldogs are currently the No. 4 team in the playoff rankings, while LSU is No. 1.</p>
      <p>Of course, Georgia would move up at least one spot in the playoff foursome if it beats LSU. But what would happen to the Tigers?</p>
      <p>In Herbstreit’s mind, they would still get in the field as the fourth team.</p>

      <p>For what it’s worth, we’d tend to agree with Herbie here. Say LSU, Oklahoma and Utah are all 12-1.</p>
      <p>Well, the Tigers would be the only one of those three without a conference title, but they’d have wins over Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Texas and Texas A&amp;M. That’s pretty damn good.</p>
      <p>We’ll see how the next two weeks shake out.</p>
