      <p>SHANGHAI: Amazon.com Inc will open a store on Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo on Monday (Nov 25), a source familiar with the matter said, in a sign of how the USÂ firm's China strategy is evolving after it shut its own online store in the country.</p>
      <p>Amazon closed its Chinese marketplace in July, having found it difficult to gain traction in the face of intense competition from entrenched, home-grown rivals like Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall marketplace and JD.com .</p>

      <p>It said at the time it would increase its focus on selling goods from abroad to Chinese buyers via its global platform. It also has a Kindle store on Tmall.</p>
      <p>Alibaba and JD.com have traditionally dominated China's e-commerce market but that status quo was recently disrupted by four-year-old Pinduoduo, which is popular with China's lower-tier city residents.</p>
      <p>The source said Amazon's Pinduoduo store would carry goods from overseas.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Pinduoduo declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Pinduoduo, which woos customers with deep discounts and group buying deals, suffered an US$11 billion slump in value last week after it posted a much wider-than-expected quarterly loss that stemmed from its efforts to fight its rivals with heavy subsidies.</p>
