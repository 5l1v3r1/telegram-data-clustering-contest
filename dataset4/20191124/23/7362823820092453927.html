      <p>He has noted his gratitude for his fearlessness.</p>
      <p>“Fear? As long as I’m healthy I’m good,” Gore told The AP in October.</p>
      <p>“Just knowing it could be taken away from me, that’s why I try to go hard every time,” he added. “What I’ve been through, I know it’s not guaranteed. So why not? I feel if God blessed me to do this, why not go have fun? Why not go 110 (percent)?”</p>

      <p>His love of football has been his lifelong passion.</p>
      <p>When he was a child, he played tackle football with his friends in the backyards, streets and playgrounds in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>
      <p>He took pride in knowing how difficult it was to knock him to the ground.</p>
      <p>It’s the same desire that got him through his injuries, Gore told The AP in October, and what's kept him coming back each season.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think about no age,” Gore said. “As long as you love it, and continue to think young, you can do it, right?”</p>
