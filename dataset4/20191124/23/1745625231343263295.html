      <h3>Devin Nunes Attacks ‘Fake News’ Reports Of His Meetings With Ukrainian Officials</h3>
      <p>

      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a>, the House Intelligence Committee’s top Republican, appeared on Fox News Channel’s <i>Sunday Morning Futures</i> and addressed recent <i>CNN</i> and <i>Daily Beast</i> reports of his involvement in the actions at the center of the impeachment probe into <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/11/24/nunes-we-are-going-to-take-cnn-daily-beast-to-court-these-people-are-sick/"><i>Breitbart</i></a> reports. In particular, the reports suggest that <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/rudy-giuliani/">Rudy Giuliani</a> associate Lev Parnas helped Nunes arrange meetings with Ukrainian officials, including former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, to dig up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have been used to this for the last three years. The House Intelligence Committee Republicans, we continue to expose Democrat corruption over and over again. And what always happens is right when we expose them, what do they do? They go out to kill the messenger. So this week another fake news story.”</blockquote>
      <p>Nunes continued to highlight his recent announcement that he is <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5757955/devin-nunes-sue-cnn-daily-beast/">planning to sue</a> <i>CNN</i> and the <i>Daily Beast</i> after Thanksgiving for allegedly spreading fake reports about his involvement in the Ukraine scandal. Nunes suggests that he will be working with law enforcement and suggested that it’s “not okay” to create a media narrative using someone indicted on federal charges, referring to Parnas.</p>
      <blockquote>“We hope that <i>CNN</i> and the <i>Daily Beast</i> will cooperate with the court, they should comply with the subpoenas once we file this and go through different depositions. It should be fun.”</blockquote>
      <p>Nunes later said he’s that “last guy” that wants to go to court, suggesting that the “totally corrupt” media pushed him to do so by working with “indicted criminals,” calling the people in such corrupt outlets “sick.”</p>

      <p>Joseph Bondy and Ed MacMahon, who are lawyers for Parnas, reportedly claimed that Nunes made a secret trip to Vienna in December of 2018, where he allegedly met with Shokin with the help of Parnas. The pair of lawyers claim that Parnas is willing to comply with a Congressional subpoena and provide documents and testimony for the impeachment probe.</p>

      <p>Per <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/23/20979143/giuliani-lev-parnas-devin-nunes-biden-investigation-impeachment-inquiry"><i>Vox</i></a>, Parnas is currently on house arrest in Florida, and the publication noted that it’s unclear if Parnas would be viewed as a credible witness given the “serious allegations of financial wrongdoing” against him.</p>
      <p>If Nunes did meet Shokin last year, <i>Vox</i> notes that it means the efforts to discredit Biden and his son, Hunter, began earlier than when Giuliani started speaking about them publicly earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Nunes has refused to answer questions regarding his alleged involvement in the Ukraine scandal, and both <i>CNN</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Daily Beast</i> claim to have reached out to Nunes for comment on their pieces; they say their requests were ignored.</p>
