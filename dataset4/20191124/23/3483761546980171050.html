      <p>A COURT has ordered a man to pay $66,000 for leaving a trail of boats illegally moored on Lake Macquarie and other NSW waterways.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Peter Barnett at Belmont Local Court told the 56-year-old man NSW taxpayers were not there to fund his business.</p>
      <p>The court heard the man had a long history of keeping boats in a poor condition and attempting to sell them via online sale websites.</p>
      <p>Over six months this year, he bought 14 vessels, two of which sank and a further six were seized by the state government to prevent them sinking or causing pollution hazards, a spokesperson for Roads and Maritime Services said.</p>
      <p>"He has repeatedly ignored official notices to remove boats which he has left illegally moored on Sydney Harbour, Lake Macquarie, the Hunter River, and in Camden Haven at Laurieton."</p>
      <p>The man was unrepresented and declined assistance in court from Legal Aid NSW, the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to 12 charges for failing to comply with notices to remove the eight vessels, and occupying a mooring without a licence.</p>
      <p>NSW Maritime executive director Mark Hutchings said it cost NSW taxpayers $45,000 to tow, salvage, store and dispose of the eight vessels which were left illegally on other people's moorings and emergency moorings, often blocking a waterway or partially sinking leading to environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>"It's a lesson to all boaties to follow the rules which are there for the benefit of all water users and also a reminder that a $250 fine for a vessel obstructing a mooring can reach up to $5500 once a matter is being considered by a court," Mr Hutchings said.</p>
