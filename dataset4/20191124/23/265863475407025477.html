      <p>The proud and loving mom took to her platform to celebrate her baby girl by posting a super cute video of Kaavia James walking to some inspirational music. The lyrics of the song were meant to encourage darker-skinned fans of the actress to love themselves just the way they are!</p>
      <p>Gabrielle Union is definitely happier than ever now that she is finally a mother and she wants the whole world to know it!</p>
      <p>The clip she posted showed the one year old toddler running around with a lot of energy and cheeriness and Gabrielle also took this opportunity to celebrate her skin color.</p>
      <p>Kaavia can be seen smiling brightly and looking at the camera all the while rocking gray pants with tiny white polka dots all over them, a white shirt and pink slippers.</p>
      <p>In the background, the song ‘Melanin’ by Ciara, Lala Anthony, City Girls, Lupita Nyong’o and Ester Dean can be heard.</p>
      <p>Gabrielle wrote in the caption: ‘Melanin Queens. Be you. Stand up for yourself and anybody being oppressed or beaten down. Stand tall. Speak up. Live loud and proud. Be fearless. Don’t be silenced, We got chu my loves, we got chu. Lift us all up in the light of goodness and hold us there please. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you guys for the perfect anthem @ciara @lala @lupitanyongo City Girls @esterdean #MelaninQueen 🎼🎵🎶.’</p>
