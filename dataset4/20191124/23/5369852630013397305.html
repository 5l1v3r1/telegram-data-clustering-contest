      <p>MANCHESTER CITY boss Pep Guardiola is philosophical about his side’s chances of retaining the Premier League, conceding that Liverpool look “unstoppable” in the title race.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side have yet to lose in the Premier League this season, winning 12 and drawing one of their opening 13 games to build up an eight-point lead at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Taking last season into account, the Reds are unbeaten in 30 Premier League matches stretching back to a defeat against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium at the start of January.</p>
      <p>The champions, in contrast, have lost three times this season already, just one fewer than they lost in the entirety of last season.</p>
      <p>They currently sit third in the table, nine points behind the Merseysiders, after their battling come-from-behind win against Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The manner of that victory suggests City will not relinquish their grip on the trophy easily, though Guardiola concedes it would take a huge turnaround if his side are to overhaul Liverpool and win a third successive title</p>
      <p>And if they do fall short this time, the Spaniard insists it would not be the end of the world as they will have been beaten by the better team.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool look unstoppable,” he said. “I know it’s far away with these numbers. My teams always try but we accept other teams can be better.</p>
      <p>“So [if] we are going to lose the Premier League, we are going to try the next season. It’s not the first time Manchester City in 100 years of history lose the league.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t do it, I’m not going to retire but I’m going to be disappointed.</p>

      <p>“This team never gives up.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola also praised veteran Brazilian Fernandinho, saying his performance against Chelsea on Saturday was “incredible”.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old midfielder once again played out of position at centre-back in the absence of the injured Aymeric Laporte, with Nicolas Otamendi only among the substitutes.</p>
      <p>“He can play there,” added Guardiola. “He was incredible at Anfield.</p>
      <p>“I like Fernandinho in that position, with the problems that we have.”</p>
