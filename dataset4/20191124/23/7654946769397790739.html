      <h1>2 California boys killed in shooting outside elementary school</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:55:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Sorace, Fox News</a></address>
      <p>Two boys in California were killed early Saturday while sitting inside a van in the parking lot of an elementary school when an unknown number of gunmen opened fire into the vehicle, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The boys, ages 11 and 14, were shot outside Searles Elementary School in Union City, located about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco, Union City police <a href="http://nixle.us/BFTMT">said in a news release</a>.</p>
      <p>Multiple residents called 911 and reported hearing gunshots around 1:30 a.m., the <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/11/23/two-killed-in-union-city-shooting-police-investigating/">East Bay Times reported</a>. Police arrived at the school and found the boys with gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>The older boy died at the scene and the younger boy died while being rushed to a hospital, police said. Their names were being withheld because of their age.</p>
      <p>“How do you just kill kids?” a mother, whose son was a schoolmate of one of the deceased boys, <a href="https://abc7news.com/union-city-police-search-for-suspects-in-fatal-shooting-of-2-young-boys/5715937/">told KGO-TV</a>. “I don’t think he has quite grasped this yet,” she said of her son. “He is afraid to go outside.”</p>
      <p>While it was unclear which schools the boys attended, New Haven Unified School District Superintendent John Thompson confirmed they attended schools in the district.</p>
      <p>Family and friends set up a makeshift memorial at the school as police collected shell casings and other evidence for their investigation, KGO reported.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made in connection to the killings. Police said they were still investigating a motive for the shooting.</p>
      <p>The possibilities that the shooting was gang-related or related to a previous shooting on Wednesday that left two men wounded have not been ruled out, police said.</p>
      <p>Police Lt. Steve Mendez told the Times that there was no sign of a connection between the shooting and the school where it took place. He said people occasionally gather in the relatively secluded parking lot.</p>
