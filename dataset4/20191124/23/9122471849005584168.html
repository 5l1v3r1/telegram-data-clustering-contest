      <h1>Video: Gronk’s Rant About The Cowboys-Patriots Game Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:33:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>It’s pretty clear that the weather has been a factor in today’s Cowboys-Patriots game. The three missed field goals from both sides through the first few quarters is proof enough of that.</p>
      <p>Yet the Patriots are holding firm with a 10-6 lead midway through the third quarter. Tom Brady has taken advantage of some opportunities, while Dak Prescott has struggled to get into a rhythm, and with little help from his offense.</p>
      <p>FOX analyst and former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski thinks he knows why the Patriots look so much better.</p>
      <p>In a halftime rant that quickly went viral, Gronk broke down the difference between Bill Belichick and Jerry Jones in getting their teams ready for inclement weather games.</p>
      <p>Gronk said that while Belichick makes sure that his players prepare for every kind of weather, Jones lets the team play indoors when they’re uncomfortable.</p>
      <blockquote>“If there’s a little rain in Dallas, a little snow in Dallas, Jerry Jones comes out and says “Do you guys wanna practice in the bubble today?”</blockquote>

      <p>The proof certainly appears to be in the pudding.</p>
      <p>Despite a clean pocket and a higher completion rate, Prescott and the Cowboys just can’t seem to find the endzone.</p>
      <p>Brady and the Patriots haven’t had much more luck, but they’ve capitalized better.</p>
      <p>Preparation certainly seems to have been a factor.</p>
