      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>Kalvakuntla Krishna Milan Rao, who purportedly rashly drove his car off the Biodiversity flyover and killed a woman on Saturday afternoon, is the relative of a prominent personality. He was on the flyover, with which he was unfamiliar, for the first time ever, and drove at a breakneck speed of 104 kmph.</p>
      <p>The founder-CEO of a city-based firm was going from his Jubilee Hills residence to a business meeting at his office near Meenakshi Towers. Rao’s red Volkswagen (TS09EW5665) collided and dragged along the flyover’s railings for several metres before toppling over and falling a few metres opposite a car showroom near Biodiver-sity junction.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pasala Nagavenkata Satyaveni, a housewife who was standing at the bus stop, was killed instantly. Eyewitnesses said she was hit by the branch of a tree that was uprooted by the car. Satyaveni’s daughter Pranitha, standing alongside, escaped with minor injuries. Autorickshaw driver P. Balu Nayak and software engineer K. Kubra suffered fractures from the debris.</p>
      <p>Milan Rao himself was saved by the car’s airbags and suffered a fracture to his clavicle. He is at a nearby private hospital.</p>
      <p>Milan Rao is the CEO and co-founder of Empow-er Labs, which dubs itself as “India’s first augmented reality gaming company”.</p>
      <p>He was recently engaged to a Karimnagar woman and was scheduled to marry in February 2020.</p>
      <p>Raiduram Inspector S. Ravinder said that since Milan Rao is still undergoing treatment, an oral questioning has been conducted. He was recovering and able to talk.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Raidugram police have registered a case against Milan Rao for causing death by negligence. “Once he is out of the hospital, we will effectively arrest him,” said the inspector. Rao faces a possible two years of imprisonment.</p>
