      <p>Goo Hara, a former member of the K-pop band Kara, was found dead in Seoul on Sunday, police said. She was 28. The cause of death was unclear, and police said they would be holding a press briefing on Monday.</p>
      <p>The South China Post reported she was hospitalized in May after a suicide attempt after she posted "Goodbye" on her Instagram account. Goo appeared in several comeback performances last week, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50535937">BBC News</a>.</p>
      <p>Goo made her debut in 2008, joining the girl group Kara, which had large followings in South Korea, Japan and other Asian countries, according to <a href="https://www.etonline.com/goo-hara-28-year-old-k-pop-star-found-dead-at-her-home-in-south-korea-136960">Entertainment Tonight</a>. She left Kara in 2015 and embarked on a solo career, which also included appearances on numerous TV shows. </p>
      <p>Goo posted this summer on her Instagram that she had signed on with a Japanese management agency and released a song called "Midnight Queen." She had upcoming tour dates planned in Fukuoka, Nagoya, Osaka and Tokyo.</p>

      <p>In 2018, she filed a lawsuit alleging her ex-boyfriend threatened to release a sex tape of her. He was given a suspended jail sentence in August for physically assaulting and blackmailing the star, according to BBC News.</p>
      <p>Goo's death comes just months after K-pop star and actress, Sulli, 25, was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sulli-died-former-fx-member-korean-pop-star-found-dead-her-home-cause-of-death-not-released-2019-10-14/">found dead</a> in Seoul in a suspected suicide.
