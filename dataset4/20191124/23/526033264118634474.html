      <p>Investigators believe the death of the student, Ruth George, was a result of foul play, UIC Police Chief Kevin Booker said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Late Sunday, George's death was ruled a homicide by strangulation, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.</p>
      <p>George's family reported to campus police on Saturday around 11 a.m. that they had not heard from her since the night before, Booker said. Police officers and members of George's family found her in the back seat of a family owned vehicle after her phone pinged to a parking garage on Halsted Street on campus.</p>
      <p>Investigators determined that George was alone when she entered the parking garage around 1:35 a.m. Saturday, and a person of interest was seen entering the garage shortly after she did.</p>
