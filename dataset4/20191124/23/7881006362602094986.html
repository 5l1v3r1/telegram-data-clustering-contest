      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>Winter has finally set in in Hyderabad and the temperatures will continue to drop in the city, say officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the minimum temperature reached 16.9 degrees celsius and the maximum temperature was 29.4 degrees celsius.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Officials of the department said that the second week of November is when the temperature usually falls, triggering the start of the winter season.  The start of the winter season is usually marked by a shortening of daytime and lengthening of nights.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the sunset was at 17:39 hrs and the sunrise for Monday was logged at 06:26 hrs, which is short of twelve hours. Simultaneously, the moonrise was 03:55 hrs and moonset at 16:02 hours, a little over 12 hours. “There is a vivid temperature drop this time of the year. This is a usual phenomenon; it is just the start of the winter season. As the month progresses, the temperature will continue to drop,” Dr K. Naga Ratna, Director, IMD told Deccan Chronicle.</p>
      <p>With cold climes engulfing the city, it is that time of the year, the time to bring out your sweaters and shun fans and air-conditioners.</p>
      <p>The change in the weather could also be seen along the roadsides where various winterwear stalls were set up.</p>
