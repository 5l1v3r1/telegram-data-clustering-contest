      <p>Carson Wentz had a Sunday to forget as the Philadelphia Eagles were beaten 17-9 in an NFC battle with the Seattle Seahawks, while Frank Gore moved third on the all-time NFL rushing list.</p>
      <p>The injury-hit Eagles really needed a win to put pressure on NFC East leaders the Dallas Cowboys, but fell to 5-6 after quarterback Wentz and the Philadelphia offense failed to fire in Week 12.</p>
      <p>Second-placed Seattle are 9-2 in the NFC West after improving their perfect record on the road to 6-0, Rashaad Penny playing a huge part in their fourth consecutive win.</p>
      <p>Gore moved past Barry Sanders on the list of the leading rushers in a 20-3 victory for the Buffalo Bills over the Denver Broncos.</p>
      <p>Wil Lutz's last-gasp field goal snatched a 34-31 win for the New Orleans Saints over the Carolina Panthers, while Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph was benched in a 16-10 success against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
      <p>There were also victories for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Chicago Bears, New York Jets, Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins.</p>

        <b>WENTZ UNABLE TO GET EAGLES SOARING</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eagles signal caller Wentz's critics were out in force again after he was 33 of 45 for 256 yards, with one touchdown.</p>
      <p>There were also two interceptions and a couple of lost fumbles for the 26-year-old, who was also reportedly checked out for a hand injury.</p>
      <p>Wentz threw a TD pass to Zach Ertz in the final minute, but the damage had already been done.</p>
      <p>Seattle running back Rashaad Penny ran for a career-best 129 yards, including a 58-yard touchdown, while MVP contender Russell Wilson was sacked six times but was 13 of 25 for 200 yards, with one TD and one pick.</p>
      <p>
        <b>GORE THE MERRIER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Star running back Gore moved beyond Hall of Famer Sanders' tally of 15,269 yards with a seven-yard dart in the fourth quarter of a victory for the Bills.</p>
      <p>Gore made 65 yards in 15 carries and took his career total to an astonishing 15,289 yards.</p>
      <p>Buffalo are 8-3 in the AFC East behind the New England Patriots, while the struggling Broncos are 3-8 at the foot of the AFC West.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LUTZ SEALS DRAMATIC SAINTS WIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lutz stepped up as time expired to give the Saints a four-game lead over the Panthers at the top of the NFC South</p>
      <p>Joey Slye missed a field goal at the other end from 28 yards out with two minutes to play, but Lutz held his nerve with a 33-yard kick.</p>
      <p>Two attempts from Christian McCaffrey were in vain as Drew Brees completed 30 of 39 passes for 311 yards and three touchdowns in a captivating contest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MORE PAIN FOR RUDOLPH</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rudolph was fined $50,000 for his part in an ugly brawl late in a defeat to the Browns last week.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive end Myles Garrett ripped off Rudolph's helmet and hit him on the head with it as things got out of hand in Week 11.</p>
      <p>Steelers quarterback Rudolph escaped a ban, but he was sidelined during the clash with the sorry Bengals when Devlin Hodges replaced him during the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Hodges wasted no time in making an impact, picking out James Washington for a 79-yard catch-and-run touchdown as the Bengals suffered yet another loss to go 0-11.</p>
