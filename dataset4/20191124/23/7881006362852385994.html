      <p><b>Mumbai: </b>As the power struggle in Maharashtra  intensifies, the BJP has expressed confidence that its government would complete its five-year term.</p>
      <p>The BJP held a meeting of its newly elected MLAs at its office Vasant Smriti at Dadar on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The meeting was attended by most of the 105-elected members of the BJP, barring six MLAs.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the meeting, Mr Shelar said that the strategy to comfortably pass the floor test was discussed and decided in the meeting.</p>
      <p>“We also passed a resolution congratulating Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar on taking oath as Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister. The state witnessed a festive atmosphere when Mr Fadnavis took oath as the CM,” he said.</p>
      <p>The party also accused the Sena of committing the ‘sin’ of abandoning its founder Bal Thackeray’s thoughts of aligning with the BJP by going with the Congress and the NCP for the sake of acquiring power in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>“The Sena committed the sin of abandoning Bal Thackeray’s thoughts of aligning with the BJP and insulting the popular mandate by going with the Congress and the NCP,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Shelar expressed  confidence that Mr Fad-navis will win the floor test with a majority in the 288-member Assembly.</p>
      <p>“The legislature party meeting deliberated on strategy to be adopted during the floor test,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also justified the BJP’s move to align with Ajit Pawar, saying even the Sena has joined hands with Congress president Sonia Gandhi.</p>
      <p>He also said that Ajit Pawar’s whip would be applicable to MLAs of the NCP by virtue of him being the ‘leader of the NCP legislature party.’</p>
      <p>“BJP leaders Sudhir Mungantiwar and Suresh Khade could not attend the meeting due to some preoccupations while four MLAs could not attend it due to personal reasons,” Mr Shelar said.</p>
