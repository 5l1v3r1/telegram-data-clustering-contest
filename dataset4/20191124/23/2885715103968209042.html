      <p>Senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim on Sunday slammed the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> for destroying the ethics in politics after the way it came to power in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Hakim said there is no loyalty and mortality in politics.</p>
      <p>“It is very unfortunate the way the BJP is destroying the loyalty and morality in politics. They had done it in Karnataka, Goa and now they have replicated that in Maharashtra. They may have temporarily formed the government, but they have destroyed the ethics in politics,” said Hakim.</p>
      <p>After a pre-dawn revocation of President’s rule, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> was sworn in as Maharashtra chief minister at 7.50 am on Saturday with Ajit Pawar offering the support of the NCP. Pawar took oath as the deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>The BJP, however, is yet to pass a floor test in the state Assembly.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a>-Congress and NCP combine have moved the Supreme Court asking the swearing-in to be quashed as unconstitutional.</p>
