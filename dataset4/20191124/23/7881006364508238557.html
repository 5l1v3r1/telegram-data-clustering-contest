      <p><b>Hyderabad</b>: Seeing the municipal polls as a run-up to the 2023 Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state wing is preparing its cadres to give a tough fight to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the Congress in the ensuing elections to Urban Local Bodies in the state.</p>
      <p>The BJP has been holding meetings of leaders and workers, Lok Sabha constituency-wise in the state.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>BJP senior leader and MLC N. Ramachandra Rao said that the party has listed out the problems each municipality and corporation faces, and in the old municipalities and corporations, it has listed the promises and development programmes that are still pending in order to expose the failures of the ruling party.</p>
      <p>He said that based on the inputs from the cadres with regard to problems of each ward, the party will prepare the manifesto for each municipality and Corporation.</p>
      <p>Mr Rao explained that in the second round of meetings they will identify the candidates who will be contesting in all the municipal wards in which elections will be held after the High Court gives its final decision with regard to civic body polls.</p>
      <p>Party leaders are of the opinion that as the BJP has a considerable vote bank in the urban areas, it would likely perform well there if party cadres are well prepared.</p>
