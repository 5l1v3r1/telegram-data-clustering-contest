      <p>The Newell Highway Mungle Back Creek to Boggabilla upgrades will be among a number of road and rail projects to be fast-tracked by the federal government.</p>
      <p>The Morrison Government has been working with states and territories to bring forward critical road projects across Australia to drive jobs, strengthen the economy and get people home sooner and safer.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the infrastructure boost on Thursday and said the NSW package included the acceleration of $530 million in federal funding across three major regional projects that would increase safety, improve freight productivity and boost tourism.</p>
      <p>He said $212 million of the new package would be spent in the next 18 months as part of a $33 billion investment in NSW infrastructure from the federal government since the 2013 election.</p>
      <p>"We're bringing forward these important projects to cut travel times and make roads safer while boosting jobs and the economy," the Prime Minister said.</p>
      <p>"We can get these projects moving because of our responsible economic management rather than the sort of knee-jerk reactions we've seen in the past from Labor. This is a key part of our plan for a stronger economy and our pipeline of $100 billion worth of congestion-busting roads and rail."</p>
      <p>As part of the project funding being brought forward, the federal government has fully funded the $81.1 million for stage two of the <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6224056/moree-wins-big-in-state-budget-with-hospital-redevelopment-locked-in/">Newell Highway's Mungle Back Creek to Boggabilla project</a>.</p>
      <p>The $200 million investment in the Newell Highway to support construction of the Parkes Bypass and the delivery of Inland Rail will also be accelerated.</p>
      <p>NSW Minister for Regional Transport and Roads Paul Toole said the package was a big win for regional areas would help fast track benefits of infrastructure investment for the bush.</p>
      <p>"This is a fantastic example of federal and state governments working closely together to deliver concrete outcomes across the state, including for regional communities," he said.</p>
