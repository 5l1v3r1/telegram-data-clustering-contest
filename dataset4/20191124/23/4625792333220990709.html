      <h1>‘He picked the wrong house’: 82-year-old bodybuilder takes out home invader, 29, with table</h1>

      <p>An 82-year-old woman clocked a 29-year-old man over the head with a table after he attempted to break into her home.</p>
      <p>Willie Murphy was in her Rochester, New York, home last Thursday when she heard someone trying to break in. She called 911, but she didn’t wait for someone else to come and rescue her.</p>
      <p>Murphy grabbed her kitchen table and swung it at the man, knocking him to the floor and shattering the table. Once he was down, she took a broom and started whacking him with it. When it looked as though he wouldn’t be able to get up and fight back, Murphy grabbed a nearby bottle of shampoo and poured it on his face, leaving him in a painful mess on the floor until police arrived.</p>
      <p>During an <a href="https://foxrochester.com/news/nation-world/he-picked-the-wrong-house-82-year-old-beats-up-break-in-suspect">interview</a> with WHAM, Murphy explained that she's old, but that doesn’t mean she’s not tough.</p>

      <p>“A young man is in my home, broke the door, and you know what, it’s kind of semi-dark, and I’m alone, and I’m old, but guess what. I’m tough,” Murphy said. “He picked the wrong house to break into.”</p>
      <p>She later added, “I had really done a number on that man. I’m serious.”</p>
      <p>Murphy proudly explained the details of how she sent the home intruder to the hospital, saying, “I think he was happy when he went home in the ambulance. Because I sent him in an ambulance. Yes, I did.”</p>
      <p>Murphy, who stands at just 5 feet tall and 105 pounds, <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2018/04/06/81-year-old-willie-murphy-powerlifting-weightlifting-inspiration/448623002/"><u>told</u></a> the <i>Democrat &amp; Chronicle</i> she built up her strength by working out at her local YMCA, where she started by doing exercises with 5-pound weights at 6 a.m. three days per week. The 82-year-old can now dead lift 225 pounds and won her division as 2014 Lifter of the Year at the Powerlifting Federation World Championships.</p>
      <p>Before she became known for her strength, Murphy worked as a social worker. Her workouts have gained <a href="https://www.today.com/video/meet-the-weightlifting-grandmother-defying-her-age-1365115971969">nationwide</a> attention, including a feature on <i>Good Morning America.</i></p>
