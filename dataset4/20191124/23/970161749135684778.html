      <p>Little Mix star Perrie Edwards has shut down talk of rifts between her and bandmates Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson.</p>
      <p>Rumours of tension have plagued the British group for years but Perrie has shut them down once and for all.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/little-mix-deny-rift-rumours-20951588">The Mirror</a> at Radio 1 Teen Awards in London today, Perrie said: ‘We’ve always had rumours [of arguments] the last few years.</p>
      <p>‘But that comes with being in a girl band. People assume girls don’t get along with girls.’</p>
      <p>Little Mix won the best group prize at the awards.</p>
      <p>Jade, who joined Perrie at the event, chimed in: ‘We literally never fight. We’re really boring.’</p>
      <p>Speaking about Little Mix’s sixth LP, Jade added: ‘We go back into the studio next week to start writing our next album so we can’t wait to do that.’</p>

      <p>The girls’ last effort, LM5, reached number three in the UK album charts last year.</p>

      <p>Perrie also chatted about the girls’ upcoming music talent search show Little Mix: The Search, which will air on BBC1 in the coveted Saturday night slot at some point next year.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Auditions are happening now. There have been thousands of people auditioning. It’s insane.’</p>

      <p>According to the BBC, the winning group ‘could be all-female, all-male or mixed [and] get a career launch-pad like no other – supporting Little Mix on their UK Summer Tour 2020’.</p>
      <p>The group will certainly have great mentors in the form of Little Mix, who famously got together on the 2011 series of X Factor.</p>
      <p>Their number one singles are Black Magic, Wings, Shout Out to My Ex and their debut single Cannonball.</p>
      <p>We can’t wait for 2020, and a new decade of Little Mix.</p>
