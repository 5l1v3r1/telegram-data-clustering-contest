        <b>Good news for fans of <a href="https://stadia.google.com/">Google‚Äôs game streaming</a> service <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/03/googles-new-game-service-is-based-on-linux-open-source-tech">Stadia</a>: it works on Ubuntu!</b>
      </p>
      <p>That‚Äôs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/e02zj9/stadia_on_ubuntu/">according to Redditors</a> lucky enough to be able to try the recently-launched service on their Ubuntu machines (note: it‚Äôs <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9338852?hl=en-GB">not available in every country</a> yet).</p>
      <p>Admittedly this ‚Äúnews‚Äù isn‚Äôt unexpected.</p>
      <p>Stadia is a cloud-based gaming service powered by Linux, and is advertised to work on Chromebooks (which are Linux-based machines) as well as via the Google Chromecast Ultra.</p>
      <p>So, in a shock to that one person who was asleep most of the summer, I hear that Stadia DOES work in the Google Chrome web browser on Ubuntu.</p>
      <p>Just, er, not very well, it seems‚Ä¶</p>
      <h3>Playing Stadia on Ubuntu</h3>
      <p>Now, before you let your eyes venture on down past this section. let me stress that I, personally, have not tried to play Stadia on Ubuntu.</p>
      <aside>Stadia works in Google Chrome on Linux ‚Ä¶Just not very well ‚Äî and Google‚Äôs to blame!</aside>
      <p>And I haven‚Äôt tried it because a) I am not a Stadia subscriber (backer? founder?) and b) when it comes to gaming I secretly still consider the 32-bit era of gaming to be a modern fad üòÜ ‚Äî #snes4ever.</p>
      <p>BUT, lots of users have been sharing their experiences on using the service over on the opinion smorgasbord we all know as Reddit.</p>
      <p>Among them Stadia subscriber <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xzaninou/">~Xzaninou</a>, who recounts his experience of playing Destiny on Stadia in Google Chrome on an Ubuntu machine:</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a Dell XPS 15 with Ubuntu with a good internet connection [‚Ä¶] but when I actually tried to play for real, Destiny was unplayable,</i>‚Äù he writes.</p>
      <p>‚Äú<i>I had ~1sec delay between input and game actually responding! Plus, my computer fans were going crazy‚Ä¶‚Äù</i></p>
      <p>His issue, it turns out, is that Google Chrome on Ubuntu does not support hardware acceleration (nor does it on other Linux distros, either) ‚Äî a glaring omission that <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/10/hardware-acceleration-chrome-linux">we‚Äôve mentioned on this site before</a>.</p>
      <p>But, naturally, this is open source and there are workarounds.</p>
      <h4>Chromium Snap App</h4>
      <p>Installing a Snap version of the Chromium web browser with a <code>vaapi</code> (i.e. hardware acceleration) patch applied does wonders to the performance of Stadia.</p>
      <p>As does toggling the <code>override software rendering list</code> flag on in <code>chromium://flags</code>, resulting in an eminently playable experience:</p>
      <p>
        <i>‚ÄùI logged in with my Google account and launched Destiny 2, my computer CPUs were not all 100% like before (more like 30%) and the game was actually playable with barely noticeable lags.‚Äù</i>
      </p>
      <p>Sadly the unstable patched Chromium Snap app this user tried? It has issues with USB devices which may affect the ability to play with game pads.</p>
      <p>One workaround to the workaround (for now) is to use <a href="https://launchpad.net/~saiarcot895/+archive/ubuntu/chromium-dev">saiarcot895‚Äôs Chromium builds PPA</a> (and yes: the usual caveats about PPAs still apply).</p>
      <p>As with anything Stadia related never overlook your network performance (be it your actual connection, your router, or your desktop config) as a factor.</p>
