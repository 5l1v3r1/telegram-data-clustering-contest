      <h1>Looks Like Rage Against The Machine Were Leaked As The Splendour 2020 Headliners</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:52:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:52</time> by <a rel="author">Junkee</a></address>
      <p>A few weeks back, Rage Against The Machine announced they were <a href="https://junkee.com/rage-against-the-machine-reunited/227083">reuniting for a string of headlining dates</a> across North America in 2020.</p>
      <p>They were also revealed as the headliners for California’s Coachella, but it looks like that might not be the only festival they’ll be appearing at next year. <a href="https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/rage-against-the-machine-splendour/">As per </a><i><a href="https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/rage-against-the-machine-splendour/">Tone Deaf</a>, </i>it looks as if the band may have leaked their appearance at Splendour in the Grass on Instagram last night.</p>
      <p>The post (which has now been deleted, of course) flags that they’ll be landing in Byron Bay on July 18 — which is prime Splendour time — with additional shows planned in Melbourne and Auckland. See a screenshot below:</p>

      <p>At the time of writing, there has been no confirmation from the band or from Splendour organisers about whether the tour is legitimate. Music Junkee has contacted Splendour for comment.</p>
      <p>If so, it’ll mean a big year for reunion tours down under, with My Chemical Romance having already been locked in to <a href="https://junkee.com/my-chemical-romance-australian-tour-memes/227708">headline Download Australia in March</a>.</p>
