      <h4>Rosemary Nwisi, Port Harcourt</h4>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians to embrace and invest in agriculture to create jobs and eradicate poverty in the country.</p>
      <p>The President spoke in a visual message at the 23rd edition of Farmers Day celebration organised by Agip and its partners, (NNPC/NAOC/Oando) under the Joint Venture (JV) programme for their hosts communities at Obie in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State.</p>
      <p>The event, with the theme: Farm and Fortune, held at the weekend.</p>
      <p>President Buhari said it had been the agenda of his administration to revive and grow the agricultural sector into a hub in Africa.</p>
      <p>The President explained that the Federal Government under his watch had put huge amounts into the sector since he assumed office in 2015 to realise the dream.</p>

      <p>He stressed that the agricultural sector holds great fortune and massive employment opportunities for the citizenry when properly developed.</p>
      <p>President Buhari urged investors to take advantage of the investment opportunities in the sector.</p>
      <p>“We neglected farming in the time past, but we are wiser now as a nation. We will also take precautions of bad harvest.</p>
      <p>“Agriculture is a veritable tool for economic recovery. It engenders better living standard and ensures food security. Agriculture will improve food security and provide jobs. Farmers are our authentic healers now and years ahead. We want to make farming our bedrock,” he said.</p>
      <p>The President hailed the Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC) for empowering and developing thousands of farmers from its host communities in Rivers, Bayelsa, Imo and Delta states through its Green River Project agricultural programme.</p>
      <p>“I commend the Nigerian Agip Oil Company for their efforts in repositioning agriculture. I urge others to emulate the examples set.</p>
      <p>“I urge you the farmers to make good use of the investment made by the company,” he said.</p>
      <p>President Buhari hailed Nigerian farmers for leading the country to the path of self-sufficiency and food security.</p>
      <p>Group Managing Director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mele Kyari, who was represented by Ben Halliday, praised NAOC for venturing into the Green River Project.</p>
      <p>The company chief said this had impacted immensely its areas of operation.</p>
      <p>Also, NAOC Chairman Guido Brusco said Farmers’ Day celebration is an important activity in the company’s calendar.</p>
      <p>He said it gives the company the opportunity to partner and improve local communities, eradicate hunger, create jobs and promote sustainable agriculture.</p>
      <p>The company chairman noted that the GRP had impacted more than 120 communities and reached out to over 500,000 people in Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta and Imo states.</p>
      <p>He added: “Between 2010 and 2018, we have undertaken over 307 projects in about 118 communities. These projects cut across sectors, such as access to energy, education, roads, health, water as well as social, cultural and commercial investments.”</p>
