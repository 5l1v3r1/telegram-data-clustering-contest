      <p>Irish Comedian <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/andrew-maxwell">Andrew Maxwell</a> sparked another series of 'ridiculous' rows during tonight's episode of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here</a> !</p>
      <p>The Ex On The Beach narrator, 44, has become one of the famously controversial characters of the series, with many viewers slamming the star after he became embroiled in his third argument during his time Down Under.</p>
      <p>Comedian Andrew has now argued with fellow campmates soap star Jacqueline Jossa, former footballer <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ian-wright">Ian Wright</a> and rugby hunk James Haskell.</p>
      <p>Viewers on social media have slated the star for "winding people up" and creating "drama".</p>
      <p>It all started on Thursday's episode when Andrew's feathers were ruffled after <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> refused to go to the jungle jailhouse.</p>

      <p>Andrew questioned her decision to eliminate herself from the vote and swiped at the soap star, 27, for not being part of the team.</p>
      <p>He didn't seem impressed by Jacqueline's attempt to avoid the challenge, saying: "I think it has to be everyone in, I don't think it's fair to count yourself out."</p>
      <p>Andrew came to blows once again tonight with both camp king <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/james-haskell">James Haskell</a> and Arsenal football legend Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>Things got seriously tense during tonight’s episode when Ian and Andrew ended up in an argument over who had priority in the roast dinner challenge.</p>

      <p>The comedian accused Ian, 56, of singling him out and barked: "You keep shouting at me."</p>
      <p>Former footballer Ian looked at him and said: “Who is shouting, when did I shout?”, to which Andrew replied: "Just then."</p>
      <p>Ian argued back: "I wasn’t even talking to you, what did I say?"</p>
      <p>When he asked what he’d supposedly said, Andrew replied: "I can’t remember, I’m tired", before storming off.</p>
      <p>The comedian also found himself facing off against England rugby legend and newly elected Camp Leader James as camp voted on the answer to a question that could win them a treat after a successful Dingo Dollar challenge.</p>

      <p>As Kate Garraway and Roman Kemp were presented a choice between salted nuts and jelly beans at the Outback Shack, the rest of camp was asked a question that would win them one of the two.</p>
      <p>James called for a show of hands for each, and the camp went for 79%, despite Andrew insisting: "Not everyone put their hands up."</p>
      <p>At that point, Andrew threw another sulk and moaned: "It's just as shambolic as ever. We're not getting chocolate."</p>
      <p>Following Andrew's third row, viewers at home took to social media to share their opinions, with many slamming the campmate for his regular outbursts.</p>

      <p>One user wrote: "Get Andrew out of the jungle, he uses tiredness as an excuse to be a d*** and constantly makes little digs and causes animosity in the camp."</p>
      <p>Another posted: "Officially loathe Andrew. Winding people up so they get mad at him, then has a hug 2 seconds later."</p>
      <p>While a third argued: "Andrew on I’m a celebrity is an absolute tool Ian Wright “what did I shout at you” Andrew “I cant remember now I’m to upset."</p>
      <p>Another shared: "What is wrong with this Andrew guy! Always creating drama and then apologising!"</p>
      <p>While others praised Andrew for being honest and "apologising" when he is in the wrong.</p>
      <p>One viewer stood up for the comedian, writing: "The most realistic one in there. Yeah he can be a bit unreasonable but at least he owns up to his mistakes and apologizes."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Andrew may have been wrong, but he is allowed his own opinion."</p>

      <p>Everything got a bit too much for Andrew during tonight's episode after he broke down in tears and threatened to walk out.</p>
      <p>He confessed he had "hit a wall" as he became "overwhelmed" with jungle life.</p>
      <p>This comes just a few days after Andrew started chocking on camel meat and was saved by his fellow campmates.</p>
      <p>The comedian got camel meat lodged in his throat leaving him struggling to breathe.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway and Andy Whyment rushed over to help choking Andrew as he sat on his knees trying to bring the food up.</p>
      <p>As they slapped his back, they helped him spit it out, before he looked up to the heavens.</p>
