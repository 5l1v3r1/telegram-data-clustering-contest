      <p>NEW YORK -- The Coast Guard has suspended operations of some New York Waterway ferries over safety discrepancies.</p>
      <p>The agency says all 32 vessels in the company's fleet were inspected over the last week, with 23 vessels taken out of operation.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard on Sunday said six of those suspended vessels have been put back in service.</p>
      <p>NY Waterway spokesman Patrick Smith says the company is working with the Coast Guard to address the issues as quickly as possible.</p>
