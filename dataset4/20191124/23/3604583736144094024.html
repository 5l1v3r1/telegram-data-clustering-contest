      <p>Federation University Associate Professor Elisa Zentveld, Lateral Plains director George Fong and Ballarat iPhones owner David Mulraney presented on the topic <i>Family violence victims and perpetrators: how technology connects them</i> during a free community event on Friday for White Ribbon Day.</p>
      <p>Dr Zentveld said research showed there was an elevated risk of family violence perpetrated through technology during the time of separation - constant abuse, stalking and surveillance was something she personally experienced when separating from her violent ex-husband.</p>
      <p>"A common theme from talking to victims is a feeling of omnipresence. Technology can play a major role in overwhelming someone and making them feel like they can't escape," she said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Research has revealed 98 per cent of people presenting to a family violence service report technology facilitated stalking and abuse as a part of their experience of family violence.</p>
      <p>Ms Zentveld referred to one victim who said she received around 30 messages and calls during a one hour counselling session as an example of technological abuse.</p>
      <p>"I had to ring Apple to sort out my phone and google account because he was sending me messages letting me know he knew where I was," another victim had told her.</p>
      <p>Other examples of technological stalking, harassment and abuse include perpetrators installing tracking software on children's phones, spyware on a victim's computer, installing cameras in a victim's home, putting a GPS tracking device in a child's doll, backpack or toy, using social media to humiliate, punish and stalk and text messages to harass and verbally abuse.</p>
      <blockquote>Many people don't understand what smartphones are capable of.<cite>David Mulraney, Ballarat iPhones</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Mr Mulraney outlined steps during the presentation for victims to establish a technological defence to prevent harassment, stalking and abuse.</p>
      <p>"One thing we noticed a lot with our customers is many don't understand what smartphones are capable of," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Mulraney said the first step in protection was to be aware of the information contained in your mobile phone, including personal details and data like location tracking of everywhere you go.</p>
      <p>He recommended setting up different passwords for every personal account, suggested keeping track of passwords using an application like Last Pass and installing two factor authentication.</p>
      <p>"It makes it a lot harder for someone who is harassing or stalking to get into your accounts if the passwords are regularly changing - it puts a road block in their way," Mr Mulraney said.</p>

      <p>Mr Mulraney advised against sharing accounts with partners and said it was important to ensure your partner's name was not listed on your mobile phone account.</p>
      <p>If you are suspicious someone is accessing your account, you can check activity logs that show IP addresses. He said mobile phone devices could be backed up and re-set to factory settings as a last resort to ensure no one else had access to information on your device.</p>
      <p>As the final presenter, Mr Fong provided an in depth insight into internet security and warned internet users leave 'bits and pieces of information all over the place' through a large digital footprint.</p>
      <blockquote>While technology can be a threat, it can also be an ally.<cite>George Fong, Lateral Plains</cite></blockquote>
      <p>To protect personal data, Mr Fong recommended switching off metadata for photographs and regularly clearing caches, browsing histories and cookies.</p>
      <p>"If you have a gut feeling that something is wrong, follow it through. While technology can be a threat, it can also be an ally," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Fong and Mr Mulraney said they were prepared to work with family violence support services in Ballarat to provide advice to clients on how to take these protective actions.</p>
      <p>"Technology can be overwhelming but it is such a major part of our lives these days. No one should be intimidated into not using technology because of a perpetrator of family violence," Mr Fong said.</p>
      <p>While national organisation White Ribbon Day Australia has entered into liquidation, communities like Ballarat will continue the White Ribbon legacy with presentations and events like this.</p>
      <p>White Ribbon Ballarat is an independent entity that has a local committee and is continuing to advocate for a culture of equality and respect as an end to family violence.</p>

      <p>This will continue on Monday during the international day for the elimination of violence against women on Monday.</p>
      <p>White Ribbon Ambassador and Federation University Director of Corporate Governance Adrian Tinetti introduced the talk for White Ribbon Day on Friday.</p>
      <p>"The key to it is that cultural shift. Yes we have a lot of work to do but with the younger generations we are making a difference," he said.</p>
