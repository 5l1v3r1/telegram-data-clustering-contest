      <p><b>HOLYOKE, Mass.</b> - Police in one Massachusetts community have issued a warning about a particular kind of heroin after responding to nine overdoses in 16 hours.</p>
      <p>Holyoke police said Saturday that they believe each of the people who overdosed on Friday had used heroin packaged in bags stamped with the word "POWER."</p>
      <p>One of those who overdosed on Friday died, while the other eight were saved after receiving emergency medical help.</p>
      <p>Authorities say that while they don't normally identify the stamps found on particular bags of heroin, they did so because the type involved in Friday's overdoses is so dangerous.</p>
      <p>According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health there were 611 opioid-related overdose deaths in the state in the first six months of 2019.</p>
