      <p>Ian Wright was spotted trying to secretly throw up on tonight's disgusting I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Viewers at home started feeling sick and struggled to watch the live Bushtucker trial as Ian was repeatedly retching throughout.</p>
      <p>The former footballer began gagging before the trial even begun - and was told off by Jacqueline Jossa for making her feel sick.</p>
      <p>Ian successfully managed to get a star out of a tub of slime but came dangerously close to throwing up afterwards.</p>
      <p>Things got a lot worse for Ian when he was forced to drink blended pig's penis - and it didn't stay down for long.</p>

      <p>During the Love Island themed trial, Ian had to drink Casa A Gore while sat in a hot tub filled with baby crocodiles.</p>
      <p>Ian drank the disgusting cocktail in about three seconds but then struggled to keep it down as it dribbled down his mouth.</p>
      <p>When cheeky Dec Donnelly asked if it tasted "porky", Ian retched once more then gagged as he jumped out of the pool.</p>

      <p>Ian looked like a drunken student as he stumbled around covering his hand with his mouth.</p>
      <p>He was then clocked keeling over near a bush and appeared to release a small amount of chunder.</p>
      <p>To make matters even worse - hangry Ian will be one of those going without a meal after the campmates failed to get all 12 stars.</p>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after watching the disgusting moment.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "Ian Wright gagging after downing a pint of blended pig dicks, while in a hot tub with a VERY confused Caitlyn Jenner and Andrew Maxwell who's preoccupied touching crocodiles is just a metaphor for 2019"</p>
      <p>"The worst part of this trial is Ian repeatedly burping, its making me feel sick," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "I genuinely was mentally preparing myself to watch Ian Wright throw up everywhere. Like, everywhere. What is I’m A Celeb doing to me?!"</p>
      <p>"Ant and Dec trying to act like everything’s moral and present their scripted jokes with Ian constantly gaging in the background honestly got me in tears," said a fourth.</p>

      <p>Ian actually faced 'cheating' claims earlier in the trial after he appeared to use his hands to pick up a star.</p>
      <p>Rather appropriately, Ant and Dec took the decision to VAR, but decided he could have the star because he did manage to get it out before dropping it back in.</p>
      <p>The second part saw Cliff, Adele, James and Roman sat down as they tried to get six pigs testicles from one side of the seating area to the other using their mouths - and they got all three meals.</p>

      <p>Next up, Ian, Andrew and Caitlyn were sat in the hot tub drinking their disgusting Love Island themed drinks including Caroline Yack and Ian Hurling.</p>
      <p>The trio all successfully completed that section of the trial - even if Ian did seemingly throw up in the bush.</p>
      <p>The last trial saw James and Roman on a day bed where they had to transfer stars from one box to the other filled with the creepy crawlies and snakes.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>James struggled to get the stars off because of a giant crab and Roman could not screw them down in time and they failed to win a single star.</p>
      <p>That meant the camp only got nine out of twelve stars - so Ian, Cliff and Andy missed out on a roast dinner as they were last on the list.</p>
      <p>Ian looked dejected as he left to return to camp as he has been complaining about a lack of food in recent days.</p>
