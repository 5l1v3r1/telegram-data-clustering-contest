      <p>Winter seems to be eluding major parts of Maharashtra so far this year, with the temperatures likely to remain above normal till the end of this month.</p>
      <p>In Pune, warm atmospheric conditions will keep the day temperatures close to the 30 degrees Celsius mark, whereas the minimum temperatures over the city will range between 16 and 17 degrees Celsius till November 30, officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Sunday.</p>
      <p>While Mahabaleshwar (14 degrees Celsius) recorded lowest temperature in the state on Sunday, the chill factor was missing from most cities in Madhya Maharashtra, an official said.</p>
      <p>A fresh western disturbance is approaching the extreme northern regions, including Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab regions, this week, which is likely to bring down temperatures there, said the official.</p>
      <p>“Under its influence, there could be fairly widespread rainfall over western Himalayas,” said a Met official.</p>
      <p>On November 28 and November 29, there are chances of overcast sky over Pune and neighbouring areas, leading to further moisture incursion, the Met official added.</p>
