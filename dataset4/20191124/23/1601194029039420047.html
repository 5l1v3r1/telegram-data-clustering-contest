      <p>When All Elite Wrestling started up earlier this year, one of the performers to quickly catch the hearts of the fanbase was <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kylie-rae">Kylie Rae</a>. Several vignettes through Being the Elite and various videos on AEW's official YouTube channel gave fans a reason to get behind the rising star.</p>
      <p>At Double or Nothing, she lost a four-way match between herself, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/britt-baker">Britt Baker</a>, Awesome Kong, and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/nyla-rose">Nyla Rose</a>. Following that, she was set to take on Leva Bates at Fyter Fest later on in the summer. However, she was replaced by Allie with little reasoning given.</p>
      <p>Soon after, though, it had been revealed that she had requested her release from the company. Tony Khan made the announcement at a media scrum following AEW All Out, saying that the split was amicable and that they wished her the best.</p>
      <p>It was rumored going forward that Rae was leaving the wrestling world altogether. However, that would soon be disproven when she returned to Freelance Wrestling in September. Rae also managed to take part in IMPACT Wrestling's Bound For Glory pay-per-view, where she entered at #17 in the Call Your Shot Gauntlet Match.</p>
      <p>Following months of silence regarding her departure from AEW, Rae finally addressed the situation on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamkylierae/?hl=en">Instagram</a> account.</p>

      <p>Rae said it was a bit difficult to speak on the situation, but revealed that nobody forced her out of AEW and that it was her choice.</p>
      <blockquote>I can only speak for myself and what's in my heart. I don't know many rumors and honestly try to stay away from everything, obviously. But here: nobody made me leave. AEW took my career to new levels and I'm beyond grateful for every opportunity and experience that has come along the way and wish nothing but the best.</blockquote>
      <p>Rae took a closer look at herself, and realized that she needed to get everything right physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p>
      <blockquote>I needed to get my mind, body, and soul right with God. I wish I had the answers but the truth is I don't. We all go through obstacles in life and we may want all the answers but we don't need them. It's God's plan and he has shown me what's truly important in life and to find a blessing in every moment because in the blink of an eye, everything can be gone.</blockquote>
      <p>She finished up her statement with a message of positivity, hoping for everyone to learn to love one another.</p>
