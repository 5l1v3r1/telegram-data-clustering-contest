      <p>LOS ANGELES -- Celebrities often go big with their red carpet fashion, but Lizzo decided to go very, very tiny on the red carpet at the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>The "Truth Hurts" singer walked the carpet carrying a minuscule beige flap-style handbag that appeared to measure only an inch or so wide. Lizzo <a href="https://twitter.com/AMAs/status/1198744915569602560">said</a> the tiny purse was a custom Valentino creation, one of only three in existence, and joked that she squeezed a flask of tequila into the bag.</p>
      <p>Lizzo also wore a bright orange, one-shoulder ruffled dress and beige heels.</p>
      <p>One of the year's breakout stars, she's <a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/2019-american-music-awards-nominees-taylor-swift-could-set-new-record/5643893/">nominated for</a> New Artist of the Year, Favorite Female Artist - Soul/R&amp;B and Favorite Song - Soul/R&amp;B for "Juice." Her competition for New Artist of the Year includes Luke Combs, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Ella Mai.</p>
      <p>She's also set to perform during Sunday night's telecast on ABC.</p>
