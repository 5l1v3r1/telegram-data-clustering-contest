      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:01:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>A female acrobat was taken to hospital after falling during a performance at London's Winter Wonderland reportedly after slipping from her harness.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred at the Zippos Christmas Circus Show at 6pm, during a performance of Cirque Beserk.</p>
      <p>Staff rushed to help the artist,  Jackie Louise Armstrong, 35, after she didn't get up. The tent in Hyde Park was cleared of audience members. </p>
      <p>Ms Armstrong was taken to hospital but her condition is not known.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Zippos Circus said: "The female British artist, Jackie Armstrong, performs an aerial act and is a highly experienced circus artist with 10 years in the ring. </p>
      <p>"Jackie was immediately attended to on the scene by first aiders and an ambulance called. She was taken to hospital by ambulance and further information on the nature of her injuries is awaited."</p>
      <p>Following the incident, audience members were asked to leave the Big Top and offered tickets for the next performance that evening. </p>
      <p>Initial reports said that the acrobat fell 30ft but Zippos later said it was 12ft.</p>
      <p>Circus Founder and Director Martin Burton told MailOnline: "Jackie is a very experienced artist whom we value dearly as part of our circus family. </p>
      <p>"Clearly we are concerned and offering her and her family our full support and sympathy at this time.</p>
      <p>"At this stage we cannot comment further as we have no information on any injuries she may have sustained."</p>
