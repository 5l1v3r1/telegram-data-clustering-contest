      <p>I’m A Celebrity viewers are demanding justice for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> for being given ‘impossible’ task during today’s live trial.</p>
      <p>Eight of the celebrities were put to the test for a roast dinner on the live trial<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-merged-love-island-not-sure-feel-11212117/">, called Jungle </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> (complete with Ant and Dec getting texts and everything!).</p>
      <p>With 12 stars on the line for those in camp, the team were going strong until the last round.</p>
      <p>Lying on a bed filled with snakes, Roman and James were tasked with unscrewing stars from one side of the bed and rescrewing them on the other – with 90 seconds to get all three moved over.</p>
      <p>On top of the snakes already on the bed with them, each star was in a box filled with critters and animals including a snappy crab that caused havoc for James.</p>

      <p>Unable to complete the trial, a clearly annoyed James snapped at Ant and Dec when they asked him what went wrong.</p>

      <p>While normally most people vehemently defend the Geordie duo, this time they backed up rugby star Haskell, claiming it was impossible for the pair of them to complete the challenge in the allotted time slot.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec later defended the trial task, and said: ‘The stand ins did it when we tested it <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a>’ </p>
      <h3>Taking to Twitter, they demanded justice for the three stars who would now miss out on a roast dinner meal in camp tonight, after a week of meagre rations.</h3>

      <p>Tensions have clearly been running high in the Australian camp site, with food causing the celebs to get hangry as the day goes on.</p>

      <p>After a particularly tough day, the team were seen on a knife edge with Andrew Maxwell clashing with several members of the camp and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-ian-wright-and-james-haskell-clash-over-chivalry-of-all-things-11211775/">Kate Garraway clashing with Ian Wright and James over chivalry.</a></p>
      <p>Ian, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment were the three celebs whose stars for dinner weren’t successfully earned – which could be interesting when they return to camp.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle, Myles Stephenson, Kate Garraway and Andy weren’t present at the trial, instead heading off on a separate mission to get the group care packages from home.</p>
