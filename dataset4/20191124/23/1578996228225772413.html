      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:28:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:28</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Selena Gomez is back on her first award show red carpet of the year, and she dressed to make a statement for the occasion. The singer wore a strapless lime green Versace dress with her hair down in a bob and accessorized with a diamond necklace. Gomez will be performing her new music live for the first time since she released singles "Lose You to Love Me" and "Look at Her Now" last month.</p>

      <p>The American Music Awards have a lot of significance for Gomez. She performed "Wolves" and debuted platinum hair at the 2017 awards. Shortly after that, she switched back to brunette.</p>

      <p>But it was at the 2016 AMAs where she had one of her biggest award show moments ever. The ceremony was Gomez's first big event after she took time off in the summer and fall, and she gave a <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a40930/selena-gomez-ama-acceptance-speech-2016/">powerful speech</a> when she won Favorite Female Artist, telling the crowd, "if you are broken, you do not have to stay broken. And if that's anything, whether you respect me or not, that's one thing you need to know about me is that I care about people."</p>
      <p>Here, her full remarks from then:</p>
      <blockquote>In 2014, this stage was actually the first time that I was authentically 100 percent honest with all of you. I think it's safe to say that most of you know a lot of my life whether I liked it or not. And I had to stop. Because I had everything, and I was absolutely broken inside. And I kept it all together enough to where I would never let you down, but I kept it too much together to where I let myself down. I don't want to see your bodies on Instagram. I want to see what's in here. I'm not trying to get validation nor do I need it anymore. All I can say from the bottom of my heart is I am so grateful that I have to opportunity to be able to share what I love every single day with people that I love and I have to say thank you so much to my fans because you guys are so damn loyal and I don't know what I did to deserve you. But if you are broken, you do not have to stay broken. And if that's anything whether you respect me or not that's one thing you need to know about me is that I care about people. And thank you so much for this. This is for you, thank you.</blockquote>
