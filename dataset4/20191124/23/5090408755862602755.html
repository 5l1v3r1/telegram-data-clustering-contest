      <p>Washington Redskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins finally secured his first NFL victory in Week 12 of the season, but he wasn’t able to finish the game out to the final snap.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for both Haskins and the Redskins faithful, it wasn’t an injury that kept the former Ohio State great off the gridiron; it was a selfie.</p>
      <p>After leading Washington in a gutsy final drive to give his team the 19-16 lead, Haskins headed to the sideline to celebrate.</p>

      <p>Then, as the defense took over with just seconds remaining on the clock, the young quarterback headed towards the stands to take photos with fans. But the Redskins picked off Detroit Lions quarterback Jeff Driskel, forcing the offense to return to the field for one last play. When Washington’s coaching staff looked for Haskins to send him in for a victory formation, he was nowhere to be found.</p>

      <p>Instead, interim head coach Bill Callahan sent backup quarterback Case Keenum onto the field to take a knee. And even though some coaches likely would have found Haskin’s absence troubling, Callahan spoke about it lightheartedly during the postgame press conference.</p>
      <p>“We were looking for [Haskins]. We were looking for him, too,” Callahan said. “I think he thought the game was over. I think he thought it was over. So yeah, I’ll have to find out a little bit more.”</p>
      <p>For his part, Haskins said he was so excited that he didn’t realize the game was still in play.</p>
      <p>“I was so hype, I think I broke a water bottle,” Haskins said. “I look up and we’re in victory [formation]. I thought the game was over with already. But I’ll get it next time.”</p>
      <p>Haskins threw for 156 yards on 13 of 29 passing in Sunday’s affair to move the Redskins to 2-9 on the season.</p>
