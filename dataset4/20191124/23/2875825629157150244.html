      <h2>Mane was on target again in Liverpool's win over Crystal Palace on Saturday amid calls for the Senegalese forward to be awarded this year's Ballon D'Or</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a> believes improved composure is the key element that has seen <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/sadio-mane">Sadio Mane</a> become a world beater.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> forward has been in scintillating form for his team of late, having joint-won the Golden Boot last season, and topping the Reds' scoring charts so far in this campaign.</p>
      <p>His performances have got many tipping him to be a serious contender to win this years Ballon D'Or, including Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>“Sadio has been fantastic,” Robertson said.</p>
      <p>“Even when I came he was amazing, but maybe did not have as much composure as he does now in front of goal. Now every time he is there you don’t think he will miss.</p>

      <p>“The chance he had at the start of the second half, we were surprised he did not score, and that is the type of player he is. Then he has popped up with another crucial goal.</p>
      <p>“It has been a fantastic year for him and let’s hope he can keep going for a full season instead of a calendar year. He has taken his game to another level."</p>
      <p>Mane was on the scoresheet again on Saturday as he helped Liverpool to a 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>It was his eighth Premier League goal this season, and his 12th overall in 18 games.</p>

      <p>Robertson added: "For me, Sadio belongs in the top bracket in world football. People are finally giving him more credit and that is deserved.</p>
      <p>“Our front three get talked about a lot. Bobby does not score as many as the other two but his workrate is second to none and, if he did not do what he does, Sadio and Mo would not do what they do.”</p>
      <p>Firmino grabbed the all-important winner against Palace with just five minutes of normal time remaining, straight after their opponents had drawn level.</p>
      <p>And Robertson's fellow full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold believes Liverpool's constant knack of finding a goal when they need it most has shown their title credentials.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the club's <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374434-trent-alexander-arnold-reaction-crystal-palace">official website</a> , Alexander-Arnold said: "We have been showing that throughout the course of the season and even last season we showed how much of a good team spirit we have got and resilience.</p>
      <p>“We had a setback with their goal and we bounced back pretty much straight away. We showed our quality and went up the other end and scored.</p>
      <p>“That’s what good teams do, find a way to win, and that’s what we have done.”</p>
