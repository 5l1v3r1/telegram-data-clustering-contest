      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>Before taking a final call on the appointment of a new president for the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee, the Congress high command is likely to replace R.C. Khuntia who is currently in-charge of Telangana affairs.</p>
      <p>Sources in the Congress disclosed that the party is thinking of bringing a young and new face to look after party affairs in Telangana.</p>

Singh is a senior leader and Rajiv Satav is a Congress working committee (CWC) member, while Gaurav Gagoi is a young leader.</p>
      <p>After appointing one among the above as the Telangana in-charge, the party will likely take the opinion of the heads of the various party units in the state, as well the opinions of the district Congress presidents and senior leaders and then decide on the appointment of the new chief for Telangana.</p>

Sridhar Babu, MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and A. Revanth Reddy and former MP V. Hanumantha Rao. D. Sridhar Babu and Revanth Reddy are front-runners in the race.</p>
