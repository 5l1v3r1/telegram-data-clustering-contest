      <h1>Indian Café Criticized For Billing Customers Through Facial Scanning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:01:30+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Customers at a popular Indian cafe chain are unhappy that the company is using <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/biometrics/2019/biometrics-innovation-tests-consumer-privacy-sentiment/">facial recognition</a> software to bill its customers, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/tech/indian-cafe-chain-facial-recognition-scli-intl/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Nikhil Pahwa, an internet activist and founder of Indian media watchdog MediaNama, posted a video on Twitter last week showing the facial recognition in a Chaayos store in Delhi. It led other social media users to voice their own concerns over the technology’s use.</p>
      <p>“The scan began on its own. I had to tell the cashier I’m not interested in this, and he switched to a screen that asked for a phone number input. I declined that too,” Pahwa said, adding that he is concerned that the data is being collected without “proper consent.”</p>
      <p>“Systems like this that collect such personal and sensitive data, it normalizes it, and I’m really worried about that normalization,” he explained.</p>
      <p>Chaayos responded on Facebook, stating that it started its facial recognition feature to “reduce the overall customer purchase time.” The company said the technology is still in the testing stage.</p>
      <p>“At Chaayos, we are extremely conscious of our customer’s data security and privacy and are committed to protecting it,” the company wrote in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Chaayos/">statement</a>. “Data from the facial recognition feature is encrypted and cannot be accessed by any party, including Chaayos itself except for the purpose of logging-in to our customers. There is no third-party sharing of the data for any purpose. And Chaayos does not use or process this information for any other purpose. Moreover, customers have the right to not opt-in for facial recognition feature and instead use their phone number to enjoy the benefits of our loyalty program. Even providing phone number is not mandatory to enjoy a cup of chai or other products at Chaayos.”</p>
      <p>But as CNN pointed out, the terms and conditions of the chain’s loyalty program explain that customers “should not expect … personal information should always remain private.”</p>
