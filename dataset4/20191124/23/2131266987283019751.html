      <p>More than 70 disgruntled Tip Top staff are striking outside of the company's factory in south Auckland as part of negotiations for a pay rise and overtime rates, impacting bakery production.</p>
      <p>The strike began at 6:30pm on Saturday and will finish at 6:29pm on Monday, FIRST Union - which represents the striking workers - said.</p>
      <p>Mark Bosomworth, general manager of the baking division of George Weston Foods - which owns the Tip Top bakery brand - said as a result of the strike, production of buns, rolls, crumpets and gluten-free products is expected to be cut in half over the next two days, affecting supply in the North Island. </p>

      <p>"The strike action will reduce the company's production in Otahuhu and Wiri by roughly 50 percent, as more than 70 workers elect to strike.</p>
      <p>"Shoppers living in the region defined as Kapiti Coast to Wairarapa, and north to Kaitaia will see this impact reach supermarket shelves on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Through their Christchurch operation, [the company] is able to continue [its] supply of the majority of bakery products to Wellington and the South Island, so the impact [in those regions] will be minimal," Bosomworth added. </p>
      <p>FIRST Union spokesperson Anita Rosentreter said workers are striking due to the company's ongoing refusal to offer a "fair pay rise" and a "premium on overtime and night work."</p>
      <p>"The deal proposed by Tip Top would see the minimum wage overtake the bottom rate in the agreement. </p>
      <p>"George Weston Foods is using their employees' low pay against them: they know our members have to work 50 or more hours a week to make ends meet. </p>
      <p>"If they paid them more, they would be able to spend less time at work and more time at home with their families."</p>
      <p>Bosomworth said 14 of the union's 17 claims had been successfully resolved and that staff are treated fairly, and he was disappointed by the strike.</p>
      <p>"We are concerned that FIRST Union is talking about the details of the negotiation and making inaccurate and misleading claims, whilst we have [and will continue to] negotiate in good faith.</p>
      <p>"We pay competitive rates, we provide good training and we provide a safe, modern work environment for our staff," Bosomworth added.</p>
      <p>George Weston Foods is owned by Associated British Foods and manufactures well-known house-hold brands including Tip Top, Ploughmans, and Bürgen. Other bakery products manufactured by the company include Bürgen gluten-free, Golden crumpets, pikelets, bagels and muffins, Bazaar breads and the Speedibake range.</p>
      <p>People on the hunt for gluten-free bread are unlikely to be significantly affected.</p>
      <p>"Our Bürgen gluten-free Sunflower and Chia has been less impacted and we are doing our best to get back into full supply of the range," Bosomworth confirmed.</p>
      <p>Tip Top bakery staff striking on Monday are expected to resume work after strike action finishes at 6:29pm. Non-union staff will be redeployed to other roles within the bakery. </p>
