      <p>KOTA KINABALU, Malaysia: Thailand's Pavit Tangkamolprasert chipped-in for birdie on the second play-off hole on Sunday (Nov 24) to clinch the Sabah Masters, his second Asian Tour title.</p>
      <p>After closing with a final round 65, Pavit - who suffered a play-off defeat at the recent Thailand Open - redeemed himself in a four-way battle against compatriot Phachara Khongwatmai, Australian David Gleeson and Aman Raj of India.</p>

      <p>Pavit, 30, told reporters it had been an "unbelievable week".</p>
      <p>"It is the best chip in my life," he said of his hole out.</p>
      <p>Gleeson, who led after three rounds, could have wrapped up the tournament on the 72nd hole, but a costly bogey gave him a three-under 68.</p>
      <p>Phachara shot a final round 67 and Raj a blistering 63, with all the play-off contenders ending regulation play on matching totals of 13-under-par 271.</p>
      <p>In the first play-off hole - which was held on the par-four 18th - Raj bowed out with a bogey.</p>
