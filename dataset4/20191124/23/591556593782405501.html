      <p>LG Electronics has deployed a robot that can make and serve noodles at a South Korean family restaurant, the company has announced.  <br/><br/>Dubbed Cloi Chefbot, the robot will be installed at the noodle corner of the open kitchen area at CJ Foodville's Veep buffet restaurant in Deungchon, Seoul. <br/><br/>Customers can hand over a bowl with ingredients they selected to the robot. <br/><br/>Chefbot will then proceed to prepare noodles and gravy, and put it in the bowl for the customer to take back, LG said. The process takes about a minute.<br/><br/>The South Korean electronics said it carefully studied the movements of chef to develop a software that allows the robot to mimic their behaviour in motion, and not drop bowls or kitchen utensils. <br/><br/>The company said it hopes robots like Chefbot can take over dangerous or repetitive cooking duties in restaurants. <br/><br/>LG and CJ Foodville will install more Chefbots in the latter's venues and develop new ones going forward, they said.  <br/><br/>The pair <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-to-develop-robots-for-restaurants/">began collaborating in April </a>for the deployment. <br/><br/>Last week, LG also deployed <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-to-test-cloi-robots-in-childrens-hospital/">Cloi robots to a children hospital in Seoul</a> to assist with medical care. <br/><br/>The South Korean electronics giant <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-forms-robotics-autonomous-vehicles-divisions/">formed a new division in robotics</a> directly under the supervision of the CEO late last year to expand the business.</p>
      <p>Last week, LG was ordered by the Korea Consumer Agency to pay 100,000 won ($85) to each customers who bought its cloth dryers. The agency said the company misrepresented the dryers in their advertisements and the decision will affect up to 1.45 million units.  <br/><br/>LG has yet to respond and can appeal the decision.</p>
