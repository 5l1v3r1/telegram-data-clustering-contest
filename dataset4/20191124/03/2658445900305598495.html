      <p>Christians must play developmental politics built on good governance and responsive followership.</p>
      <p>This was the thrust at the annual political summit of the New Heritage Baptist Church Lagos last week.</p>
      <p>Speakers after speakers emphasised that Christians must never shy away from politics because it defines so much about their lives.</p>
      <p>The theme of the summit was After Election what next.</p>
      <p>Secretary of Transportation in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Hon Kayode Opeifa, described the much-talked #NotTooYoungToRun bill recently passed by the National Assembly as a fraud.</p>
      <p>He argued age has never been a barrier to holding political office in the country.</p>
      <p>He said elections are not won based on age but rather on active participation in political matters and antecedents built over a period of time.</p>
      <p>He advised youths to make themselves more visible in political matters if they must be taken serious</p>
      <p>“Nobody will yield power to you because you’re young. The fact is youths below the age of 30 have always played important roles in Nigeria’s political development, even before the bill was passed, so I don’t see what the noise is all about.</p>
      <p>“Most of us joined politics at very tender age and contributed our quota. It was quite an easy transition for us because even at the university, we were quite active.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t wait for older politicians to relinquish power because they also mentor us and saw our antecedents,” he added.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the Planning Committee of the summit, Deacon, Olufemi Aladjebi, said the New Heritage Baptist Church is a non-partisan church that encourages members to participate in politics and fulfill their civic obligations.</p>
      <p>H said the summit was to create awareness among church members, neighborhoods and Christians in generals so that they can participate in politics and make informed decisions on political matters.</p>

      <p>A former governorship aspirant in Lagos state, Jimi Agbaje, advised youths to engage more in digital activism as a way of bringing about the necessary change in political development.</p>
      <p>According to him, democracy is built on certain principles that include free and fair election, political tolerance rule of law, freedom of expression and the accountability of political office holders.</p>
      <p>He said these principles are still missing in the nation’s democratic system, urging youths to take advantage of the social media in bringing about the necessary change in the country’s political development.</p>
      <p>Minister of Youths and Sports, Sunday Dare, who was represented by Bashir Abiola-Are stated that the youths must play active roles in politics in deciding who gets what because of their huge population in the country.</p>
      <p>“For many of us who always think those in government are not good enough of delivering good services to the electorates, we must know from today that a person get the type of government they deserve as long as the professionals, the technocrats, the good men and women cede the political space to those we have terms professional politicians,” he said.</p>
      <p>Another speaker at the summit, Professor Oyelowo Oyewo, posited that the electorates must demand more for good governance from those they have elected into positions of authority.</p>
      <p>Oyewo, who is the Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice in Oyo state, argued that political affiliations should not stop the youths or the electorates from demanding for good governance.</p>
      <p>Dean, Faculty of Law, University of Lagos, Prof. Ayodele Atsenuwa, argued that more women should be given roles to play in Nigeria’s political development.</p>
      <p>According to her, with only eight senators out of 109 elected in the country, women are still being marginalised and must wake up from their slumber in other to be taken serious.</p>
