      <p>A Delhi court on Saturday stayed the release of movie based on former ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar.</p>
      <p>An application was filed by Chanda Kochhar, through her lawyers Vijay Aggarwal and Naman Joshi, based on which the court has put a stay on the release of a biopic which is reportedly based on her life. In her application, Chanda Kochhar claims that the film, purportedly based on her life, is an attempt to "vilify" her.</p>
      <p>Judge Sandeep Garg, Additional District Judge in New Delhi, passed an order on Saturday stating that all the defendants, which includes the producers and their associates agents representatives and all other actors, are restrained to use Chanda Kochhar's name directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p>The producers of the movie are also restrained from screening the movie online or offline.</p>
      <p>According to Vijay Aggarwal, Chanda Kochhar on November 20 discovered that an alleged biopic, titled as Chanda: A Signature That Ruined A Career, allegedly based on her life has been made. The lawyers of the complainant said the production house never approached Chanda Kochhar for her "consent" to make a film on her life.</p>
      <p>He said, "However, Chanda Kochhar was never approached by the concerend production house for her consent to use her name and make a film on her life. In the plaint it has also been alleged that the actress playing her role is openly speaking about how the film is about an alleged mistake made by the Plaintiff (Chanda Kochhar) and how it ruined her life."</p>
      <p>According to the application by Chanda Kochhar, the actress playing her role, in an interview, said that she has portrayed the style of walking, talking, body language, etc. of the former ICICI Bank CEO.</p>
      <p>Through the application, Chanda Kochhar had also raised strong objection to the title of the film. The complainant had questioned the underlying tone and tenor where she is being shown as a culprit though the trial which is pending.</p>
      <p>Chanda Kochhar is being probed by the ED and CBI for sanctioning six loans of Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon Group when she was the CEO of ICICI Bank between June 2009 and October 2011.</p>
      <p>Vijay Aggarwal said, "Making of such alleged biopics and their release as well as promotional interviews and material vilifying Chanda Kochhar are extremely prejudicial to the investigation as well as the trial."</p>
      <p>Actress Gurleen Chopra is playing the role of Chanda Kochhar in the biopic.</p>
