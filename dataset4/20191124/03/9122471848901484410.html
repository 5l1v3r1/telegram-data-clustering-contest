      <h1>Jim Harbaugh Has Major Praise For Michigan QB Shea Patterson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:28:47+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Michigan was knocked out of College Football Playoff contention pretty early on, with its bad loss to Wisconsin and close loss at Penn State. Since that trip to Happy Valley, Shea Patterson and the Wolverines have looked great.</p>
      <p>UM beat a very good Indiana team 39-14 today. Patterson had one of the best games of his college career, throwing for 366 yards and five touchdowns in the blowout win.</p>
      <p>Michigan has won four straight games by an average of 30.25 points. Patterson did will to manage a game played in brutal weather against Notre Dame, and didn’t need to do much against overmatched Maryland. In the last two games, though, he’s really turned it on.</p>
      <p>Against rival Michigan State last week, Patterson completed over 24-of-33 throws for 384 yards and four touchdowns. He’s had a QBR of over 90 in the last two games.</p>
      <p>After today’s game, Jim Harbaugh discussed just how good Shea Patterson has been as of late. From <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/michigan-football/jim-harbaugh-praises-shea-patterson-after-5-td-game-his-play-has-just-been-outstanding/">Saturday Tradition</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <span dir="auto">“We’re riding him,” Jim Harbaugh said. “His play has just been outstanding. He’s really seeing the field well. He is taking care of the football at all times, it’s even close to a turnover, he’s doing a great job in that regard and really playing good, disciplined football.<br/></span>
        <br/>
        <span dir="auto">[…]<br/></span>
        <br/>
        <span dir="auto">“He’s playing on time with everything that he does. Everything, all his rhythm, getting the ball out, everything has become very precise with Shea, with the receivers, with the tight ends, backs. The precision of the passing game has been operating extremely well.”<br/></span>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-wolverines/michigan-ohio-state-aidan-hutchinson-unbeatable">Michigan’s attention turns to Ohio State</a>, the No. 2 team in the country that looks bound for the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>When he transferred to Michigan from Ole Miss, fans probably expected Patterson to lead a more high-octane offense than what they’ve seen for most of the last few seasons. If he can lead the Wolverines to their first win over the Buckeyes since 2011, though, none of that will matter. He’ll go down in the Michigan history books.</p>
