        <b>How do I stop nonprofit organizations from sending letters asking for donations? </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Your kind consideration to stop these letters will be greatly appreciated. A.P. </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dear A.P.</b>: There is nothing you can do about letters being sent to you. Or even about phone calls soliciting money.</p>
      <p>Don’t waste your time with them. Throw away the letters, and hang up on the callers.</p>
      <p>I know it sounds rude, but it’s the only way to combat unsolicited requests for money.</p>
