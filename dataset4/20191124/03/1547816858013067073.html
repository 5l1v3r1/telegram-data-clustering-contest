      <p>Ayushmann is a bonafide star now, a thoroughly bankable actor who can be counted upon to shoulder a project on his own and also keep discovering the best films for audiences. He says, “While I have always believed in the concept of art for art's sake, I do realize that for an industry to thrive and grow, it is necessary that the films do really well. So, more than my personal milestones of 100 crore hits, I’m happy that I could contribute towards the growth of my industry as well as present some really good films to audiences in the process.”</p>

      <p>For Ayushmann, Bala has taken a very special place in his heart given the film’s positive messaging of self-love to society. He says, “Bala is a special film with important messages for the people of my country and so it’s really spectacular to see the love that audiences have showered on the film and me. I’m thrilled with the appreciation that the film has earned because I take a lot of time to hunt and curate the scripts that I feel is the best to convert into theatrical movies.” </p>
