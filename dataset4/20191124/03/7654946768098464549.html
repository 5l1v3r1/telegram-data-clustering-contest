      <p><b>Readers:</b> Here is the sixth lucky winner of the free $1,600 hearing aids <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/meet-the-winners-of-the-dear-john-hearing-aid-contest/">given out by Lively</a> (listenlively.com), a company that I challenged to prove its claim that its devices were fabulous at a lower price than its competitors’. The winners were selected randomly by Lively from people who emailed me and asked to be considered.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dear John: I am 83 years old, born April Fools Day 1933, and live in the East Village. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I’ve been using hearing aids over 20 years. I started with Dunshaw in late ’90s at 654 Madison. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In the last two years, it changed its name to I Love Hearing, and recently moved to 30 E. 60th St., Suite 605. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I live on Social Security, with little savings in a rent-stabilized apartment. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Every four years it costs me $7,000 for a new pair of hearing aids, and Social Security does not cover it. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I limit my use of the hearing aids to make them last longer. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Connecting with traumatized people and teaching the craft of acting to people of all ages for free is my major way of being of value in this world. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Free hearing aids would allow me more time with that. L.L. </b>
