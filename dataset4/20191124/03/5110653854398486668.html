      <h1>Yahoo DFS Picks Week 12: Daily fantasy football lineup advice for GPP tournaments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:31:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 is the perfect time to try out my preseason favorite Baker Mayfield in a Yahoo DFS tournament. It's not a secret that the Dolphins will be a solid matchup for the Browns, but a stack with Odell Beckham Jr. feels as good as it's gonna feel all season in this week. Considering that this daily fantasy football lineup construction still has room for Christian McCaffrey, and it feels like we're off to a good start.</p>
      <p>Last week, we took a shot on Ryan Finley. That's the pricing chance you sometimes have to take to finish high up in a tournament, and Finley was just 0.2% owned in the GPP I entered. Sadly, he stunk. We did right by our studs in Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara, but we didn't nail the cheap options to make it worthwhile. It's still a decent strategy if you choose to do it and pay down at QB. Next time, we'll just have to select a better one.</p>

      <h3>NFL DFS Week 12: Yahoo GPP Lineup Picks</h3>
      <p><b>QB Baker Mayfield, Browns vs. Dolphins ($29). </b>Mayfield managed two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown on Thursday night despite not looking all that awesome. If he's gonna look good in a game the rest of the way, it'll be at home against the Dolphins. I feel decent about those three total TDs repeating themselves.</p>

GPP</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB Christian McCaffrey, Panthers @ Saints ($40). </b>I felt comfortable enough with the rest of my choices to again pay up and grab McCaffrey, who's so overpoweringthat avoiding his point total could make our GPP lineup irrelevant.</p>
      <p><b>RB Devin Singletary, Bills vs. Broncos ($20). </b>Singletary continues to be the man in this backfield, and I'd expect the Bills to have a similar offensive outing against Denver as they did against Miami. If anything, they should lean on Singletary more against what is a better pass defense.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>WR Odell Beckham Jr., Browns vs. Dolphins ($22). </b>OBJ is priced less than Jarvis Landry, which isn't unfair but makes him the perfect stack with Mayfield. Beckham is more of an upside-laden GPP play, anyway.</p>
      <p><b>WR Hunter Renfrow, Raiders @ Jets ($18). </b>Renfrow's started to get consistent targets in Oakland, and I'm attacking this game with two of my wide receiver picks. Renfrow doesn't feel like a tournament play, but Derek Carr looks his way around the end zone enough to give him a decent floor/ceiling combo.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>WR Robby Anderson, Jets vs. Raiders ($15). </b>Anderson finally returned to the end zone in Week 11, and Oakland's defense is susceptible to the deep ball. With how Sam Darnold and the New York offense is clicking, expect Anderson to get free deep at least once.</p>
      <p><b>TE Jacob Hollister, Seahawks @ Eagles ($18). </b>People might forget about Hollister coming off his bye or think his price is a little high, but it's totally warranted. He should see six-plus targets and have a great shot of scoring in a game that Seattle should have plenty of success through the air.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>FLEX DJ Chark, Jaguars @ Titans ($21). </b>This isn't some great matchup or anything -- it's just that Chark always seems to tick no matter how good or bad the Jacksonville offense looks. And for such a consistent player, he also has a high ceiling, as his two touchdowns in Week 11 reminded us yet again.</p>
      <p><b>D/ST Buffalo Bills vs. Broncos ($16). </b>Brandon Allen isn't very good, and the Bills should shut down Courtland Sutton with Tre'Davious White and limit Noah Fant via one of the best team defenses at limiting tight ends. Take away a bad QB's best two receiving weapons and it could be a rough day for the Denver offense.</p>
