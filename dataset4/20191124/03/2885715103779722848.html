      <h1>IFFI uploads Gulzar pic instead of Satyajit Ray in film credit, rectifies later</h1>

      <p>In a goof up, the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) attached veteran lyricist-poet Gulzar’s picture instead of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s in the director’s biography of Ganashatru on its official website.</p>
      <p>The screenshot of the webpage of the homage section of IFFI website, featuring Gulzar’s picture as the director of the 1989 Bengali film went viral on social media on Friday.</p>
      <p>However, soon after reports of the mix up started doing the rounds, the festival organisers rectified the mistake.</p>
      <p>The 50th edition of IFFI started on November 20, with megastar <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/amitabh-bachchan/">Amitabh Bachchan</a> and south superstar <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a> attending the opening ceremony.</p>
