      <p><b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/justin_timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a></b> is making headlines... but not for the reasons you might think.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, photos circulated online of the 38-year-old actor appearing to get cozy and flirty with his <i>Palmer</i> co-star, <b>Alisha Wainwright</b>. According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10409561/justin-timberlake-holds-hands-alisha-wainwright-strokes-knee-boozy/"><i>The Sun</i></a>, who first reported the news and obtained pictures and video, the co-stars were seen taking a break from filming and hanging out at a New Orleans bar late at night.</p>
      <p>Images that were captured of their outing showed the 30-year-old actress placing her hands on Timberlake's knee. Moreover, they were seen touching each other and holding hands at one point. But despite what the candid photos look like, a source tells E! News that "there is absolutely nothing going on between them."</p>
      <p>"They were out with all the cast, crew, makeup artists, and everyone was just hanging out in a social setting," the insider shared with us. "They are just working together. No validity to any other rumor other than that they are filming together."</p>

      <p>A second source, who is close to the situation, also shares the same sentiments as the first insider, and reiterates that their hangout was simply "innocent."</p>
      <p>"They're filming a movie together and it was a group of people hanging out," the second source shared. "There is nothing going on between them."</p>
      <p>At this time, neither Timberlake or Wainwright have yet to addresses the rumors floating around about their recent outing.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old actor and singer is currently married to <b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/jessica_biel">Jessica Biel</a></b>. The longtime couple tied the knot in October 2012 and share a four-year-old son together, <b>Silas</b>.</p>
      <p>In fact, the pair recently made hearts swoon when <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1086658/justin-timberlake-and-jessica-biel-may-have-won-halloween-again">the actress dressed up as her husband for Halloween</a>. The two lovebirds attended the Casamigos Tequila Halloween Party in Beverly Hills for the first time. Making their debut even more epic, the 37-year-old star channeled Justin from his <b>*NSYNC</b> days and totally nailed the look.</p>
