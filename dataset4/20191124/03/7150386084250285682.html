      <h3>Dream11 Tips And Predictions</h3>
      <p>Dream11 Team Prediction Karnataka vs Punjab Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019-20 – Cricket Tips For Today’s T20 Match, Super League, Group B Match KAR vs PUN at Surat: In the Group-B Super League match of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019, table-toppers Karnataka will take on second-placed Punjab in a riveting encounter. Bolstered with the return of supremely talented Shubman Gill, Punjab will look to make the most of the opportunity. They have won their previous game by a comfortable margin of 109 runs. Abishek Sharma, Mandeep Singh were the top performers with the bat and Markande was the star with the ball for Punjab.</p>
