      <p>KOLKATA: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cheteshwar-Pujara">Cheteshwar Pujara</a> heaped praise on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>, who tormented Bangladesh in both their innings at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>. "Ishant has worked on the swingâ€¦ he has always got considerable movement bowling against left-handers, but now he is doing so against righthanders too," the India No. 3 said at the post-match conference.</p>
      <p>Ishant, who bagged 5/22 in the first innings, added four more in the second to push the visitors to the brink of a second successive innings defeat. Pujara feels the kind of swing Ishant is generating now has made him lethal. "It's very different facing him now," he added.</p>
      <p>Pujara also hailed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>'s 27th Test hundred. "He batted really well. He has been scoring a lot of runs in all formats. I am sure he will cherish this pink-ball ton."</p>
      <p>On the difficulties of batting under lights, Pujara said, "It is difficult as the ball swings a little more under lights. The first session was easier to bat and then again the last session is easy. We have played most of the Tests in daylight, so this is a whole new challenge."</p>
      <p>Asked if the declaration came a bit earlier than expected, Pujara said: "I think that was the right time to bowl to Bangladesh as the ball was swinging and we felt that we could pick up wickets and that is what happened."</p>
      <p>Pujara blamed the light and pink ball for so many Bangladesh batsmen getting hit on the head. "I thought the light and pink ball had a role to play. As a batsman, it is especially difficult to pick short balls. Their batters haven't even played any first-class match with pink ball, so it's not easy," Pujara opined.</p>
      <p>Pujara believes that India will have to play many more matches to get used to the pink ball under lights. "If we are going to play more pink ball Tests, we will have to practice more under lights and start getting used to conditions," he said.</p>
      <p><b>Concussion update: </b>After Bangladesh were forced to take two concussion substitutes on the opening day, two more batsmen - Mohammad Mithun and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mushfiqur-Rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> - were hit on the head in the second innings on Saturday. The team management informed that neither showed any sign of concussion.</p>
