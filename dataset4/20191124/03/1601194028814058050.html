      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/luchasaurus">Luchasaurus</a> has always been very clear that he doesn't take insults about dinosaurs lightly, considering that he barrages the likes of Barney and others for sullying the good name of 'his species'.</p>
      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/braun-strowman">Braun Strowman</a> <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/braun-strowman-takes-a-dig-at-aew-s-luchasaurus">took a shot</a> at Luchasaurus by referring to him as a 'Dork in a dragon mask.' Not to let anything go, Luchasaurus shrugged off the comment and responded by saying, "Wow... I havenâ€™t heard the dragon insult since the Middle Ages".</p>

      <p>Luchasaurus is certainly the most over 'big man' in AEW. He captivates crowds everywhere he goes and has been wonderfully paired with Jungle Boy and Marko Stunt. AEW has been pushing the group hard and even released a mock 'wild life documentary' on the group.</p>

      <p>On the other side of the pond, Braun Strowman is set to be in a 5-on-5-on-5 match representing Team SmackDown alongside Roman Reigns, King Corbin, Shorty G and Mustafa Ali at Survivor Series 2019. The other two are Team Raw (Seth Rollins, Randy Orton, Kevin Owens, Ricochet and Drew McIntyre) and Team NXT (TBA).</p>
      <p>Would a match between the two happen in the future? While it's highly unlikely, in the world of professional wrestling, anything is possible.</p>
