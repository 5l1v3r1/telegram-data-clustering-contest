      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy TE Rankings: Ryan Griffin, Jacob Hollister among top sleepers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:41:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:41</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>The most interesting storylines in our Week 12 fantasy TE rankings might involve players who could miss action this week. We know fantasy football owners will be without Travis Kelce and Hunter Henry due to Week 12 byes. We'll also be on George Kittle watch all week to see if he makes it back from his knee injury or lets Ross Dwelley keep balling out for San Francisco. Evan Engram, too, has a foot injury that could keep him out. If you're keeping score at home, that's four of the top-five or six TEs that might miss action this week (Oh yeah, and Austin Hooper is still out, too).</p>
      <p>At a position that hasn't been regarded as deep all season, it will feel especially shallow in Week 12. All the better reason to invest heavily in Jacob Hollister on your waiver wire coming off his Week 11 byeafter he had three scores in the two weeks prior to go with consistent targets.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We'd love to be able to recommend one of Hooper's replacements in Atlanta, either Jaeden Graham or Luke Stocker. With the Cardinals on bye this week, the Falcons' opponent, Tampa Bay, is the best defense to attack for fantasy TE purposes. But Graham and Stocker combined for three targets in Week 11 and just don't look featured enough to really want to use either of them. If you're really desperate, Graham seems the more talented receiver of the duo.</p>

      <p>You can potentially take advantage of Ryan Griffin's recent production and relatively low ownership heading into a matchup with Oakland. The same is true for Tyler Eifert as the Bengals take on the Steelers. Sticking with the veterans theme, Pats' TE Benjamin Watson also has a fantasy-friendly matchup against the Cowboys in Week 12.</p>

He's an auto-start if he plays, but if he's out, Ross Dwelley should start in fantasy leagues. Dwelley caught two touchdowns in Week 11, and Green Bay allows the fourth-most fantasy points to tight ends. </td>

With Oakland's third-worst defense against TEs coming to town, you can count on Griffin to put up solid numbers once again.</td>

He finished with 10 catches on 14 targets and, if indications are his role will stay big, could be looking at a solid output against a bad Falcons' pass defense.</td>
