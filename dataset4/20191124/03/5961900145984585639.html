      <h1>Shane Dawson Serves You The Tea You Crave, Puts James Charles Drama In Series Finale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:15:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:15</time> by <a rel="author">By PEDESTRIAN.TV</a></address>
      <p>Two weeks after <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/shane-dawson-james-charles-documentary-series/">backtracking on the “dramageddon” episode</a> and ultimately expressing his desire to completely remove <b>James Charles</b> from the docuseries, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9_KinVpV-snHe3C3n1hvA"><b>Shane Dawson</b></a> has appeased his fans’ thirsty desire for tea by briefly including the Charles/<b>Tati Westbrook</b>/<b>Jeffree Star</b> debacle in the series finale.</p>
      <p><i>The Beautiful World of Shane Dawson</i>, which dropped yesterday and is currently the #1 trending YouTube video on the planet, spends the first 10 minutes briefly recounting the scandal. It’s mostly footage of Shane and his partner <b>Ryland Adams</b> watching the takedown videos in disbelief, followed by Shane expressing concern at how ferocious James attempted-cancellation is.</p>
      <p>Instead of the episode going into detail about the whole thing, we follow Shane’s internal debate as he wrestles with the idea of using the ‘dramageddon’ footage at all.</p>
      <p>This mirrors his Instagram Live session a couple weeks back, in which he came to the realisation that rehashing old YouTube drama felt unnecessary for the series.”I don’t want to leave people feeling weird… because I feel weird. I should have never put the drama in the trailer.”</p>
      <p>In all fairness, <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/shane-dawson-james-charles-documentary-series/">after teasing ‘dramageddon’ in the series trailer</a>, Shane didn’t really have a choice <i>but</i> to include it – viewers would have accused him of clickbait otherwise. That being said, all subsequent mentions of James and Tati in the episode are pretty damn tasteful.</p>
      <p>Anyway, Shane took to Twitter after the episode’s release to express his gratitude.</p>

      <p>The episode itself is a rollercoaster of anxiety, as it primarily recounts the clusterfuck that was the palette’s online release. Check out the series finale below.</p>
