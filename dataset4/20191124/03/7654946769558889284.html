      <p>The former FBI lawyer accused of altering crucial documents in the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign is the same official who praised “the Resistance” in an anti-Trump text message in 2016, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Kevin Clinesmith, who worked for ousted FBI agent Peter Strzok in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe, made significant additions to an email that was included in an application to renew a surveillance order against Trump aide Carter Page, The New York Times reported.</p>
      <p>Clinesmith, identified as “FBI Attorney 2,” also appeared in a 2018 Inspector General’s report as the author of a string of texts lamenting Trump’s election, according to the Daily Caller.</p>
      <p>“I am so stressed about what I could have done differently,” he wrote Nov. 9, hours after Trump’s victory. “Viva la Resistance!” he texted on Nov. 22.</p>
