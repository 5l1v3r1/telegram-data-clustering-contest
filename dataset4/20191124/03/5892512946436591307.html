      <h1>Mark Hunt goes off on UFC, Dana White after lawsuit dismissed: ‘Someone’s going to put you motherf—kers down!’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:25:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:25</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Mark Hunt’s <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/6/2/15733530/mark-hunts-lawsuit-passes-ufc-motion-to-dismiss-team-files-amended-complaint-in-u-s-district-court">lawsuit</a> against Ultimate Fighting Champion (UFC), Dana White, and WWE superstar Brock Lesnar is no more, according to a judge at a U.S. district court in Nevada.</p>
      <p>Hunt has been trying to bring the promotion, White, and Lesnar all to justice for allegedly conspiring to avoid drug testing rules back at UFC 200 to allow Lesnar to fight Hunt on short notice. The two fought, Lesnar won, ended up <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2016/7/19/12230928/brock-lesnar-in-competition-drug-test-comes-back-positive-for-ufc-200-mma">testing positive for a banned substance</a>, and Hunt soon after demanded that Lesnar’s <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2016/7/16/12206446/mark-hunt-now-wants-all-of-brock-lesnars-ufc-200-fight-purse-says-wwe">entire $2.5 million paycheck</a> should be his. Hunt, of course, then brought about the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/2/15/18226753/majority-of-mark-hunts-lawsuit-against-ufc-gets-dismissed-lesnar-white-mma-200">most of Hunt’s case was dismissed</a> earlier this year, “Super Samoan” was still seeking word on a charge of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Now that Hunt got the opposite answer he was hoping for, the MMA veteran is letting the whole combat community feel his frustration.</p>

      <p>Hunt, 45, hasn’t fought in UFC since a loss to Justin Willis back in December of last year. In fact, Hunt has lost four of his last five Octagon appearances, all coming after his eventual no contest against Lesnar at UFC 200 back in 2016. The former PRIDE standout has already talked about <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/2/9/16997946/mark-hunt-leaving-ufc-after-contract-expires-plans-to-fight-globally-before-retirement-mma-perth">fighting outside of UFC</a> to test his aging skills globally, so fight fans don’t really know if “Super Samoan” will ever step foot back inside of the Octagon.</p>
      <p>Even if he wanted to the the promotion may not want him back, especially after this heated lawsuit.</p>
      <p>What do you think, Maniacs? Did Hunt get hosed?</p>
