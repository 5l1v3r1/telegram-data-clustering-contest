      <p>TORONTO -- A Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfan is celebrating her 90th birthday by watching her favourite team take on the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at the 107th Grey Cup championship on Sunday.</p>
      <p>June Figsby has cheered for her home team since she was in high school in the 1940s. </p>
      <p>“I’ve been a fan since 1945 and win or lose, they’re still my team and I keep cheering,” she told CTV News.</p>
      <p>Joanne Basson, Figsby’s daughter, bought the Grey Cup tickets as a birthday gift for her mom.</p>
      <p>“I know she’s been a fan for so many years,” said Basson. “I was born into it, so I’m a huge fan too.”</p>
      <p>Decked out from head to toe in blue-and-gold Bombers gear, the pair are in Calgary this weekend hoping to see the team end a nearly 30-year dry spell.</p>
      <p>The last championship the Bombers won was in 1990, beating the Edmonton Eskimos during the 78th Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>“Not seeing the Grey Cup in Winnipeg has been really tough,” said Figsby.</p>
      <p>Fans of the Tiger-Cats are also eager for a victory. The last time the team won a championship was 20 years ago when they beat the Calgary Stampeders in the 87th Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>“In my head I’m already holding the cup with the team,” said Tiger-Cats fan Jason Adams.</p>
      <p>Country star Keith Urban will headline the halftime show. Though Urban admitted Saturday that he’s never seen a CFL game before, he said he’s looking forward to watching alongside fans. </p>
      <p>“What a crash course right? To come and see the Grey Cup,” said the four-time Grammy winner.</p>
      <p>Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. ET at Calgary’s McMahon Stadium.</p>
