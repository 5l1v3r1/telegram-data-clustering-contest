      <p>CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - State lawmakers are working to improve safety at school bus stops after parents in Charleston County voiced their concerns for drivers passing by busses.</p>
      <p>South Carolina state representative Lin Bennett filed a bill this week that would increase fines, license suspensions and even potential jail time for people who violate stop signs on buses.</p>
      <p>“The ultimate goal is to get people to realize how dangerous this is, how bad this is,” Bennett said. “If you can’t do something as simple as stopping for a stopped school bus, you need to pay for that and you don’t need to be driving.”</p>
      <p>First-time offenders passing stopped school buses would have to pay a minimum fine of $1,000 and have their license suspended for thirty days.</p>
      <p>A second conviction increases the minimum fine to $5,000 and six months in jail.</p>
      <p>For more than a year, Erica Cokley has filmed cars driving by her children’s bus on Johns island. She said she wants people to be aware of the growing concern among parents.</p>
      <p>“It’s been years, I mean, these are our children,” Cokley said. “If it’s happening just right there, then you can best believe that it’s happening everywhere.”</p>
      <p>A survey by the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services found that more than 95,000 people across 39 states didn’t stop for school buses on a single day. That number increased from 84,000 last year.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just across our state, but across our country,” Bennett said. “It just seems to be a trending, bad situation.”</p>
      <p>For parents like Cokley, she says the bill is a step in the right direction</p>
      <p>“It makes me feel like I’ve finally been heard,” Cokley said. “If you have to go that far to have a representative get involved, then that means that somebody’s finally listening.”</p>
