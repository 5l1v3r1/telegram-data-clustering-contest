      <p>Gravitas Ventures has acquired North American rights to “Red Dog,” Oklahoma native Luke Dick's autobiographical film about his mother Kim raising him at OKC’s infamous topless bar, the Red Dog Saloon, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/fred-wolf-love-40-director-1203409824/">according to Variety</a>.</p>
      <p>Variety reports that the documentary will be available on demand on Jan. 7.</p>
      <p>"Red Dog," which premiered at 2019 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, was directed by Dick and his longtime collaborator Casey Pinkston.</p>
      <p><a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5634004/deadcenter-film-festival-2019-attracts-35000-attendees-makes-5.5-million-economic-impact-names-winners">As previously reported</a>, Dick, a singer and songwriter who has penned songs for country stars Miranda Lambert, Eric Church and Kacey Musgraves, also proved to be the biggest star at his hometown deadCenter Film Festival in Oklahoma City, selling out both screenings of “Red Dog” and lighting up the Friday Night Frolic at Dunlap Codding with his rock band, Republican Hair (<a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5643272/oklahoma-native-luke-dicks-band-republican-hair-changes-its-name-to-steve">which has since been rennamed Steve</a>). Dick’s autobiographical movie was both an audience and critical favorite, winning the Special Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature.</p>
      <p>Dick spent his early childhood years in the Red Dog, where his mom, Kim, started stripping as a teenager with a fake ID. It’s where she met and married his dad, one of the regulars, and not long after the future songwriter to the country stars was born, his dad left his mom. So, she went back to work at the Red Dog, where the strippers, bartenders and bouncers became Dick’s first family.</p>
      <p>“The crazy stories were so crazy that I found them interesting and wanted to know more about them, but of course, the further you get down into something, to me, to maintain my interest – and I feel like to maintain the interest of human beings in general – there has to be a pathos involved,” Dick, a former adjunct philosophy professor, told me <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5633365/interview-songwriterfilmmaker-luke-dick-brings-documentary-red-dog-home-to-okcs-deadcenter-film-festival">in a summer interview.</a></p>
      <p>“It’s not like I had to sit around and create reality television to find the pathos in it. It’s like mothers and sons and families and divorces and what you do in the face of young, crazy adversity. And parenthood. These are all things that anyone can identify with. … Crazy stories are really fun, too. But it’s not enough to me to warrant making … a 100-minute film. At some point you have to ask yourself, ‘Is it worth making?’ and when it comes to something requiring 100 minutes of someone’s time, I feel like there has to be some pathos involved.”</p>
