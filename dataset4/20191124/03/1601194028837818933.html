      <p>When NXT hosts one of their TakeOver events, they are usually some of the best events of the year. NXT TakeOver: WarGames has always been one of the most awaited events of the year for the Black and Yellow brand.</p>
      <p>This year was no different, as from the start to the finish, there was match-after-match, filled with moment after moment, that could be argued to be some of the best of the year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> TakeOver was one of the best of the year and saw a heel turn, a former WWE main roster Superstar return to TakeOvers successfully for the first time since 2016, a title contender for Survivor Series determined, incredible odds overcome by an underdog team, and a crazy main event that shortened everyone's career.</p>
      <p>This TakeOver had a little bit of everything, for every person who watched it. Welcome to the Best and Worst, WarGames edition. Without any further ado, let's take a look at the best and the worst moments from the night.</p>

      <h3>#5 Best: Finn Balor is Prince Devitt</h3>

      <p>Let's get this clear right away. On this TakeOver: WarGames, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/finn-balor">Finn Balor</a> clearly showcased why he was underrated when he was on the main roster. Taking on a big name like Matt Riddle, he did not have an easy time getting back on the first NXT TakeOver that he was a part of since 2016 when he went to the main roster.</p>
      <p>While Balor had his work cut out for him, it was the only slow match that built up the match with a slow burn and it worked. The contrast with the rest of the matches helped to set it apart, making sure that the fans had the time to appreciate each moment of the match and not just a spot-fest. The technical brilliance put on display by both wrestlers in the match was reminiscent of a match from back in the day.</p>
      <p>Finn Balor cemented his name as the victor followed by an excellent 1916 DDT to pick up the win. When Johnny Gargano finally returns from injury, that's going to be quite the feud to look out for.</p>
