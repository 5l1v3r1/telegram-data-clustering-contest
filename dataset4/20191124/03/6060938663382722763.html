      <h1>Box office update: 'Frozen 2' is set for a strong weekend while 'Pagalpanti' sees a limited growth</h1>

      <p>Anees Bazmee's multi starrer comedy entertainer '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pagalpanti">Pagalpanti</a>' has been the talk of the town for quite a while now. The film which features John Abraham, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ileana-D-Cruz">Ileana D'Cruz</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anil-Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pulkit-Samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Kharbanda">Kriti Kharbanda</a> in lead roles has finally got released on Friday.</p>
      <p>However, the film opened to mixed reviews and has taken a poor start at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/box-office">box office</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the latest report of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Box-Office-India">Box Office India</a>, The John Abraham- <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ileana-D-Cruz">Ileana D'cruz</a> starrer showed limited growth of around 25% to collect Rs.6.25 crore nett on day two which is not adequate for the film due to the poor start.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the highly anticipated sequel of Frozen has garnered a good business on the first day.</p>
      <p>The report further added that the adventure of Elsa and Anna is all set for a strong weekend as it garnered a good collection of Rs.7 crore nett on Saturday. The film has surpassed 'Pagalpanti' on day two and stands at Rs.10.25 crore nett approx in two days.</p>
      <p>There is a big jump across multiplexes in all the major cities. However, this film is mainly for kids therefore weekend growth was expected. Weekday collections will tell whether the film will go on become a huge success or not. If weekdays score is great then it could put a very good lifetime total.</p>
