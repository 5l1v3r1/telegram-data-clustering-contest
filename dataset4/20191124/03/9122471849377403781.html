      <h1>Manny Diaz Is Getting Crushed For Miami’s Embarrassing Loss Tonight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:48:31+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Manny Diaz is just in his first season as the head coach of the Miami Hurricanes’ program, but he might already be on the hot seat in South Florida after tonight’s performance.</p>
      <p>Miami has been upset by FIU. The Hurricanes fell to the Panthers, 30-24, on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Diaz, 45, took over the program when Mark Richt retired this past offseason. He was originally hired by Temple, but left the Owls for the job with the Hurricanes.</p>
      <p>Could Diaz already be on his way out?</p>
      <p>Some fans are calling for it.</p>
      <p>“Losing to FIU doesn’t necessarily put Manny Diaz job on the line. But it should because that is unacceptable,” one fan tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Go ahead and fire Manny Diaz again,” another fan tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Manny Diaz needs to be fired, you can lose to Florida and these other ACC teams but you just can’t lose to FIU,” one added.</p>
      <p>Diaz probably will not be fired after just one season, but he’ll likely head into the 2020 campaign with a serious hot seat.</p>
