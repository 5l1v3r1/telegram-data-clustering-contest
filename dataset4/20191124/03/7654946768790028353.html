      <h1>E-tailers turning to mall space as former mall merchants die</h1>

      <p>Reports of the death of the American mall are greatly exaggerated.</p>
      <p>While brick-and-mortar mall merchants such as Payless, Sears and Family Dollar <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/17/why-some-shops-succeed-while-others-struggle-to-stay-afloat/">are dying at a record pace</a>, more online brands are rushing to sell their wares in the glare of floodlights and the hum of cash registers. More than 1,700 physical US stores started off as digital merchants, according to Fifth Wall and Thinknum Alternative Data.</p>
      <p>The group <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/05/05/madison-avenue-gets-less-stuffy-with-new-menswear-shops/">includes New York’s UNTUCKit</a>, which metamorphosed from an online men’s apparel retailer into a global brand, with its 86th store opening soon in Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>“Opening in a mall is great for our brand because the customer gets a much stickier experience, and your long-term value grows,” UNTUCKit founder Chris Riccobono told The Post. “Malls are going to become more exciting as some of the old retail guard clears out, and the new guard moves in.”</p>
      <p>In another nod to old-fashioned shopping, Taft, the upscale online men’s footwear brand — boasting a following of over 500,000 on Instagram — last week announced the opening of its first flagship store on Prince Street in Soho.</p>
      <p>“Brick-and-mortar retail isn’t dying, it’s evolving,” said Sharon Lim, CEO of Browzwear, a Singapore-based apparel designer with a large footprint in the US.</p>
      <p>“When we launched in 2011, the buzz was that brick and mortar would be gone completely at some point in time,” said UNTUCKit’s Riccobono. “But we quickly realized from our customers that this was never going to be the case. A large percentage will simply not buy until they get to touch and feel the product in the stores.”</p>
