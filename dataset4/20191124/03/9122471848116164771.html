      <h1>Upset Alert: No. 6 Oregon Is In Trouble Tonight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:06:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>No. 6 Oregon is the Pac-12’s College Football Playoff hopeful. But the Ducks are in serious jeopardy of being eliminated from playoff contention.</p>
      <p>Arizona State has put together a brilliant game-plan, keeping the Ducks’ defense on its heels en route to a 13-7 lead in the third quarter. The Sun Devils don’t look like a team that’s lost four straight games.</p>
      <p>As for the Ducks, they’ve been able to run the football effectively as RB CJ Verdell has 15 carries for 85 yards so far. But questionable play-calling has killed any momentum Oregon has garnered.</p>
      <p>QB Justin Herbert has had a horrible night thus far. Oregon’s signal-caller has completed 10-of-20 passes for 127 yards. He hasn’t thrown any picks yet, but he’s made plenty of questionable decisions resulting in near-turnovers.</p>
      <p>This is one of the first times all season Herbert and this Oregon offense has been unable to find a spark. The Ducks might eliminate themselves from a potential CFP selection if they can’t mount a late comeback.</p>

      <p>ASU QB Jayden Daniels is playing beyond his years tonight. The freshman QB has nearly 300 passing yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Can Herbert find a groove and get the offense going? Or will the Sun Devils spoils Oregon’s post-season aspirations?</p>
