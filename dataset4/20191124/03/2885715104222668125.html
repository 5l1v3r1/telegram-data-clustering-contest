      <p>The wet spell in Chennai is likely to continue for the next few days as more rainfall is expected, the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) said.</p>
      <p>The RMC said that Chennai, districts in coastal Tamil Nadu and parts of neighbouring Puducherry will receive moderate to heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms from Monday due to an easterly trough in Tamil Nadu. Districts in southern Tamil Nadu are expected to receive more rainfall than the northern region of the State.</p>
      <p>A heavy rainfall warning has been issued to the districts of Ramanathapuram, Kanyakumari, Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli from Monday.</p>
