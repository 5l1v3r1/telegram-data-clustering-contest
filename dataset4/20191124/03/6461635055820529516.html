      <h3>Gerard Pique responds to critics after Barcelona’s win against Leganes, insisting he is not distracted by his commitments towards his global investment company, Kosmos.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was once again under criticism due to his poor performances in the back, the Spaniard has struggled to keep up with the pace of his opponents and many critics blame his commitment towards his endeavors away from the sport. The Spanish international has been traveling regularly to Madrid this week to attend the Davis Cup which Pique and co.  transformed into a ‘world cup style’ format.</p>
      <p>Barcelona struggled in their away fixture against Leganes, barely doing enough to escape with a victory. Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal scored the team’s two goals in the 2-1 win over the relegation side. Ernesto Valverde’s side continues to struggle to find consistency, despite remaining at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Pique insisted after the win that his trips to the Spanish capital have not affected his performance and that he and coach Valverde are on good terms.</p>
      <blockquote>“The journeys take 40 minutes, I’m just getting all this attention for who I am and what I represent. I try to do things in a simple way and the criticism is not serious, but people are allowed to think what they want, but respect me”<br/><br/>“I had a friendly conversation with the coach about my plans and how we were going to manage it, I have a phenomenal relationship with the coach and with the club, all this noise is coming from outside,”<br/><br/>Source <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-spain-leg-fcb/pique-defends-davis-cup-commitments-after-scrappy-barca-victory-idUKKBN1XX0J3?rpc=401&amp;"><b>Reuters</b></a></blockquote>
      <p>The player also stated that he will continue with his endeavors beyond football but insists that his focus remains in Barcelona and doing his best for the club.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m staying in Madrid to watch the Davis Cup semi-finals. What you do off the pitch is your business, my only job is to play well and do as well as possible.”</blockquote>
      <p>Pique was one of the worst performers in the Saturday’s fixture against Leganes and will also miss out on the club’s next match in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Do you believe Gerard Pique’s responsibilities beyond football are distracting him?</p>
