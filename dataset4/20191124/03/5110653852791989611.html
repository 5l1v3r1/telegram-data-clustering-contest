      <h1>Week 12 PPR Rankings: WR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:48:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:48</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>There are plenty of wide receiver injuries (JuJu Smith-Schuster, Tyler Lockett, T.Y. Hilton, Will Fuller, Alshon Jeffery, Brandin Cooks, etc.), bye weeks (Cardinals, Chargers, Chiefs, Vikings), shaky QBs, and bad matchups to worry about, but before we really get into our Week 12 fantasy WR PPR rankings, let's take a moment to point out some positives.</p>
      <p>For starters, owning Michael Thomas in a PPR league is really unfair. He has 19 more receptions than any other wideout and 32 more catches than the three WRs who rank tied for fifth in that statistic. He's an absolute machine, regardless of who his QB is and who he's facing.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Also, we have to credit to two "deep threats" who are racking up receptions at much more steady rates this year: John Brown and Marvin Jones. Brown is nine receptions away from tying his previous career high for catches in a season (65), and Jones' catch percentage has improved this year to 76 percent, which is over 20 percentage points higher than last season and over 12 percent higher than his previous career best. Both are in the top 17 for receptions by wide receivers this year. Lockett is another "big-play" receiver who has become a valuable PPR guy, ranking tied for fifth in WR catches.</p>

      </p>
      <p>OK, now let's get to the bad news. Finding a reliable WR3won't be easy this week, at least in 12-team leagues. Things should be a little easier in PPR formats because you can rely on catches to give you a baseline of points, but with all the struggling QBs around the league, it's tough to bank on certain guys even in favorable matchups. Terry McLaurin (vs. Lions), Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones (@ Redskins), and Allen Robinson (vs. Giants) are the types of guys we're talking about this week. You're going to start them, but you'll have to hold your breath all game.</p>

GPP</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Fortunately, there are some interesting sleepers who have even more value in PPR formats. Hunter Renfrow (@ Jets), Demaryius Thomas (vs. Raiders), Danny Amendola (@ Redskins), Russell Gage (vs. Buccaneers), Taylor Gabriel (vs. Giants), and Marcus Johnson (@ Texans) all have great matchups on paper.</p>
      <p>If you want to really rely on catches, you can try your luck with Nelson Agholor, who faces a Seahawks defense that gives up a lot of receptions but just a medium amount of yards and not many WR touchdowns. The same goes for Baltimore, which gives Robert Woods and maybe even Josh Reynolds a little more juice.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Maybe this is just perception, but it feels like this year our standard rankings and PPR rankings have been more similar than years past. Perhaps that's because of the aforementioned "big-play guys" turning more reliable; or perhaps teams are just throwing to their "best" players more often. Whatever the case, you'll be dealing with a lot of the same start 'em, sit 'em headaches as standard owners. We do our best to help by finding that balance of matchup, talent, and QB play.</p>
