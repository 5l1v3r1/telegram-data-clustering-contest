      <h2>EXCLUSIVE - CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGE: The Sunday People can reveal that despite a record number of convictions for stalking last year, 58 percent got community or suspended sentences</h2>

      <p>Stalking victims accused the justice system of a cruel betrayal as more than half of offenders dodge jail.</p>
      <p>The Sunday People can reveal that despite a record number of convictions for stalking last year, 58 percent got community or suspended sentences.</p>
      <p>It comes just a year after tougher sentences for stalkers were rolled out.</p>
      <p>Victim and anti-stalking campaigner Zoe Dronfield suffered a horrific attack by her former partner – and later found he had 13 previous stalking victims.</p>
      <p>She said: “Stalking ruined my life and almost led to my murder.”</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, from Coventry, was held captive for eight hours by Jason Smith in 2013.</p>

      <p>During her ordeal, she suffered a cracked cheekbone, a brain bleed and a stab wound to her neck.</p>
      <p>The brute – who was calling her a hundred times a day – got 14 years in 2015, ten in jail and four on licence.</p>
      <p>Slamming the latest figures, Zoe said: “Offenders should have harsher and longer sentences.</p>

      <p>"Stalking is like ­murder in slow motion. It’s a betrayal of victims that so many are let off without custodial sentences.”</p>
      <p>London’s Independent Victims’ Commissioner Claire Waxman – herself harassed for 12 years – also blasted the figures.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s disappointing to see a shockingly lenient approach. It’s crucial more is done to ensure sentencing reflects the severity of this crime.”</p>
      <p>And the Suzy Lamplugh Trust’s Suky Bhaker said: “Community sentences should never be considered as an alternative to prison if the risk cannot be managed appropriately – and what victims tell us is risk management is not always adequate.”</p>

      <p>In September last year, the maximum sentence for stalking was raised, doubling prison time from five to ten years.</p>
      <p>In total, 1,022 people were convicted of stalking in England and Wales in 2018.</p>
      <p>But MoJ data shows 396 (36 percent) got community sentences while 250 (23 percent) got suspended terms. And 58 people got just a fine, while a further 80 were just cautioned.</p>
      <p>In August, police were told not to give fixed penalty notices in stalking and harassment cases following the murder of Shana Grice, 19.</p>

      <p>She complained about stalker ex Michael Lane five times in six months – but was fined for wasting police time.</p>
      <p>Lane slit her throat in 2016 in Portslade, East Sussex. He was jailed in 2017 for a minimum 25 years.</p>
      <p>The Tory government has long promised to clamp down on domestic abusers with a raft of measures in their Domestic Violence Bill, which has been delayed since its introduction in 2017.</p>
      <p>David Spencer, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: “There has been tough talking from the MoJ but it is time to follow up with action.”</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Justice said it was down to each individual judiciary to determine sentences based on the full facts of each case.</p>
