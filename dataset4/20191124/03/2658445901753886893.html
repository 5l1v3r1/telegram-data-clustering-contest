      <p>Gospel ministers have been advised to build spiritual and relational capacity that will make them more effective in affecting lives.</p>
      <p>The Chairman General of Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Ayo Ni O) Oko-Oba Lagos, Special Apostle Emmanuel Alogbo stated this last week in a chat with reporters.</p>
      <p>He spoke ahead of the National Pastors Council Lagos/Ogun, which ends today in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Alogbo said ministers have a responsibility to preach the truth at all times, knowing they will give account to God.</p>
      <p>According to him: “We have to remember that God is watching us. We must deliver all the souls He has allocated to us.</p>
      <p>“We cannot afford to be slack because the devil is always at work. The business of saving souls must be productive and profitable.”</p>

      <p>Chairman of Lagos/Ogun Pastors Council, Pastor James Owolabi, urged ministers to make ministerial assignments the core of their lives.</p>
      <p>He said when they handle God’s works well, God will have no choice than to make their issues his business.</p>
      <p>Owolabi said: “Make the Shepherd work your work and the Chief Shepherd will make your life His project.”</p>
      <p>He informed the workshop with the theme faith unto glory was designed to build the capacity of ministers in the church for greater exploits.</p>
