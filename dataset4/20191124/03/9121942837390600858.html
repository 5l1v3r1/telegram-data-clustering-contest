      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A U.S. senator has visited the home of a detained human rights activist in the Mideast island kingdom of Bahrain.</p>
      <p>Activists shared photographs with The Associated Press showing Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, visiting the home of Nabeel Rajab on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Murphy had been in the kingdom for the annual Manama Dialogue security conference.</p>
      <p>Rajab has been detained since June 2016 on internationally criticized charges over comments he made on Twitter and in a TV interview. His detention comes amid a widespread crackdown on all dissent in Bahrain.</p>
      <p>Bahrain’s government, Murphy’s office and the U.S. Embassy in Manama did not respond to requests for comment Sunday.</p>
      <p>Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, is home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet.</p>
