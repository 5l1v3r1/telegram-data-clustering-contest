      <p>HANOVER, Germany:Â Around 7,000 people marched in the German city of Hanover on Saturday (Nov 23) to counter a gathering of around 120 far-right nationalists called to denounce media coverage of neo-nazi groups.</p>
      <p>The counter-protesters, carrying a range of flags and placards, many defending diversity and freedom of the press, marched in the northern city.</p>

      <p>Police put the total turnout for two separate counter-demonstrations at 7,000. They said around 120 members of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) turned out for their protest.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, police had tried to ban the NPD demonstration, arguing it posed a danger to public safety, but on Friday a court ruled that it could go ahead.</p>
      <p>The NPD called their demonstration to denounce journalists - a number of whom they named - who have investigated the far-right in Germany.</p>
      <p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted: "We were able to see in Hanover what is true for all of Germany: the neo-nazis and fear-mongers who stir up hate against journalists are a minority."</p>
      <p>One journalist the NPD singled out was Julian Feldmann, who made a programme for German state television about suspected Nazi war criminal Karl Muenter, implicated in a 1944 massacre of 86 people in Ascq, northern France.</p>
      <p>In a television interview, former SS soldier Muenter blamed the victims of the massacre and also made negationist remarks about the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>While awaiting trial on charges of incitement and disparaging the memory of Nazi victims, Muenter died at the age of 96 in September.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1964, the NPD has around 6,000 members.</p>
      <p>In January 2017, the constitutional court, the highest jurisdiction in Germany, rejected moves to ban the party -- the second time it has blocked such a move in 15 years.</p>
