        <li>A brace off Taijul Islam took Kohli to the coveted mark - his 27th Test century, 20th as captain.</li>
        <li>Kohli had scored his maiden international century at the Eden - but that was exactly a decade ago, in an ODI against Sri Lanka.</li>
        <li>Forty-three ODI centuries later, that remains Kohli's only three-figure knock in the 50-over format at Eden.</li>

      <p>KOLKATA: When a 50,000-strong crowd chants 'Kohli! Kohli!', it can be exhilarating or intimidating, depending on which side you are representing. And when the venue is <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>, the emotions are compounded. Many a cricketer has admitted to frayed nerves while entering this hallowed cauldron in the heart of Kolkata.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, India skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> may have felt a few goose bumps when he reached 99 with one of his boundaries and the crowd raised the decibel level in anticipation. "This can be daunting, intimidating and also exciting," Kohli had said about the Eden crowd on the eve of the match.</p>

      <p>Fans' staple diet is IPL matches and the odd T20 International and ODI these days. Now that they are here in big numbers to watch a Test match, must have pleased Kohli. Yet, he would have felt butterflies in the stomach when he played two defensive shots on 99. A brace off left-arm spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Taijul-Islam">Taijul Islam</a> then took him to the coveted mark - his 27th Test century, 20th as captain.</p>
      <p>Only two of his Test tons have come at Eden. The last time India played a Test here, he had remained unbeaten on 104 two years ago in the rain-hit drawn match against Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> was mighty pleased with the way Kohli batted. "He is a run machine," the BCCI president said. He, however, felt that sighting the pink ball was easier than the red ball.</p>

      <p>Incidentally, Kohli had scored his maiden international century at the Eden - but that was exactly a decade ago, in an ODI against Sri Lanka. Forty-three ODI centuries later, that remains his only three-figure knock in the 50-over format at Eden.</p>
      <p>Eden is always in search of heroes. The likes of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gundappa-Vishanath">Gundappa Vishanath</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sachin-Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a>, Mohammed Azharuddin, VVS Laxman, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> have enjoyed a special chemistry with this iconic venue, not to mention their very own 'Dada', who has the crowd roaring with just a wave of his hand 11 years after retirement from international cricket.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, it was Kohli's turn to experience the magical ambience at Eden. He acknowledged the cheers on reaching his century and also while leaving the ground after being brilliantly caught by Taijul.</p>
      <p>Kohli has his legion of fans all over the cricketing world, but centuries in back-to-back Tests here will surely establish him as one of Eden's favourites.</p>
