      <p>Guildford’s Willing Coffee quickly established itself as one of Perth’s top coffee destinations after opening mid-last year (I named it best new coffee bar in my <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/perth/food-and-drink/article/2018-year-cafes-breakfast-and-coffee">2018 year in review</a>). Built at the base of a residential building by property developer (and former Australian track-cycling champion) Tim Willing and wife Veronique, the pair are now repeating the formula with The Deli on Clifton &amp; Central in Mount Lawley.</p>
      <p>Willing has a personal connection to the deli, which dates back to the 1950s. “I grew up on Clifton Crescent. My brother still lives on the street, my Mum and Dad still live on the street,” he tells <i>Broadsheet</i>. “Everyone that went to Mount Lawley primary school knows that deli very well. We spent a lot of time there buying icy poles and mixed lollies by the cent.”</p>
      <p>The Deli’s interior will have a French aesthetic as opposed to Guildford’s Italian feel. In contrast, the exterior will retain its original Australiana stylings. Local artist Luke O’Donohoe has been engaged to restore the Peter’s Ice Cream sign that faces Central Avenue.</p>
      <p>Coffee will be the same as at Willing HQ, using the in-house blend and single origin roasted by head barista Jacob Chapman. A rotating selection by Australian and international coffee roasters will also be featured at both stores. The new cafe will be managed by Alex Lowes, formerly of Lowdown Espresso and Bossman Coffee.</p>
      <p>On the menu, expect granola, house-baked croissants and cakes and sourdough bread. “We’ll have classic deli items that people can enjoy, and there’s got to be icy poles and mixed lollies for the kids,” says Willing.</p>
      <p>The next-door site has been earmarked for a residential development branded “Clifton &amp; Central”, which will feature 15 apartments and a group of shop-houses intended for owner-operators who want to live above their business. Pending approval, construction will begin next year.</p>
      <p>Once the development is complete, Willing plans to introduce evening service, transforming The Deli into a Paris-inspired wine bar (making use of additional space in the new building). It’ll be a collaboration with friend and eye surgeon Dru Daniels.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen how much joy our little coffee shop brought to Guildford and there’s an opportunity to do something similar in Mount Lawley,” says Willing. “It’s almost like a theatre set. You get all these different players coming onto a stage through the day, and you get lovely little snapshots of life.”</p>
