      <p>Bayelsa State Governor, Mr Seriake Dickson, says the report of the civil service reforms carried out by his administration will be one of the key documents to be handed over to the incoming administration.</p>
      <p>Dickson, who stated this while swearing in a new commissioner, Felix Sam-Ateki, and 35 newly appointed permanent secretaries in Yenagoa on Friday, said his administration would soon receive the formal report of the reforms.</p>
      <p>He charged the commissioner and the permanent secretaries to work with the incoming administration to ensure the full implementation of the civil service reforms.</p>
      <p>He also advised them to shun partisan politics and focus on the execution of policies and programmes of the government.</p>
      <p>“You are not to be part of the dust of political conflicts. I charge you all to maintain neutrality and focus on the execution of the government’s policies and programmes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dickson said the newly appointed acting Head of Service, Mrs Biobelemoye Charles-Onyeama, who was appointed in line with his administration’s “respect for hierarchy” in the state, would be sworn in next week after the completion of her training at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies.</p>
      <p>He attributed the high number of permanent secretaries sworn in to the long delay in their appointments, noting that over 25 of them were level 17 officers.</p>
