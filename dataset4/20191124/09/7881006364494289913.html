      <p><b>Mumbai</b>: Amidst the ongoing political tussle in Maharashtra, BJP MP Sanjay Kakade met NCP Chief Sharad Pawar's at his residence here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Following the meeting with NCP chief, Kakade said that he "met Pawar for personal reasons".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The meeting between Kakade and NCP chief comes ahead of Supreme Court hearing on a joint plea of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress against the decision of Maharashtra Governor inviting BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to form the government.</p>
      <p>At a time when deliberations among Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena on the formation of a non-BJP government in the state had seemingly reached the final stage, the BJP formed the government in a surprise development on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>In a ceremony held at Raj Bhawan, Devendra Fadnavis took oath for the second consecutive term as the state's Chief Minister, while Ajit Pawar of NCP was sworn-in as deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Nationalist Congress Party late on Saturday moved 44 MLAs to Renaissance Hotel here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The BJP won 105 seats in the 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.</p>
