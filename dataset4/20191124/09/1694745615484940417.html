      <h1>Are Flautas and Taquitos the Same Thing? Here's How to Spot the Differences</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:30:08+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Haley Tharp</a></address>
      <p>If you love <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latina/Authentic-Mexican-Recipes-42385139">Mexican food</a>, you've probably wondered about the differences between flautas and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/Weelicious-Kid-Friendly-Taquitos-Recipe-24539773">taquitos</a>. If this has kept you up at night, you're in good company. Both consist of a tortilla rolled around various fillings then fried to greasy, culinary perfection. While some use the terms interchangeably, some devout <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Chile-Con-Queso-Nachos-1791654">Mexican cuisine</a> foodies distinguish between the two on the basis of size, shape, and type of tortilla.</p>
      <h3>Flautas vs. Taquitos — Size</h3>
      <p>In Spanish, flauta means "flute," which leads us to our first distinction. Flautas are often made using larger, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/What-Quesarito-Chipotle-46227715">burrito-size</a> tortillas that make a shape resembling a flute when they're rolled around filling. Taquitos are often shorter, made with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Difference-Between-Carnitas-Carne-Asada-Al-Pastor-17247251">taco-size</a> tortillas, and are considered a dish more appropriate for an appetizer.</p>
      <h3>Flautas vs. Taquitos — Shape</h3>
      <p>Both flautas and taquitos are rolled around filling for a cylindrical shape, convenient for handheld consumption. Those committed to the subtle distinctions between the two, however, may roll flautas with one end wider than the other, creating a cone shape.</p>
      <h3>Flautas vs. Taquitos — Type of Tortilla</h3>
      <p>The type of tortilla may be the most well-known distinction between the two Mexican dishes. Taquitos are most often made with corn tortillas, while flautas are typically made using <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Taco-Cones-Disney-Springs-46032490">flour tortillas</a>.</p>
      <p>Now enlightened by these three distinguishing elements, it's important to remember that many five-star chefs and occasional home cookers alike don't consider these differentiators significant. You may order a flauta off the menu and be met by a large, cylindrical corn tortilla. So in the spirit of these mouthwatering Mexican dishes, just roll with it.</p>
