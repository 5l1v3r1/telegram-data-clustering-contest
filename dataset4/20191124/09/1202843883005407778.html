      <p><b>Madrid </b>- Rafael Nadal sent Spain's Davis Cup semi-final against Britain on Saturday into a deciding doubles rubber with a 6-4, 6-0 thrashing of Dan Evans in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Kyle Edmund had earlier seen off Feliciano Lopez in straight sets to give Britain a 1-0 lead against hosts Spain.</p>
      <p>World number one Nadal stepped in for Marcel Granollers to partner Lopez in the doubles clash against Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski.</p>
      <p>The winners will face Canada in Sunday's final after the North Americans edged out Russia in the first last-four tie.</p>
      <p>Nadal took a tight opening set on his third set point in the 10th game, before racing to victory with a run of eight straight games.</p>
      <p>World number 69 Edmund claimed a hard-fought 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) win over veteran Lopez, who stepped in as a last-minute replacement for Pablo Carreno Busta.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old Lopez was broken in just the second game of the match as Edmund took the opening set, before seeing two set points come and go in the second.</p>
      <p>Edmund clinched his third straight singles victory of the week on his third match point.</p>
