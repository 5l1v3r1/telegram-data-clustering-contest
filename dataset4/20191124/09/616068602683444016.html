      <p>Meredith Goldhawk has loved hockey since she was four.</p>
      <p>But she says since a coach at the University of Windsor harassed and bullied her, she can't even bring herself to play a pickup game with friends.</p>
      <p>"Some days I will just sit down and cry because she took so much away from me," says the 22-year-old.</p>
      <p>The athlete is among several across Canada who say universities are failing to protect players from abuse. Students in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia all say their schools mishandled serious complaints against coaches in recent years.</p>
      <p>Their fight is part of a movement to end so-called "old-school" coaching techniques that experts say are abusive. But change is slow, they say, because coaches hold so much power over players and some mistakenly believe military-style training is key to winning.</p>
      <p>Six hockey players, including Goldhawk, complained to the University of Windsor about coach Deanna Iwanicka in February. The athletes allege she humiliated them in front of others, belittled them with expletive-laden insults and kicked out some without cause.</p>
      <p>The university hired an investigator but refused to provide the final report to complainants, instead sending a four-page summary that didn't address all the allegations, says Goldhawk and fellow complainant Reagan Kaufman.</p>
      <p>The summary says the investigator found the allegations were unsubstantiated. For the most part, Iwanicka was "direct, clear and professional," though it was "inappropriate and disrespectful" to tell Goldhawk and Kaufman they were being cut by phone, it says.</p>
      <p>"It's definitely not right," says Kaufman. "If they had been there for everything we went through, she definitely wouldn't still be coaching."</p>
      <p>The school says it can't comment on personnel matters and Iwanicka, who is still head coach of the women's team, didn't respond to calls and emails requesting comment.</p>
      <p>At the University of Lethbridge, an investigator found in July 2018 that women's hockey coach Michelle Janus had violated its harassment policy. The school required her to undergo counselling and additional training and it also started developing a coaches' code of conduct.</p>
      <p>But the six players who had filed complaints had called for Janus to be fired or suspended. In August 2018, four of the complainants launched a lawsuit against the university, Janus and athletics director Ken McInnes seeking more than $1 million in damages.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit alleges Janus bullied players, insulted them as "pathetic" and "useless" while using expletives, threw water bottles, broke equipment, punched doors and participated in a "fine jar" that charged fees to players for their sexual history or personal lives.</p>
      <p>It also accuses Janus and McInnes of requiring players to vote on whether to allow a teammate who had attempted suicide to return to the team.</p>
      <p>None of the allegations have been proven in court. The university, Janus and McInnes deny all the allegations in a joint statement of defence and say the lawsuit should be struck as it is "scandalous, frivolous and vexatious."</p>
      <p>Janus left her position at the university in January.</p>
      <p>Last week, the University of Victoria wrapped an appeal process after three athletes and an assistant coach filed complaints accusing women's rowing coach Barney Williams of verbal abuse and harassment.</p>
      <p>The three rowers say the university threatened them with disciplinary action if they speak about the results of the investigation.</p>
      <p>Lily Copeland is one of the complainants and has alleged Williams criticized her weight and appearance and yelled at her in a small, locked room.</p>
      <p>Williams has said respects the confidentiality of the university probe and couldn't provide a detailed response until it wrapped up. He didn't respond to requests for comment after the investigation concluded.</p>
      <p>He says he regards coaching as a privilege, and he encourages athletes to become their best version of themselves. Other athletes on the team credit Williams with their success.</p>
      <p>The university has said privacy legislation and its own confidentiality policies apply to all investigations.</p>
      <p>More than 700 national-team athletes responded to a survey by the group AthletesCan about mistreatment. Seventeen per cent reported psychological injuries, 15 per cent experienced neglect and four per cent suffered sexual harm.</p>
      <p>The federal government has brought in a series of initiatives, including establishing new policy for national sports organizations, funding the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre to create an investigation unit and setting up a toll-free confidential tip line.</p>
