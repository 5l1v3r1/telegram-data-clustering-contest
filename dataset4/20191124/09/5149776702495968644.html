      <p>A clubber caused bother after "a comedy moment" when he stood outside a bar with his outstretched right arm holding a drink just inside.</p>
      <p>Jordan Marshall, 31, came up with the trick when told it was against licensing rules to take booze out of the Atrium bar in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/police-want-speak-man-after-3570757">Newark</a>, a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/man-appears-court-following-robbery-3569698">court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>When door staff pushed him out of the way, he "lashed out" and floored one man who ended up with tiny fractures around an eye socket.</p>
      <p>Marshall admitted wounding and was ordered to pay £1,500 compensation to the doorman, who was left with numbness and "a strange feeling" when he smiles. The father-of-five said that his children were "scared to cuddle him" when the injury was at its worst.</p>
      <p>Sitting at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Sally Hancox told him: "People don't like being pushed but a door person is entitled to do that with your behaviour.</p>
      <p>"You are standing there in a comedy moment with the glass inside the night club. Then you get arsey with the door staff," she added.</p>
      <p>The incident was captured on CCTV which was played in court before sentence was passed on Marshall of Clumber Avenue, Newark. He was given a 20-month prison term, suspended for two years, and must do 100 hours community work.</p>
      <p>Kevin Jones, prosecuting, said that the doorman is a single parent who had to take 11 weeks off work and needed surgery.</p>
      <p>"That made it difficult for him to support his family," added Mr Jones.</p>
      <p>Mark Nicholls, mitigating, said that Marshall had "access to £2,000" for compensation. He added: "He is working full-time as a funeral parlour sales person."</p>
