      <h1>Holiday events and fun in Snohomish County and beyond for 2019</h1>
      <h2>Our annual list of holiday happenings include lights, concerts, theater and dance performances.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/sara-bruestle/" target="_blank">Sara Bruestle</a></address>
      <p>My Christmas tradition is attending the Gothard Sisters’ annual Celtic Christmas concert. My Features colleague Sharon Salyer’s is the annual Christmas concert by the Mill Creek Chorale, for which her brother sings baritone. And Features writer Evan Thompson takes in the Lights of Christmas at Warm Beach.</p>
      <p>The Gothard Sisters will perform their sixth annual Christmas with the Gothards concert Dec. 6 in Edmonds. Greta, Willow and Solana look forward to their annual hometown concert all year, and so do I.</p>
      <p>The 95-member Mill Creek Chorale — including Sharon’s brother Ival — will sing its “I Wish You Christmas” concert on Dec. 7 in Bothell. Songs will include Ola Gjeilo’s “Away in a Manger,” “Festival First Nowell” by Dan Forrest, John Rutter’s “I Wish You Christmas” and “Ain’t That a Rockin’” by Stacey Gibbs.</p>
      <p>The Lights of Christmas at Warm Beach run Dec. 1-29 and feature more than 1 million Christmas lights. It reminds Evan of a family tradition where the Thompsons would drive around Clinton neighborhoods to look at all the sparking holiday decorations.</p>
      <p>What’s your Christmas tradition? If you don’t have one yet, you’re sure to find it in The Daily Herald’s annual list of holiday events. They span from before Thanksgiving to after New Year’s Eve, and include lights, concerts, theater and dance performances, and fun stuff for kids.</p>
