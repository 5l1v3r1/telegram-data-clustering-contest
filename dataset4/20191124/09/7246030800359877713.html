      <h1>Iran’s Mullahs Killed 400, Wounded 4,000, Detained 10,000 in Fight for their Lives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:19:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/di/" target="_blank">David Israel</a></address>
      <p>The People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) announced on Saturday that the Iranian regime killed more than 300 protestors in different cities around the country, noting that the number of dead is “much higher and the regime is trying to conceal the scale of its horrific crimes.”</p>
      <p>“The bodies of many of the martyrs have been collectively taken from hospitals or their location of martyrdom by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other suppressive forces to unknown locations,” the MEK said.</p>

      <p>Tehran prisons are reportedly overflowing with detainees and are facing extreme space shortages. The situation is even worse in other cities and prisoners are being held in locations belonging to the IRGC, State Security Forces (SSF) and the government.</p>
      <p>Christian Malard, a French journalist and foreign correspondent for France 3, reported that the demonstrations which began as protests against the sharp rise in fuel prices in Iran, have now become a full-blown revolt in response to the carnage against civilians. He cited reports of more than 400 dead in clashes with the regime.</p>

      <p>Maryam Rajavi, wife of the disappeared leader of MEK Massoud Rajavi, who has taken his place as the leader of the Iranian resistance, announced on Saturday the approaching death of Velayat-e Faqih – the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist, a.k.a. the Twelvers – a theological concept of Islamic sages’ rule which was applied since 1979 in Iran which has since been ruled by a supreme leader and 12 governor clerics.</p>
      <p>“The whole issue is that the Velayat-e Faqih regime is on its last leg,” Rajavi tweeted. “Therefore, supporting the arisen people, the rebellious youths and resistance units is a patriotic duty.”</p>
      <p>Rajavi described the slaughter of the protesters as a manifest case of crimes against humanity. She urged the United Nations Security Council, governments and the international community to bring about an immediate halt to the killings and suppression and to secure the release of the detainees.</p>
      <p>She stressed that the detainees are in danger of being tortured or executed, and so the UN must immediately send investigative and fact-finding missions to Iran.</p>
      <p>Rajavi added that the leaders of this regime must face justice for committing crimes against humanity. Silence and inaction vis-à-vis crimes against humanity, she said, are not only a violation of international conventions, laws, and standards but also embolden the mullahs to continue to commit these atrocities against the Iranian people and spread them to the rest of the region.</p>

      <p>In an address on Sunday morning, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei warned that “all the evil centers in the world” have mobilized efforts in recent days to encourage unrest in Iran.</p>
      <p>Iran’s First Vice President Es’hagh Jahangiri warned that his country would respond resolutely to countries that try to interfere in Iran’s internal affairs.</p>
      <p>“After their failure in the economic war, Americans changed their approach and tried to impose pressure on Iran through interference and with help of some other countries,” he said on Saturday in Tehran, and warned: “Some regional states should know that if clues are uncovered about their role in creating unrest in Iran, they will not have good times in the region. If it turns out that others have interfered in Iran’s internal affairs to inflict damage to the Iranian nation, they will surely receive a crushing response.”</p>
      <p>The spokesman of the IRGC told Tasnim reported that said the security forces have managed to control about 100 cities involved in the riots, and have been able to arrest the ringleaders of the violent protests.</p>
