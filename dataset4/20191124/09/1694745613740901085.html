      <h1>The Most Foolproof Way to Make Prime Rib Roast in an Instant Pot — Yes, an Instant Pot!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:35:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Hajar Larbah</a></address>
      <p>Planning dinner for the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/how-i-prepare-early-for-holiday-season-46764697">holidays</a> shouldn't be stressful. If you're short on time and running around picking up last-minute gifts for loved ones, you're going to want to bookmark this recipe. No table is set without the star dish in the center — a roast! I'm not sure about you, but a perfectly cooked prime rib roast is my favorite thing to have. It's warm and comforting, especially with some <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Mustard-Roasted-Potatoes-Recipe-39114156">roasted potatoes</a> on the side. The best part about this recipe though is it can all be made in an <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/How-Eat-Out-Instant-Pot-Week-45675013">Instant Pot</a>. Instead of taking hours, this garlicky, buttery, herbed roast only takes around an hour to make.</p>

      <p>Here is what you will need:</p>

      <p>In a small bowl, combine the butter with the spices until fully incorporated. Then, spread the butter evenly on all sides of the meat.</p>
      <p>Pour in the beef stock at the bottom of your Instant Pot, and then lower the trivet into the pot and place your roast on top.</p>
      <h3>3 Cook the Roast</h3>

      <p>The best way to cook a roast is first under high heat or pressure for the first few minutes, and then a slow roast at a lower temperature for the rest of time. To do this, secure the lid and lock it with the pressure valve sealed. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, and after time is up, on keep warm for 35 minutes. If you're looking for medium-rare meat that is mostly pink with a red center, aim for a temperature of around 135 degrees F.</p>
      <h3>4 Resting Time</h3>

      <p>Once the roast is at the temperature you desire, remove it from the Instant Pot and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. This prevents all the juices from pouring out when you cut into it; the last thing you want is a dry roast. After you've allowed it to rest, you can untie the string and begin carving.</p>
      <h3>5 Serve</h3>

      <p>If you'd like to serve it with a gravy, just add two tablespoons of flour to the fat drippings in your Instant Pot and whisk together until you have a gravy consistency. Serve the prime rib whole or already cut into portions. Enjoy!</p>
