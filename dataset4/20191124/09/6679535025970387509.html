      <h1>Never had desire to enter politics: PM Modi</h1>
      <h2>In his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, the Prime Minister lauds the patience and maturity shown by the people post Ayodhya verdict</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:02:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-65446/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his monthly radio broadcast <i>Maan Ki Baat</i> on Sunday, lauded the “patience and maturity” shown by the people of the country in accepting the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case, and said the respect for the judiciary had gone up.</p>
      <p>In the same programme, while interacting with some cadets of the National Cadets Corps (NCC), Mr. Modi said he had no desire to enter politics, but now that he was a politician, he would do his best for the people.</p>
      <p>“Now this is a very difficult question because every child goes through multiple phases in life. Sometimes one wants to become this, sometimes one wants to become that, but it is true that I never had the desire to enter politics, nor I ever thought about it,” Mr. Modi replied when asked what would he have become if not a politician.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the Ayodhya verdict, the Prime Minister said the maturity shown by the people in accepting the Supreme Court ruling proved that there was nothing bigger than the national interest for Indians, and the country had now moved on to a new path with a new resolve.</p>
      <p>“The resolve is full of new hopes and aspirations. It is my hope and wish that New India imbibes this feeling and forges ahead in a spirit of peace, unity and goodwill,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I would like to appreciate and thank my countrymen. I am particularly grateful to them for the patience, restraint and maturity shown by them. In the truest sense, this verdict has also proved to be a milestone for the judiciary in our country,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Constitution Day on November 26, the day when the Constitution was adopted, the Prime Minister urged the citizens to uphold the values and ideals enshrined in it.</p>
      <h3>Exam stress</h3>
      <p>Addressing students who would be appearing for the board exams, Mr. Modi said the Human Resource Development Ministry was working on organising his annual interaction — <i>Pariksha Pe Charcha</i> (discussion on exams) — where the PM motivates young students to cope with exam stress.</p>
      <p>Mr. Modi also spoke on the importance of indigenous languages and their importance in preserving the diversity of India. Quoting the late 19th century Tamil poet Subramania Bharati, Mr. Modi said: “He said that Mother India had 30 crore faces, but one body. She speaks 18 languages, but thinks as one”.</p>
