      <p>Prince Andrew apparently just can’t quit accused Jeffrey Epstein procurer Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The reckless royal secretly met with Epstein’s former gal pal at Buckingham palace in early June,<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718971/Prince-Andrew-secretly-met-Jeffrey-Epsteins-madam-Ghislaine-Maxwell-Buckingham-Palace.html"> the Daily Mail reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The hush-hush tete-a-tete came just two weeks after US prosecutors announced they were reopening an inquiry into Epstein’s alleged sex-trafficking operation — a probe that could well involve both Andrew and Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The FBI <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/fbi-wants-to-interview-prince-andrew-for-info-on-epstein-report/">wants to interview Andrew</a> about his ties to Epstein, who committed suicide in a Manhattan federal prison in August.</p>
      <p>Maxwell, who has been named in civil suits by multiple Epstein accusers as helping to keep him supplied with young women and underage girls, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ghislaine-maxwell-is-too-loyal-to-prince-andrew-to-implicate-him-in-fbi-interview-insider-says/">is assumed to be in hiding</a>.</p>
