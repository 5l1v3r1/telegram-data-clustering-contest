      <h2>EXCLUSIVE John Conteh opens up on the highs and lows from his life inside and outside the ring after a career as one of Britain's greatest ever boxers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Scouse superstar John Conteh stepped inside the ring for 39 times, including seven world title fights, during a career which transcended his generation.</p>
      <p>His career took him from the Commonwealth Games to the likes of Las Vegas, Anfield, Belgrade and Atlantic City via the glitz and glamour of primetime TV.</p>
      <p>But it was not winning the WBC light-heavyweight title, or being the inaugural champion of Christmas TV classic <i>Superstars</i> which was Conteh’s biggest triumph.</p>
      <p>His greatest fight is ongoing to this day - over 30 years sober in his battle with the grips of alcoholism which cut short a glittering career.</p>
      <p>Conteh was only 29 when he hung up the gloves, and less than two years later he was receiving treatment for the illness which caught up with one of the stars of boxing in the 1970s.</p>

      <p>Speaking candidly with Mirror Sport at Maurice Newman's Great Ormond Street Charity Golf tournament at Stapleford Abbots, Conteh said: “I was young, and my lifestyle outside of boxing, drink in particular, that all came into it.</p>
      <p>“Drugs came into it a little bit as well, but it was drink and alcoholism really that really got me.</p>
      <p>“That went way back, looking back on it now, but because you’re young you can punch through it.</p>
      <p>“As you get older, it starts taking effect. And there was all that going down as well.</p>
      <p>“As much as you’ve got the other stuff going around, boxing in my case, you’ve got whatever is in your life to deal with at the same time and alcoholism was what was in my life at the time.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know it when I was young. It was just having a good time, work hard, play hard sort of thing but then it catches up with you and takes its toll.</p>

      <p>“I was in the charter clinic for alcoholism in 1981, the year after I retired.</p>
      <p>"Things were happening. Car crashes, different relationships breaking down, with family and stuff like that.</p>
      <p>“Things impact you and it gets to the stage where you realise you have to look at it. I did, and I ended up in a clinic in 1981.</p>
      <p>“There’s influences, determiners and little factors, but alcoholism is an illness. It’s a cross section of society, from Yale to jail as they say in recovery programs.</p>
      <p>“It’s an illness, so it’s not a case of saying, ‘if I’d have done this, I could have done this, is it just me?’.</p>
      <p>“It’s like any other illness, it’s the number one illness for a lot of people, and you have to get treatment for it.</p>
      <p>“One day at a time, I’ve been sober for 30 years.”</p>

      <p>Like a maverick in the truest sense of the word, Conteh was a natural talent.</p>
      <p>He first stepped into a boxing gym near Liverpool aged just 11, and instantly recognised his talent.</p>
      <p>“I found it was natural,” he recalls. “I always remember them teaching us technical stuff, and telling us if somebody shows an orthodox right hand, move to your left and come back with a left hook to the body.</p>
      <p>“I did that and this kid went down. This was straightaway, we were only 11 years of age, and I thought, ‘I like this, this is good’.</p>
      <p>“I found I was natural at it. I could do athletics and football at the school, but it was boxing I loved and I made a decision to follow.”</p>
      <p>But he was not instantly able to turn his natural talent into success, with a defeat at the Junior ABA Championships prompting a change in attitude which culminated in a gold medal at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh before turning professional.</p>
      <p>Conteh comments: “Junior and schoolboy I wasn’t that dedicated, then I made a decision as a senior to really commit.</p>
      <p>“I got beaten in the Junior ABA championships in 1968, and I came back to Liverpool and thought, ‘hang on, am I going to go forward with this or not?’.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I knew I had to be dedicated, and that was it then. It was eat, sleep, breath boxing 24 hours a day.</p>
      <p>“I did OK as a senior then turned pro with the same attitude when I came down to London in 1971. <br/>“Give it everything you’ve got, and that’s what I did.”</p>
      <p>Conteh rapidly rose through the ranks until his crowning moment against Argentinian Jorge Ahumada in London in 1971.</p>
      <p>Having stopped domestic rival Chris Finnegan in the second fight of a thrilling trilogy in May 1974, he was handed a shot at the vacant WBC world title.</p>
      <p>“That was fantastic,” Conteh declares “1971, October 1st, fighting Jorge Ahumada from Argentina.</p>
      <p>"It was the vacant light heavyweight championship of the world, vacated by the great Bob Foster, from Alburqurque.</p>
      <p>“Jorge had got a draw four months earlier in Alburqurque which meant the champion retained his title, then he retired and vacated.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“George and I fought on October 1st and I won by unanimous decision over 15 rounds.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough, going that distance, but it’s just you against another guy. If he can do it, you can do it. You prepare for that, and my trainer used to say to me, most fights are won and lost on the training ground.</p>
      <p>“I knew I’d worked hard, I was in great shape, and I was able to dig deep and do what I needed to to bring home the belt.”</p>
      <p>Three defences followed, including a perfect homecoming as he knocked out Len Hutchins in the third round at Anfield in March 1977, before a controversial points loss to Yugoslavian Mate Parlov in a hostile atmosphere in Belgrade.</p>
      <p>He looked to regain the belt against Matthew Saad Muhammad, once losing on points in a gruelling battle which saw the bout later deemed a no contest as the American was found to have used illegal substances to treat cuts.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>By the time the rematch came along, Conteh’s party lifestyle had started to catch up with him and he was powerless to prevent a stoppage defeat against the hard-punching home favourite.</p>
      <p>He states: “I had the two big fights in America, against Matt Franklin as his name was first time around, then he became a Muslim and changed his name to Matthew Saad Muhammad.</p>
      <p>“The illegal substance use on cuts above his eyes meant he had the first win taken away from him.</p>
      <p>“When I went back for the rematch, you go in and try and do you best but I just felt I was a bit over the top by that time in a way.</p>
      <p>“Again, I’m not taking anything away from a great fighter. He was a great fighter, a great puncher, and I got stopped in four rounds.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>“Then I came back, had one 10-rounder and retired after that. Going into the fight, I gave it the same preparation, gave it 100%.</p>
      <p>“But I was all or nothing. That’s the way my attitude was. If you’re going to do it, give it everything you’ve got, and I just felt it wasn’t there when I retired.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t have the same hunger, the same reaction wasn’t there, the fitness at that elite level.</p>
      <p>“I think my lifestyle outside the ring wasn’t helping a lot either. That was weakening me a bit as well.</p>
      <p>“I definitely thought I was over the top at that point, and I wasn’t going to hand around trying to regain ground.”</p>
      <p>His career came to an abrupt end aged just 29, but with a winning homecoming, again at Anfield, against James Dixon.</p>
      <p>Asked what he considers the highlight of his career, he considers a number of moments.</p>
      <p>“Winning the world title obviously stands out,” he says.</p>
      <p>“Boxing Chris Finnegan, twice, for the European and British titles. They were hard fights.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“When I went over to Belgrade to try and regain my world titles, Mate Parlov, in Belgrade. That was a great fight, a tough 15 rounds. I thought I’d won it but I didn’t get it.</p>
      <p>“Also, the first fight with Saad Muhammad was a great one as well.”</p>
      <p>It was also away from boxing that he was catapulted into the limelight, winning sporting decathlon-style contest Superstars in 1974.</p>
      <p>The contest formed part of his training for his fight against Ahumada, a bout he had already won by the time it was aired and brought him into the mainstream.</p>
      <p>“I consider 1974, when I won Superstars, as my great year,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I was very fit, I was 23 years of age, it was a couple of months before the world championship fight in October.</p>

        <figcaption>Conteh rubbed shoulders with Muhammad Ali en route to emulating him by becoming a world champion<cite>(Image: Mirrorpix)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“Although Superstars wasn’t shown until Christmas, we’d done it in August and I’d won it over 10 events.</p>
      <p>“I was really fit, and I think if I hadn’t been a boxer I’d have definitely gone into athletics.</p>
      <p>“It was fantastic, a great vehicle to shoot off all the advertising and media stuff. To be able to use it in that way was a big boost for my career and a great platform.”</p>
      <p>The downside, however, was early celebrity status and a party lifestyle which ultimately caught up with him.</p>
      <p>The dangers of alcohol and the temptations associated with life as a top class sportsman are well-documented in the modern era.</p>
      <p>But Conteh believes he would have simply been in a more vulnerable position in the modern day as he insists he has no regrets.</p>

        <figcaption>Conteh lived the party lifestyle but insists he has no regrets<cite>(Image: Mirrorpix)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Asked if he would have had a longer career if he had his time now, Conteh jokes: “No, I probably would’ve had a shorter career nowadays with the money involved!</p>
      <p>“I’ve certainly got no regrets. You give it everything you’ve got at the time you’re in, and if I was boxing today I’d give it everything you’ve got.</p>
      <p>“The regret, the doubt, the analysis is normal, it’s human. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s what I do with that.</p>
      <p>“What do I understand about regret? When I look it through, I realise I did what I did, and there was life as well outside the ring. <br/>“Some of what I did may not have been good, but I gave it everything I’d got, I did the best I could and that’s life.</p>
      <p>“That’s not self-justification or rationalisation of this, that and the other. That’s just life and the way it works.</p>
      <p>“No matter what you do, what level you’re at, we all have things going on in our life and do the best we can with the situation we’re in at the present time.”</p>
