      <p>The 24-year-old centre-back, who is one of the important members of the Warriors in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign, says he would like to further his career in the English Premiership.</p>
      <p>Hadebe is inspired by his teammate from the national team Marvelous Nakamba, who plays for Aston Villa, in his dream.</p>
      <p>“My dream is to play in the English Premier League where my brother Marvelous is playing right now,’’ said Hadebe, as quoted by Zimbabwean publication The Herald.</p>

      <p>“Although I am still adjusting to life in Turkey, for me, this is a stepping stone because I want to eventually play in the English Premier League. Marvelous has shown us that it’s possible to play in such a big league like the English Premier League and that has been inspiring us to try and do as well as he has done. He has been a revelation at Aston Villa, not many people expected that he would settle so quickly and play as well as he has been doing and that gives all of us hope that we can get that far. It’s about chasing your dreams and being disciplined and remaining focused on doing your job and while, right now, my focus is on ensuring that my team in Turkey continues to do very well, I also have dreams of playing for an English side one day,” the defender added.     </p>
