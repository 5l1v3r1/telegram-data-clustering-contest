      <p>From interesting scenes in <i>Call of Duty: Mobile</i> to just a walkthrough of your new app, it is now easy to record the screen on <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ios/">iOS</a> devices and make a video that can be shared with anyone. From iOS 11, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/apple/">Apple</a> has added an option to natively record a video of what you’re doing on screen. The recorded video can be silent or with an audio from your microphone.</p>

      <p>*First things first add the feature to your Control Center by going to <b>Settings</b>&gt;<b>Control Center</b>&gt;<b>Customise controls</b>, then tap the green button next to screen recording.</p>
      <p>*The screen recording widget should now be visible in your <b>Control Center</b>, which can be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen or swipe down from the top-right edge on the iPhone 11, iPhone XR or iPhone XS.</p>

      <p>*Once you press the <b>Screen Record</b> icon, you will get a three-second countdown before your device starts recording. Simultaneously, a red bar will be visible on the top left side of the screen, indicating the recording is on.</p>
