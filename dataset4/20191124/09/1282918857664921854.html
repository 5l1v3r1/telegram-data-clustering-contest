      <h4>'Personal decision made by Ajit Pawar, the NCP party is against this'</h4>
      <p>Commenting on Ajit Pawar's move, Sharad Pawar reiterated that NCP neither support nor endorses Ajit Pawar’s decision. Sharad Pawar also claimed he was unaware of the developments and was informed about it in the morning. "NCP had won 54 seats, Shiv Sena 56 and Congress 44. The combined strength of all the three parties along with the support from individual MLAs was coming up to 169. While the discussions on certain incidents took place, a coworker from the party contacted me at 6:30 am in the morning and informed me that there is this oath-taking ceremony that is taking place in Raj Bhawan. He informed me that NCP party members under the leadership of Ajit Pawar have gone to the Governor to take the oath. This is a personal decision made by Ajit Pawar, the NCP party is against this. A true worker of NCP would never join hands with BJP”. </p>
