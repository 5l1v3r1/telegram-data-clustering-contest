      <h1>Philippines apologizes over SEA games mess</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:43:08+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Southeast Asian Games host the Philippines apologized on Sunday after some arriving athletes were left stranded for hours at the airport or were driven to the wrong hotel, a logistical snafu that drew criticism just days before the competition starts.</p>
      <p>Athletes have begun flying into Manila ahead of Saturday’s opening, but for Cambodia and East Timor’s football squads the arrival was not what they were expecting.</p>
      <p>“We had to wait maybe like eight, nine hours to get our hotel,” Coach Felix Dalmas of Cambodia told a press conference Sunday, adding that they had also waited hours for the shuttle service.</p>

      <p>East Timor’s team was driven to the wrong hotel, complicating their arrival and training schedules.</p>
      <p>“All nations deserve respect and what happened yesterday was not so beautiful,” East Timor’s coach Fabiano Flora told reporters.</p>
      <p>The Philippines SEA Games organizing committee offered an explanation of the hiccups, putting the blame on a last-minute change in travel plans and the afternoon check-in time of the hotel.</p>
      <p>“We sincerely apologize to our athlete guests… for the inconvenience caused to them by the confusion,” the committee said in a statement. “We… vow to do better.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Thailand’s football team — which also waited for hours at the airport for the right documents — had to change their training plans because the hotel was too far from the venue.</p>
      <p>Coach Akira Nishino said they opted to work out in the streets near the hotel instead of spending hours traveling.</p>
      <p>The games, the first hosted by the Philippines since 2005, are expected to draw thousands of athletes, journalists and dignitaries over their nearly two-week run.</p>
      <p>Smooth functioning logistics will be key to the success of the 56 sports spread across dozens of venues in and around Manila.</p>
      <p>The hotel and pick up problems came as organizers were already under fire over a nearly $1-million cauldron that will hold the games’ flame.</p>
      <p>Critics said the money it cost to build the 50-meter (160 feet) cauldron at the main stadium in Clark, north of Manila, would have been better spent helping the nation’s children and poor.</p>
