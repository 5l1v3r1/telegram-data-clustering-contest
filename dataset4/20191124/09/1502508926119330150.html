      <h2>CII report, titled 'Can the Indian PSEs enhance their Geo-strategic reach', presents a roadmap to expand exports and geo-strategic reach of public sector enterprises by 2022</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:50:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>To enhance their geo-strategic reach, India's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-sector-enterprises">public sector enterprises </a>should bid for international projects as a consortium, work with the government to design WTO-smart subsidies and enhance exports, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The CII report, titled 'Can the Indian PSEs enhance their Geo-strategic reach', presents a roadmap to expand <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/exports">exports </a>and geo-strategic reach of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-sector-enterprises">public sector enterprises </a>(PSEs) by 2022.</p>
      <p>It also points out several domestic and external barriers which are inhibiting the PSEs' ability to enhance <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/exports">exports.</a> Lack of autonomy, multiple procedures and management gaps, among others, lead to loss of potential business opportunities, it pointed out.</p>
      <p>"Setting up a High-Level Export Strategy Committee will implement the five-point agenda set out by the Prime Minister for enhancing the competitiveness of Indian PSEs by 2022.</p>
      <p>"A short-term (5 years) and long-term (10 years) roadmap for the PSEs, clearly laying down <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/exports">exports </a>and growth targets, is the order of the day to enhance their geo-strategic reach," said Chandrajit Banerjee, Director-General, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).</p>
      <p>The report recommends <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-sector-enterprises">public sector enterprises </a>bid for international projects as a consortium, leveraging each other's mutual competence, experiences and strengths. They should also leverage regional and bilateral <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trade">trade </a>agreements in sectors where they have a comparative advantage.</p>
      <p>Long-term political strategy and planning is needed for the success of PSEs as they often invest in strategic and long-term projects abroad. Each nodal ministry should have an international desk, it said.</p>
      <p>Most PSEs have been exporting and/or have an international presence. As per the report, they now have presence in over 80 countries across diverse regions with the majority concentrated in the South Asian region.</p>
      <p>A number of them are moving away from their traditional markets to new markets, such as Africa and Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV).</p>
      <p>The chamber has suggested a well-defined process for sharing of information between the Indian embassies, nodal ministries, PSEs and their associations.</p>
