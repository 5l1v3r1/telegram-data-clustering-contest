      <p>A recent article in The Herald, “<a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/life/addiction-blindfolds-not-only-addicts-but-their-families/">Addiction blindfolds, not only addicts but their families</a>.” recommends 12-step programs.</p>
      <p>Twelve-step programs are a wonderful community resource. However, they are not evidence-based practice. Families need psychoeducation. Psychoeducational programs and 12-step programs are not mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>From Wikipedia: “Psychoeducation offered to patients and family members teaches problem-solving and communication skills and provides education and resources in an empathetic and supportive environment. Results from more than 30 studies indicate psychoeducation improves family well-being, lowers rates of relapse and improves recovery.”</p>
      <p>In the U.S. we have an informational website Partnership for Drug Free America. A program outside of the U.S., Family Drug Support Australia, offers local educational programs, support groups, and includes the “empathetic and supportive environment” of true psychosocial education.</p>
      <p>I just received their manual. Our community could learn and build resources based on decades of pioneering work done in Australia. We could provide psychoeducational offerings.</p>
      <p>These resources have the power to provide perspective, self-compassion and strength in families.</p>
      <p>From 1966 when addiction became part of my life, until 2015, my resources included 12-step programs, the family disease model of addiction, and occasional counseling.</p>
      <p>When I discovered the psychoeducational programs outside of the United States, my life sense of wellbeing improved dramatically.</p>
      <p>I would never deny the reality of pain. I lost my son, Jeff, in 2009. I lost his brother, Ed, in 2017.</p>
