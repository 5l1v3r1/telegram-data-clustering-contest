      <h1>Beck: Hyperspace review – dewy, plush and on-trend</h1>

      <p><i>Colors</i>, Beck’s last album, won two <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/grammys-2019-beck-wins-best-alternative-music-album/">Grammies</a>. Its sequel finds Beck retaining the marketplace nous of producer Greg Kurstin on one track and adding that of Pharrell Williams, purveyor of cheek-popping flair on more than half the album. Beck’s records can often veer away from the sound of their predecessors, but <i>Hyperspace</i> is no minimal DIY folk jam: it’s dewy, plush and on-trend.</p>
      <p>Beck’s eclecticism arguably paved the way for the bonfire of the genres in the present decade – even phenomena such as Old Town Road. Here, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXrlWw3yhW4">Saw Lightning</a> is a genre-torching bop that harks all the way back to Beck’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSPaXgAdzE">Loser</a> days, but it’s a red herring. Lit by the glow of vintage video games and a kind of hazy west coast liminality, <i>Hyperspace</i> sounds mushily contemporary, at least at first. It glides along on lasers, coasts on thermals – until suddenly it doesn’t. Deep turmoil festers at the centre of these superficially dazed confections, featuring Auto-Tune, multi-tracking, bleached funk, raps and woah-woah-woahs. The gestation of the album coincided with the breakdown of Beck’s marriage of 15 years. Once the lyrical sorrow and apocalyptic visions hit home, <i>Hyperspace</i> is revealed as a bleak, spacey R&amp;B tour de force.</p>
