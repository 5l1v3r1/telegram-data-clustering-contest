      <p>A group of 22 militants of ISIS Khurasan, the offshoot of IS terrorist group in Afghanistan, surrendered to Afghan Special Forces in Nangarhar province.</p>
      <p>According to a statement released by Ministry of Defense (MoD), the militants surrendered to Special Forces in Achin district of Nangarhar.</p>
      <p>The statement further added that the militants also handed over 18 Ak-47 assault rifles to Special Forces.</p>
      <p>This comes as a group of 10 ISIS militants surrendered to Special Forces in Achin district a day earlier, days after more than 600 militants and family members of the group surrendered to security forces in Nangarhar.</p>
      <p>The terror group started its operations in Achin district of Nangarhar nearly five years ago and were attempting to turn the province into their regional operational hub.</p>
      <p>However, the security forces backed by coalition forces suppressed the terror group before they could expand their foothold in Nangarhar and other parts of the country.</p>
