        <b>CELTIC boss Neil Lennon last night told Rangers he’s LOVING their title fight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> moved three points clear in what’s been a neck and neck battle at the top of the Premiership – with Steven Gerrard’s men at <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14917/hamilton/">Hamilton</a> tomorrow.</p>

      <p>A James Forrest double and strikes from Odsonne Edouard and Scott Brown saw the Celts demolish Livingston – with Rennes up next in the Europa League at Parkhead on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>And asked if he felt it was a proper title contest with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a>, Lennon replied: “At the minute, no question, yes.</p>
      <p>“Psychologically that’s a good win for us.</p>
      <p>“We can enjoy our Sunday, you get 24 hours to enjoy, see what the result brings then you move on to the next one.</p>

      <p>“We put that to bed, that was a tough game under the circumstances.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve dealt with it absolutely brilliantly so we look forward to Rennes on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I think you’ve got to relish the pressure - you either relish it or fear it.</p>
      <p>“So RELISH it. It’s great.</p>
      <p>“Maybe it is something new for some of the players but I feel they are taking on the challenge well and I think the fans are enjoying it as well.</p>
      <p>“There will be anxious moments as we go along, dips and troughs - but we are in a strong position currently and playing brilliantly.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think about goal difference at the moment it is way too early.”</p>
      <p>Lennon purred with satisfaction as his juggernaut team made it eight straight wins in all competitions, including five successive in the league without a goal lost since the defeat at Livingston early October.</p>
      <p>He said: “We were very powerful today.</p>
      <p>“Not just because of our fitness levels and the way we battled for second balls – but our football was superb.</p>
      <p>“It was a comprehensive win against a tough team to beat at times.</p>
      <p>“We were outstanding and when you come back from two weeks off you always worry that momentum will be lost.</p>
      <p>“But there was no sign of that at all.</p>
      <p>“There wasn't one weakness out there and I'm thrilled with that.</p>
      <p>“Their attitude is first class, in terms of how we approached it.”</p>
      <p>Lennon lost Jonny Hayes through injury but also welcomed back Leigh Griffiths.</p>
      <p>He added: “You can see how popular Leigh is with the fans.</p>
      <p>“It's a timely comeback from him with the volume of games we've got.</p>
      <p>“Jonny Hayes popped his shoulder so we will have to scan it and see how it is, hopefully not too bad.</p>
      <p>“We made the change and Greg Taylor came in and did a great job.”</p>
