      <p>Plymouth Argyle will end up having played only three times in November but it has still been a very important, profitable month for them.</p>
      <p>By the time comes around for their next game, away to Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup second round, it will be December 1.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">Ryan Lowe’s Pilgrims</a> have won all three of their matches this month and against good opposition too.</p>
      <p>That humiliating 4-0 Devon Derby defeat at Exeter City at the end of October now seems in the distant past.</p>
      <p>It says a lot about the character of this group of Argyle players that they have been able to put that game behind them.</p>
      <p>There was a furious reaction from the Green Army in the immediate aftermath, and rightly so.</p>
      <p>To their credit, though, the Pilgrims’ players have gone a long way to making amends for it with their results in November.</p>
      <p>They had to wait two weeks for their next competitive match after the defeat by Exeter.</p>
      <p>That was caused by the postponement of their game against Grimsby Town on November 2 due to structural damage to the Barn Park End roof caused by overnight gales.</p>
      <p>So it was not until November 9 that Argyle finally got the chance to get Exeter out of their systems.</p>
      <p>They started that process by beating Bolton Wanderers 1-0 in the FA Cup first round.</p>
      <p>Argyle followed that up with a victory by the same scoreline at then League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers.</p>

      <p>The Pilgrims then completed a 100 per cent November with a 2-1 defeat of high-flying Bradford City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bradford arrived at Home Park third in the table and on a good run of form themselves, but they ended the day in seventh position after losing to Argyle.</p>
      <p>Lowe, wisely, made the point that no-one in the Pilgrims’ camp was getting too carried away by their results in November.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, they also deserve a short opportunity to savour how far they have come since that fateful day at Exeter.</p>
      <p>They could have crumbled after that. Instead, they have come together as a team and there is hope for what is still to come this season.</p>
      <p>One of the keys to their success has been the outstanding form of midfielder Antoni Sarcevic.</p>
      <p>He scored the winning goal against Forest Green but, generally, his performances, both in an attacking sense and defensively, have been excellent.</p>
      <p>The three wins on the bounce have also come with on-loan Chelsea defender Josh Grant playing in a new midfield holding role.</p>
      <p>That has given Argyle a more solid defensive look about them and a base to build from.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims have conceded only one goal in the last three matches, and that was an unfortunate 51st minute own goal from Niall Canavan.</p>
      <p>With Grant excelling in a different position it has also led to Joe Edwards moving to right wing-back.</p>
      <p>He is well on the way to making that his permanent place in the team, not least because he scored one of the goals against Bradford.</p>
      <p>Edwards is a player who brings a lot of determination and energy to the team, which are both excellent assets for a wing-back to have.</p>
      <p>He scored both goals in the 2-2 draw at Crawley Town in September from that position and now has added another one.</p>
      <p>That is exactly what Lowe wants to see from the players in the wing-back positions in his favoured 3-5-2 formation.</p>
      <p>It has all started to click into place for Argyle and while they are far from the finished article they are a lot further along the way to that than they were at the start of November.</p>
