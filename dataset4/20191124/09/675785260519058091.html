      <p>Peter Andre was dancing on the tables at a charity event on Saturday night after vowing to set his audience on fire with his blinding performance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/peter-andre">The 46-year-old Australian music legend</a> was the headline performer at the Back On Track Dancing With Heroes Ball at The London Hilton Hotel in Park Lane.</p>
      <p>He was joined by 14-year-old son Junior who proudly shared videos and photos from the night via his instagram stories showing Peter whipping through a set of east listening tunes.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Pete had shared a pep talk he had from friends before his performance as he limbered up to sing for the live audience.</p>

      <p>“Peter, here’s how it goes; you’ve got the band behind you, alright? We’ve got Peter Andre up front, okay? And we’ve got the audience,” a friend said as he devised an attack plan for the singer.</p>
      <p>“We start at 11 o clock, over here you call it 23 hundred hours. What we want by 24 hundred is the audience to be in flames!” Peter’s friend said as everyone else in the room erupted in laughter.</p>
      <p>It seems Pete was successful in getting his audience to lose control.</p>

      <p>“By the end it was [fire],” he revealed in an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> Stories update.</p>
      <p>“People rammed the stage and one fell hard…. oops,” he added.</p>
      <p>Back On Track is a charity that raises money for former service men and women from the armed forces to get specialist medical treatment following combat injuries.</p>
      <p>Originally the charity was set up to raise funds for veterans to enjoy go karting, but the charity evolved.</p>

      <p>Patron Dr Aamer Khan of The Harley Street Skin Clinic says: “We do still raise money to continue the racing, but as more support is pledged from generous donors across the spectrum.</p>
      <p>He continues: “It has allowed us to take the charity to another level – one where we can offer physical help and cosmetic treatments to help alleviate scarring, burns injuries as well as psychological trauma.”</p>

      <p>He adds: “The medical industry has been generous, too, by offering their services at little, or no cost. Back on Track may be small… but we are mighty!”</p>
      <p>Peter and Junior both had a great time at the event.</p>
      <p>“Amazing night with my wonderful son Junior,” Peter wrote as he shared photos with his son.</p>
