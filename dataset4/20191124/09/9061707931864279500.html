          <p>Branston Water Park started life as an opencast gravel pit and has become home to many species of plants and animals and is the perfect place for a stroll outdoors. The reed bed there is important to wildlife as it is one of the largest in Staffordshire.<br/>The site is a Local Natural Reserve and has also received the prestigious Green Flag award again having held the award since 2005 in recognition of the quality, cleanliness, safety and wildlife value of the site.<br/>In recent years the site has been improved with better signage, a small visitors' centre and parking. There is a level path running around the entire site giving excellent disabled access, a children's play area and toilets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2. Barton Marina</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2940159.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_SD_TEM_250918PLaces_of_Interest11JPG.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Barton Marina opened for business in 2001 and is home to more than 300 narrowboats linked to the Trent and Mersey Canal. Woodland covers much of the 90-acre site, intersected by a network of paths and bridges.</p>
          <p>Prior to 1994, a visitor to the Barton Marina site would have found wheat growing or cattle grazing.</p>
          <p>During the next three years, more than one million tonnes of sand and gravel were excavated to create the marina and two fishing lakes.</p>
          <p>The Waterfront Pub, now a popular local with a reputation for good food and a large selection of drinks, came into being in 2007.</p>
          <p>Other eating places, quality shops and a cinema quickly followed, all built in the same Victorian warehouse style using reclaimed timber and brick.</p>
          <p>Shops include Nero e Bianco; John Partridge; Bluewater; Alyssa and ceramic painting at The Mug Tug, and you're spoiled for choice for food with a Thai restaurant, Nipa Thai; Barton Marina Cafe; The Apple Tree and the Red Carpet Cinema Bar <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/secret-service-waterfront-barton-2761250">all accompanying The Waterfront</a>.</p>

          <h4>3. Tutbury Castle</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2803522.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_SD_TEM_250918PLaces_of_Interest22JPG.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Tutbury Castle sits on wooded slopes overlooking the winding River Dove, with spectacular views across the plain of the Dove to the beautiful Derbyshire hills.</p>
          <p>Its commanding view and natural defensive position makes this an obvious site for a castle.</p>
          <p>Occupied since the Stone Age, the castle is first recorded in 1071, as one of the new castles built to stamp the authority of the Norman conquerors across the Midlands.</p>
          <p>Since then, the castle has played an important part in English history on many occasions, in warfare and in peace.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/bohemian-rhapsody-tutbury-castle-2840539">The castle is best known</a> as one of the prisons of Mary Queen of Scots, who was held here on four occasions.</p>
          <p>It was here that she became involved in the plot that ultimately led to her bloody execution at Fotheringhay.</p>
          <p>Since 2000, the castle has taken on a new life, welcoming thousands of visitors every year.</p>
          <p>With historical re-enactment, archaeological excavation, an authentic Tudor garden and mediaeval herbery, the ‘haunted’ Great Hall and King’s Bedroom, and of course the tearoom, there’s something for everyone.</p>

          <h4>4. Calke Abbey</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.derbytelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article2093944.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_220114-GV-of-Alton-Towers-entrance-Uttoxeter-Uttoxeter.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>The National Trust <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/butterfly-conservation-calke-abbey-2948966">bills Calke Abbey</a> as the 'unstately stately home'.</p>
          <p>It is the house where time stood still, vividly portraying a period in the 20th century when many country houses did not survive to tell their story.</p>
          <p>Rather than restoring Calke to its former glory, the National Trust has undertaken necessary repairs to halt the decay of the house and its collections.</p>
          <p>As you wander through the mansion, you'll discover abandoned rooms, peeling wallpaper and a vast collection of strange and unique objects – presented exactly as they were found.</p>
          <p>Begin your journey in the entrance hall and explore the well-kept rooms at the front of the house, including the grand dining room, the library and the saloon, where you'll find an assortment of fascinating objects.</p>
          <p>As you make your way towards the servants' quarters, experience the sense of abandonment in the school room and Sir Vauncey's childhood bedroom.</p>

          <h4>5. Sudbury Hall and the Museum of Childhood</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.derbytelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article2093979.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/3_220114-GV-of-Alton-Towers-entrance-Uttoxeter-Uttoxeter.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Another National Trust property, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/sudbury-dalek-doctor-who-2095672">Sudbury Hall tells the story</a> of a house designed and built as a showpiece for 17th-century craftsmanship.</p>
          <p>George Vernon created the spirit of the Restoration period at Sudbury which has stood the test of time to be enjoyed today.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the Museum of Childhood's eight galleries celebrate the escapades and challenges of childhood in a whole new way.</p>
          <p>You don’t have to be young, only young at heart to enjoy the adventure.</p>
          <p>There's The Outdoor Adventure Gallery, where you can stroll down a Victorian street; The Work Gallery all about the realities of life for children employed through the ages; The Toys Gallery with its amazing array of toys; The Home Gallery which turns home life on its head and The School Gallery where you can cast your mind back to semolina dinners and school uniforms, sit up straight and pay attention for fear of the dreaded dunce hat!</p>

          <h4>6. Weston Park, Weston-under-Lizard, Shifnal</h4>
          <p>There is plenty for children to explore in the House at Weston Park, through a selection of trails.</p>
          <p>The House operates on a free-flow basis on a Sunday afternoon and by guided tour every 45 minutes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons.</p>
          <p>A most welcoming stately home, much of its appeal stems from the fact that Weston Park was the beloved seat of the Earls of Bradford since the 17th Century.</p>
          <p>Weston was gifted to the nation by Richard, the seventh and present Earl, and, with the aid of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the collection is now in the care of the Trustees of The Weston Park Foundation.</p>
          <p>From the Front Hall, with its tribute to the 3rd Earl’s love of horses, the Victorian Library furnished with more than 3,000 books, the unique Gobelin tapestries, specially commissioned for the House, to the stunning Dining Room, which houses one of the country’s most impressive collections of paintings including works by renowned artists such as Sir Anthony Van Dyck.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>7. Spode Museum Trust Heritage Centre</h4>
          <p>The Spode Museum Trust Heritage Centre opened in 2012 in one of the period buildings on the Spode site in Stoke.</p>
          <p>It doubled in size in 2016 and expanded further in 2017 with improved visitor facilities, exhibition and gallery spaces, new Heritage Centre Shop and the Blue Willow Tea Room.</p>
          <p>Admission to the Heritage Centre is free and includes the main exhibition areas, Centre Space Gallery, demonstrations of painting and transfer printing on ceramics and the Heritage Centre Shop.</p>
          <p>Guided tours of the Spode factory site (dependent upon current conditions) and the Blue Room are available at all times for a small charge.</p>
          <p>The Heritage Centre Shop sells antique and vintage Spode and Copeland ceramics, ceramics and craft items from local artists, high quality art prints reproduced from the original copperplates in the Spode Museum Trust archives, ceramic related reference books and much more.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Monkey Forest is the perfect way to spend a morning or afternoon and is great for all the family.</p>
          <p>Most visitors spend a few hours within the monkey enclosure and are free to re-enter as many times as they wish during their trip.</p>
          <p>The woodland walk is just less than a mile long and there are multiple information boards along the way.</p>
          <p>Knowledgeable guides are situated throughout the forest to help answer any questions you may have during your trip and to ensure the park rules are followed.</p>

          <h4>9. Trentham Gardens</h4>
          <p>If you don't fancy monkeying around, why not take a stroll around the beautiful gardens at Trentham?</p>
          <p>The contemporary revival of the famous Italian Gardens was led by renowned designer and multi-Chelsea gold-medal winner Tom Stuart-Smith.</p>
          <p>To the east of the Italian Gardens are the Rivers of Grass and the adjacent Floral Labyrinth.</p>
          <p>Both these schemes were designed by eminent Dutch plantsman, and Chelsea gold-medal winner, Piet Oudolf.</p>
          <p>At the centre of Trentham Gardens is the mile long, Capability Brown designed, Trentham Lake.</p>
          <p>Take the circular lakeside walk all the way round as it takes you aside the River Trent, by the bird hide, through the cascading weir and along atmospheric trails, featuring vast meadow schemes by Nigel Dunnett and the team who were responsible for the stunning wildflower plantings at the Olympic Park.</p>
          <p>These were chosen for seasonal interest and environmental suitability.</p>
          <p>And when you've finished your walk, you'll be spoiled for choice where to eat and drink, with cafes inside the gardens or in the adjoining shopping village.</p>

          <p>In 1984 Britain's first alpine style cable car transport system was installed.</p>
          <p>Rising from the valley floor, the observation cars transport you in comfort and safety and allow stunning views of the Derwent Valley and surrounding Peak District.</p>
          <p>At the end of your cable car ride, you can enjoy spectacular show caverns, the fossil factory, Victoria Prospect Tower, adventure playgrounds, the Tinker's Shaft viewing platform and some beautiful walks.</p>
