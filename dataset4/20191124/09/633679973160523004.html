      <p>Volunteers of the SA Whale Disentanglement Network (SAWDN) were activated on Saturday, following reports of a whale carcass entangled in the fishing nets of a fishing boat approximately 7 nautical miles off-shore of the Port of Port Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Craig Lambinon says after being released from fishing ropes, but still entangled in fishing nets, the carcass of the 11-meter Brydes Whale was towed to Coega harbour, with the permission of the harbour authorities, where the NSRI assisted in the recovery of the carcass to a landing zone to cut the remainder of the fishing nets.</p>
      <p>He says NSRI sea rescue craft then towed the whale carcass out to the deep sea where it was released.</p>
      <p>Lambinon says samples from the carcass were collected for the Department of Environmental Affairs and marine scientists.</p>
