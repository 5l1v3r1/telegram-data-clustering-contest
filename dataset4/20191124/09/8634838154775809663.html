      <p>"Meanwhile our recovery team is in collaboration with the maritime police and beach management units for the possible sighting and recovery of the body. Our sympathies to the affected family," read an excerpt of the press release.</p>

      <p>According to eyewitnesses, the unidentified middle-aged man, who also seemed not to be in his right senses, ran fast as if he was going to board MV Jambo, which was at the time loading passengers on the mainland side,</p>
      <p>However, he fell short and plungedÂ into the deep water and started struggling to stay afloat. before he was rescued.</p>
