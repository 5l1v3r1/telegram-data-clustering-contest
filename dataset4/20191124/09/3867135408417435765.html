      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/stephanie-davey/" target="_blank">Stephanie Davey</a></address>
      <p>EVERETT — A new leader is set to take over the YMCA of Snohomish County as it moves one of its main branches to a more central location.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the organization announced Peyton Tune as its new president and CEO. He takes over for <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/life/a-ymca-lifer-reflects-as-his-40-year-career-draws-to-a-close/">Scott Washburn</a>, who’s retiring after 11 years in the position and 40 years with the organization.</p>
      <p>Tune is currently the chief operating officer and executive vice president of Valley of the Sun YMCA in Phoenix, Arizona. He’s been in that role since 2016, but has worked for the YMCA for about 18 years.</p>
      <p>He’s learned about YMCA of Snohomish County from coworkers over the years.</p>
      <p>“The YMCA of Snohomish County has been building the next generation of changemakers,” he said in a prepared statement. “In addition to being the place where people stay healthy, we will continue to offer programs that develop the next generation right here.”</p>
      <p>In Phoenix, he’s been in charge of a $31 million budget and has come up with solutions to provide more services for members. There are about half a dozen YMCA centers in Snohomish County, with an annual budget of $26 million.</p>
      <p>He’ll begin the new job on Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>Offices for the YMCA of Snohomish County have been housed in the old Everett YMCA for almost a century. That branch <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/the-most-outstanding-building-in-everett/">opened in 1921</a> at the intersection of Rockefeller Avenue and California Street.</p>
      <p>That location closed about a week ago, and is moving to 4370 Colby Ave. The regional offices are going to be in the United Way of Snohomish County building on McDougal Avenue.</p>
      <p>The new Everett YMCA is set to open Dec. 1.</p>
