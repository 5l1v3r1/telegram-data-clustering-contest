      <h1>'Like being handed a card stuffed with divorce papers' - Neal Ardley suffers Notts County anniversary to forget</h1>
      <h2>Magpies were beaten 2-1 by Aldershot on the date Magpies boss was appointed last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:43:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>As far as anniversary celebrations go, this was pretty much the equivalent of a devoted husband receiving a card from the wife only to find she had stuffed it full of divorce papers.</p>
      <p>Twelve months to the day he was appointed as Notts County manager, Neal Ardley hoped it would be an occasion to remember only for it to end up being gatecrashed by a bitter sense of frustration.</p>
      <p>And if the result against Aldershot was not bad enough during this miserable afternoon, a bad back left him in such excruciating discomfort that he could hardly walk but for the help of some anti-inflammatories.</p>
      <p>But you can bet that physical pain Ardley experienced would have undoubtedly been rivalled by the mental anguish of his team's performance here as they suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>To compound his woe, Notts were architects of their own demise after two crucial mistakes in possession meant Aldershot were gifted their victory just a week after they were battered 6-1 at Dagenham.</p>
      <p>While there has been much to admire about the way Notts have played this season, a style based on retention of the ball comes attached with risk if you don't look after it well enough.</p>
      <p>And for the second week running, they learned a savage lesson in what can happen when you fail to recognise areas of risk and safety when it comes to passing the ball.</p>
      <p>The unlucky victims this week were Enzio Boldewijn and Ben Turner who were both guilty of mistakes which proved that even in the fifth tier of English football, you can, and will be, ruthlessly punished.</p>
      <p>But having hobbled up the steps of the EBB Stadium to offer his own insight, Ardley’s biggest concern was the lack of intensity which he felt blighted the entire 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>Not for the first time this season, he had to remind his players that Notts are the scalp for every team in the division given the size of the club and the history attached to it.</p>
      <p>Aldershot wanted to be among those to have savoured victory over the world’s oldest professional club and it showed by the way they pressed with incredible energy.</p>

      <p>But that level of desire was not reciprocated and as good as some of these players are, it’s the age old adage that hard work will always beat talent when talent does not work hard.</p>
      <p>Having just lost five of their last 21 games, Ardley denied his players had slipped into a comfort zone or they felt the league was too easy, but that will be under scrutiny when they face Boreham Wood on Tuesday,</p>
      <p>Nobody is disputing they are a good side because we have seen some real brilliance from them since the season began, but quality alone will not dig them out of a hole.</p>
      <p>Indeed, on salaries far less than what Notts are paying, Aldershot proved that the real currency lies in the hard yards as personified with their opening goal.</p>
      <p>Boldewijn, with his back to goal in the middle of the pitch, thought he could turn, but was instantly pressed in a position in which Notts were always going to be exposed if he lost the possession.</p>
      <p>He was eventually out-muscled and from that counter attack Sam Slocombe thought he had given Notts a reprieve when he made a good save to deny Connor Shields.</p>
      <p>But from the following cross, Mohamed Bettamer produced a thumping header in a situation that could have been avoided had Boldewijn just played another pass.</p>

      <p>In fairness to Notts they bludgeoned their way back into the game through Kyle Wootton whose seventh goal of the season puts him level with both Wes Thomas and Kristian Dennis.</p>
      <p>He stuck out a foot to convert a shot from Michael Doyle that had looked to be heading wide until the on-loan Scunthorpe striker showed excellent predatory instinct.</p>
      <p>From that point you felt that Notts were going to seize control of the game, but every time they played a pass, space was often shut down by Aldershot’s running.</p>
      <p>There was no better example of that when it came to the goal which eventually won the game although from a defensive point of view it was an unmitigated disaster.</p>
      <p>Turner has been exceptional for Notts this season, but when trying to play out from the back he spotted Michael Doyle in a position when he had Alfy Whittingham in his back.</p>
      <p>It was an area of risk that could have been turned into one of safety had he just lumped the ball 70 yards down the pitch, particularly as it was close to half-time.</p>
      <p>But instead he played a hurried and powerful pass to Doyle who could not get it under control and was then outmuscled by Whittingham who raced through to beat Slocombe.</p>
      <p>In fairness to Notts they did pass the ball much better in the second half but it was a mistake that nearly led to an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Wes Thomas had pounced on mis-kick to burst clear through on goal and while he did everything right in terms of firing across the goalkeeper, Mitch Walker made a brilliant save.</p>
      <p>That was as good as it got for Notts in terms of clear-cut chances as Ardley was denied the victory he would have been hoping for on his anniversary.</p>
