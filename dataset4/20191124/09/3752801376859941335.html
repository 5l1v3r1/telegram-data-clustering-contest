      <h1>WATCH: Joburg's fire-trap Bank of Lisbon building comes down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:48:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>The Bank of Lisbon building in Johannesburg, in which three firefighters lost their lives last year while battling a blaze, is no more.Â </p>
      <p>It was imploded in a controlled explosion on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The Gauteng provincial government made the decision to implode it after a structural assessment on the building was conducted, following the fatal fire in September 2018.</p>
      <p>The 31-storey building was situated at 37 Pixley ka Isaka Seme Street, in Johannesburg central.</p>
      <p>"After an assessment was conducted by structural engineers, it was discovered that the fire caused severe damage to the slabs of the burnt floors and posed a threat of collapsing if left [unchecked]," infrastructure development department head Bethuel Netshiswinzhe said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Simphiwe Moropane, Mduduzi Ndlovu and Khathutshelo Muedi were the firefighters who died on duty on that day.</p>
      <p>They were among 48 people, including four police officers, who were on the scene to extinguish the blaze.</p>
      <p>Jet Demolition (Pty) Ltd, who won the bid to implode the building, will complete the clearing of the site in March 2020.</p>
