      <p>He told<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-22/tweed-heads-body-found-in-sleeping-bag/11730258"> ABC</a>: “The movements and the history of the victim is something that we are in the early stages of establishing.”</p>
      <p>“We are very keen to speak to any person that was in Jack Evans Boat Harbour yesterday evening and this morning who might have seen something or know anything about this.”</p>
      <p>“We do want to establish where this man is from and how he came to be in the state he is in now.”</p>

      <p>A source claimed to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10409277/im-a-celeb-security-hunt-killer/">The Sun: “</a>The celebs are being watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a team of staff and our security measures are incredibly tight.”</p>
      <p>“So there is zero chance of anyone sneaking into camp. But of course it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime.”</p>
      <p>The area is extremely remote, and was threatened by forest fires earlier this year.</p>
