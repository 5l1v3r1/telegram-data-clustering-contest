      <p>Cities are feeling the pinch of successful 1- 976 vote. They could also start collecting taxes from all multi-house projects that are scattered all over the cities and exempt from taxes for eight years or so after being built. How about big churches start paying.</p>
      <p>We figure taxes are our duty and pay them because that is how the system works to keep things functioning. Everybody pays. Not the case in all circumstances I found out when I saw exempt multi-family buildings while searching for what the city collects taxes on.</p>
      <p>What other developer structures are we seeing in Everett that get tax breaks? The newest ones on Broadway? The marina expansion? Did I-976 tax funds fit in with the city paying for that bridge over West Marine View Drive to name a couple.</p>
      <p>We should have been able to vote on these expansions, not just pay for them. The light rail project was not fair. Many were confused by the language on the ballot. That is one reason why so many are against the car tab increases.</p>
      <p>The Nov. 17 editorial in The Herald (“<a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/editorial-voters-spoke-but-i-976-must-get-court-review/">Voters spoke, but I-976 must get court review</a>”) makes it sound like we-re putting a dirty hand in the city purse by refusing to be over-taxed again when it was approved twice before.</p>
      <p>Thank you Tim Eyman. Planners and future growth forecasters have not given the population a fair shake in my opinion. We are over-crowded, over-taxed in the name of revenue. If a vote is taken to remove the fairness of I-976 it will show the people have no voice and our democracy has been smothered.</p>
