      <p>It's been an action-packed weekend and here are your rugby morning headlines for Sunday November 24</p>
      <h3>Injury blow for Wales hopeful</h3>
      <p>Wales newcomer Willis Halaholo has become an injury doubt for Wayne Pivac's first game in charge.</p>
      <p>The Cardiff Blues centre, who has qualified on residency grounds, had to be helped from Arms Park pitch during the agonising <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-leicester-live-score-17306224">14-11 loss to Leicester in the Challenge Cup.</a></p>
      <p>Halaholo was called into the Wales squad on Tuesday and was likely to feature in Saturday's clash with Warren Gatland's Barbarians at Principality Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But his participation has been thrown into doubt with medics monitoring the situation on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Blues coach John Mulvihill remained upbeat, saying: "He is icing the knee. Hopefully he will be okay."</p>

      <h3>Tipuric opens up on his battle with Warburton</h3>
      <p>Welsh star Justin Tipuric has opened up for the first time on his battle for the number seven jersey with Sam Warburton.</p>
      <p>In a wide-ranging interview with WalesOnline, world-class flanker Tipuric explained he simply had to adopt a pragmatic approach when Warren Gatland opted for Warburton as skipper and his number one.</p>
      <p>“Selection going against you is just the way the game can go," he says. “Everyone wants to start and when I was younger I might have been a bit more frustrated with not beginning a match.</p>
      <p>“But the older you get the more you are able to put things into perspective and think how lucky you are just to be playing for your country.</p>
      <p>“Even today there’s a lot of competition, with so many people who could start at No. 7.</p>
      <p>“Before, everyone used to say we had loads of outside halves. But, for me, the crazy strength in depth in Wales now is at seven.”</p>

      <h3>Biggar 'as good as anyone in the world'</h3>
      <p>Wales fly-half Dan Biggar was showered with more plaudits after his dramatic Heineken Cup matchwinning kick for Northampton against Benetton.</p>
      <p>Biggar landed a difficult penalty in the 85th minute to snatch the game 35-32, leading Northampton director of rugby Chris Boyd to say: "He doesn't miss very often and in those key situations he's as good as anyone in the world.</p>
      <p>"We knew if we could get some field position and force an error or find a hole, three points would be enough to win."</p>
      <p>Those were the only soothing words from Boyd, though, who rapped of his team's performance: "We were just miles off our game, which was really disappointing. It was probably our worst effort of the year."</p>

      <h3>Crisis club Saracens make confidence hit Ospreys pay</h3>
      <p>The Ospreys were on the wrong end of a Heineken Cup hiding against crisis club Saracens, falling to a 44-3 thrashing with a solitary James Hook penalty their only points.</p>
      <p>The European and English champions have been hit by a whopping points deduction and hefty fine this season, but director of rugby Mark McCall said after the win: "It felt much more like ourselves.</p>
      <p>"It is the first time the group has been together for five months and there has been a really positive atmosphere around the club because these lads like each other, so it's good we were able to put something on the field."</p>
      <p>Ospreys coach Allen Clarke said of his side: "There's undoubtedly a bit of self-belief missing among the group at the moment, based on the run we've been on."</p>
      <h3>And finally, how about this moment of Finn Russell genius</h3>
      <p>Scotland star Finn Russell scored a sensational try in his team Racing's 21-21 thriller in the other game in Pool 4.</p>
      <p>Receiving a pass just inside the Munster 22, the fly-half shaped as if to pass out wide... but then nutmegged his onrushing opponent with a clever grubber kick before going over for the try.</p>

      <p>It was an impish moment of genius that perfectly demonstrated Russell's flair.</p>
