      <h1>Rugby Australia issue statement following reports Foxtel could dump rugby union</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:44:08+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> have issued a statement following reports Foxtel could dump them despite a two decade long relationship.</p>
      <p>The Sydney Morning Herald report that the corporation have withdrawn a five year deal with RA.</p>
      <p>The loss of a lucrative contract would be a massive blow for the sport in Australia, whose TV deals already lag far behind the NRL. TV revenue is by far Rugby Australia’s biggest revenue spinner and it effectively underwrites <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> and the Wallabies.</p>
      <p>Rugby Australia state:</p>
      <p>“In relation to its media rights, Rugby Australia is currently in general discussions with the broader market about the rights for the period for 2021 to 2025.</p>
      <p>“No formal negotiations with the broader market have yet taken place.</p>
      <p>“Rugby Australia will commence a formal rights offer process at an appropriate time before the end of the current rights period.</p>
      <p>“Rugby has had a 25-year partnership with Fox Sports and continues to be in discussions with their key executives.”</p>
