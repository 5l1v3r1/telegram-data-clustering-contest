      <p>Hamilton Accies Academy duo Lewis Smith and Jamie Hamilton have both signed contract extensions until 2022.</p>
      <p>Winger Smith, 19, and defender Hamilton, 17, have both extended their contracts by two years.</p>
      <p>It's a timely boost for Accies ahead of today's Premiership clash with Rangers at New Douglas Park, and shows they have learned from the loss of impressive young players like Lewis Ferguson to Aberdeen.</p>

      <p>Smith and Hamilton, who have played for Scotland under-21s and 19s, respectively, have had a lot of interest from English clubs, with scouts watching them in several games.</p>
      <p>Hamilton head coach Brian Rice said: "It's very important that we try to keep hold of the young lads who are coming through, especially the ones that are making an impact at first-team level, and to be fair the two lads have been brilliant so far. It's only the start of their pathway - they've got in the first team, the hardest part is staying there, and I have explained all of that to them.</p>
      <p>"Their attitude has been fantastic, they train well and they're performing well, so they deserve their new contracts."</p>
      <p>Accies have been given further good news after captain Brian Easton returned to training this week, and could play in today's game, which kicks off at 12.15pm.</p>
