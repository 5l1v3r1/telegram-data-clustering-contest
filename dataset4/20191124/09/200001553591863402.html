      <h1>SPL coach, once a Celtic player, says club can emulate rebirth of Rangers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:54:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/sean-lunt/" target="_blank">Sean Lunt</a></address>
      <p>Massimo Donati, once of Celtic, has backed his old club, Palermo, to rise back up the divisions, just like Rangers have done in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Rangers were famously relegated to the bottom tier in 2012 with the new club forced to start from the bottom following liquidation the previous season.</p>
      <p>They spent the subsequent four years battling back up through the divisions before finally securing promotion back to the top flight in 2016.</p>
      <p>They’ve since set about establishing themselves as title challengers in the SPFL, with Rangers currently second in the table but level on points with first-placed Celtic.</p>
      <p>Given his Celtic connections, Donati has watched Rangers’ rise and fall like the rest of us and has now experienced it with one of his old clubs, Palermo.</p>
      <p>The Italian side were relegated down to Serie D this summer after The FIGC’s Federal Council punished them for administrative non-compliance.</p>
      <p>They must now fight their way back up the divisions, but Donati, who is now a coach with Kilmarnock, believes they can do that, just as Rangers have done in Scotland.</p>
      <p><i>“Yes, it’s true, even here we talked about it,”</i> he told <a href="https://www.ilovepalermocalcio.com/gds-lintervista-al-doppio-ex-donati-i-rosanero-possono-tornare-in-tre-anni-in-a-come-ha-fatto-il-parma-notizia-in-scozia/">Gazzetta Dello Sport</a> when asked about the situation and comparisons with Rangers.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“A club like Palermo doesn’t go unnoticed and if something happens like that it’s news.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Of course, not much has been said about it, but the news has also arrived here and for those who have played in Palermo they cannot fail to displease us.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Napoli, Fiorentina, Parma and other clubs have done it; I don’t see why Palermo can’t manage to make it.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But we need an important and healthy society behind us if all the right requirements are met, even the Rosanero can do it.”</i>
      </p>
