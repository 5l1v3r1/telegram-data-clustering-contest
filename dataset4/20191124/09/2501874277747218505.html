      <p>Jack and Jolene are still available for adoption they are at Petco in the 5 points shopping center in Santa Barbara. I stopped by yesterday and they were not their perky exciting selves. Jolene especially is a people cat she is a lap kitty that would love nothing more than to be by your side, a true companion kitty, while Jack is also very sweet he’s more independent.</p>
      <p>These two sweet fur babies do not need to be adopted together but please share this post, they have been there almost 2 weeks and from what we can tell they have had no interest.</p>
      <p>Both Jack and Jolene are going to be fairly large cats as they do have bangle in their mix. Both are so sweet and very human oriented if you’re looking for a wonderful companion cat please consider Jolene!</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for a silly happy go lucky goofball please consider Jack!</p>
      <p>Both of these kitties are now 4 1/2 months old fully vetted and ready to go home today.</p>
