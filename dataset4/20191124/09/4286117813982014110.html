      <p>NCP leader and Sharad Pawar's nephew shot to the limelight overnight on Saturday when he took oath as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra alongside Devendra Fadnavis, who was sworn-in as the chief minister for a second time thanks to Ajit Pawar pledge of support. However, 24 hours later, Ajit Pawar's promised support to BJP seems to be dwindling as most MLAs who went with him are back in the NCP fold.</p>
      <p>The NCP has claimed that they have at least 49 MLAs in the party fold and three of its five MLAs, who went 'missing' on Saturday after attending the swearing in of Devendra Fadnavis, have been contacted and they are with the party.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Aaj Tak in an interview on Sunday, Sanjay Raut said, "They thought Ajit Pawar is a big leader and the entire NCP would follow him. However, that is far from the truth. Ajit Pawar took some 12-14 MLAs with him on Saturday and most of them are back with Sharad Pawar. They do not have the numbers in their favour."</p>
      <p>Till Sunday morning, five NCP MLAs - Daulat Daroda (Shahapur), Nitin Pawar (Kalwan), Narhari Zhirwal (Dindori), Babasaheb Patil (Ahmedpur), Anil Patil (Amalner) - were among those who were missing, party spokesperson Nawab Malik said.</p>
      <p>However, NCP has managed to contact Anil Patil, Babasaheb Patil and Daroda.</p>
      <p>NCP MLA Daulat Daroda, who was declared missing and a complaint was also lodged with the police resurfaced on Sunday afternoon. Daroda said, "I'm safe. I won the election on the clock symbol (NCP) so there's no question of changing the party. Whatever decision Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar take, I am with that. Do not believe in any rumours."</p>
      <p>NCP MLA Manikrao Kokate has also reached the Renaissance Hotel where other MLAs of the party are lodged. Kokate had reportedly accompanied Ajit Pawar to the Governor's residence on Saturday morning and was missing since.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal has confirmed that they have 49 MLAs with them while more are willing to come back to stand by Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have moved the Supreme Court seeking an immediate floor test in the Maharashtra assembly to prove their majority. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has claimed they the newly formed alliance has the support of 165 MLAs.</p>
      <p>If NCP's claims come true, Ajit Pawar will be left isolated with most of his MLAs going back to the Sharad Pawar camp.</p>
      <p>The Pawar family has in the meanwhile started making efforts to reach out to Ajit Pawar and convince him to resign as the deputy chief minister in the BJP government.</p>
      <p>NCP legislature party leader Jayant Patil said attempts were being made to convince Ajit Pawar to reconsider his decision of rebelling against the NCP.</p>
      <p>Pawar was removed as the NCP's legislature unit leader on Saturday, hours after he joined hands with the BJP in a coup and took oath as the deputy of Devendra Fadnavis.</p>
