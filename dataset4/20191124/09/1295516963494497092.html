      <p>Chadwick Boseman has quickly blown up in the film world, finding stardom playing characters like Jackie Robinson, James Brown and most recently, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-panther-film/">Black Panther</a> in the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. One of his most recent roles, however, has more in common with a different MCU hero.</p>
      <p>Boseman’s character in <i>21 Bridges</i> is basically Captain America if he became a cop instead of a soldier -- it's great.</p>

      <p>He’s shown being superhero-level tough. At one point, he gets up and goes into a full sprint after getting hit by a car head-on. He’s also incredibly adept with his gun, carefully dispatching targets with ease throughout the film. He even slides across the ground on his knees in one scene, dodging a hail of gunfire while still fatally wounding his target. He’s accurate, rarely firing without hitting who he intends. But his restraint with his gun might be his most superheroic quality.</p>
      <p>In the present day, an adult Andre is first shown being interrogated by Internal Affairs. It’s revealed that during a recent case, he was forced to kill a suspect on the streets. This is his eighth killing in nine years. Unlike many officers, he doesn’t seem to show any outright anger or frustration over his actions, nor is he vindictive or triumphant. He’s calmly self-assured because he never kills someone who wasn’t actively trying to kill him.</p>
      <p>He doesn’t regret his actions but doesn’t relish them either, which is the aspect of the character that makes him heroic. It’s a level of restraint that the rest of the police in the film aren’t shown to share as they unload gunfire in populated areas and use helicopter-mounted machine guns to try and kill a single guy. This restraint is also Andre’s greatest strength as his willingness to reason with his enemy is how he finds out about the conspiracy at the heart of the 85th police precinct.</p>

      <h3>THE CAPTAIN AMERICA OF THE NYPD</h3>

      <p>Throughout the film, Andre is critical of the shoot-first-ask-questions-later tactics of the rest of the police officers. Even after the loss of eight officers, Andre remains calm and collected. He’s also impossible for the corrupt cops to bring down to their level. Their attempts to rationalize cops' participation in the drug trade fall on deaf ears. Andre is so convinced that he is in the right -- and he is, considering Captain McKenna (J.K. Simmons) and his cops are actively part of the drug trade -- that he even sent the evidence to the press and the police before he ever confronted them in the first place.</p>
      <p>There is nothing that could be said that would make Andre believe otherwise, but he gives the corrupt officers the chance to surrender, something none of them take him up on except for his partner Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller). Essentially, Andre is the NYPD version of Captain America -- restrained but not unwilling. He respects the humanity of his enemies while holding them accountable for their actions with a moral code that won’t bend and a body that can seemingly survive anything thrown at him.</p>

        <i>Directed by Brian Kirk and starring Chadwick Boseman, Sienna Miller, Stephan James, Taylor Kitsch and J.K. Simmons, 21 Bridges is now playing nationwide.</i>
