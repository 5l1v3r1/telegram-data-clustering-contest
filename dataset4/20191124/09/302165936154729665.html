      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 24 — A woman believed to have belonged to the so-called Islamic State (IS) group and her three children has arrived back in her home country Germany, police told AFP today.</p>
      <p>The woman is the first adult female IS member to have been returned through official channels to Germany from Syria.</p>
      <p>Named only as Laura H., the 30-year-old from Hesse state arrived at Frankfurt airport late yesterday on a flight from from Erbil, Iraq.</p>
      <p>While Laura H. was not immediately arrested on arrival, she remains the subject of an investigation on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation as well as failure to properly care for her children, news weekly <i>Der Spiegel</i> reported citing security sources.</p>
      <p>Her passport has been confiscated and she has been banned from leaving the country, while her children are being entrusted to a close reative, Spiegel added.</p>
      <p>According to the magazine, she travelled in 2016 from Giessen in central Germany to Syria with her children and her husband, a Somalia-born US citizen, where she joined IS.</p>
      <p>She had already been linked to Salafist (Islamic fundamentalist) circles in Germany and allegedly posted an online call for aid donations for Syria that in reality went to a fundamentalist group.</p>
      <p>Following her husband’s reported killing and her own capture by Kurdish security forces, Laura H. claims to have turned away from IS ideology.</p>
      <p>A US aid organisation helped bring her to Erbil from the Al-Hol prison camp in northeastern Syria, Spiegel reported.</p>
      <p>Kurdish authorities have repeatedly urged Western countries to repatriate their nationals linked to IS, but they have been largely reluctant to do so.</p>
      <p>A Turkish invasion of northern Syria last month sparked concern of a mass breakout from Kurdish-held jails and camps.</p>
      <p>Germany had already brought home a handful of orphans, but no adults until yesterday.</p>
      <p>Austria, Belgium, Britain and France have also repatriated some orphaned children, while the United States has repatriated several women and their children.</p>
      <p>An Albanian boy taken by his mother to join IS in Syria returned to his home in Italy earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kosovo have all repatriated dozens of women and children. — AFP</p>
