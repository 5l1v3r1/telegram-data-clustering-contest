      <p>But Steven Gerrard wants his players to keep the blinkers on so they don’t veer off course.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> gaffer has ordered his side to ignore the hurdles in the distance and focus on what’s right in front of them.</p>
      <p>And that means taking it one game at a time instead of racing ahead of themselves.</p>
      <p>The temptation may be to look ahead to Thursday’s Europa League clash away to Feyenoord — where a positive result will book a spot alongside <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> in the last 32.</p>
      <p>But Gerrard wants all eyes to be on <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14917/hamilton/">Hamilton</a> for their Premiership clash.</p>

      <p>The Light Blues face a block of ten games before the winter break — a cup final against Celtic, two European ties and seven crunch Premiership clashes.</p>
      <p>But the Ibrox boss wants clear heads as his side gallops towards the finishing line on all fronts.</p>
      <p>He said: “You have to picture scenarios where you have a run in the League Cup and go to the wire in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>“We knew we could be in a situation where we have ten or 11 games in a six-week period.</p>
      <p>“So two things are important — volume and quality. That’s what we tried to do when we put the squad together.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to say we were the finished article last summer because people will then jump all over you if you have a setback or bump in the road.</p>
      <p>“I like to do the talking when the games begin and so far we’re doing all right. I need to keep driving everything and make sure the players are focused on the next game.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we set the scene. We show them the schedule and what’s ahead of them.</p>

      <p>“But it’s important the players put blinkers on and worry about the next three points — that’s all that matters.</p>
      <p>“We have to beat Hamilton away on astroturf, live on TV, with an early kick-off. That’s all we have to focus ourselves on.</p>
      <p>“Is it right for other people to talk about the next block of fixtures and the challenges within it? One hundred per cent yes.</p>
      <p>“But it would be very naive of me to start talking about what I have to do at Celtic Park or against Young Boys or in the final. That would take my focus right off Hamilton.</p>
      <p>“Celtic play in the league before us and it’s impossible to ignore their result.</p>
      <p>“The players will all be aware of the score, but it’s vital you focus on your job and what you can control.</p>
      <p>“Come kick-off against Hamilton, we’ll know exactly what’s happened. We had a period at the beginning of the last block, in this situation, where we were slow out of the blocks.</p>
      <p>“It cost us. That’s the reason why we have to switch the focus on ourselves.”</p>

      <p>Gerrard knows the run of games ahead could define their entire season.</p>
      <p>The Rangers boss sees getting to finals and reaching the Europa League group stages as a reward for his players’ efforts so far this season.</p>
      <p>Some people struggle when the pressure is ramped up, but Gerrard insists his squad have the mental toughness to get the job done when it counts.</p>
      <p>He added: “There’s no getting away from it — there’s some really tough, challenging games coming up within the next block of fixtures.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve earned that by winning a cup semi-final and having something to play for in Europe.</p>
      <p>“So it’s a very exciting period of games. It’s one I’m looking forward to and I know my team are as well.</p>
      <p>“I watch them closely every day. We had a couple of injuries recently but the players concerned­ are back fit already and raring to go.</p>
      <p>“There was a real hunger in the way we finished the last block of games.</p>

      <p>“And that means people at this club are excited about these games. They are looking forward to getting their teeth into them. But it’s a big challenge.</p>
      <p>“I never doubt this group of players. I’ve signed them for a reason — because I have belief in them and confidence.</p>
      <p>“We’re a good team, we’re a strong team and we’ve proved we can deal with the tough challenges that come our way.</p>
      <p>“If you take all the fixtures in isolation, I have confidence that we are going to be good enough.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to be in a good position to compete during the challenges that face us — right across the board.</p>
      <p>“But there’s no need to focus too much on the block because we had a successful block last time by taking each game in isolation.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard saw several of his key men feature for their countries over the last week.</p>
      <p>He admits he may freshen up his side this afternoon with Thursday in mind, but insists that he won’t be making wholesale changes.</p>
      <p>He said: “Do I have an eye on Thursday? Yes, but not too much. I know Feyenoord is seen as the glamour tie but the important game is Hamilton.</p>
      <p>“Obviously lads have been playing internationals, some are a little bit tight. They’re fit, they’re available, but there are little things we have been monitoring.</p>
      <p>“There’s numerous things I have to juggle around in terms of being ahead of the game and what I’m thinking about further down the road.</p>
      <p>“That doesn’t mean I’ll pick a weaker team. It’s just what works in my eyes.”</p>
