        <b>RB Leipzig could be the surprise destination for sought-after striker Erling Haaland, due to their relationship with his current club RB Salzburg.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has been in incredible goal-scoring form this season, netting 26 times in just 18 games for Salzburg, including seven in four in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the teenager has caught the attention of many of the biggest teams across Europe, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> both credited with having an interest in the prolific forward.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils were thought to have an advantage in the race for the young Norwegian as manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> managed him while they were both at Molde and has a good relationship with the player.</p>
      <p>However, another relationship could make the difference, as Salzburg and Leipzig are both owned by Red Bull and they operate as sister clubs.</p>

      <p>Players such as Naby Keita and Dayot Upamecano have moved from Salzburg to Leipzig in recent years and Haaland could be the next to do so.</p>
      <p>German publication <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/vereine/rb-leipzig/erling-haaland-red-bull-salzburg-poker-transfer-66134768.sport.html">Sport Bild</a> report that Haaland has a clause in his contract that allows Leipzig to buy him for just €30m (£25.7m), which is a lot less than the striker’s market value.</p>
      <p>Leipzig manager Markus Krosche said: ‘The boy is a very good player. Both in the league and in the Champions League, he does an exceptionally good job. Of course, we are already looking around for the summer.’</p>
      <p>Given the interest in the Norway international, and the financial might of the clubs tracking him, a fee of nearer £80m would be expected if another club were to sign him.</p>
      <p>Salzburg may prefer to sell their star man elsewhere, but their owners may have other ideas and take him to Leipzig before selling him on for a huge fee in the coming years.</p>
      <p>Bild report that the player’s father, former Manchester City midfielder Alf-Inge Haaland, would prefer his son to move to a club where he is likely to start regularly, and sees Leipzig as good career progression for Erling.</p>
