        <b>Graham Foster (Andrew Scarborough) is taking his life in his hands in Emmerdale by taking on the mighty Kim Tate (Claire King) and, now that he has fallen for Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) and turned his back on her, she isn’t about to let him get away with it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Claire said: ‘I personally always thought that Graham was the one who was in love with Kim – and that Kim loved him but wasn’t in love with him. They’ve both had their dalliances in the past and they’ve allowed that, because they had an open relationship.</p>
      <p>‘But this seems to be different and I think Kim is very worried that Graham might be falling in love with Rhona. That’s always a bit taboo, as far as the Kim-Graham relationship is concerned.</p>
      <p>‘Kim is now starting to feel threatened and I think she’s suddenly realising that she might have deeper feelings for Graham than she thought. In an ideal world, Kim expects Graham to keep running back. He has done that every single time in the past. They usually get over it, move on and it’s business as usual.</p>

      <p>‘But I don’t think Graham wants that this time. He just wants a quieter life. Kim feels threatened by this. She’ll no doubt try to get them out of the village, so the relationship is out of sight.’</p>

      <p>As Kim gets everyone together in the Woolpack for a party, she introduces a guest of honour – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-kim-tate-takes-bitter-revenge-by-revealing-a-big-secret-about-graham-foster-11000168/">and it’s someone who Graham is very shocked to see</a>.</p>
      <p>Claire teased: ‘Graham knows exactly how Kim works, probably more than anybody else in the world. They’ve known each other for 25 years and been together nearly as long.</p>

      <p>‘I think Graham is going to dig his heels in and try to get back at Kim. She’ll try to top him and he’ll try to top her. Let’s put it this way, it’s not going to end happily. It’s not a healthy relationship but they have fantastic sex!’</p>
      <p>Oh well, there’s always that!</p>
      <p>It’s the beginning of the end for Graham as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/emmerdale-spoilers-graham-foster-exits-kim-tate-carries-shocking-revenge-11033821/">it was recently revealed that he would be leaving the show in dramatic circumstances</a> – and we reckon it’s fairly clear Kim will have a hand to play in his departure.</p>
