      <p>Flood-hit areas of the Midlands are bracing for more heavy rain as the Met Office issues weather warnings for the next five days.</p>
      <p>As Saturday's rain cleared north into Scotland and northern England, south west England and south Wales are preparing for downpours over the coming days - with yellow weather warnings in place in the region from Sunday until Wednesday.</p>
      <p>By midweek, the East Midlands and South Yorkshire are also expecting a deluge, on top of the ground already flooded earlier this month, with a yellow weather warning, and the possibility of flooding, already in place.</p>
      <p>Remnants of a tropical storm could hit Birmingham by midweek and it's is also likely to get much colder and chilly air edges down from the Arctic.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, the Army was called in to assist stricken communities after towns and villages around Doncaster and Sheffield and parts of the Midlands were drenched by heavy downpours.</p>
      <p>Met Office weather forecaster Alex Burkill said: "The heavy rain that affected parts of England today has moved north and it's mainly across Scotland right now.</p>
      <p>"That's where we've got the warning for tonight, and the heaviest rain and greatest impacts will be there."</p>
      <p>Seven flood warnings are in place across England and Wales on Saturday, alongside 60 less severe flood alerts.</p>
      <p>Mr Burkill added: "Across the next five days we have got warnings for each [day].</p>
      <p>"[On Wednesday] it's covering that area of Yorkshire and Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, that area which saw the severe flooding.</p>
      <p>"At the moment, the rainfall is not expected to be particularly heavy for the time of year, but we are expecting it to be significant.</p>
      <p>"There are likely to be some impacts."</p>
      <p>There will be rain in Birmingham on Monday and it will become wetter and more breezy as the week progresses. Downpours are expected to be heavy by Wednesday as the remnants of tropical storm Sebastien sweep in from the Atlantic.</p>
