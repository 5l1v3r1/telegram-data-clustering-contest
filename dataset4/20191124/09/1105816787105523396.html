      <p>“Writing from a young woman’s perspective, Shakir broke the male-dominated mould of the time by being the first poet to use the Urdu word <i>larki</i> (girl) in her work, defying tradition by candidly expressing the female condition emotionally and realistically.”</p>
      <p>“An exceptionally accomplished student, Shakir was awarded a Master’s Degree in English Literature, Linguistics, Bank Management, a PhD in Bank Administration, as well as a Master’s in Public Administration from Harvard.</p>
