      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:00:43+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://gaadiwaadi.com/author/surendharm/" target="_blank">Surendhar M</a></address>
      <h3>Maruti Suzuki Alto 800, Wagon R, Swift, Dzire and Baleno complying with BSVI emission standards are offered with massive discounts this month</h3>
      <p>Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) began introducing BSVI compliant models in April 2019 and over the months, the largest carmaker in the country has been expanding its reach rapidly. Despite being new to the domestic market, they could not shy from the discount spree.</p>
      <p>The automobile industry has been witnessing massive sales slowdown throughout 2019 and the only way of recovery, at least partly, is to offer big discounts and benefits even for the popular cars and the companies are doing just that to garner new audience.</p>
      <p>In November 2019, the entry-level Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 is sold with Rs. 33,000 cash discount, Rs. 15,000 exchange bonus and Rs. 5,000 corporate discount adding to a total of Rs. 53,000 benefits. The Wagon R, on the other hand, comes with benefits of up to Rs. 25,000.</p>
