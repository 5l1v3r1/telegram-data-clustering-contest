        <b>According to reports, former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has decided that he will not return to management immediately, after the Premier League club sacked him earlier last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/roberto-martinez-wanted-spurs-job-20946135"><i>Daily Star</i></a> claims that the Argentine has been left “heartbroken” by Spurs Chairman Daniel Levy’s decision to sack him as manager, thereby bringing his five-and-a-half-year spell at the North London outfit to an abrupt end in the middle of the ongoing 2019-20 season.\</p>
      <p>The English news agency further adds that the 47-year-old always had a close relationship with Levy, and hence, he never expected to be shown the door mid-season.</p>
      <p>It has also been just five months after he led the club to their first-ever Champions League final, which makes matters worse.</p>
      <p><i>Daily Star</i> also says that although Pochettino has since been linked to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, the ex-Southampton and Espanyol coach is “unlikely to rush into a new job” any time soon.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, Bayern Munich recently sacked their own manager Niko Kovac due to a poor start to the season – and also replaced him with interim boss Hans-Dieter Flick.</p>
      <p>The German giants are currently at third place in the Bundesliga standings with 24 points from 12 matches – one point behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
