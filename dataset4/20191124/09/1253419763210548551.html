      <p>SuperData Arcade has shared its monthly report, stating that COD:MW had the best selling digital launch of 2019. Furthermore, APEX Legends had its best month in October since the title’s launch quarter.</p>
      <p>Going into more details, Modern Warfare sold an estimated 4.75 million digital units across console and PC in October, down 11% from Black Ops 4 last year, although there were fewer days this year due to a later launch in the month. The average selling price of digital units also declined from last year due to the lack of a season pass bundle.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Apex Legends generated $45 million from in-game spending in October, up from $16 million in September. Respawn’s shooter has clearly grown into an important growth driver for EA since its launch in February. Still, <a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/">Superdata</a> notes that total lifetime revenue comes in slightly below 50% of FIFA Ultimate Team over that same period.</p>
      <p>In other news, NBA 2K continues to show a slow-down in virtual currency sales. Total franchise NBA in-game spending growth has been slowing down for the past four months.</p>
      <p>Moreover, consumers spent $8.84 billion digitally across all games in October. Combined spending across console, PC and mobile was down 3% year-over-year.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, here are top selling games for PC and consoles in October 2019.</p>
