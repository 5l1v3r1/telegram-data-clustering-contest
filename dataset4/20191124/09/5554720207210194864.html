      <p>India on Sunday created a world record after they beat Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs in the first-ever pink-ball Test played in India. This was their fourth consecutive Test victory by an innings margin, a first by any international team.</p>

      <p>Earlier, India had beaten South Africa by an innings and 137 runs in Pune, before repeating the feat in Ranchi when they defeated the Proteas by an innings and 202 runs this year. In the current series, India beat Bangladesh by an <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/india-beat-bangladesh-by-innings-and-130-runs-in-indore-test/272747/">innings and 130 runs</a> in Indore in the first Test match last week.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli achieved the feat after his side reduced Bangladesh to 195-9 runs in the second innings as the Tigers were bowled out for just 106 runs in their first innings. India had declared their innings at 347-9 with Kohli scoring a remarkable century. This was his <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/virat-kohli-equals-ricky-pontings-record-after-he-becomes-first-indian-to-score-century-in-pink-ball-test/273522/">41st international century</a> as a captain, equalling the previous record of former Australian captain Ricky Ponting.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma finished the match with nine wickets, while Umesh Yadav claimed a five-wicket haul in the second innings.</p>
      <p>Reacting to his side’s victory, Kohli said, “Amazing, the numbers have only gotten better. We didn’t think so many people will turn up today as we know the game will end earlier. This crowd sets the right kind of example. To reiterate the point of Test centres, this is a great example. It’s similar to when we play in other countries: it’s about the belief. The way these guys are bowling they can pick wickets anywhere.</p>
      <p>“Even the spinners, it’s about believing they can pick wickets overseas. We’re in the right frame of mind to capitalise on the opportunities and we’re enjoying it. The idea is to establish yourself in the middle. Test cricket is a mental battle. We’ve learnt to stand up – it all started from Dada’s team. The belief is key and to be honest we’ve worked hard, and reaping the rewards of it. I was thinking if they want to announce me as the Man of the Match, it has to go to either Umesh or Ishant. Nine wickets in a Test in India!”</p>
      <p>Most number of victories by over an innings in Test matches have been achieved by Graeme Smith, who led South Africa to achieve this feat in 22 games. Smith is followed by Australia’s legendary Steve Waugh, who captained his team to secure more than an innings win in 14 matches. Kohli has tied with New Zealand’s Stephen Fleming and England’s Andrew Strauss with 11 victories by an innings margin.</p>

      <p>His Bangladeshi counterpart Mahmudullah said, “Definitely, the gap between the two teams is concerning. We’ve to learn from these two matches and follow up what happened. The pink ball new balls are challenging and we couldn’t take the challenge with the new ball. If we lose no problem, but there was some positives. Ebadot bowled well. Riyadi and Mushfiqur batted well. When we saw the wickets, when we bat second same thing can happen. Batting second might not have made a big difference.”</p>
