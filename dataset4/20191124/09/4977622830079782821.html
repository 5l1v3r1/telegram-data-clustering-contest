      <h1>India And United States To Sign Industrial Security Annex (ISA) In The Second 2+2 Dialogue </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:52:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:52</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>In a major boost for the bolstering ties between India and the United States (US), the two nations are set to hold the second 2+2 format dialogue on 18 December in Washington, where the two nations are likely to sign the powerful Industrial Security Annex (ISA), <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-us-to-sign-industrial-security-agreement-at-22-dialogue/article30063585.ece">reports </a><i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>The ISA is a part of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) and its signing will pave the way for defence majors from the US to partner with Indian private sector companies for big-ticket defence deals for the Indian Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>The 2+2 meeting will also be taking a review of the progress made on operationalising the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) which India has already signed with the US.</p>
      <p>The COMCASA once operationalised will enable the ability between Armed Forces from the two nations to carry out encrypted communications and information sharing. It should be noted that India has already formed an account with as much as $5 million to pay for services or information it seeks from the US under COMCASA post its operationalisation.</p>
      <p>However, the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-spatial Cooperation (BECA), which is under discussion, is unlikely to be concluded.</p>
