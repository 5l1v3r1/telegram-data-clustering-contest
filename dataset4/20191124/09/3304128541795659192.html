      <p>World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge has been crowned Male World Athlete of the Year for the second year in a row at the annual World Athletics Gala held on Saturday in Monaco, France.</p>
      <p>Kipchoge beat other four finalists to the award including World 10,000m champion Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda and world 400m hurdles champion Karsten Warholm of Norway.</p>
      <p>Others were World 200m champion Noah Lyles and World Paul Vault champion Sam Kendricks both of USA.</p>
      <p>The award comes on the back of another eventful year for Kipchoge who retained his London Marathon title as he bagged his fourth title at the English capital.</p>
      <p>The Olympic champion also wrote history becoming the first man to cover a marathon race in less than two hours- a feat he achieved at the INEOS challenge held October in Vienna, Austria where he ran 1:59:40.</p>
