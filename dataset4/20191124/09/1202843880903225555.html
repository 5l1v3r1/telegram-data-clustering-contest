      <p>One loyal Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) customer was awarded QR1,000,000 (One Million Qatari Riyals). The annual grand prize is given to a lucky QIB MISK account holder as a reward for their savings habit. The Grand Prize Draw of the second year of MISK was conducted in the presence of official representatives from the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry and QIB representatives.</p>
      <p>Hanady Mohammed Al Mohannadi is the second grand prize winner of QR1m from QIB. She received her grand prize at the QIB Head Office on Grand Hamad Street, in the presence of  D. Anand, General Manager – Personal Banking Group, and other QIB senior management team members. The MISK Account is an innovative savings account that aims to encourage savings by building and rewarding positive financial habits. For the last 12 months, every month, two winners were awarded QR50,000 and every week, five winners were awarded QR10,000.</p>
      <p>Starting this November and for the next 52 weeks, the number of weekly winners to be rewarded QR10,000 each is increasing to ten. In addition, every month, two lucky winners will win QR50,000, each, for a span of 12 months. The grand prize draw for QR1,000,000 will take place in November 2020. The total number of winners in this new version will be 545 winners and total prizes will reach QR7.4m.</p>
      <p>Commenting on her grand prize win, Hanady Al Mohannady, said: “What a dream come true! I opened a MISK Savings Account with QIB to help support my long-term goals and continue to grow my savings, which has proven to be a success.’’</p>
      <p>Remarking on the success of the MISK Account, D. Anand, QIB’s Personal Banking Group General Manager, said: “We are delighted to congratulate Mrs. Hanady Al Mohannady for winning the grand prize of One Million Riyals with QIB. The MISK Account is a testament of our commitment to provide customers with relevant financial solutions. At QIB, it is important for us to reward our customers for developing positive financial habits, and therefore we look forward to rewarding many more of our loyal customers with valuable prizes.”</p>
      <p>He added: “We’re also pleased to announce the launch of the third round of the MISK Savings Account, to keep encouraging our customers to save more. This year, we are doubling the number of weekly winners we’re awarding, giving our customers a bigger chance to win. One lucky winner will again win the grand prize of one Million Riyals next year.”</p>
