      <h1>Netanyahu rival Sa'ar makes official request to hold Likud leadership race</h1>

      <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rival and Likud MK Gideon Sa'ar made an official request on Sunday, demanding the ruling party holds snap leadership primaries in a bid to unseat Israel's leader in case the country holds an unprecedented third elections in 12 months.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu on Thursday suffered a heavy blow to his hopes to remain in office after Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced his decision <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5629718,00.html">to indict the prime minister</a> for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in the three corruption investigations into the veteran politician who has led the country for more than a decade.</p>

      <p>"Calling it an 'attempted coup' is irresponsible and tramples upon the state systems," said Sa'ar, referring to <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5629804,00.html">Netanyahu's remarks made in a fiery speech</a> shortly after the charges had been announced.</p>
      <p>"Netanyahu won't be able to form a government. We need to go to snap elections in the next 21 days," he said.</p>
      <p>"We (Likud) are a democratic party, we are not Yesh Atid (one of Blue and White constituent parties) that cancels internal elections. Likud haven't had primaries for many years now. I will be able to form a government and unite the country."</p>
      <p>The prime minister's legal woes amplified voices within the party calling to unseat Netanyahu after over a decade at the party's helm, although most still side with the indicted leader.</p>

      <p>"Sa'ar's request is wrong and comes at a bad time," said Likud MK and Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, adding that if the internal elections were to be held, he would vote for Netanyahu.</p>
      <p>Likud Central Committee Chairman MK Haim Katz said on Saturday that Likud MKs who want to challenge Netanyahu for the party's leadership should be able to do so, giving a green light to the premiership poll.</p>
      <p>After Netanyahu and Blue and White party leader MK Benny Gantz both failed to form a government after the Sep. 17 elections, President Reuven Rivlin announced on Thursday the beginning of a 21-day period where 61 MKs could recommend any member to begin forming a government before the next elections are called.</p>
