        <b>SHEYI OJO fired Rangers on the road to the Europa League last 32 with the only goal against Feyenoord back in September.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now the on-loan Liverpool ace wants to complete the journey by getting the better of the Dutch side on Thursday and booking a place in the next round.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Steven Gerrard’s side</a> travel to the Netherlands knowing that if they avoid defeat, it would put them in pole position to qualify from Group G.</p>
      <p>Since the Ibrox victory Jaap Stam has been replaced in the Feyenoord dugout by former Rangers boss Dick Advocaat as the Little General tries to revive the Dutch giants’ fortunes.</p>
      <p>Ojo believes his stunner in the 1-0 win two months ago was the most vital moment of his Gers career so far and he insists the squad believe they can get the job done.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think it was important for everyone because it was the first game in the group.</p>

      <p>“That was one of the best team performances we have had and we are looking to emulate that on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We’ll look to be as aggressive as we can with and without the ball. We did that in the home game and that’s why we dominated so much.</p>
      <p>“Feyenoord are a top team with top players, so we are going to have to match that and probably play even better to get a good result.</p>
      <p>“So far we have done really well and if we win or get a good result against Feyenoord, we should be through.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is looking forward to it. The European run has been really good — it’s been a good experience for me and everyone is enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“The fact that there are so many games coming thick and fast keeps it exciting and everyone wants to progress to the next stage. Hopefully we can do that.</p>
      <p>“I think overall this season we have only lost two games. We are really confident going into this game and we back ourselves against any of the top teams.</p>
      <p>“If we play our football like we know we can, we should be able to get a good result.”</p>

      <p>Before the European adventure continues, Gerrard’s men have to take care of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14917/hamilton/">Hamilton Accies</a> first.</p>
      <p>Ojo knows Brian Rice’s men will throw up a different challenge than the Eredivisie side will on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The wide man admits it can be difficult when some teams play with so many men behind the ball to try and stop the Light Blues.</p>
      <p>However, he insists he doesn’t have a problem with it and says the Rangers players just have to make sure they take their chances when they come along.</p>
      <p>He added: “Playing in the Europa League is a lot more tactical. It’s back and forth and in the Scottish league it’s predominantly us who have the ball so we need to try to break teams down.</p>
      <p>“I have to adapt my game depending on the style of game. You just try to affect the game as much as you can.</p>
      <p>“We have been working on that in training, how to beat low blocks. The manager is always telling me to try and affect the space in behind.</p>
      <p>“I try do that as much as I can but there isn’t always a lot of space as a lot of the Scottish teams sit back.</p>
      <p>"But I genuinely like to get on the ball too so it doesn’t bother me too much.</p>
      <p>“As an attacking player you need to be even more clinical with your chances, or your movement in behind and to feet.</p>
      <p>“It is definitely a challenge but whichever league you play in you have got to get the ball and try to affect the game and make things happen.”</p>
