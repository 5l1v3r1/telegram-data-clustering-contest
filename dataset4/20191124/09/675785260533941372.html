      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should feel the heat at Man Utd as perfect replacement emerges</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino would be walking into a bigger job if he took over at either Manchester United or Real Madrid, and the appointment could come sooner rather than later</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:26:20+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Fowler, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-fowler/</a></address>
      <p>If you want a true indication of how barmy football can be, Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked – and could go into a bigger role than the job he’s just lost.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t a mutual agreement, they just got rid of him. Yet I wouldn’t be surprised to see him at Manchester United or Real Madrid in the next few weeks or months, both bigger clubs.</p>
      <p>And that tells you the job he has done, despite the lost direction. I know Pochettino hasn’t won anything – and that is always important – but I still believe he’s been a victim of his own success.</p>
      <p>He’s set a standard there, where Spurs have almost been able to bank on a top-four finish, Champions League and the money that brings.</p>
      <p>They’ve also been able to bank on quality recruitment and a steady conveyor belt of youth without breaking the bank.</p>

      <p>They were in the Champions League final five months ago with that policy – and so you can see why United or Real would be interested.</p>
      <p>In some ways, he’s like Jurgen Klopp, in that he can get creative to produce competitive teams without having to spend huge amounts.</p>
      <p>I can see the fact that Pochettino is now a free agent putting intense pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>Ole’s press conference before the weekend was about a potential replacement, not United’s visit to Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>And, actually, the focus should be on that because it’s a horribly difficult fixture and the sort that inspires questions from fans if it’s lost.</p>
      <p>I love what Chris Wilder is doing at Sheffield United and he’s got an honest team – who proved against Liverpool they can give the best sides a real test.</p>

      <p>Yet United are still expected to win and, if they don’t, the Pochettino question will be inevitable.</p>
      <p>It’s tough on Solskjaer and ideally he’ll have a decent winning run now so he doesn’t have to face that awful pressure.</p>
      <p>But it is a barmy world, is football.</p>
