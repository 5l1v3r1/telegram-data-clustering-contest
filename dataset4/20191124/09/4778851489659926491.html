        <b>Rangers starlet snubs deal</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rangers could lose Leon King in the same manner as Billy Gilmour after the highly-rated centre-back turned down the offer of a professional contract. The Scotland under-17s international doesn't turn 16 until January and can choose to sign elsewhere. Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, along with German side RB Leipzig, are all chasing his signature. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/leon-king-rangers-contract-snub-20945997"><b>(Daily Record)</b></a></p>

        <b>Lennon: Kennedy could replace me</b>
      </p>
      <p>It might not seem like the greatest career move for any manager to declare that his No.2, without ever having held a frontline coaching position, possesses the capabilities to do his job. The fact Neil Lennon is willing to make such a bold claim about John Kennedy both reflects how highly he rates him, and how comfortable he feels in the Celtic managerâ€™s post. <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic/john-kennedy-now-ready-to-move-into-management-and-could-replace-me-at-celtic-one-day-says-neil-lennon-1-5051347"><b>(The Scotsman)</b></a></p>

        <b>Hands off McGinn</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has warned circling clubs to forget about trying to poach Jack Grealish and John McGinn when the January transfer window opens. The ex-Hibs midfielder, once pursued by Celtic, was described as playing 'at Man United level' by former boss Steve Bruce. <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/hibernian/aston-villa-boss-delivers-hands-off-warning-over-man-united-level-john-mcginn-1-5051202"><b>(The Scotsman)</b></a></p>

        <b>Winning start for Jack</b>
