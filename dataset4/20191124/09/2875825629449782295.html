      <p>Erik Thorstvedt is a man who knows a thing or two about <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> turmoil.</p>
      <p>And, according to the big former Norway and Spurs keeper, bringing in Jose Mourinho for the sacked Mauricio Pochettino just shows how crazy the modern game has become.</p>
      <p>Thorstvedt, 57, was at the club for Terry Venables’ shock move upstairs to take on the role of chief executive, shortly after guiding Spurs to the FA Cup back in 1991.</p>
      <p>Looking at the axing of Pochettino, Thorstvedt said: “I didn’t think it was going to happen. If the sacking was only because of the results, it’s incredible really.</p>
      <p>“The down-turn hasn’t just been this season, it goes a little bit further back. But I think he would have been able to turn it around. He will a massive name for Tottenham fans forever.</p>

      <p>“It amazes me how quickly things can turn and this is a prime example.</p>
      <p>“A Champions League final – and now this. We’re going to remember his time as the happy days.</p>
      <p>“There has been stability, consistent top-four finishes, the ground, the training ground – the joy that has been there for the fans has been incredible.</p>
      <p>“Now a manager that Tottenham fans have been trained to hate is in charge. And we’re going to start hearing Mourinho songs coming from the stands. It’s so strange.</p>
      <p>“It will be fascinating to see how it plays out. I don’t know if it’s going to end well, because it rarely does with Mourinho.</p>
      <p>“But maybe there’s a trophy in the cabinet before that all happens.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, it’s now almost 12 seasons since a trophy, and with Spurs having already blown their League Cup and Premier League hopes this season, Thorstvedt added: “The best chance would have to be the FA Cup – that’s what Mourinho must target.”</p>
