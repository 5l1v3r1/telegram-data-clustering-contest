      <p>Police have arrested a man in Birmingham after a Jewish family was racially abused on the London Underground.</p>
      <p>The suspect, whose name and age have not been released by police, was detained on Saturday night after a video filmed on Friday showed a man reading anti-Jewish bible passages to a couple and their three children while they were travelling on the Northern Line.</p>
      <p>The footage showed the dad trying to distract his son by talking to him while the man was ranting at them.</p>
      <p>A witness also said the man had blamed Jews for enslaving blacks and said they were responsible for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/9-11/">9/11</a> terror attacks.</p>

      <p>She said she saw what was happening and knew she had to confront him.</p>
      <p>Mrs Shuweikh said: ‘I would have loved more people to come up and say something because if everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did.</p>
      <p>‘Being a mother-of-two, I know what it’s like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation.’</p>

      <p>Fellow commuter Chris Atkins took the video after catching the Tube heading south on the Charing Cross branch of the line at midday on Friday.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The Muslim woman didn’t take any s**t from him and really, really took him to task, very firmly and persistently.’</p>
      <p>‘In this day and age we are told how intolerant everyone is and all religions hate each other and there you had a Muslim woman sticking up for some Jewish children.’</p>
      <p>Mr Atkins said he had later swapped seats with the boy who was being racially abused in order to protect him.</p>
      <p>The suspect was held on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence and he remains in custody.</p>
