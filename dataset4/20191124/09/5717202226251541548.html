      <h1>Sunderland fans praise Duncan Watmore’s substitute cameo against Coventry</h1>
      <h2>Duncan Watmore was injured at the start of the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:45:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland fans have praised Duncan Watmore for his performance against Coventry City.</p>
      <p>Coventry and Sunderland shared the points at The Stadium of Light with Benji Kimpioka’s late goal cancelling out Dom Hyam’s header. But Sunderland fans pointed to the introduction of Watmore as the turning point.</p>
      <p>Sunderland were struggling to create anything against a well-drilled Coventry side, who started the game in third place. Hyam’s opener was not enough to spark Sunderland into life but Watmore made a difference.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old came on in the 65th minute, replacing Max Power. Immediately, Sunderland had a bit more pace, energy and urgency moving forward. He seemed to lift the players around him and get Sunderland further up the pitch.</p>
      <p>Kimpioka also came off the bench and he made the telling intervention, slotting home after Coventry failed to clear the ball. But Watmore was praised in equal measure for his role in Sunderland coming from behind to rescue a late point.</p>
      <p>Here are some tweets from Sunderland fans talking about Watmore’s 25-minute cameo against the Sky Blues.</p>
