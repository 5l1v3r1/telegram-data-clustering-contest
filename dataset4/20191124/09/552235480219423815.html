      <h2>The French side have been poor this season and are looking to turn things around in Glasgow.</h2>

      <p>Rennes boss Julien Stephan has revealed he's ashamed of his side ahead of their Europa League trip to Celtic this week.</p>
      <p>The Hoops have already safely made it through to the knockout stages with two games to spare after famous home and away successes over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> .</p>
      <p>But manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> will demand his side maintain their position at the top of the group when French strugglers <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rennes">Rennes</a> , who are already out, visit Glasgow this week.</p>
      <p>Their weekend 2-1 defeat to Dijon saw them plunge into the bottom half of Ligue 1 and manager Stephan has had enough of some of his players.</p>

      <p>He said: "We were very weak in every department. The feeling I have at the moment is one of shame for our position in the league.</p>
      <p>"We have fans who come and support us and we repay them with a performance like that.</p>
      <p>"It's a big disappointment. Me, the players and the staff should be ashamed of that. It's a long way from being good enough.</p>
      <p>"There was a lack of commitment among some of the players and that can never be acceptable.</p>
      <p>"Now we have a big challenge in Scotland in midweek and I will look to see if these players can respond to this defeat."</p>
