      <h1>Sheffield United vs Manchester United: Best bets for Sunday's Premier League and Championship games</h1>
      <h2>Expert betting tips for Bramall Lane clash PLUS Hull at Boro and Newcastle's trip to Aston Villa on Monday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Hankin</a></address>
      <p>Cheap as chips Marcus Rashford can rule today’s clash of financial cultures.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder knows all about thriving on a shoestring. Jose Mourinho should probably be taking notes.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United (4.30pm) are one of only FIVE current Prem clubs to have spent even less on transfers over the last five seasons than Jose’s new gig <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>His old gig <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ’s net spend was 11 times that of the Blades over the period – never mind the wages.</p>
      <p>One of Jose’s bright ideas at Old Trafford, Alexis Sanchez, is apparently still on £35-an-hour of United’s coin over in Milan.</p>
      <p>That’s 24/7. Whether he’s enjoying the celebrated Renaissance art and fine dining, relaxing with a sudoku beside the infinity pool, trying his hand at the local football, or savouring his full eight hours of dreamless slumber.</p>
      <p>Rashford has been on United’s books since he was seven, after impressing Fergie with his vision and quick feet playing second shepherd in the Button Lane Primary School nativity.</p>
      <p>He cost nowt. He’s scored in eight of his last 10. <b>He’s ‘anytime scorer’ gold - get on Marcus Rashford at 15/8 (Fred).</b></p>
      <p>In the Championship, Jarrod Bowen can be the bright spark for punters amid the Riverside gloom.</p>
      <p><b>Middlesbrough</b> are in terrible shape for the visit of <b>Hull (12pm)</b> , but persevere with bright, ambitious Jonathan Woodgate as he guides Boro down the plughole. Mind you, it did Gareth Southgate no harm.</p>
      <p>Boro have scored six in their last 10 games. Hull’s Bowen can match that total just on his own.</p>
      <p>It’s a grim game to punt, but the <b>21/10 (888sport, Unibet) ‘Jarrod Bowen anytime scorer’</b> is plump.</p>
      <p>Back in the Premier League, the weaknesses in the Aston Villa defence look a perfect fit for big Andy Carroll <b>(tomorrow, 8pm).</b></p>
      <p>You’ll have immediately spotted the flaw in this exciting theory.</p>
      <p>I’ve totted up the total minutes of Biffa’s visits to the football pitch with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> since he arrived in August. All told, I make it about two and a bit episodes of Pointless.</p>
      <p><b>Ciaran Clark</b> can be a similar set-piece threat, and at <b>16/1 (Bet365) ‘anytime’</b> is a worthy shout.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Last time: Winner at 7/4</b>
