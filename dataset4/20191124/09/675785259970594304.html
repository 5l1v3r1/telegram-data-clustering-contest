      <p>The injured officers all sustained minor facial injuries.</p>
      <p>Supt Ian Green, from Birmingham Police, said: “This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night out at the cinema understandably frightened.</p>
      <p>“We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order. </p>
      <p>“Thankfully, the injuries to our officers were very minor. We’ve also recovered two machetes and a knife, and it’s clear that some of those who went to Star City last night were intent on causing trouble.</p>

      <p>“We’ve had a great response from the public who have been very supportive of our officers.</p>
      <p>"We understand that families with young children will have been left upset by what they saw last night, but we urge people to appreciate that our aim last night was to protect the public and restore order, and that’s what we achieved.</p>
      <p>“We’re aware of a number of images and videos circulating on social media which appear to show those involved in last night’s violence.</p>
      <p>“We are assessing those and have already had a number of phone calls from members of the public giving us the names of people they believe were involved last night.</p>
      <p>“I’d ask anyone with images or video who has not yet got in touch already to do so that we can make further arrests.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
