      <h1>I’m not stealing the limelight – my son and I are quite the handsome pair</h1>

        <i>It’s time for a new photo and this time around my baby looks just as gorgeous as me</i>
      </p>
      <p>The lights have been set up and my son is ready for his close-up. He’s primed and preened in a nice jumper, hair brushed in that one way that means he’s either going to mass or having a photoshoot. Actually, in a strange reversal of my own childhood, he has now attended twice as many photoshoots as church services – so perhaps we’re gearing him up to rebel via a dramatic lean toward Catholic devotion in his mid-teens. At least my dad will be happy.</p>
      <p>For now though, it’s time to update the photo for the print versions of this column, which means my wife and I spend an afternoon cajoling him into being as toothsome as he can be. Getting it right is important – because his previous photo was a bone of contention in our marriage.</p>
      <p>For one thing, he hasn’t looked much like a newborn for a very long time, and it seems strange for my tales of a 16-month old to be accompanied by a photo of me holding a child so young his fingerprints haven’t yet hardened – not least one who, looking back, is a dead ringer for Phil Mitchell struggling through any flavour of pot noodle except chicken and mushroom. Which brings me to the other main gripe my wife has about that picture.</p>

      <p>She’s long maintained I chose it because I, and I alone, looked moderately handsome in it, even though it made my son look like an alien that’s just received an unexpectedly large gas bill. This is a charge I can’t really defend myself against. Primarily because I have admitted many times in person, and at least once in this very column, that this is precisely what happened.</p>
      <p>My defence is twofold: First, since I am the one who actually writes these articles, I should be allowed to use my beauty to promote their contents (and vice versa). Second, if someone takes 400 pictures of me then, yes, I am going to pick the most handsome one, whether my son looks like a half-digested turnip in it or not.</p>
      <aside>I am going to pick the most handsome picture, even if my son looks like a half-digested turnip</aside>
      <p>Frankly, I’m surprised this is even a discussion. I need the help; he doesn’t. Babies are an aesthetic free hit. I, on the other hand, have about four angles that work for me, roughly once a fortnight, and usually while catching my impeccable male model-like reflection during night-time tube trips. Sidebar: I have never worked out if I do actually look super great in the darkened echo of night tube windows, or if the fact I’m on the tube at night means I’m sufficiently pissed to regard myself with a smirking, ‘Hmmm you still got it.’</p>
      <p>In the end, my son did everything he could to replicate his first shoot, spending an hour plaintively wailing as if each snap of the flashbulb was a precursor to the entrance of a firing squad. But, it all came good with the shot you see before you – me sporting a sassy little kink in my hip, he with the folded hands of a gentle little cartoon church mouse. Perhaps there’s room in the family for two models after all.</p>
