      <h2>Albion may not have been at their best but they dug deep to beat Sheffield Wednesday – with Charlie Austin's late penalty keeping them top of the Championship.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:57:15+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>Here we rate the players.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SAM JOHNSTONE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another steady showing from the glovesman who coped well with everything Sheffield Wednesday threw at him. Johnstone made a number of routine saves and commanded his area well. He did make one magnificent stop to deny Steven Fletcher – but the striker was offside. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>DARNELL FURLONG</b>
      </p>
      <p>A disciplined display from the full-back who curbed his attacking instincts to ensure there were no pockets of space for the visitors to exploit. Furlong largely shackled the threat of the lively Kadeem Harris. He also sent in one excellent cross for Hal Robson-Kanu. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>AHMED HEGAZI</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's been a long road back for the defender since his ankle surgery and it showed here with Hegazi very rusty. He miss-read the flight of the ball in the first few minutes allowing Jacob Murphy to get in behind. And after the interval, he inexplicably lost possession in his own box - which should have led to Fletcher to scoring. He'll get there but Hegazi is going to need a few more games until he is back to his commanding best. <b>5</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>KYLE BARTLEY</b>
      </p>
      <p>What a season the centre-back is having. Wearing the captain's armband, Bartley made an outstanding, goal-saving, block to deny Julian Borner early on. And he continued to shine from there with the defender dominant in the air, strong in the tackle and always willing to put his body on the line. Magnificent. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>CONOR TOWNSEND</b>
      </p>
      <p>The left-back has had a good few weeks since Nathan Ferguson's red card and deserved to keep his place ahead of the fit-again Kieran Gibbs. But at times he was nervy in possession here. You can also argue he should have cleared his lines instead of passing to Filip Krovinvoic in the build-up to Sheffield Wednesday's penalty. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>SEMI AJAYI</b>
      </p>
      <p>Moved into midfield with Jake Livermore suspended, Ajayi cut a commanding figure in the middle of the park. Playing as an anchor, he wasn't as box-to-box as his suspended team mate. But against a very direct Sheffield Wednesday side, he provided excellent protection for the back four. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>FILIP KROVINOVIC</b>
      </p>
      <p>A tough performance to rate. Filling in for Romaine Sawyers, Krovinovic made Albion tick in the first-half with his passing crisp and purposeful. But he got it all wrong for the penalty, with the Croatian turning into danger, losing the ball and then hacking Kieran Lee to the floor. <b>5</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>MATT PHILLIPS</b>
      </p>
      <p>A frustrating afternoon for Phillips who worked hard but struggled to influence the game in an attacking sense. Phillips' touch seemed to desert him just when it mattered. His crossing and set-piece delivery also weren't at there pin-point best. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>MATHEUS PEREIRA</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you play in the number 10 role, you always have to make a telling contribution. And Pereira does week in, week out. His through-ball for Robson-Kanu's goal was beautiful. The Brazilian then showed nous, hunger and desire to win the late penalty. What a player. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>GRADY DIANGANA</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rough treatment Pereira gets is often talked about, but Diangana is equally kicked from pillar to post. The 21-year-old handles it so well though and did again here. A threat with his trickery throughout, Diangana sent in a wonderful cross from which Austin hit the post. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>HAL ROBSON-KANU</b>
      </p>
      <p>As beautiful as Pereira's pass was, Robson-Kanu still had a lot to do as he charged through on goal. But he carried the ball into the box before showing great confidence to roll it past Kieren Westwood. Also impressed with his hold-up play in another excellent showing. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>SUBS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>CHARLIE AUSTIN</b> (for Robson-Kanu 75) Hit the post and showed great character to score from the spot. You couldn’t ask any more from a 15-minute cameo. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>GARETH BARRY</b> (for Hegazi 75)</p>
      <p>Hasn’t played since March but you honestly could not tell. Barry impressed with his passing and got about the pitch well. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>CHRIS BRUNT </b>(for Krovinovic 80)</p>
      <p>Like Barry, Brunt came on impressed with his intelligent use of the ball. <b>N/A</b></p>
      <p>Not used: Bond, Gibbs, Edwards, Zohore.</p>
