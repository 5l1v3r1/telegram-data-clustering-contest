          </p>
          <p>Every match where we have had to sit down and document Jozi Stars’ campaign in the ongoing edition of the Mzansi Super League has only lead us towards one narrative. It’s been a torrid one with the side’s travesty being easy to document given the way the side have been broken down and decimated to find themselves right in the trenches of the points tally.</p>
          <p>Sitting in sixth place with five defeats from five matches, for Jozi Stars, this edition of the showpiece league is turning out to be one to forget. What has made for a particularly dismal sight is not just the defeats but the horrid manner in which they have come about for the side with the team being comprehensively and clinically thwarted in all segments of the game to all but bring an end to their season this edition.</p>

                <p>The side come into this encounter in the wake of a 4 wicket defeat at the hands of Paarl Rocks, a match which saw their 130 run target being peeled off with almost four wickets to spare. Up against such a dwindling outfit, Tshwane Spartans will be looking to register a much needed win with the side having had to bear the brunt of inclement weather, one which has seen three of their encounters being truncated due to incessant rainfall.</p>
                <p>It was a discourse which was emanated the last time around as well with the side seeing what looked to be a certain win being snatched away from them. Making 141 while batting first, the side had Durban Heat on the mat at 21-3 before rain decided to leave them infuriated. </p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>There are seldom few tracks better than this one in the country for the batsmen with this surface being a runs galore one. The batting unit is going to love its time out in the middle and with their being a slight chance of rain marring the match, the side winning the toss is bound to come out and chase here.</p>

                            <h3>JOZ Vs TST Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 23 runs in the side’s last outing, Heinrich Klaasen from Tshwane Spartans is being inducted into our Dream 11 outfit for this encounter. The player is someone capable of coming out and opening his arms ith ease to amass a bagful of runs, a dependable bat who can always maximise in any kind of prevelant conditions. </p>
                            <h3>JOZ Vs TST Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Part of a stellar 81 run opening partnership for their side in the unit’s last outing, Dean Elgar and Theunis de Bruyn were in exquisite touch for their outfit. The two set a statement as they laid down the ideal platform for their counterparts to come out and build on from with Bruyn getting 40 runs in that partnership whilst Dean Elgar remained unbeaten on 57 to make them both instant picks for us. AB de Villiers might not have managed to really get going till now but he’s someone we just can’t afford to leave out to see him complete the trivalent of picks from the unit.</p>
                            <p>His side’s top scorer in a season of peril, Reeza Hendricks has shed a beacon of light on an otherwise howler of a journey for the side. If it wasn’t for the opener, the side would have failed to muster up even the bare minimum in their encounters with the bat marauding his way to 40 runs the last time around as well to stamp hs credentials.</p>
                            <p>The 30 runs for Rassie van der Dussen the last time around see him be inducted from the setup as well alongside Temba Bavuma to wrap up proceedings in this docket of our Dream 11 unit. </p>
                            <h3>JOZ Vs TST Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>After picking up 23 runs with the bat in the side’s previous affair, we are moving in with Daniel Christian for today’s encounter. The all-rounder is someone who will play an instrumental role for his side today given his ability to incorporate his traits in both the facets of the game and come up with pivotal displays on a persistent basis.</p>
                            <h3>JOZ Vs TST Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His side’s leading wicket taker in the previous encounter, Duanne Olivier left batsmen flummoxed and beleaguered as he persistently cramped them for room with both inswing and outing. Kagiso Rabada returned with the two wickets alongside him to see us pick up the deadly duo from Jozi Stars whilst from the other side of the docket we are venturing in with Lutho Sipamla.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Elgar or side’s captain for the day while Reeza is the vice-captain.</p>
