      <p>An 81-year-old law graduate of the Lead City University, Ibadan, Lt Col Layiwola Adegunju (retd), has commended the management of the institution for granting him the scholarship to complete his law degree, which he did recently.</p>
      <p>In a chat with our correspondent, Adegunju said, “The management of the institution, including the Chancellor, Prof Babatunde Ogunmola; Prof Jide Owoeye and Emeritus Prof Bamidele Aladekomo, made it possible.</p>
      <p>He said, “The reason is that they made Eduserve Consult, which has recorded remarkable achievements in promoting educational development at both the tertiary and non-tertiary levels especially in Ibadan, and supporting the needy in search of quality university education.”</p>
