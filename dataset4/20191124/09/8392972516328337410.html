      <h1>Strictly Come Dancing viewers blast Craig Revel Horwood over 'ridiculous' scores</h1>
      <h2>Fans were "screaming" at their screens!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:46:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Brown</a></address>
      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> have slammed judge Craig Revel Horwood for his "ridiculous" scores.</p>
      <p>Craig has never been the easiest judge to please, but last night he angered viewers as he took things to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>The judge awarded Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard a five for their samba – much to fellow judge Motsi Mabusi's shock.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And, after Alex Scott and Neil Jones's Argentine tango – which saw the pair stuck together in an epic wardrobe malfunction – Craig struck again.</p>
      <aside>No way Alex and Neil deserved to be at bottom of leader board tonight. Craig sort ya scoring out darrrrlinnngggg.</aside>
      <p>He gave the couple – who danced the first Argentine tango of the 2019 series – a four.</p>
