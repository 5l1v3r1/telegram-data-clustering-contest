      <p>First-half goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcus-tavernier/"><b>Marcus Tavernier</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ashley-fletcher/"><b>Ashley Fletcher</b></a> put Boro on course to avoid stretching a winless run to 10 matches outside the top-flight for the first time since 1985.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marvin-johnson/"><b>Marvin Johnson</b></a> was sent off with seven minutes remaining of the first half when he left his studs needlessly high on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-lichaj/"><b>Eric Lichaj</b></a> when he slid in to make a block.</p>
      <p>And that proved costly as Hull fought back after the restart, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jarrod-bowen/"><b>Jarrod Bowen</b></a> scoring two goals inside four minutes to take a point.</p>
      <p>Middlesbrough opened the scoring after seven minutes. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paddy-mcnair/"><b>Paddy McNair</b></a>'s run and low cross after Fletcher and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/britt-assombalonga/"><b>Britt Assombalonga</b></a> had combined resulted in Tavernier being in the right place to control and finish to open the scoring.</p>
      <p>The second in the 28th minute was even better. Johnson's little side-step past his marker in his own half was followed by a delightful pass into the final third to get Boro moving.</p>
      <p>Assombalonga's dummy allowed the ball to run for Fletcher, who then played a perfect one-two with his strike partner before rounding goalkeeper George Long and coolly slotting into the empty net.</p>
      <p>That goal had the Riverside purring and Middlesbrough played with so much confidence after that to belie their lowly league position.</p>
      <p>But referee Jeremy Simpson's decision to dismiss Johnson meant the task of staying ahead was made much more difficult.</p>
      <p>Hull, whose defence had been opened up time and again, stepped things up and in the closing stages of the first half there were a few signs that Darren Randolph in the home goal would be busier.</p>
      <p>That was how it turned out as the Tigers sensed they could claw themselves back from the brink of defeat.</p>
      <p>Bowen burst into life. His first goal in the 71st minute was drilled low and hard from 25 yards into Randolph's bottom-right corner, and then hit his seventh in six matches just four minutes later.</p>
      <p>Bowen's initial header was blocked by Dael Fry but the forward made no mistake from the rebound when he drilled low inside Randolph's near post.</p>
