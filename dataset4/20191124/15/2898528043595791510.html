      <h1>Mark Hunt explodes after judge dismisses remainder of lawsuit against the UFC, Dana White and Brock Lesnar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/139/mark-hunt">Mark Hunt</a>’s fight against the UFC is finished, and he didn’t come away with a win.</p>
      <p>A judge in the U.S. district court in Nevada ruled in favor of the UFC while dismissing the reminder of Hunt’s lawsuit against the promotion after he initially filed a claim against them in 2017.</p>
      <p>Most of the lawsuit had previously been dismissed back in February but the last remaining charge of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was tossed out this week.</p>
      <p>After the lawsuit was dismissed, Hunt exploded on social media as he ripped his former employers and the legal system for not siding with him on the case.</p>
      <p>“I tried to make things even on the battle field of MMA but again the cheating company, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>, UFC with all its billions they ripped everyone off win again,” Hunt wrote on Instagram. “Someone will die against a steroid using cheater and your sh*t rip off company will be at fault UFC.</p>
      <p>“I hope all you f*ckers burn, filthy dog c*nnnniesss u can go and get f*****aaaaaarrrkkkkeddd. You won this battle but the war will continue. I am not the first to sue this rip off company and sure as hell won’t be the last to sue the UFC. You can’t keep ripping fighters off and run monopoly on the market someone’s going to put u motherf*ckers down.”</p>

      <p>Hunt initially sued the promotion, UFC president Dana White and former heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/27/brock-lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> alleging racketeering, fraud, breach of contract and more; Hunt is seeking compensatory damages, declaratory relief, punitive damages, statutory treble damages and attorney’s fees.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit stemmed from Hunt’s loss to Lesnar at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/746/ufc-200">UFC 200</a> in 2016 when he fell by unanimous decision to the current WWE superstar. It was revealed after the fight that Lesnar had tested positive the anti-estrogen drug clomiphene in a drug test that was actually administered 11 days before the event took place.</p>
      <p>Lesnar had been granted an exemption under the UFC’s anti-doping policy that allowed him to compete without additional drug testing typically required for a fighter returning from retirement.</p>
      <p>Lesnar’s win was overturned to a no contest and he was suspended for one-year for the violation of the UFC’s anti-doping policy but Hunt sought further damages and believed the UFC should have turned over his entire $2.5 million purse as a result.</p>
      <p>He filed the lawsuit seeking damages against the UFC, White and Lesnar but this ruling officially dismisses whatever claims were remaining.</p>
      <p>Hunt continued fighting in the UFC even after the lawsuit was filed but his career with the company ended after he lost the final three fights on his contract. Hunt hasn’t competed since he fell to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3671/justin-willis">Justin Willis</a> in 2018.</p>
