      <p>COLLIER COUNTY, Fla. — An ex-Marco Island firefighter who was charged for sending pictures of his privates to a sixteen-year-old girl in May 2018 was arrested Friday for shoplifting items less than a $100, according to Collier County Sheriff's Office arrest report.</p>
      <p>Nick Macchiarolo was fired the day Collier County Sheriff’s Office charged him for sending pictures of his privates to a minor in May of 2018, but it was where the two were having sex, that raised more questions.</p>
      <p>Documents detailed how the firefighter and the teenager had sex at a gym located within the fire department. Police reports said Macchiarolo and the minor started speaking over social media in November 2017. By early January, the victim stated the messages become sexual, and Macchiarolo sent two photos of his genitals.</p>
      <p>Reports obtained through Collier County Sheriff’s Office said that Macchiarolo and the minor engaged in sexual acts within the fire department gym seven times. The report says the victim states: “she was observed as being there at least a couple of times by Marco Island police officers and other firefighters."</p>
      <p>According to the arrest report, Macchiarolo said he thought the minor was 21 years old at the time. Macchiarolo charged with Transmission of Harmful Material to a Minor and Using a Computer to Seduce a Child.</p>
      <p>The Marco Island Fire Chief said Macchiarolo was fired the day he was charged.</p>
      <p>The Fire Chief released a statement saying, “We don’t tolerate this, we brought in the Collier County Sheriff's Office to investigate the matter. we were very proactive with this matter, and we were very clear with {nick} that this would not be tolerated.”</p>
