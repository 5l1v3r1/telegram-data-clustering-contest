      <p>Kolkata - <b>Bangladesh</b> skipper <b>Mominul Haque</b> said Sunday that playing more Tests against top sides was the only way forward after they suffered a crushing loss to India in a day-night Test.</p>
      <p>The tourists went down by an innings and 46 runs in Kolkata to be whitewashed in the two-match series.</p>
      <p>The defeat comes after Bangladesh, led then by Shakib Al Hasan, lost a home Test to Afghanistan in September.</p>
      <p>Mominul feels things will improve next year, however, with Bangladesh scheduled to play around 10 Tests - including against Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that we don't play a lot of Tests... so I think we can overcome these issues," Mominul told reporters.</p>
      <p>He offered no explanation for the drubbing, saying: "There's no room for excuses. Losers give excuses. I am not giving it."</p>
      <p>Bangladesh are scheduled to play two Tests in Pakistan in January, but the tour is still in doubt due to security concerns.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh pulled off memorable wins against England and Australia in 2016 and 2017 but have won just 13 Tests since playing their first in 2000 against India in Dhaka.</p>
      <p>"I think we will improve. There are more sporting wickets in domestic matches and pace bowlers are coming up," said Mominul.</p>
      <p>"So I think we are on the right track."</p>
      <p>Bangladesh had a troubled build-up to a series after regular skipper Shakib was banned for two years, with one year suspended, for failing to report bookie approaches.</p>
      <p>The touring side also missed prolific opener Tamim Iqbal who took a break due to family reasons.</p>
      <p>"We have been missing them since the start of the series. But we shouldn't use it as an excuse," said Mominul.</p>
      <p>"Opportunities opened up for others. It was an opportunity for me as a captain. But we couldn't grab those opportunities."</p>
