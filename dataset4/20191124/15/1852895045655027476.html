      <h1>Porsha Williams Cozies With Fiancé Dennis &amp; Daughter Pilar After Slamming ‘The Real’ Cohost Loni Love</h1>

      <h4>Porsha Williams appeared to be in much better spirits hours after she slammed Loni Love for apparently mocking her relationship with fiancé Dennis McKinley.</h4>
      <p>Party of three please!<a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/celeb/porsha-stewart"><b> Porsha Williams</b></a>, 38, spent her Saturday, Nov. 23, at Dennis’ place of business The Original Hot Dog Factory in downtown Atlanta alongside their super cute daughter <b>Pilar Jhena</b>, 8 months. <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> star invited her fans to chow down on some delicious hot dogs when she posted an Instagram Story about a franchise event they were having that day. Porsha later shared videos of her scarfing down some of the items while there which she looked to enjoy quite a bit. Things took a turn for the adorable when she uploaded photos and clips of her daughter acting hilariously at her daddy’s store that made the doting couple giggle with delight!</p>
      <p>Porsha attempted to do a snap with her handsome man and precious daughter that eventually became a clip as Pilar wouldn’t sit still! Her little one bounced around while making hysterical faces with Porsha and Dennis smiling in the background. “The closer we get to a year the more lit she is!!” she joked in the caption. “This is why we can’t get a family pic @pilarjhena.” Fans warned her that it’s only going to get worse as she gets older. “Get ready because once they start walking it’s over,” beauty influencer <b>Ming Lee</b>, 33, wrote in the comments section.</p>
      <p>Oh no! Pilar’s mood appeared to have taken a turn for the sour when Porsha posted another set of pics of her not looking too pleased. “Whew Chile now PJ pouting y’all! What age is the craziest? I heard 2yr&amp; 4yr lol.” Once again, fans let the longtime reality star know what’s to come. “When she get two just run as fast as you can,” a follower joked.</p>

      <p>Porsha’s own mood was much worse hours earlier after she slammed <b>Loni Love</b>, 49, on Instagram for <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/23/porsha-williams-slams-loni-love-mocking-relationship-dennis-mckinley-video/">apparently criticizing her relationship</a> with Dennis on the Nov. 22 episode of <i>The Real</i>. “Let me tell you something, Porsha trying to get that reality show,” the comedian said amid the other women talking about the couple.</p>
      <p>“B***h F you! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fakeass/">#FakeAss</a> don’t run up smiling when I see you!” Porsha captioned in a now-deleted Instagram clip from the show. Loni apologized to her within that post, so perhaps the two have already made up?</p>
