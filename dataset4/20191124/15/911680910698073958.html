      <p>PHOENIX â€” A 75-year-old man who had been reported missing on Saturday was struck and killed while crossing the street near I-17 and Greenway Road, according to Phoenix police.</p>
      <p>Robert T. Joey, 75, was last seen walking away from Christown Mall earlier in the day. Police say Joey was crossing Greenway Road, not in a crosswalk, around 1:15 a.m. when he was struck by a 26-year-old driving a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta Sedan.</p>
      <p>Police say the driver of the Jetta observed Joey in the roadway just before the fatal crash, but was "unable to stop or avoid the collision."</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old driver remained on scene, according to police. Impairment and speed do not appear to be factors.</p>
