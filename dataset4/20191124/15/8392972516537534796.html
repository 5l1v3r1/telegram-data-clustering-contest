      <p>Dec Donnelly hilariously told his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> presenting pal <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> he was going to 'take over' after he fluffed his lines on last night's show.</p>
      <p>The pair were introducing a segment when Ant got his words muddled up not once, but twice.</p>
      <p>"So with the full...," Ant began before struggling to get his lines out.</p>
      <p>"The twelve celebs all headed back to camp and waiting for them... waiting for them there," he continued.</p>
