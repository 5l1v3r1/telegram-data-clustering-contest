      <p><b>SAITAMA, Japan —</b> Salem Al-Dawsari and Bafetimbi Gomis were the heroes as Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal beat Urawa Red Diamonds 2-0 on Sunday and 3-0 on aggregate to claim a record-equaling third Asian club title in the AFC Champions League.<br/><br/>Al-Dawsari scored with 16 minutes left and top-scorer Gomis grabbed his 11th of the competition in injury time as the Saudi giants ended a 19-year wait for their third continental trophy, joining South Korea's Pohang Steelers as the only three-time Asian champions.<br/><br/>Al Hilal completed a historic win following their first leg 1-0 victory at the King Saud University Stadium two weeks ago with a clinical display in the second-leg as the home side labored in the later stages of the game to yield territory and goals.<br/><br/>Al-Hilal, beaten by Japan's Urawa in the 2017 final, also became the competition's first West Asian winners since Qatar's Al-Sadd in 2011, torpedoing a run of victories by clubs from Japan, South Korea, China and Australia.<br/><br/>But Razvan Lucescu’s side on Sunday, in front of a boisterous crowd of 58,109 at a pulsating Saitama Stadium, turned in a performance befitting a champion.<br/><br/>Al-Hilal had the better of the opening half as they looked to build on their 1-0 win in the first leg, when Andre Carrillo scored the only goal. Both goalkeepers were forced into action early on, but it was Urawa's Takahiro Sekine who had the best chance of the half when his point-blank volley was scrambled away by Hilal custodian Abdullah Al-Mayoof.<br/><br/>After the break tournament top-scorer Gomis, with 10 goals en route to the final, drew a reaction save from Shuzaku Nishikawa when he connected with a menacing cross at the near post.<br/><br/>Gomis found Nishikawa in his path once again when he chested down Sebastian Giovinco's cross and side-footed his volley straight at the Urawa goalkeeper.<br/><br/>However, they were ominous signs for the hosts and Al-Hilal finally prised open the Urawa defense with a sweeping move in the 74th minute.<br/><br/>Man-of-the-match Giovinco provided the final ball for Al-Dawsari, who gratefully prodded home the winner after a sequence of passes that caught out the backpedalling Urawa defenders.<br/><br/>Gomis came within inches of connecting with a diving header in the dying moments, but the towering forward was not to be denied later as he smashed in Al Hilal's second in the third minute of injury time.<br/><br/>The Saudi giants have endured a continental trophy drought since 2000 when they won the tournament for the second time, the first being in 1991 when it was called the Asian Club Championship.<br/><br/>They came close in 2014 and 2017 when they reached the final, only to be beaten by Western Sydney Wanderers and Urawa respectively.<br/><br/>Al Hilal’s Gomis scored a double of Sunday as he was named the 2019 AFC Champions League MVP and won the Top Scorer award.<br/><br/>Gomis scored 11 goals in Al Hilal's campaign with the former France international scoring his side’s second goal in Sunday's 2-0 second leg win here. Gomis' goals and leadership played a pivotal role in Al Hilal's triumph.<br/><br/>"I want to say that I’m happy to win this individual prize, but the collective prize was our main target ahead of the game.<br/><br/>"This team was born from day one when we started to work in our camp in Austria. We have a lot of individual talents, but the collective part of the work is very important to bring this all together," said Gomis.<br/><br/>"I want to say thank you to our coach for strengthening the collective ability of the team and I want to thank him for bringing Al Hilal onto the right track after 20 years of missing the Asian title. Our coach and the players all deserve to be Asian champions today."<br/><br/>Urawa, meanwhile, won the Fairplay award. — AFP/SG</p>
