      <p><b>Angelina Jolie</b> has not been telling <b>Brad Pitt</b> that their kids “hate his guts,” despite a false report claiming the actress is trying to poison her children against their dad. The story is completely made-up. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk it.</p>
      <p>According to the <i><b>National Enquirer</b></i>, Jolie is taking her custody battle “to the next level” by trash-talking Pitt to their children and actively trying to turn them against him. An alleged source says the actress has been telling her estranged husband that the kids hate him, but that hasn’t deterred him from trying to spend more time with them.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t buy Angie’s theory that the kids don’t want to be with him anymore, and he’ll fight her with everything’s he got,” adds the supposed insider. “He’s convinced she’s poisoned them against him. If Angie thinks she can bully Brad into not having a relationship with his own kids, she’s got another thing coming!”</p>
      <p>The tabloid’s report is yet another weak attempt at painting Jolie as a villain in her divorce. Similar narratives have cropped up in the past, but this ongoing storyline just isn’t accurate. An individual in the actress’s camp confirms to <b>Gossip Cop</b> that the magazine’s article is “absolute nonsense.” Jolie has had her kids’ best interests in mind throughout her custody battle. The idea that she’s mentally and emotionally manipulating them is baseless.</p>
      <p>It should be noted, <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29644077/angelina-jolie-interview-2019/">Jolie said in her <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> cover story</a> earlier this month that she’d prefer to live abroad with her kids, but she lives with them in Los Angeles because it’s “where their father chooses to live.” In other words, the actress is willing to adjust her lifestyle to allow the kids to see their dad, despite not being too content with doing so. <b>Gossip Cop</b> will certainly acknowledge that Pitt and Jolie’s divorce has been contentious, but the idea that she’s launched some sort of hate campaign against him isn’t true.</p>
      <p>Last week, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the <i>Enquirer</i> for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-child-support/">Jolie was plotting to escape from Pitt with her kids</a>. This latest article, while covering a similar theme, doesn’t actually mention that phony scenario. One would think Jolie’s alleged escape plan would be worth mentioning if it were a reality.</p>
      <p>Just last month, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the magazine for making up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-daughter-shiloh/">Pitt and Jolie’s daughter Shiloh begging her dad to save her</a> from her mom. The outlet seems to be all over the place when it comes to the family’s dynamic. However, all of these articles feature a common thread about Jolie being the bad guy. It’s just not an accurate assessment of the situation, and the tabloids don’t have any insight into Pitt and Jolie’s divorce proceedings.</p>
