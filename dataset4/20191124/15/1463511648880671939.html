      <h1>Election Violence: APC chieftain urges National Assembly to enact stiffer legislation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:36:39+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>A member of the All Progressives Congress, Alhaji Mustapha Audu, has called on the National Assembly to come up with stiffer sanctions to check election violence in the country.</p>
      <p>Audu made the call while addressing newsmen to commemorate the fourth anniversary of his father, late former governor of Kogi, Prince Abubakar Audu on Sunday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said: “The National Assembly should come up with stiffer sanctions to punish those who engage in election violence.”</p>
      <p>He said that the National Assembly should not only come up with stiffer sanctions, but to also ensure that security agencies arrest and prosecute such offenders.</p>
      <p>The politician added that security personnel who compromised when violence was being unleashed on the people, during elections, should be sanctioned accordingly.</p>
      <p>Audu said that this would deter would- be electoral offenders from committing the crime.</p>
      <p>He urged the media to always put pressure on the political class and Independent National Electoral Commission to abide by the electoral Act by exposing their excesses.</p>
      <p>Audu described the violence that characterised the November 16 Kogi governorship and senatorial elections as a shame and unnecessary.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is a thing of shame for every kogi person tha, we as a people, cannot express our views peacefully during elections.</p>
      <p>“We set up a centre to review reports of election violence and what we saw was overwhelming.”</p>
      <p>Audu called on security agencies to ensure that those who partook in election violence were sanctioned, according to the law, no matter how highly placed in the society.</p>
      <p>He also called on the electorate to always hold politicians responsible for their campaign promises and vote against them if they failed to fulfil such promises.</p>
      <p>Audu appealed to all members of the party and stakeholders in Kogi to close rank irrespective of the differences, to forge ahead.</p>
      <p>On programmes lined up for his father`s anniversary, he said that the millennium builders’ plaza in Abuja would be named after his late father.</p>
      <p>Audu also said the family would visit children in his village to make some interventios in line with the late Audu`s vision.</p>
      <p>He said that the essence of the anniversary was to ensure that his father’s legacies in all aspects of human endeavour live on in spite his death.</p>
      <p>Late Audu, the first democratically elected governor of the 28-year-old kogi, died in 2016 during the governorship election in the state in which he sought re-election on the platform of APC.</p>
