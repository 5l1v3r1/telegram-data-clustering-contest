      <h1>Officials in Siem Reap cleared of corruption</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:29:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Khorn Savi</a></address>
      <p>Anti-corruption Unit (ACU) head Om Yentieng on Wednesday cleared Keut Vannareth, the prosecutor of the Siem Reap provincial court, and Nguon Nara, its president, of corruption allegations.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after Cambodian Journalist Association for Peace vice-president Sim Chhiv Chhean Piseth accused Boeng Pearaing Natural Tourism Community head Kong Mongkul of conspiring with Siem Reap town ’s Chreav commune chief Kdob Rorn and deputy chief Kong Boeub to bribe Nara and Vannareth with $50,000 to bury a criminal case filed on February 7.</p>
      <p>The case involved Chhean Piseth’s complaint against Mongkul and other community members for allegedly attempting to beat him to death.</p>
      <p>The ACU noted that the criminal case had already been investigated by the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>“The action taken in the above case shows that the Siem Reap provincial court prosecutor and investigating judge had carried out their roles under the law,” the letter said.</p>
      <p>Addressing Chhean Piseth, the letter stated: “Please don’t misunderstand that the court did not take action.</p>
      <p>“There is no evidence to prove that the court accepted a bribe to bury the case without taking legal action.</p>
      <p>“Please respect the court procedure.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Spoke rudely’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Siem Reap provincial court spokesman Yin Sreang declined to comment as he has yet to check the case.</p>
      <p>Neither Chhean Piseth nor Mongkul could be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>Khmer 7 Makara News and Today’s News in January wrote that Chhean Piseth was beaten unconscious around 7pm on January 26, by about 20 people who were said to be Mongkul’s known subordinates.</p>
      <p>Chhean Piseth was said to be investigating illegal fishing at Pearaing Lake in Siem Reap town’s Chreav commune.</p>
      <p>Mongkul denied the allegations on January 30. “I reject and deny the accusation concerning this case.</p>
      <p>“There were many people there including tourists and campers who took photos of birds and about 20 members of the community who weren’t carrying any weapons or tools.</p>
      <p>“The incident took place when Chhean Piseth entered the place to take photos without valid reasons and without cooperating with the community.</p>
      <p>“He spoke rudely, slandered and defamed [the members of the community] which sparked anger and accidental violence,” he said.</p>
