        <b>Sale Sharks chalked up their first win of this season's Champions Cup as they overcame a battling La Rochelle 25-15 in Pool 2 on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rohan Janse van Rensburg put the Sharks in the ascendancy at the AJ Bell Stadium with a try inside the opening 10 minutes and they were unfortunate not to add to that tally when Chris Ashton had an effort chalked off for a forward pass.</p>
      <p>La Rochelle's task got harder when hooker Pierre Bougarit was dismissed for an act of foul play just before half-time and although they showed dogged determination, a penalty try and score from Ashton after the break sealed the win for the hosts.</p>
