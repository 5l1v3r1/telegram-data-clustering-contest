        <b>On Sunday, Aston Villa manager Dean Smith made it clear that he has no intentions to sell John McGinn, amidst interest from Manchester United.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“There’s been a lot of speculation about a lot of our players,” Smith said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“But we’ve two owners who want to build a football club, challenging in the top half of the table, and top six in a few years’ time.”</p>
      <p>From the above message, it seems likely that Aston Villa will reject any offer for McGinn from Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old midfielder has been one of Villa’s most impressive players so far this season, and was also responsible for their promotion to the Premier League in the 2018-19 season. Earlier last month, it was also reported that Sir Alex Ferguson is very interested for him to join Manchester United.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://theathletic.com/1264259/2019/10/04/meet-bobby-jenks-the-scout-who-told-villa-to-sign-mcginn-whos-never-met-him-and-was-sacked-before-he-arrived/"><i>The Athletic</i></a>, Dave Jenks – the scout who helped bring the Scotland international to Aston Villa – said that the legendary manager will be using his influence to attempt to lure McGinn to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>“He’s up there with the best-performing midfielders in the division,” Jenks said.</p>
      <p>“Wait until he’s had a year at that level and then we can say more.”</p>
      <p>“What I do know is that Sir Alex Ferguson is wondering why United let a talented Scottish boy slip through,” he added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“He’ll be keeping a close eye on him that’s for sure and if he continues the way he is, you can bet he’ll be telling his pals at United, too.”</p>
