      <p>DUBLIN KINGPINS ST Vincent’s have been crowned Leinster AIB senior club camogie champions after beating defending champions St Martin’s of Wexford.</p>
      <p>A replay was required to separate the sides after their 0-10 a-piece draw last weekend, and it was third time lucky in the Leinster decider for the Marino outfit as they ended last season’s All-Ireland finalists’ campaign.</p>
      <p>Today was St Vincent’s third senior final in five years — they had lost the last two by a single point. It comes as their first provincial crown since 1998.</p>
      <p>Germaine Noonan’s Dubliners had the dream start at Carlow IT as an Alison Maguire free and an Ellen McGovern goal had them 1-1 to 0-0 up after just two minutes.</p>
      <p>Wexford star Chloe Foxe stepped up to lead the St Martin’s charge with several well-taken points and a bullet of a goal from there, bringing her side level at 1-5 a-piece with 21 minutes played.</p>

      <p>Maguire and Amy Cardiff traded points just before the break, leaving for a big second half. Vincent’s came back out all guns blazing, but were soon stopped in their tracks as Foxe had the ball in the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Referee John Dermody overruled the goal, however, deeming it to be a square ball.</p>

      <p>Things went from bad to worse for JJ Doyle’s charges in the final 10 minutes as a Niamh Hetherton pointed effort deceived Mags D’Arcy between the posts and pushed St Vincent’s into a 2-9 to 1-7 lead.</p>

      <p>Maguire kept the scoreboard ticking over as the clock ran down, while St Martin’s missed a few chances. In the five additional minutes, they grabbed a second goal but it was too little, too late as the game ended 2-11 to 2-9.</p>
      <p>On they go, as just the second Dublin club to win Leinster since Ballyboden in 2008.</p>
