      <p>Friends concerned for her Solis' welfare found her body in the trunk of Brown's car in the driveway last week. She was found stabbed.</p>
      <p>Police say Brown was arrested just days before on Nov. 9 for aggravated assault and domestic battery after he cut Solis with a knife. He bonded out of jail and she dropped the charges, according to police.</p>
      <p>Detectives also found photos of the couple and bloody clothing in the trunk, as well. When they went inside the home, they found blood spatter on the ceiling of two rooms.</p>
      <p>Warren later admitted to police that he stabbed Solis and placed her in the trunk of his car.</p>
      <p>Police said the couple had a history of domestic violence issues.</p>
