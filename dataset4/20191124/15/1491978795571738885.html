        <i>Chris Martin’s stadium-fillers return, with lyrics that could set the liberal cause back decades</i>
      </p>
      <p>In the four years since the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay">Coldplay’s </a>last album, the relentlessly upbeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/06/coldplay-a-head-full-of-dreams-review"><i>A Head Full of Dreams,</i></a> the world has become a more divided place. That sense of unease permeates the band’s eighth set – Trouble in Town pontificating on racial politics in the US, even if the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4exZ-jXgWE&amp;feature=youtu.be">chilling sample of police harassment</a> that anchors the powerful second half of the song actually dates from 2013. The excruciating Guns is rather less sure-footed, as Chris Martin – never Bob Dylan when it’s come to writing lyrics, in fact barely Noel Gallagher – makes a clumsy pass at satire (“Who needs education, or a thousand splendid suns/ Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they’re so dumb”), swears gratuitously and probably sets the liberal cause back decades.</p>
      <p>It’s not all geopolitical angst: recent single Arabesque is as good as anything they’ve done in the last 10 years, with French lyrics and echoes of the intensity of Primal Scream’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGwi15p0YmE">If They Move Kill ’Em</a> refracted through a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Skronk">skronking</a> jazz filter. But they’re rather less engaging when they hit the stadium preset buttons, whether it’s appropriating gospel sounds in the style of late-80s U2 (BrokEn), churning out mawkish balladry (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWhiCkEY-Yk&amp;feature=youtu.be">Daddy</a>) or mistaking empty bombast for euphoria (Champion of the World).</p>
