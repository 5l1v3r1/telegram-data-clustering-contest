        <b>A review of Sunday's action in the Heineken Champions Cup as Sale battled past La Rochelle.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Sunday's results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sale 25-15 La Rochelle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>World Cup winner Faf De Klerk made a triumphant return to club rugby as <b>Sale Sharks</b> fought their way to a scrappy 25-15 win over <b>La Rochelle </b>in the Heineken Champions Cup at the AJ Bell Stadium.</p>
      <p>Former England winger Chris Ashton scored a competition record-extending 40th try but the Premiership club made hard work of securing their first win of this year's tournament against undisciplined opponents who had one man sent off and two others sin-binned.</p>
      <p>France hooker Pierre Bourgarit was handed a red card three minutes before half-time for appearing to eye gouge returning England flanker Tom Curry, while lock Remi Leroux and prop Dany Priso saw yellow for technical infringements.</p>
      <p>The returns of De Klerk and Curry, who was named man of the match, were among nine changes to the team that took a bonus point from a 13-7 defeat at Glasgow and there was a lack of cohesion at times.</p>
      <p>The result effectively puts La Rochelle out of contention following a 31-12 home defeat by Exeter but sets up the Sharks for their home tie against the unbeaten Chiefs in a fortnight's time.</p>
