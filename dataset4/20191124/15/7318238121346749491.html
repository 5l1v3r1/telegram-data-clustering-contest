      <p>Romania's centre-right President Klaus Iohannis won a second term early Monday, crushing his socialist challenger in a presidential election runoff with a pledge to resume judicial reforms slowed down by successive Social Democrat (PSD) governments.</p>
      <p>Two separate exit polls showed Iohannis garnered 64%-67% of the vote, with former prime minister Viorica Dancila of the left-leaning PSD taking 33-36%.</p>
      <p>"The winner today is modern Romania, European Romania, the normal Romania," Iohannis told reporters in his victory speech.</p>
      <p>Under a succession of PSD governments, Romania has rolled back anti-corruption measures. Along with ex-communist peers Poland and Hungary, it has been heavily criticised by Brussels for its actions.</p>
      <p>However, 60-year-old Iohannis has been credited by Western allies and the European Union with trying to protect the rule of law, in particular by challenging attempts to limit judges' independence.</p>
      <p>The president's powers are mostly limited to nominating a prime minister on the basis of who can command a majority, challenging laws in the Constitutional Court, and appointing some chief prosecutors.</p>

      <p>Iohannis will now have a chance to install anti-corruption and anti-mafia prosecutors who are serious about tackling endemic corruption.</p>
      <p>His plan has the backing of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, who became head of a liberal minority government by winning a parliamentary vote of confidence three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Viorica Dancila's PSD had increased the burden of proof in corruption cases, reorganised panels of judges and set up a special unit to investigate magistrates for potential abuses, a move widely seen as an instrument of political coercion.</p>
      <p>Romania's judicial reforms have been monitored by Brussels since it joined the EU in 2007; in October, Brussels said the reforms were going backwards.</p>
      <p>Iohannis, a soft-spoken ethnic German and former mayor of Sibiu, became president in 2014.</p>
      <p>He helped to secure popular approval for a referendum last May that proposed a ban on governments altering legislation by emergency decree and a ban on pardons for corruption-related crimes.</p>
