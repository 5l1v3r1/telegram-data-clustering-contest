      <p>Driving into The Boulevards estate, the first thing to negotiate is a giant pothole, quickly followed by a higgledy-piggledy patchwork of Tarmac, concrete and raised drains.</p>
      <p>The kerbstones at the roadside appear unfinished and makeshift Tarmac ramps have been dumped on the corners to access the pavement.</p>
      <p>You would be forgiven for thinking this Persimmon-built estate in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/newport">Newport</a> has just been built. But the houses, and the roads through the development, have actually been there for more than four years.</p>
      <p>Twelve months ago, residents vented their frustrations about <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/persimmon-estates-left-unfinished-years-15379646">the nuisance and damage being caused by the state of the roads</a> on the estate .</p>
      <p>With the pavements still not finished, residents worry it will affect the price of their homes and paint the estate in a negative light.</p>

      <p>Bethany Payne moved on to the estate in August and said the condition of pavements makes it difficult for her to leave her home in her electric wheelchair. She said she has to use the middle of the road instead.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old graduate said she and her partner moved to their rental home on the estate to be close to the neighbouring Office for National Statistics where her partner works.</p>
      <p>Miss Payne's health means she currently does not work. She said her main trip out is to go to nearby Asda, which she manages a couple of times a week, but even that is fraught with difficulties.</p>
      <p>"It's so hard to get off the pavement and onto the road," she said.</p>
      <p>"I have to line my chair up exactly right. I can't use any of the paths because I don't know if I can get off the pavement, so I just drive down the road.</p>
      <p>"There are so many big puddles in the road, and my wheelchair is electric powered. I dread to think the wear and tear that it must be doing.</p>
      <p>"It's supposed to be a normal pavement, but even going to Asda is a real struggle."</p>

      <p>She said she can't even enjoy visiting nearby Tredegar House.</p>
      <p>"I should be able to go over and enjoy that but there are so many bumps in the road. I don't have the right suspension for that terrain so it throws my body all over the place."</p>
      <p>Miss Payne said the letting agent told them the roads were due to be completed and it wasn't until they moved in that she realised it was an ongoing issue.</p>
      <p>"I realised it had been like that ever since they were built four years ago," she said.</p>
      <p>"We suddenly realised what we had done. It looks like it has just been built, not like people have been living here for four years."</p>

      <p>Another resident, who bought her new house from Persimmon in December 2015, said the roads had been in a "dreadful" state ever since she moved in. Right outside her three-bedroom home, a makeshift Tarmac ramp is the only way to get off the unsurfaced pavement onto the road.</p>
      <p>The homeowner, who did not want to be named, had resigned herself to the fact that is just how it is on the estate and said the main difficulty was taking the pushchair out.</p>
      <p>"We get letters from Persimmon but they keep saying it will be done and then nothing gets done," she said.</p>
      <p>In the next street, another resident, who rents her home, said it wasn't just the road surfaces that were problematic.</p>

      <p>She claimed there had been drainage problems on the estate ever since she moved in four years ago and said parts of the drainage system had begun to collapse under the roads and needed to be dug up and repaired.</p>
      <p>"Water has backed up into our drainage in our house," she said.</p>
      <p>"It has caused awful problems all over the estate. There's an area of green open space at the far end and that is always waterlogged and flooded in the rain.</p>
      <p>"Persimmon told us it was because of Cuddy Group but why didn't they do the work properly in the first place? I just feel sorry for the people who bought their own house and took out a mortgage."</p>
      <p>There are 250 houses and apartments on the estate off Pencarn Way. The majority of these are privately owned and there are around 60 affordable homes.</p>
      <p>Sold as an "exclusive semi-rural development of desirable homes", a three-bed house on the estate typically goes for around Â£240,000.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, Persimmon blamed Cuddy for the state of the roads on the estate. The company said: "Our sub-contractor, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cuddy-group-folds-result-directors-14938001">Cuddy, went into administration earlier this year</a> before completing the estate roads, footpaths and sewers. A new sub-contractor has been appointed and they will begin works to complete the estate in the week commencing November 5. This will be communicated to all residents."</p>

      <p>Twelve months on and a spokesman for the housebuilder has confirmed works are due to be completed in summer 2020. He said: "As previously confirmed, there have been issues with the estate infrastructure at The Boulevards due to our contractor, Cuddy Group, going into administration and ultimately folding.</p>
      <p>"Consequently, Persimmon Homes has had to follow due process with regards to commencing the required remedial works at the development. This work commenced in November 2018 and it is anticipated that this will be ongoing until summer 2020.</p>
      <p>"The initial aim of the works was to provide a serviceable drainage and road network to the residents, which is now complete, and then focus on undertaking the additional remedial items required to satisfy DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water and Newport City Council for future adoption.</p>
      <p>"We apologise to residents for the inconvenience but we continue to strive to make this development an excellent place to live."</p>
      <p>He admitted that "remedial" work was also required on the site in respect of drainage, but said the sewer system was not in danger of collapse.</p>
      <p>The spokesman added: "There are some raised inspection covers and kerbs in areas where the final surface course has not been laid and works are ongoing. These are monitored regularly by the site team and repairs are undertaken when required.</p>
      <p>"If any issues have been raised by residents in terms of blockages, the site team have actioned these immediately and to date we have found these to be typical blockages found in drainage systems across other developments."</p>
