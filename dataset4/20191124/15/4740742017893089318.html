      <h2>Every word from the manager after 3-4 victory over Shrewsbury Town.</h2>

      <h3>Graham, I’m not entirely sure where start with that, but congratulations on the three points.</h3>
      <p>I just wanted to, from my point of view and the players, the fans and Bristol Rovers football club, we want to send our best wishes on to Christian Edwards who had an incident on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>We would just like to pass our best wishes on to him and his family, I’m sure the fans will echo that as well. He’s somewhat of a legend at Bristol Rovers as well and our thoughts and prayers are with him this evening.</p>
      <h3>Absolutely echo that, and in a way a bit of a fillip, another three points on the road...</h3>
      <p>It was nice, it was nice but let me tell you my heart was in my mouth to be quite honest with you, it’s not like us to concede sloppy, silly, basic goals like that.</p>
      <p>I guess it was just one of those games, one of those days, we have done our best to chuck it away if I’m being honest, but I thought the performance was absolutely magnificent, I have to take my hat off to them.</p>
      <p>We should’ve had five, six, seven goals in us today if we’d capitalised a bit more, I thought the boys were magnificent, the way they played, moved the ball, and created.</p>

      <h3>That first-half, in particular, you kept them at arm’s length the whole way through, they didn’t seem like they were going to get a chance and then that sort of sloppy goal gave them a foothold.</h3>
      <p>Yeah, it was just the basics, we’re normally a very good team at basics, we don’t normally concede goals like that, to be honest, we’re normally much better in the areas.</p>
      <p>Like I say, it’s probably one of them days, yet again these lads have come from 3-3 and come from the face of adversity and they’ve stepped up, I’ve not got enough praise for them, they’re a brilliant group.</p>
      <p>The way we’ve played today, people will judge, people will comment, but I thought we were magnificent today</p>
      <h3>As long as you keep showing that fighting spirit it will keep you in any game.</h3>
      <p>Yeah, it will, it’s nice to come out the other end with the victory, with the three points, but for a horrible moment there I thought we’d chucked it, I thought we’d lose two points to be fair, it was a action-packed game of football.</p>
      <p>We had a number of chances, I don’t think they had too many, I would’ve liked us to be a bit more comfortable, but you know Bristol Rovers, we don’t do things easily, but look it’s another victory on the road, I think that’s 8/9 wins now from 16 games, so we’re shifting, we’re moving, I couldn’t do too many of the afternoon’s, to be honest.</p>
      <h3>It was getting quite feisty out there, were you just trying to get cool heads in there at the break?</h3>
      <p>No, I wanted to go on the pitch, one of their players used his hands and the referee, whether they chose to dismiss it or not to see it, I wanted to go on the pitch, I don’t like cowardly acts.</p>
      <h3>The incident that led to all that, the penalty which I’m sure Sam Rickets won’t be happy with that, what did you see of that?</h3>
      <p>I thought the referee called it pretty spot on, to be honest, it was a simulation, the referees an experienced lad so he’s not going to fall for things like that.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we should have been 3-0 up because there was nothing wrong with the goal we scored, and I think at 3-0, maybe the game might have been done, but I think on another day, the game was never going to be done until the referee blew the final whistle.</p>
      <p>We were disappointed that the third goal didn’t stand to go 3-0 up, it’s an error from the linesman.</p>
      <h3>It’s amazing how often it happens isn’t it, Abs Ogogo pops, not a goal-scoring midfielder is he, but took his chance brilliantly.</h3>
      <p>That’s his second one this season, season away goals this season, he’s had many opportunities as well, he’s come close on several occasions.</p>
      <p>We’re just trying to encourage bodies into the box, get coverage in the box, it was a nice touch, he obviously chose not to celebrate because he’s played here so we don’t dig into him, to be honest.</p>

      <h3>Do you feel that things are starting to build a little bit, a little bit of momentum coming <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a>' way?</h3>
      <p>I think we’re onto something, we’re definitely onto something yes.</p>
      <p>To do this job is hard, you have to be a certain character to manage this football club, I find it tough, the lack of support, maybe the lack of backing, I do find it tough, but that dressing room in there is absolutely magnificent, they get behind us and put their heart down for this football club.</p>
      <p>I just wish people would give us a little bit more of a chance, to be honest, nobody else will do it, so I may as well do it. The job we’ve done here in 12 months is absolutely unbelievable.</p>
      <h3>Just to be clear when you’re saying backing, the fans here, or are we talking the club?</h3>
      <p>I’d like a little bit of support, somebody just realise the job we’re doing, a little bit of moral support, they were singing our names there at the end which was nice, but it is tough, I do get battered by the fans, to be honest, but that’s part and parcel of the job.</p>
      <p>I just want to reassure everyone that I love this job, it’s not going to be pretty every week, but we are onto something and if we can be a little bit more positive then who knows where we can go and who knows what we can do, the fans have been great, but when we don’t play well I’d just love them to get behind us.</p>

      <p>They’re good, honest, hardworking lads and I can’t speak highly enough of them and together we’re stronger and if we’re all together and we’re all in this you just never know where you’re going to go.</p>
      <h3>Graham, a bit of an unconventional formation with the six in midfield today but it seemed to get the best out of Ollie Clarke and Liam Sercombe...</h3>
      <p>We lost JCH obviously which was a blow to us so we had to quickly change our game plan and change our system, I just felt that when we went to Rochdale we used a similar system and we won there but we came under a little bit of pressure in the second half and I wasn’t comfortable with that away at Rochdale so I just tried to get us on the front foot to make us a little bit more dangerous in midfield.</p>
      <p>I thought they were brilliant, I thought Sercombe, Ollie Clarke, Ed, Abs Ogogo I thought they were excellent.</p>
      <h3>The second goal came shortly after the handbags following the penalty decision, were you pleased with the way the players did keep their heads and were able to extend the lead?</h3>
      <p>It was feisty today, we did have a number of incidents, the goal, the simulation, the goal we didn’t get, the referee booked one of our players for some unknown reason, our striker was at the other end of the pitch and managed to pick up a yellow card so that one needs explaining, to be honest.</p>
      <p>Our lads are well drilled, their discipline is and has been excellent, touch wood it continues, they are disciplined.</p>
