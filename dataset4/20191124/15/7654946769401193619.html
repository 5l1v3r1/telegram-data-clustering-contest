      <p>The five children of the missing Connecticut mom Jennifer Dulos are “healthy and well” — despite Sunday marking the six-month anniversary of her mysterious disappearance, her family said.</p>
      <p>Dulos, 51, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/30/jennifer-dulos-family-vows-to-bring-missing-connecticut-mom-home/">disappeared from her New Canaan home</a> on May 24 while locked in a contentious divorce battle.</p>
      <p>“It has now been six months since Jennifer Farber Dulos was reported missing. That this milestone coincides with the Thanksgiving holiday challenges us to pause and give thanks, in spite of this tragedy,” the family said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The missing mom’s children — two sets of twins and another daughter — are in the custody of her mother, Gloria Farber, as authorities investigate her disappearance.</p>
      <p>Her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, have been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/24/mysterious-grecian-benefactor-footing-legal-fees-for-jennifer-dulos-accused-hubby/">arrested in the case</a> for allegedly tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution.</p>
      <p>“We give thanks that Jennifer’s children are healthy and well,” the family said. “We give thanks that they share their mother’s deep sense of empathy and curiosity about the world around them.”</p>
      <p>The family urged others to acknowledge the anniversary of her disappearance with acts of kindness.</p>
      <p>“In honor of Jennifer, we encourage acts of caring and generosity this holiday season, whether donations to a local food bank or shelter or other gestures of compassion,” the statement said. “Hug your loved ones close and extend a hand to a stranger.”</p>
