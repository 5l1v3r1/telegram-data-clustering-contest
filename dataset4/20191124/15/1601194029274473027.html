      <p>Talking about the players to watch out for, Shane Watson will hold the key to success for the Deccan Gladiators as the Aussie all-rounder has performed well as an opener in this tourney. The Chennai Super Kings star will expect Kieron Pollard and Mohammad Shahzad to contribute their bit in the batting department.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Maratha Arabians will rest their hopes on the big-match players Yuvraj Singh, Lasith Malinga and Dwayne Bravo. All the three players have won a host of tournaments in their glorious cricket careers thus, they will have the onus of guiding the Arabians to the T10 League championship tonight. Besides, Chris Lynn will look to continue his fine form in the most important match of the tourney.</p>
