      <p>Previously, <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259025/michael-bloomberg-apologizes-for-stop-and-frisk-methods-used-by-nypd">Michael Bloomberg publicly apologized for his hand in the “stop and frisk” policing</a> that took place in New York City. Now, Bloomberg has revealed that he is running for president in 2020.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old former New York City mayor issued a statement recently, saying, “I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions. He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.” Watch his ad above. </p>
