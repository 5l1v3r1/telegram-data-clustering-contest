      <p>Fans of Elsa and Anna have been flocking to cinemas this weekend as Frozen 2 opens across the UK.</p>
      <p>The sequel reunites the two sisters in the follow-up to the 2013 animated smash, with trouble brewing in the kingdom of Arendelle and the characters forced to venture into mysterious new lands to save their home.</p>
      <p>You might well be heading out to see it with younger members of the family in the coming weeks – but just how long is the film, and what’s this we’re hearing about a post-credits scene?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How long is Frozen 2?</h3>
      <p>Frozen 2 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/frozen-2-uk-running-time-11071640/">runs for one hour and 43 minutes.</a></p>
      <p>That makes it six minutes shorter than its predecessor, which stopped just 11 minutes short of the two-hour mark.</p>

      <p>So you’re getting a little less Anna and Elsa for your dosh, but with the return of favourite characters including Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Olaf the snowman (Josh Gad) as well as newcomers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/16/frozen-2-sterling-k-brown-evan-rachel-wood-join-cast-disney-sequel-7720527/">voiced by Evan Rachel Wood and Sterling K Brown</a>, there’s still plenty to keep junior cinemagoers – and their grown-up companions – entertained.</p>

      <p>Plus, you’re getting a whole load of new songs <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/30/frozen-2-sneak-peak-gives-us-snippet-stunning-new-track-unknown-10835024/">including Into The Unknown</a> – which will more than make up for the lack of Let It Go this time around.</p>
      <h3>What happens in Frozen 2?</h3>
      <p>Although the plot details were kept pretty quiet ahead of release, the trailer previously revealed that Elsa and Anna are set to journey beyond Arendelle in a bid to discover the origin of Elsa’s powers, and save their kingdom.</p>

      <h3>Does Frozen have a post-credits scene?</h3>
      <p>Frozen 2 does indeed have a post-credits scene, so you’ll need to stick around for the entire closing credits to get your little extra bit of Frozen.</p>
      <p>We’re not going to give away what happens, but let’s just say fans of Olaf – and in particular of one moment earlier on in the film – will be very pleased indeed.</p>
