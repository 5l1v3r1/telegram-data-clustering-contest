        <b>Former footballer and head coach of the Netherlands national team Marco van Basten has been involved in a scandal by uttering a Nazi slogan during a pre-match interview ahead of a Dutch Eredivisie clash between AFC Ajax and Heracles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marco van Basten has been forced to apologise for his "racist" remark during an interview with Fox Sports when he said, "Sieg Heil!" which technically means "Hail Victory" and was a victory salute originally used by the Nazis at political rallies, Der Spiegel reported. ​The phrase has enraged people in the Netherlands, causing a major scandal.</p>
      <blockquote>"It was not my intention at all to shock people. I only wanted to 'explain' Hans' German", Van Basten said as quoted by Der Spiegel, adding that it was just a "misplaced joke".</blockquote>
      <p>The Fox Sports broadcaster has also apologised, saying that the comment was inappropriate, "not only for today but for every day".</p>

      <p>Van Basten's comment comes amid a week of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201910241077139347-bulgarian-twin-walks-free-after-being-mistakenly-charged-with-racism-at-england-match/">extra emphasis on fighting racism</a> in Dutch football clubs. Teams are engaging in a moment of silence before the start of matches.</p>
      <p>Last week, a second division match between Den Bosch and Excelsior Rotterdam was briefly suspended by the referee following racist chants directed at Rotterdam player Ahmad Mendes Moreira.</p>
