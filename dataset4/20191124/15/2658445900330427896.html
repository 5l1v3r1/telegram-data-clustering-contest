      <p>Former member of the Federal House of Representatives and an international lawyer of repute, Prince Ned Nwoko has urged members of the Association of Ex-Local Government Chairmen of Nigeria (ASELGON) to be committed to nation building.</p>
      <p>Nwoko spoke during his investiture as the Grand Patron of the Association in his mansion in Idumuje Ugboko, Delta State on Saturday 23rd November, 2019.</p>
      <p>The politician stated that the responsibility was big for him as the first grand patron of the association, adding that he would do his best to support their ideals.</p>
      <p>“I have no doubt that with little support and your zeal, you will play a lot of roles in nation building. I am a grassroots person also, even if you have 30% support across all the local governments, you can make a lot of difference,” he said.</p>
      <p>The former lawmaker told the members of the association that their job required consistency and commitment.</p>
      <p>He lamented that Nigeria is a country of survival of the fittest unlike Britain, which he said was different because, according to him, they understand that politics is all about service.</p>
      <p>“I will support your cause and join hands with you so that we can all move Nigeria forward.</p>
      <p>“My joy is to see that Nigeria catches up with the rest of the world and we can achieve a lot of things together with unity and commitment to our cause as a group and individually,” he said, while commending the members of ASELGON for coming up with such an association.</p>
      <p>Nwoko however, said that what was needed in Nigeria was a level of exposure and the zeal to do what is right.</p>
      <p>According to him, if we have 60% of the people in offices understanding why they were elected, Nigeria would be better.</p>

      <p>He regretted that the country had not laid the foundation for good governance, while saying that he was non-partisan within him.</p>
      <p>While saying that he could be more comfortable living abroad, he said that he preferred to stay in Nigeria and urged the people to live above religious sentiments.</p>
      <p>Earlier in his address, the National President of ASELGON, Hon. Albert Asipa said that the Forum was inaugurated in 2013 as an umbrella body for ex-local government chairmen to provide a platform for them as experienced individuals who still have a lot to contribute immensely to the overall development of the third tier of government in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Asipa stated that the forum was of the opinion that the choice of Prince Ned Nwoko as a Grand Patron of the association would further enhance their resolve to reposition local government administration in Nigeria for good; “taking into cognizance, your unrelenting effort in the years past to get a share of the Paris refund to the coffers of local government councils across the nation.</p>
      <p>“This particular feat and other factors culminated in today’s Award of Excellent Service to Humanity and investiture as ASELGON Grand patron.”</p>
      <p>Also speaking, the National Organising Secretary of ASELGON, Hon. Abayomi Tella revealed that the name of Prince Ned Nwoko came up, when they had their NEC meeting in Abuja.</p>
      <p>“We discussed who could be our Grand Patron and we went into the internet and saw the name of Prince Ned Nwoko. We discovered that he sponsored about 20 bills as a member of the Federal House of Representatives within four years.</p>
      <p>“You will not only serve the people of Delta State, you will serve the whole Nigeria, where all of us would benefit.</p>
      <p>“We would want the Grand Patron to take us as partners in the development of Nigeria, and Africa as a whole and support us to deal with all our challenges,” he said.</p>
      <p>The investiture was attended by former local government chairmen across the 36 states of the federation representing the 774 local governments of Nigeria.</p>
