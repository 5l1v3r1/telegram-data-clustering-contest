      <p>An 82-year-old female bodybuilder fought back against a man who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">broke into her home</a> on Thursday night as she was getting ready for bed, using her daily workout regimen and various household items to overwhelm the intruder.</p>
      <p>Willie Murphy, who attends the Maplewood YMCA in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">Rochester, N.Y</a>., on a daily basis, was getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m. when a man started banging on the door asking for an ambulance, while declaring "I'm sick, I'm sick."</p>
      <p>Murphy called the police and wouldn't let him inside, which she says angered the man.</p>

      <p>“I hear a loud noise,” she told <a href="https://13wham.com/news/local/he-picked-the-wrong-house-82-year-old-beats-up-break-in-suspect">WHAM-TV</a>. “I’m thinking, what the heck was that? The young man is in my home. He broke the door.”</p>
      <p>The award-winning bodybuilder told the outlet she hid under the cover of night – picking up the nearest object – as the thief crept through her home.</p>
      <p>“I picked up the table, and I went to work on him,” said Murphy, who can deadlift 225 pounds. "The table broke.”</p>
      <p>“And when he’s down,” she added, “I’m jumping on him.”</p>
      <p>After the table drop, Murphy grabbed a nearby bottle of shampoo and went to town.</p>

      <p>“I grabbed the shampoo,” she told WHAM-TV. “Guess what? He’s still on the ground. In his face, all of it, the whole thing.”</p>

      <p>Shen then grabbed a nearby broom and swept the floor with the unknown suspect.</p>
      <p>“I got the broom,” she said. “He’s pulling the broom. I’m hitting him with the broom.”</p>
      <p>When officers arrived, Murphy says the first responders wanted to take selfies with her and she even received a hero's welcome when returning to her local YMCA.</p>
