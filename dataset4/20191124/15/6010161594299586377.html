      <h1>Video game sales to be just shy of $150 billion in 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:41:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">Cian Maher</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year it was announced that global video game sales would amount to over $150 billion in revenue by the end of 2019. That figure has recently been amended.</p>
      <p>The announcement came from <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-global-games-market-will-generate-152-1-billion-in-2019-as-the-u-s-overtakes-china-as-the-biggest-market/">Newzoo</a>, who conducted an investigative report into global video game sales back in June. Initially it was thought that games would make $152.1 billion, indicating a 9.6% increase from last year’s total revenue.</p>
      <p>It was originally estimated that the US would overtake China as the largest games market in the world — mostly due to the licensing freeze in China and attempts to reduce the amount of time kids spend playing games — but this didn’t end up happening. The report also estimated that console gaming would become the fastest-growing sector of the overall market, with PC being the smallest but still the most innovative and influential. A lot to take in.</p>
      <p>The revised <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoo-adjusts-global-games-forecast-to-148-8-billion-slower-growth-in-console-spending-starts-sooner-than-expected/">report</a> introduces an adjusted rate of $148.8 billion. It’s easy to see the figures 148 and 152 and not see a huge disparity between them, but it’s important to recognize that this is $3.3 billion.  Billion as in nine zeros. You can spend a week at the International Space Station for $50 million. So you could spend 66 weeks up there for $3.3 billion. Over a year in space. That’s the scale of this disparity.</p>

      <p>Still, the report was close, and the revised one has a lot more data to work with given that it was published towards the end of 2019 Q4. It also affirms that the games industry is currently in a healthy state, as indicated by how well <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/23/call-duty-modern-warfare-apex-legends-october-digital/">games like Call of Duty and Apex Legends sold in October</a>.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to state that video game sales should increase to about $189 billion per year by 2022. Console and mobile gaming are estimated to account for about 80% of this. Global revenue is increasing at a sufficiently exponential rate to assume that games will generate over $200 billion in revenue before long. Still pittance when compared to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/12/tencent-targets-western-gamers-nintendo-partnership/">Tencent’s half a trillion</a>.</p>
