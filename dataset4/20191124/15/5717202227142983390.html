        <b>A number of Newcastle United fans have implored the Magpies to make sure that they land Jarrod Bowen in January after he bagged a brace to help Hull come from 2-o down to draw with Middlesbrough.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/">The Sunday Mirror (24/11; page 72) reports</a> that Newcastle boss Steve Bruce wants to sign Bowen. However, the Premier League side could delay a move for the 22-year-old until next summer.</p>

      <p>Given Bowen’s form this season, supporters would have been forgiven for being frustrated by the reports. Bowen went into the weekend having scored nine goals in 16 league appearances for Hull this season.</p>
      <p>And it appears that his latest performance has left the Toon Army feeling even more impatient. But for some time, it seemed that Hull were about to suffer a defeat against struggling Boro.</p>

      <p>Jonathan Woodgate’s men were 2-0 up inside 26 minutes at the Riverside Stadium. But Marvin Johnson’s red card for the home side seemed to open the door for a potential fightback.</p>
      <p>And it was Bowen who made the most of the opportunity. The youngster scored twice in four minutes during the latter stages of the contest to secure a share of the points. The first goal in particular saw the former Hereford man produce a stunning strike from distance</p>
      <p>The brace has taken Bowen into joint-second in the Championship goalscoring charts. Only Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored more goals this season.</p>
      <p>And it has also prompted a number of Newcastle fans insist that Bruce needs to make sure that he signs the forward in the coming window. They believe that he could be a special talent, and the supporters are clearly worried that another club could make a move if the Magpies dawdle.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the Newcastle fans were saying after Bowen’s brace…</p>
