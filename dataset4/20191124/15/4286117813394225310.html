      <p>A policeman in plain clothes was caught by NCP leaders inside Hotel Renaissance in Mumbai. The argument took place on the allegations that the police officer was spying on the leaders and passing information to the BJP.</p>
      <p>This may also be the reason for shifting the NCP MLAs to another hotel. Jitendra Awhad, NCP MLA, claimed that police wonâ€™t do any such things unless and until they are instructed by those who are in government.</p>

      <p>This comes after Congress leader Ashok Chavan alleged that the BJP is trying to contact the party MLAs.</p>
      <p>Ashok Chavan on Sunday alleged that BJP leaders had booked rooms in hotels where his party MLAs are put up and were contacting some of them.</p>
      <p>Speculation was rife that the task of getting MLAs into the BJP's fold has been entrusted to senior leader Radhkrishna Vikhe Patil, who had crossed over from the Congress to the BJP ahead of the October Assembly polls, Sainik-turned-Congressman-turned BJP Rajya Sabha MP Narayan Rane, NCP-turned-BJP MLA Ganesh Naik and Babanrao Pachpute.</p>
      <p>When asked about the speculation, Vikhe Patil gave a cryptic and open-to-interpretation reply, stating "I have good relations with all MLAs".</p>
      <p>Chavan told reporters that some Congress MLAs had told him about the move by the BJP.</p>
