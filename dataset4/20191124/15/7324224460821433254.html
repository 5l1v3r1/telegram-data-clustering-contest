      <h1>Wolves Fans' Verdict v Bournemouth: Joao Moutinho is magical</h1>
      <h2>Our Wolves supporters share their thoughts on the 2-1 victory at Bournemouth that made it eight unbeaten in the Premier League.</h2>

        <b>Reaction to the Result</b>
      </p>
      <p>Going to Bournemouth and coming away with three points is no mean feat but it wasn’t even Wolves’ biggest result of the day after the news broke that Moutinho had signed a new deal with the club. Wolves were brilliant in the first half, moving the ball with purpose and showing signs of ruthlessness in front of goal. A completely dominant first half was followed by a pretty average second half in which Wolves made things difficult for themselves. However, it didn’t matter as the first half performance took the sting out of the game. Fifth in the league and showing no signs of stopping. What a time to be a Wolves fan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joao Moutinho was my man of the match and you can bet he intended to shoot with the free kick. That goal and his quick thinking for the second just sums up how good this man actually is. The greatest to ever wear the shirt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Something to Improve</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wolves have been guilty of taking their foot off the gas a little when they’ve taken the lead and the same happened at Bournemouth. They could make things a lot more easier! Apart from that, no complaints from me.</p>

      <p>The first half was as good a first half we have played this season, even better than against Villa. Our passing was crisp and accurate and we thoroughly deserved our 2-0 lead. Ironic the goals should come from two terrific set pieces when our open play was so impressive.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>Traore was virtually unplayable in the opening half, looking a goal threat every time he had the ball. Coady was hugely impressive throughout at the back. Our superiority though stemmed from our dynamic duo in midfield. Both Neves and Moutinho looked on top of their game, the latter just gets the MOTM award for his contribution in the two goals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Something to Improve</b>
      </p>
      <p>Picking any faults would be harsh. Jota looks like he needs a goal from all his hard work and there were a few tired bodies in the last twenty minutes.</p>

      <p>I’m thrilled with the away win that keeps the unbeaten run going, and now we're turning those draws into victories. I’m always wary of the first game after an international break, but we’ve now put that one to rest. How the likes of Jimenez and Moutinho can keep going and playing so many games I do not know. They were both instrumental again in this game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve got to say, news of Moutinho‘s new contract eclipsed anything we have done this season, for me. The best Wolves player in my lifetime, for sure. He likes the vino and so did I last night! Yet another Man of the Match performance from him. He scored a superb free kick and then placed a precision pass to Traore, which split their defence, enabling yet another assist for Jimenez to slot home with his left foot. Traore was excellent, again. Also Coady, Saiss and Jota were in great form.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Something to Improve</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s harsh to be critical. The performance overall was good. The first half was possibly our best of the season. We were deservedly 2-0 up at half time. The second half was harder than it should have been; often the case when the opposition go down to 10 men. Our marking for their first corner was not good and resulted in their goal. We would have been desperately disappointed to come away with a draw and we have to thank Patricio for his save at the end.</p>

      <p>We haven’t won at Bournemouth for 80-odd years, we never win after an international break, we blah blah blah. Quite simply we put on our best first half performance for decades and hats off to the home side for keeping it to 2-0 at the break. Second half seemed to be played with Europe in mind on Thursday but an away win was no less than we deserved.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Man of the Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>Again, everyone, but the strangely-coiffured Adama Traore was yet again brilliant.</p>
      <p>

      <p>VAR which robbed us again but, otherwise, only the weather.</p>
