      <p>Storm Sebastien is moving north-east from the <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/4810398/irish-weather-forecast-met-eireann-warn-of-risk-of-flooding-next-week-as-storm-sebastiens-set-to-hit-country/">Atlantic</a> and is set to land in Ireland on Monday and continue into Tuesday, possibly bringing heavy rain and a risk of flooding.</p>
      <p>According to Alan O'Reilly of Carlow Weather, there is some uncertainty about the storm with some heavy rain on the cards.</p>
      <p>"The track of Sebastien or what is left of it after it merges with another low continues to cause weather models a headache.</p>
      <p>"A lot of uncertainty on charts for Tuesday but it should stay south of us keeping strongest winds offshore, risk of associated heavy rain though," he said.</p>
