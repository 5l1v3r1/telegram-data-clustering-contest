      <p><b>BATH, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - Authorities are investigating the death of a woman found unresponsive after her clothing apparently caught fire in a mobile home in eastern Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>The Northampton County coroner said 73-year-old Elizabeth Grube was found after police went to the Scotty's Manufactured Homes park for ages 55 and older to check on her at about 6:45 p.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>Coroner Zachary Lysek said Saturday he hadn't yet determined a cause or manner of death. He said an autopsy was scheduled but further tests would likely be needed.</p>
      <p>Lysek said Grube's clothing had apparently caught fire but didn't say whether that contributed to her death. The fire apparently hadn't spread to the home. The cause remains under investigation.</p>
