      <p>After keeping quiet on social media for seven months, she recently made a comeback to Instagram.</p>
      <p>Finding Her Voice is a 30-episode series and is one of TVB’s special anniversary series.</p>
      <p>It started airing on 7 October.</p>
      <p>Maid Alliance and Offliners, two series that feature Wong would be screened in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Wong was caught kissing Hong Kong actor and singer Andy Hui in a taxi but this ‘scandal’ died out.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the scandal, her boyfriend Kenneth Ma also broke up with her.</p>
      <p>As for Andy Hui, his wife Sammi Cheng forgave him for the act and also brought him to her concerts so that her fans can forgive him.</p>
      <p>In other news, <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/groove/2019/11/535720/showbiz-jacqueline-pregnant-and-preparing-childbirth">The News Straits Times </a>quoted China Post as saying that TVB actress Jacqueline Wong is rumoured to be pregnant and it is being circulated in Chinese social media channels.</p>
