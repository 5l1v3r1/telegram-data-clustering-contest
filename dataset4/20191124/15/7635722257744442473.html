        <b>A charity working to save koalas from raging bushfires in Australia has raised €900,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The country has been hit by a devastating early bushfire season this year with huge fires burning through several states.</p>
      <p>New South Wales has been hardest hit with more than 1.65m hectares burnt and six lives lost.</p>
      <p>This morning there were more than 60 fires burning across the state.</p>
      <p>The fires have claimed homes and businesses across the country and have had a devastating impact on wildlife in certain areas.</p>

      <p>The koala was already struggling before this year’s fire season took hold – with Australian Koala Foundation warning back in May that the animals were “functionally extinct.”</p>
      <p>It said their numbers had fallen so low that they were unlikely to produce a new generation.</p>
      <p>Their numbers are hard to track as they are highly nomadic and live in many different habitats; however, experts generally agree that they are in steep decline.</p>

      <p>In a call for funding, the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital (PMKH) warned that around 75% of the land devastated by this year’s fires is prime koala habitat.</p>
      <p>At least 1,000 are thought to have died in the fires.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-thirsty-koalas-devastated-by-recent-fires">The funding page</a></b> was originally set up in a bid to raise AU$25,000 to treat injured koalas at the hospital.</p>
      <p>It has now raised AU$1,462,290 (€900,638).</p>

      <p>The extra money is being used to extend a koala drinking station project across New South Wales and to establish a wild koala breeding program.</p>
      <p>The programme would see large swathes of koala habitat protected from development to allow the animals the space and safety to breed.</p>
