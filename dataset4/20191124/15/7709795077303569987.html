        <b>Chris's Dream justified market confidence as he ran out a stylish winner of the Ladbrokes Troytown Handicap Chase at Navan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trained by Henry de Bromhead, Chris's Dream was given a peach of a ride by Robbie Power, settling off the pace through the early stages before delivering a perfectly-timed challenge to grab the 59,000 euros first prize.</p>
      <p>Last year's second Mr Diablo was prominent throughout much of the three-mile trip, but they were lining up to challenge him with three fences to jump.</p>
      <p>Chris's Dream (9-2) was making effortless progress in behind, seizing control at the second-last as Fitzhenry tried to go with him.</p>
      <p>When Power gave the signal coming to the last, the favourite stretched clear and soared over the final obstacle to pull nine and a half lengths clear at the line.</p>
      <p>Fitzhenry kept on for second, with Portmore Lough a further seven and a half lengths back in third and Space Cadet fourth.</p>

      <p>Chris's Dream was a Grade Two winner over course and distance back in February, but he fell short at Grade One level at Aintree and Punchestown.</p>
      <p>De Bromhead said: "Brian (Acheson, owner) suggested this race, and it made a lot of sense. Robbie was brilliant on him, and he's a very good horse.</p>
      <p>"His form tailed off a bit last season, so we'll have to watch that, and it seems he doesn't want too much racing. We went to Aintree full of confidence, and he was well beaten - then he ran no sort of race at Punchestown.</p>
      <p>"Christmas will probably come too soon, so maybe we will look at something like the Thyestes -but to be honest, I haven't really looked beyond today."</p>
