      <h1>Next Premier League manager sacked: Rating which boss is most likely to go first</h1>
      <h2>Poor results for Arsenal, Everton and West Ham have seen yet more pressure heaped on the shoulders of their bosses this weekend, but which of the managers will be axed first?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:23:34+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Rarely have there been so many managers hovering nervously in the Premier League bosses' departure lounge.</p>
      <p>The weekend's results have only served to heap more pressure on a number of beleaguered managers up and down the country, with the powers-that-be in top-flight boardrooms all pondering whether or not this is the right time to pull the trigger.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> were booed off at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> after a sixth successive game without a win, as not even Alexandre Lacazette's last-gasp equaliser could ease the pressure on Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in London, Manuel Pellegrini cut a forlorn figure as new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss Jose Mourinho led his side to a victory over the Chilean's stuttering Hammers.</p>

      <p>While up on Merseyside there were chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> fans at Goodison Park as Marco Silva's Blues lost at home to a Norwich side who had began the day on the foot of the table.</p>
      <p>There are other bosses who have hovered near the brink of the sack this season - Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl and the returning <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> boss Quique Sanchez Flores immediately spring to mind - while some feel that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> should get rid of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer now Mauricio Pochettino is available.</p>

      <p>But it is the hotseats at the Emirates, the London Stadium and Goodison Park which look the hottest right now, so who'll go first?</p>
      <p>Let's take a look.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal - Unai Emery</h3>

      <p>
        <b>What's happened?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners are on their worst run of form for over 20 years, and Emery has seen his side lose touch with the top four as a result.</p>
      <p>With his communication skills coming under scrutiny, the Spaniard is quickly losing support among the fanbase.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who could replace him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plenty would love to see a North London switch for Pochettino, but current assistant Freddie Ljungberg and stalwart Steve Bould are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-line-up-unai-emery-20949654">a more likely choice until the end of the season</a> , before another move for Mikel Arteta in the summer.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Will he be the next PL boss sacked?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal's next five games - Eintracht Frankfurt, Norwich, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and Standard Liege - are pretty winnable, and so decent results there would mean they might hold off on pressing the button just yet.</p>
      <h3>West Ham - Manuel Pellegrini</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>What's happened?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hammers went fifth in the table when they beat Manchester United 2-0 on September 22, but they've since gone winless in seven Premier League games, losing five, and been hammered 4-0 by Oxford in the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>The Chilean's side were horribly exposed by Mourinho's Tottenham for the majority of Saturday's 3-2 loss, and faith in the ex-Manchester City boss is running out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who could replace him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hammers would surely love to tempt Rafael Benitez back to the Premier League, while Chris Hughton would be a decent option as a firefighter.</p>
      <p>While if they're ambitious, then Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder would also be a great appointment.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Will he be the next PL boss sacked?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hammers have a tough run coming up, but any decision on sacking Pellegrini surely has to be taken with who the replacement will be in mind, and they could have a tough time getting hold of one.</p>
      <h3>Everton - Marco Silva</h3>

      <p>
        <b>What's happened?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's more about what hasn't happened.</p>
      <p>The vast amounts of money spent by the Blues was supposed to get them in touch with the Premier League elite but it just hasn't. Silva also seems to have lost the majority of the fans, and there doesn't look to be a way back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who could replace him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pochettino is out of their reach, Arteta is likely to wait for Arsenal and other options don't seem that inspiring, so a David Moyes return until the end of the season looks likely.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Will he be the next PL boss sacked?</b>
      </p>
      <p>He probably will be.</p>
      <p>Silva is the odds-on favourite to go, and with a nightmare fixture list on the horizon then Blues chiefs look likely to wield the axe now.</p>
