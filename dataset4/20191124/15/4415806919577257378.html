      <h1>Photographer Pat Healy hospitalised after horse crashes through railing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:37:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Photographer Pat Healy was taken to hospital following a nasty incident after the line in the opening race at Navan.</p>
      <p>Thatsy and Entoucas fought out a thrilling finish to the www.navanracecourse.ie Maiden Hurdle, with the pair coming close together on the run to the line after negotiating the final hurdle.</p>
      <p>While Thatsy just edged in front to win, Entoucas appeared to crash through the inside railing just after the post – colliding with the photographer, who was stationed nearby.</p>
      <p>He was quickly tended to by medical staff – and while he was reported to be conscious, he was taken to Blanchardstown Hospital by ambulance for further examination, causing a delay to the following ‘Monksfield’ Novice Hurdle.</p>
      <p>The doctor on duty at the track, Frank Kenny, said: “He left the course very stable and has injuries to the right side of his chest.”</p>
      <p>Entoucas and rider Mark Walsh escaped serious injury, with the jockey reporting his mount had dived at the gap in the railing just after the line.</p>
