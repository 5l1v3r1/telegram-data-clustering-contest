      <p>Kanye West has bought another pricey ranch in Wyoming – under 100 miles away from the $US14 million Monster Lake Ranch <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/kanye-west-wyoming-ranch-photos-2019-9">he already purchased a few months ago</a>.</p>
      <p>TMZ reported on November 18 that <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/kanye-west-buys-14-million-wyoming-ranch-bighorn-mountain/">the rapper spent $US14.495 million on a 6,713-acre ranch</a> known as Bighorn Mountain Ranch.</p>
      <p>In addition to the ranch, <a href="https://people.com/home/kanye-west-buys-another-wyoming-ranch-giant-warehouse/">PEOPLE reports that West</a> also bought a warehouse in Cody.</p>
      <p>It is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-wyoming-ranches-land-real-estate-plans-2019-11">unclear what the rapper is trying to do with all of these properties</a>, but he had announced plans to build an amphitheater on Monster Lake Ranch before he was denied the permit, <a href="https://apnews.com/12898b781fba43e093530b5e01f3af4e">the Associated Press reported on Wednesday.</a></p>
      <p>A representative for West did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-wyoming-ranches-land-real-estate-plans-2019-11">Business Insider’s previous request for comment</a> regarding the second ranch purchase.</p>
      <p>Here’s a peek inside West’s new Wyoming ranch.</p>

      <p>“I see us living on a ranch in Wyoming, occasionally going to Palm Springs and our home in Los Angeles – and becoming a lawyer,” <a href="https://en.vogue.me/culture/kanye-west-interviews-kim-kardashian-west/">Kardashian West said</a> when her husband asked how she sees herself in 10 years’ time.</p>

      <h3>But what is the “Jesus is King” rapper intending to do with all these Wyoming properties? Business Insider previously reported on West’s recent ranch-buying trend.</h3>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://people.com/home/kanye-west-wants-14-million-wyoming-ranch-to-be-a-home-for-his-spiritual-services-source/">PEOPLE</a> that West wants Bighorn to be the permanent venue for his Sunday Services, a pop-up church service.</p>
      <p>On the larger ranch real-estate trend, Business Insider’s Libertina Brandt cited <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/baby-boomers-are-leaving-behind-a-trail-of-luxury-ranches-11566487531">a Wall Street Journal report</a> which notes that luxury ranches have become less appealing to younger generations, citing the labour and money which must be spent to operate and maintain the massive proprieties.</p>
      <p>As a result, there’s a surplus of luxury ranches – at least, that is, until West buys them all up.</p>
