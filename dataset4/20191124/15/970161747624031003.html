      <p>Aleksandr the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2014/12/25/compare-the-meerkat-baby-oleg-leaves-the-ad-series-4999584/">Meerkat</a>, watch your back: there’s a new anthropomorphised corporate mascot in town, and he’s coming to snatch the hearts of the British public. And, indeed, your wig!</p>
      <p>Aldi’s mascot <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/kevin-the-carrot-aldi-christmas-advert-2019-11046782/">Kevin the Carrot</a> has become a festive stalwart since his debut in 2016, with this year’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/peaky-blinders/">Peaky Blinders</a>-inspired advert being declared the <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/aldi-most-effective-christmas-ad-2019/">most successful</a> Christmas ad of the season. John Lewis, your <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/john-lewis-christmas-2019-edgar-dragon-11088313/">baby dragon</a> took one hell of a beating!</p>
      <p>Now, for the third year running, you can purchase a furry toy of Kevin the Carrot’s likeness, along with his wife Katie and three children – just in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>But you better get in fast: in 2018, the toys were in such high demand that they sold out and ended up on Ebay for as much as £1000 – despite the fact they only retailed at £2.99. Buying yourself a cuddly carrot could be a sound financial investment.</p>

      <p>After all, who among us couldn’t do with a cheeky extra grand at this time of year?</p>
      <p>But, in an effort to stop unscrupulous toy barons buying up all the stock to resell them on Ebay, Aldi have limited purchases to two items per customer, so it might not work as a get-rich-quick scheme.</p>

      <p>As well as normal-size toys, which are on sale for £3.99, you can buy an absurdly giant one for £19.99, which stands at one metre tall, and one of Kevin’s arch-nemesis, the evil Pascal the Parsnip.</p>
      <p>But it’s worth saying that this guy Pascal is seriously twisted: in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/08/aldi-christmas-advert-sees-kevin-the-carrot-go-head-to-head-with-brand-new-enemy-pascal-the-parsnip-8116216/">2018 Aldi advert</a>, he actually plans to murder and <i>eat </i>both Kevin and his little carrot children.</p>
      <p>Given that Pascal is a vegetable himself, this is barely a notch away from cannibalism. It’s monstrous, and completely unforgivable, behaviour.</p>
      <p>Do you really want to bring such bad vibes into your home during the season of goodwill?</p>

      <p>Villainous parsnips aside, if you’ve been reading up to this point and thinking, ‘yes, yes, all of this sounds great — but I’m Scottish, so what about <i>me</i>?’ then you’re in luck — because there’s also a Kevin the Carrot who wears a kilt.</p>
      <p>This special edition raises money for Kiltwalk, a Scottish charity which supports a wide range of causes, and comes in either size. As for the question of whether or not Kevin is a ‘true Scotsman’, we can only speculate.</p>

      <p>The toys can be purchased in stores from Thursday 28 November from 8am, but you can also preorder them online on <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/">Aldi’s website</a> from 24 November.</p>
