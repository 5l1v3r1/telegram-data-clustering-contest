      <h1>REPORT: Colin Kaepernick Has Received ‘Absolutely Zero’ Interest from Teams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:58:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Last Saturday, Colin Kaepernick showed off elite arm strength during his public workout in front of seven or eight NFL team reps, but that doesn’t seem to matter, because he has reportedly received “zero” interest from NFL teams.</p>
      <blockquote>“Zero. Absolutely zero. The workout last week did absolutely nothing to enhance the chances that Colin Kaepernick is going to wind up with another team,” <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28149508/sources-nfl-teams-called-colin-kaepernick-qb-nov-16-workout">ESPN’s Adam Schefter</a> said Sunday on SportsCenter. “There hasn’t been a team that has requested a workout. There hasn’t been a team that has requested a visit. There hasn’t been a team that has expressed interest in signing him. So, despite the fact that one week ago we saw Colin Kaepernick work out at the high school down in the Atlanta area, it has not translated into any results, and though the league wanted to try to help out, at least said it was trying to help out, nothing’s come of it. Colin Kaepernick’s wait continues and it looks like it’s going to be continuing for a very, very, very long time.”</blockquote>
      <p>The workout was streamed live for all to watch, but after Kaepernick and his team changed venues at the last minute because both sides could not come to terms on details of a tryout that was scheduled for the Atlanta Falcons’ facility.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old has sent the tape to all teams in the league, yet nobody seems to be interested in his services.</p>
      <p>Following his workout, Kaepernick delivered a message.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready for three years,” Kaepernick said. “I’ve been denied for three years. We all know why I came out here. [I] showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. So we’re waiting for the 32 owners, 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running. Stop running from the truth. Stop running from the people.”</p>
