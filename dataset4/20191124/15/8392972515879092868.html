      <p>Adventurer <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/bear-grylls-reveals-struggle-with-anxiety/">Bear Grylls</a> is used to tough times out in the wild - but the broadcaster may not be used to being on the receiving end of such a torrid time indoors, as he did from some BBC viewers last night.</p>
      <p>The host of Running Wild and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/bear-grylls-treasure-island-fans-shocked-as-contestant-drinks-own-wee/">The Island</a>, 45, appeared on Michael McIntrye's Big Show and viewers immediately picked up on the new moustache he was sporting.</p>
      <p>Bear, who's about film a new series for Netflix, played Michael's infamous Send To All mobile phone game.</p>
      <p>"Handing me their mobile phone is just about the bravest thing a celebrity can do, so why not play it with the bravest celebrity of them all," Michael said.</p>

      <p>Sitting along Bear in the box was his wife, Shara, and friends Verity and Lilly.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before viewers took to Twitter to mock the appendage.</p>
      <aside>Have the Village People reformed?</aside>
      <p>One viewer joked: "Bear Grylls looking like he's trying out for a role as a boiler fixer in a B-movie porno with that moustache."</p>

      <p>He was also interviewed on Friday on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a>, and chatted to hosts Ben Shepherd and Charlotte Hawkins - and they also remarked on Bear's new facial fuzz.</p>
      <p>"I find myself in a situation when I apologise before they even say anything," Bear laughed, sensing that they were going to say something.</p>
      <p>However, he revealed that he won't be keeping the 'tache - and admitted his wife hates it and that he'll shave it off before his next bout of filming.</p>
