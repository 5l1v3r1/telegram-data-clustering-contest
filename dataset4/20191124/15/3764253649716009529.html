      <p><i>“We are also interested in the roles played by two banks in the country including one that has been on our radar for a while for money laundering. This same bank was implicated in the $115 million poll bribery scam in 2015 for which former Minister of Petroleum Resources Diezani Alison-Madueke is wanted for trial,”</i> the source said.</p>
      <p>EFCC, as relayed by the sources close to the media platform, would also probe the money inflows into various accounts of non-governmental organisations that are backed by the Air Peace boss.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Upon the receipt of the charges, the EFCC chairman raised a team to probe the allegations against Onyema Eghagha, who were prominently mentioned in the indictment charges by the United States Government.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The EFCC team is working on what I may term the ‘Nigerian components’ of the indictment including suspicious huge transfer of funds abroad, alleged abuse of letters of credit and money laundering,”</i> the source said.</p>
