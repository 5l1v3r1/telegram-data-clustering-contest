      <h1>Ryan Reynolds Crashed Will Ferrell's 'Saturday Night Live' Monologue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:03:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author">Kayleigh Roberts</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>Last night, Will Ferrell hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a> for the fifth time in his career.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>In spite of his ample experience on the <i>SNL</i> stage, both as a five-time host and as a former cast member, Ferrell was thrown off his game by <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29823223/mariah-carey-hung-out-with-blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, who made a surprise appearance in the audience at the taping, leaving the comedian starstruck.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Another former <i>SNL</i> cast member, Tracy Morgan, eventually had to step in to save the day and restore Ferrell's confidence so he could finish his monologue.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>Last night was a big milestone for Will Ferrell. The comedian officially joined the ultra-exclusive <i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a28839773/leslie-jones-leaving-saturday-night-live/">Saturday Night Live</a></i> Five-Timers Club (as in the people who have hosted the show at least five times). It will also forever be known as "The Night <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a28809286/ryan-reynolds-unflattering-pictures-of-blake-lively-birthday/">Ryan Reynolds</a> Threw Will Ferrell Completely Off His Game."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a23521867/ryan-reynolds-trolled-blake-lively-simple-favor-photo-shoot/">Reynolds crashed</a> the taping of the show and his mere presence in the audience was enough to dominate Ferrell's opening monologue as the host fought his starstruck awkwardness to deliver his speech.</p>
      <p>Ferrell began his monologue by having the audience join him in celebrating his Fiver-Timers Club membership and gushing about how much his time as a member of the <i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g12501691/famous-snl-cast-members/">SNL </a></i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g12501691/famous-snl-cast-members/">cast</a> meant to him. Then, well, Ryan Reynolds happened.</p>

      <p>"I’m sorry, one second, excuse me, but you look a lot like Ryan Reynolds," he said to an audience member, who was, of course, actually <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29573212/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-instagram-trolling-2019/">Ryan Reynolds</a>.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I get that a lot," the actor replied.</p>
      <p>From there, Ferrell devolved into fanboy status (which we cannot blame him for at all):</p>
      <blockquote>Ferrell: "Is it you?"</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Reynolds: "Yes, it’s me."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Ferrell: "Oh, oh wow OK, cool, welcome to the show."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Reynolds: "Thank you, I'm a big fan."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Ferrell: "A big fan of me? Oh, OK. Fine. I didn't know you were gonna be here, OK...I can't believe you're here."</blockquote>
      <p>Ferrell then asked the most obvious question—if Reynolds' wife, Blake Lively, was also a fan.</p>
      <p>"And she likes me too?" Ferrell asked.</p>
      <p>"Probably more than me," Reynolds replied, prompting a bout of nervous laughter from the host.</p>
      <p>Ferrell was unable to focus on his monologue with Reynolds in the audience and eventually another former <i>SNL</i> cast member, Tracy Morgan, had to step in to save the day.</p>
      <p>"Ryan Reynolds, you listen to me!" Morgan said. "The prophecy must be fulfilled! This is Will Ferrell! I suckled from his comedy bosom, and like a young Luke Skywalker, it filled me with strength!"</p>
      <p>Ferrell did eventually finish his monologue and Reynolds stuck around for the show, even putting in an appearance on Weekend Update, alongside <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a14449329/scarlett-johansson-returns-to-snl-as-ivanka-trump-just-in-time-for-the-holidays/">Colin Jost, who got engaged</a> to Reynolds' ex-wife, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a25191/scarlett-johansson-march-2017-cover/">Scarlett Johansson</a>, earlier this year.</p>
