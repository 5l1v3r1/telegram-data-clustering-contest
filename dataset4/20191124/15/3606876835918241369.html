      <h1>Daniel Craig Confirms No Time to Die Will Be His Last Movie Playing James Bond</h1>

        <b>Daniel Craig has confirmed that the next movie in the James Bond franchise, <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29697313/daniel-craig-phoebe-waller-bridge-sexist-question-diversity-hire/">No Time to Die </a>, will be his final film playing the famous spy. During a recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, when asked if he was finished with the series, Craig offered a resolute "Yes," adding: "It's done."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, Craig has previously hinted that he might be done with the character; while doing press for Spectre in 2015, he said that he would rather "slash [his] wrists" than do another Bond movie. He later clarified that he made the comments just days after coming off a lengthy shoot for Spectre and he was feeling completely exhausted by the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28055505/daniel-craig-workout-bond-injury/">rigorous training </a>required of the role. He later managed to <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a19530419/daniel-craig-james-bond-confirms-return/">muster up the enthusiasm </a>to do one more, No Time to Die, which comes out on April 3, 2020.</p>
      <p>"I've had a really good run, and I think doing this movie was the right thing to do," Craig told <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/11/23/no-time-die-daniel-craigs-last-bond-role-actor-says/4283095002/">USA Today </a>this week. "It was the right thing to do one more."</p>
      <p>Craig first took on the tailored suit of 007 in Casino Royale, a movie which functioned as a soft reboot of the franchise after a handful of sillier entries in the '90s and early '00s (all due respect to Pierce Brosnan). He has since starred in Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre, and No Time to Die marks his fifth adventure as James Bond.</p>
      <p>Speculation that Craig would be departing the franchise has been rife for some time now, with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a19547856/why-idris-elba-should-be-the-next-james-bond/">Idris Elba </a>and <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29726268/henry-golding-james-bond-rumors/">Henry Golding </a>both rumored to be next in line to play Bond. Whomever takes on the role next, they have some pretty big shoes to fill: Craig has become many film fans' definitive Bond.</p>
