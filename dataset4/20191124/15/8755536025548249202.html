      <p>For this week’s Spotlight On feature we’re chatting to Caitlín Ní Dochartaigh, a Depop shop owner who is making her mark on the Irish sustainable fashion industry.</p>
      <p>The Sligo native is one of the many people across the world who is making a living from the app, which was founded in 2011.</p>
      <p>With one third of our wardrobes estimated to be made up of second-hand clothing by 2033, according to a recent ThredUP report, innovators like Caitlín are set to go from strength to strength.</p>

      <p><b>1. Tell us a little bit about your self?<br/></b>So my name is Caitlín, I’m 23 and I’m originally from Sligo but have lived in Dublin for almost 4 years now.  I’m a final year fine art student in TUD and I love working with textiles and ceramics. I’ve loved fashion for years, my personal style is a bit all over the place and changes constantly but at the moment I would say it is between sporty spice and a kind of gothic bratz doll.</p>
      <p><b>2. What does sustainability mean to you?<br/></b>Sustainability for me, particularly in fashion means considering the ethical and environmental impact of clothing when I am buying and selling.</p>

      <p><b>3. How does that incorporate into your passion for selling second hand and vintage clothing? <br/></b>I’ve always loved shopping secondhand, before I had fully considered the impact that clothes have on the planet so when I began to learn about sustainable fashion it really solidified my love of vintage and definitely made me more passionate about the benefits of shopping secondhand.<br/>Nearly 60% of clothes are incinerated or end up in landfill a year after being made, so it’s super important to make the most of the clothes that we already have.Every single item of clothing has an impact on our environment and through my own choices as a seller I can determine the scale of that impact whether it’s through sourcing secondhand or upcycling my old bits that haven’t sold, there’s so many fun ways to get creative with clothes. I never throw anything away I always incorporate it either into my own wardrobe or Depop to elongate the life of the item.</p>

      <p><b>4. What made you start a Depop? Can you tell us about your Depop from beginning to now? <br/></b>I never intended to sell as much as I do now, I’m a bit of a shopaholic, and originally started my Depop to clear out my wardrobe about 3 years ago. I’ve shopped secondhand from a young age, so most of my items were unique, vintage stuff that I had picked up in charity shops. It went quite organically from there, as my Depop grew I started picking up amazing vintage bits abroad at markets while on holidays and built up my stock as I went along!</p>
      <p><b>5. How do you source the clothing for Sugar and Spice vintage? <br/></b>I handpick the majority of my stock from markets around Europe, but still pick up the occasional piece here and there in Ireland. I usually combine the trips with a holiday and go to a different place each time. I went to Italy two weeks ago and got the most amazing vintage corsets and handbags there! The vintage is always so different in each place, which I love because it means my stock has a great variety.</p>

      <p><b>6. What are your thoughts on the increase in sustainable markets and events in Dublin recently? <br/></b>There’s been so many incredible events popping up recently it’s amazing, it’s so lovely to see increasing interest in vintage fashion and sustainability. I’ve sold at three markets in the last two weeks and have a few coming up before Christmas that I’m really looking forward too. There’s always such a great buzz at them! Everyone is always so friendly, it’s a really great way to meet people with similar interests too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. How has sustainability impacted your personal style?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shopping sustainably really helped me to explore and curate my fashion sense. With fast fashion I could just buy a full, trendy outfit from Instagram or a manikin, but with secondhand you really have to hunt for items. Trends usually aren’t readily available so I have to be more creative with you style, making it much more personal. I also love reworking and upcycling my clothes it gives me  much more freedom to experiment!</p>

        <b>8. What are your plans for the future?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love the freedom and flexibility that comes with selling online, and Depop is my first love so I definitely want to focus on building up my page and sharing my passion for vintage with people!</p>
      <p>I’m also really excited about all of the events and markets that are happening and definitely want to explore them more as a participant and seller too.</p>
