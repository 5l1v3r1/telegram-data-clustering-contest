        <b>Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua was on Sunday, November 24, handpicked for a special award by president Uhuru Kenyatta at State House Nairobi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Head of State awarded the governor when he hosted scouts from across the country for the 2019 annual <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46780-uhurus-hosts-exclusive-state-house-ceremony-his-club">Kenya Scouts Association Patron’s Day.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Kenyans.co.ke</i>, the governor expressed his pride and joy at being recognized by a club he had joined back when he was in class 3.</p>
      <p>"I joined this esteemed movement back in class three at Toi Primary School Kibra, I have been an active member ever since, leading to my current role as the scout's patron in Machakos.</p>

      <p>Uhuru presented awards to exemplary scouts as well as other state and non-state entities for their outstanding contribution to the <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46780-uhurus-hosts-exclusive-state-house-ceremony-his-club">growth of the scouting movement in Kenya.</a></p>
      <p>The audibly ecstatic Mutua went on to explain how virtues such as discipline instilled in him once he became a scout had helped mould his career.</p>
      <p>"I gained the discipline of being calm which is why I don't <i>tanga tanga</i> from my position haphazardly. I urge all parents, if they can, to get their children into the scout's movement because it will give them the strength of purpose," he stated.</p>
      <p>He went on to reveal that plans were underway for a <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46780-uhurus-hosts-exclusive-state-house-ceremony-his-club">massive recruitment drive by the scouts' movement in his county</a>.</p>
      <p>Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya was also recognized for the resources his administration allocates annually to the scouting movement in his county.</p>
      <p>Uhuru while speaking at the event reiterated that the youth are the cornerstone of the future progress of the nation saying young Kenyans need to be equipped with the scouting principles of selfless service, trustworthiness, hard work, good citizenship and endurance.</p>
