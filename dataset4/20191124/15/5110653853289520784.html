      <p>Only one week remains in college football's regular season, yet we found out once again on Saturday that every game counts in the lead-up to the final set of College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>We saw that with <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/how-oregons-pac-12-loss-to-arizona-state-impacts-college-football-playoff-picture/2n1pipvtpezm18gljdbbj25kj">Oregon's 31-28 loss</a> to a .500 Arizona State team, and nearly saw it again when <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/oklahoma-tcu-controversial-first-down-call-refs/4uhdpzj15q061uef0lg05kc35">Oklahoma staved off an upset</a> from TCU thanks to a controversial spot by officials late in the game.</p>
