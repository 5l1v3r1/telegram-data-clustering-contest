      <p>Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley has been ‘tempted’ to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> ballroom.</p>
      <p>The 80s icon would be quite a signing for the show…if they can get him to change his mind.</p>
      <p>Andrew confessed that he ‘couldn’t take the leap’ in the end as his dancing feet aren’t quite up to scratch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/andrew-ridgeley-interview-george-michael-wham-and-redemption-2kf3g7vgq">In an interview with The Times</a>, he said: ‘I was tempted to do it. Really tempted.</p>
      <p>‘I think at that time I hadn’t had a public profile for a long time. I don’t think I was ready.’</p>
      <p>But it’s never say never for the 56-year-old, who added that he would ‘possibly’ get involved in a future series.</p>
      <p>Ridgeley found fame alongside the late George Michael in the band pop group Wham!, who were big in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the current series of Strictly is rolling on with the likes of Kelvin Fletcher, Saffron Barker, Karim Zeroual and Emma Barton taking part.</p>

      <p>George died on Christmas Day in 2016 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/03/07/george-michael-died-of-natural-causes-oxfordshire-coroner-confirms-6493548/">as a result of a dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver.</a></p>

      <p>However Andrew admitted in his autobiography <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/george-michaels-best-friend-wham-star-andrew-ridgeley-still-questions-singers-death-10858968/">that he still has questions</a> about how the star died.</p>
      <p>He claimed that George seemed to be in good health at the time and there are conflicting reports surrounding that night that preceded his passing’.</p>
      <p>Writing in his new autobiography, he added: ‘It now seems as if we may never know what really happened.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t like our lives being monitored, so when someone dies alone, perhaps there are always answers that remain out of reach.</p>
      <p>‘It still feels uncomfortable though. God knows what it must be like for George’s family.’</p>
