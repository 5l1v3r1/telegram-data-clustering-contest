      <h1>Joker Director Todd Phillips Knows His Film Is 'Not for Everybody'</h1>

      <p>After a relatively combative press tour with the media, writer/director Todd Phillips is now acknowledging the divisiveness of his film, <i>Joker</i>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/video/todd-phillips-joker-career-interview-behind-the-lens/">Deadline</a>, Phillips admitted that the film is "not for everyone" and intentionally so, stating, "That was one of the things I said to [Warner Bros.] in the beginning. Comic book films are generally PG-13, kind of aiming at four quadrant, so to speak, but we were very specific in that this is not necessarily a movie for everybody."</p>

      <p>He also explained that the darker tone of the film was in response to comic book films "taking over" the box office. "It’s hard to deny that comic book movies have kind of taken over, as far as the theatrical experience has gone," Phillips explained. "So I just thought, maybe there’s a way to use that, and do something a little bit different.”</p>

      <p><i>Joker </i>was met with more controversy pre-release than most movies, sparking fear that the film would incite real-life violence or present a sympathetic portrayal of mass shooters. Phillips and the film's star, Joaquin Phoenix, generally refused to discuss this at the time, but Phillips now admits that the film has an "unsettling tone."</p>
      <p>The film was ultimately released to generally positive reviews, awards buzz, and a far greater box-office performance than projected - becoming the highest grossing R-rated movie of all time. <a href="https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-sequel-story-must-happen/">Rumors of a sequel </a>or similar R-rated takes on DC villains are currently circulating.</p>
      <p>Directed by Todd Phillips, <i>Joker</i> stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. The film is now in theaters.</p>
