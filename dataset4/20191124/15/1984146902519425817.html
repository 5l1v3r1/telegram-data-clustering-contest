      <p>He added: "At about 6.30am this morning, there was a loud noise outside the house.</p>
      <p>"The missus woke us up to find out there was a car, in the garden opposite, on fire against a house.</p>
      <p>"I just ran to the house, trying to make sure they were all out and all right.</p>
      <p>"It was just adrenaline. When you see flames and you think people need rescued, you just run for it, you just do it.</p>
      <p>"The car was on fire. I phoned the fire brigade and police.</p>
      <p>"The flames were touching the roof of the house. The car was in some state."</p>
      <p>Another neighbour said: "We heard a loud bang and we looked out of the window to see what was happening.</p>
      <p>"There were people running across the road and there was a car on fire. It was quite a shock.</p>

      <p>"We rang the fire brigade. They came and put the fire out.</p>
      <p>"Luckily no-one in the house was hurt. We're glad everyone is ok. It could have been much worse."</p>
      <p>Police say the car veered off the road, crossed a garden in front of the property and then hit a wall.</p>
      <p>The force received reports there may have been three people in the vehicle at the time, who all left the scene after the collision.</p>
      <p>Investigations are ongoing and officers are appealing for witnesses.</p>
      <p>Sgt Pinner Rana, of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> motor patrols department, said: "We received a report of a collision in Longbenton at 7.11am.</p>
      <p>"A vehicle, for reasons yet to be established, has left the road and gone into a garden before crashing into the house.</p>
      <p>"The vehicle burst into flames and caused damage to the property. The people in the car have left the scene on foot.</p>
      <p>"Inquiries are ongoing into the incident and we are appealing for any witnesses to come forward."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to ring Northumbria Police on 101 quoting reference number 246 of 24/11/19.</p>
