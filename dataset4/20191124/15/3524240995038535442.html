      <h1>Bodies of seven migrants on capsized boat found off Italy</h1>

      <p>Rescue authorities found the bodies of seven migrants, including five women, after their boat capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa, coastguard officials said Sunday.</p>
      <p>A patrol boat recovered the bodies of three of the women and customs workers found two more washed ashore after a vessel with some 150 people aboard went down Saturday, the coastguard said.</p>
      <p>Another two bodies were found Saturday on the beach at Cala Galera on the south side of the island.</p>
      <p>Survivors had said late Saturday around 20 people were missing after coast guards reported rescuing nearly 150 migrants when their vessel overturned around 1.5 miles (1.8 kilometres) off the coast.</p>
      <p>The coastguard said rescue operations had been complicated by rough seas “but also owing to a large number of people who fell into the water simultaneously.”</p>
      <p>Italian media reported one Eritrean man and a Libyan man as saying they had lost their wives.</p>
      <p>The public prosecutor in the Sicilian port of Agrigento announced an investigation had been opened into the incident.</p>
      <p>Spanish NGO Open Arms, which Thursday rescued 73 migrants in a separate operation, meanwhile urged European governments to authorise “immediately” the migrants’ disembarkation in a safe port, citing a “critical” situation.</p>
      <p>“We continue to demand that people’s rights, established under international conventions and maritime law, be respected,” tweeted Open Arms’ chef de mission Riccardo Gatti.</p>
