      <h1>ESPN’s New College Football Playoff Picks After Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:30:50+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Only one week remains in the 2019 college football regular season. The College Football Playoff race is reaching a boiling point.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s college football analysts have updated their picks for the College Football Playoff following Week 13 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>There’s been somewhat of a shakeup following Saturday’s results, which included Oregon’s stunning upset loss to Arizona State.</p>
      <p>Here <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/Playoffpredictions191123/college-football-playoff-picks-week-13">are the latest picks from ESPN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Andrea Adelson: </b>1. LSU; 2. Clemson; 3. Ohio State; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Edward Aschoff: </b>1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Kyle Bonagura: </b>1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Utah<br/><b>Bill Connelly: </b>1. Ohio State; 2. LSU; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>David Hale: </b>1. Ohio State; 2. LSU; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Chris Low: </b>1.

      <p>As you can see, there remains a clear top three of LSU, Ohio State and Clemson. The fourth and final spot is down to a couple of teams.</p>
      <p>Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma and Utah appear to be the four teams competing for that final spot.</p>
