        <b>Tommy Fleetwood naturally had a tinge of disappointment at being pipped by Jon Rahm in Dubai, but was delighted with his end to 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tommy Fleetwood expressed his pride after just missing out on a dream finish to the season and declared it was “Jon’s time” after Jon Rahm pulled off a lucrative Dubai double.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood made a blistering finish at the DP World Tour Championship on Sunday, birdying five of the last seven holes to sign for a seven-under 65 and join Rahm at the top of the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Both players knew a victory at Jumeirah Golf Estates would also be enough to win the Race to Dubai and it was Rahm who achieved that feat, sinking a short birdie putt at the last to card a 68 and finish 19 under.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood claimed his first title for 20 months at the Nedbank Golf Challenge seven days earlier and he was left with mixed emotions, but took the positives out of a strong end to 2019.</p>
      <p>“Of course there’s always going to be a little bit of disappointment there, but for the most part I wasn’t in it, I got myself back in it and I am very proud of the way I played on that back nine,” said the Englishman.</p>
      <p>“Jon’s time, Jon’s moment. He’s played unbelievable this year and fair play, great birdie down the last and I’m just happy with my week.”</p>

      <p>Fleetwood is looking forward to recharging his batteries before continuing where he left off at the start of next year.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m looking forward to a break first. I’m looking forward to waking up tomorrow with nothing to do. Kids can go to school, Clare [Fleetwood’s wife and manager] can do a bit of work and I can do nothing.</p>
      <p>“That’s going to be really nice and then get back at it when I do get the clubs out again, but for now I’m just ready for a break.</p>
      <p>“These last two weeks have definitely painted the season in a brand new light and I have a lot more satisfaction than before. I’ll have a break and get ready to crack on next year.”</p>
