      <p>Mekala has spent months in intensive care in a hospital in Hoi An, Da Nang.</p>
      <p>Mum Yvonne and stepdad Jimmy McAulay, 64, both jetted out to be at her side.</p>
      <p>Now according to <a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/health/mekala-back-edinburgh-after-vietnam-ordeal-nearly-claimed-her-life-1320918">Edinburgh Evening News</a> Mekala has returned to Scotland's capital.</p>
      <p>She flew back to the UK via Manchester before an ambulance drove her up the road to Scotland.</p>
      <p>Mr McAulay, a taxi driver, said: “Mekala is safely home, with no problems. We are all emotional wrecks — but in a good way.</p>
      <p>"Mekala's mum and I are so excited that she's home and safe, although there's still a long way to go.</p>
      <p>Mrs McAulay told followers on Facebook: "Mekala has arrived safely in the ERI and is comfortable. She will just be resting tonight as the wee scone is shattered."</p>
      <p>Well-wishers have raised over £12,000 to help support Mekala's family with the costs of travel and treatment.</p>
