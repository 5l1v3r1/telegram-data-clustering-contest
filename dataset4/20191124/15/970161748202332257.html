        <b>Ronnie O’Sullivan is back to defend his UK Championship title this year after being ‘riled up by the crowd’ on his way to lifting the trophy in 2018.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rocket triumphed at the UK Championship for a seventh time last season and celebrated in an uncharacteristically flamboyant manner.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old has a very calm demeanour about him these days, but it was not the case at the Barbican in York last December after beating Mark Allen 10-6 in the final.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan poured a bottle of water over his own head and jumped on the barrier to hold his trophy aloft in front of the fans.</p>
      <p>It was unusual to see the Rocket celebrate in such a way and he has explained that it was down to the crowd getting on his back, a rare occurrence for the ever-popular player.</p>

      <p>‘I was being riled up by the crowd. Obviously, it was an important match and sometimes your emotions overspill,’ O’Sullivan told <a href="https://sports.betway.com/en/sports/cat/snooker">Betway</a>.</p>

      <p>‘I took quite a bit of stick during the game, which I thought was a bit uncalled for. It became more emotional for me than usual.</p>
      <p>‘I just thought: “Two fingers up to you. You’re going to have to watch me celebrate 19 major titles.”‘</p>
      <p>The win in Yorkshire took O’Sullivan’s Triple Crown tally to 19, more than any other player in history as he went past Stephen Hendry’s previous record of 18.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan is often blasé about breaking records, but his 19 major titles is one he holds dear because it proves how long he has maintained such a high standard for.</p>

      <p>‘It’s the consistency,’ continued O’Sullivan. ‘Anything that relates to consistency is pretty cool, and it was done over a long period of time.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve won a lot of major tournaments with a lot of pressure involved. I think it’s got to be up there with one of the best achievements that anyone can achieve in any sport.’</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan has won more UK Championships (7) and Masters (7) than any other player, although he is not top of the pile at the World Championship.</p>

      <p>The Rocket has won the biggest tournament of them all five times, but remains behind Stephen Hendry (7) and Steve Davis (6).</p>
      <p>He can grab another piece of snooker history at the UK Championship this year, not just the first player to win 20 Triple Crown title.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan and Hendry are level at the top of the list of ranking event wins with 36 each, the Rocket can soar ahead of the Scot with another win in York.</p>
      <p>The world number two gets his UK Championship campaign underway at this year’s event against Ross Bulman in the evening session on Thursday 28 November.</p>
