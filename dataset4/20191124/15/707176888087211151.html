      <h2>Energy companies act to protect shareholders against Labour’s nationalisation plans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:10:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Nathalie Thomas</a></address>
      <p>National Grid and SSE have shifted large parts of their UK operations into offshore holding companies to try to protect shareholders against the threat of assets being nationalised by a future Labour government at below market value.</p>
      <p>Labour included <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ffe28e1e-0c73-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">a pledge</a> in its manifesto last week to take back into public hands the wires and pipes that deliver electricity and gas to British homes and businesses. </p>
      <p>These energy network companies are currently owned by a combination of listed and private groups, including National Grid, SSE and Spain’s Iberdrola, which have monopolies over certain parts of the infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Labour has accused the companies of “overcharging customers to the order of billions of pounds” and suggested that shareholders would not receive compensation based on market value under its nationalisation plans.</p>
      <p>Some consumer groups have also criticised the companies. Citizens Advice accused them of making billions of pounds in <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/cymraeg/about-us/how-citizens-advice-works/media/press-releases/energy-networks-making-75bn-in-unjustified-profit-over-8-years-citizens-advice-finds/">“unjustified profits”</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>The moves by National Grid and SSE to place much of their UK operations in offshore holding companies could potentially help shareholders secure compensation from a future Labour government based on market value.</p>
      <p>SSE has in recent weeks shifted its UK networks arm into a Swiss holding company. National Grid’s UK business has been put into holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. The Sunday Times first reported the moves.</p>
      <p>John Pettigrew, National Grid chief executive, admitted in a recent interview with the Financial Times that redomiciling “wouldn’t change the UK government’s ability if it chose to renationalise the UK assets”.</p>
      <p>But lawyers have suggested that shareholders can put themselves in the best position to secure market-based compensation by relying on international investment treaties to which the UK is party.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong companies can lodge claims under the UK-Hong Kong bilateral investment treaty. Swiss and Luxembourgian companies are protected under the European energy charter treaty. </p>
      <p>In May, Labour said energy networks would be nationalised via an act of parliament and current owners would be compensated through government bonds issued by the Treasury.</p>
      <p>However, it also said compensation could be subject to deductions to take account of factors including “asset stripping since privatisation”, pension fund deficits and “state subsidies given to the energy companies since privatisation”. </p>
      <p>Labour has also suggested it could pay below market value compensation to investors in English water companies that the party wants to nationalise.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for SSE said: “SSE has incorporated in Switzerland a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary company to acquire, oversee and hold investments or other financial assets.</p>
      <p>“The company has become the holding company for SSE’s electricity transmission and distribution networks through a share-for-share exchange.</p>
      <p>“Switzerland is a party to the energy charter treaty, and the incorporation of a Swiss company is also an additional safeguard, which SSE does not believe would be required in practice, should SSE’s electricity networks businesses and interests in SGN become the subject of proposed legislation for nationalisation.”</p>
      <p>National Grid said: “Labour’s proposals for state ownership of National Grid would be highly detrimental to 1m ordinary people who hold shares in the company, including a large number of pension funds, local authority pension funds and our own employees. </p>
      <p>“To protect their holdings, and in line with our legal fiduciary duty to our shareholders, we have established holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. This has no financial benefit to the company and is solely to protect our shareholders’ interests.”</p>
      <p>A Labour spokesman said energy network companies have been “ripping off the public”. </p>
      <p>He added that efforts by companies to shift their businesses offshore were an “attempt to prolong the rip-off” and “illustrates just why we need the grid back in public hands”.</p>
