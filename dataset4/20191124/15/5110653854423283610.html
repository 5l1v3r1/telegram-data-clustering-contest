      <p>When the Packers (8-2) travel to face the 49ers (9-1) on "<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/sunday-night-football-tonight-time-tv-channel-schedule-week-12/henxsoojiwn41uq033pa96dve">Sunday Night Football</a>" (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC) in the penultimate game of NFL Week 12, there is plenty on the line for NFC playoff positioning.</p>
      <p>Green Bay has no room ahead of Minnesota in the NFC North,and with a loss, would drop into a virtual tie for first place.San Francisco is clinging to a one-game lead over Seattle, and with a loss, could fall into second place.</p>
      <p>Home-field advantage may end up being key in a top-heavy conference field. That gives the game a classic feel, as both teams are back in championship contention at the same time for the first time in a long time.</p>

      <h3>Betting odds for 'Sunday Night Football'</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spread:</b> 49ers by 3</li>
        <li><b>Point total:</b> 48</li>
        <li><b>Odds:</b> <a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Packers +105, 49ers -115</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The 49ers have been essentially basic home-field advantage favorites since the lines were released. They are coming off a big comeback win at home over the Cardinals, while the Packers, hoping to fare better than they did last time they played in California against the Chargers, are well rested to go cross-country after a bye.</p>
      <h3>Packers vs. 49ers all-time series</h3>
      <p>The Packers lead the series 36-30-1. They have won two consecutive meetings, including a 33-30 shootout in Lambeau Field last season. Before that, the 49ers had won four straight, including two playoff games. Between '96 and '10, the Packers took 13 of 14 in stretch to gain the oveall edge.</p>
      <h3>Three trends to know</h3>
      <p>— 55 percent of spread bettors are on the Packers. A whopping 67 percent of moneyline bettors like the Packers to win outright.</p>
      <p>— With Aaron Rodgera and red-hot QB counterpart Jimmy Garoppolo on the field, plus two talented running games, 60 percent of bettors like the game to go over the point total.</p>
      <p>— The Packers are 7-3 against the spread this season. The 49ers are only 5-4-1.</p>
      <h3>Three things to watch</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Packers run defense vs. 49ers' rushing offense</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Packers have the No. 25 run defense in the NFL, giving up on average 126.9 yards per game at a high 4.8 yards per carry. The 49ers are second in the NFL at 149 yards rushing per game at a modest 4.3 yards per carry.</p>
      <p>Green Bay will try to clean up some things after the bye as its front seven has sprung plenty of leaks. San Francisco has cooled off on the ground in recent weeks, relying more on Garoppolo to air it out with more unfavorable game scripts.</p>
      <p>The 49ers will look to get Tevin Coleman and Raheem Mostert going in this one after the team racked up 174 yards rushing at Lambeau last season, with Mostert getting 12 carries for 87 of those yards.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rodgers vs. the 49ers' pass defense</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Packers have the No. 11 passing offense going up against the No. 1 pass defense, which is allowing on average 142.5 yards passing per game, yielding only 10 TD passes vs. 11 interceptions. Rodgers lit up a much-different looking pass rush and secondary for 425 yards and 2 TDs at 9.2 yard per attempt last season. He'll need to be point, using his legs to buy time to get the ball downfield with his arm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The return of Kittle</b>
      </p>
      <p>49ers tight end George Kittle is a game-time decision but is trending to return after missing two games with his knee and ankle injuries. The Packers have been vulnerable in coverage to tight ends all season. Kittle can make a huge difference in this game as the Packers have good cornerbacks with whom to contain the 49ers' wideouts.</p>
      <h3>Stat that matters</h3>
      <p>Garoppolo has done this over the past four games: 100-of-150 for 1,164 yards passing for 11 TDs to 4 INTs. That's a 66.7 completion percentage and 7.8 yards per attempt for a stellar 103.3 passer rating. If the 49ers can run more effectively to set him up and he stays hot, they can't be beat.</p>
      <h3>Packers vs. 49ers prediction</h3>
      <p>The Packers will make this another high-scoring meeting with the combination of Rodgers and Aaron Jones to complicate matters for the 49ers' defense and continue to throw it a little off-balance. The 49ers will have great success executing big plays running and passing. Matt LaFleur and Kyle Shanahan are two bright offensive minds who know each other well, but Green Bay has a bigger glaring defensive hole than San Francisco does.</p>
