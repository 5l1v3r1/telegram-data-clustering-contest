      <p>Newcastle United have joined the clutch of clubs watching Monaco’s highly-rated centre-back Benoit Badiashile.</p>
      <p>The Magpies sent a scout to the Ligue 1 club’s clash with Bordeaux and Badiashile, who is being monitored by Chelsea, is one of the biggest talents on show as <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/club-scouts-been-very-busy-17093471">Newcastle continue European reconnaisance missions</a>.</p>
      <p>Wolves, West Brom, Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona were among the clubs represented at the Ligue 1 fixture, with Scouts in Attendance reporting a Newcastle talent spotter was also present.</p>
      <p>A strong, ball-playing centre-back who is a regular for the France under-19 squad, he is being touted as a future full international and a potentially £30million-plus talent for the Ligue 1 side.</p>
      <p>He has been attracting plenty of attention from England with Frank Lampard’s Blues and Wolves among the clubs reported to have made enquiries about him.</p>
      <p>United were also monitoring Josh Maja last season before the striker left Sunderland to join Bordeaux. But the young forward is unlikely to start for his new club, having come off the bench in recent fixtures.</p>
