      <p>Anthony Joshua has vowed to deliver an "iconic evening of boxing" when he goes toe-to-toe with Andy Ruiz Jr in their eagerly-awaited rematch next month.</p>
      <p>The British heavyweight touched down in Saudi Arabia on Sunday as he prepares for their Clash on the Dunes on December 7.</p>
      <p>Joshua appeared in high spirits as he posed for snaps with fans and will now look to put in the final preparations for his showdown with his Mexican rival.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr pulled off one of the biggest shocks in boxing history in June when he knocked Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round.</p>

      <p>Joshua has a chance of redemption in less than two weeks and he has promised a memorable fight for fans.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s going to be an incredible night and I’m thrilled so many of my fans are going to be there, particularly from the UK.</p>
      <p>"It’ll definitely be a night people will tell their grandchildren they were at, one of those iconic evenings of boxing. Everyone from Saudi has been brilliant to work with."</p>
      <p>Joshua also recently said he will demand the boxing world "bows down" to him if he wins back his world titles.</p>

      <p>Joshua told  <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11865835/ruiz-jr-vs-joshua-2-anthony-joshua-says-i-want-everybody-to-bow-to-me">Sky Sports</a>  : "They think he's so great, so when I beat him I want everybody to bow to my feet and tell me how great I am."</p>
      <p>"I couldn't beat Ruiz Jr before and get the credit I deserved.</p>
      <p>"You saw me in the ring [before the fight] - I wasn't fighting King Kong, was I? [I didn't have] that mindset.</p>
      <p>"Apparently I'm fighting the quickest hands and the best fighter in the division. So once I beat him I want everybody to bow to me."</p>

      <p>Joshua has armed himself with a keen sense of perspective in the months following his loss to Ruiz, a late replacement who was considered a mere stepping stone to bigger unification bouts against the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> .</p>
      <p>He insists that training back at the GB headquarters in Sheffield, where his international career began amid budget hotel stays and strict group training sessions, will give him a crucial advantage as he seeks the win that will resurrect his career.</p>
      <p>"I've learned a lot of things from the defeat," added Joshua. "I've learned to take a loss like a man, and to be thankful that I have a second opportunity to go again.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to talk about it too much because the thing that goes on the record is the loss, not the description. It definitely had an effect on me, but it takes more than that to knock a man like me back."</p>
