      <p>MV Jireh – a former Norwegian fjord ferry which is apparently en route to new owners in Senegal – arrived off the coast of Gorey on 5 November.</p>
      <p>Days later the crew of nine asked for a berth in St Helier Harbour, but when told they would need to appoint shipping agents they left and anchored off the coast of Guernsey.</p>
      <p>On Friday the ship’s second-officer, who said his name was Mikhail, told reporters that they had not been paid for two months, and they were rationing water and running low on food.</p>
      <p>Last week, Guernsey Red Cross sent clothes to the ferry, while the Co-op sent food, as questions were raised over why the vessel was in local waters.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night Jireh left the Little Russel – the body of water between Guernsey and Herm – and by yesterday morning was anchored off the coast of Weymouth.</p>
      <p>Speaking before the ship left, Mikhail said that the crew were ‘in a bad mood’. He said they wanted to dock in St Peter Port and added: ‘We will comply with your local regulations. We will stay on the boat all the time.</p>
      <p>‘Our problem number one is that we want to put the vessel in a safe place. Aafter that we will discuss about provisions and fresh water.</p>
      <p>‘We have nine days of supplies. After that, no provisions.’</p>
      <p>He claimed that the crew had not been paid for two months but hoped to receive payment on 2 December.</p>
      <p>The crew said that drinking water was being rationed so that it can act as ballast to keep the ship stable and make the wait more comfortable.</p>
      <p>Ship-tracking websites show that the ferry left Norway on 28 October and after passing through most of the English Channel made a sharp turn towards the Channel Islands in early November before anchoring off Jersey’s east coast. It arrived in the Little Russel on 13 November.</p>

      <p>Mikhail said the crew was waiting for an international inspector to go on board to discuss the problems: ‘We’ve discussed it with our owner but we’ve not had any useful information.’</p>
      <p>The boat, which was previously called Strandebarm and operated in the Norwegian fjords, was recently sold to Herald Marine and Energy Ltd in Senegal and is now registered in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Efforts to contact the new owners were unsuccessful, and a visit to its listed website revealed that it had been hacked.</p>
