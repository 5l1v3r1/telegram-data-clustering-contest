      <p>Madrid -<b> Croatia</b> will play either <b>India</b> or <b>Pakistan</b> to qualify for next year's <b>Davis Cup</b>, after the draw for the qualification stage was made on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 2018 champions crashed out in the group stage of this week's tournament in Madrid, with the final on Sunday pitting Rafael Nadal's Spain against Canada.</p>
      <p>Spain, Canada and the two losing semi-finalists, Great Britain and Russia, automatically qualify for the competition next year, as well as Serbia and France, who have been granted the two wild card slots.</p>
      <p>It leaves 12 places for the winners of the qualifiers, which will be contested on the weekend of March 6 and 7.</p>
      <p>Ties will consist of four singles matches and one doubles, with all rubbers played over the best-of-three tie-break sets.</p>
      <p>Other stand-out fixtures include Colombia facing 2016 champions Argentina, and 28-time winners Australia taking on Brazil. Germany, who lost to Britain in this year's quarter-finals on Friday, will be up against Belarus.</p>
      <p>Croatia, Colombia, Australia and Germany will all be at home.</p>
