      <p>Make sure you check out who is active and who isn’t before the NFL Week 12 early afternoon slate of games while you set your lineups:</p>
      <h3>Noteworthy Inactives</h3>
      <p><b>Matthew Stafford, QB, Detroit Lions (back)</b> – Stafford will miss his third straight game this week with a fractured back. Jeff Driskel will get the start against an abysmal Redskins defense and has decent streaming value for fantasy.</p>
      <p><b>James Conner, RB, Pittsburgh Steelers (shoulder)</b> – Conner was ruled out after he re-aggravated a shoulder injury last week after sitting out Weeks 9 and 10. Jaylen Samuels will be the No. 1 for Pittsburgh, but will split carries with Trey Edmunds and Benny Snell.</p>
      <p><b>Devonta Freeman, RB, Atlanta Falcons (foot)</b> – Freeman will miss a second straight game since spraining his foot in Week 10. Brian Hill will be the starter out of the backfield and may share touches with Kenjon Barner and Qadree Ollison. Hill had a quiet Week 11 with 15 carries for 30 yards, but has the volume if you are desperate.</p>
      <p><b>Jordan Howard, RB, Philadephia Eagles (shoulder)</b> – Howard still has not been cleared for contact and is expected to sit out Sunday’s game against the Seahawks <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482331641749506">per Adam Schefter</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/JFMcMullen/status/1197947771107598336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197947771107598336&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bleedinggreennation.com%2F2019%2F11%2F24%2F20980100%2Feagles-vs-seahawks-injury-updates-jordan-howard-alshon-jeffery-nelson-agholor-fantasy-football-news">Sources told Eagles insider John McMullen</a> that he is dealing with more than just a stinger. The Eagles will lean on a committee of Jay Ajayi, Miles Sanders and Boston Scott.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Breida, RB, San Francisco 49ers (ankle)</b> – Breida is listed as doubtful for Sunday’s game against the Packers. He did not practice all week and is likely to miss at least another week with a lingering ankle injury. Tevin Coleman and Raheem Mostert will see the most touches, but Jeff Wilson could also be a factor with the 49ers shorthanded.</p>
      <p><b>JuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers (concussion)</b> – Smith-Schuster was ruled out for Sunday’s game after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/browns-steelers-fantasy-football-takeaways-juju-smith-schuster-james-conner/">scary helmet-to-helmet hit in Week 11</a>. The Steelers will lean on James Washington, Johnny Holton and Diontae Johnson (concussion), who is expected to play, in a cupcake Week 12 matchup against the winless Bengals.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Nelson Agholor, WR, Philadelphia Eagles (knee)</b> – Agholor comes into this matchup questionable and is unlikely to play, per Adam Schefter. The Eagles will lean on Alshon Jeffery (ankle), who is expected to play, as well as Jordan Matthews, JJ Arcega-Whiteside, Mack Hollins and recently signed Greg Ward.</p>
      <p><b>Phillip Dorsett, WR, New England Patriots (concussion)</b> – Dorsett <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeReiss/status/1198241620115759104">has not been cleared</a> to resume football activities after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-11-mitch-trubisky-marlon-mack/">suffering a concussion in Week 11</a>. He is listed as questionable going into Sunday’s game against the Cowboys, but is unlikely to play. With Mohamed Sanu (ankle) possibly out, the Patriots will continue to lean on Julian Edelman, as well as N’Keal Harry and Jakobi Meyers.</p>
      <p><b>A.J. Green, WR, Cincinnati Bengals (ankle)</b> – Green was ruled out once again and it’s becoming unlikely that he plays this year. With Auden Tate (neck, concussion) questionable, the Bengals will look to Tyler Boyd and Alex Erickson at receiver against a stout Steelers defense.</p>
      <p><b>Evan Engram, TE, New York Giants (foot)</b> – Engram has not practiced or played since spraining his foot in Week 9 and was ruled out against the Bears. With backup tight end Rhett Ellison (concussion) also out, Kaden Smith will get the start with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/scott-simonsons-giants-return-comes-with-rough-assignment/">Scott Simonson backing him up</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Austin Hooper, TE, Atlanta Falcons (knee)</b> – Hooper was ruled out early in the week while still dealing with a sprained MCL. Luke Stocker and Jaeden Graham will be the Falcons’ available tight ends against the Buccaneers, but neither is fantasy relevant.</p>
      <p><b>Rhett Ellison, TE, New York Giants (concussion)</b> – Ellison has not cleared the concussion protocol and has been ruled out for Sunday’s game against the Bears. Starter Evan Engram (foot) is also out, meaning Kaden Smith and Scott Simonson will be New York’s available tight ends.</p>
      <p><b>David Njoku, TE, Cleveland Browns (wrist)</b> – Njoku practiced on Wednesday and was eligible for return this week against the Dolphins. He was not activated off of injured reserve, however, and has missed every game since Week 2 when he broke his wrist.</p>
      <h3>Noteworthy Actives</h3>
      <p><b>Tom Brady, QB, New England Patriots (elbow)</b> – Brady was a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/tom-brady-elbow-injury-pops-up-out-of-nowhere/">surprise late addition to the Friday injury repor</a>t and is listed as questionable for Sunday’s matchup against the Cowboys. <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1198528934398193665">Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports</a> that he is expected to play, and it was about managing the injury more than anything. The 42-year old quarterback has not missed a game due to injury since 2008.</p>
      <p><b>Mitchell Trubisky, QB, Chicago Bears (hip)</b> – Trubisky was not listed on the Bears’ final injury report and will start against the Giants on Sunday. He was benched late the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game in the midst of another poor performance and it was announced later that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-11-mitch-trubisky-marlon-mack/">he had suffered a hip injury</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Phillip Lindsay, RB, Denver Broncos (foot, wrist)</b> – Lindsay was not listed on the final injury report for the Broncos and will play in Week 12 in Buffalo. He has emerged as the No. 1 above Royce Freeman in the Denver backfield.</p>
      <p><b>Adrian Peterson, RB, Washington Redskins (toe)</b> – Peterson is listed as questionable going into Week 12 with a toe injury. He is expected to play <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1198530947689304064">per Ian Rapoport</a>, and will split carries with Derrius Guice.</p>
      <p><b>Julio Jones, WR, Atlanta Falcons (foot)</b> – Jones did not practice on Wednesday, but returned on Thursday and was not on the Falcons’ injury report. He gets a mouth-watering matchup against the Buccaneers this week, as the Falcons look to make a clean sweep of the NFC South.</p>
      <p><b>Amari Cooper, WR, Dallas Cowboys (knee)</b> – Cooper was not on the final injury report for the Cowboys and should be good to go against the Patriots. He might get the Stephon Gilmore treatment, so temper expectations for fantasy.</p>
      <p><b>Tyler Lockett, WR, Seattle Seahawks (shin)</b> – Lockett was not listed on the Seahawks’ final injury report and should be good to suit up after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/seahawks-star-tyler-lockett-hospitalized-with-severe-injury/">scary injury he suffered</a> before Seattle’s Week 11 bye that required hospitalization.</p>
      <p><b>Brandin Cooks, WR, Los Angeles Rams (concussion)</b> – Cooks has cleared the concussion protocol and will start against the Ravens in Week 12. He has not played since Week 8 and is a risky start in light of quarterback Jared Goff’s lackluster performances of late — and especially if Robert Woods (personal) also returns.</p>
      <p><b>Sterling Shepard, WR, New York Giants (concussion)</b> – <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/sterling-shepard-takes-big-step-with-giants-return-uncertain/">Shepard cleared the concussion protocol</a> and is expected to play in Week 12 against the Bears. He has missed each game since Week 5 and is expected to share targets with Golden Tate. This downgrades Bennie Fowler and Darius Slayton, who has been impactful with Shepard sidelined.</p>
      <p><b>Emmanuel Sanders, WR, San Francisco 49ers (ribs)</b> – Sanders, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-11-mitch-trubisky-marlon-mack/">aggravated a rib injury</a> midway through last week’s game and is listed as questionable, is expected to start against the Packers. He and Deebo Samuel (shoulder), who is also expected to start, will split targets.</p>
      <p><b>Deebo Samuel, WR, San Francisco 49ers (shoulder)</b> – Samuel is listed as questionable going into Sunday night’s game against the Packers. <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482497518088192">Adam Schefter reports</a> that he is expected to play.</p>
      <p><b>Corey Davis, WR, Tennessee Titans (hip)</b> – Davis was left off of the Titans’ final injury report and will play this week against the Jaguars. He missed Week 10 with a hip injury and had an extra week to recover with Tennessee’s Week 11 bye.</p>
      <p><b>Diontae Johnson, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers (concussion)</b> – After suffering a nasty helmet-to-helmet hit last Thursday night that left Johnson <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/browns-steelers-fantasy-football-takeaways-juju-smith-schuster-james-conner/">bleeding from the ears</a>, he is expected to start this week against the Bengals. With Smith-Schuster (concussion) sidelined, he will share targets with James Washington and Johnny Holton.</p>
      <p><b>George Kittle, TE, San Francisco 49ers (knee, ankle)</b> – Kittle is expected to play after missing two games with knee and ankle injuries <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482497518088192">per Adam Schefter</a>. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo will have his full arsenal of receivers with Kittle, Samuel and Sanders all expected to play. Ross Dwelley will remain the 49ers’ backup.</p>
      <p><b>Delanie Walker, TE, Tennessee Titans (ankle)</b> – Despite the doubtful designation on the injury report, head coach Mike Vrabel says Walker will suit up against the Jaguars this week. Walker has been absent since Week 6 while dealing with an ankle injury but he practiced on Thursday. He may split targets with Jonnu Smith, who filled in for him in his absence.</p>
      <h3>Still Questionable</h3>
      <p><b>Chris Thompson, RB, Washington Redskins (toe)</b> – Thompson returned to practice on Wednesday for the first time since suffering a turf toe injury in Week 6. The team is not optimistic he will play but it will be a game-time decision <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482082873454592">per Adam Schefter</a>. It’s unclear what his availability will be if he does suit up, especially now that Derrius Guice has returned.</p>
      <p><b>Robert Woods, WR, Los Angeles Rams (personal)</b> – Woods returned to the team and practiced on Thursday after attending to a personal matter, but head coach Sean McVay would not commit to playing him in Week 12 against the Ravens. The Rams play Monday night, meaning there is a good chance his availability will be unknown on Sunday. The No. 3 receiver behind Cooper Kupp and Brandin Cooks is Josh Reynolds.</p>
      <p><b>Mohamed Sanu, WR, New England Patriots (ankle)</b> – Sanu was limited in practice and is listed as questionable going into Sunday’s game against the Cowboys. <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/22/patriots-wr-mohamed-sanu-expected-to-miss-sundays-game-vs-cowboys/">The Boston Herald reported</a> that he is not expected to play, but overnight news came out that he feels better and might play <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198481736952418304">per Adam Schefter</a>. It will likely be a game-time decision and if he does play, he will be extremely limited.</p>
      <p><b>Alshon Jeffery, WR, Philadelphia Eagles (ankle)</b> – Jeffery was expected to start this week against the Seahawks after missing Week 11 with an ankle injury, but he’s now “iffy,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198627025587703814">per Adam Schefter</a>. If Jeffery is out it would be another blow to an Eagles receiving corps with Nelson Agholor (knee) likely out and DeSean Jackson (abdomen) done for the year.</p>
      <p><b>Auden Tate, WR, Cincinnati Bengals (concussion, neck)</b> – Tate is questionable going into Sunday’s matchup against the Steelers. He suffered a brutal <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-11-mitch-trubisky-marlon-mack/">hit to the head in Week 11</a> and had to be carted off the field. Tyler Boyd and Alex Erickson would be the available receivers for Cincinnati if Tate sits, but neither are strong starts, especially with Ryan Finley under center.</p>
      <p><b>T.J. Hockenson, TE, Detroit Lions (shoulder)</b> – Hockenson was downgraded to questionable in a rare Saturday night injury update. It’s likely he will be a game-time decision against the Redskins. The rookie has been trending downward after a hot start to the season and is not reliable for fantasy, even in this good matchup.</p>
