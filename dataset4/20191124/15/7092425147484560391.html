      <p>Pop band Westlife granted a terminally ill Cork woman's dying wish on Friday night's Late Late Show with a really thoughtful gesture.</p>
      <p>Mairead Nolan, 34, was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer last October, as reported by the Irish Sunday Mirror.</p>
      <p>It has been her dream to meet Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne, Mark Feehily and Kian Egan for a very, very long time.</p>
      <p>The lads made this a reality for the woman, inviting her backstage on Friday for a meet and greet and to watch them rehearse before their live performance.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Irish Sunday Mirror, she said:</p>
      <p>“I am in floods of tears after meeting them, I was just so excited. It was better than my wildest dreams and it has given me a lift and the push I need to fight the cancer.</p>

      <p>“I found out recently that I have a spot on my liver also, so I said to the lads that I didn’t think I would make the concert in August in Pairc Ui Chaoimh.</p>
      <p>“But Nicky said he will bring me up on stage and it gave me a great boost. I will be looking forward to that.”</p>
      <p>Along with her Mum Cora, Mairead started a campaign online in the hopes Westlife would come across it and grant her dying wish.</p>
      <p>Her prayers were answered when she was invited backstage and she ended spending over an hour with the lads chatting and singing.</p>
      <p>“They came over and were hugging me, kissing me and taking selfies. It was the best day of my life,' Mairead added.</p>
      <p>“I can die happy now, if something happens to me at least I know I have met them and they were so nice to me.”</p>
