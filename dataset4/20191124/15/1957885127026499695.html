      <h1>Now Death Stranding is out, Kojima's thoughts are turning back to horror</h1>
      <h2>Horrific news.</h2>

      <p>Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima has revealed he's watching horror movies again with a view to making "the scariest horror game".</p>
      <p>In a tweet on his personal Twitter account, Kojima admitted that whilst developing P.T. - the playable teaser that turned out to be a secret announcement for an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-28-goodbye-p-t-inventive-brilliant-and-troubled">all-new Silent Hill game, Silent Hills</a> - he rented Thai horror The Eye but it was "too scary to finish watching". He also admitted that he was so scared by the cover, he "rented the disc only".</p>

      <p>"As to make the scariest horror game, I'll watch the scary movies in order to awaken my horror soul," Kojima <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1197880438603145216">tweeted</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/24/kojima-horror-game-death-stranding-pt/">VG24/7</a>). "THE EYE is the Thai horror movie I rent when making PT but was too scary to finish watching. The package is scary so I rented the disc only. Will I be able to finish watching?"</p>
      <p>The interesting bit here is that Kojima's readily admitting he's trying to "awaken [his] horror soul". Does this mean Kojima's next project will see him revisit his terrifying early collaboration with pals Guillermo del Toro and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-28-silent-hills-would-have-been-even-better-than-we-thought">Junji Ito</a>? It won't be Silent Hill per se, of course - Silent Hill remains a Konami IP, and Kojima parted from the company, very publicly, several years back - but it looks like <i>something</i> horrifying might be on its way. Watch this space, eh...</p>
