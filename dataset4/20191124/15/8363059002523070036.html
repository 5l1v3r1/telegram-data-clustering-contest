      <p>Just when you thought <i><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/robert-pattinson-is-your-new-batman-probably/">The Batman</a></i> could not possibly cram any more characters into its cast, along comes this bit of news: John Turturro has signed on to play Bat-foe Carmine Falcone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/the-batman-john-turturro-carmine-falcone-1203413802/">The news was shared in Variety</a> and confirmed by <i>The Batman</i> director Matt Reeves on Twitter, using a GIF of what’s probably the best-known role – soon to be reprised in the Turturro-directed <i>The Jesus Rolls</i> – in Turturro’s long and varied career.</p>

      <p>Turturro, as Gotham City crime boss Carmine Falcone, joins newcomer Jayme Lawson as a political candidate who somehow enters the story (read more about that below), as well as <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/report-andy-serkis-and-colin-farrell-could-be-batmans-new-alfred-and-penguin/">Andy Serkis as Alfred, Colin Farrell as the Penguin</a>, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/matt-reeves-batman-has-officially-found-its-jim-gordon-1839399763">Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon</a>, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/robert-pattinsons-batman-will-fight-paul-dano-riddler/">Paul Dano as the Riddler</a>, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/zoe-kravitz-will-play-catwoman-in-matt-reeves-batman-movie/">Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/report-so-robert-pattinson-is-definitely-maybe-batman-now/">Robert Pattinson as the title character</a>.</p>
      <p>At this point, that’s got to be just about all the leading characters, right? Is there anyone currently missing that you hope ends up making the cut? Variety notes that <i>The Batman</i> may well begin filming very soon, though nothing’s official yet – except its targeted release date of June 25, 2021.</p>
