      <p>Jason’s aunt Michele Lynch said on behalf of his family: “Jason was a very caring and gentle guy who was loved and adored by all who knew him.</p>
      <p>“Like many he was unfortunate to get involved in the wrong circle, but this wasn't the end of his story and would later to lead to the start of a promising career.</p>
      <p>“Jason fought addiction then used this as his building blocks and put back into helping and supporting others and became an addiction nurse for the NHS, where he found the utmost satisfaction caring and helping in the community."</p>
      <p>And Michelle went on: “Jason also helped raise thousands for cancer and brain tumour charities as he was always looking to help others less fortunate.</p>
      <p>“He was a loving father and partner, but circumstances changed in 2017 at the young age of 36 when he was diagnosed with a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>"Hopeful and positive as always he thought he’d get through it. After numerous chemotherapy and two operations to the head was paralysed down the right side and lost his speech, Jason fought until it was no longer possible.”</p>
      <p>“Jason passed away on the 19th November with all his family by his bedside and has has left a colossal void in everyone's lives who knew and loved him.”</p>
      <p>Facebook was flooded with poignant messages from heartbroken family and friends who shared their memories of the 'beautiful and caring warrior'.</p>
      <p>In a tear-jerking post, Ewelina posted: "You will always be in my heart and I’ll always remember our good memories and laughs.</p>
      <p>"You were the best thing that ever happened to me, my whole world and that will never change.</p>
      <p>"Those special memories of you will always bring a smile. If only I could have you back for just a little while.</p>
      <p>"We could sit and talk just like we used to do. You always meant so much and always will do.</p>
      <p>"The fact that you’re no longer here will always cause me pain. But you’re forever in my heart until we meet again."</p>

      <p>Jason was just 37 when he was first diagnosed with cancer before undergoing two brain operations and months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>
      <p>Sadly none of his treatments were successful, and as the tumour slowly grew, he lost the ability communicate properly and struggled to remember things.</p>
      <p>His devastated mum wrote online: "I’m broken son, my life will never be the same.</p>
      <p>"You're my boy and always will be, I needed you to keep me strong. You had the strength and positivity these past two years while I was in denial, wishing it was just a dream.</p>

      <p>"You worried about everyone apart for yourself, such a loving, caring person. <br/><br/>"My heart is broken. I love you millions and have beautiful memories I shall treasure forever. You have been taken from me far too soon."</p>
      <p>And Tamara Edgerton said: “An absolute diamond taken far too soon, you were one of the good guys. May you be at peace now.</p>
      <p>“Heartfelt condolences to all of Jason's family at this difficult time.”</p>
