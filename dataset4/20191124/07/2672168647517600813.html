      <p>KOTA KINABALU: The Sumatran rhino is now extinct in Malaysia, as the last known specimen, a cancer-ridden female named Iman died at the Borneo Rhino Sanctuary on Saturday (Nov 23).</p>
      <p>“It is with great sadness that the Sabah Wildlife Department announces the death of Iman, the last Sumatran rhinoceros in Malaysia, at 5.35pm on Nov 23,2019, ” said State Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Christina Liew.</p>
      <p>“Its death was a natural one, and the immediate cause has been categorised as shock, ” she said.</p>
      <p>“Iman was given the very best care and attention since her capture in March 2014 right up to the moment she passed.</p>
      <p>"No one could have done more, ” Liew said.</p>
      <p>She added that Iman had almost died on several occasions due to sudden massive blood loss from her uterine tumours over the years.</p>
      <p>"The team at Tabin provided round-the-clock intensive support and successfully brought her back to good health and egg cell production on several occasions, ” she said.</p>
      <p>Sabah Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga said Iman’s death came sooner than expected.</p>
      <p>“But we knew that she was starting to suffer significant pain from the growing pressure of the tumours into the bladder, ” he said.</p>
      <p>The authorities are still hoping that it would still be possible to obtain some egg cells from Iman for the proposed Malaysia-Indonesia collaboration to protect the species.</p>
      <p>However, the memorandum of understanding (MoU) has not been signed.</p>
      <p>Liew said Sabah was still keen to pursue the MoU despite Iman’s death.</p>
      <p>"There are still ways in which we can collaborate based on our different experiences over the past decade, ” she said.</p>
      <p>“For Sabah, that includes the management of female Sumatran rhinos with reproductive pathology, safe harvesting of gametes from living rhinos and cell culture, ” she added.</p>
      <p>She said Iman and Tam (a male rhino that died on May 27 this year due to kidney and liver damage) both lived on as cell cultures.</p>
