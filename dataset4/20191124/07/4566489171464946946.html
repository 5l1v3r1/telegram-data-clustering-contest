      <h1>Protests drive record poll turnout in Hong Kong</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong's voters turned out in record numbers Sunday for local council elections that the city's pro-democracy movement hopes will pile pressure on the Beijing-backed government to heed their demands after months of violent protest.</p>
      <p>Lengthy queues snaked out of polling stations across the territory in the election for 18 district councils, where high turnout is expected to benefit democratic forces.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Affairs Commission said a record 56 percent of the 4.13 million citizens registered to vote had cast their ballots by Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>It was already the highest turnout in Hong Kong's history of district council elections post handover from British rule, with five hours of voting still to go.</p>
      <p>The selection of 452 councillors -- handling community-level concerns such as bus routes and garbage collection -- traditionally generates little excitement, but has taken on new significance following months of political unrest.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong has been battered by months of mass rallies and violent clashes pitting police against protesters who are agitating for direct popular elections of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's government, as well as a probe into alleged police brutality.</p>
      <p>District councils have long been dominated by the pro-Beijing establishment, and voters seeking change hope that weakening that grip will give their movement fresh momentum.</p>
      <p>"Even though one ballot can only help a little, I still hope it can bring change to society and support street protests in some way," 19-year-old student Michael Ng, voting for the first time, told AFP.</p>
      <p>The vote is the closest Hong Kongers get to direct representation.</p>
      <p>- Voting for choice -</p>

      <p>The territory's top-level legislature is elected by a mix of popular vote and seats reserved for industry groups stacked with China loyalists, which ensures Beijing's control of the city of around 7.5 million.</p>
      <p>The pro-democracy camp is calling Sunday's vote a referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the pro-Beijing government, who have resisted the movement's demands.</p>
      <p>"We are voting to give our judgement on what has happened... we're also voting to make a choice for what is yet to come," said Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy candidate and a prominent figure in the largely leaderless protest movement.</p>
      <p>But the polls are not entirely symbolic: some candidates for next year's legislative elections will be drawn from district councillors, and the bodies also will contribute 117 members to the 1,200-strong Beijing-controlled electoral college that chooses the chief executive.</p>
      <p>Protests have been muted in recent days after pro-democracy figures urged citizens to cease disruptions to avoid giving the government an excuse to delay or suspend the polls.</p>
      <p>No major disturbances were reported.</p>
      <p>"I'm pleased to say that... we should have a relatively peaceful and calm environment to conduct these elections successfully," Lam said after voting in her constituency on Hong Kong island.</p>
      <p>The political unrest kicked into high gear with giant rallies in June against a bill backed by Lam that would allow extraditions to China's opaque justice system.</p>
      <p>The bill was eventually withdrawn as public pressure grew, but the anger that it unleashed sparked wider calls for democracy.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media also ground into gear for election day, trotting out editorials urging Hong Kong residents "to vote to end violence" -- which Beijing blames on rioting youths.</p>
      <p>In a tweet the state-run Global Times posted a bizarre rap video splicing shots of violent clashes and positive interactions between Hong Kong residents and the police, opining "Go tell 'em / people want a peaceful place."</p>
      <p>Analysts expect pro-democracy candidates to see gains in the district councils but still fall short of a majority of slots.</p>
      <p>Campaigning has been marred by acrimony, with one pro-democracy candidate having his ear bitten off in an attack, while 17 other candidates of all stripes have been arrested over protest-related activities.</p>
      <p>Election authorities banned leading democracy activist Joshua Wong from running in the district poll for backing Hong Kong "self-determination".</p>
