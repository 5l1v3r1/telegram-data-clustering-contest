      <p>Bogota, Colombia: Several thousand Colombians continued their protest against President Iván Duque Saturday by banging pots and pans late into the evening in the latest show of rejection against his conservative government.</p>
      <p>Frustrated citizens gathered in capital city Bogota - including outside an unofficial residence of the unpopular leader - to protest by chanting, dancing and holding up signs decrying a range of social and economic woes.</p>
      <p>"Get out Duque!” some cried. "No violence!” yelled others.</p>
      <p>The evening protests capped a day of smaller demonstrations that come on the heels of one of the largest marches in Colombia’s recent history.</p>
      <p>Authorities are maintaining a heightened police presence amidst scattered unrest in the aftermath of a mass protest that drew about 250,000 to the streets Thursday. Military leaders say 7,000 troops remain dispersed around Bogota.</p>
      <p>Duque is hoping to quell the protests with a national dialogue set to begin Sunday when he holds a meeting with mayors and governors.</p>
      <p>"Throughout the week we’ll be meeting with different social sectors,” he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations rocking Colombia come as a tide of unrest grips much of Latin America, with massive protests in countries including Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador. Protesters are clamoring against a wide range of issues, including economic inequality, corruption and political leaders who have lost their support.</p>
      <p>"It’s the sum of various complaints,” Patricia Muñoz Yi, a professor at the Pontifical Xavieran University in Bogota.</p>
      <p>Earlier Saturday, a crowd of several hundred was dispersed with tear gas and a teenage protester seriously injured. Duque said he was ordering an urgent investigation to determine who was responsible for the young man’s injuries.</p>
      <p>"Our solidarity with his family,” Duque said.</p>
