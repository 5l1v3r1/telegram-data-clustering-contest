        <b>Deputy Commissioner of the Electoral Commission (EC), Dr Eric Bossman Asare is eying the National Organiser position of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) currently occupied by Sammi Awuku, General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Johnson Asiedu Nketiah has alleged.</b>

      <p>He disclosed that the recent public commentary of the Deputy Commissioner makes him unfit as a referee who is supposed to supervise over the forthcoming referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Asiedu Nketiah therefore admonishes Dr. Bossman Asare to consider contesting the position of NPP National Organizer  since he is more of a politician than a commissioner of the EC as manifested by hi conduct.</p>
      <p>“As for him [Dr Bossman] he is not fit to occupy the position he is holding now…It will be better he resigns as a deputy EC boss and join the NPP and contest for the postion of a National Organiser,” Mr Nketiah stated on Accra-based Power FM.</p>
      <p>The Deputy EC Chair incurred the wrath of a section of Ghanaians when he was caught on tape canvassing for a ‘NO’ vote in the forthcoming referendum to be held on December 17.</p>
      <p>Ghanaians are expected to vote on article 55(3) of the Constitution which will provide the choice for Ghanaians to contest for local government office on partisan lines or otherwise.</p>
      <p>There have been entrenched stance for those campaigning for and against but in the wake of that, Dr Bossman Asare was heard saying “When you look at best practices in many parts of the World, they tend to favour the partisan. As an academic…when I was teaching in the USA, I used to teach some local government politics. When you look at literature and the best practice argument, what is very clear is that political parties tend to be more responsible when they are given opportunity and let’s be very clear…The best practice argument supports the political parties being engaged at the local level,” he said.</p>
      <p>He campaigned indicating that “voting ‘Yes’ will help eliminate the “winner-takes-all” political system that has been in use for a long time.</p>
      <p>“We shouldn’t also forget that we have always been complaining that the president is given so much powers and we are also complaining about winner-takes-all politics… It [holding partisan elections at the local level] addresses some of the problems with winner-takes-all because not all assemblies will have their Chief Executives from one party,” Dr Bossman added.</p>
