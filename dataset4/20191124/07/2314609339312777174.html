      <h1>United have plenty in reserve to shoot down Bullets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:26:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:26</time> by <a rel="author">Roy Ward</a></address>
      <p>If you asked the Brisbane Bullets who the biggest threats would be for Melbourne United on Sunday, Tohi Smith-Milner would been towards the bottom of their list.</p>
      <p>But after the New Zealand international was thrown into the game just seconds into the third quarter when David Barlow took a knock to the head, Smith-Milner put in a career-best performance with 19 points as his side claimed their sixth straight win with a 108-94 victory over the Bullets at Melbourne Arena.</p>

      <p>Smith-Milner had 16 of his points in the second half, and his tally contributed to a game-changing 42 bench points for Melbourne, who have so often ridden the offensive returns of superstars Chris Goulding, Melo Trimble and Shawn Long to win games.</p>
      <p>Trimble was again exceptional with 25 points and six assists, while Goulding had 14 points. Mitch McCarron almost posted a triple-double with 12 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.</p>
      <p>Long had a tough afternoon finishing with just five points, but Smith-Milner's scoring and an impressive 11 points and 13 rebounds from reserve big man Jo Lual Acuil made sure United remained competitive in the paint, Melbourne's bench outscoring Brisbane's by 14 points.</p>

      <p>Smith-Milner, who scored his points in just 10 minutes, knew he would get some more chances on Sunday, but didnâ€™t see a career game on the horizon.</p>
      <p>"With Alex Pledger out, it kind of forced me and Jo to step up a little bit," Smith-Milner said.</p>
      <p>"Jo was big-time with those rebounds, I was thankful to be in the right spot at the right time."</p>
      <p>Barlow's sudden exit from the game gave Smith-Milner his chance, although the veteran forward returned in the final term to nail a crucial three in the win.</p>
      <p>Bullets guard Jason Cadee scored 15 of his 18 points in the first half, while Nathan Sobey had 17 points.</p>
      <p>Melbourne coach Dean Vickerman praised his side for their passing after spending this week putting extra work into sharing the ball.</p>
      <p>Bullets coach Andrej Lemanis said his side missed too many shots around the basket, but saw plenty of positives following on from their win over Adelaide on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Lemanis had no comment on his future as Australian Boomers coach, which Basketball Australia has refused to address despite reports emerging last week that <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53c78.html">Lemanis would be replaced in the role by Philadelphia 76ers NBA coach Brett Brown</a>.</p>
      <p>But Vickerman asked to make an additional comment after his press conference, and spoke about his favourite memory of Lemanis coaching the national team.</p>

      <p>"He was a great mentor coach to me, and the thing we talked about was Marvel Stadium for those USA games," Vickerman said.</p>
      <p>"My memory of Andrej coaching the Boomers will be being at that stadium, beating that US team and how proud I was as a fan seeing that win and having 55,000 people with me.</p>
      <p>"I shared that with him yesterday, how proud I was of him for what he did for our country and seeing the game grow during his period as a Boomer."</p>
