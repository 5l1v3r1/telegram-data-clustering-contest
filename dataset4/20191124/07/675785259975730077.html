      <h1>Phil Spencer's 5 questions to ask before you apply for a mortgage</h1>
      <h2>Whether you're looking for your first home, a new home or your current deal is expiring, there are a few key questions you have to ask before you start out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Right now mortgages are cheaper than they have been for two years - making bigger loans seem more and more affordable.</p>
      <p>In fact, there are even deals on the market charging less than 1% interest.</p>
      <p>While that doesn't necessarily mean it's time to dive in and grab one - it does mean that if you're already looking for a loan to buy a home or move to a cheaper deal, now's a good time.</p>
      <p>But you also need to make sure it's the right deal for you.</p>
      <p>To help, TV property guru Phil Spencer has explained <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/phil-spencers-top-tips/5-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-applying-for-a-mortgage/">on Zoopla</a> the five key questions people need to ask themselves before signing on the dotted line.</p>
      <p>This is what hey are:</p>
      <h3>1. Can I afford for my mortgage payments to go up?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There are various types of mortgage. And some – such as trackers, and discounts – mean your interest rate, and therefore monthly payments, could go up at short notice. </p>
      <p>If there’s no room in your budget for a rise in repayments, or you simply don’t want to worry about it, go for a fixed rate mortgage – even if it starts out a little more expensive.</p>
      <h3>2. What arrangement fee does the mortgage charge? </h3>
      <p>Some of the cheapest mortgage rates come with ‘a catch’ – the lender will charge a big arrangement fee to set up the deal. Make sure you factor the cost of this fee into the loan rate. This is a quick way to do it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find out the monthly cost of the mortgage by entering the interest rate alongside the amount you want to borrow into an online mortgage calculator (taking note if it’s repayment or interest-only).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>When you have the monthly cost, multiply it by the number of months in the term – for example a two-year fixed rate would be 24 months and a five-year fixed rate would be 60.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Add on the stated mortgage fee and you have the true overall cost of the mortgage.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Do the same again for different deals and compare.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bear in mind arrangement fees become more significant on shorter-term loans as they work out at a higher cost per year.</p>
      <h3>3. Am I free to leave or even overpay?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If you sign up to a specific mortgage deal, you’ll have to pay early repayment charges (ERCs) if you want to redeem the loan before the end of the term. </p>
      <p>In fact, even if you just wanted to overpay – with an inheritance or bonus for example – most lenders will cap this at 10% each year before ERCs kick in. </p>
      <p>ERCs are usually charged at a percentage of the outstanding borrowing. Often this percentage decreases with each year of the deal. In other words, it would be more expensive to leave in year two of a five-year fix than it would in year four.</p>
      <p>Think carefully about your plans before tying yourself into a mortgage long-term.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, some mortgages, such as some lifetime trackers and or those priced on the lender's SVR, don't come with tie-ins (and therefore ERCs) at all.</p>
      <h3>4. Should I use my savings?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>If you are a first-time buyer, chances are you will have exhausted your savings in your quest to raise a deposit and meet all the homebuying fees. </p>
      <p>But if you’ve been a homeowner with a mortgage for a while, you may have built up your savings pot again.</p>
      <p>When it comes to switching deals, rather than keeping these savings in a low-interest account, it could make more sense to use them to reduce the amount of your mortgage. </p>
      <p>That’s because the lower you can drive down your loan to value (the percentage of the house value that is mortgaged), the cheaper your rate will be. You can  <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/buying/understanding-loan-to-value/#zICE8zBWYo1pwyZz.97"><b>find out more about loan to values here</b> </a>. Always do your sums!</p>
      <h3>5. Have I done enough research?</h3>
      <p>It’s impossible to predict the future, but at least you can make the right decision based on your circumstances at the time – and this is never truer than when it comes to getting the right mortgage.</p>
      <p>Make sure you fully research the current mortgage market using comparison websites like  <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/"><b>uSwitch.com</b> </a>.</p>
      <p>If you need further help or have specific needs such as being self-employed or having a poor credit score, then contact an independent fee-free mortgage broker for advice.</p>
