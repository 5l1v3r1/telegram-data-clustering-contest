      <p>Australia opened their Test summer with a win after finishing off an innings-and-five-run victory over Pakistan with a day to spare in Brisbane. Josh Hazlewood snared four second-innings wickets with fellow quicks Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc also chipping in on Sunday to dismiss Pakistan for 335.</p>
      <p>Babar Azam starred for the visitors with his second Test century, as part of a 132-run sixth-wicket stand with Muhammad Rizwan. But after the pair held out for two-and-a-half hours, Nathan Lyon finally broke Pakistan’s resistance when he spun one in and drew the edge, removing Babar for 104.</p>
      <p>Hazlewood (4-63) dismissed Muhammad for 95 after tea, caught at third man trying to uppercut the Aussie quick. It spelt the beginning of the end for Pakistan. The right-armer removed Yasir Shah moments later, and quickly wrapped up Shaheen Shah Afridi.</p>

      <p>Starc finished with 3-73 to make it seven scalps for the match, after he had removed Pakistan captain Azhar Ali and the out-of-sorts Haris Sohail on the third evening. Cummins also had two, to finish with figures of 2-69, after claiming the first wicket of the morning in Shan Masood for 42 to go with Asad Shafiq the night before.</p>
      <p>David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne had previously set up Australia’s commanding position with big centuries, as the hosts hit 580 in reply to Pakistan’s first-innings 240.</p>
      <p>But there were some positive signs for Pakistan. Babar on Sunday showcased all of the talent that made him one of the most promising players in world cricket. He drove through the covers off the front and back foot, and scored at a fair rate considering Pakistan’s predicament in the match.</p>
      <p>Muhammad’s knock was his best in Test cricket, playing with plenty of flair after controversially coming into the squad for former captain Sarfaraz Ahmed. That will at least give them confidence to head to Adelaide for the second and final Test from Friday under lights.</p>
