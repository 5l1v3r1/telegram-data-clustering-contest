      <h1>Authorities take Chinese defector's claims seriously</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:53:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:53</time> by <a rel="author">Nick McKenzie, Grace Tobin and Paul Sakkal</a></address>
      <p>Australian authorities are still assessing and are taking seriously the story of Chinese man Wang Liqiang, who has told agencies that he worked in Hong Kong as a spy for Chinese military intelligence before defecting to Australia.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government, through the Shanghai police, issued a statement on Saturday night purporting to show that Mr Wang was a convicted fraud. Some commentators said the statement proved he was not a spy as he had claimed.</p>
      <p>But <i>The Age</i>, <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>60 Minutes</i> have confirmed that Australian security agencies are actively looking at Mr Wang's case and "are still working through it". Sources said international intelligence agencies were assessing elements of Mr Wang's story.</p>
      <h3>Serious consequences</h3>
      <p>Through a lawyer, George Newhouse, Mr Wang has denied the claims of the Shanghai police that he has a criminal record. He said he had given a sworn statement to the Australian government and stood by it, knowing the consequences of making a false statement would be serious.</p>
      <p><i>The Age</i> and <i>Herald</i> reported on Saturday that Mr Wang had risked imprisonment or execution in China by claiming he had “personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities” on behalf of the Chinese government, and then briefing ASIO about it.</p>
      <p>Mr Wang <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53d0x.html">said his decision to defect was driven by conscience</a> as he came to see the human cost of the subversive war he had been enlisted in. “I was involved in organisations that aim to sabotage world democracy,” he said.</p>
      <h3>A 'friend of democracy'</h3>
      <p>The chair of the federal parliament’s Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Liberal MP Andrew Hastie, called for the government to protect him, saying Mr Wang was a “friend of democracy”.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Saturday said Mr Wang's case was “being handled by the appropriate law enforcement agencies”.</p>
      <p>Labor leader Anthony Albanese said that while he was yet to be briefed on the matter by government agencies, the reports were "a real concern". "We need to make sure that Australia's national sovereignty is protected," Mr Albanese said.</p>
      <p>"We will await processes with the government and one of the things that we will be seeking next week is a briefing from the appropriate authorities on these issues."</p>
      <h3>Fujian fraud charge</h3>
      <p>The Jingan branch of the Shanghai police issued a statement on Saturday saying Mr Wang had been convicted on one fraud charge in October 2016 in Fujian province, and received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months because it was his first offence and he was a university student.</p>
      <p>A second investigation for fraud had opened into him just nine days after he left Hong Kong to come to Australia, the police said.</p>
      <p>It's unclear how he could have been allowed to leave China if he had a fraud conviction.</p>
