      <p>Onyema and Eghagha were indicted by the US for fraud and money laundering of more than $20 million and an arrest warrant has also been issued against them.</p>
      <p>Even though the duo and their lawyers have vehemently denied the allegation against them, they are to be taken into custody if sighted within the jurisdiction of the American and Canadian law enforcement authorities.</p>
      <p>Reports also reveal that the American authorities have also reportedly briefed their Canadian counterparts about their case against the two Nigerians whose bank accounts used for the alleged suspicious transaction in the United States were domiciled in Canada.</p>
