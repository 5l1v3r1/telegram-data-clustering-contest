      <p>Boris Johnson is promising to bring back his Brexit deal to Parliament before Christmas if the Tories are returned to power in the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister will unveil the party’s election manifesto at the Telford International Centre with a pledge to open a “new chapter” in Britain’s history – ensuring the country is out of the EU by the end of January.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have chosen to launch the manifesto in the marginal Telford seat Lucy Allan held with a majority of 720 in 2017.</p>
      <p>The visit of the Tory battle bus comes <a href="https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/politics/general-election-2019/2019/11/06/jeremy-corbyn-in-telford-to-pledge-he-will-end-need-for-food-banks-if-he-becomes-pm/">two weeks after Jeremy Corbyn was in the constituency</a>, which ranks at number nine on a list of Conservative seats most vulnerable to Labour.</p>

      <p>Labour candidate Katrina Gilman needs a swing of just 0.9 per cent to take Telford this time.</p>
      <p>The manifesto will include a “triple tax lock” – guaranteeing the rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT will not rise under a re-elected Conservative government.</p>
      <p>The Tories are also promising a £1 billion boost for after-school and holiday childcare with the aim of providing on-site childcare for 250,000 more primary school children over the summer.</p>
      <p>The manifesto will commit £6.3 billion for energy efficiency measures to cut fuel bills for 2.2 million homes targeting social housing and “fuel poor” families, while maintaining the current energy price cap.</p>
      <p>There will be a £3 billion national skills fund as the first step towards creating a new “right to retrain”.</p>
      <p>In a clear appeal to motorists, the party is promising the country’s “biggest ever” pothole-filling programme, with an injection of £2 billion as part of the Government national infrastructure strategy.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson described his decision to re-introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) – ratifying his Brexit deal with Brussels – in December as an “early Christmas present” for voters fed up with the wrangling over Britain’s departure from the EU.</p>
      <p>“As families sit down to carve up their turkeys this Christmas, I want them to enjoy their festive-season free from the seemingly unending Brexit box-set drama,” he said in a statement ahead of the launch event.</p>

      <p>“The Conservative manifesto, which I’m proud to launch today, will get Brexit done and allow us to move on and unleash the potential of the whole country.”</p>
      <p>Although the bill cannot complete its passage through Parliament before Christmas, the move will be seen as a clear sign of Mr Johnson’s determination to get it through in time for Britain to leave the EU by the January 31 deadline.</p>
      <p>Following the election, the new House of Commons is due to sit for the first time on Tuesday December 17.</p>
      <p>The first two days are likely to be taken up with the swearing in of the new MPs, potentially with the State Opening and the Queen’s Speech on the Thursday.</p>
      <p>That could mean MPs sitting the following Monday – the start of Christmas week – to allow the WAB to be formally introduced, although it is not clear whether there could be any further progress before the holiday.</p>
      <p>MPs in the last parliament voted to back the bill at second reading, but the Prime Minister withdrew it after they refused to support a timetable motion to fast-track it through the Commons in just three days.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: “It’s time to turn the page from the dither, delay and division of recent years, and start a new chapter in the incredible history of this country, the greatest place on Earth.</p>
      <p>“We have achieved amazing things together in the past, and I know we will achieve even more in the future – if only we choose the right path at this critical election.”</p>
      <p>The announcement of the tax lock comes after Mr Johnson let slip last week that the manifesto would include a commitment to raise the threshold for national insurance contributions.</p>
      <p>Initially it will go up to £9,500 saving 31 million taxpayers around £100-a-year. However Mr Johnson’s suggestion it could rise to £12,500 – saving £500-a-year – is described as an “ambition” and it is unclear whether it will be met in the next parliament.</p>

      <p>With older people traditionally more likely to go out and vote, the manifesto commits to maintain the pensions “triple lock”, winter fuel payments and the older persons free bus pass.</p>
      <p>There is a commitment to end “unfair” NHS car parking charges for protected groups – including staff working night shifts, as well as disabled and terminally ill patients and their families.</p>
      <p>On climate change, the manifesto simply sticks to the existing commitment to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 – a target seen as too weak by many environmental groups.</p>
      <p>There will, however, be a ban on the export of plastic waste outside the OECD group of developed nations in an attempt to ensure less plastic is dumped in the oceans.</p>
