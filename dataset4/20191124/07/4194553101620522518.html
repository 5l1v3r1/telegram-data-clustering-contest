      <h1>Richard Keys labels VAR decision at Palace “terrible”, but Roy Hodgson doesn’t agree</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:17:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Former Sky Sports broadcaster Richard Keys is one of many notable people to have called out VAR yet again, after a Crystal Palace goal was ruled out over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Eagles thought they had drawn first blood against Liverpool, but it was ruled out after the officials discovered Dejan Lovren had been fouled in the area.</p>
      <p>Keys took to social media to share his thoughts on the V[A]R decision, and it’s safe to say he doesn’t agree with the technology – as he labelled it “<a href="https://twitter.com/richardajkeys/status/1198266906802819072?s=12"><b>terrible</b></a>“.</p>
      <blockquote>Terrible VR decision at Palace. Terrible.<br/>— Richard Keys (@richardajkeys) <a href="https://twitter.com/richardajkeys/status/1198266906802819072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Naturally, we take issue with this because the decision was in fact correct and the goal should not have stood. It doesn’t matter if the players involved affected the play – the Liverpool man was fouled.</p>
      <p>And this is something that Palace boss Roy Hodgson actually agrees with. I have to admit, I’m a little surprised he’s taken our side in this, but I’ve no reason to assume he’d be biased.</p>
      <p>“<b>There was a foul at the near post – Jordan did unfortunately push Lovren and VAR picked it up and disallowed the goal, so in my opinion [the goal was] rightly disallowed,</b>” <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/news/hodgson-var-was-right-to-disallow-crystal-palace-goal_380408.html">he’s quoted as saying by Sports Mole</a>.</p>
      <p>I mean if the manager of the opposing team can see a foul, when if the decision went the other way his team would have claimed a point, then surely we can stop this anti-Liverpool agenda?</p>
