      <p>The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Supreme-Court">Supreme Court</a> on Sunday did not order an immediate floor test in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> but called for the letters of the Governor to the Centre and to the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a> on government formation to be produced before it.</p>
      <p>A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna issued notices to the Centre and Maharashtra government and told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to place before it the letters of the Governor recommending revocation of President's Rule and inviting Devendra Fadnavis to form government. The apex court will hear the matter again at 10.30 am on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Adjudication of the issues and also the interim prayers sought by the petitioners to conduct floor test within 24 hours has to be considered after perusing the order of the Governor as well as the letters submitted by Mr. Devendra Fadnavis," the court said in its order.</p>
      <p>The apex court gave the order on a petition filed by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine saying the Maharashtra Governor's decision to swear in Fadnavis as chief minister without him enjoying a majority.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate Kapil Sibal who appeared on behalf of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> and Abhishesk Manu Singhvi on behalf of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> argued that the Governor took the step to invite Fadnavis on Friday night at short notice and that no information on these were available on the public domain.</p>
      <p>The petitioners termed as "murder of democracy" the Governor's decision to revoke President's rule after midnight and swear in Fadnavis the next day morning without informing anyone else.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for BJP MLAs, said it was the governor's discretion to invite a party to form the government and that the Court didn't have the power to question it.</p>
      <p>"What the governor did is immune from any judicial review," he argued.</p>
      <p>Justice Ramana rejected that saying, "The Governor can't just summon anyone. He must prove his majority in the House."</p>
      <p>Singhvi told the court that 41 MLAs of NCP are still with Sharad Pawar and that they had written to the Maharashtra Governor saying Ajit Pawar has been removed as the legislative party chief.</p>
      <p>Referring to the apex court's earlier order on Karnataka, Singhvi said a floor test is a Constitutional obligation. Sibal said the time given by the Governor to the ruling party was meant to do "something else".</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena, NCP and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> approached the Supreme Court on Saturday night, hours after the Maharashtra governor swore in BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar as his deputy.</p>
      <p>The court agreed to a hear on Sunday morning their petition that the governor's order be quashed and they be invited instead.</p>
