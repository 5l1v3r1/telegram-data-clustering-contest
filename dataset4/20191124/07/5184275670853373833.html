      <p>“It was so heartwarming to see people turn up even though the cold was unbearable. There is so much zeal in people to be happy and the Laugh Out Loud sessions give them the chance to do that. It was all the more special because it was the last session of this season,” said Kher.</p>
      <p>With a body of work of over 500 films, Kher has made his mark in Bollywood and has also worked in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>His new film “Hotel Mumbai” is scheduled to open on November 29. The film is directed by Anthony Maras and features Dev Patel in a starring role. It narrates the story of the 26/11 terror strike at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Palace hotel in 2008.</p>
