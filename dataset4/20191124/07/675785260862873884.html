      <h2>Deontay Wilder set up a heavyweight rematch with Tyson Fury after he produced a stunning punch to KO Luis Ortiz - but the Cuban had the upper hand for much of the fight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:38:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:38</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder needed to knock out Luis Ortiz to maintain his unbeaten professional record - with the scorecards showing he was heavily behind in the fight.</p>
      <p>Heavyweight champion Wilder was well behind on all three scorecards after six rounds, after Cuban Ortiz had boxed superbly to put himself in the box seat for a shock.</p>
      <p>But 'The Bronze Bomber' produced an incredible punch to knock out his rival in the seventh round - with 40-year-old Ortiz unable to get back to his feet before the referee had finished his count.</p>
      <p>That may have set him on a collision course with a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> rematch, but it didn't hide his six rounds of being bettered - with the judges giving scores of 56-58, 55-59, and 55-59 in Ortiz's favour.</p>

      <p>Eric Cheek had Ortiz up by two points having given him the third, fourth and fifth rounds, with Wilder winning the first.</p>
      <p>Dave Moretti adjudged Ortiz to have an even greater margin, having handed him the first five rounds before Wilder claimed the sixth.</p>
      <p>And Steve Weisfeld scored identically to Moretti.</p>
      <p>In the 'explain deduction of points or comments' section was written: "Ortiz scalp laceration head butt first round."</p>
      <p>Wilder admitted Ortiz was "very crafty" and "moves strategically" before confirming that British superstar Fury is next on his to-do list.</p>
      <p>“With Ortiz, you can see why no heavyweight wants to fight him, he’s very crafty and he moves strategically," said Wilder.</p>
      <p>“I had to measure him in certain places. Some people say I can’t fight on my back foot but that’s my speciality. I had to go back and forward, my intellect is very good in the ring.</p>
      <p>“I finally found my measurement, I saw the shot and I took it. He’s one of the best in the world, you've got to give him that.</p>
      <p>“Next is Tyson Fury, that is settled for February and then I want a unification fight.”</p>
      <p>Ortiz added: “This is boxing, I told everybody that it was going to be him or me and that it wasn't going to go 12 rounds.</p>
      <p>“I was clear-headed. When he said seven I was trying to get up but the count was maybe quicker than I thought."</p>
