      <p>An NYPD cop was busted Saturday night for allegedly choking and hitting his wife at their Queens home, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Carlos Marin, 27, was slapped with assault charges and had an order of protection issued against him on behalf of his wife.</p>
      <p>“He just can’t be where she is,” said Queens Criminal Court Judge Eugene Guarino, before releasing Marin on his own recognizance.</p>
      <p>The case was downgraded from a felony to a misdemeanor.</p>
      <p>During Marin’s arraignment, prosecutors said the wife initially told cops Marin grabbed her around the neck with both hands and hit her repeatedly.</p>
      <p>However, she later told detectives a slightly different story, claiming her husband had one hand around her neck and hit her twice, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Marin remains mum during the arraignment, but his parents sat in the second row crying.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, his mother could be heard saying: “She’s lying. She’s going to mess up his career.”</p>
      <p>Marin declined to comment as he left court a sweatshirt hood pulled over his head.</p>
