      <h1>No. 20 Boise State scores 49 by half to rout Utah State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:32:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Jaylon Henderson passed for three touchdowns, and George Holani rushed for a career-best 178 yards and scored two touchdowns as No. 20 Boise State annihilated Utah State 56-21 on Saturday night in Mountain West play at Logan, Utah.</p>
      <p>Avery Williams returned a punt for a touchdown for the second time this season and fourth in his career for the Broncos (10-1, 7-0), who clinched the Mountain Division title and a spot in the conference championship game on Dec. 7 against West Division winner Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Jalen Walker had an interception return for touchdown as Boise State improved to 19-5 all-time against the Aggies.</p>
      <p>Jordan Love completed 21 of 36 passes for 229 yards, one touchdown and one interception for Utah State (6-5, 5-2). Gerold Bright and backup quarterback Henry Colombi rushed for touchdowns, and Caleb Repp caught a scoring pass for the Aggies, who were outgained 484-428.</p>
      <p>Henderson completed 16 of 28 passes for 187 yards while starting for the second straight week with first-stringer Hank Bachmeier (shoulder) and second-stringer Chase Cord (hand) apparently still nursing injuries.</p>
      <p>Boise State had 383 yards in the first half — 231 on the ground — en route to a 42-7 lead.</p>
      <p>Walker’s 15-yard interception return put the Broncos ahead to stay with a 14-7 lead with 5:14 left in the opening quarter. Holani added scoring runs of 5 and 1 yards — the first came on the Statue of Liberty play — as Boise State opened up a 28-7 lead with still 1:20 remaining in the stanza.</p>
      <p>Robert Mahone scored on a 1-yard run with 6:11 left in the second quarter, and Henderson threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Khalil Shakir with 19 seconds remaining to account for the 35-point halftime lead.</p>
      <p>The onslaught continued in the third quarter when Williams fielded a punt and took it back 74 yards for a score with 12:28 left in the frame.</p>
      <p>Henderson threw a 15-yard scoring pass to CT Thomas to make it 56-7 with 4:32 remaining in the quarter.</p>
      <p>Bright scored on a 6-yard run with 26 seconds left in the third quarter, as Utah State snapped a string of 49 straight Boise State points. Colombi tacked on a 2-yard keeper with 1:40 left in the contest.</p>
      <p>The Aggies’ first touchdown came on Love’s 7-yard touchdown pass to Repp, which followed the first score of the game as Boise State’s John Hightower took a shovel pass from Henderson and raced 30 yards for the touchdown.</p>
