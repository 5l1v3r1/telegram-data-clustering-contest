      <p>Mel B will pay $1.8 million to end a defamation spat with a former nanny.<br/><br/>Lorraine Gilles, 27, filed a suit against Mel in 2017, claiming the Spice Girls star defamed her by implying she was a "prostitute" who fell pregnant with her ex-husband, Stephen Belafonte's baby.<br/><br/>The out-of-court settlement means the matter will not go to trial and private details about Mel's marriage will not be discussed.<br/><br/>A source tells The Mirror Mel B and Gilles have agreed to "go their separate ways and not bad mouth each other," adding, "Mel was just happy to clear this mess up once and for all.<br/><br/>"Things were said in court papers in the heat of a divorce, which exploded into this lawsuit. But in recent weeks their frost has thawed, with them even meeting in the same room to work out their differences."</p>
