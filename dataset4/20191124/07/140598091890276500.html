        <b>The ultimate spa getaway to go on with your girlfriends? Rosie Green has found it for you</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Your needs from a spa getaway change as your companion does. A romantic break calls for couple’s treatment rooms, secluded areas to loll about in and a menu that isn’t going to make your stomach emit sounds like a dying velociraptor at night. Go with kids and you want sports activities/a crèche to entertain them whilst you get your knots kneaded (and a restaurant that’ll serve them sausages).</p>
      <p>What about travelling with girlfriends? Well, if you are like me, you want a spa that provides restorative treatments, but also delivers good grooming. Because returning from a spa break with glossy hair and painted toes has to be the ultimate feel-good hit. You also need a pool to congregate around and buzzy restaurants within walking distance for going out out. Oh and some retail opportunities.</p>
      <p>Enter two Andronis hotels on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/cyclades/santorini/">Santorini</a>. Santorini might be known as a couple’s destination, but I think it’s equally suited to a mate’s getaway.</p>

      <p>I went with my friend and YouTube beauty guru, Nadine Baggott. First we went to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/cyclades/santorini/hotels/andronis-arcadia-hotel/">Andronis Arcadia</a> in Oia. There are eight Andronis hotels on the island and they are all light, bright and chic. Arcadia is the group’s newest hotel and we did a mini dance of joy when we were shown to our suites. Each had its own infinity pool. (Which, curiously we didn’t so much as dip a toe in.)</p>
      <p>It’s not a beach hotel, but the pool is spectacular and scene-y with an incredible view of the Aegean. The sunset was possibly the most spectacular I’ve ever seen.</p>
      <p>Nadine and I set the tone by ordering two margaritas. Rather than some strict detox, the hotel offers healthy choices and local organic food, but also has great wine and cocktails. Here, you can be as healthy as you want to be. Some guests, like us, are there for the spa, but for most it’s just a nice extra.</p>

      <p>We opted to eat in the Pacman restaurant as the more formal Opson felt too stiff and had a “food archeologist”, which felt like one marketing concept too far.</p>
      <p>Here I need to make special mention of the breakfast cart– a delight of seeds, nuts and berries and yoghurt. Instagram gold and as a front loader (definition – someone who eats most in the morning) it was a true highlight.</p>
      <p>The Evexia spa was large and serene. And either no one else was in there or they somehow made it feel that way. They used Ila products and the therapists had skill and a real passion for their job. There was a Kneipp circuit (cold and warm water plunge pools designed to boost circulation and endorphins) plus free daily yoga and hiking.  </p>

      <p>After two days, we headed to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/cyclades/santorini/hotels/andronis-concept-wellness-resort-hotel/">Andronis Concept Wellness Resort</a>. It has the same design vibe and is in picturesque Imerovigli. This time the rooms and the restaurant overlooked the incredible caldera. This hotel is described as a “wellness destination”, and there were plenty of healthy activities to engage in, but like the Arcadia you could take it as far as you liked. The Kallos spa was excellent, and it had a hairdressers/hair spa where I had a Kerastase treatment and blow dry. It also offered hair profiling, where you hand over a strand and it’s analysed for everything from stress levels to vitamin deficiencies.</p>

      <p>Any downsides? Well apart from the wind, which makes for a permanent bad hair day, I can’t find much to fault the resorts with (although the black loo roll is questionable). If you are planning a getaway with your BFFs I can think of no better place to book. It’s worth it for the breakfast cart alone.</p>
