      <p>Burruss and Tucker first confirmed that they were having a baby via surrogate on the Season 12 premiere of <i>RHOA</i>. Burruss shared that the two were expecting a girl, and were originally expecting twins. However, the viewers soon learn that Burrus and Tucker lost one of the twins while their surrogate was in utero.</p>

      <p>Since deciding to go<a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5758154/kandi-burruss-new-baby-girl/"> the surrogacy route</a>, Burruss has been as open as possible about the changes that need to be made in order to ensure their child has everything that they need. The Xscape singer told <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/23/kandi-burruss-first-photo-baby-blaze-todd-tucker-see-pic/"><i>Hollywood Life</i></a> that she had to go through psychological exams to ensure that she was in a healthy mental state when deciding on different issues that would come up in the pregnancy. She shared that her potential surrogate would also have to go through the review in order to check and see where her mental health space is.</p>
      <p>This is Burruss and Tucker’s second biological child together. The couple welcomed Ace into the world back in 2016. The two also have two older daughters from previous relationships, Riley and Kayla.</p>
