      <h1>Report suggests Tottenham Hotspur could not afford Carlo Ancelotti as Mauricio Pochettino replacement</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham Hotspur have recently replaced Mauricio Pochettino with Jose Mourinho.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:45:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur got off to a winning start under Jose Mourinho this weekend. Tottenham defeated West Ham United 3-2 yesterday in the Portuguese manager’s first game in charge since taking over from Mauricio Pochettino. </p>
      <p>But it seems that Tottenham did have plenty of other options in mind for the job. One of those was Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea boss was reportedly in the frame for the role. However,<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10408576/carlo-ancelottis-transfer-fee-cost-him-tottenham-job/"> according to The Sun, </a>Tottenham could not afford to pay for the cost of releasing him from his contract with the Italian side. </p>

      <p>Ancelotti, who has been under fire for his performance as Napoli manager this season, would have been too expensive for Tottenham, especially considering the large fee they have had to pay Pochettino to terminate his employment at the club. </p>
      <p>Ancelotti would have also been a top option for Spurs but the early signs are positive regarding Mourinho’s appointment after the way in which Tottenham tore into West Ham in the first 60 minutes of yesterday’s game. </p>
      <p>Tottenham fans will just hope that continues and they do not end up wishing that Ancelotti had got the job instead. </p>
