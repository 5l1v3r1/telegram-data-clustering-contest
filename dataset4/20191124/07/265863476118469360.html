      <h1>Caitlyn Jenner Seems To Suggest Daughter Kylie Is Pregnant Again And Social Media Is Freaking Out!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:35:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:35</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>Is Kylie Jenner going to give her daughter, Stormi, a sibling much sooner than people thought? This is what fans of the Keeping Up with the Kardashians family are theorizing after her dad, transgender icon, Caitlyn Jenner seemed to let a hint slip.</p>
      <p>So what happened was that Caitlyn answered a question about the number of grandkids she has while on Iâ€™m a Celebrityâ€¦Get Me Out of Here and what she said confused fans.</p>
      <p>Now, people are seriously doing the math to figure out if there is a secret baby on its way, or maybe even two!</p>
      <p>During a chat with campmates Jacqueline Jossa, Adele Roberts, Kate Garraway, and Nadine Coyle, Caitlyn was asked how many grandkids she has since itâ€™s a well-known fact that the Kardashian-Jenner clan is a really big one, especially now that almost all sisters have popped out babies.</p>
      <p>But Caitlynâ€™s response doesnâ€™t seem to add up: â€˜20 in Decemberâ€¦they call me Boom Boom,â€™</p>
      <p>However, as far as the public knows, Caitlyn should have no more than 16 grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Granted, her son Brandon and his girlfriend Cayley Stoker announced they are expecting twins back in August so that will be 18 pretty soon!</p>
      <p>But thatâ€™s about it! What about the other two supposed grandkids?</p>
      <p>Social media users really want to know the answer to this question!</p>
      <p>Does Caitlyn know something more than the rest of us or did she make an honest mistake?</p>
      <p>Some KUWK fans think Kylie is pregnant again and keeping it a secret, just like she did with Stormi.</p>
      <p>Here are a few of the many comments on the matter: â€˜Is it just me or did Caitlin Jenner just say Kylies pregnant?ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤« #ImACeleb.â€™ / â€˜COMING UP THIS DECEMBER, 20â€³ -CAITLYN JENNERâ€¦.IS KYLIE PREGNANT???â€™ / â€˜Tryna work out how Caitlyn Jenner has 20 grandkids.â€™</p>
