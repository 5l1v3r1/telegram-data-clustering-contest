      <p>The Supreme Court on Sunday asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to produce two letters before the court by Monday morning showing proof of the Governor of Maharashtra inviting BJP to form the government and another letter showing Fadnavis staked claim to form the government.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court was hearing an urgent petition filed by the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance following Devendra Fadnavis's surprise swearing-in as the chief minister of Maharashtra on Saturday morning. The newly formed alliance moved the Supreme Court seeking to quash the governor's decision to swear-in Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court bench of Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna also isused notices to Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>The court has further said that it will pronounce its verdict on the petition on Monday morning at 10:30 am and till then Devendra Fadnavis and the BJP has some time to gather enough support.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Maharashtra government and Centre on Sena-NCP-Congress petition seeking a composite floor test to prove majority in the 288-member assembly.</p>
      <p>The court has also issued a notice to Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress told the Supreme Court that they have majority in the Maharashtra Assembly and Devendra Fadnavis does not have the required numbers to prove majority in the House that needs 145 as the majority mark.</p>
      <p>"If Devendra Fadnavis has numbers to prove majority, let him prove it on floor of House, else we have numbers to form government in Maharashtra," senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the combine, submitted before a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna.</p>
      <p>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said political parties do not have fundamental right to form the government and their plea can't be allowed.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for some BJP and Independent MLAs, said the plea filed by the combine should have been filed in Bombay High Court.</p>
