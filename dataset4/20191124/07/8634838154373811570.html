      <h1>Kuppet Warns CS Magoha Against Hurried KCSE Release</h1>

        <b>The Kenya Union of Post Primary Teachers (Kuppet) through their Chairman Omboko Milemba on Saturday, November 23, warned the Education CS Prof George Magoha against hurrying the release of the results of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking during an interview on <i>KTN News</i>, the chairman warned that the new trend of using the release of results as a standard of measurement could compromise the quality of marking. He added that releasing of results was not a race or a marathon. </p>
      <p>“We should not use the release of exams hurriedly as a means of setting standards for performance so that so that if Matiangi released after 30 days then Magoha has to release after 20 days to set a new record,” <b>Omboko Milemba </b>stated.</p>

      <p>He cautioned KNEC against overworking the examiners, noting that marking the exam papers for the 600,000 students and releasing the final results in such a short time would also overwork the examiners.</p>
      <p>“As we saw during the KCPE some of the examiners interviewed admitted to giving marks only for the sake of meeting targets. And therefore targets and timelines are replacing quality marking” Mr Omboko told journalists.</p>
      <p>He was responding to comments made by Education CS <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46522-magohas-promise-parents-kcpe-candidates-ahead-christmas-festivities">George Magoha</a> on Friday, November 22, who was giving updates on the ongoing KCSE exams. Prof Education confirmed that the results would be released before the festivities to give parents enough time to plan for their children’s education.</p>
      <p>“We shall go to Christmas after we’ve known how the children have performed. Definitely, so that you can again plan and not spend all your money enjoying Christmas,” Magoha told journalists.</p>
      <p>Just a day after the KCPE results were results on the November 19, examiners came out to complain over the stressful conditions under which they were forced to work while marking exams.</p>
      <p>Robert Kiunda, a teacher from Tusunini Primary school <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46355-teacher-drops-dead-while-marking-kcpe">collapsed while marking KCPE</a> exams was rushed to the hospital. He was later prounced dead on arrival.</p>
