      <h2>Australia’s treasurer said that bank board may be forced to resign</h2>

      <p>Westpac will close the payments system implicated in one of Australia’s biggest ever money laundering scandals and strip its executives of their short-term bonuses following an accountability review.</p>
      <p>Australia’s second largest bank by assets released its plan on Sunday in the face of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22589862-0cf1-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">immense pressure </a>after it emerged that Westpac approved payments that might have facilitated child exploitation by paedophiles.</p>
      <p>It followed critical comments from Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s treasurer, who hinted that members of senior management and the board may have to resign.</p>
      <p>Westpac’s board has been thrown into crisis since Australia’s financial crimes agency launched a legal case last week, alleging the bank <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3598cb7a-0b27-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">failed to report </a>international fund transactions worth more than A$11bn (US$7.5bn) between 2013 and 2019 in a timely fashion to the regulator, as required by law.</p>
      <p>Westpac breached money-laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws on 23m occasions, Austrac alleged in court documents.</p>
      <p>Austrac — formally the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre — is concerned that paedophiles may have been able to use Australia’s payments systems to direct and livestream the sexual abuse of children in south-east Asian nations.</p>
      <p>In its statement, Westpac said it would close down its international payments system LitePay, which had been linked to many of the suspicious transactions identified by Austrac. This system is cheaper and faster than many alternatives and sits outside the normal interbank Swift payment system.</p>
      <p>Lindsay Maxsted, Westpac chairman, reiterated his deep sorrow for the failings by the bank.</p>
      <p>““We are determined to urgently fix these issues and lift our standards to ensure our anti-money laundering and other financial crime processes are industry leading. As a major bank we play a critical role in helping law enforcement agencies prevent criminals from carrying out illegal activity.”</p>
      <p>The chairman added that “all or part of the grant of the 2019 short-term variable reward will be withheld for the full executive team and several members of the general management team subject to the assessment of accountability”.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Australia’s treasurer told the state broadcaster: “The Westpac board has to be accountable for this breach.</p>
      <p>“That will obviously involve decisions that they take about senior management, as well as the board. History shows us that these issues build a momentum of their own. Where boards start is not necessarily where boards finish.”</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg said the prudential regulator was investigating the money laundering breaches and had the power to disqualify executives if they had failed to uphold their duties.</p>
      <p>Westpac’s chairman is set to begin meetings with shareholders on Monday to discuss its response to the scandal ahead of the company’s annual meeting next month, where it could face a shareholder revolt over the re-election of several directors.</p>
