      <h1>Irish legend Daniel O'Donnell says he's ready for an affair</h1>
      <h2>The 57-year-old singer chats about his Corrie wish, his passion for quiz shows, and how meeting his wife tested his faith…</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sue Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Daniel O’Donnell has a confession. And, considering the performer’s clean-cut nature, it’s quite a sexy one.</p>
      <p>The popular Irish singer would love a cameo role in his favourite show, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> , but a simple walk-on part, sipping a pint in the Rovers Return, just won’t cut it….</p>
      <p>"I’d love an affair," he says with a chuckle.</p>
      <p>"I could have had an affair with Mavis (Rita’s famously dithery sidekick), but Mavis has been gone for ages.</p>
      <p>"Mary might be the only one left for me now, so maybe me and Mary in her campervan!</p>
      <p>"I could be the mechanic! I’d love a cameo – I’d sweep the streets, anything. It’s a great programme."</p>
      <p>We’re in the foyer of a central London hotel, where Daniel has just enjoyed a buffet breakfast in the dining room.</p>
      <p>He’s dressed casually, in smart blue chinos, a patterned shirt and a pair of blue suede shoes – a nice nod to his latest album release – Halfway To Paradise, a 3-CD/60-track set of his rock ’n’ roll recordings.</p>

      <p>There’s no entourage in tow and when he sits down his press officer trustingly leaves him to it. There’s not even a cup of coffee to keep him going.</p>
      <p>"I haven’t drunk tea or coffee for nearly 30 years," he says, by way of explanation.</p>
      <p>"I’ll have a Bailey’s coffee occasionally, that’ll be it, I rarely drink alcohol either. I’m not very showbusinessy.</p>
      <p>"Away from my work, life is as normal as can be."</p>
      <p>As we chat, that turns out to be something of an understatement.</p>
      <p>His secret fantasy of romancing florist Mary aside, Daniel’s life is about as far removed from pop star excess as it could possibly be.</p>
      <p>Home is County Donegal, just three miles from where he grew up, and he reveals that one of his favourite pastimes is attending the card sessions in his local village hall every Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to think of many other international mega stars who would spend their evenings playing whist, but Daniel insists nobody bats an eyelid.</p>

      <p>"Everybody knows me, this is where I was born and grew up," he explains. "I’ve gone for the past 50 years.</p>
      <p>"I love playing cards and we have great fun – we don’t take it seriously and we’re always laughing.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you can win a fiver or a tenner. We pay 5 Euros to go in and then the top prize is 15 Euros."</p>
      <p>When he’s not playing cards you might catch him on the golf course, but definitely not at tea-time.</p>
      <p>That’s reserved for his favourite television quiz shows.</p>
      <p>"Four o’clock Tipping Point, five o’clock The Chase," he enthuses.</p>
      <p>"My wife Majella will watch them, but not like I do. I’ll make a point of being home for them."</p>
      <p>Modest, unassuming and quietly spoken, a more everyday superstar it would be hard to find and, as he talks about his regular life, it’s easy to forget just how successful he actually is.</p>
      <p>A household name since the 1990s, he’s sold over 10 million records to date, been awarded an MBE, featured on This Is Your Life, and holds the record of being the only recording artist in history to chart at least one new album every year for 32 consecutive years, a record no other recording artist has come near, not even Madonna, Michael Jackson, U2 or the Rolling Stones.</p>
      <p>He tours most years, delighting fans around the world and his new album includes a ‘live in concert’ section, featuring medleys of songs by The Beatles and Cliff Richard.</p>
      <p>"This era of music is so popular – it’s the one genre every generation seems to enjoy," Daniel explains.</p>
      <p>"I suppose it’s not the music I’m associated with, but I’ve always included a bit of rock ’n’ roll in the live shows for years, so this wouldn’t be a great shock to the people who come to my shows."</p>
      <p>Daniel’s gentle charm and musical style – generally a mixture of Irish folk and country music, plus the 50s and 60s hits – has won him an army of loyal and slightly older fans.</p>

      <p>Yet ironically, as he gets older himself, he’s finding that his audiences are becoming younger.</p>
      <p>"I’ve known a lot of my fans for 30 years.</p>
      <p>"I know them personally because I always go out and meet them every night after the show, but a lot of the original fans who started out with me are not there anymore and there’s a sadness about that," he says reflectively.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I get letters saying they can’t come, but they have all the records and memories of when they went to the shows. There’s a saying that you know you’re getting old when the policemen look young, well in my case the fans are starting to get younger and I’m getting older!</p>
      <p>"A lot of people first came with their parents or grandparents and realised the show is different to what they imagined.</p>
      <p>"On the last tour a number of people came and said to me: 'We first came with our gran. Our gran just died and we came as a tribute to her.'"</p>

      <p>The fans’ devotion is certainly second to none.</p>
      <p>After mentioning once that he enjoyed Guylian chocolates he has been inundated with them ever since. And on the other end of the scale, one fan even paid for tickets for the two of them to have lunch together on Concorde.</p>
      <p>"She’d had a bad car accident and listened to my music during her recovery," Daniel says.</p>
      <p>"When she got better she wanted to go on Concorde and she asked me if I would go with her.</p>
      <p>"She booked the flights and apparently we had lunch over India; isn’t that something? It was incredible," he smiles.</p>
      <p>Daniel shares his home with Majella, his wife of 17 years.</p>
      <p>They met on holiday in Tenerife in a bar owned by his friends, who were Majella’s parents.</p>
      <p>Majella had two children, Siobhan and Michael, and had been married before, which Daniel initially found hard to come to terms with.</p>
      <p>"We were together for a while and then I thought it was going to be very awkward," he recalls.</p>
      <p>"I suppose that was because of my faith. Then I said to myself, “Well, if the God that I’m in touch with denies happiness, then it mustn’t be a great God."</p>
      <p>"I realised all the obstacles were of my making and we’ve never had any difficulties since, we’re very fortunate.</p>
      <p>"I got on with Siobhan and Michael very well from the beginning, we’ve never had an awkward period ever."</p>

      <p>Siobhan now has two children of her own, Olivia, four, and 18 month-old Archie.</p>
      <p>Daniel’s face lights up at the very mention of their names.</p>
      <p>"I speak to them via WhatsApp every day, we chat away," he smiles.</p>
      <p>"I never felt I was missing out by not having children of my own, Majella probably felt it more than me.</p>
      <p>"I’m a very accepting kind of person. I’m happy with what I have and I make the best of it.</p>
      <p>"I don’t strive for what I don’t have, I’m not always searching for the next thing."</p>
      <p>We think Daniel O’Donnell has absolutely everything he could possibly need – except possibly a romp with Mary – and it couldn’t have happened to a nicer chap. ■</p>
      <h3>How do you spend your Sunday?</h3>
      <h4>■ Hungover or fresh as a daisy?</h4>
      <p>Fresh as a daisy. I’m as good as I’ll be when I wake up! I don’t really drink and I wouldn’t want to be hungover.</p>
      <p>Even if we have friends over for dinner I wouldn’t have wine.</p>
      <p>I don’t have a taste for it, so I’m quite happy with water.</p>
      <p>What’s the point of me being hungover, when taking the drink does nothing for me anyway?</p>
      <h4>■ Gym or lazy day?</h4>
      <p>It’s not the gym any day, so I’d have to say lazy day, although sometimes if I’m home and really in the swing of things, I’ll play a wee bit of golf.</p>
      <p>I have a new trolley and all the gear so I look the bees’ knees, but I’m not a great player.</p>
      <p>Usually though we have a very quiet time on Sundays, so it will be very casual – whatever happens, just happens.</p>
      <p>When I’m not travelling I have very few plans.</p>
      <p>When I’m touring my whole life is structured, so the rest of the time it’s very loose.</p>
      <h4>■ Cooked breakfast or porridge?</h4>
      <p>I usually just have some muesli and yoghurt; this morning I only had an apple.</p>
      <p>I start off healthily with good intentions, but it goes downhill from there.</p>
      <p>I always say that a good start is half the work!</p>
      <p>We had a whole fry-up last week, but that’s not the usual.</p>

      <h4>■ Weekend away or Sunday brunch at home?</h4>
      <p>I quite like a Sunday lunch out in the local hotel or pub, but we often eat at home.</p>
      <p>My sister and brother live close and they’re in and out all the time and we often have friends over for a meal.</p>
      <p>Majella is a great cook, but I never feel hungry – I just eat because you have to eat to survive.</p>
      <p>I’ll probably have a bar of chocolate at some point, though. I eat it most days, unfortunately!</p>
      <h4>■ Lazy lie-in or up with the lark?</h4>
      <p>Singers are used to late nights, so they generally don’t get up too early.</p>
      <p>If I’m going to church then I’ll be up by 10 o’clock, but I normally go on Saturday evening instead.</p>
