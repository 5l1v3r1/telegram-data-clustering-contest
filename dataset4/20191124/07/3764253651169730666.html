      <p>An American musician, Jon Bon Jovi, has been bettering many lives with his wealth for years. In 2006, it was reported that he started The Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation which helps with poverty alleviation.</p>
      <p>Bored Panda reports that the same foundation also helped open the JBJ Soul Kitchen, a restaurant where people in need are not charged for the food they eat.</p>
      <p>While the first restaurant was launched in October 2011 around the Red Bank area in New Jersey, the second started operation in 2016 at Toms River.</p>

      <p>One of the main aims of the humanitarian project is to deal with food insecurity in a very humane way. It should, however, be noted that paying customers are also welcomed to the kitchen.</p>
      <p>At the restaurant, those who could pay for their meal are encouraged to donate $20 (N7,250) for the cause, while those who could not are implored to volunteer at the kitchen.</p>

      <p>JBJ Soul Kitchen has since its opening served out over 105,893 meals as 54% of the food were paid for through donations and 46% were given based on volunteering.</p>
      <p>The restaurant operates on a first-come-first-serve basis and no one could book a table in advance, though the poor are given preference.</p>

      <p>Another thing worthy of note is that on Monday, January 21, the restaurant gave free meals to US workers affected by the government shutdown.</p>
