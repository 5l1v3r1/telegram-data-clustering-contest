      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have said that this year’s contestants smell rather unpleasant.</p>
      <p>The presenters appeared on spin-off show Extra Camp, where they told hosts Joel Dommett and Emily Atack that the lack of a campfire has caused the pongy body odour problem.</p>
      <p>A gas cooker has been introduced into the camp this year.</p>

      <p>McPartlin said: “The difference is this year is, because we’ve got the gas stoves in there, there’s no smoke. They don’t stink as much.”</p>
      <p>Dommett then asked if they “smell of BO instead”, to which the presenters nodded and said yes.</p>
      <p>The comedian, who was in I’m A Celebrity in 2016, added: “I think they’re all smelling themselves going, ‘I really stink’, whereas usually you just smell fire.”</p>
      <p>McPartlin then revealed two of the celebrity campmates who possibly have the strongest aromas – Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>He said: “At the trial with Roman and Adele the other day, woo!</p>
      <p>“I am not saying what, one but one of them honked,” he said.</p>
      <p>Donnelly quipped: “One of them has got the nickname Cheese Fruit.”</p>
