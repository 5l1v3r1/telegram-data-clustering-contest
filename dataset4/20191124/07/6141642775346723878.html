      <p>The Prime Minister will unveil the Conservatives’ blueprint for government when he launches his party’s much-anticipated manifesto in the West Midlands on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson blurted out a key commitment earlier this week, but what other pledges are likely to feature in the document?</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Brexit</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Tories have been campaigning hard on their “Get Brexit Done” message – with the PM repeatedly telling voters he has an “oven ready” deal that can get the UK out of the EU by January 31.</p>
      <p>Brexit will therefore feature heavily in the manifesto – with the Tories’ pledge to drive their deal through the Commons within the next two months, and then begin negotiating the UK’s long-term relationship with Brussels.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– NHS</b>
      </p>

      <p>They have also said 50 million more appointments in GP surgeries will be created every year if they win a majority, and the party wants to train 500 more GPs each year from 2021-22 – bringing the total in training to 4,000.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Education</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has announced a three-year plan to increase state-school spending in England by £7.1 billion by 2022/23.</p>
      <p>The Tories have pledged that per pupil funding for secondary schools will be set at a minimum of £5,000 next year, and each primary school pupil will receive £4,000 by 2021-22.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Taxes</b>
      </p>

      <p>Mr Johnson has also shelved plans for a planned cut to corporation tax – claiming he would put £6 billion into public services instead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Social care</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservatives have said they will ensure that no-one has to sell their home to pay for the cost of their care in later life.</p>
      <p>Their manifesto will include a three-point plan for adult social care – including £5 billion in additional short-term funding – but the party will seek to work with other parties to find consensus on a longer term solution.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Housing</b>
      </p>

      <p>Foreign buyers will have to pay an additional 3% in stamp duty, no fault evictions will be outlawed, and long-term, fixed-rate mortgages requiring only 5% deposits will be made available. In addition, local, first-time buyers will be eligible for a 30% discount.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Crime</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories have pledged to recruit an additional 20,000 police officers with a national recruitment campaign to get more officers on the streets.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also wants to extend stop and search powers, make life mean life for child murderers, and spend £2.5 billion on improving prisons.</p>
