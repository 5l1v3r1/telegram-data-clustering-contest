      <p>After the correction of map on Friday, TDP general Secretary Nara Lokesh had through a tweet claimed it as a result of fight by party MP Jayadev Galla.</p>
      <p>"It is Chandrababu who put Amaravati in the world map. Kudos to TDP MP Jayadev for fighting in Lok Sabha to get Amaravati included in the map and got released by the Survey of India," Lokesh tweeted in Telugu.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, TDP MP Jayadev Galla had raised the issue in parliament by stating that the latest map issued by the Home Ministry did not have Amaravati in it.</p>
      <p>Later, G Kishan Reddy said the error regarding Amaravati missing from the political map released by the Home Ministry has been corrected.</p>
      <p>"Taking note of the issue of Amaravati missing from the map, raised by Hon'ble MPs of AP in the Parliament yesterday, I took up the matter with the concerned. The error has been rectified. Here is the revised map of India. @JayGalla @MithunReddyYSRC PC: Survey of India," said Reddy, tweeting a picture of the map.</p>
