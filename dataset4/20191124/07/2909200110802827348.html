      <h1>We are DEAD- Kwesi Pratt wails Bossman Asare’s ‘YES’ vote campaign</h1>

      <p>Kwesi Pratt, Managing Editor of the Insight newspaper, has expressed shock over the call by a Deputy Commissioner of the Electoral Commission (EC), Dr. Bossman Asare, for a “YES” vote in the upcoming referendum on whether or not political parties should take part in local level elections in the country.</p>
      <p>The veteran journalist is of the opinion that the action of the Dr Asare does not inspire confidence in the electorate, and predicts doom for the country if the Electoral Commission is not sanitized of persons like Dr Asare.</p>
      <p>“Two days ago, I heard a member of the Electoral Commission actually campaigning for a yes vote. And I was scandalised. Is this the Electoral Commission that is going to conduct the 2020 elections? Then we are dead. The Electoral Commission which is going to conduct the referendum, its deputy chairman has a position, and is publicly canvassing for that position. Are we not dead? Are we not dead?  This is shocking! Shocking! This is the type of Electoral Commission we have in Ghana today?  Publicly campaigning for a yes vote?” he submitted on the Good Morning Ghana show on Metro TV recently monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a></p>
      <p>Mr Pratt argued that since the Deputy  Commissioner is in the position  to manipulate  the outcome of the referendum, his campaign  for a ‘YES’ vote undermines the ability  of the EC to conduct free and fair elections, calling for a sanitization of the EC.</p>
      <p>“So what confidence would I have to go and vote in this election[ with EC as the referee]…What confidence do I have participating in this referendum  when I know that at least,  the vice chairman  of the Electoral Commission has a position, and  is in the position  to manipulate  the process? I am frightened. And this presents an opportunity for all the political parties including the NPP to be sincere about organising free and fair elections, to begin to agitate for sanitising the Electoral Commission . The Electoral Commission needs to be completely sanitised. What is this? Aaba!” he lamented.</p>
      <p>Mr Bossman Asare,  who is one of the Deputy Commissioners of the EC made the call for a ‘YES’ vote recently  in an media interview on the referendum.</p>
      <p>The 17th December 2019 referendum is on whether or not article 55(3) which bars political parties from participating in local government elections should be amended.</p>
