      <p><b>Pitch report, Day 3</b>: "The pitch is not going to make the slightest of difference to this Bangladesh team. India showed great application with the bat and that's why they were able to counter the movement off the seam. The pitch is very hard and is still very good to bat on, this match is going to finish pretty soon," reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Deep Dasgupta.</p>
      <p>Now, it will be interesting to see if Mahmudullah comes out to bat again alongside Mushfiqur Rahim (59*) and delay India win.</p>
      <p>After a terrific bowling effort from the India pacers on Day 2, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah good fight in the final session. But unfortunately, Mahmudullah had to retire hurt. Bangladesh lost Taijul Islam in the final over of the Day.</p>

        <b>Hello and welcome to the Live coverage of Day 3 of the Pink Ball Test between India and Bangladesh at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> in Kolkata<br/><br/>RECAP, DAY 2:</b>
      </p>
      <p>A sparkling century by Virat Kohli and Ishant Sharma's four wickets put India on the cusp of a big win over Bangladesh on just the second day of their maiden <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/day-night-Test">day-night Test</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The tourists were 152 for six at stumps in their second innings, still needing 89 runs to avoid an innings defeat in India's pink ball Test debut in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Kohli made 136 as India, who lead the two-match series 1-0, declared their innings on 347 for nine and then Ishant rattled the Bangladesh batting.</p>
      <p>Ishant struck early to leave Bangladesh tottering at 13 for four before Mushfiqur Rahim made an unbeaten 59 to take the five-day match to day three.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah, who retired hurt on 39 with what seemed a hamstring strain, put on 69 runs for the fifth wicket to offer some resistence against a persistent Indian pace attack.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur stayed on to complete his second half-century of the series with concussion substitute Taijul Hasan losing his wicket for 11 to paceman Umesh Yadav and umpires called for end of play.</p>
