      <h2>Irish heartthrob Danny O'Donoghue talks about saving a life, fulfilling his dreams, and flouting international flight laws - and explains why he believes 'something bad will happen to every one of us'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Jones</a></address>
      <p>The Script's Danny O'Donoghue splashed out £20,000 of his own money to give children with special needs a trip of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>Danny, who also was a judge on The Voice, reveals the biggest lessons he's learnt in life, in his own words.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Find what you love to do and do it until you die.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s true about everything in life. It can be gone in a click, so what are you going to do while you’re here? Are you going to complain?</p>
      <p>Nah, find who you love and hold them close to you.</p>
      <p>Stay in bed those extra five minutes, you might get in trouble, but if it feels like a magical moment make it stretch longer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You need to prepare yourself for the ‘what ifs’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It sounds terrible, but something bad will happen to every one of us. This year has been a bad one for me (Danny lost his mum and split from his fiancée, model Anne de Paulo) but I don’t want to wallow in self pity.</p>
      <p>The pain is still with me, but the heaviness isn’t there. I view life differently.</p>
      <p>If you’re around anyone who makes you unhappy, get them out of your life. Make every second count.</p>

      <p><b>My biggest fear is a life unlived, or a life unfulfilled</b> .</p>
      <p>For some people it’s to find love, or to procreate, but I want to be an Irish music legend. That dream will never stop.</p>
      <p>A child would be great too, though, what sane man wouldn’t want a child? A little mini me running around.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Music is in my blood.</b>
      </p>
      <p>My dad was a pianist, both my brothers are guitarists, my sister was a singer and mum was a dancer. Rhythm runs in the family.</p>
      <p>In my childhood bedroom I’d take CDs out of their cases, stick them to the wall and pretend they were my gold discs.</p>
      <p>I’m massively into the power of visualisation. I saw it, and now I have it.</p>

        <b>The most rock ’n’ roll thing to ever happen to me was getting £5,000 worth of excess baggage charges wiped at the airport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On top of that, I’d forgotten my passport, so they let me on an aeroplane with my social security card and my face on the front cover of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-issue-foundation">The Big Issue</a>.</p>
      <p>I was allowed onto the plane and to travel internationally. No, I won’t reveal the airline.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I do loads of f***ed up things, but I do loads of good things too.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m just hoping when I get to the end my gold is just a little bit more than my silver. It’s all about balance.</p>

        <b>I couldn’t give a f*** about money.</b>
      </p>
      <p>My mum never had the love for money either. I’m from a place where happiness is valued over earnings.</p>
      <p>With my first big pay cheque I spent £20,000 taking 300 special needs kids from around Ireland to a therapeutic centre.</p>

        <b>Traditions are important to me.</b>
      </p>
      <p>My mum used to cook 364 days a year, so Christmas Day was her day off and my dad made the food. We always had steak and potatoes, and he would always burn something.</p>
      <p>Now they’ve both passed away I’ll spend the day at the local children’s hospital, as it feels a bit weird in our old house. I’ll stick to the tradition and cook steak for my siblings afterwards, just as my dad did for us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I’m no hero, but one of the bravest things I’ve ever done was to pull a woman out of a car after an accident.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was on the way to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/v-festival">V Festival</a> with the band and she spun around fast with the car flipping in the air.</p>
      <p>The coach hadn’t even slowed down and the doors were open, I was terrified.</p>
      <p>Her door wouldn’t open, so we ran around to the other side; there was smoke coming out of the engine, but we cranked the other door open and dragged her to the side of the road.</p>
      <p>She was in shock, but said in the ambulance, ‘Did I get rescued by The Script?’</p>

        <b>I’ve been boxing for five years, but I’ve done Muay Thai for a year now.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>I started doing it after my break up when I went down a hole. I get depression and anxiety, and mix all that up with paparazzi and fame, it’s tough.</p>
      <p>My diet sucked, I was drinking, smoking and I just needed something to focus me again.</p>
      <p>I believe I needed something in my life to get me back on course, and Muay Thai is absolutely breathtaking.</p>
      <p>I usually run away from problems, but it’s showed me there is nothing to fear but fear itself.</p>
      <p>Money, drink and drugs don’t fill those holes inside of you. Silence will kill you, the best thing you can do is talk about all of these things and find a sense of routine.</p>
      <p>I love the camaraderie in the gym too. Most of the guys in there suffer from the same things as me, but they’re all walking around like burly men.</p>
      <p>I feel powerful knowing I can say I feel weak sometimes.</p>
      <p>I’ve admitted to guys in the gym that I bawled my eyes out over the death of my mother, and they said they had done the same.</p>
      <p>I feel like I have a lean body, a lean mind and a lean spirit around me now. It’s been incredible for my mental health.</p>
