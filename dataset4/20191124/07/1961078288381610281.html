      <h1>‘Saturday Night Live’: Will Ferrell Leads a Celebrity Extravaganza</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:31:07+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:31</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Itzkoff</a></address>
      <p>Why even have a cast? This weekend’s episode of “Saturday Night Live” offered no shortage of celebrity guests sending up themselves and other famous figures, starting with the show’s opening sketch, which once again featured Alec Baldwin as President Trump.</p>
      <p>Standing on the White House lawn, Baldwin fielded questions, over the sound of a whirring helicopter, from reporters like the one played by Kyle Mooney, who asked, “Can you comment on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/impeachment-briefing-sondland.html?searchResultPosition=3&amp;module=inline">Ambassador Sondland’s damning testimony</a> about your legal dealings with Ukraine?”</p>
      <p>Baldwin answered, “I can’t really hear you that good, because of this lousy chopper behind me. But it sounds like you said Sondland’s testimony completely exonerated me.” Reading from notes written with what he said was “the biggest, fattest, blackest Magic Marker I could find,” Baldwin recited what he said was a conversation between himself and the ambassador:</p>
      <p>“He says, ‘What do you want?’ I answer, ‘Two large pies, extra cheese, extra sauce.’ No, wait, that’s a different phone call. Oh here it is. I said to Sondland, ‘I want nothing, no quid pro quo, bro. See, it’s right here in black licorice, case closed.”</p>

      <p>Though the reporters continued to press him on Sondland’s testimony, Baldwin said, “I still told him no quid pro quo at least once. So any quid that I get after that, that’s on them. So that’s how it works, see, O.K. It’s just like when you meet a girl and you say, ‘If you’re a cop, you gotta tell me.’”</p>
      <p>The sketch was joined by Will Ferrell, this week’s host, who played Sondland. After a bit of cross talk, Baldwin acknowledged him: “It’s so great to finally meet you for the first time, by the way,” he told Ferrell.</p>
      <p>Ferrell acted as if he got the message: “Keep the quid pro quo on the low-low,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ferrell then told the crowd, “I just want to go on the record and say you guys need to lay off my boy. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-20-19/h_f97dae04e836c65e067b75c11b77611f">Everybody loves his ass</a>. Ukraine, Russia, they’ll do anything for this man. I know — I asked.”</p>
      <h3>Democratic Debate Parody of the Week</h3>
      <p>The “S.N.L.” lampoon of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-women-pete-buttigieg.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline">Wednesday night’s Democratic debate</a> was another smorgasbord of political impersonations, so we’ll just cut to the chase and run down the best players and their most memorable lines:</p>
      <p>Kate McKinnon as Elizabeth Warren: “I know in past debates, I’ve been accused of being overambitious. I got mom-hosting-Thanksgiving energy. I’m a little overwhelmed because I thought 10 people were coming and now there’s 30 million. But I promise dinner will be ready if you just get out of the kitchen and stop asking questions.”</p>
      <p>Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris: “Tonight, I’m not going to worry about the polling numbers. I’m just going to have fun and see if I can have some viral moments. Mama needs a GIF. Gonna tell my kids, this was Michelle Obama.”</p>
      <p>Colin Jost as Pete Buttigieg: Asked why he was polling so poorly with black voters, Jost gestured to himself and answered, “Maybe just ‘cause of, like, this.”</p>
      <p>Larry David as Bernie Sanders: “I did have a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack. So you oughta know by now, I’m doing better than ever. Doctors were surprised I made it. And I’m very proud of the fact that I was the first heart attack patient to show up to the emergency room in a city bus.”</p>
      <p>Rachel Dratch as Amy Klobuchar: “I know some of you think I’m shaking because I’m nervous, but this is just my signature quivering bang. It’s my Spidey sense that tingles whenever we need a moderate to say, ‘Girl, we can’t pay for that.’”</p>
      <p>Woody Harrelson as Joe Biden: “I just want everyone to know, America, I see you. And I see the faces you all make when I talk. You’re scared. Scared I’ll say something off-color. Or even worse, on color. What I want you to know is, you should be scared. ‘Cause I’m always one second away from calling Cory Booker ‘Barack.’”</p>
      <p>Will Ferrell as Tom Steyer: Told that he would have to blink eventually, Ferrell answered, “Oh no, I do not, and I will not.”</p>
      <p>Fred Armisen as Michael Bloomberg: Asked if his presence at the debate meant he was running for president, Armisen answered, “Maybe, maybe not. I’d be hard to beat. I’d like to see those Trump supporters come up with a conspiracy theory about a Jewish billionaire with his own media company. Good luck making that stick.”</p>
      <h3>Ryan Reynolds Cameo of the Week</h3>
      <p>The celebrity extravaganza continued with Ferrell’s extremely charming opening monologue, where he noticed that Ryan Reynolds was sitting in the audience, and was driven to distraction by his own delight at seeing the “Deadpool” star. (“You gotta stop looking at me,” Reynolds told him. “No way, it’s too late,” Ferrell answered. “I’m locked in. It’s like the rest of the audience has disappeared.”)</p>
      <p>The guest host stumbled over his lines and slipped into a terrible impression of Tracy Morgan, his old “S.N.L.” co-star, which Ferrell said he did whenever he got nervous. Naturally there was only one way to end the bit: with an appearance from the real Tracy Morgan.</p>
      <h3>Holiday Humor of the Week</h3>
      <p>It was by no means <a href="https://twitter.com/backaftathis/status/1065478406521974784?lang=en">the most disgusting “</a>S.N.L.” sketch that Will Ferrell has performed at a dinner table, but the host was back, along with Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, in a segment about an early Thanksgiving dinner set in the 1600s. Melissa Villaseñor played Pocahontas and Beck Bennett played John Smith, while Ferrell was cast as Villaseñor’s disapproving grandfather, who spent the meal complaining about the new settlers in his country: “We need a wall,” Ferrell said. “I heard those illegal settlers are coming over here with their diseases and guns, and we need to protect our borders.”</p>
      <p>Asked where he had heard this, Ferrell answered, “Fox.” Villaseñor told him, “Grandpa, you’ve got to stop talking to that crazy old fox.” Ferrell replied, “He knows what’s up. He makes a lot more sense than that lying peacock you talk to.”</p>
      <h3>Weekend Update Jokes of the Week</h3>
      <p>Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the impeachment inquiry, taking particular aim at Representative Devin Nunes and the witness Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union.</p>
      <p>Jost:</p>
      <blockquote>Testimony in the impeachment hearing concluded in the House this week and now the debate will shift to your house for Thanksgiving. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/nunes-vienna-trip-ukrainian-prosecutor-biden/index.html">It was reported last night</a> that one of the stars of the hearing, Congressman Devin Nunes, who has resting SpongeBob face, allegedly met in secret last year with a Ukrainian prosecutor to get dirt on the Bidens. So the guy who’s supposed to be investigating Trump helped him do the crime. Nunes is so deep in this, he’s basically living in a pineapple under the sea. Now, the source of this theory about Nunes is a little unreliable, so I probably shouldn’t have even mentioned it on TV. But hey, that never stopped Devin Nunes. Remember when he said this about Democrats? [Video of Nunes saying, “They got caught trying to obtain nude photos of President Trump from Russian pranksters.”] Yeah, somehow I don’t think Russia has a lot of pranksters. It’s not like when the president of Russia poisons a journalist he jumps out and yells, “You just got Putin’d.”</blockquote>
      <p>Che:</p>
      <blockquote>I just love how much fun Sondland was having. I mean, look at his face. He’s in court for one of the biggest political scandals of all time, and he looked like he just took a molly suppository. How is he so relaxed in court? Meanwhile, every time a cop asks me my name, I get so nervous I can barely say “Kenan Thompson.”</blockquote>
