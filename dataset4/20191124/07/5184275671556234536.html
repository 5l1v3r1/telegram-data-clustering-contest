        </p>
        <p>Panipat starring Arjun Kapoor, Kriti Sanon and Sanjay Dutt has managed to create a decent buzz around it. The makers are only adding more to it as they released the first song from the album named Mard Maratha. While the song is a celebratory number it features a full ensemble in it with the three leads.</p>
        <p>Composed by well-known music composer duo Ajay-Atul, the song is sung by the two. High on vocals and backed by traditional instruments the number has its own pace with high and soothing low notes. While Arjun can be seen on the throne, we get to see Kriti dancing for a bit conveying a message to her husband and warrior Sadashiv Rao. The song is shot on a big scale with a grand set and some good cinematography. The back dancers in synch are a standard director Ashutosh Gowarikar scene to watch.</p>
