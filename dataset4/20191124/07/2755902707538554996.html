        <b>Trevor Noah views on marriage spark outrage,South Africans in disbelief</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the world’s top funny men and South African,<a href="https://iharare.com/trevor-noah-under-fire/"> Trevor Noah</a> has had a very busy November. From being the first ever African to sell out the Madison Square gardens. To being nominated for a Grammy, Trevor was also named the fourth richest comedian in the world.Trevor is now back in the news for after his comments on love and marriage while on the Howard Stern show left some people with a sour taste in their mouths and baffled.</p>
      <p>The South African funny man recently appeared on the Howard Stern show where he gave some thought-provoking advice on love and marriage. Trevor boldly proclaimed that people should get married but should not cohabitate. The comment even left Howard Stern speechless. During the interview, Howard had hinted that he is an advocate to living together before marriage to which Trevor chips in :</p>
      <aside>“I am a big advocate for not living together ever even if you are married”.</aside>
      <p>He (Trevor) went on to support his stance on not living together ever by suggesting that that’s the reason there is a high rate of divorce because people are suffocating each other’s spaces.</p>
      <p>Trevor prides himself in his heritage and being South African and he speaks fluent Xhosa. With his mother being a Xhosa, the news might be received negatively by people back in South Africa where growing up, one is taught about the importance of family and living together. Apart from the comments, Trevor also shed his stance on love and also hinted that he is single and just waiting to meet someone. His down to earth approach to love might have won him a few more admirers but his stance on not living together after marriage might have lost his more admirers too.</p>
      <p>Despite all the hype and talk, Trevor Noah has become a darling to many people across the world and not just South Africa. His star keeps on shining. As a comedian, one would argue that his comment on marriage was a joke. Guess we will only know when he finally gets married. If he does.</p>
