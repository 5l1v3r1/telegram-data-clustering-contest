      <p>The Reds made the trip to Selhurst Park knowing victory would crank up the pressure on their rivals, on what proved to be another nerve-wracking afternoon.</p>
      <p>A forgettable first half saw the two sides head in goalless, but Mane found the net early in the second, finishing well.</p>
      <p>Wilfried Zaha looked to have earned a point for Palace, but <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>‘s strike with five minutes left clinched the win for Liverpool.</p>

      <p>Mane <b>(7.7)</b> received the highest average rating, as he again proved to be Liverpool’s most potent attacking player.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese took his goal well and was a constant menace to the Palace defence, working his socks off at the same time.</p>
      <p>This is Anfield’s <b>Henry Jackson</b> hailed Mane as “indispensable” to the Reds at the moment, while <b>Matt Maltby</b> of the <i>Mirror</i> felt he “stretched Palace’s defence all game.”</p>
      <p>Van Dijk <b>(7.3)</b> was excellent at the heart of the defence – he was arguably unfortunate not to receive a higher average than Mane.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old’s aerial prowess was crucial, according to the <i>Echo</i>‘s <b>Ian Doyle</b>, with FotMob highlighting that he won five duels in the air.</p>

      <p>In third place was Firmino <b>(7.2)</b>, who actually didn’t play particularly well, but scored the huge winning goal.</p>
      <p><b>Jackson</b> believes Liverpool’s No.9’s strike could be a “huge moment in the title race”, as he outlined his importance.</p>
      <p>On a day when a number of Reds players struggled to hit top gear, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> <b>(5.9)</b> took home the wooden spoon.</p>
      <p><b>Maltby</b> thought he “cut a lonely figure in attack”, struggling to enjoy the same level of influence as he does in midfield.</p>
      <p>There is little time to rest for Liverpool, who host Napoli in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> on Wednesday evening.</p>
