        <b>What happens when Scarlett Johansson's ex-husband Ryan Reynolds meets her future husband Colin Jost? Well, a lot of sexual puns!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest episode of Saturday Night Live just got a little more star-studded, funnier and, we guess, a little awkward courtesy, Ryan Reynolds’ super-delightful banter with comedian Colin Jost. The Deadpool star took everyone by a surprise after he bumped in as a guest for Saturday Night Live, amid Ferrell’s fifth time hosting after he left the cast in the year 2002. The Marvel actor looked dashing as ever in a striped shirt an orange vest. “Guy Who Knows The Owner,” is how the host introduced Ryan. LOL!  (ALSO READ -<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/hollywood/hollywood_news/deadpool-star-ryan-reynolds-in-love-with-indian-culture-and-cinema-says-i-would-love-to-visit-india/5dcfa0b687fb571eff7e3f18"> Deadpool Star Ryan Reynolds In Love With Indian Culture And Cinema, Says 'I Would Love To Visit India'</a>)</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, host Colin Jost is engaged to Scarlett Johansson, who upon a time was married to Ryan Reynolds. However, the two parted ways and got divorced after three years in 2011. While one could expect a lot of awkwardness among Ryan and Colin due to this reason, it was the former’s sexual puns that sent everyone into a tizzy.  “It’s tight to be here, CoJo — I was in the areola,” Ryan said as Colin tried to keep a straight face. “This Thanksgiving, if you want to move out the friend zone and into her end zone, pay her a compliment — like ‘nice cooking’,” Ryan added. “Remember — class leads to a–!” LOL!</p>

      <p>This, unsurprisingly, sent netizens into a frenzy and they couldn’t stop expressing their excitement on seeing ex Johansson bonding with future Johansson. “Just realized Ryan Reynolds’s ex-wife, Scarlett Johansson is now Colin Jost’s current fiance,” wrote a fan while another yelled, not literally, “RYAN REYNOLDS USED TO BE MARRIED TO SCARJO AND NOW JOST IS ENGAGED TO HER WHAT IS THE BACKSTAGE DYNAMIC I NEED TO KNOW #SNL.” “Is this awkward? Ryan Reynolds is ScarJo’s ex-husband. And sitting there with Colin Jost. #snl” tweeted another.</p>

      <p>Though, wouldn’t it have been more exciting if we also had Black Lively and Scarlett Johansson in the audiences. *winks*<br/><br/><i>image source: twitter/nbcsnl, instagram/scarlettjohansson_xo</i></p>
