      <p>A woman's phobia of cats is so bad she can't face walking past the pet food aisle when out shopping in case she glances at a picture on tinned cat food.</p>
      <p>Jean Diffenthal, 55, panics if she comes anywhere near a cat and even avoids watching certain TV programmes or adverts in case one pops up.</p>
      <p>Grandmother-of-two Jean pays her relatives to put their cats in a cattery when she goes home to visit to avoid seeing them.</p>
      <p>Anytime she spots one she 'freaks out' and her heart starts racing - AND even the word ‘cat’ gives her the ‘heebie jeebies’.</p>
      <p>Jean struggled to buy her house in Reading, Berkshire, because she refused to view a property with a cat in it or any kind of cat ornaments.</p>

      <p>She has never even touched a cat and even singing any nursery rhymes mentioning the animal is off the table, she claims.</p>
      <p>The phobia has gradually gotten worse over the years and makes everyday tasks difficult for Jean - she is desperate to find some help and overcome her fear.</p>
      <p>Jean, who is currently unemployed, said: “I can’t be in the same room as a cat or even look at this without freaking out.</p>
      <p>“I’ll avoid the pet aisle at the supermarket so I don’t seem imagines of cats on tinned food.</p>
      <p>“I’m from South Africa originally and when I got home to visit family I’ll pay to put their cats in the cattery while I’m there.</p>

      <p>"I've got a tiny garden, but I've got about six cat repellents out there just in case.</p>
      <p>“I feel my heart racing and I break out into a sweat whenever I spot one – even saying the word gives me the heebie jeebies.</p>
      <p>“I just tell people I’m allergic now to save time explaining the phobia because people just don’t understand it.”</p>

      <p>Jean, who is originally from Durban, South Africa, moved to Reading, Berks., 16 years ago, and has had a fear of domestic house cats for as long as she can remember.</p>
      <p>She lives at home with her husband Russell and they have to plan ahead before visiting friends and family in case they have a cat.</p>
      <p>Jean has even visited a hypnotherapist, but nothing has helped her overcome her fear.</p>
      <p>"People always asked if it began because of some traumatic experience but it didn’t," Jean said.</p>
      <p>“For as long as I can remember I’ve been scared of them and I have no idea why. It’s something about their eyes and they're agile - they quietly dart about.</p>
      <h3>'I don't know where they'll be hiding'</h3>
      <p>“I’ve never touched a cat because they look like they’re all skin and bone which freaks me out. Although it’s just domestic cats – I don’t have problem with lions or tigers.</p>
      <p>"I think moving from South Africa to the UK has made it worse because there are so many more pet cats here.</p>
      <p>"They're often out roaming around and I don't know where they'll be hiding which terrifies me."</p>
      <p>Even choosing a property in the UK was difficult for Jean.</p>
      <p>She said: "Buying a house in the UK was so difficult because of my deep-rooted fear of cats. I couldn't go in a view some of them because they had pet cats.</p>
      <p>"Even pictures of cats or cat ornaments - if they had anything cat-related I couldn't go in. Most people don't really realise how prevalent they are in everyday life but I can easily spot them."</p>

      <p>The phobia has gradually deteriorated over the years and it now affects Jean day-to-day life.</p>
      <p>Even simple tasks like watching TV or spending time with her grandchildren, three-year-old twins Leyla and Renelan, has become a challenge for Jean.</p>
      <p>She said: “I loved watching reality shows with my daughter Bianca but one of them had a resident cat on the show.</p>
      <p>“I had to look away every time it was on screen and wait until it was gone and safe to look again.</p>
      <p>"There so many adverts where they pop up and it sends my heart rate through the roof. I get sweaty when I see them and physically run away if I spot one.</p>
      <p>"It's also difficult for my poor husband and we have to make sure there are no cats around when we go to places together.</p>
      <p>"Russell's mum passed away recently but before, when I went to visit her in the care home, I had to get Russell to remove a cat picture off the wall in her room before I could go in.</p>
      <p>"I make him ask his friends and colleagues if they have one in the house before we go.</p>
      <p>"I ask my friends to lock them away in a different room, but on one occasion I heard one scratching at the door and I couldn't stay."</p>
      <p>Jean went to see a hypnotherapist five year ago to try and overcome her debilitating fear of cats.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, she found the treatment ineffective and is still hoping to find hope and overcome her fear once and for all.</p>
      <p>She said: "The therapist told me to pinch my fingers and think of something good whenever I saw a cat.</p>
      <p>"But I couldn't look or be near one long enough to try it. It's really hard to talk about it because no one really understands.</p>
      <p>"Although people are scared of things like spiders, which are tiny, so why is are cats any stranger. It's not like fearing a type of caterpillar that you seen once a month - I have to face them most days.</p>
      <p>"I hope sharing my story with show people that's not that unusual. It's really affecting everything I do and I want to volunteer for elderly care but often they'll have pet cats in the house."</p>
