      <p>Kelowna is going the wrong way when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>The city has set a target of reducing GHG emissions by four per cent compared to 2007 levels by 2023.</p>
      <p>However, in 2017, the last year data is available, emissions actually increased by nearly six per cent.</p>
      <p>Figures in a report for council on the city's Community Climate Action Plan shows GHG emissions since 2007 have fluctuated wildly. In 2010, the city had reduced its output by 4.7 per cent, while in 2016, that number had dropped to 2.8 per cent.</p>
