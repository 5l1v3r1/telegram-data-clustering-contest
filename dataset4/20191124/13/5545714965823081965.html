      <p>Anyone craving some real old-school fighting action might want to check out '80s classic <i>Yie Ar Kung-Fu,</i> which is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, courtesy of publisher Hamster's Arcade Archive range.<br/><br/>Released in the arcades back in 1985, before being ported to numerous home computers, Konami's one-on-one fighter is one of the founding fathers of the fighting game genre that we, know, love and incessantly argue about today. Players step into the shoes of a kung-fu master before facing off against a series of martial arts experts, some of whom are armed with typical combat weapons such as bo staff, nunchaku, tonfa, or shuriken. You can check out a video of the game in action below, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KWRveg_gJs">from YouTuber DVG</a>.</p>

      <p>Our hero is armed with a selection of high, mid, low and jumping attacks, making gameplay surprisingly deep for the time period, even if it is a little clunky by today's standards. <i>Yie Ar Kung-Fu</i> also features some delightfully simplistic-but-colourful sprites and stages. While superseded by the fighting games that would follow in its wake, such as <i>International Karate +,</i> I personally think that its retro charm and varied opponents makes <i>Yie Ar Kung-Fu</i> is more fun to play than some of its successors, including the original <i>Street Fighter.<br/><br/>Yie Ar Kung Fu </i>is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.</p>
