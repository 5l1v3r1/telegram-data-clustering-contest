      <h1>Tennis: Federer, Zverev play in front of over 42,000</h1>

      <p>Roger Federer may not be playing at the new-look Davis Cup in Spain but the 38-year-old was still pulling in the crowds when he met Alexander Zverev in an exhibition match in Mexico City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>According to organisers, 42,517 spectators packed into the specially-erected arena in the Plaza de Toros to watch Federer beat the German 6-3,4-6,6-2.</p>
      <p>“You are an incredible audience, your support has given me goosebumps, I do not have enough words to thank you,” said Federer.</p>
      <p>The attendance has not been ratified by the International Tennis Federation so it does not stand as an official record.</p>
      <p>In July 2010, 35,681 spectators gathered at the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels to watch an exhibition match between Kim Clijsters and Serena Williams.</p>
      <p>The biggest court for an official match is the Arthur Ashe at Flushing Meadows in New York, home of the US Open, which can seat around 23,000.</p>
      <p>The Mexico match was the fourth of a highly lucrative five-stop Latin American tour for Federer who is set to earn $10 million (9 million euros) — three times as much as he has earned this season, according to Swiss daily Le Temps.</p>
      <p>After a controversial first step on Tuesday in Chile, a country where the sport has come to a grinding halt for a month because of the social crisis that has left 23 dead and more than 2,000 injured, the roadshow moved to Buenos Aires on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Friday’s planned match in Colombia was cancelled because of the curfew in Bogota after violence following massive demonstrations against President Ivan Duque.</p>
      <p>The tour ends with the two players meeting again in Ecuadorian capital later on Sunday.</p>
