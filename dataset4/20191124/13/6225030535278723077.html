      <p>Irish champion jockey Donnacha O'Brien announced on Sunday that he has retired from the saddle to focus on a training career.</p>
      <p>O'Brien, 21, the youngest son of trainer Aidan O'Brien, revealed his news via Twitter. He follows a path similar to his older brother, Joseph, who took out his trainer's license in 2016 after a successful seven-year career as a jockey and recently won the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf with Iridessa.</p>
      <p>Donnacha O'Brien took out his jockey's license in 2014, and has won the flat championship in Ireland in 2018 and 2019. He also won his first Classic -- and three in all -- last year when he piloted Saxon Warrior to victory in the Qipco 2,000 Guineas. He later won the Investec Oaks on Forever Together and the Irish Derby with Latrobe, who was trained by his older brother.</p>
      <p>He has won 10 Group 1 races, his most recent coming on Magical in the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October.</p>
      <p>Hopes are already high for Donnacha O'Brien as a trainer, too. European book maker Paddy Power made him 11-8 to train a group winner in 2020; 12-1 for a Group 1 winner; and 33-1 for a classic winner, according to the Racing Post.</p>
