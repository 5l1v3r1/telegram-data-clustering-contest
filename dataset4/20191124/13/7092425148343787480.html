        <b>Cinema bosses have axed Blue Story from Vue venues in the wake of the riots at Birmingham Star City last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Families were left terrified after machete-wielding thugs stormed the popular leisure and <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/blue-story-banned-vue-cinemas-20949749">entertainment</a> complex in Birmingham in the UK.</p>
      <p>Star City was on lockdown last night after a massive brawl involving 100 people broke out.</p>
      <p>Horrified customers were evacuated as the violence erupted, with cops also being attacked.</p>
      <p>Now a recorded message on Vue's answerphone reveals how the movie will no longer be screened at its venues, BirminghamLive reports.</p>
      <p>Many families were visiting Star City for the opening of Frozen II at the time of the unrest, just after 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>The message from Vue said: "We regret that we will no longer be screening the film Blue Story at any of our venues.</p>

      <p>"Should you have a booking for this film, please say cancellation when prompted and a member of our team will be with you shortly to assist you with your booking."</p>

      <p>Blue Story, rated 15, was released on more than 300 screens nationwide on Friday.</p>
      <p>The gritty gangland drama, directed by Andrew Onwubolu, aka rapper Rapman, tells the story of two boys from rival postcodes.</p>
