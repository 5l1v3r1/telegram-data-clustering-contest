      <p>The Defence Secretary has dismissed claims that there are plans to shrink the British Army, saying the report in The Sunday Times is “nonsense”.</p>

      <p>Ben Wallace took to Twitter to clear the record, following an article which said the Army will be “slashed” in size.</p>
      <blockquote>“For the record: there are no plans to shrink the Army.</blockquote>
      <p>“In fact, my direction to the Army has been to improve recruiting and retention levels.”</p>
      <p>“This story is nonsense,” Mr Wallace said.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times reported there were discussions in place to reduce the Army’s numbers to between 60,000 and 65,000.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Conservatives' manifesto launch, Mr Wallace said: “In the manifesto there will be new policies to help.”</p>
      <p>It’s believed the Army needs 10,000 recruits a year to maintain a front-line strength of 82,500.</p>
      <p>But recruitment is falling below its targets - last year the outsourcing company Capita only managed to bring in fewer than one in 10 of the recruits the Army needed.</p>
