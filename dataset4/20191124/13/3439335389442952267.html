        <b>8:45 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After trading defensive stands, Hawaii takes over at its 12 leading 14-11 with 5:28 to play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8:30 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quarterback Ryan Agnew scores on a 5-yard scramble/keeper and then spins his way into the end zone for the ensuing two-point conversion to close the Aztecs to 14-11 with 12:58 to play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8:05 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fred Holly takes the handoff from Chevan Cordeiro and sprints around left end for a 11-yard touchdown. The Warriors now lead 14-3 with 5:15 remaining in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7:55 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chevan Cordeiro is UH’s QB now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7:50 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Warriors hold, but get the ball back at their 4 — the fourth time they are starting a drive inside the 10.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7:45 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Warriors go three-and-out — four, actually, if you count the opening holding penalty — to open the second half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7:25 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>UH leads 7-3</b> at the half.</p>
      <p>The Warriors will receive the kickoff to open the second half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7:20 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Aztecs close to <b>7-3</b> on Matt Araiza’s 27-yard field goal with 18 seconds left in the half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7:10 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Aztecs regain possession when Cole McDonald’s pass deflects off slotback Cedric Byrd and picked off by Luq Barcoo at midfield.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another stop for the Warriors. They take over for the third time, leading 7-0 with the ball at the 7 with 4:16 remaining in the first half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6:45 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two SDSU drives, two UH stops.</p>
      <p>The Warriors take over at their 2, leading 7-0 with 13:31 left in the first half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6:40 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Warriors take a 7-0 lead into the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The Warriors have had the ball only once, but they kept possession for 8 minutes, 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>The Aztecs will have a first-and-20 from their 49 when the second quarter begins.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6:22 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cole McDonald lofts an 8-yard scoring pass to Jason-Matthew Sharsh in the right corner of the end zone to cap a 15-play, 92-yard drive and give the Warriors a <b>7-0 lead</b> with 3:43 left in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6:15 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hawaii holds, takes over at its 8.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6:05 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hawaii wins the toss, elects to defer choice until the second half. SDSU will receive the kickoff to start the game.</p>
      <p>And the Warriors are in the all-black uniforms.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pregame</b>
      </p>
      <p>Can Hawaii run against the Mountain West’s best defense?</p>
      <p>Will the Froot Train make an appearance?</p>
      <p>Answer coming up in five minutes.</p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>In the biggest game since joining the Mountain West in 2012, the Warriors play host to San Diego State at Aloha Stadium.</p>
      <p>A crowd of about 25,000 is expected.</p>
      <p>The Aztecs already have claimed at least a share of the West Division title. But tonight’s winner will get to represent the West in the Dec. 7 Mountain West title game.</p>
      <p>The Warriors have one of the nation’s top passing attacks. The Aztecs have one of the best defenses.</p>
