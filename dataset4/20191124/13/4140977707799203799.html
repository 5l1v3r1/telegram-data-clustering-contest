          <p>After a hectic, congested, gruelling, tedious and rigorous 10 days off cricket, the marquee T20 league gets ready to bring down the curtains on its sojourn with Maratha Arabians and Deccan Gladiators taking on each other in the showpiece final. As the two most sublime sides in the league get ready to take on each other today, this is a contest which promises to be a cracker of an affair, a match where either side will be looking to throw the kitchen sink and more at their opponents as they look to get their hands around the trophy.</p>
          <p>Sitting atop of the points tally after the super League stage with the six wins from four encounters, Maratha Arabians ended up cantering their way into the summit clash after defeating Qalandars n the first qualifier. It’s been a succulent and resplendent season for the side, one where the side’s consummate success has been well documented to make for a gripping narrative.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere after finishing third in the Super League round, Deccan Gladiators had to take the arduous route to ascertaining themselves of a spot in today’s final affair. The side managed to win their first eliminator before going through in their second eliminator as well yesterday as they got the better of Qalandars by 12 runs.</p>
                <p>Putting on 116 on the scoreboard while batting first, the side limited their opponents to 102, a performance which will imbue in them the much needed momentum as they look to cruise past Maratha Arabians. This is a side they know they can’t afford to commit any errors other, a match where they’ll be looking to emulate their rousing performances from Saturday.</p>
