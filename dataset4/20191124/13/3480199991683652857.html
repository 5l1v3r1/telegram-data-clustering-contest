      <p>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has led a noticeably tense Cabinet meeting, his first since Israel’s attorney general announced he will be indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu did not mention the looming indictment during Sunday’s weekly meeting.</p>
      <p>Instead, he was projecting an attitude of business as usual, discussing Iranian belligerency, threats from Gaza and domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>His typically talkative ministers have remained noticeably silent.</p>

      <p>This has been their first public appearances since the attorney general’s announcement on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu’s party has long pledged loyalty to its leader.</p>
      <p>But calls have been made within the party for an immediate primary vote to replace him, sowing the first seeds of rebellion.</p>
      <p>Replacing Mr Netanyahu offers perhaps the most likely option of preventing a looming third election within a year.</p>
