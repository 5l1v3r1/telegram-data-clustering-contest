      <p><b>Seoul</b><b>:</b> South Korea says it is to continue a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan that had been threatened by a long-running dispute. The move was welcomed by the US which had urged the two countries to settle their differences, the BBC reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Seoul announced its decision on Friday, just hours before the pact was due to expire. Tensions between South Korea and Japan go back decades but have recently led to a series of tit-for-tat measures. The tensions have historical roots, and the two countries became embroiled in a deepening trade and diplomatic dispute this year. The intelligence pact, known as GSOMIA (General Security of Military Information Agreement), allowed the two countries to share information about North Korea’s military and nuclear activities directly with each other. Without it, the information would have had to go through their joint-allies in Washington, slowing the process down. (IANS)</p>
