      <p>The level of ranking will depend on how much importance the school gives to inculcating fitness among its students and teachers, besides facilities available for fitness activities.</p>
      <p>In his popular radio programme, Mann Ki Baat on Sunday, Modi said, “In the Fit India Movement, schedules have been drawn for ranking schools in accordance with fitness. The schools that achieve this ranking will also be able to use the Fit India logo and flag.”</p>
      <p>Explaining the ranking system, the Prime Minister said, “Schools can declare themselves as fit by visiting the Fit India portal. Fit India three star and Fit India five star ratings will also be given.</p>
