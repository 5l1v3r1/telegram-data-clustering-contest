      <p>Government putting criminals before victims</p>
      <p>This soft on crime Government is more focused on giving rights back to criminals than protecting victims, Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges says.</p>
      <p>“By giving voting rights to criminals they’re giving them back the voice they have taken away from others.</p>
      <p>“Only days after Corrections announced they are now calling prisoners ‘men in our care’ or ‘clients’, it’s obvious this Government’s priorities lie with prisoners instead of their victims.</p>
      <p>“Prisoners who have received sentences of up to three years aren’t petty criminals. They’re people who have committed serious assaults, robberies, family violence and sexual offences.</p>
      <p>“If you do the crime, then you deserve to lose your voting rights and do the time.</p>
      <p>“National is the Party of law and order, we will change this back should we earn the right to govern in 2020.”</p>
