      <h1>Breaking: QB Tom Brady’s Playing Status vs. Cowboys Decided</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:59:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tom Brady popped up on the injury report at the end of the week. The New England Patriots’ quarterback was listed as “questionable” for this afternoon’s game against the Dallas Cowboys. Brady has reportedly been dealing with some elbow trouble.</p>
      <p>The Patriots are notorious for placing guys like Brady on the injury report, even when there’s almost no chance of them missing the game, and that appeared to be the case here. However, there was some legitimate concern with Brady’s elbow. Usually, Brady is just listed with “shoulder soreness.” The elbow injury might have been something to worry about.</p>
      <p>New England fans can rest easy now, though.</p>
      <p>Brady will play against the Cowboys today.</p>
      <p>“Tom Brady, who popped up on the injury report Friday and is listed as questionable with a right elbow injury, will start today vs. the Cowboys, source said,” Ian Rapoport reports.</p>

      <p>This comes as no surprise, but it will be interesting to monitor Brady’s arm moving forward. The Patriots have struggled in the passing game in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys and the Patriots are set to kick off at 4:25 p.m. E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
