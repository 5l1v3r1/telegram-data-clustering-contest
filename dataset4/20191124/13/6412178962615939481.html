        <b>Middlesbrough have enquired about the possibility of taking Sheffield United defender Kieron Freeman on loan in January, TEAMtalk understands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old joined <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/sheffield-united"><b>the Blades</b></a> from Portsmouth in 2015 and has made 136 appearances for the club to date, but has found game time hard to come by in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Having made only two appearances – both in the EFL Cup – Freeman is keen on a loan move to secure regular game time and TEAMtalk understands that Boro have enquired about the potential of a temporary move for the player.</p>
      <p>As well as <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/middlesbrough"><b>Middlesbrough</b></a>, a number of the club’s Championship rivals have also enquired about his availability.</p>
      <p>Freeman’s only involvement in the Premier League so far this term saw him make the bench in the 2-0 victory away to Everton, but the Englishman was an unused substitute at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>The Blades have enjoyed a solid start to life after promotion from the Championship last season, especially at home, where they took league leaders Liverpool close and beat Arsenal.</p>
