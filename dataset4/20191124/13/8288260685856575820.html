      <p>Commuters were faced with travel chaos after a dramatic smash blocked off a busy Black Country junction.</p>
      <p>Dramatic pictures from the scene, which were taken by Black Country Live and nearby motorists, showed the damaged car at the side of the Oxford Street, Bilston.</p>
      <p>A traffic light was also been knocked onto its side following the smash at around 4pm on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>It is not known if anyone was injured but motorists spoke of travel misery – as part of the major junction was closed off.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said the junction is notorious for crashes and urged people to slow down as the bad weather continues.</p>
      <p>“The junction has been awful lately,” one said. “There are always bumps and shunts – it’s only a matter of time before something worse happens.</p>
      <p>“I hope everyone is ok. The cars looked a bit of a mess.”</p>
