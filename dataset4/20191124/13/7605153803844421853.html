        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 24 – Kenya Prisons, KCB and Kenya Pipeline will represent Kenya in the 2020 Africa Women’s Club Volleyball Championship following the conclusion of the Kenya Volleyball Federation League at Moi International Sports Center Kasarani.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prisons booked the automatic slot after thrashing KCB 3-0 (25-22,25-19,25-23) in the final play-offs to retain the title while the Bankers sailed through to the continental showpiece after finishing second.</p>
      <p>Former champions Kenya Pipeline will also return to the Africa bonanza by virtue of finishing third in last year’s championship that was held in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Kenya Volleyball Federation deputy president Charles Nyaberi was delighted with the level of competition in this year’s event adding that the federation will bring the majority of the games indoor in tandem with FIVB rules and common good practice elsewhere.</p>

      <p>“I laud KCB Bank Kenya for the magnanimous gesture of sponsoring the league play offs for the second year running, we look forward to enhanced and continued partnership with the bank”, Said Nyaberi.</p>
      <p>Prisons assistant coach and player Diana Khisa, who was standing in for Azenga Mavisi, said it was totally a different feeling but was glad the team defended the title.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy that for the short period I have been an assistant coach the team has retained the title. But I must say the two positions are completely different because if you are an official you see a mistake and you think to yourself maybe I could have done differently when I was in court,” the Center player told the Nation.</p>
      <p>KCB Head Coach Japheth Munala hailed his youthful side for their heroic feat and resilience adding that the team will be a force to reckon with.</p>
      <p>“The team played well against experienced Prisons side, we have improved greatly on the point victory margin against them,” said Munala.</p>
