      <h1>Arsenal chiefs 'have no plans to sack Unai Emery'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> allegedly have no plans to make a quick-fire decision on the future of manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>With the Gunners having only recorded two wins from their last 10 matches in the Premier League, there are increasing calls for Emery to be removed from his position.</p>
      <p>However, despite the negative atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium, <i>The Independent</i> claims that the Spaniard remains safe for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>The report says that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raul-sanllehi/"><b>Raul Sanllehi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edu/"><b>Edu</b></a> intend to give Emery at least another three weeks to turn around the club's fortunes.</p>
      <p>The north Londoners next face fixtures away at Norwich City and at home to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion as they bid to close the gap on the top four in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">standings</a>.</p>
      <p>Arsenal currently sit in seventh position, eight points adrift of city rivals Chelsea.</p>
