      <p><b>Eddie Gallagher</b>, the Navy SEAL previously facing a war crimes trial, serves under Secretary of the Navy <b>Richard Spencer </b>and Rear Adm. <b>Collin Green</b>, but that didn’t stop him from publicly trashing them on a Sunday appearance on Fox News.</p>

      <p>“This is all about ego and retaliation,” Gallagher said on a Fox News appearance Sunday, blasting his Navy superiors. “This is nothing about good order and discipline.”</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to retire as scheduled with “all the honors I have earned.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher was acquitted in a <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-acquitted-of-murder/">murder and attempted murder case</a> in July, but he was convicted of posing in a photo with the dead body of 17-year-old ISIS member. He found a vocal supporter in President <b>Donald Trump</b>, <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/legal-expert-trump-order-to-rescind-eddie-gallagher-prosecutors-medals-was-highly-inappropriate/">who ordered to rescind the medals of the prosecutors who worked on Gallagher’s case</a>. That backup continued this month. Gallagher had been demoted, but <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/navy-might-still-kick-eddie-gallagher-out-of-seals-despite-trump-tweet/">POTUS restored his rank</a>. Navy officials were moving forward with proceedings to kick him out, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197507542726909952?s=20">a move that Trump opposed</a> on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Critics say the president’s support of Gallagher and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/opinion/editorials/trump-gallagher-pardon-war-crimes.html">pardon of war crimes</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/opinion/letters/trump-military.html">condones illegal acts by U.S. armed forces, undermines discipline</a>, and puts <a href="https://twitter.com/glennkirschner2/status/1195806853206331393?s=20">American service members in danger</a>.</p>
      <p>Spencer and Green<b> </b><a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/secretary-of-the-navy-top-seal-commander-threaten-to-resign-if-trump-prevents-expulsion-of-accused-war-criminal/">reportedly</a> threatened to resign or make the White House fire them if Gallagher was still a SEAL. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/politics/navy-discipline-edward-gallagher.html">The Navy secretary openly denied the report that he threatened to resign</a>.</p>
      <p>He said he did not consider Trump’s tweet a formal order, but would follow an official demand if one is filed.</p>
      <p>“If the president requests to stop the process, the process stops,” Spencer said, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/politics/navy-discipline-edward-gallagher.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a>. “Good order and discipline is also obeying orders from the president of the United States.”</p>
      <p>It was reported Sunday that the White House said it will not get in the middle of the proceedings to oust Gallagher.</p>
