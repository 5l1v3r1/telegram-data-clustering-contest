      <p>A total of four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have been assigned to contact the Congress, Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs before the floor test, sources have told India Today TV. The Maharashtra Assembly floor test to prove majority has been scheduled for November 30</p>
      <p>The BJP leaders who have allegedly been handing the "Operation Lotus" in Maharashtra are Narayan Rane, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Ganesh Naik, and Babanrao Pachpute, sources said. All the leaders have previously been the members of either Shiv Sena or the Congress or the NCP.</p>
      <p>"They have been assigned the task to reach out to MLAs in Sena, NCP and Congress before the floor test," sources said.</p>
      <p>The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), too, has decided to move its MLAs to Hotel Hyatt, due to security reasons, from Hotel Renaissance where they are currently lodged.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Congress leader <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ashok-chavan-bjp-maharashtra-poaching-mlas-1622224-2019-11-24">Ashok Chavan has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of poaching its MLAs</a> who have been lodged in the JW Marriott hotel.</p>
      <p>Speaking to India Today TV, Ashok Chavan alleged that the BJP has tried to approach the Congress MLAs.</p>
      <p>"All our MLA are at JW Marriott hotel. Our MLAs are being approached by the BJP. They are getting calls. BJP leaders are booking rooms and staying in the hotel. Our MLAs are contacted by BJP but let me assure you that our MLAs are intact," Ashok Chavan said.</p>
      <p>The Congress leader also said the MLAs of the Shiv Sena and the NCP are intact. "BJP is trying very hard to delay the matter and trying to get time from the Supreme Court to break our MLAs. Our MLAs are telling us everything. No one from the three parties will go to the BJP," Ashok Chavan said.</p>
      <p>Retreating that the three allies have the numbers to form the government, Ashok Chavan said the parties are not worried about anything.</p>
      <p>On Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's justification of joining hands with the BJP, Ashok Chavan said, "Ajit Pawar is in no position to thank anyone. First, he has to prove majority on the floor."</p>
