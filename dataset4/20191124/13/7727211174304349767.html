      <p>Film Blue Story will not be shown in any Merseyside cinemas, after a mass brawl broke out involving more than 100 youths.</p>
      <p>Violent clashes were seen in Star City entertainment complex, near Nechells, Birmingham, on Saturday evening as officers rushed to break up a fight.</p>
      <p>Police stormed the cinema after receiving reports of "more than 100 people" fighting with machetes.</p>
      <p>Videos shared on social media showed teenage girls and boys involved in the fight, as police arrested a number of youngsters, including a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Following the violence, the British drama has now been pulled from all Vue cinemas across the country.</p>
      <p>A recorded message on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/super-cinema-entertainment-hub-lost-17157763">cinema </a>answer phone says that the movie will no longer be screened at any of its venues.</p>
      <p>The message is heard when trying to call Vue's branch in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead</a>.</p>

      <p>It said: "We regret that we will no longer be screening the film Blue Story at any of our venues.</p>
      <p>"Should you have a booking for this film, please say cancellation when prompted and a member of our team will be with you shortly to assist you with your booking."</p>
      <p>It is understood that the film is banned from Southport Vue and Cheshire Oaks cinemas too.</p>
      <p>The film was released on Friday and it stars Top Boy's actor Michael Ward.</p>
      <p>A description of the film reads: "Timmy and Marco are best friends who live in different London boroughs.</p>
      <p>"That’s until Marco is beaten up by one of Timmy’s friends, and the pair are drawn into a gang war where your postcode decides which side you’re on.</p>
      <p>"Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, directs this British drama about the effects of gang violence in London."</p>
      <p>Saturday's fight erupted at about 5.30pm as many children had flocked to the entertainment complex dressed in Frozen costumes for the sequel of the Disney hit.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-vue-bans-blue-story-20949659">One witness told Mirror Online</a>: "That's probably one of the scariest moments of my life. Me and my daughter were in a queue to watch Frozen, loads of little kids there, all dressed up and everything, then these girls jumped on another girl and loads of these kids just started fighting.</p>
      <p>"Armed police came with Tasers. All the people that were fighting run off into the cinema. There’s about 15 to 20 police cars. I’m shaking."</p>
      <p>West Midlands police said: "Five teenagers have been arrested after major disorder involving up to 100 youths at Star City in Birmingham last night (Saturday).</p>
      <p>"Two machetes were seized during the trouble, which saw pockets of fighting and seven police officers left with minor injuries as they dealt with the crowds in and around the cinema.</p>
      <p>"Those arrested are a girl aged 13, a girl and boy both aged 14 and a 19-year-old man.</p>
      <p>"They were all held on suspicion of assaulting police. In addition, a boy aged 14 was held on suspicion of obstructing police.</p>
      <p>"The officers hurt during the trouble had minor facial injuries. In addition to the machetes, a knife was recovered from a roundabout near to the venue. Officers are working to understand the reason for the trouble."</p>
