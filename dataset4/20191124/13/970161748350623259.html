      <p>Chris Martin has revealed that he paid his children to appear on Coldplay’s latest album.</p>
      <p>The rocker’s two children, 15-year-old Apple and 13-year-old Moses, who he shares with ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow, have featured on a track on his band’s latest album, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/coldplay-surprise-welsh-locals-revealing-everyday-life-album-tracklist-newspaper-listing-10973662/">Everyday Life</a>, and he revealed that he also asked them if they wanted to be a part of the new record.</p>
      <p>‘I asked them. And I pay them, proper fees like everyone,’ he revealed. ‘And they are allowed to say no.’</p>
      <p>Chris also revealed that being a father has had some influence on the fifth track on the album, Daddy.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t like explaining songs. However, that came from three places,’ he added to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/culture/chris-martin-coldplay-interview-singer-everyday-life-new-album-god-is-the-answer-children-apple-moses-hxzp8h625">The Sunday Times’ Culture magazine.</a> ‘First, I have many people in my life whose dads f*** off, which is sad and confusing and, if you empathise as a dad, you wonder, what was he feeling that he thought that would be best? Second, I have kids, and I have to leave all the time.’</p>

      <p>The 42-year-old explained that learning about the continued existence of racism and lack of children without fathers in the United States also played an important part in shaping the song.</p>
      <p>‘[That song was] written about learning about the prison industrial complex in America; the outright racism woven into so many laws, and kids, who, as a result, are denied their fathers,’  he said.</p>
      <p>‘The world is in such a way that you can no longer just sit back with your creature comforts and ignore the rest of it.’</p>

      <p>It comes after Coldplay recently revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/coldplay-wont-tour-unless-carbon-netural-release-new-album-11192847/">that they will not tour for their new album unless their shows will be carbon neutral</a>, as they want to do their bit for the environment.</p>
      <p>‘We’re taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial,’ Chris told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-50497715/chris-martin-on-coldplay-s-environmental-touring-pause">BBC News.</a> ‘All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job.</p>
      <p>‘We’re taking time over the next year or two to work out how can, not only our tour be sustainable, but how it can be actively beneficial.’</p>
