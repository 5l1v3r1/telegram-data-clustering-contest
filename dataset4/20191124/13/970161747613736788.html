      <p>Turnips…they’re not the sexiest of vegetables, are they? Not compared to the alluring glamour of, say, the aubergine or asparagus.</p>
      <p>For a long time dismissed as ‘peasant food’, they’ve had to suffer the yearly indignity of seeing pumpkins, their arrogant cousins, hogging the Halloween limelight – even though Jack O’ lanterns were traditionally made with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack-o%27-lantern#/media/File:Traditional_Irish_halloween_Jack-o'-lantern.jpg">turnips.</a></p>
      <p>But now, at long last, the ugly sister of the vegetable world has been given its own shot at stardom: turnip tops (i.e. the green bits) are the hottest new trend in British cuisine.</p>
      <p>Also known by the Italian ‘cime di rapa’, which sounds a bit more glamorous, turnip greens are now being stocked by online supermarket <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/06/ocados-calorie-saver-tool-criticised-for-triggering-those-with-eating-disorders-10527600/">Ocado.</a> and similarly upscale retailers around the country, with customers willing to pay as much as £10 per kilo.</p>
      <p>Whereas in the past, turnip greens were a niche ingredient mostly used by specialist chefs, more and more people are trying them out in their home cooking.</p>

      <p>Part of the appeal of turnip tops lies in their versatility. They’re traditionally used in a range of different cuisines, including Italian, Spanish and Korean food (in which they are often fermented and served kimchi-style).</p>

      <p>‘Turnip tops is traditional peasant food,’ celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli tells the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718903/How-turnip-tops-latest-delicacy-Britains-restaurants.html">Mail on Sunday</a>, ‘People in northern Italy tease those from Puglia about eating turnip greens. But they can be delicious in so many ways.’</p>
      <p>Locatello uses turnip tops at Locanda Locatelli, his Michelin-starred restaurant in the West End, London.</p>
      <p>‘Cime di rapa has a slightly bitter flavour, and is very easy to cook and very versatile,’ he says, ‘I don’t really know why it isn’t grown commercially here as it could be done easily.’</p>
      <p>As well as Locatelli’s restaurant, you can find turnip tops in a number of classy restaurants across the London, such as Trullo, in Islington, where they’re served as part of a main course with Yorkshire Partridge and chicken liver crostini.</p>
      <p>Belgravi’as Zafferano, meanwhile, serves the greens alongside halibut and fresh chilli.</p>
      <p>If the trend continues at this pace, turnip greens will no doubt be appearing in a restaurant near you before long. If you can’t wait till then, why not try them out at home yourself?</p>
