      <p>After exploding onto the scene with his smash hit “Leave Me Alone,” Brooklyn native Flipp Dinero decided to come through on Friday and share his long awaited debut album <i>LOVE FOR GUALA</i>, featuring guest appearances from <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kodakblack/profile">Kodak Black</a>, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby/profile/">Lil Baby</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rich-the-kid/profile">Rich The Kid</a>, and fellow New Yorker Jay Critch. "I try to give fans what they want before I give them what they need… there’s a transition from hood sounds to a more universal sound: it starts with songs from the street, then love songs, to ending with songs about growth and being a man,” Flipp said of the project.</p>
      <p>One of the tracks thats been getting some early praise is the record with Jay Critch called “Fritolays,” which finds the two NYC spitters rapping about stacking up their chips &amp; J’s over production from Cam Beats.</p>
      <p>Take a listen and let us know what you think. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/stream-flipp-dineros-debut-album-love-for-guala-ft-kodak-black-lil-baby-and-more-new-mixtape.119810.html"><i>LOVE FOR GUALA </i>out now</a>.</p>

        </u>
      </p>
      <p>I told my mama one day I'd get paid<br/>She takin' trips when it's cold in the winter<br/>Daddy gon' smile while I hop out the rental<br/>I pray for my sins, asking God to forgive 'em<br/>I chase the chips all I want, Frito Lay<br/>I pull the flip while it's out of the rental<br/>All for the guala, it's only the guala<br/>I swear shit is stuck up all up in my mental</p>
      <p>- Flipp</p>
