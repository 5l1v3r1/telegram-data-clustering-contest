        <b>Tesla <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50536200">launched its pick-up truck</a> with a bang this week, and then a crash, as its windows were smashed in a demonstration to show that they were unbreakable. Tesla has still received 150,000 pre-orders, despite the gaffe, although the company does not currently accept direct payment in Bitcoin.</b>

      <h3>Bitcoin Price</h3>
      <p>Well, there hasn’t been a lot to cheer about when it comes to bitcoin price this week. Gains made in the last month were steadily trickling away, until Thursday, when they started to gush.</p>
      <p>Price <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drops-below-8k-for-first-time-this-month-heres-why/">fell below $8k</a> for the first time this month, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-forces-miners-to-shed-20-million/">forcing out smaller miners</a> which lead to a further dump.</p>
      <p>The crash <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chinese-crypto-mining-giant-trades-first-day-flat/">continued into Friday</a>, and pretty soon we were <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-black-friday-marching-to-7000-at-fast-speed/">diving headlong towards $7k</a>. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-7000-as-whale-dumps-on-huobi/">That level was broken through</a>, although fortunately some support was found there and prices recovered to rise back above $7k, where they have since stayed.</p>
      <p>Still, if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-upside-potential-at-8k-is-far-greater-than-the-down/">upside potential was greater than down at $8k</a>, then it stands to reason that it is even greater at $7k. Although one analyst mooted a scenario where bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-to-touch-4-2k-after-q4-sell-off-analyst-calls/">dipped as low as $4.2k</a>.</p>
      <p>So when are we expecting the next major bull-run? Thursday was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-run-to-start-on-thursday-after-difficulty-adjustment/">touted as a possibility</a>, but the Friday dump certainly isn’t the best look for the start of a rally. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-be-bullish-long-term/">March 2020</a> currently seems a long way off, but that is another date suggested by some analysts.</p>
      <h3>News In Brief</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrency got a boost in the UK this week as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uk-crypto-gets-green-light-as-lawmakers-classify-them-as-property/">lawmakers classified digital assets as ‘property’</a>. As the country with the most crypto users in Europe, we looked at the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-3-places-to-buy-bitcoin-in-britain/">three best places to buy bitcoin</a> for UK citizens.</p>
      <p>Financial giant, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-wins-trading-license-in-new-york-hurray-to-bitcoin/">Fidelity won a license to trade bitcoin in New York</a>, but will it tempt Wall Street to dip its toes further into the market.</p>
      <p>The Mimblewimble privacy architecture was claimed to be <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/mimblewimble-attacked-using-60-per-week-on-aws/">open to attack</a>, by spending just $60 per week on Amazon Web Services. Then that claim was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/mimblewimble-attack-is-factually-inaccurate-grin-team-responds/">claimed to be ‘factually inaccurate’</a>, or wrong, as some people would call it.</p>
      <p>Canadian <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/einstein-exchange-closes-funds-disappear-into-thin-air/">cryptocurrency exchange, Einstein, closed down</a>, with a complete disappearance of customer funds. Is there something in the Canadian water?</p>
      <p>Ripple was accused of using its affiliated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-affiliated-foundation-is-a-corporate-tax-shelter-says-messari/">charity foundation as a corporate and executive tax shelter</a>. And that was before Tone Vays let rip with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/what-tone-vays-hates-most-about-ripples-xrp-token/">four things he hates most about Ripple and XRP</a>.</p>
      <p>Craig Wright is being <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/craig-wright-to-cough-up-658k-in-court-fees/">pursued with legal fees to the tune of $658k</a> in the case brought against him by the estate of former partner Dave Kleiman.</p>
      <h3>And Finally…</h3>
      <p>Earlier in the week, The Block was crowing about how embarrassing it was for the rest of the crypto media outlets, reporting a story based on a supposed ‘meme’ tweet, by usually reliable China news source, Dovey Wan.</p>
      <p>However, it rather shot itself in the foot, when later in the week it reported a police raid on Binance’s Shanghai office. The problem was, that there was no police raid, nor even an office, leading Binance CEO, CZ, to confirm that the exchange would be <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-to-sue-the-block-for-damaging-the-exchanges-reputation/">suing The Block for damaging its reputation</a>.</p>
