      <h1>IFFI uploads Gulzar pic instead of Ray in film credit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:10:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>In a goof up, the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) attached veteran lyricist-poet Gulzar's picture instead of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray's in the director's biography of “Ganashatru” on its official website.</p>
      <p>The screenshot of the webpage of the homage section of IFFI website, featuring Gulzar's picture as the director of the 1989 Bengali film went viral on social media on Friday.</p>
      <p>However, soon after reports of the mix up started doing the rounds, the festival organisers rectified the mistake.</p>
      <p>The 50th edition of IFFI started on November 20, with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and south superstar Rajinikanth attending the opening ceremony.</p>
      <p>The festival will conclude on November 28.</p>
