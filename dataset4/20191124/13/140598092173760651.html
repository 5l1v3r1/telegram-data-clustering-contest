      <h1>Labour plans to pay £58bn 'debt of honour' to redress pensions of Fifties women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:16:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/taha-lokhandwala/" target="_blank">Taha Lokhandwala</a></address>
      <p>The Labour Party has announced a £58bn plan to pay back a “historic debt of honour” to women born in the Fifties who have been affected by the equalising of the state pension age between men and women.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has said affected women could receive up to £31,300 in compensation depending on when they were born. This would be made up of weekly payments of up to £100.</p>
      <p>The issue and apparent necessity for compensation began in 1995, when the then Conservative Government said the age at which women could claim their <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/news/fifties-women-not-discriminated-against-state-pension-age-increase/">state pension</a> would increase from 60 to 65 by 2018 – to be in line with men.</p>
      <p>In 2011, the coalition Government increased this to 66 for both men and women by October 2020.</p>
      <p>However, the policies significantly impacted nearly 4 million women born in the Fifties would have turned 60 during the period in which the state pension age is gradually increasing from 60 to 66.</p>
      <p>Many claim they were not properly informed of the change and their state pension age increased dramatically just before they were set to claim the payment. This unduly impacted their finances and life plans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/labour-unveils-radical-manifesto-means-money/">Labour has said </a>all women born between April 6, 1950 and April 6, 1960 who qualify for the state pension will receive compensation.</p>
      <p>This will be £100 per week for women born between April 6, 1950 and April 5, 1955. This will then be tapered down for women born between April 6, 1955 and April 6, 1960.</p>
      <p>The Opposition Party said the maximum redress would be £31,300 with the average Fifties woman receiving £15,380. The payments would be made over the next five-years should Labour win the election and cost the taxpayers a total of £58bn.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the policy and redress was about “consideration for those who have paid into the system... only to be hung out to dry by a Government that puts the interest of the richest first.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.”</p>
      <p>The policy has raised eyebrows, however, as the £58bn promise was not accounted for in Labour’s manifesto, launched on Thursday. The Party had promised some redress to Fifties women but made no account for it in its costings.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/news/lib-dems-promise-compensation-fifties-women-state-pension-age/">Liberal Democrats also committed to providing some </a>compensation but offered no detailed plan or costings. A full reversal of the policy of equalising state pension ages for men and women would cost the taxpayer around £77bn, according to them fund shop AJ Bell.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party has also <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/news/labour-freeze-state-pension-age-let-manual-workers-retire-early/">committed to freezing the state pension</a> age for men and women at 66 rather than increase it to 67 which is due to happen in the next decade.</p>
      <p>Fifties woman <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/financial-planning/economic-fair-play-next-metoo-give-greedy-women-due/">have long been campaigning for a reversal of the policy</a> and for redress as they claim they were not properly informed of the increases.</p>
      <p>Many have had to return back to work after planning to retire, only to realise they were not entitled to the state pension.</p>
      <p>Last month, a campaign group <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/news/fifties-women-not-discriminated-against-state-pension-age-increase/">challenged the Government in the High Court</a>, however, Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple ruled in favour of the Government.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson had previously pledged to consider the impact on Fifties women, however, seemingly backtracked on taking action speaking on a BBC campaign event on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have looked at it, looked at it and looked at it. I would love to be able magic some solution. It is very expensive to come up with the solution that Fifties women want. I cannot promise I can magic up that money.”</p>
