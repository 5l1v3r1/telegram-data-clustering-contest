      <p>The former Chelsea manager got off to a winning start as Spurs boss on Saturday, as goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-kane/"><b>Harry Kane</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-moura/"><b>Lucas Moura</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/son-heung-min/"><b>Son Heung-min</b></a> helped the North London club <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/west-ham-united-vs-spurs_game_92634.html">beat West Ham United 3-2</a>.</p>
      <p>Last year's Champions League finalists can secure their place in the last 16 with a win on Tuesday over the Greek champions, who themselves need a win to keep their feint hopes of progressing alive.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how Spurs could line up for Tuesday's showdown.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hugo-lloris/"><b>Hugo Lloris</b></a> (elbow), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erik-lamela/"><b>Erik Lamela</b></a> (thigh), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michel-vorm/"><b>Michel Vorm</b></a> (calf), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-davies/"><b>Ben Davies</b></a> (other)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jan-vertonghen/"><b>Jan Vertonghen</b></a> (hamstring), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tanguy-ndombele/"><b>Tanguy Ndombele</b></a> (groin)</p>

        <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/injury-news/injuries-and-suspensions/spurs-injury-suspension-list-vs-olympiacos_380464.html">&gt; Click here for Tottenham's full injury and suspension list ahead of this match</a>
      </p>
      <p>With Lloris and Vorm both injured, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paulo-gazzaniga/"><b>Paulo Gazzaniga</b></a> will continue in the Spurs goal for Tuesday's game.</p>
      <p>Davies went off against West Ham with a suspected muscle problem and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-rose/"><b>Danny Rose</b></a> is expected to deputise on Tuesday, with the remainder of the defence likely to remain unchanged for Mourinho's second game in charge.</p>
      <p>Although he will need to pass a late fitness test, Ndombele should come into the midfield to partner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-dier/"><b>Eric Dier</b></a>, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dele-alli/"><b>Dele Alli</b></a>'s impressive display on Saturday should see him continue in the number 10 role, despite <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/giovani-lo-celso/"><b>Giovani Lo Celso</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a> both pushing to feature.</p>
      <p>Mourinho put his faith in Lucas Moura on the right against the Hammers and the Brazilian delivered a performance that will likely ensure that he continues on Tuesday, with Son on the left.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane netted his 21st goal for club and country this season on Saturday and it is hard to see anything other than a late injury dislodging the England star from the team.</p>
