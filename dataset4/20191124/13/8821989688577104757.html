      <h1>Guns N’ Roses Reunion Tour is Third Biggest Grossing in History</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:18:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p>The once-impossible reunion tour that saw<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/guns-n-roses/"> Guns N’ Roses</a> icons <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/axl-rose/">Axl Rose</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/slash/">Slash</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/duff-mckagan/">Duff McKagan</a> play together again is the third biggest grossing road trip of all time, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8544389/guns-n-roses-in-this-lifetime-tour"><i>Billboard</i></a> reported.</p>
      <p>Titled Not in This Lifetime <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/guns-n-roses-not-in-this-lifetime-tour/">after an answer Rose once gave</a> to a question about working with Slash again – and opening with Rose <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/axl-rose-broken-foot/">breaking his foot </a>at the first show – the tour began in 2016 and ended on Nov. 3. In that period the band sold 5,371,891 tickets and grossed $584.2 million from 158 concerts. <a href="https://popcrush.com/tags/ed-sheeran/">Ed Sheeran</a> holds the top spot with $775 million grossed during his Divide tour of 2017-2019, and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/u2/">U2</a> remain in second place with their 360º tour, which took in $736 million between 2009-2011.</p>
      <p>“The tour was rooted in North America, with 87 of 158 shows (55%) taking place in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico,” <i>Billboard</i> noted. “But there were also multiple visits to Europe (31 shows), Asia (16) and South America (15), plus eight dates in Australia and one in Johannesburg, South Africa. “With more time in North America, the band was able to play a more even mix of stadiums and arenas, as opposed to quicker runs of only stadiums internationally. Their home-continent touring amounted to $258.5 million and 2.3 million tickets sold, still far ahead of Europe’s $166.1 million.”</p>
      <p>Guns N’ Roses made more than $10 million at a single engagement five times, and sold more than 100,000 tickets for a single engagement on four occasions. The most successful of those was their two-night stop at London Stadium, U.K. in June 2017, where they grossed $17.7 million and sold 140,877 tickets.</p>
      <p>The band are expected to turn their attention to their <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/guns-n-roses-new-album/">first album</a> since 2008’s <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/guns-n-roses-chinese-democracy-long-wait/"><i>Chinese Democracy</i></a>. “[T]here's been so much talk about this Guns N’ Roses record, which we haven't actually done anything with,” guitarist Slash said in April. “So we're gonna sort of focus on that.”</p>

      <h3>Guns N' Roses Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide (We Think)</h3>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Chris Weber, Johnny Kreiss and various bassists (Rose / Hollywood Rose, 1983-1984)</h4>
      <p>This very early lineup of Hollywood Roses, a precursor to Guns N' Roses, records a five-song demo. Stradlin had been childhood friends with Axl Rose.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Slash, Steven Adler, Steven Darrow (Hollywood Rose, 1984)</h4>
      <p>Slash briefly joins, seemingly inching Guns N' Roses closer to its classic lineup, but then Stradlin leaves. A final Hollywood Rose show at the Troubadour briefly brings everything to a halt.</p>

      <h4>Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler, with various singers (Road Crew, 1985)</h4>
      <p>Slash, Adler and McKagan go on form Road Crew, but are without a singer since Rose was now with L.A. Guns. Auditions go nowhere, however, and they split.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Tracii Guns, Ole Beich, Rob Gardner (1985)</h4>
      <p>Meanwhile, L.A. Guns grow into a new band, which Axl and Tracii retitle by combining their stage names. Soon, Guns N' Roses return to the Troubadour.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Tracii Guns, Duff McKagan, Rob Gardner (1985)</h4>
      <p>Beich is quickly replaced by Duff McKagan, who also had booking connections. Those rough-and-tumble early dates became known as the Hell Tour.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Slash, Duff McKagan, Rob Gardner (1985)</h4>
      <p>Guns' failure to make rehearsal leads the band back to Slash, who now had a musical connection with the newly recruited McKagan as well.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Slash, Duff McKagan, Steven Adler (1985-1990)</h4>
      <p>McKagan then brings in the final piece of the Guns N' Roses classic-era lineup, as the band adds Adler from Road Crew. A pair of multi-platinum albums follow.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Slash, Duff McKagan, Steven Adler, Dizzy Reed (1990)</h4>
      <p>Keyboardist Reed, a friend of Rose's, adds further depth to their sound in the run up to 'Use Your Illusion I and II.' He eventually becomes the band's second-longest tenured member ever, after Rose.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Slash, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, Dizzy Reed (1990)</h4>
      <p>An earlier bandmate of Reed's, Sorum takes over for Adler, who has struggled with drug addiction. The 'Use Your Illusion' albums go on sell 14 million copies in the U.S. alone.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, Dizzy Reed, Gilby Clarke (1991-1994)</h4>
      <p>Stradlin is the next founding member to leave, reportedly having gotten fed up with the band's outsized lifestyle. Clarke and Slash become close, leading to later solo collaborations.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Guns N' Roses + Background Singers, Horns (1991)</h4>
      <p>The expansive 'Use Your Illusion I and II' projects led to a similarly overstuffed tour that featured a 12-piece band including an additional keyboardist, three background vocalists and the 976 Horns.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, Dizzy Reed, Paul Tobias (1994-1996)</h4>
      <p>Tobias, a childhood friend who collaborated with Axl in Hollywood Rose, takes over for Clarke – and sparks the next lineup shift. Slash balks, and soon departs.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, Dizzy Reed, Paul Tobias, Robin Finck (1997)</h4>
      <p>Finck takes over for Slash, after a stint as Nine Inch Nails' touring guitarist. But first, simmering tensions led to a blow up over an update of 'Sympathy for the Devil,' recorded without Slash's friend Clarke. Slash calls this Rolling Stones cover "the sound of the band breaking up."</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Dizzy Reed, Paul Tobias, Robin Finck, Josh Freese (1997)</h4>
      <p>Sorum also found it difficult to work alongside Tobias, once describing him in Q magazine as the "Yoko Ono of Guns N' Roses." Sorum is replaced by Freese, best known for his tenure with Devo, later played with Nine Inch Nails, too.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Dizzy Reed, Paul Tobias, Robin Finck, Josh Freese, Tommy Stinson, Chris Pitman (1998-1999)</h4>
      <p>McKagan's departure leaves Rose as the band's final classic-era member. Stinson, of Replacements fame, takes over on bass. Pitman, a multi-instrumentalist, had earlier worked with Tool.</p>

      <h4>Guns N' Roses + Other Guitarists</h4>
      <p>Navarro, of Jane's Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, plays guitar on "Oh My God," from 1999's 'End of Days' soundtrack. Zakk Wylde also auditioned at one point.</p>

      <p>Finck is replaced by Brian Carroll, a guitarist whose on-stage appearance led to the nickname Buckethead. Carroll continues a very busy, more experimental solo career.</p>

      <p>Freese leaves to form A Perfect Circle with Maynard James Keenan. He's succeeded by Bryan "Brain" Mantia, a childhood friend of Buckethead's who also had a stint in Primus.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Dizzy Reed, Paul Tobias, Tommy Stinson, Chris Pitman, Buckethead, Brain, Robin Finck (2000-2002)</h4>
      <p>Finck returns to give Guns N' Roses a three-guitar sound that Axl Rose has tended to favor in the band's latter-day era. Work with Nine Inch Nails continues.</p>

      <h4>Axl Rose, Dizzy Reed, Tommy Stinson, Chris Pitman, Buckethead, Brain, Robin Finck, Richard Fortus (2002-2004)</h4>
      <p>A smattering of long-awaited live dates followed, but Tobias ultimately left in frustration over the band's general inactivity. Successor Richard Fortus had been with the Psychedelic Furs.</p>

      <p>After mounting their first tour since 1993, Guns N' Roses saw the busy Buckethead replaced by Bumblefoot, who'd come recommended by Joe Satriani. Work continues on Guns N' Roses' first album in a decade.</p>

      <p>In early 2016 Guns N' Roses announced that Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan would reunite for the "Not in this Lifetime" tour, the first time all three have been on stage together since 1993. The lineup for their first show, April 1st at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, also featured longtime keyboardist Dizzy Reed, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer, and second keyboardist Melissa Reese.</p>
