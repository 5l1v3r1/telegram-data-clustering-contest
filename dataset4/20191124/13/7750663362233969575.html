      <h1>Aston Villa to rival Crystal Palace for Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/aston-villa/"><b>Aston Villa</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rhian-brewster/"><b>Rhian Brewster</b></a> as a potential January signing.</h2>

      <p>Despite being part of the first-team squad at the Merseyside giants this season, Brewster has made just two starts, each of which came in the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p>As a result of his lack of game time, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> are allegedly <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/transfer-talk/news/palace-to-make-loan-move-for-brewster_380344.html">contemplating a loan approach</a> for the England Under-21 international at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Mirror</i>, Villa are also considering a move for the 19-year-old as they look for backup for Wesley.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonathan-kodjia/"><b>Jonathan Kodjia</b></a> is currently filling the role of deputy, Villa may look to cash in on the Ivorian in January due to his contract expiring in the summer.</p>
      <p>Liverpool boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> has recently suggested that he may be prepared to allow Brewster to go out on loan.</p>
