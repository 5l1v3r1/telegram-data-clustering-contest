      <p>The Kelowna Rockets announced today that they have acquired 20-year-old centre Jadon Joseph from the Moose Jaw Warriors.</p>
      <p>Joseph was exchanged for forward Kyle Crosbie, overage forward Kobe Mohr and goaltender James Porter.</p>
      <p>“We needed to get a right shot centre-man that can consistently win face-offs,” said Rockets president and GM Bruce Hamilton. </p>
      <p>“Kobe was a big part of this deal, they really wanted him back in the trade. James wanted to get back into the league and Crosbie wanted a chance to play more minutes.”</p>
      <p>For the Moose Jaw Warriors, Joseph has appeared in 21 games this season, posting 13 points and 21 penalty minutes.</p>
      <p>In the last four seasons, he has played in 209 WHL regular season games, collecting 113 points and 120 penalty minutes.</p>
      <p>Joseph has also played for Lethbridge, Vancouver and Regina.</p>
      <p>He will be making his debut with the Rockets on Tuesday at Prospera Place at 7:05 p.m., against the Edmonton Oil Kings.</p>
