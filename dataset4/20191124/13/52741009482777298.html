      <h2>The away game ends with a loss for the Rangers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Maddie Demarte</a></address>
      <p>The Rangers were down on their luck from the start of the matchup.</p>
      <p>And it turned into yet another loss on the road.  This time, a 3-1 defeat at the hands of the Eastern Conference-leading Peterborough Petes.</p>
      <p>Following a scoreless first period, two unanswered goals were scored in the second by the Petes.</p>
      <p>Declan Chisholm and Tucker Robertson grabbed those points, while Zach Gallant managed to score the Petes' third goal in the final 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Finally, in the third frame, Jonathan Yantsis put one on the board to prevent a shutout with just over a minute left to go in the game.</p>
      <p>It's the team's fourth loss in a row; they haven't scored more than three goals in a game since October 14th against Sudbury, when they beat the Wolves 7-3 at The Aud.</p>
      <p>The Rangers are in Erie against the Otters Thursday, November 28 at 7:00 p.m.</p>
      <p>You can catch the action live on 570 NEWS.</p>
