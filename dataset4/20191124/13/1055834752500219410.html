      <p>The <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Pokemon+GO">Pokemon GO</a> Twitter account has finally informed users that they have upgraded trainers storage. You should now have enough room for the various Pokemon and items you’ve collected whilst playing the popular mobile game. The limit for Pokemon storage has been expanded to 3,000 and item capacity upgrades mean you can now store up to 2,500 items. It’s clearly been long overdue, but it is a more than welcome addition.</p>
