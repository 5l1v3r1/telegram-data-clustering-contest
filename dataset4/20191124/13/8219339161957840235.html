      <p>Apple has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/20/austin-texas-campus/">officially broken ground</a> on its new $1 billion campus in Austin, Texas. The campus will be 3 million square feet in size and initially home 5,000 employees with the capacity to grow to 15,000 employees. This new campus is expected to open in 2022.</p>
      <p>Tim Cook also traveled to Austin this week to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/20/tim-cook-donald-trump-austin/">tour the existing Flextronics plant</a> where the Mac Pro has been assembled since 2013. President Trump joined Cook on this tour, with the Apple CEO thanking him for making the United States investments possible.</p>
      <p>A report from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/21/bloomberg-ios-14-ios-13/">Bloomberg has offered new details</a> on Apple’s development process for iOS 14. In an effort to prevent the update from being as buggy and unstable as iOS 13 has been, Apple is reportedly implementing a new system that will make it easier for engineers to test and remove features throughout the development process.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/18/apple-announces-special-app-focused-event-for-december-2nd/">Apple announced this week that it will hold</a> a special evening on December 2. The invite for the event features a a golden App Store logo, with the tagline “loved by millions, created by the best.” Apple says the event will honor its favorite apps and games of 2019.</p>
      <p>This means you shouldn’t expect a focus on new hardware products. Instead, the December 2 date of the event lines up with when Apple usually announces its app of the year, game of the year, and other top charts</p>
