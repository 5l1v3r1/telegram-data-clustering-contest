          </p>
          <p>Making an advent into the dramatic land of the Premier League is always an arduous and tepid proposition but for Sheffield United, it’s been a relatively easy perspective. The eighth place the side occupy ahead of today’s impending encounter is vindictive of the tenacious and tenacity filled brand of football the team have doled out in the ongoing edition of the league, one they’ll be looking to reverberate today as well.</p>
          <p>While the side’s results have shown the fight and character prevelant in the unit in abundance, what has really impressed in the resolve, will, valour and fortitude present in the side. A staunch, stringent and extremely well disciplined defence paired with a quick, lethal and clinical attacking contingent has made for an intoxicating brew, one which is a testament to the resplendent brand of football the side have indulged in.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, their opponents of the day, Manchester United have been anything but with the side regressing, waning and wavering to go on a never ending downward spiral. Their performance have been lacklustre and lopsided, ones which have seen the side be clearly caught bereft of ideas of how to wrench out of their impasse with the team currently in 12th place with a mere four wins from 12 matches.</p>
                <p>However, with a 3-1 win over Brighton in their most recent outing in the league, they’ll be somewhat buoyed when they take on Sheffield United who drew against Tottenham most recently. This match will be a gruelling test of the attacking cauldrons with both the sides’ backline set to be at the forefront in a match where defence is given the foremost responsibility.</p>

                            <h3>Top Goal Scorer</h3>
                            <p>
                              <b>Sheffield United</b>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>SHF Vs MUN Dream11  Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With Henderson having being brought in on loan from Manchester United, the shot stopper will be ineligible for this encounter, meaning Simon Moore is set to take up goal-keeping duties for the home side today. He comes into our side instantly with the shot stopper enshrined with acumen on how to leave oppositions in angst with some well directed saves.</p>
                            <h3>SHF Vs MUN Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>A massive reason for Sheffield United being so triumphant this season is due to the illustrious framework they have imbedded in place in defence this season. At just 9 goals let in this season till now, the side have covered themselves in glory with pleasing to the eye defensive astuteness which have won us over. </p>
                            <p>It sees us repose faith in the side’s backline for the impending encounter with us deciding to move in with both of their fullbacks for this one in the form of George Baldock and Enda Stevens. While the two have been the custodians of their side’s defence, the duo has also incorporated its capabilities to totter down the park and provide attacking support as well.</p>
                            <p>We are choosing the two defenders from Manchester United as well with the side looking to tighten things at the back to compensate for a lopsided attacking unit. There is a heavily likelihood of this being a 0-0, something which points us towards Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire for the encounter.</p>
                            <h3>SHF Vs MUN Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>We had to begin this fixture from John Lundstram from Sheffield United. The player has embodied Sheffield United’s journey this season with his unprecedented and compelling success on the field resonating his outfit’s consummate success as well.</p>
                            <p>He leads the ranks for their goal scorers with the three to his name and along with being the heartbeat of their defensive setup as well, the player offers pristine value to us to see him become an instant pick. His counterparts Oliver Norwood and John Fleck will be handed over onus in the attacking facet and with the two players capable of slandering Manchester United, the deadly duo is hammered down into our Dream 11 setup as well.</p>
                            <p>Just the one pick from the opposition meanwhile with us deciding to venture in with Juan Mata for this one.</p>
                            <h3>SHF Vs MUN Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>David McGoldrick’s return from injury immensely boosts and propels the home side’s attacking sojourns with the player being someone who can leave opposition’s in angst given the calibre bestowed in him as a striker. From Manchester United meanwhile, we are moving in for their leading goal scorer in the form of six goal man Marcus Rashford to bring an end to our day’s proceedings for this tie.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Baldock is going to captain our side for this one while Lundstram is the vice-captain.</p>
