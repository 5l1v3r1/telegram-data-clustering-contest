      <p>Not many people thought I would make it to 60 — myself included — but here I am.</p>

      <p>And I had a great day at West Ham as they made a proper fuss of the birthday boy.</p>
      <p>Fans put on a party in the morning before I was guest of honour against Tottenham. Sadly, the result didn’t go our way.</p>
      <p>I’ve been in a few scrapes over the years and I’ve had more court appearances than Andy Murray but I’ve had plenty of fun along the way and I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
      <p>I sometimes look at the photo of the 19-year-old with the curly ginger hair in the St Mirren strip and think if only he knew what was to come.</p>

      <p>The face and hair might have changed ever so slightly over the years, but not much. A couple of wrinkles. A wee blond highlight.</p>
      <p>But it’s funny because I do have a recognisable face but it wasn’t always the case — even when I was the top scorer in British football, hardly anyone knew what I looked like.</p>
      <p>It was my first season with West Ham but because of a dispute between football league clubs in England and the broadcasters, there was a TV blackout and hardly any matches were shown on the<br/>box.</p>

      <p>So lots of folk had heard the name McAvennie very few had seen me up close.</p>
      <p>TV cameras were absent as I banged in 18 League goals before Christmas to help the Hammers to their highest ever finish — third in the old First Division behind Liverpool and Everton.</p>
      <p>Martin Tyler, now a famous commentator, took me across London’s Waterloo Bridge for the Saint And Greavsie football show to see if passers-by could recognise me. Out of dozens of Londoners<br/>only one guy knew who I was.</p>
      <p>But plenty had heard of me.</p>
      <p>What really changed my life was being asked to go on the Terry Wogan show on a Friday night, in front of 23 million viewers.</p>
      <p>They also had Denis Law on the same night and they were actually comparing the two of us. Can you believe that?</p>
      <p>I cringe watching it. At the time I thought I looked great in the Cartier suit and the fancy tie, but to be honest I looked like a complete fud.</p>
      <p>But it’s been quite a journey. I’ve played for my boyhood heroes, Celtic, scoring the goals that clinched a famous league and cup double in their centenary season in 1988.</p>
      <p>I’ve played for my country in the World Cup and scored the goal that took us to Mexico in 1986.</p>

      <p>There’s also been sadness along the way and none more so than April this year when my pal big Billy McNeill passed away two years after his family revealed he was battling dementia.</p>
      <p>I had tears in my eyes when I spoke about Billy in an interview for The Scottish Sun online, to mark my 60th birthday.</p>
      <p>Sure, I used to drive him mad by turning up late to training every day.</p>
      <p>But he showed so much faith in me by persuading the old Celtic board to pay big money to bring me up from West Ham.</p>
      <p>Along with a few pals from the 1988 team, I went to visit him a few times and I was worried he wouldn’t remember me.</p>
      <p>But his wife Liz would say ‘Don’t worry he knows who you are’. Then he would hold my hand and squeeze it.</p>
      <p>I still called him gaffer right to the end. He’ll always be the gaffer. I loved him.</p>
      <p>Getting the chance to live the dream and play professional football was just great, but it also gave me the opportunity to work alongside true giants, like Cesar.</p>
      <p>And for that I’ll be forever grateful.</p>
      <p>ENDING up in court after an Old Firm bust up at Ibrox was undoubtedly one of the weirdest experiences of my life.</p>
      <p>The case famously became known as Goldilocks and the Three Bears when I joined Rangers trio Graham Roberts, Terry Butcher and Chris Woods at Glasgow Sheriff Court charged with conduct liable to lead to a breach of the peace.</p>

      <p>Yet the so-called scrap in the penalty box which saw three of us sent off shouldn’t even have resulted in yellow cards let alone red. It was classic handbags.</p>
      <p>Terry and Chris were later found guilty, while I was cleared and Graham was not proven.</p>
      <p>He elbowed me and asked: “What does that mean?” I told him: “They know you’re guilty but they can’t prove it!”</p>
      <p>It was a Friday so I bought them fish suppers while we were waiting on the verdict and told them to enjoy their Catholic steaks. They were English, of course, so had no idea what it meant.</p>
      <p>I’VE never been on Partick Thistle fans’ Christmas card list and, if I’m honest, I don’t blame them.</p>
      <p>I was about to join the Jags in 1994 when Celtic stepped in at the last minute and offered me a return to Paradise. And when I say the last minute, I mean it.</p>
      <p>I had just returned from playing in Hong Kong but the team over there refused to release my registration forms because of a wrangle over an unpaid phone bill.</p>
      <p>So I was on the centre circle at Firhill getting my picture taken wearing a Partick Thistle strip when they took a call in the office.</p>
      <p>It was Liam Brady, the Celtic manager, asking if I wanted to come back to Parkhead.</p>
      <p>I told him I would see him at Parkhead in an hour.</p>
      <p>I could understand why Thistle were angry but I hadn’t signed a contract anyway because of the wrangle over the phone bill.</p>
      <p>What was I supposed to do? I thought my chances of returning to my boyhood heroes had gone.</p>
      <p>When I went back as a Celtic player, the Thistle announcer completely ignored me when he was reading out the teams.</p>
      <p>So I responded by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win.</p>
      <p>I don’t take penalties usually, but I did that day.</p>
      <p>EVERYONE thought that I was born to live in London.</p>
      <p>It seemed natural to enjoy the bright lights and the celebrity lifestyle.</p>
      <p>But the truth is that I actually spent my first couple of months there trying to get back up to Glasgow.</p>
      <p>I had just joined West Ham from St Mirren as a young man and, to be honest, I was really homesick.</p>
      <p>London is a huge place and I was really lonely.</p>
      <p>So the manager John Lyall asked all the lads to organise a night out to help cheer me up and all of a sudden I found myself in Stringfellows nightclub for the first time.</p>
      <p>And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
