      <h1>Report: Tottenham battling Manchester United and Thomas Tuchel for Nicolo Zaniolo</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1208544/Tottenham-Roma-Nicolo-Zaniolo">The Daily Express have claimed</a> that Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly rivalling Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo, 20, is becoming renowned as one of the best young attacking midfielders in European football. This season, he has clocked up 16 appearances for Roma and scored five goals – including efforts against Milan, Napoli and Gladbach.</p>
      <p>His form for Roma has been so good that he has broken into Roberto Mancini’s flying Italy side, making five appearances in 2019 and scoring his first goals – in the form of a brace – in a 9-1 win over Armenia in the last international break.</p>
      <p>Spurs have long been linked with a move for Zaniolo, who can play out wide or in attacking midfield. The report claims Spurs see Zaniolo as the ideal long-term replacement for Christian Eriksen, who remains out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Tottenham will look to sign Zaniolo in January, but face competition from PSG and United. <a href="https://www.leggo.it/pay/roma_pay/a_vent_anni_gia_doppietta_in_azzurro_nessuno_e_come_lui-4873602.html">Italian outlet Leggo have claimed</a> the former Inter Milan academy player is worth £68.7million.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Zaniolo would be a stunning signing, but value is huge</h3>
      <p>There is no doubt that Zaniolo would be an excellent addition, and an even better one for Tottenham given that Eriksen is expected to leave. They would be replacing Eriksen with a player that has more potential than the Dane did at 20 years of age.</p>
      <p>But with the former Ajax star leaving for nothing, Spurs have got to raise all the funds from their cash reserves. So if they are to sign Zaniolo, they will have to spend an enormous £68million to nab the Italy star’s signature.</p>
      <p>It is an astronomical fee for a player who has just 52 appearances at senior level for Roma.</p>
