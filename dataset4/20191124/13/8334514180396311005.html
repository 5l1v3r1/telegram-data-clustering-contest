      <p>(Reuters) - Gian Franco Kasper, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS), has said he will step down from his position at the International Ski Congress in Thailand next year.</p>
      <p>Kasper was named secretary general of the federation in 1975 and elected as president in 1998.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Swiss will leave his post in May at the 52nd FIS congress, which will choose his replacement.</p>
      <p>Under his leadership, the number of ski and snowboard events has increased at the world championships and Olympics.</p>
      <p>The FIS has also grown from 100-member national associations to its current strength of 133.</p>
      <p>Kasper’s spell in charge, however, has come under scrutiny for his past controversial statements and his stance on environmental issues.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Kasper was forced to apologize for his comments after he compared the ban on Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics with the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.</p>
      <p>He was also criticized for questioning climate change in a Swiss newspaper interview last year and saying he would prefer to host events in dictatorships than to deal with environmentalists.</p>
      <p>In February, he said his comments were “not meant to be taken literally but this was not clear in the final story.”</p>
