      <p>The <b>Volkswagen Viloran</b> people mover has been unveiled at the <b>2019 Guangzhou motor show</b>.</p>
      <p>The Viloran is unlikely to ever come Down Under, and may only be built only in left-hand drive as it is built in China as part of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/">Volkswagen's</a> joint venture with SAIC, owner of the MG brand.</p>
      <p>When it goes on sale next year, the Viloran will compete with luxury people haulers, such as the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-lm/">Lexus LM</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/buick-gl8/">Buick GL8</a>.</p>
      <p>While people movers have never really caught on in Australia, they're still popular many parts of Asia â€“ and an important niche in China, the world's largest car market.</p>
      <p>Despite being one of China's most popular automotive brands, this is the first time Volkswagen has sold a full-sized people mover in the Middle Kingdom.</p>
      <p>At 5.3 metres long, it will be around 50mm longer than the market-leading Buick. It has crossover-inspired styling and a rounder silhouette with smoother surfacing than its boxier competitors.</p>
      <p>The key giveaway that it's a people mover are the twin sliding rear doors. The Viloran seats seven people in a 2-2-3 layout with captain's chairs for the second row.</p>
      <p>Reports indicate the Viloran is based on the company's MQB architecture for front- and all-wheel drive vehicles with a transverse engine. It is reportedly powered by a version of the company's <b>164kW/340Nm 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine.</b></p>
      <p>
