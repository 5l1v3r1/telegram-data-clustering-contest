      <p>A photographer was taken to hospital after a horse crashed through the railings at Navan racecourse today.</p>
      <p>A tight finish to the first race at the Meath venue took a nasty turn when Entoucas veered into the plastic rails after passing the winning post.</p>
      <p>The horse went into photographer Pat Healy who had to be attended to on the racetrack.</p>
      <p>Healy was said to be fully conscious following the incident but was taken to hospital for further observation.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Pugh, the IHRB chief medical officer, said: "Pat is doing really well and he will be taken to hospital now for further checks."</p>
      <p>The horse Entoucas got up on his feet and was okay after the nasty incident and so too was his jockey Mark Walsh.</p>
      <p>Local trainer Gordon Elliott won the race with Thatsy who just held off Entoucas by a neck.</p>
