      <h2>Both Rani Mukerji and Ranveer Singh were spotted wearing a similar Sabyasachi ensemble. Who do you think looked better?</h2>

      <p>Rani Mukerji, who is busy with promotions of her latest film, <i>Mardaani 2, </i>was recently spotted in a Sabyasachi ensemble. The actor was seen in a floral printed kurta which was teamed with a matching churidar. This was paired with a sheer dupatta and the look was rounded out with dark kohl eyes and hair tied.</p>

      <p>In case you think you have seen this outfit somewhere, well you are not wrong. Recently <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ranveer-singh/">Ranveer Singh</a> had stepped out wearing a very similar ensemble from the same designer while visiting the Golden Temple. He was with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/deepika-padukone/">Deepika Padukone</a> celebrating their first wedding anniversary. The <i>Gully Boy</i> actor was spotted in a floral printed kurta and churidar which he paired with a waistcoat. Singh is known for his flamboyant fashion choices and mostly for blurring the line between what women wear and what men do. And it was no different this time.</p>

      <p>While it is refreshing to note that outfits are no longer considered to be gender-specific, if there was a comparison between both the actor, we guess it is Singh who wins this round.</p>
      <p>Who do you think looked better?</p>
