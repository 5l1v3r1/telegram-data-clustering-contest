      <p>Uttar Pradesh (UP) Chief Minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath has directed all civil and police officials to ensure adequate security measures ahead of the Babri mosque demolition anniversary on 6 December.</p>
      <p>The anniversary is the first after the Supreme Court announced its verdict on 9 November, giving the entire disputed land to Hindus for temple construction and offered a five-acre land elsewhere for the mosque.</p>
      <p>Majority of the Muslim petitioners have rejected the offer of a five-acre plot of land for mosque and are planning to file a review petition against the top court's verdict.</p>
      <p>CM Yogi, who reviewed the security arrangements, said that all security arrangements will remain in place till 15 December. According to an official statement, the CM emphasized on regular foot patrolling, UP-112 patrolling and having regular interaction with peace committees and religious leaders.</p>
      <p>CM Yogi has also underlined the need for having CCTV cameras at religious places, commercial and industrial establishments, ATMs and banks and other vital installations.</p>
