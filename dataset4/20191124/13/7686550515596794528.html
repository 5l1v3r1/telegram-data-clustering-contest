      <p>Vue has banned gang film Blue Story from being shown at all of its venues after a brawl involving machetes broke out at a Birmingham cinema.</p>
      <p>Blue Story, a London gangland drama about two boys from different postcodes, was released in cinemas November 22.</p>
      <p>But this weekend, Vue announced it had pulled the film from all of its cinemas - including at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> - <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/gang-machetes-storm-cinema-birmingham-17307279">after violence broke out at a venue in Birmingham.</a></p>

      <p>A recorded message on the Vue answerphone says: "We regret that we will no longer be screening the film Blue Story at any of our venues.</p>
      <p>"Should you have a booking for this film, please say cancellation when prompted and a member of our team will be with you shortly to assist you with your booking."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/exclusive-vue-bans-blue-story-17307755">BirminghamLive</a> , the Star City multicomplex was on lockdown on Saturday (November 23) after mass violence broke out at its Vue cinema when a gang of "up to 100 youths" arrived with machetes.</p>
      <p>The cinema was packed with families waiting to see the Saturday opening of Frozen II.</p>
      <p>Officers seized two machetes and arrested a girl of just 13, a girl and a boy both aged 14 and a 19-year-old man on suspicion of assaulting police.</p>
      <p>A knife was also found at a roundabout near the complex.</p>
      <p>Seven police officers were attacked and suffered minor facial injuries.</p>

      <p>Supt Ian Green, from Birmingham Police, said: “This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night out at the cinema understandably frightened.</p>
      <p>“We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order."</p>
      <p>Blue Story was given a 15 certificate by the BBFC and said ‘very strong language, strong violence, threat, sex, drug misuse.’</p>
      <p>It said the film was ‘a drama in which a friendship between two boys is jeopardised by gang violence’ and that it has ‘passed the work uncut.’</p>
      <p>The BBFC added there was infrequent use of very strong language (‘c’) as well as strong language (‘f’) and other terms.</p>
      <p>As for the violence, the BBFC said there were ‘shootings and stabbings, with resultant bloody detail. It is implied that two men hold a victim’s arm, while a third attacker breaks it with a stamp.’</p>
