        <b>We played Rapid Fire with Neha Dhupia who took on every question and gave us some honest answers. SEE EXCLUSIVE VIDEO</b>
      </p>
      <p>Post the super success of her show #NoFilterNeha, actress Neha Dhupia has become a force to reckon with as the Podcast show is into its fourth season now. Even on the personal front, post marriage with Angad Bedi and a lovely daughter Mehr, Neha is on cloud nine.</p>
      <p>So, we got talking to the lovely lady whose post-pregnancy glow is pretty much intact. We did a fun rapid fire with Neha and we must admit that she was quite honest. We began by taking her back to her school and college days and asked her to name any subject in which she failed, to which the actress stated that she was poor at Math but never failed in any subject. <b>SEE VIDEO BELOW</b>.</p>

      <p>When did she kissed for the first time-.and after a lot of thought- Neha admitted that it was around the age of 20. What’s the sexiest thing about Neha and pat came the reply, “My mind”. Any particular cuss word for those who indulge in body-shaming? Without mouthing any cuss word, Neha asks them to simply get a life.</p>

      <p>We had done an interview on Neha's No Filter With Neha Show Season 4, hubby Angad and daughter Mehr. <b>SEE IT BELOW</b>.</p>

      <p>Next, we moved on to Bollywood and ask Neha to pick the Best Actor between Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor. She chose the latter. Similarly, we give her options and ask her to choose between Priyanka Chopra, Kangana Ranaut and Deepika Padukone. Neha rather picked her all-time favourite Kareena Kapoor Khan. We had done an interview on FASHION with Neha. <b>SEE IT BELOW.</b></p>

      <p>Who’s the sexiest Indian actress for Neha? Priyanka Chopra it is! If Neha had to rate between love, sex and money in the order of importance, what would feature on top of the list? Going in the same order, Neha says love first followed by sex and last would be money.</p>

      <p>Finally, we ask the actress if she has any cuss word for those who circulated rumours about Neha being pregnant before marriage. Neha replies, “I don’t have any message to send out to anyone. I’m in such a great place that nothing matters to me," she quipped.</p>
      <p>Now, why don't you see Neha Dhupia's RAPID FIRE round without any more delay, if you haven't seen it yet?<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- deccan herald, style.yahoo</i></p>
