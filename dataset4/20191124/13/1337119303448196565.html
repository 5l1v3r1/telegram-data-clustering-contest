      <h2>Deals on all the popular picks like AirPods and Galaxy Buds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chris-welch" target="_blank">Chris Welch</a></address>
      <p>With options like the Powerbeats Pro, Jaybird Vistas, Sony 1000XM3s, and the AirPods Pro, true wireless earbuds really came into their own in 2019. This is finally the year where you can buy a pair and be confident you won’t have to deal with connection problems, lackluster sound quality, or unreliable battery life.</p>
      <p>Many options on the market today can serve as your everyday, go-everywhere earbuds; you can take them on your commute, wear them at the gym, and wherever else you want to listen to your music or podcasts. Below are the best <a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deals available right now, followed by an overview of the top truly wireless earbuds of 2019. I’ll be updating everything throughout the week as offers come and go.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>Amazon Echo Buds</h4>
      <p><b>Battery life</b>: Up to 5 hours of continuous listening with noise reduction, up to 20 hours with case recharges<br/><b>Noise cancellation</b>: Yes (Bose active noise reduction) <br/><b>Wireless charging</b>: No<br/><b>Sweat/water resistance</b>: Yes</p>
      <p>Amazon swooped into the truly wireless market this fall with the Echo Bods, which feature Bose’s noise reduction technology and strong bass performance. They also support hands-free Alexa voice commands. As per usual with Amazon, the Echo Buds are priced extremely aggressively and are an excellent value — even when not on sale.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$129.99 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2DcArGc">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Famazon-echo-buds-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black%2F6381871.p%3FskuId%3D6381871">Best Buy</a></li>

      <p>The latest AirPods feature a revamped design and now come with silicone ear tips for a better, more secure fit. They also feature noise cancellation for the first time. Since they’re Apple’s latest pair, it’s unlikely you’ll see any mind-blowing deals on the AirPods Pro this holiday season. But even saving a few bucks off of the best AirPods yet is worth something.</p>

      <p>Beats’ first true wireless earbuds remain a top-recommended pick for their fantastic battery life, stable fit (thanks to the ear hook design), and robust durability. They come in a giant carrying case, but it’s easy enough to overlook this if you want the only true wireless earbuds cut out for the most extreme marathons. They’re also great day to day earbuds for the rest of us.</p>

      <p>For a long time, Jabra’s 65t earbuds were the go-to alternative for people who couldn’t get AirPods to fit right. They remain a solid option, but have recently been replaced by the new 75t earbuds. Aside from making a switch to USB-C, the new model offers improved audio performance and a significant upgrade to battery life.</p>

      <p>The Jaybird Vistas are some of my favorite earbuds if you want a reliable connection, sweat resistance, a design that doesn’t draw attention, and one of the most compact carrying cases around — and all of those things come at a very good price. The Vistas now come in several colors including black, light gray, and blue.</p>

      <p>It took Sony a few tries, but its third pair of truly wireless earbuds deliver good noise cancellation, fantastic sound quality, and a comfortable fit. They lack water resistance, however, so these are better suited for listening scenarios where you won’t be getting sweaty.</p>
