      <p>If you've been holding out on a new Xbox in the hopes of a price crash before the holidays, now's the time to pounce on this Black Friday Xbox One deal. For just $149 you can pick up the Xbox One S All Digital edition, but what we're really excited about is this 1TB Xbox One S with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for just $199. </p>
      <p>While $149 for the All Digital Edition is a great <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> price, and certainly one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on a brand new console, we can't help but feel that you'd be missing out not spending the extra $50 for the flagship device. </p>
      <p>The Xbox One S All Digital Edition is, as you may have guessed, a fully digital console - there's no disc drive to speak of so you'll have to download all your games. For many this experience suits just fine - whether that's down to a preference for not having to dig out a physical disc before playing a game, or because you just want to explore the huge downloads selection offered via a neat <a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/cheapest-xbox-game-pass-deals-prices">Game Pass deal</a>. </p>
      <p>That said, having the option to play from a disc is never a bad thing, and can save you cash in the long term on second-hand game sales, or if you're more of a collector for whom ownership comes in the form of a good old box and disc. So, if you ever think you might want to take advantage of game trade-ins, refunds, or simply cheap preowned pick ups, you'll want to spring for the main console in this Black Friday Xbox One deal.</p>
      <p>Plus, you're not just getting an Xbox console in this deal. If you purchase the main Xbox One S bundle you'll also get a copy of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order - a brand new game that carries a $60 price tag by itself. If you were going to pick up this title anyway, you're actually getting that brand new console for just $140. Sure, you'll also find some game codes in your Xbox One S All Digital Edition bundle, but you can pick up Minecraft, Sea of Thieves, and some Fortnite DLC for so cheap right now, you'd be better off going all in on a newer game. </p>
      <p>These Black Friday Xbox One deals have come in a little early, but you're getting a bottom line price on these bundles so we'd be surprised to find them much cheaper over the coming week. There are always more <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/walmart-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-2019">Walmart Black Friday deals</a> to peruse, so make sure you take note of all the best savings before checkout.</p>
