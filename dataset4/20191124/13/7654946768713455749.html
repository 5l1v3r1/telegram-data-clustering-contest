      <h1>NFL picks for Week 12: Giants will lose by at least a TD to Bears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:01:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Blezow</a></address>
      <p>Sunday at Soldier Field, it’s the stoppable force against the moveable object.</p>
      <p>The Bears come into their game against the Giants averaging a meager 16.9 points per game. On their first series last Sunday night in a 17-7 loss at the Rams, Eddy Pineiro missed a 48-yard field goal. Next possession, coach Matt Nagy went for it on fourth-and-9 from the Rams’ 31 and Mitchell Trubisky threw incomplete. On the third series, Nagy tried a field goal on fourth-and-6 from the Rams’ 29 and Pineiro missed again from 47 yards.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to coach when the options are bad and worse. The Bears went 11-3 in games Trubisky started in the 2018 regular season. He even threw for 303 yards in the playoff game against the Eagles, which was lost on Cody Parkey’s infamous “double-doink” field-goal miss.</p>
      <p>But this season, Chicago is 4-5 when Trubisky starts, and has scored 16 points or fewer in six of those games. People who might have forgotten are remembering the Bears drafted him instead of Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson. Oops.</p>
      <p>The Bears still have an excellent defense, led by Khalil Mack and Roquan Smith, and it could end up being a terrible matchup for the Giants if Daniel Jones continues to fumble the ball. And there’s also a possibility the Giants’ defense can be what cures Trubisky. The Giants have given up at least 27 points in every game except one this season.</p>
      <p><b>The pick:</b> Bears, -6.</p>
      <p><b>NEW YORK JETS (+3) over OAKLAND Raiders:</b> The early Eastern start is a bad body-clock game for the Raiders, but I wouldn’t count on a Jon Gruden team showing up half asleep. Rather, it’s the Jets’ No. 1 rushing defense that could slow down Josh Jacobs and force Derek Carr to throw more. It won’t be awful conditions, but 48 degrees and potentially wet are not Carr’s favorite conditions. The Jets won’t keep scoring 34 points per game as they did against the Giants and Redskins … but the Raiders do give up 25 ppg.</p>
      <p><b>CLEVELAND BROWNS (-10¹/₂) over Miami Dolphins:</b> Miami cut RB Mark Walton, who’d been arrested for alleged domestic violence, and now its current leading rusher is Kalen Ballage, who averages 1.9 yards per carry. This is a lot of points, but it’s also a long game when Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt, Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry go up against a defense that yields 394.3 yards per game.</p>
      <p><b>Denver Broncos (+4) over BUFFALO BILLS:</b> This number was bet down from an opener of 5¹/₂, so the value might already be gone on the Broncos. Denver is 3-7 and could be crushed by its 27-23 loss at Minnesota last week, in which the Broncos blew a 20-0 lead. But that first half showed Denver can compete with a good team on the road.</p>

      <p><b>CINCINNATI BENGALS (+6¹/₂) over Pittsburgh Steelers:</b> Bengals are 0-10 and have been at their worst at home, but do have covers against the Seahawks, Bills, Ravens and Raiders. Steelers could be down JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Conner and definitely will be without center Maurkice Pouncey, who was suspended for kicking Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p><b>NEW ORLEANS SAINTS (-9¹/₂) over Carolina Panthers:</b> Carolina is 1-3 in its last four with average scores or 15 ppg for, 31 ppg against. Both teams have gotten crushed at home by the Falcons in the last two weeks. Just have way more confidence in Drew Brees and his cohorts than Kyle Allen and his.</p>
      <p><b>ATLANTA FALCONS (-4¹/₂) over Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</b> Tampa Bay hasn’t covered a spread since its out-of-nowhere victory at the Rams on Sept. 29. Atlanta is coming off wins of 26-9 at New Orleans and 29-3 at Carolina. Sometimes teams just figure it out.</p>
      <p><b>Detroit Lions (-3¹/₂) over WASHINGTON REDSKINS:</b> If that viral video of Dwayne Haskins chewing out his offensive line accurately portrays what they think of him, then it’s going to be another long, hard day for the Redskins’ struggling rookie quarterback. Impressed with Matthew Stafford’s replacement, Jeff Driskel, so far.</p>
      <p><b>Seattle Seahawks (+1¹/₂) over PHILADELPHIA EAGLES:</b> Game got flexed from Sunday night to 1 p.m., making it a bad body-clock game for the Seahawks. But Seattle is coming off a bye and is a professional, well-coached team. While Philly’s defense looked improved versus the Patriots, the Seahawks have a lot of ways to attack, including Russell Wilson’s scrambling.</p>
      <p><b>TENNESSEE TITANS (-3) over Jacksonville Jaguars:</b> In Week 3, the Jaguars sacked Marcus Mariota nine times in a 20-7 win in Jacksonville. Much has changed. Mariota was benched in favor of Ryan Tannehill. Nick Foles has returned for the Jags, replacing Gardner Minshew. From a season-wide view, it’s an extremely even matchup, but going with the revenge motive.</p>
      <p><b>NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS (-6¹/₂) over Dallas Cowboys:</b> Even after falling behind 10-0, the Patriots won by a touchdown in Philadelphia. Now they get the Cowboys in Foxborough laying a bit less. After-dark temperatures at Gillette should be in the 30s with some moisture, accentuating the edges Tom Brady and Bill Belichick already possess.</p>
      <p><b>Green Bay Packers (+3) over SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS:</b> This line has not dropped under three despite heavy public money on the Packers, which suggests the 49ers are the sharp side at that number. Still, the 49ers are loaded with key injuries (Matt Breida, Emmanuel Sanders, George Kittle), and the Pack comes in fresh off a late-season bye.</p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p><b>Baltimore Ravens (-3) over LOS ANGELES RAMS:</b> Lamar Jackson and the Ravens have run roughshod over some good defenses, scoring 30 points at Seattle, 37 against the Patriots and 41 versus the Texans in recent weeks. The Rams have turned up the screws on defense of late and should be getting Brandin Cooks back. Tough call at this price, but have to lean to Jackson against a team that has yet to see him.</p>
      <p><b>Best bets</b>: Lions, Seahawks, Bears.<br/><b>Lock of the week:</b> Lions (Locks 4-7 in 2019).<br/><b>Last week:</b> 6-8 overall, 1-2 Best Bets.<br/><b>Thursday night:</b> Texans (W).</p>
