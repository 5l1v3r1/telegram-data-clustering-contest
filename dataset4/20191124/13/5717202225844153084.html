      <h1>Report: Arsenal, West Ham and Wolves want Southampton defender Cedric Soares</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:42:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-west-ham-to-pip-arsenal-to-defensive-addition-in-january">TeamTalk have reported</a> that West Ham United are set to make a January offer to sign Southampton defender Cedric Soares, but face competition from Arsenal and Wolves as the Portuguese star looks set to leave.</p>
      <p>Cedric, 28, has managed just five Premier League appearances this season though he did play in the 2-2 draw against Arsenal on Saturday afternoon. The Euro 2016 winner is out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The German-born Portugal international has plenty of interest on the horizon, with Arsenal and Wolves keen to land the defender on a pre-contract basis. But the Hammers are looking to go one step further and land him in January.</p>
      <p>It means the east Londoners will have to part with a transfer fee, although that figure is likely to be a small one given Southampton will want to cash in rather than losing Cedric for nothing in the summer.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Cedric is the perfect January addition for West Ham</h3>
      <p>West Ham desperately need a right-back. Pablo Zabaleta’s lack of pace and elder years were shown in the 3-2 defeat to Newcastle prior to the international break, as Allan Saint-Maximin tore the Argentine to shreds.</p>
      <p>Ryan Fredericks is West Ham’s other option but the defender has failed to live up to the hype since his signing, struggling with injury and the quality of the Premier League. Bringing Cedric in for a bargain fee would be excellent Hammers business.</p>
