      <p>The lights were officially turned on at 5pm on Saturday, with Su Pollard, Dicky Dodd and the Mayor of Wolverhampton in charge of the honours in Queen Square.</p>
      <p>Su, who is starring as Queen Rat in the Dick Whittington pantomime at the Grand Theatre, said: said: "It's so lovely to see so many people here in the Christmas spirit.</p>
      <p>"It brings communities together. And Christmas shopping can be a bit tedious but this makes it better.</p>
      <p>"I really like Wolverhampton, the people are very warm and welcoming just the same as the first time I came here in 1974."</p>
      <p>Mayor Claire Darke added: "The event is fabulous as it brings everyone together in Wolverhampton to watch the Christmas lights being switched on.</p>
      <p>"It's a great event and a great celebration of the pantomime.</p>
      <p>"It's a great start for the Christmas shopping season with the market and shops being open late too."</p>
      <p>The day started with a free screening of film The Polar Express on the stage in Queen Square, a funfair and festive market in Dudley Street.</p>
      <p>Father Christmas was in his Mander Centre grotto and families were queueing up to meet real reindeer on the city streets.</p>
      <p>And Tettenhall Rotary's new Santa sleigh was by the funfair for children to pose for pictures.</p>
      <p>Signal 107 DJ Dicky Dodd said he was proud to be hosting the switch-on.</p>
      <p>He said: "We've been lucky with the weather but it's always a great turn out here.</p>
      <p>"People have come to support the community and enjoy Wolverhampton again.</p>
      <p>"It's a great family event and this is when Christmas starts in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud to be hosting it because I'm born and bred Wolverhampton, so it's a real privilege for me."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile parents Mike and Sally Richardson were watching sons Jacob, seven, and Harry, five, enjoy one of the fair rides.</p>
      <p>Sally, a clerical assistant from the city, said: "It's the first time we've been to the switch-on, but the boys are loving all the rides.</p>
      <p>"They liked seeing the reindeer too, it's made them very excited for Christmas."</p>
      <p>And Wendy Reynolds, from Wednesfield, was with her mother Rita Aldridge and two children Georgina and Alice.</p>
      <p>She said: "We go to lots of the light switch-on events, we've been shopping too.</p>
      <p>"The children aren't keen on shopping but they can go on the rides afterwards."</p>
