      <p>MONTEVIDEO, Nov 24 — Uruguayans headed to the polls today to elect a new president in a second round run-off vote likely to shift the South American nation back towards the right after around 15 years of liberal rule.</p>
      <p>Luis Lacalle Pou, a conservative lawyer whose father is a former president, is favorite to topple the long-standing coalition that has led the farm-driven economy through a period of stability and relative, though recently cooling, growth.</p>
      <p>Some 2.7 million Uruguayan voters will choose between Lacalle Pou of the center-right National Party and Daniel Martínez of the ruling Broad Front party. Polls close at 7.30pm local time (2230 GMT).</p>
      <p>The first results will come in around an hour later.</p>
      <p>As pre-election campaigns closed last week Lacalle Pou, a 46-year-old, had struck a confident tone, saying the South American country was demanding change. Pre-election polls show him beating Martinez by a margin of 6-8 points.</p>
      <p>“It’s the people... saying ‘I want to shake up the government’s drowsiness and change it,’” said Lacalle Pou, who became the front-runner after striking deals with a string of allies following an October first round.</p>
      <p>Martinez, a 62-year-old former Montevideo mayor, has said the five-party coalition against him is simply an attempt to dislodge the liberal government that has overseen continuous growth, though seen a recent slowdown.</p>
      <p>He has also warned about “fundamentalist” policies taking Uruguay sharply to the right, “ending up like in Argentina or Brazil.”</p>
      <p>Amid wider regional unrest in Bolivia and Chile, Uruguay remains stable, but a slowing economy saw growth of just 0.1 per cent in the second quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>Unemployment has also edged up to 9.2 per cent versus a year earlier, while inflation this year so far has been 8.36 per cent. — Reuters</p>
