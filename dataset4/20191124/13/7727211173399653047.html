      <h1>Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis says you should not ignore private parking tickets</h1>
      <h2>He told ITV This Morning viewers that he was misheard</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:23:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Martin Lewis has moved to put an end to rumours that he said you don't have to pay private parking tickets.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/money-saving-expert">Money Saving Expert</a> told presenters <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/holly-willoughby">Holly Willoughby</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/phillip-schofield">Phillip Schofield</a> on ITV's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/this-morning">This Morning</a> it was a Facebook post that misquoted him.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old appeared on the daytime TV show to answer viewers' money questions when one caller asked about private parking tickets - which are different to council tickets.</p>
      <p>Vicky said: "I've had a parking ticket sent to me in the post from a private company, my dad said that he'd heard that as it's private I don't have to pay it. Please can you give me some advice?</p>

      <p>Martin said: "That's our fault. That's incorrect information, it's our fault, because we did it on this show a few years ago, someone misheard, did a Facebook post about it that was then shared 300,000 times - and I've been trying to correct this one ever since. So I am quite glad of that correction.</p>
      <p>"What I say is, private parking tickets are invoices. So if they're unfair invoices you don't have to pay them.</p>
      <p>"But I would always inform them that you believe they're unfair, if they have an appeals system go back through the appeals system.</p>
      <p>"If they don't, write back and say it's unfair, and why you think it is.</p>
      <p>"I would not ignore them and I have never taken that stance.</p>
      <p>"Some militant anti-parking campaigners do take that stance, I don't because judges have said to me 'well, if you ignore them, we don't look well on it if they take you to court in the end'.</p>
      <p>"There are guides online about what to do with private parking tickets, but I am not a fan of ignoring them, contrary to what that hugely shared Facebook post said, never my words."</p>
      <p>He said you should go to the private firm and tell them it is unfair and tell them all the reasons why, such as small signage and ask them to reply.</p>
      <p>Or some private parking companies have an appeals process.</p>
      <p>Martin added: "Ignoring the letter, it works for some people, but it is very risky."</p>
