      <h2>Stars including Gemma Collins and Vicky Pattison have praised Samantha and Charlotte Ryder's boob tape invention, which can support a range of cup sizes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:07:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Vickie Scullard, Anna Ye</a></address>
      <p>Twin sisters claim a nifty boob tape creation that promises the same results as a surgical breast lift is set to make a million pounds.</p>
      <p>The average boob job costs more than £6,000, so it's not really an option for those on a budget.</p>
      <p>But twins Samantha and Charlotte Ryder, 28, from Stockport have come up with an invention that will offer women perkier breasts - for as little as £12.99.</p>
      <p>The sisters say their product Lift &amp; Shape Tape from Perky Pear is not overly sticky nor uncomfortable and will not fall off due to sweat, reports <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/perky-pear-tape-stockport-sisters-17249800">Manchester Evening News</a> .</p>
      <p>And most importantly, they say it works for a range of boob sizes, from cups A to G.</p>

      <p>The sisters' boob stickers have already been praised by a whole host of celebrities, including This Morning host Holly Willoughby, Geordie Shore's Vicky Pattison and Towie star Gemma Collins. They are also being sold on popular online retailers Pretty Little Thing and Boohoo.</p>
      <p>Samantha said: “I have always had naturally big boobs.</p>
      <p>"Aged 13, I was already a C-cup.</p>
      <p>"When you’re that young and see older guys leering over you, it’s not nice, and my boobs kept growing, making some clothes impossible to wear comfortably. </p>
      <p>“But it wasn’t until 2016 that I realised I needed a bit of help with lift.</p>
      <p>"I was newly single and started going out more often and at that time low cut tops were in fashion.</p>

      <p>“I hadn’t worn anything like that for a long time and my boobs had changed in that time, so I felt like I couldn’t wear them without some serious support.”</p>
      <p>Samantha, who has a background in design, said she struggled to find any suitable boob tape for her ample E-cups, so she decided to make her own.</p>
      <p>She said: “Nothing that was on the market at the time worked. I tried everything.</p>
      <p>“I had tried so many things before I made my own - I even used duct tape, which was really painful.</p>
      <p>"Especially if you’re putting tape over tape over tape.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t want a hack, I needed a solution.</p>

      <p>“My grandma used to be a physio and she had some strong tape and my brother hurt his knee.</p>
      <p>"I remember looking at it and thinking, that would work perfectly for my boobs."</p>
      <p>She continued: “Using my grandmother’s tape I cut it into a shape that I thought would look good,” she explained.</p>
      <p>“I wanted something sweat proof, so made sure there are gaps in the adhesive so that sweat doesn’t build up under the adhesive, and the tape stays on until you want to take it off.</p>
      <p>“I came up with the perfect shape that cups and fully lifts and is rounded, with no pointy corners.</p>
      <p>"Then, in 2017 I started looking for manufacturers.”</p>

      <p>The company is a family effort, with sister Charlotte joining three months after the Perky Pear tape was launched. Their mum then joined after working as a manager for 20 years.</p>
      <p>Samantha said: “At first, I was working in my mum’s living room and was inundated with orders.</p>
      <p>“Now we have four offices, a team of 11 and 40 staff in the factory.</p>
      <p>"It’s mad to think that I started out making this for myself and now we’re set to break a million by the end of the year.”</p>
      <p>The brand is the first cotton-based breast lift tape which offers the same results as a surgical breast lift. Samantha has described the tape as a "flat pack boob job".</p>
      <p>She explained: “Some might only see it as a tape but it’s so much more than that.</p>

      <p>“I know the struggles myself - it can help change your whole wardrobe.</p>
      <p>"When you put it on your posture and silhouette changes, it gives the wearer confidence.</p>
      <p>“We have a 47 per cent returning customer rate, and that proves that they love it.</p>
      <p>"They’re very loyal to us.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of customers saying that they feel different since using it.</p>
      <p>"We say it’s like a flat pack boob job."</p>
      <p>Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison has made an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> video praising the tape. The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE) star Gemma Collins has also posted on social media about how happy she is with the sisters' creation.</p>
      <p>The brand is continuing to grow and will launch in the US next year after a cash injection from American investors.</p>
      <p>Samantha said: "We have already hit the million mark and next year we will have grown 500 per cent organically.</p>

      <p>"Since the investment, from the US directors the brand has grown massively.</p>
      <p>“Looking ahead, we want to extend the range a bit.</p>
      <p>"We currently have black and nude colours but quite a lot of customers are requesting a brown shade.</p>
      <p>“We’re not trying to make skin colours as such, but we appreciate that some people would prefer a more natural shade dependent on their skin colour.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about what it is like to work with her sister, Samantha said: “We do bicker from time to time but we’re best friends.</p>
      <p>“One of the great things about having a twin is, when people go into business and say they wish they could split themselves in two so they get more done, well I can do that.</p>
      <p>“It’s both our business, I don’t think it could have grown in the way it has without the two of us.”</p>
