        <b>Munster captain Peter O’Mahony has praised the performance of out-half JJ Hanrahan during his side’s Champions Cup draw with Racing 92 in Thomond Park on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Kerry man kicked 11 of Munster’s 21-point haul, including a <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/smcmahon/munster-racing-92-salvage-dramatic-draw/">monster conversion to level the game following Andrew Conway’s late try</a>.</p>
      <p>Hanrahan had an opportunity to steal the win for Johann van Graan’s men in the dying seconds following good build-up play, however, his drop goal attempt drifted wide.</p>
      <p>O’Mahony was quick to praise his teammate on his return from injury and maintains he should not be disappointed following the game.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, back from an injury and an 80-minute performance. He kicked an incredible conversion to get us two points… they’re pressure kicks, you know? That fella trains harder than anyone.</p>
      <blockquote>“He’d be disappointed himself after but he shouldn’t be. I thought he had a class performance and that conversion was certainly out of the top drawer.”</blockquote>
      <p>The result means Munster now have seven points in Pool 4 of the <a href="https://www.epcrugby.com/champions-cup/matches/pool-tables/">Heineken Champions Cup</a>, level with the French outfit. While the province had their opportunities to win the game, O’Mahony is aware that their situation could have been much worse had they not earned the two points.</p>
      <p>He maintains that the side will take great encouragement from their comeback from a seven-point deficit.</p>

      <p>“Around 50 or 52 minutes, we were on the ropes and we stuck at it, stayed at it, showed up defensively in important moments, got the ball back with a couple of big plays and got ourselves down there.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re never a team to roll over, particularly not at home and we ground out the two points, which will stand to us.”</blockquote>
      <p>Saturday’s game in Limerick marked the final appearance in a Munster jersey for Alby Mathewson who leaves the province after a 15-month stint.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand native replaced Conor Murray in the 61st minute to great applause from the home fans and made an impressive impact in the game.</p>

      <p>O’Mahony admits that the squad will miss his presence in the dressing room as well as his performances on the field.</p>
      <p>“He has contributed from the moment he arrived to his last game. I spoke about him inside, he was a standard-setter from the minute he arrived, training-wise, competitive-wise.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good guy to have around the squad, good around young fellas, good to sit and have a chat with, just a good person.</p>
      <p>“He fitted in incredibly well and we’re very grateful for his effort and we’ll be sad to see him go. I was chatting to the lads last night, you’ll miss him around, he’s good craic.”</p>
