      <h2>The Tory leader was probably hoping for a quiet journey to his general election manifesto launch in Telford - but dozens of protesters were waiting for him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:54:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson arrived for the Conservative Party General Election manifesto launch to find a noisy protest waiting for him outside.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader travelled to Telford today to unveil his plan for the next five years, if he wins the election.</p>
      <p>But dozens of angry voters stood outside the venue, booing and jeering as the Tory battle bus arrived.</p>
      <p>Protesters held signs complaining about Tory plans for the NHS and climate change.</p>
      <p>Some posters were specifically complaining about plans to downgrade A&amp;E services at local hospitals.</p>
      <p>And there was one large banner from Stand Up To Racism.</p>
      <p>On the fence surrounding the complex, someone had tied a bedsheet with "TORIES OUT" painted on it in black letters.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson is set to unveil his election manifesto today in Telford, a Leave-voting area of the West Midlands, which will establish a "triple tax lock" but will also scrap hospital charges for millions and invest £1 billion in childcare.</p>

      <p>Overall, the Tories said today their manifesto will announce:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>No rise in Income Tax, National Insurance or VAT</b> for five years</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>£78m a year to fund partial free NHS hospital parking for a select few</b> in 'vulnerable groups' - disabled people, frequent outpatient attendees, gravely ill patients, visitors to relatives who have an extended stay in hospital or their carers, and staff on night shifts</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Raise threshold for National Insurance to £9,500 next year,</b> which he says will mean a £100 tax cut for 31 million workers - though experts say it won't help the poorest who already don't pay NI</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Keep pensions triple lock, winter fuel payment and the older person’s bus pass</b>
          </p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>£1bn for extra childcare on school premises</b> after lessons and during holidays in a bid to get 250,000 more primary school children onsite childcare over the summer. This is £250m a year for 3 years to boost term-time and holiday provision in schools; and £250m capital for the first year to kick-start the plan by getting staff, equipment or premises</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>£6.3bn making social housing more energy efficient</b>
          </p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Keep energy price cap</b>
          </p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>New ban on exporting plastic waste</b> to poorer countries outside OECD</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>£2bn over four years for a national programme to fill potholes</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chancellor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp">Sajid Javid</a> promised the document would be the"most transparent" explanation of how the policies would be paid for ever seen in "British electoral history".</p>
      <p>The senior Cabinet minister said it would be explained in a "very detailed costings document", published alongside the manifesto, how investment was to be paid for given that tax rises had been ruled out.</p>
