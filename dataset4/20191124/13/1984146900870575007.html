      <p>Newcastle United fans were talking about Jarrod Bowen again after the Hull City forward scored twice at Middlesbrough to cap another fine performance.</p>
      <p>Bowen’s excellent form continued with a double at the Riverside to confirm his potential <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-linked-jarrod-bowen-17129928">ahead of a January transfer window</a> where Hull’s resolve may well be tested.</p>
      <p>So where does interest stand?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bowen-carroll-saint-maximin-newcastle-17133937">They weighed up a potential move in the summer</a> but opted against it due to valuation and the club had other targets closer. But with his contract moving into its final 18 months – Hull have an option to extend the deal that expires in the summer – they may need to cash in as Bowen stalls on a further extension.</p>
      <p>Sources claim Newcastle are near the front of the queue for the player and Bruce is keen.</p>
      <p>United have scouted the Championship star extensively and are definitely interested in Bowen. His age profile, ability and likely potential to improve make him the sort of player that Newcastle might push their financial parametes for.</p>
      <p>Whether they move in January or not – when the player’s value will be at a premium with the Tigers unlikely to want to sell – will depend on how Hull peg his price. But there’s a live interest for Bruce, who did have the player at Hull.</p>
      <p>Newcastle aren’t alone in looking at him – Spurs have checked him out recently – but they appear, at the moment, the club who have made the most serious overtures.</p>
      <p>Of his own future, Bowen has said: "If I leave, I leave, if I don’t, I am loving it here. What will be, will be.</p>
      <p>"I have just got to keep my head down, I have got agents that take care of all of that.</p>
