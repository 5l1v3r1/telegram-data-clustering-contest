      <h2>Wilder had lost each of the first six rounds to the tricky Cuban in their heavyweight world title rematch on Saturday night</h2>

      <p>Tyson Fury’s trainer dismissed concerns about Deontay Wilder’s freak power after his devastating KO of Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>Wilder had lost each of the first six rounds to the tricky Cuban in their heavyweight world title rematch on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>But he detonated a stunning right hand in the dying embers of the seventh session to set up a February rematch with Fury.</p>
      <p>The Brit’s trainer Ben Davison was ringside in Las Vegas and believes his man will prove a far greater test than Ortiz.</p>
      <p>“I’ve said before, Luis Ortiz is a fantastic fighter but he’s not <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> ,” he told Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>“I also learned that he [Wilder] was a different man fight week to what he was to when he fought Tyson.</p>
      <p>“Tyson 100 per cent got under his skin, I definitely saw that in there, which is pretty understandable.</p>
      <p>“The pressure of a big fight around the corner affected him.</p>

      <p>“People will say he looked poor, but he took his time and he did what he was supposed to do.”</p>
      <p>Fury was dropped twice by Wilder last December but recovered on both occasions to hear the final bell.</p>
      <p>But despite doing enough to win the fight, the challenger was denied victory when the judges scored the bout a draw.</p>
      <p>And Davison is confident he will have the game plan to complete the job early next year.</p>

      <p>“Obviously his power is something you have to negate,’ he said.</p>
      <p>“Mentally, Tyson is the strongest fighter I’ve come across in history and he’s proved that on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>“How do we do it? I’m not going to say my ideas on how you would do it. But it’s definitely not what Luis Ortiz just did there.</p>
      <p>“Fair play to him, he had a good go but he got complacent and walked straight into distance. That’s a recipe for disaster.”</p>
