      <p>EastEnders is set to pay tribute to the soap legend Dame Barbara Windsor by naming a new Walford resident after her infamous character Peggy Mitchell. Peggy’s granddaughter Louise Mitchell (played by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tilly-keeper/">Tilly Keeper</a>) is pregnant with Keanu Taylor’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danny-walters/">Danny Walters</a>) baby and is due to give birth in upcoming weeks, with the unborn infant to be christened after the late Queen Vic landlord.</p>
      <p>Barbara’s husband Scott Mitchell revealed the actress was thrilled by the soap’s decision and it made her ‘quite emotional’.</p>
      <p>He admitted: ‘She thought what a lovely thing it is Peggy Mitchell will live on in a family member. What a lovely tribute.</p>
      <p>‘It made her quite emotional and I have been reminding her each time we watch the show every night.’</p>
      <p>Scott added to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10410063/eastenders-bosses-tribute-barbara-windsor-naming-shows-latest-arrival/">The Sun</a>: ‘Each time her whole face lights up.’</p>

      <p>Babs’ Peggy first arrived in Albert Square back in 1994, having taken over the role from Jo Warne.</p>

      <p>She was a major character on the soap with a number of huge storylines, such as her failed relationship with Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) and her on/off friendship with Pat Evans (Pam St Clement), and of course had the iconic catchphrase ‘get out of my pub’.</p>
      <p>Peggy bowed out of EastEnders in 2016 when it was revealed she had refused her cancer treatment. She later took her own life in a bid to not be beaten by the illness she was facing.</p>

      <p>Barbara stepped out of the limelight two years prior to her departure after being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/10/dame-barbara-windsor-diagnosed-alzheimers-age-80-7534271/">diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite battling the degenerative brain condition, Scott revealed last month that the 82-year-old has kept onto her humour.</p>
      <p>‘The thing that we know about dementia and Alzheimer’s is that it’s a progressive illness, so you know you’re heading in one direction,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘So, yes, things progress but she still has that wonderful sense of humour, she can still laugh and have a giggle and watch telly, and we go out occasionally.’</p>
