      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a>'s men got back to winning ways on Saturday when they came from behind to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/man-city-vs-chelsea_game_92631.html">beat Chelsea 2-1</a> courtesy of goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kevin-de-bruyne/"><b>Kevin De Bruyne</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/riyad-mahrez/"><b>Riyad Mahrez</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Shakhtar, meanwhile, maintained their sizeable lead at the top of the Ukrainian Premier League with a 4-1 win over FC Lviv on Friday.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how City could line up for Tuesday's showdown.</p>

      </p>
      <p>City were able to welcome back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ederson/"><b>Ederson</b></a> in goal for their game with Chelsea at the weekend and the Brazilian is set to continue on Tuesday, especially with backup stopper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/claudio-bravo/"><b>Claudio Bravo</b></a> suspended after his red card <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/atalanta-bc-vs-man-city_game_96716.html">against Atalanta</a> earlier in the month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bernard-mendy/"><b>Bernard Mendy</b></a> is expected to continue at left-back, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kyle-walker/"><b>Kyle Walker</b></a> should replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joao-cancelo/"><b>Joao Cancelo</b></a> at right-back after being rested on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolas-otamendi/"><b>Nicolas Otamendi</b></a> was also confined to the bench for the Chelsea game but he is likely to start against Shakhtar, partnering <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-stones/"><b>John Stones</b></a> at the heart of the City defence.</p>
      <p>Rodri and David Silva both went off at the weekend with cramp but both should be available for Tuesday's game, leaving Guardiola with a difficult choice of who to pick to go alongside De Bruyne in the midfield three.</p>
      <p>Summer signing Rodri is more likely to start, with Silva probably an option off the bench with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ilkay-gundogan/"><b>Ilkay Gundogan</b></a> deputising in his place.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bernardo-silva/"><b>Bernardo Silva</b></a> is available for Tuesday's game after serving his one-match suspension for a tweet he sent to Mendy earlier in the season but Mahrez's impressive showing against Chelsea means that he'll probably continue on the right, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raheem-sterling/"><b>Raheem Sterling</b></a> on the left and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gabriel-jesus/"><b>Gabriel Jesus</b></a> replacing the injured Sergio Aguero up front.</p>
