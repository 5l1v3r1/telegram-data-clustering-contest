      <p>We’re All Over OMV</p>
      <p>Oil Free Otago media release 24 November 2019</p>
      <p>Oil Free Otago and Extinction Rebellion supporters are today on board the OMV hench boat the Skandi Atlantic in Timaru with Greenpeace members.</p>
      <p>“People from all walks of life have come at short notice to help stop OMV’s drilling plans” said Oil Free Otago’s Rosemary Penwarden.</p>
      <p>”I’m in a pipe lock on the upper deck with John, an architect. Also on board from Dunedin are a senior university lecturer, a mental health worker, students and grandparents. We have taken time out to put our bodies in the way of OMV’s plans to drill for more oil and gas in a climate emergency.”</p>
      <p>OMV is one of the hundred companies responsible for more than 70% of global emissions and plans to drill soon in the Great South Basin.</p>
      <p>John said “We ride bikes, we compost, we conserve electricity. Yet companies like OMV make a mockery of all our efforts by continuing to drill for more planet-destroying fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>“We’re prepared to stay for as long as it takes. We will do everything we can to stop OMV in their tracks.” Rosemary added.</p>
