      <p>Egyptian news outlet Mada Masr said Sunday security forces had raided their Cairo offices a day after one of its editors was arrested.</p>
      <p>“Plainclothes security forces have raided Mada Masr’s office in Cairo. Staff are currently being held inside, and their phones have been switched off,” the independent news site posted on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The raid comes after Shady Zalat, 37, a news editor who has worked since 2014 at the prominent website was arrested from his home on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mada Masr publishes investigations into corruption and security issues in Arabic and English.</p>
      <p>It published an explosive article last week alleging that President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi’s son Mahmoud had been transferred to Moscow on a diplomatic posting.</p>
      <p>His re-assignment from a senior intelligence post came after he had been criticised internally within the security apparatus, Mada Masr reported.</p>
      <p>The article, which cited unnamed Emirati and Egyptian officials, gave details about the country’s security agencies at a time when press freedoms in Egypt are shrinking.</p>
      <p>A journalist from Mada Masr speaking from outside the news site’s building told AFP on Sunday that police officers were still inside.</p>
      <p>He described seeing several vehicles belonging to security forces and was met by plainclothes police officers at the entrance of the building.</p>
      <p>“They initially prevented me from entering then they took me up to the sixth floor, where the office is. We knocked on the door and I saw my colleagues for a fraction of a second,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A policeman, also plainclothed, said we don’t want anyone coming or going and I was let go,” he added.</p>
      <p>The journalist said he would be returning with a lawyer later.</p>
      <p>Egypt jails more journalists than any other country behind China and Turkey, according to New York-based watchdog Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
      <p>Mada Masr is one of hundreds of websites blocked by Egyptian authorities in recent years and can only be accessed domestically via a virtual private network (VPN) application.</p>
