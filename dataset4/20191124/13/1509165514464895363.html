      <p>GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nov 24 (Reuters) - At least 24 people were killed, including some on the ground, when a small plane crashed into a densely populated neighbourhood in the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday, a local lawmaker and a rescue worker said.</p>
      <p>The aircraft, which was operated by local company Busy Bee, crashed shortly after take-off en route to the city of Beni, about 250 km (155 miles) to the north, North Kivu Governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita's office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The company said the 19-seater Dornier 228-200 had 16 passengers and two crew members on board.</p>
      <p>There was no word yet on what might have caused the accident.</p>
      <p>Jean Paul Lumbulumbu, the vice president of North Kivu's parliament, said 24 bodies had been recovered from the rubble, including those of several people hit by falling debris. A rescue worker, who asked not to be named, said 26 bodies had been recovered.</p>
      <p>At the crash site in Goma's Mapendo neighbourhood, residents threw water from buckets and cooking pots onto the smouldering wreckage. The rear section of the plane rested sideways, propped up by a wall, videos posted on social media showed.</p>
      <p>A Reuters witness at the scene said two people - one who was on board the plane and a child in a building hit by the wreckage - were rescued before the plane exploded into flames after crashing.</p>
      <p>Police arrested one man for stealing cash from the rubble and fired warning shots to disperse people who had started looting, he said.</p>
      <p>Air accidents are relatively frequent in Congo because of lax safety standards and poor maintenance. All Congolese commercial carriers, including Busy Bee, are banned from operating in the European Union.</p>
