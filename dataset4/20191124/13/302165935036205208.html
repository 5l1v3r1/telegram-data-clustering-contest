      <p>ROQUEBRUNE-SUR-ARGENS (France), Nov 24 — Two people were found dead on Sunday after massive flooding that has hit southeastern France since Friday, causing major damage in the region, local authorities said.</p>
      <p>One person was found dead near Muy, between the towns of Nice and Marseille, the police prefecture of the Var department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The statement did not say whether that was the person it had earlier reported as missing after falling off a rescue boat near Muy late yesterday.</p>
      <p>Another body was found in a car in Cabasse, a village nearby, it added.</p>
      <p>In its earlier statement, the prefecture said a 77-year old man was also missing since Saturday morning in Saint-Antonin-du-Var.</p>
      <p>Several rivers burst their banks in southeastern France, causing major damage as homes were flooded and trees, cars and boats were swept along by the waters.</p>
      <p>Rainfall continued in the region on Sunday, but was less intense. Floods were expected to subside during the day, Meteo France said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Christophe Castaner was due to travel to the Var later on Sunday to meet victims and rescue workers. — Reuters</p>
