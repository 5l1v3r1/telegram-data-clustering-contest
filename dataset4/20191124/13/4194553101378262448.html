      <h1>Ugurcan Cakir admits LFC transfer links have given him a confidence boost</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:03:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Trabzonspor goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir is has been linked with a move to Liverpool – most recently by Gunes, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/euro-paper-talk-liverpool-jump-to-front-of-queue-for-e30m-stopper-mega-messi-offer-from-barca">as per TEAMtalk</a>, who suggest Jurgen Klopp is eyeing him up for the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Cakir is only 23-years-old and would be seen as Alisson’s long-term deputy after a hastily-arranged move for veteran Adrian over the summer, and a bid of around £27million is believed to be enough to get the deal over the line, as per the same report.</p>
      <p>Asked about the reported interest from Liverpool, as <a href="https://www.star.com.tr/spor/">covered by Turkish newspaper Star</a>, Cakir said these links are giving him confidence.</p>
      <p>“<b>This situation gives me a lot of confidence but to be honest, I’m not paying too much attention to that. I believe this increased confidence can be seen in my game,” </b><a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/good-thing-player-discusses-linked-transfer-liverpool/">he’s quoted as saying by Sport Witness</a>.</p>
      <p>“<b>To be linked with a move to Liverpool is a good thing but I am totally focused on Trabzonspor’s success this season.</b>”</p>
      <p>The young Turk made his debut in September 2017 and stepped-up his involvement the following season. He has now been able to nail-down the no.1 spot for the Europa League outfit.</p>
      <p>He has made 41 appearances for the club and kept nine clean sheets in all, and if the report is to be believed then the Reds may call upon former striker Daniel Sturridge to convince Cakir to sign for us.</p>
