      <p>“I’ve always dreamed of talking to footballers, but no one ever replies to me. The only way I can talk to them is through my girlfriend’s phone on the DMs,” he said on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got Brandon Williams today who is actually sick and got his debut, congratulations Brandon. Little eye emoji, yes boy. Love that, classic stuff.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got Patrice Evra on there who’s like a hero of mine and who I absolutely love. He’s sent one of those things where he says ‘I love this game’. Why don’t they reply to me, but slide into her DMs? I’m just as good.</p>

      <p>“It’s always Man Utd, but where are the Chelsea boys? Mason Mount, slide in. Or Tammy Abraham, your my hero, come on.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t a great look for United’s left-backs past and present, with Evra notably married since 2007.</p>
