      <h3>What is Rule 12, used by Centre to revoke President’s Rule in Maharashtra</h3>
      <p>To revoke President’s Rule, the government has used a special Section in the Union government’s Transaction of Business Rules, which allows for revocation of President’s Rule without Cabinet approval if the Prime Minister “deems it necessary”. Rule 12 of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, allows the Prime Minister to depart from laid down norms at his discretion. Titled “Departure from Rules”, Rule 12 says, “The Prime Minister may, in case or classes of cases permit or condone a departure from these rules, to the extent he deems necessary.” <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/reliance-communications-lenders-reject-resignation-of-anil-ambani-four-other-directors-6134634/"><b>READ MORE</b></a></p>
      <h3>‘Don’t care what India think’: Pakistan hits back at doubts over Naseem Shah’s age</h3>
      <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has hit back at suggestions from some quarters that young pace sensation Naseem Shah is more than 16, his official age. Shah made his debut for Pakistan in the Brisbane Test this week. Although Pakistan lost the match on Sunday, Naseem Shah stole headlines and hearts with his searing pace – consistently clocking speeds in the mid-140s (kph) – and because of the fact that he was playing for his country days after having lost his mother. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/naseem-shah-real-age-controversy-pakistan-india-6134769/"><b>READ MORE</b></a></p>
      <h3>Craving for something sweet but healthy? Here’s why you should grab Punjabi pinni</h3>
      <p>If you are one of those looking for a nutritious yet healthy dessert that not tickles your tastebuds but also has less fat content, look no further than Punjabi pinnis — small round laddoos made of atta, nuts and oodles of ghee. Pinnis, which have a nutty taste and a light, crumbly texture, are a perfect snack during winters as they keep the body warm and increase the body’s immunity against diseases. Pinni is, however, just a general term in Punjabi for desserts or sweets prepared in a round shape. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/sweet-healthy-dessert-punjabi-pinni-immunity-pregnancy-atta-flaxseed-6134746/"><b>READ MORE</b></a></p>
