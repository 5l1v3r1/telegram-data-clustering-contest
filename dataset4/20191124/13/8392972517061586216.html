      <h1>I'm A Celebrity camp 'on lockdown' as police hunt for 'killer loose in the area'</h1>
      <h2>Body discovered less than an hour away from camp</h2>

      <p>Security for the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> camp is said to have been tightened following reports a killer is on the loose in the area surrounding the ITV reality show’s jungle base.</p>
      <p>Aussie police in New South Wales have launched an investigation into the suspicious death of man thought to be in his 50s after a body was found in Jack Evans Boat Harbour park earlier this week.</p>
      <p>According to a tabloid report, the park is close to the border between Queensland and New South Wales - less than an hour away from where I’m A Celebrity is filmed.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cullen told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-22/tweed-heads-body-found-in-sleeping-bag/11730258">local press</a> the body was found with "physical wounds".</p>

      <p>"The movements and the history of the victim is something that we are in the early stages of establishing," he said.</p>
      <p>A local resident indicated to reporters the area was well known for its growing homeless population.</p>
      <aside>Our security measures are incredibly tight.</aside>
      <p>They said: "There's always violence here, and it's often around drugs and alcohol, so they're constantly fighting each other most of the time."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> claims producers have ensured security for the show is "impenetrable" following additional checks said to be prompted by the nearby manhunt.</p>

      <p>And the newspaper also reckons the series’ celebs will be knocked for six knowing about the incident when their time on the show has come to an end.</p>
      <p>An unnamed source is quoted as telling <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>: "The celebs are being watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a team of staff and our security measures are incredibly tight.</p>
      <p>"So there is zero chance of anyone sneaking into camp.</p>
      <p>"But of course it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime."</p>
      <p>A representative for the show declined to comment on the claims when approached by ED.</p>
