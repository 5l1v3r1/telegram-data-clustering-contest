      <h2>Datapraxis analysed 270,000 polling responses to YouGov and drilled down to local data to produce the first report of its kind so far in the general election 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:46:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>The Tories could win a 48-seat majority, the first poll projection of its kind in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> has claimed.</p>
      <p>The analysis by public opinion firm Datapraxis projects Boris Johnson's party to win 349 seats - a gain of more than 30.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> is projected to lose just over 30 seats and end up on 213, with 49 seats for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> and 14 for the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>The analysis - which modelled 269,838 polling responses - also claims seven senior Tories including the Prime Minister could be at risk of losing their seats.</p>
      <p>According to data provided to the Sunday Times, the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> , Foreign Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dominic-raab-mp">Dominic Raab</a> , former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and leading Brexiteer Steve Baker could all be ousted by tactical voting campaigns.</p>
      <p>Zac Goldsmith, the former London mayoral leadership hopeful, is almost certain to lose his seat for the second time in as many years if the polling in his Richmond Park seat is correct.</p>

      <p>The environment minister trails Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem candidate who defeated him in a by-election in 2016, by 20 points.</p>
      <p>Outspoken backbencher Philip Davies and one-time leadership hopeful Sir John Redwood are both also said to be at risk.</p>
      <p>The model that was used is known as MRP and anlayses the specific demographics of each seat.</p>
      <p>It is the largest analysis of polling data completed since the December 12 election was called.</p>
      <p>The report says: "In the seven 'big beast' seats, Goldsmith seems almost certain to lose already and Raab and Duncan Smith look to be in very serious jeopardy.</p>
      <p>"Baker, Redwood, Davies and Johnson have somewhat larger leads.</p>
      <p>"But even if there is no tightening in the national polls, they could still lose through large-scale tactical campaigning and voting."</p>
      <p>The predictive model incorporated data from 270,000 interviews conducted by polling company YouGov.</p>
      <p>A YouGov poll published earlier on Saturday showed the Conservatives' vote share at 42%, 12 points ahead of Labour.</p>
      <p>Labour have repeatedly refused to comment on polls - many of which turned out drastically wrong in the 2017 election.</p>
