      <h1>NFL schedule Week 12: What games are on today? TV channels, times, scores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:20:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The Week 12 NFL schedule is as uneven as possible, with just two afternoon games.</p>
      <p>But this deep in the season, we're squarely in the flex portion of the schedule, so more of the biggest games will get top billing.</p>
      <p>In Week 12, that means the Cowboys and Patriots squaring off in a battle of Super Bowl hopefuls, and the Jaguars and Titans looking to remain in striking distance in the AFC South. The Sunday night game is a highly anticipated matchup between the 49ers and Packers.</p>
      <p>That leaves the morning slate quite barren. None of the nine early games are between teams above .500. The combined record of the 18 teams is 72-107-1, an ugly .403 winning percentage. In that small pond, the Seahawks facing the Eagles is likely the standout game.</p>

      <h3>How to watch, live stream NFL games</h3>
      <p>Week 12 kicked off Thursday night with an AFC tilt between the Colts and Texans, which Houston narrowly won after a <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colts-texans-deshaun-watson-fumble-no-review/kg12jrpvaxm5142f9qk16eah9">controversial finish</a>.</p>
      <p>Sunday's slate begins with an absurd nine 1 p.m. games. None are especially appealing, but the Eagles hosting the Seahawks is one of a few that don't include a team below .500. Despite being on the road, Seattle will still be the favorites.</p>
      <p>Both late afternoon games are compelling, with the Cowboys visiting the Patriots and the Jaguars and Titans battling for position in the tight AFC South.</p>
      <p>The remaining two primetime games of the week will beginSunday night with the Packers going on the road to take on the 49ers, and on Monday night, the Rams host Lamar Jackson and the Ravens.</p>
