      <h1>Seahawks vs. Eagles odds, prediction, betting trends for Week 12 matchup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:24:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author">Vinnie Iyer</a></address>
      <p>The Seahawks (8-2) will be trying to strengthen their NFC playoff position when they travel east to face the Eagles (5-5) on Sunday (1 p.m. ET, Fox).</p>
      <p>While Seattle, the current No. 5 seed, could end up in first place ahead of San Francisco in the NFC West after <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-12-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/gxmnxkzzjcap1ay36iwj8ukpw">Week 12</a>, Philadelphia is hoping to stay within striking distance of Dallas in the NFC East.</p>
      <p>Pete Carroll's Seahawks had a bye in Week 11 after beating the 49ers in overtime on Monday night in Week 10. That eases some of the concern of flying cross-country to play another bunch of birds. Doug Pederson's Eagles couldn't muster enough offense in a home loss to the Patriots and have seen the injuries continue to mount.</p>

      <h3>Seahawks vs. Eagles odds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spread:</b> Eagles by 1.5</li>
        <li><b>Point total:</b> 48</li>
        <li><b>Odds:</b> <a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Seahawks -105, Eagles -105</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Seahawks opened as underdogs despite being idle last week. They are undefeated on the road this season (5-0) as their two losses have come at home to two very good teams, the Ravens and Saints. The Eagles (3-2), before losing to the Patriots, also had lost to the Lions at home.</p>
      <h3>Seahawks vs. Eagles all-time series</h3>
      <p>The Seahawks lead the series 9-7. They have won four straight to take control of the NFC avian rivalry, along with six of the past seven. They won by 11 and 14 points, respectively, in games played in Seattle in '16 and '17. They won in Philadelphia in December of '14.</p>
      <h3>Three trends to know</h3>
      <p>— 66 percent of spread bettors are going with the Seahawks to cover as slight underdogs. 99 percent of moneyline bettors love the Seahawks straight up.</p>
      <p>— With Russell Wilson and Carson Wentz on the field, despite two improving defenses, 55 percent of bettors like the game to go over the above-average point total.</p>
      <p>— The Eagles are 0-2against the Seahawks over the past three seasons, failing to cover in both games. The Seahawks have either won or pushed in four straight games.</p>
      <h3>Three things to watch</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Wilson vs. the blitz</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Eagles have needed to generate pressure in creative ways with their front four struggling to rush the quarterback by itself. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz can be relentless in sending linebackers and secondary players, but Wilson has been sharp at reading blitzes and can quickly find favorable one-on-ones downfield or make teams pay by taking off and running. He's expected to have Tyler Lockett healthy at wideout, flanked by impressive rookie DK Metcalf and Josh Gordon, who should be more involved in his second game with the team after the bye. The Eagles' cornerbacks aren't good enough against receivers of that caliber to give Schwartz the luxury.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wentz and his two tight ends</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Eagles can't seem to keep their wideouts healthy and effective enough to get downfield well for Wentz. So they've relied more on tight ends Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert, both to stretch the field more and finish drives in the red zone. The Seahawks were having all sorts of troubles covering the position early in the season, prompting the pickup of former Lions safety Quandre Diggs. Diggs, however, can't help cover both Ertz and Goedert. This is the matchup Philadelphia needs to exploit most so Wentz can keep up with Wilson.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Maybe Jadeveon Clowney vs. no Lane Johnson</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Seahawks' defensive end, acquired from the Texans right before the season,is coming off his best game with the team, with a sack, five tackles, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery that he returned for a touchdown against the 49ers. He's a game-time decision with his hip injury for the game. Should he go, Clowney lines up on the left and will get to go after rookie first-round pick Andre Dillard, filling in at right tackle for the concussed Johnson. That matchup wouldn't be great news for Wentz.</p>
      <h3>Stat that matters</h3>
      <p>Wilson has been outstanding last season, but he's been more efficient on the road with a 74.7 completion percentage and 116.2 rating in five games. He threw his first interception away from Seattle in Week 10 in San Francisco. In three 1 p.m. ET starts this season, Wilson hascompleted 75.0 percent of his passes with a 127.9 rating.</p>
      <h3>Seahawks vs. Eagles prediction</h3>
      <p>The Seahawks will be well prepared and are built to attack the Eagles' weaknesses both defensively and offensively. Both teams will have limited success running the ball, so it comes down to which quarterbackwill be better positioned to make consistent plays with his arm and legs. Desperation will kick in for Philadelphia to play well both for Wentz and vs. Wilson, but the latter QB is the one to trust on the road in a close game.</p>
