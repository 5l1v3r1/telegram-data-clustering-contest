      <h1>'Too many times' - Bournemouth fans have questions after defeat to Wolves</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers latest | Wolves' 2-1 triumph at the Vitality Stadium lifted them up to fifth - but what did Bournemouth's supporters make of their side's performance?</h2>

      <p>Bournemouth are the eighth side in a row to fail to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers in a Premier League game - as Nuno Espirito Santo's side continue their impressive upward trajectory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have not lost a League game since September 14, and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-news-nuno-moutinho-adama-17306666">Saturday's 2-1 triumph</a> over the Cherries was the fourth in their last seven outings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/admire-him-former-liverpool-man-17307521">Joao Moutinho</a> and Raul Jimenez got the first-half goals to put Nuno's men in control, with Simon Francis' red card - on his first League start in 11 months - aiding the visitors' cause.</p>
      <p>Steve Cook's header ensured some nerves towards the end of the game, but Wolves saw the contest out to move up to fifth in the table.</p>

      <p>Bournemouth, meanwhile, now sit 11th in an increasingly congested mid-table.</p>
      <p>Cherries fans took to social media after the game to give their thoughts on the result and Eddie Howe's team selection...</p>
      <p><b>Kangaroo Snabitz:</b> Why couldn’t we have that effort in the 1st half? Danjuma deserves to start.</p>
      <p><b>Graham Mann:</b> If we can play like that second half, why not the first?? Too many times we see this and it costs us game</p>
      <p><b>Martin Coombes:</b> Please don't ever play 3 at the back again</p>
      <p><b>JT:</b> I dont care who gets dropped out of H.Wilson or Fraser, all I know is danjuma better start against spurs</p>
      <p><b>@Rik_J_W</b> : Eddie Howe has some questions to answer about the first half line up</p>
      <p><b>Ness:</b> Great effort!!!</p>
      <p><b>@bryanstephen5:</b> Francis is the reason why we lost.</p>
