      <p>Photographer Pat Healy was taken to hospital in Blanchardstown today following an incident with a horse after the first race in Navan.</p>
      <p>The horse (the runner -up)  jumped the rails close to the winning post after completing the circuit in the 19-runner field in the opening maiden hurdle.</p>
      <p>Mr Healy received attention from the medical personnel on duty at the track and was then taken to hospital in Blanchardstown.</p>
      <p>Today is the Troytown Chase Day at Navan and that race is scheduled to go to post at 2.30pm.</p>
      <p>The Meath Chronicle photographer at the track today is Gerry Shanahan and he commented:</p>
      <p>"We (other photographers) were on the way back to the enclosure from the final hurdle after all the horses passed us, the horse seemed to jump through the rails at the winning post where Pat Healy was standing.</p>
      <p>"He received attention quickly and was brought to hospital in Blanchardstown," added the Meath Chronicle photographer.</p>
