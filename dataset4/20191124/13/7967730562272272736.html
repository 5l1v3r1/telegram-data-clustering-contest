      <p>Picking up litter used to be considered a chore but for the Wong family, of Clifton Hill, it’s a treasured weekend hobby.</p>
      <p>You can make up stories about some pieces you find.</p>

      <p>Canoeing near the banks of the Maribyrnong River at Footscray during a litter blitz on Sunday, Ian Wong found a bunch of discarded parking fines.</p>
      <p>He wondered if the recipient had flung them away in a fit of rage or denial.</p>
      <p>His daughter, Amelia, 9, found a teddy bear at a previous blitz on the Yarra River.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the family’s booty consisted mostly of soft-drink cans, plastic bottles and the odd table-tennis ball.</p>
      <p>But at a sunny 23 degrees, it was a fabulous day to be out on the water.<br/>And there was satisfaction in saving the world.</p>
      <p>"I like how we can help clean up the river," said Amelia. "So all the animals, and we, can be healthier.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I’m actually helping the environment by doing it."</p>

      <p>Melbourne Water and the Yarra Riverkeeper Association have organised six volunteer litter blitzes on the Yarra and Maribyrnong rivers since April 2018.</p>
      <p>Previous items found have included more than 70 bicycles from the failed O-Bikes hire scheme, a life-sized anatomy skull, a porcelain toilet and a mannequin’s arm.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, a parking sign and a chair frame were among 77 kilograms of litter that 120 volunteers picked out, although the chair frame had so many living crustaceans and plants on it that it was returned to the deep.</p>
      <p>The Wongs' litter-picking tradition started three years ago when Mr Wong’s son, Alexander, attended a kindergarten near the Yarra River at Abbotsford and was taught how to respect the river and keep it clean.</p>
      <p>Mr Wong, seeking a break from a high-flying job with IBM, got talking to Yarra Riverkeeper Andrew Kelly about volunteering.</p>
      <p>Mr Wong is now on the Yarra Riverkeeper Association board and the family of four relishes the litter blitz days, seeing canoeing as fun, although Alexander, now aged six, was keenest on the sausage sizzle afterwards.</p>
      <p>Mr Wong's wife, Gillian, said it was better than the kids playing on their iPads.</p>
      <p>"There’s lots of fear among kids, I think, about the Earth, so it gives them a sense of something real they can do; it’s tangible and they can see the immediate benefit and they can talk about it with their friends," she said.</p>
      <p>Yarra Riverkeeper Andrew Kelly said Sunday’s volunteer day followed a week of paid staff from the company, Cleanwater Group, using a vacuum to clean up rubbish in reeds and rock walls along the Maribyrnong and Yarra.</p>
      <p>Mr Kelly would like to see a permanent paid crew doing this on the rivers.</p>
      <p>He would also like to see three or four volunteer days a year, on both the Yarra and the Maribyrnong, but they cost $5000 a day to run.</p>
      <p>The best advice Mr Kelly has about how to keep the rivers clean is "don’t drop litter".</p>
      <p>Microplastics, such as from bits of plastic bags or polystyrene cups, can poison and choke animals and get into human bodies.</p>
      <p>"I think we are getting better," Mr Kelly said. "But we need to get a whole lot better if Melbourne’s population is growing to 8 million in 2050."</p>
