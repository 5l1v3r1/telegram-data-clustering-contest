      <p>Ryan Lowe believes his insistence on Plymouth Argyle sticking to his Plan A for playing football is starting to pay off.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> have lost only one of their last eight League Two games – the 4-0 Devon Derby drubbing by Exeter City last month.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s 2-1 victory over high-flying Bradford City at Home Park on Saturday was their fourth win out of the last five.</p>
      <p>Lowe, appointed as their manager in the summer, has seen his side begin to play with more consistency over recent weeks.</p>
      <p>There is also a better understanding from the players about what he wants and from them and the win against Bradford highlighted that.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It gradually takes time. We have had discussions with the lads and we have shown them video clips of what we have been good at and how we have done it.</p>
      <p>“But the football takes care of itself. We put the sessions on for the lads to play that way, and as you have seen, every single one of them – man to man – was excellent in it.</p>
      <p>“I think there was a move on the 17th minute when we nearly scored and I was like ‘Wow, that would have been some goal’.</p>
      <p>“Look, that’s my style of play. That’s what I want from my boys and they are taking on board everything we ask for.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t always come off because you have got opposition that are trying to stop you but when we are in full flow like that we look a good team.”</p>
      <p>Argyle led 2-0 at half-time against Bradford, whose boss Gary Bowyer made a double substitution and switched from a 4-3-3 system to 3-5-2.</p>
      <p>Initially, that posed some problems for the Pilgrims, whose lead was cut by a Niall Canavan own goal in the 51st minute.</p>
      <p>But Lowe was not tempted to try something different tactically and, in the end, Argyle came out on top.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “There is not many times we will change our formation. We will just keep plugging away at it.</p>
      <p>“They say ‘Do you have a Plan B?’ Well, no, just do Plan A better in some circumstances.</p>
      <p>“Gary has obviously changed and it was effective more for them, but they have played that again this season also so they can adapt to it.</p>
      <p>“Come the end of it you think ‘Well, okay, we have nullified their 4-3-3 and we have certainly nullified the 3-5-2’.”</p>
      <p>Argyle have won all three of their games since they lost heavily to Exeter at St James Park on October 26.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We are on a good run of form and we have got to continue that. There will probably be another loss somewhere along the way because you can’t win every game.</p>
      <p>“We have said the league is so inconsistent, but we are looking forward now.</p>

      <p>“We have got a free week from the league – we have got the FA Cup against Bristol Rovers – and then we will bounce into December looking very positive.</p>
      <p>“We feel if we can get through December and pick some points up along the way then we will obviously be in a different position in the league.</p>
      <p>“Come January, February, March, April – four months, come on and go and kick on. That will be our aim.”</p>
