      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Nigeria is already positioned to take advantage of technology to move the country’s development forward.</p>
      <p>The President made this known on Saturday at the graduation ceremony of Senior Executive Course 41 of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos.</p>
      <p>According to the President who was represented by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, the opportunities in technology were endless.</p>
      <p>Buhari said: “We can simply leapfrog and there is so much room for that and we don’t have to evolve through the decades again. We are already positioned to take advantage of technology to move the development further.</p>
      <p>The President also identified the agricultural sector as another sector that was being transformed by technology.</p>
      <p>“There were about 530 varieties of 37 crops developed in 2014. Cassava yields have increased by 60% in the past decades. It is clear that agriculture cannot remain at the subsistence level again as it is in many parts of the country,” he added.</p>
      <p>Buhari advised the NIPSS to graduate from a “think tank” to a “do tank”, saying it was time ideas were not only formulated but also implemented.</p>
      <p>“So, I want to urge the NIPSS that our consequent studies must be based on the need to attain some level of understanding on how to implement, on how to get things done. And once you are able to get this done, I am sure substantial difference would be made,” Buhari said.</p>
