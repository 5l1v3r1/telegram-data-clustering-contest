      <p>Govind Shetty, 50, a Bengaluru-based hotel worker, was thrown out of the Bengaluru-Nanded Express at Thimmamcherla village just before the train was to reach Guntakal at 6.30 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The victim was travelling to Mantralayam from Bengaluru. Three persons, in their early thirties, boarded the train at Hindupur and befriended Mr. Govind.</p>
      <p>At Thimmamcherla, they called him to the door, telling him that the train was approaching Guntakal. Then they snatched his purse and travelling bag, and pushed him out of the moving train.</p>
      <p>Mr. Shetty suffered minor head injuries, and has been admitted to the Guntakal Government Hospital.</p>
      <p>He is out of danger, Guntakal Government Railway Police Inspector G. Gurunath Babu told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>The GRP has alerted the Raichur and Wadi stations to look out for the youths. They are also reviewing the CCTV footage that was recorded at the Guntakal station.</p>
