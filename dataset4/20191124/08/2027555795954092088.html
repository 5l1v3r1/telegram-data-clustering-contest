      <h1>'Power staff's money invested in DHFL will be returned'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:32:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Uttar Pradesh Government on Saturday night issued an order ensuring the return of state power employees' provident fund invested in scam-hit housing fiance company DHFL.</p>
      <p>The government order issued by Principal Secretary (Power) Arvind Kumar said all legal options would be explored for the recovery of the money.</p>
      <p>Over Rs 2,600 crore of the power employees' provident fund (PF) was reportedly invested in the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), prompting the state government to order a CBI probe.</p>
      <p>The order issued on Saturday also spelled out ways and means that will be adopted for ensuring the return of the employees' money.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, employees of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) had observed a 48-hour protest against the PF scam and had sought a government guarantee for the safe return of their money.</p>
