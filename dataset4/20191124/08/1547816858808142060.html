        <b>The Bigg Boss 13 house was taken by storm after Shefali Jariwali blasted Paras Chhabra for a giving a wrong angle to her friendship with Asim Riaz!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only recently, Bigg Boss 13 contestant Shefali Jariwala’s husband <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-shefali-jariwala-s-husband-parag-tyagi-blasts-trolls-for-misjudging-her-friendship-with-asim-riaz/5dd3dea487fb571eff7e41a8">Parag Tyagi had lashed out at trolls for giving a wrong angle to her friendship with Asim Riaz</a>. Well, blame Paras Chhabra for that because, during one of the episodes, he was seen discussing Shefali and Asim with Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Mahira Sharma. The former Splitsvilla winner didn’t only question their friendship but also went onto to say assume that it doesn't look good outside the house because she is married. Paras also claims to be good friends with her husband Parag and that is why he often calls her bhabhi. Well, it turns out that Devo has recited the whole incident to Shefali Jariwala.</p>
      <p>And, now, the latest Weekend Ka Vaar episode saw the actress herself slamming Paras Chabbra for spreading rumours about her friendship with Asim Riaz and questioning her character. A visibly exasperated Shefali lashed out at Paras and that she finds it derogatory to even talk about such topic. As a justification of the same, Paras responds saying that he said out of concern because Parag is his good friend. Soon after, Devoleena jumped into the argument and said that whatever Paras said was wrong and if he had concerns, he should have talked to Shefali individually.</p>

      <p>On the contrary, Shefali has been trying to link up Asim Riaz to Himanshi Khurana. Well, an episode saw Shefali telling Asim to confess Himanshi about his feelings towards her. At first, Asim is reluctant; however, he denies having any such feelings for the Punjabi actress and singer.  (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-are-asim-riaz-and-himanshi-khurana-a-couple-shefali-jariwala-hints-at-it/5dda3a190cada251e9c311ee">Bigg Boss 13: Are Asim Riaz And Himanshi Khurana A Couple?
