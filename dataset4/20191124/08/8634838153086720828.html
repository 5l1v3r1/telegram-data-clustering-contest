        <b>President Uhuru Kenyatta's mother Mama Ngina has been dragged into another fierce battle pitting an elderly mother against her children.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report by <i>Daily Nation,</i> the court battle involves a multi-million parcel of land in Gatundu Constituency in which the children claim that their mother sold to the former first lady without following the correct procedure.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, Dickson Muiruri Njoroge and his sister Esther Nyokabi further argued that they met with Mama Ngina and turned down her offer but their mother, Virginia Wairimu Njoroge, went ahead to sell the plot a few months later.</p>
      <p>Muiruri further added that he was invited for a meeting by the former first lady, together with his mother, between 2017 and 2018 but did not arrive at a conclusive agreement.</p>

      <p>“After the meeting, and without my knowledge, my mother transferred the property to her name without going through the due succession process,” read the court papers in part.</p>
      <p>The property in question is located next to the Kenyatta's home in Ichaweri near Gatundu town in Kiambu County.</p>
      <p>Nyokabi, on her part, claimed that their family depended on the property for livelihood and their mother only held the family property in the trust.</p>
      <p>“The company (Southbrook Holdings) has already threatened to evict us from the suit property, where we have been residing since the demise of our father.</p>
      <p>“We have been collecting rent from the said property which we use for our sustenance. We run the risk of being rendered destitute," she argued.</p>
      <p>In the suit, Southbrook Holdings was named as the respondent on claims that it paid Ksh20 million for the property. Mama Ngina or the larger Kenyatta family has not responded to the suit.</p>
