      <h3>Luis Suarez says Liverpool FC have a “nice advantage” in the Premier League title race.</h3>
      <p>Liverpool FC have made a promising start to the Premier League season following victories over Arsenal, Chelsea FC, Leicester, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s squad has the experience of winning top silverware after the Reds were 2-0 winners against Spurs in the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>Suarez was part of the Liverpool FC team that came to within three games of winning the Premier League title in 2013-14 before their collapse against Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The Uruguay international and his Reds team-mates at the time finish in second place and four points adrift of eventual champions Manchester City despite playing some entertaining football.</p>
      <p>Suarez moved to FC Barcelona in 2014 in what was the beginning of the end under Brendan Rodgers before Jurgen Klopp was appointed as the Northern Irishman’s replacement in October 2015.</p>
      <p>Former Reds striker Suarez believes Liverpool FC are in a good position but warned Klopp’s players not to get complacent.</p>
      <p>“[Winning the Premier League] is difficult because the season is very long,” Suarez told <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/3995508/barcelonas-luis-suarez-mls-transfer-a-nice-possibility">ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>“But they have a nice advantage at the moment and with this current Liverpool side, it’s complicated [to imagine] them letting that slip. But we all know how football is.</p>
      <p>“They had a similar advantage at one stage last season and, in the end, Manchester City won the league.</p>
      <p>“We were close to winning the league at Liverpool with young players. ‘We almost managed it without the budget they have today.</p>
      <p>“Given everything Liverpool are now, to have won it then would have had more merit.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have finished in second place in the Premier League title race on four different occasions in 2002, 2009, 2014 and 2018.</p>
