      <h2>Leeds United take on Reading this week in the Championship.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:45:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United are up to second in the Championship after securing a 2-1 win over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road this afternoon. The Whites worked hard for the win in what was a tough game against an impressive looking Hatters team. </p>
      <p>For Luton, it was an improvement on their previous Championship outing, when they were thrashed 3-0 by Reading. The Berkshire club just so happens to be Leeds’ next opponents in the Championship on Tuesday night and one of their players is already looking forward to the game. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/18056602.reading-fc-centre-back-michael-morrison-remains-upbeat-despite-narrow-defeat/">Speaking to the Reading Chronicle, </a>centre-back Michael Morrison made it clear the side were aware of the challenge Leeds will pose, after their 1-0 loss to Brentford this weekend. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“Every game is difficult but every game is winnable. You need to turn up and be ready to go every game, whether it is in three days’ time or seven days’ time.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“When you lose it is nice to play again on the Tuesday and get going.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reading had been on an improved run following a change of manager but Brentford, who are increasingly looking like outside promotion candidates brought that run to an end. </p>
      <p>Leeds, on the other hand, are on a three-game win streak and will be confident of stretching that run of form at the weekend. </p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s men will undoubtedly pose a bigger threat and be hoping to gain maximum points when the two clubs face at the weekend.</p>
