      <p>Bolivia's Congress approved a bill Saturday that opens the door to new elections without ex-president Evo Morales, as the caretaker government met with protesters to end weeks of unrest that has left dozens dead.</p>
      <p>Both houses voted in favor of the proposal that will be sent to interim President Jeanine Anez, who is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>
