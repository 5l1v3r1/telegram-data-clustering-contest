      <p>With an all-star cast, this weekend’s "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live">Saturday Night Live</a>" reenacted some of the more cringeworthy moments of last week’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential-debate">Democratic presidential debate</a> in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>“America, I see you. And I see the faces you make when I talk – you’re scared,” Woody Harrelson, flashing a mouth full of pearly whites as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>, said. “Scared I’ll say something off-color, or even worse, on color."</p>
      <p>“What I want you to know is you should be scared,” he continued.” Because I’m always one second away from calling <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a> 'Barack.'”</p>
      <p>Cast member Kate McKinnon’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> claimed she has ‘mom-hosting-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> energy.”</p>

      <p>“I’m a little overwhelmed because I thought 10 people were coming and now there’s 30 million,” she quipped. “But I promise dinner will be ready if you just get out of the kitchen and stop asking questions,” she said, mocking Warren’s dodging how she plans to pay for her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-middle-class-tax">$52 trillion Medicare-for-All plan</a>.</p>

      <p>McKinnon then jabbed at Warren’s dubious claims of Native American heritage.</p>
      <p>“And, of course, this Thanksgiving, I’ll be cooking ... the food of my ancestors. Should I say it? I’m going to say it. Maize.”</p>

      <p>Larry David as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> addressed the candidate’s recent heart attack scare.</p>
      <p>“Doctors were surprised I made it,” he said. “And I’m very proud of the fact that I was the first heart attack patient to show up to the emergency room in a city bus.”</p>
      <p>Host Will Ferrell played unblinking climate activist billionaire <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-steyer">Tom Steyer</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m running for president for a simple reason,” Ferrell said, still not blinking. “It’s fun and it gets me out of the house.”</p>

      <p>“Health care is important," Ferrell continued. "But housing affects everything: where you sleep, where you shop, where you get your shoes shined, where you buy jewels, where you raise peacocks. Am I relatable?”</p>
      <p>“Did somebody say, 'billionaire?'” Fred Armisen as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> said, crashing the debate stage while sipping a Big Gulp. “Is there time for me to come in late and ruin everything?”</p>
      <p>U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tulsi-gabbard">Tulsi Gabbard</a> (Cecily Strong) was introduced as “tonight’s villain,” saying “I want you to know I’m wearing the white suit of your fallen hero: Hillary Clinton.”</p>
      <p>Colin Jost as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> said in his closing statement, “America, I know I can do this because my supporters are a diverse coalition of young to old, gay to straight, white to eggshell.”</p>

      <p>Biden closed by saying he knows that neither Vladimir Putin nor American voters want him as the Democrats' nominee, "but I’m positive I can win the election in 2016."</p>
