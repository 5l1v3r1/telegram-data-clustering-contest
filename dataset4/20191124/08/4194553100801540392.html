      <h1>Palace face competition from Villa, Leeds &amp; Swansea for LFC’s Rhian Brewster – report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:28:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Young Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster is subject to interest from Premier League club Crystal Palace, but the Londoners will have to fend off Aston Villa, Leeds United and Swansea City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-rhian-brewster-wanted-20946287">That’s according to the Mirror</a> – who claim that all four clubs are interesting in adding the England youth star to their ranks on a temporary basis.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Brewster could be on the move as early as January, but isn’t clear on whether Jurgen Klopp is interested in shipping him out or not.</p>
      <p>With the Reds opting against strengthening in a big way over the summer, and effectively losing Daniel Sturridge, I’m not sold on the idea that the boss will happily move Brewster on.</p>
      <p>An injury to Bobby Firmino or Divock Origi, and Liverpool are in an unenviable position. That is – if we don’t sign anyone in the summer.</p>
      <p>Recently, Leipzig forward Timo Werner has been strongly linked with a move to Anfield, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/timo-werner-to-make-huge-sacrifice-and-reject-man-utd-in-favour-of-january-move-to-liverpool">including this by Bleacher Report</a>, and that could change things.</p>
      <p>If we add the German striker to the ranks at Anfield, then it becomes a tad farcical to suggest Brewster will actually get some decent playing time.</p>
      <p>Hypothetically speaking, it would take injuries to two of Bobby, Origi and Werner for the youngster to be considered – and that just wouldn’t be good for his development.</p>
      <p>This is all speculation, I should add, aside from what’s been covered in this report, there is no reason to think our No.24 is on the move just yet.</p>
