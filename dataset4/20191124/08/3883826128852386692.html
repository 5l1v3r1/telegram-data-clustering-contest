        <b>Paceman Josh Hazlewood took 4-63 as Australia thumped Pakistan in the first match of their two-Test series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tourists were bowled out for 335 in their second innings as they lost by an innings and five runs in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Australia had made 580 in response to Pakistan's first innings of 240, and the tourists resumed day four on 64-3.</p>
      <p>Babar Azam (104) and Mohammad Rizwan (95) helped Pakistan to 305-6 but they lost their last four wickets for 30 runs in only five overs.</p>
      <p>Shan Masood (42) and Iftikhar Ahmed were dismissed early on during the penultimate day before Babar and wicketkeeper Rizwan put on 132.</p>
      <p>Spinner Nathan Lyon had Babar caught behind soon after passing his century, but Rizwan and Yasir Shah (42) added 79 runs together.</p>
      <p>Hazelwood, who took six wickets in the match, had Rizwan caught five runs short of a hundred before Pakistan's collapse.</p>
      <p>Australia paceman Mitchell Starc took 3-73 in Pakistan's second innings to finish with seven wickets overall.</p>
      <p>The second Test starts in Adelaide on 29 November.</p>
