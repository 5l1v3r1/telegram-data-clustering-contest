      <h3>Jose Mourinho won’t stop Christian Eriksen leaving Tottenham Hotspur, according to a report in Italy.</h3>
      <p>Italian media outlet <i>Corriere dello Sport</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7715413/Jose-Mourinho-not-stand-way-Christian-Eriksen-departure.html">Daily Mail</a>, is reporting that the new Spurs manager won’t stand in Eriksen’s way if the Denmark international looks to secure a move in January.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Serie A champions Juventus are interested in a potential swoop to sign the creative midfielder in the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Manchester United and Real Madrid have retained an interest in the 27-year-old given that the playmaker is set to be a free agent at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to add that Eriksen will be free to speak to foreign clubs in January ahead of the expiration of his current Spurs contract in June.</p>
      <p>Eriksen moved to Tottenham in an £11m deal from Dutch side Ajax in 2013 after Spurs won the race to sign the highly-rated Denmark international.</p>
      <p>The No23 hasn’t won any silverware since his move to Tottenham but Spurs have managed to reach the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Eriksen has scored 68 times in 291 games in all competitions for Spurs over the past six seasons at the north London side.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor last week.</p>
