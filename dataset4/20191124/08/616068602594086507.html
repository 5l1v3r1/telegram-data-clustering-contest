      <p>The Vernon Vipers left this weekend with a split, starting off with a win at home on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Vipers narrowly edged the Salmon Arm Silverbacks 2-1 in a shootout. Drew Bennett had the lone regulation goal for the Vipers, and Reilly Herbst made 30 saves. Connor Marritt and Logan Cash were both successful in the shootout.</p>
      <p>Game two of their back to back homestand wasn't the same story, as they fell 3-1 to the Langley Rivermen. Connor Sleath scored for the Vipers, and Hunter Donohoe and Matt Kowalski chipped in with the assists.</p>
      <p>This weekend has Vernon locked in a tie for fourth place in the tough Interior Division with the Wentachee Wild. They are 10 points back of the Trail Smoke Eaters with three games at hand.</p>
      <p>The Vipers will be looking to bounce back on Friday when they welcome the Surrey Eagles to town, who are last place in the Mainland Division.</p>
