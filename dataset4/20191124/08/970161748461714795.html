      <p>Dan Osborne has asked <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here! viewers to go easy on his wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> after she was selected for another bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>In Saturday night’s episode Jacqueline and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> were chosen as the next pair to face a trial to collect stars for camp.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star became very upset and had to be comforted by her camp mates as she said: ‘I don’t want to do this any more’.</p>
      <p>Her husband took to Instagram and urged viewers to give her ‘a break’.</p>
      <p>Dan, who married Jacqueline in 2015, said: ‘I know I said to you all vote for Jac because she ain’t here to change light bulbs. I didn’t mean every single trial. Give her a break now. Come on.</p>

      <p>‘She keeps smashing them all. She’s worried about it but she’ll smash it. She’ll keep proving everyone . And she’s doing it with Ian Wright as well which is good. He’ll look after her.</p>
      <p>‘Let her do this one then just give her a break please. She’s getting upset now. It ain’t nice. But she’ll be good. She’ll smash it. She’ll get the stars, go back and have a nice dinner.’</p>
