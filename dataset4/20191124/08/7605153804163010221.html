        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 24 – The Kenya Meteorological Department has warned of heavy rain throughout next week, with up to 30mm raising fears of more devastating effects in various parts of the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Regions likely to be affected include Western, South Eastern, Northwestern, Northeastern and central regions including Nairobi.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The current heavy rains being experienced over several parts of the country are expected to continue on Sunday 24 November 2019 and 25 November. The rainfall intensities are expected to reduce from Wednesday over several parts of Kenya,” reads an alert from the Met department.</p>
      <p>It warned residents to be “on the lookout for potential floods, they are also advised to avoid driving through, or walking in moving water or open fields and not to shelter under trees and near grilled windows to minimize exposure to lightning strikes,” states the alert.”</p>
      <p>President Uhuru Kenyatta has already ordered authorities to relocate residents in floods and landslide-prone areas following Saturday’s tragedy in West Pokot where more than 30 people died, with many more still missing after their villages were swept off.</p>
      <p>“I have directed Regional Commissioners in flood and landslide-prone regions of our country to work very closely with our security and humanitarian teams to ensure that citizens in these areas are urgently moved to safer grounds,” President Kenyatta said in a statement from State House.</p>
      <p>In Meru National Park, three tourists and their driver were rescued after their vehicle was swept off on River Rojeweru.</p>

      <p>And in Turkana, a police vehicle was swept away by raging floods that have also cut off various bridges in the region.</p>
      <p>The Saturday tragedy in West Pokot occurred at 2.30am Saturday when houses in two remote villages were buried by the landslides following heavy rains.</p>
      <p>“We are saddened to confirm that 12 people from Tapach and Parua in Pokot South, and 17 from Tamkal in Pokot Central lost their lives,” said Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi.</p>
      <p>Already, he said, the government has deployed military and police choppers to scale up responses and respond to immediate needs of affected families while rescue and recovery efforts remain a priority.</p>
      <p>The rains have paralyzed transport in some parts of the country after rendering roads impassable and bridges swept away.</p>
      <p>The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has urged motorists to exercise caution while driving during this rainy season.</p>
      <p>According to the weatherman, the rainfall is expected to continue for the entire season with occasional breaks.</p>
