        <b>The latest political opinion poll has seen a drop in support for Fine Gael.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party dropped two points to 30% in Business Post/Red C poll – but still remains the most popular in the country.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil is unchanged at 26%.</p>
      <p>Labour has picked up a two point boost from its recent national conference in Mullingar.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin is still stuck on 11% despite holding its Ard Fheis in Derry last weekend.</p>

        <b>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is promising to bring back the Brexit bill before Christmas if his Conservative Party achieves a majority in the upcoming election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories are launching their election manifesto this afternoon.</p>
      <p>It includes promises to hold a vote on the agreement before Christmas and ensure the UK leaves the EU by the January deadline.</p>
      <p>It also pledges a “triple tax lock” which would mean no rises in income tax, national insurance or VAT.</p>

        <b>The Irish Prison Service is insisting that all practicable steps are taken by prison management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is investigating the death of a prisoner in his 30s at Cloverhill in Dublin on Friday night, after an incident involving two inmates.</p>
      <p>In a statement, it said no prison system can be completely free of violence and inter prisoner assaults do happen.</p>
      <p>Separate investigations are also underway by the Inspector of Prisons and Gardaí.</p>

        <b>There has been a huge turnout for Hong Kong elections that have taken on symbolic importance following months of protest.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A third of the city’s 4.1 million registered voters turned out in the first five hours.</p>
      <p>They are voting for council positions that are largely advisory and hold little power; however the poll is seen by many as a barometer of support for pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>Demonstrations have been scaled back in recent days – with protesters anxious to ensure the vote went ahead amid Chinese government threats to call it off.</p>

      <p><b>Pope Francis has called on world leaders scrap nuclear weapons</b>.</p>
      <p>During a visit to Nagasaki, where the second of the two US atomic bombs fell in Japan in 1945, the pontiff said the arms race decreases security and wastes resources.</p>
      <p>He said nuclear weapons threaten humanity with catastrophic destruction.</p>
      <p>He said the Nagasaki memorial stands as a stark reminder “of the pain and horror that we human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another.”</p>
