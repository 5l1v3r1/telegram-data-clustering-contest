        <b>Newcastle United are weighing up holding off on making a move for Jarrod Bowen until next summer, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/">according to a report from the Sunday Mirror (24/11; page 72)</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bowen has been a revelation in the Championship with Hull City. The 22-year-old has scored 45 league goals since the start of the 2017/18 campaign. He has nine in just 16 appearances this term, with another coming in the Carabao Cup.</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, he is attracting top flight attention. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/">The Sunday Mirror (24/11; page 72) reports</a> that Bruce wants the forward at St James’ Park having signed him for Hull back in 2014, and could make a move in January.</p>
      <p>However, the report suggests that the Magpies could decide to delay a bid until the summer. The Mirror notes that Bowen is out of contract with the Tigers at the end of the season, but they have the option to extend his deal by a further year.</p>

      <p>It is also suggested by the Mirror that the £20 million-rated star has been offered improved terms by his current club.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Are Newcastle taking a risk?</h3>
      <p>Newcastle’s potential plan seems a little risky. It is somewhat surprising that Bowen remains at Hull given his form over the last two years. And Grant McCann will be under no illusions that his current record is only going to make their task tougher in January.</p>
      <p>He may be cheaper in the summer. And it may be easier to integrate him into the plans if he joins at the end of the season. But Newcastle not acting in January may perhaps open the door for another club to make their own move for Bowen.</p>
