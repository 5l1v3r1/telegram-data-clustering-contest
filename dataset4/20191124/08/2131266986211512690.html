      <p>Australia can claim to have a settled test team for the first time in 18 months, after beating Pakistan by an innings and five runs in their series opener in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Josh Hazlewood took four wickets on Sunday at the Gabba, as Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc also chipped in to have Pakistan all out for 335.</p>
      <p>But the end didn't come as quick as the Aussies would have liked.</p>
      <p>Babar Azam hit 104, combining with Muhammad Rizwan for a 132-run sixth-wicket stand that stalled Australia's charge.</p>

      <p>But when Nathan Lyon had Babar caught behind and Muhammad upper-cut Hazlewood to third man on 95, the tail was exposed and Hazlewood capitalised.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, who would fill some of the spots in Australia's XI was still a mystery.</p>
      <p>Now the side looks set for the summer, realistically, for the first time since the ball-tampering scandal that rocked the team in March 2018.</p>
      <p>"Every time you pick, you want to be able to stick," captain Tim Paine said. "It's been hard to have stability, because we haven't been performing as well as we would have liked.</p>
      <p>"I think we have nutted out a really good group at the moment - a group that can still get a lot better as well, which is a really pleasing thing."</p>
      <p>Joe Burns locked himself in as David Warner's long-term opening partner, combining for a 222-run stand at the top, as the pair showed why they loved batting together.</p>
      <p>Warner silenced any questions over his own form, with his 154 from 296 balls in the first innings eclipsing his total runs scored and deliveries faced from the whole Ashes series.</p>
      <p>Marnus Labuschagne also looks a lock at No.3, with his maiden hundred becoming a big one of 185, as Australia cruised to 580 in their first and only innings.</p>
      <p>Australia's ability to score runs without Steve Smith firing was also crucial, given they passed 300 in an innings in which he had failed for the first time since the 2014 Boxing Day test.</p>
      <p>"The early signs would suggest, yes [we've found a top three]," Paine said.</p>
      <p>"We've known Burnsy is a quality opening batter for a long time. It was great to have him back in the side and he's got a great combination with Davey.</p>
      <p>"Marnus was given some opportunities 18 months ago, when some people thought he shouldn't have, but I think selectors saw the talent he had.</p>
      <p>Starc finished with seven wickets for the match, rushing through the tail in the first innings and claiming two early scalps to run through the Pakistan top order in the second.</p>
      <p>Amid some tough spells on Sunday, he still looked a more controlled bowler this summer, after making small tweaks to his action, while sitting out most of the Ashes.</p>
      <p>Cummins again showed potency as both an opening bowler and at first change.</p>
      <p>He grabbed the first scalp of the summer, which kickstarted a Pakistan collapse from 75/0 to 78/4 in the first innings.</p>
      <p>The quick also removed Asad Shafiq on the third evening, after the righthander had been a thorn in Australia's side in the first innings.</p>
      <p>Pakistan don't have the same luxuries, as they head to Adelaide on Friday for the second and final test.</p>
      <p>On sunday, they admitted they would rethink their batting line-up, after none of their top three passed 50 in either innings.</p>
      <p>The pressure is also on to return Muhammad Abbas to the team, after his controversial omission for the Gabba.</p>
