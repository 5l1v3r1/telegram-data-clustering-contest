      <p>Police in Harare on Saturday brutally assaulted MDC Alliance treasure general David Coltart's son and lawyer Douglas Coltart as he visited his client in holding cells. <br/><br/><br/>David confirmed the assault on his son and called on the Law Society of Zimbabwe to take up the case with Police Commissioner Godwin Matanga and Home Affairs  Minister Kazembe Kazembe. <br/><br/>"I confirm that my son Doug Coltart was brutally assaulted yesterday by police . I trust the law society of Zimbabwe will now act and take this matter up with the Minister of Home Affairs and  Commisioner of Police. The assault of lawyers whilst representing their clients is unacceptable," said David. <br/>The assault was also confirmed by activist Obert Masaraure whom Douglas had gone to visit. <br/><br/>" Thank you all so for the support @ZLHRLawyers through @bamujm secured my release. Will share full account latter. My heart bleeds for @DougColtart who was brutally assaulted when he  brought me food Lets pray for his  recovery Hats off Emma and David Drury for your legal counsel," he said.<br/><br/>Recently, Douglas was arrested and taken to court by police who accused him of obstructing the course of justice.<br/><br/>This was after he questioned the police on why they were arresting some rural teachers who had staged a peaceful demonstration outside a government building.</p>
