      <p>Emergency services raced to Church Street following the smash.</p>
      <p>The road was locked down by police as they probed the crash.</p>
      <p>The woman was taken by ambulance to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, where she is in a serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Cops are now calling on anyone who may have seen the crash to come forward.</p>
      <p>Sgt Alastair Purvis, of Glenrothes Road Policing Unit, said: “The woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries but is now in stable condition.</p>
      <p>"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the crash to come forward.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the force said: "Around 6.45pm on Saturday November 23, police were called to a road traffic collision involving a car and a pedestrian on Church Street, Glenrothes.</p>
      <p>"Emergency services attended and the road was closed.</p>
      <p>"A 49-year-old woman was taken to Ninewells Hospital with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are ongoing."</p>
      <p>It came just over an hour after <a href="http://bit.ly/2pPvsIk">cops swooped on the shopping centre</a> after reports of a <a href="http://bit.ly/2pPvsIk">man with a "knife and a firearm"</a>.</p>
      <p>Cops recovered the blade and the replica gun.</p>
      <p>A <a href="http://bit.ly/2pPvsIk">16-year-old was arrested.</a></p>
