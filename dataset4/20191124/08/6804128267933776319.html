      <h1>Michail Antonio's return is perfectly timed for lethargic and under-performing West Ham</h1>
      <h2>Here are our takeaways from West Ham's narrow loss - on the scoreboard - against Spurs</h2>

        <b>The two second half goals should not gloss over West Ham's problems</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is very reminiscent of the Newcastle match, which also ended in the same result, where West Ham were rubbish yet the scoreline looked better than the game itself showed.</p>
      <p>Angelo Ogbonna's 95th minute goal spared manager Manuel Pellegrini an almighty pasting from the home fans, which he half-received midway through the second half anyway, but it certainly could have been a lot worse.</p>
      <p>West Ham were hopeless. Spurs not much better after Harry Kane made it 3-0, Jose Mourinho admitted afterwards his players were poor after 65 minutes, but they didn't need to be any better.</p>
      <p>There are serious problems for Pellegrini, who doesn't seem to have an answer for the problems he and his team are going through as their winless run in the league stretches to seven games.</p>
      <p>Felipe Anderson is having a terrible time of it and was hauled off at the break for a second time this season. Sebastien Haller looks devoid of confidence in front of goal, Issa Diop looks skittish and jumpy, everything he wasn't last season and, well, we don't need to say anything more about Roberto in goal.</p>
      <p>The manager brought on Pablo Fornals in the second half and again played him out wide and he touched the ball three times at the most. One substitute did make an impact and that was Michail Antonio, more on him later.</p>
      <p>But, it was another wretched display and it's not just that West Ham are losing games at the moment - it is the manner in which they are losing them which is the biggest concern.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A lot relies on Michail Antonio's form to get the Hammers back to their best</b>

      <p>The winger managed 45 minutes against Spurs on Saturday and it was a purposeful and impactful half, capped with a fine finish to make the game 3-1 and give the home side a lifeline.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has been sorely missed since tearing his hamstring in late August. Judging by some of his defensive tracking runs in the second half on Saturday, he hasn't lost any of his explosiveness.</p>
      <p>Antonio is a player who plays to his strengths, literally, as he is a strong lad. He holds the ball up, bulldozes his way about with often reckless abandon but he makes a difference.</p>
      <p>He is exactly what this under-performing Hammers side need now, someone to inject some energy and pace to proceedings in what has been a very lethargic starting eleven in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>There is now danger that there is an over-reliance on Antonio, though. Anderson is dreadfully out of form, Yarmolenko likewise on the opposite flank, so the manager has to decide who is replaced.</p>
      <p>
        <b>More questions of the manager after another struggle</b>

      <p>Pellegrini has to share some of flak for West Ham's current malaise.</p>
      <p>His continued selection of Roberto since the Everton defeat has been questionable for sure, then Pablo Zabaleta starting against Newcastle, persisting with an out-of-form Anderson, benching Angelo Ogbonna for no reason only to recall him this weekend, for example.</p>
      <p>Then there is his continued use of the 4-1-4-1 formation which hasn't worked for two months and still isn't working now. Haller still looks hopeless isolated by himself, the wide men are not playing well and the amount of space Spurs' Dele Alli and Son Heung-min had between Declan Rice and the back four was alarming, to say the least.</p>
      <p>At the time, Pellegrini's substitution when he brought on Carlos Sanchez and his 14 minutes of Premier League action this season to replace the Issa Diop was strange. Looking back, maybe his is preparing for Chelsea next week as Diop is suspended and Declan Rice shifted to centre half for the final 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>Oh yes, it's Chelsea next week as well. It doesn't get any easier for the under-fire manager, the third-highest paid in the Premier League.</p>
