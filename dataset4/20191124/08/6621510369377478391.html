      <p>SIALKOT – Clearly with little else going on his life, schadenfreudian jerk Asim Maqbool, 32, wakes up at 5 am every morning for the sole purpose of watching a group of men being battered.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses confirmed around noon on Sunday that Maqbool had woken up at 5 am sharp every day from Thursday keenly observing 11 guys being beaten up by 11 other guys till early afternoon.</p>
      <p>It was further observed, onlookers confirmed, that this peculiar early morning ritual was designed based on the group being beaten not the one doing the beating.</p>
      <p>“The way he is invested in the whole thing, he feels he’s an active participant. Hence the schadenfreude actually borders on sadism,” said Maqbool’s girlfriend Hadia Mehmood, 28, currently pursuing a Masters in Philosophy at Rutgers University, New Brunswick in the US.</p>
      <p>Anthropologists confirm that Maqbool’s bizarre ritual was a regular practice in ancient times, but is rarely seen among any known tribes anymore.</p>
      <p>“Only a few scattered individuals in the region practice this ritual, which in the previous century was a form of propitiatory offering, or expiation,” Jason Kamilar, the editor of Evolutionary Anthropology magazine, told The Dependent.</p>
      <p>Investigations into the phenomenon further reveal that Maqbool won’t be waking up at 5am on Monday, with the practice set to resume on Friday – but at a less peculiar time of 8am.</p>
      <p>At press time, Maqbool had opened his laptop to schedule his digital marketing assignments for the coming week.</p>
