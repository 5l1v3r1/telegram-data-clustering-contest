      <h2>Prince Andrew is pictured grinning with his arm around the waist of Virginia Roberts, who claims she was paedophile Jeffrey Epstein's "sex slave", as Ghislaine Maxwell stands behind them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:02:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>An infamous photo showing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew</a> with his arm around Jeffrey Epstein's alleged "sex slave" is seen in full for the first time.</p>
      <p>The uncropped version shows the picture taker's thumb in the bottom right corner, but the person's identity is a mystery.</p>
      <p>The camera is said to be in the hands of paedophile Epstein as Andrew smiles with alleged child sex trafficking victim Virginia Roberts and alleged madame Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The snap is  said to have been taken in March 2001, but Andrew claims he doesn't remember it being taken or even meeting Ms Roberts - then 17 - that evening in London.</p>
      <p>He has even tried to suggest that it may have been faked.</p>

      <p>Ms Roberts, now married and known as Virginia Giuffre, alleges that the photo was taken at Ms Maxwell's mews house in Belgravia, central London after a night out at Tramp nightclub in Mayfair.</p>
      <p>She claims that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17.</p>
      <p>In a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview, the Duke, 59, denied those claims and insisted that an alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen because he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>

      <p>Andrew also bizarrely claimed a medical condition left him unable to sweat as evidence against the claim by Mrs Giuffre that he had sex with her when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre, now 36, claims Andrew was "profusely sweating" as he danced with her.</p>
      <p>But Andrew disputed the events, on the basis that he could not physically sweat at the time due to suffering a charge of adrenalin during the Falklands War.</p>
      <p>In February 2011, Mrs Giuffre told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718689/Picture-haunts-Prince-Andrew-seen-time-revealing-house-interior.html">Mail on Sunday</a> that the photo was taken at Ms Maxwell's home after a night out at Tramp.</p>

      <p>She said at the time: "All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to show my mom."</p>
      <p>She has given the original to the FBI, who were investigating claims of child sexual abuse against Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail in August while awaiting trial.</p>
      <p>There is growing pressure from Epstein’s alleged victims for the humiliated Duke to speak to the FBI which is investigating the sex scandal in the US.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who was forced to step back from royal duties following the "car crash" Newsnight interview, is facing further crisis with BBC Panorama set to air a new interview with Mrs Giuffre on December 2.</p>
      <p>Now living in Australia, the American woman has claimed she was groomed and forced to be a "sex slave" for financier Epstein and some of his friends when she was a teenager.</p>
      <p>She claims she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in a London home, at Epstein's New York mansion and at his Caribbean island.</p>
      <p>She also claims she was recruited by Ms Maxwell, the British socialite and daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxwell had dated Epstein and introduced the financier to Andrew.</p>
      <p>The Brit, 57, has denied claims she recruited, groomed and trafficked girls to be sexually abused by Epstein and others. She has not been charged with a crime.</p>
