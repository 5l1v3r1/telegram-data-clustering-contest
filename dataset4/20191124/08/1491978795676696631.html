      <p>Weather has hampered firefighting efforts as the New South Wales premier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gladys-berejiklian">Gladys Berejiklian</a>, announced $48m has been set aside for bushfire recovery, after blazes devastated some communities.</p>
      <p>The community recovery package – a joint federal and state government initiative – was announced on Sunday morning and includes grants of up to $15,000 to help small businesses and farmers.</p>
      <p>Berejiklian said it would take some time to appreciate the full financial burden of the devastating bushfires.</p>
      <p>“The impact to communities has been evident over the last few weeks, however the extent of the impact to our farming and business sectors has not been fully quantified as these bushfires continue to burn,” she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The federal emergency management minister, David Littleproud, said $18m of the $48m package had been earmarked for community projects.</p>
      <p>“When money flows around a community it can help to speed up the whole recovery,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The package will be targeted at the north coast, mid-north coast and northern tablelands.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile firefighters were on the lookout for new blazes sparked by lightning in the storms that rolled over parts of NSW on Friday and Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Rural Fire Service tweeted a warning for large storm cells between Tenterfield and Tamworth.</p>
      <p>“Although there will be pockets of heavy rain, there is not expected to be widespread falls, just a lot of lightning,” it said.</p>
      <p>Firefighters would continue to patrol the areas in coming days.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile rain in other parts of the state had hampered backburning efforts in some areas.</p>
      <p>“Easing conditions will allow firefighters to identify and strengthen containment lines as well as identify new ignitions from yesterday’s storms,” the RFS said on social media.</p>
      <p>“Rainfall across some fire grounds yesterday is making access by ground difficult to some areas today. This will limit the amount of firefighting being done by crews today.”</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning there were more than 60 fires burning across NSW.</p>
      <p>All of these were at “advice” alert level, including the 180,000 hectare (445,000 acre) Gospers Mountain blaze near Sydney’s north-western outskirts.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Elli Blandford said temperatures would be cooler around many of the state’s fire grounds on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We are looking at cooler temperatures today, particularly where we are seeing fires on the mid-north coast and out in the Hunter,” she told AAP.</p>
      <p>“In addition we’ve got onshore winds, which increase humidity and means conditions aren’t as dry in a lot of places.”</p>
      <p>The combination of increased humidity and weaker winds meant a lower fire danger rating, although this rating was forecast to increase on Monday</p>
      <p>“In the next couple of days we will see an increase in fire danger ratings,” Blandford said.</p>
      <p>“A front will move through the state, with a combined increase in temperatures and strong winds associated with that front.”</p>
      <p>Fire dangers would be elevated but were unlikely to be as extreme as those seen in the past fortnight, she added.</p>
