      <p>A last minute Emily van Egmond penalty helped W-League glamour side Melbourne City collect a fortuitous 2-1 comeback win over Canberra United at McKellar Park.</p>
      <p>The all-star City seemed set for a second successive draw to open the season before van Egmond converted one of the last kicks of the game, after Yukari Kinga had been bundled over in the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Canberra took the lead after impressive Brazilian Camila Martins Pereira crashed a shot against the frame of the goal, allowing American striker Katie Stengel to sweep home the rebound just on the hour mark.</p>

      <p>The lead lasted just eight minutes as new signing Milica Mijatovic netted her first W-League goal, with the Serbian finishing coolly after an assist from evergreen Japanese midfielder Kinga.</p>
      <p>Remarkably City fielded 10 internationals, including their three new Matildas signings in Aivi Luik, van Egmond and Ellie Carpenter, the latter two lining up against their former club.</p>
      <p>There was also a welcome return for Kyah Simon after a long injury absence, which cost the Matildas' attacker a spot in the Women's World Cup squad.</p>

      <p>The two sides proved well matched throughout the 90 minutes, despite the apparent disparity on paper.</p>
      <p>Canberra's international imports impressed, especially Camila and American attacker Simone Charley, suggesting last season's disappointing campaign will soon be a distant memory.</p>
      <p>Carpenter impressed for City, as did Steph Catley on her 50th appearance for the club, while Kinga's role in the two goals was decisive.</p>

      <p>Despite their big-name roster, Melbourne City finished fifth last season to miss the semi-finals for the first time in their four-season history.</p>
      <p>Champions Sydney FC sit top of the standings ahead of Western Sydney Wanderers on goal difference after the Sky Blues edged a 1-0 win over Adelaide United on Friday.</p>
      <p>Caitlin Foord's lone second-half goal ensured Sydney FC made it two wins from two to start the season, though they rode their luck at times against a youthful Adelaide side.</p>
      <p>In other action earlier in the round, the Wanderers saw off Newcastle Jets with a lone Amy Harrison penalty, while Melbourne Victory bounced back from an opening defeat with a 3-2 victory over Brisbane Roar.</p>
