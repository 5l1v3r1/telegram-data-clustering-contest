        <figcaption>What it's like to live in the smelliest bit of Swansea</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you're a regular or even occasional driver along Swansea's Fabian Way, there's an aroma you're bound to be familiar with.</p>
      <p>As you get towards Crymlyn Burrows, you might start winding up the windows and turning the air to recirculate.</p>
      <p>It hits you like the proverbial brick.</p>
      <p>To put it bluntly, this part of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> stinks. A smell of raw sewage hangs in the air and most are glad to drive quickly past to fresher fragrances.</p>
      <p>It's all down to the Swansea Bay Wastewater Treatment Works which sits looking out to sea to the south of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/fabian-way">Fabian Way</a> .</p>
      <p>Strong odours have been reported by people living in nearby Crymlyn Burrows for a number of years.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Welsh Water, which owns the treatment works, said: "We appreciate that the odour is very unpleasant at times but would like to reassure the community that it does not pose a danger to health and it is our priority to resolve it as quickly as we can."</p>
      <p>However, people living in the area around the treatment plant say it is still a problem, especially in the summer.</p>

      <p>When the issue was reported three years ago, seawater getting into the sewerage network was blamed for the stink, as well as a problem with the plant's gas digester, which turns excess gas from the waste into renewable energy.</p>
      <p>The same problems with the smell along Fabian Way seem to be persisting to this day though, with Welsh Water now saying it has submitted planning permission for "odour mitigation features" with <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-council-1">Swansea Council</a> .</p>

      <p>Mary Evans, 70, has lived in the same house in Elba Crescent, Crymlyn Burrows, for 50 years and said she started noticing the smell as soon as the sewage treatment plant was built.</p>
      <p>"I keep hoping they'll do something about it. We've had letters about it but nothing seems to be changing.</p>
      <p>"It's back again at the moment but it's not as bad as during the summer, then it's really awful.</p>
      <p>"I can smell it worse when I get on the bus into town, it really stinks when you're going down Fabian Way, so bad you can actually taste it sometimes."</p>
      <p>Mrs Evans said she had to keep the windows up on her car when driving past the works or the smell could become "unbearable" and she felt it was "embarrassing" to admit she lived there sometimes.</p>
      <p>People who are relatively new to the street have picked up on the whiff too.</p>

      <p>Daniel Baxter, 19, is an aerospace engineering student at Swansea University, which has a campus across the road.</p>
      <p>"I'd rather it wasn't there to be honest. It's like a blocked drains kind of smell, sometimes it's not too bad but I do notice it.</p>
      <p>"We've had letters from Welsh Water about it, saying they've had a lot of complaints," he said.</p>
      <p>Businesses close to the works also have to deal with the affects of the smell.</p>

        <figcaption>Chris Pullen says the smell is pretty 'ripe'<cite>(Image: Wales Online)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"The smell is pretty good around here and by that I mean bad. Two or three times a week we get it and it's even worse in the summer," said Chris Pullen, sales manager at Blazers Caravan Co on the opposite side of Fabian Way to the treatment plant.</p>
      <p>"When it's ripe, it's ripe, I can tell you. We have quite a few customers come in and say to us 'God, what's that smell?'"</p>
      <p>There seems to be consensus that it's at its height in the summer but it also persists through the year.</p>
      <p>Suzanne Brookes, 59, who has lived on Elba Crescent for 16 years, said: "It's like an eggy, sewer-like smell. It all depends on the weather how bad it is, but there isn't much you can do about it, you just have to put up with it and hope it's not going to last all day."</p>
      <p>Many of the residents of Elba Crescent said they had recently received letters from Welsh Water reassuring them the situation was being investigated.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Welsh Water said: "We continue to optimise and improve the performance of Swansea Bay Wastewater Treatment Works and we are planning further investments.</p>
      <p>"We have submitted a planning application to Swansea Council for permission to install new odour mitigation features at the treatment works.</p>
      <p>"If approved, we hope to begin our work at the site off Fabian Way in 2020, and will be holding a public information event when we will have more details about our proposals. We will write to local residents to let them know when this event will be held.</p>
      <p>"If our customers have any further queries regarding this work, they can contact us on 0800 085 3968."</p>
