      <h1>Glastonbury 2020: Taylor Swift tipped to headline festival as bookmakers slash odds</h1>
      <h2>Pop star could join Paul McCartney and Diana Ross on line-up for 50th anniversary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:20:47+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Parfitt</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> co-organiser <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MichaelEavis">Michael Eavis</a> has confirmed a female artist will headline the festival next summer, fuelling speculation that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> could top the bill.</p>
      <p>The pop star has been widely tipped to perform at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/glastonbury-2020">Glastonbury 2020</a>, which will mark the festival’s 50th anniversary, following the release of her new album <i>Lover</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PaulMccartney">Paul McCartney</a> has already been announced as the festival’s Saturday night headliner, while Motown icon Diana Ross will play the Sunday afternoon ‘legends’ slot.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07t4snh">BBC Somerset</a>, Eavis said one of the two remaining headliners is a woman, adding: “You would love her to bits – everybody does – but no names at the moment.”</p>
      <p>His comments have prompted bookmakers including SkyBet to offer odds of just 3/1 on Swift headlining the Pyramid Stage.</p>
      <p>Swift is due to perform at a string of European festivals next summer on her <i>Lover</i> world tour, including in France, Germany and Portugal, but has yet to announce any UK performances.</p>
      <p>Fans have noticed that the 29-year-old singer has a gap in her schedule which could allow her to travel to Glastonbury, which is taking place between June 24 and 28.</p>
      <p>Other female artists rumoured to be headlining include Madonna, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, with SkyBet offering odds of 8/1, 14/1 and 18/1 respectively.</p>
      <p>The festival has been criticised by some for a lack of female headliners in recent years, with co-organiser <a href="https://www.glastofestfeed.com/latest/news/emily-eavis-glastonbury-2020-close-50-50-gender-split/">Emily Eavis pledging to “work towards” a 50/50 gender balance</a> in future lineups.</p>
      <p>Tickets for next year’s event sold out in just 34 minutes amid huge demand, with more than 2.4 million people registering to buy them.</p>
