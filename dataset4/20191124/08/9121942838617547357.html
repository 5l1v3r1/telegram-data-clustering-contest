      <p>In its fifth season in the FBS, Charlotte is bowl eligible for the first time.</p>
      <p>The 49ers secured that prize with a 24-13 win over Marshall on Saturday. They were one of two Conference USA teams that earned their sixth victories of the season in noteworthy fashion this weekend. Florida International did so as well with a 30-24 win over Miami.</p>
      <p>Arizona State became bowl eligible with a 31-28 win over Oregon, and California did so as well by beating Stanford 24-20 in the Big Game, snapping a nine-game losing streak in that series.</p>
