      <p>Madrid - Barcelona footballer <b>Gerard Pique</b> insisted on Saturday the inaugural<b> Davis Cup Finals</b> in Madrid have been an "absolute success", although he did admit some changes would have to be made in future.</p>
      <p>The controversial week-long finals were launched by Pique's investment company Kosmos, replacing the old World Group which saw teams play each other in longer ties spread across the year.</p>
      <p>"The competition is an absolute success," Pique told broadcasters Movistar.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is that it has a soul... The players have reactions that they don't even have in the Grand Slams."</p>
      <p>There have been some issues at the Caja Magica, with low attendances for many matches, while Wednesday's group-stage tie between the United States and Italy ended at 4:04am local time.</p>
      <p>"I think this is the base and from there it will grow a lot," added Pique.</p>
      <p>"Things are going to be retouched, obviously. The issue of the schedules must be retouched. But that's what happens to events when the format is changed."</p>
      <p>Pique arrived at the Caja Magica to watch Spain's semi-final against Britain after playing in Barcelona's 2-1 win over Leganes earlier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Canada beat Russia in the other last-four match to book their place in Sunday's final.</p>
