      <h1>Jose Mourinho's earnings from being hired and fired by Premier League clubs</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur, and will take charge of his first game at West Ham on Saturday lunchtime</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>It is safe to say that the Premier League is a little bit obsessed with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss strode into <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur this week, taking over from the sacked Mauricio Pochettino and signing a three-and-a-half year deal in North London.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will took charge of his first Tottenham game on Saturday when his new side went to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in a London derby, with that match officially kicking off his fourth spell in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>And those four spells have been very, very lucrative ones.</p>
      <p>When Mourinho breezed into English football as 'The Special One' at Chelsea back in 2004, he signed a deal worth <b>£5million a year</b> as per a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/football/06/02/england.chelsea/">CNN</a> report at the time.</p>

      <p>Just over three years later he was out on his ear though, as a row with Roman Abramovich and deepening tensions at the club led to him walking out.</p>
      <p>Ten years after that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-paid-jose-mourinho-staff-9617681">the Mirror's James Whaling revealed</a> that <b>Chelsea paid out £23.1million</b> to Mourinho and his staff when they were axed from the club, eventually turning up at Inter Milan the following summer.</p>
      <p>After successes at Inter and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , Mourinho was back in England in the summer of 2013 as he started a second spell with Chelsea that was worth <b>£8.5million a year</b> according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/03/jose-mourinho-confirmed-chelsea-manager">Guardian</a> report at the time.</p>

      <p>Mourinho won the Premier League title in 2014/15, but he was off again just seven months later with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-paid-jose-mourinho-staff-9617681">Mirror</a> reporting that the Portuguese and his staff were given <b>an £8.3million</b> payoff.</p>
      <p>Manchester United were the next club to come calling for his services, and when he was appointed as the new Old Trafford boss in 2016 it was reported by <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2016/05/27/man-united-hires-mourinho-as-manager-on-3-year-deal/85023210/">USA Today</a> that he signed a <b>£12million a year</b> deal, although he was also earning more from endorsements.</p>

      <p>His United adventure ended in acrimony and a <b>£19.6m payoff</b><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-manchester-united-accounts-confirm-13998982">for him and his staff</a> in December last year, while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jose-mourinhos-salary-tottenham-former-20919811">he's now popped up at Spurs</a> on a <b>£15million a year</b> , three-and-a-half year deal.</p>
      <p>That Premier League obsession certainly has been very good to him.</p>
