      <p>DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) — With the forecast calling for substantial rain in Southern California next week, Del Mar has canceled Thanksgiving Day racing.</p>
      <p>Track officials said Saturday that they would shift several of the races from Thursday’s card, including the $100,000 Red Carpet Stakes, to expanded 10-race cards next Saturday and Sunday. There will be seven graded turf races over the two days.</p>
      <p>Also, the track plans to race Friday as scheduled but will race only on its main dirt track that day. Friday’s feature, the $200,000 Hollywood Turf Cup, will be run next Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tom Robbins, Del Mar’s executive vice president for racing, says safety comes first with horses and jockeys.</p>
      <p>Del Mar worked with the Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California Horse Racing Board to make the changes.</p>
      <p>It’s the second time Del Mar has canceled racing ahead of scheduled rain during its current fall meet. It didn’t race last Thursday when the season’s first rain fell.</p>
      <p>Although the track north of San Diego won’t race on Thanksgiving, it will be open for holiday brunch.</p>
