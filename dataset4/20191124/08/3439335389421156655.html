      <p>Tipsters helped Kauai police nab a suspect in two thefts last month at Kukui Grove Center.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old man was arrested late Friday afternoon for investigation of fourth-degree theft in connection with two incidents that occurred within an hour of each other on Oct. 25 at Longs Drugs and Times Supermarket. The man was later released on $1,000 bail for one count of fourth-degree theft. Police are continuing to investigate.</p>
      <p>Police said the man was captured on surveillance footage closely following a customer at Times about 7:30 a.m. Oct. 25 before grabbing a wallet from the victim’s bag and hastening to the exit. About a half-hour later, the same man was seen on surveillance footage entering Longs Drugs while wearing sunglasses.</p>
      <p>A customer told police the man was following her closely before grabbing her wallet from her handbag and running out the door.</p>
      <p>Kauai police were able to identify the man after posting a request on social media on Wednesday for information about the suspect. Police received several tips in response.</p>
      <p>“We wish to thank the public for their swift response and help in identifying the suspect,” Kauai Police Chief Todd Raybuck said in a statement. “We appreciate the efforts of our officers, the community, and all involved. We also continue to encourage the community to remain vigilant with your belongings, keeping a close eye on them at all times, and to be aware of any suspicious activity while shopping.”</p>
