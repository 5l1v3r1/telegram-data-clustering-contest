      <h3>The Reds’ incredible character was lauded and attributed as the driving force behind the early title charge…</h3>

      <p>The <i>Guardian’s</i> <b>Sachin Nakrani</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">wrote</a> how Liverpool’s “sheer bloody-mindedness” was the reason the Reds got over the line:</p>
      <blockquote>But it was undeniable in their sheer bloody-mindedness and refusal to give up on victory.</blockquote>
      <p>“The never-say-die spirit” instilled by Klopp shone through once again, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/crystal-palace-1-2-liverpool-player-ratings-4/">wrote</a> <i>TIA’s</i> <b>Henry Jackson</b>:</p>
      <blockquote>The Reds keep rolling on, as the never-say-die spirit Klopp has instilled in his players came through yet again.</blockquote>
      <p><i>ESPN’s</i> <b>Liam Wheeler</b> <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/liverpool-engliverpool/story/3995678/sadio-mane-on-point-with-8-10-as-liverpool-overcome-stubborn-crystal-palace">highlighted</a> Liverpool’s key strength in being able to find victory even on off-days – a characteristic of title winning sides:</p>
      <blockquote>Even when below their best, Klopp’s men always seem to find a way to win. <br/><br/>[…]<br/><br/>His side weren’t at their best, but Champions always find a way to win and the German will be pleased with his sides response to conceding.</blockquote>

      <p><b>Tony Evans</b>, writing for the <i>Independent</i>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/crystal-palace-liverpool-result-roberto-firmino-goal-report-standings-a9215196.html">explained</a> how the manner of the victory set the tone for a period which could see the Reds rely on grinding out similar style wins:</p>
      <blockquote>Over the next 40 days Liverpool play 11 games. This will be a time for grinding out results, rotating the squad and eking every last bit of energy from the squad. <br/><br/>They did not play well in south London but left with a satisfying win.</blockquote>
      <p>The <i>Mail’s</i> <b>Daniel Matthews</b> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7717849/Crystal-Palace-1-2-Liverpool-Roberto-Firminos-late-winner-saves-blushes-league-leaders.html">said</a> it is “frightening” for Liverpool’s title rivals that the Reds have dropped just two points all season despite not yet hitting top form:</p>
      <blockquote>The frightening thing for the rest of the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> is just how much more they have left to give.<br/><br/>Again here at Selhurst Park, there were gaping holes in their performance – notably in the display of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> and in a tenth straight game without a clean sheet Again, though, they left with three points, their superiority atop the table secure for now.</blockquote>
      <h3>Reporters admired how Liverpool found another late goal and assessed that the Reds love the thrill of leaving it late…</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>’s winner had the feeling of a season-defining moment, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/mane-and-bob-the-main-men-30-unbeaten-5-talking-points-from-crystal-palace-1-2-liverpool/">in the view</a> of <i>TIA’s</i> <b>Alex Malone</b>:</p>
      <blockquote>He’s been less than prolific this season, but as great players do, he popped up with an absolutely essential goal just when it’s needed.<br/><br/>It was yet another ‘if we win the league by two points, remember the moment’ kind of goal.</blockquote>
      <p>Somewhat comically, <b>Neil Jones</b> of <i>Goal.com</i>, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-ug/news/liverpools-adrenaline-junkies-are-addicted-to-winning/1w5dg8e66zfva1wgo23s9qa5zo">labelled</a> the Reds “adrenaline junkies” as Klopp’s side seem to love the thrill of chasing a late goal:</p>
      <blockquote>How many times can this team do this? How many times are they going to walk to the cliff edge, stare at what’s below and think, ‘nah, not today’? <br/><br/>They’re adrenaline junkies, plain and simple, a team forged in the image of its manager. The mundane doesn’t appeal, not when you can keep on doing things the hard way, the thrilling way.</blockquote>
      <p>The <i>BBC’s</i> <b>Alistair Magowan</b> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50443051">provided</a> a nice stat on just how valuable the late goals have been this season:</p>
      <blockquote>Late goals are becoming a trademark of Liverpool’s season and the winner should not have come as a surprise given the league leaders have claimed more points with goals after the 85th minute than any other <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> team this term.</blockquote>
      <h3>Members of the media singled out the centre-backs as the key performers on the day…</h3>

      <p><b>Jackson</b> labelled <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a>’s performance as “faultless” and explained how the Dutchman was the difference between dropping two points and taking all three:</p>
      <blockquote>This was a typically faultless performance from him, whether it be his physicality, quality in possession or leadership.<br/><br/>He won endless aerial duels, holding the back-line together – without him, Liverpool could easily have dropped points.</blockquote>
      <p>The <i>Mirror’s</i> <b>Mark Jones</b> <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/match-reports/crystal-palace-1-2-liverpool-20944501">thought</a> <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a> had a good afternoon alongside the No.4 and showed why he is deservedly first choice to partner van Dijk:</p>
      <blockquote>The Croatian has proved his worth as <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a>’s first-choice partner in recent weeks, and will take some shifting from the side.</blockquote>
      <h3>Reporters discussed how the game has left Klopp with some food for thought on several fronts…</h3>

      <p>First off, the <i>Liverpool Echo’s</i> <b>Paul Gorst</b> <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-jurgen-klopps-reds-17306740">thought</a> <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> was ineffective in attack and believes that the front three “experiment” with the No.15 should end here:</p>
      <blockquote>The Reds lacked some imagination and thrust in those areas with Oxlade-Chamberlain’s skillset better suited to bombing on from a central role. <br/><br/>[…]<br/><br/>It is perhaps an experiment that will be consigned to the dustbin going forward.</blockquote>
      <p>Finding a better balance in attack when forced to go without one of the traditional front three is something for Klopp to consider, in <b>Malone’s</b> view:</p>
      <blockquote>Whenever any one of the fabled front three are missing, there’s a noticeable drop off in the fluidity of the whole team from an attacking perspective.<br/><br/>Both Ox and Origi, for all their talents, don’t fit seamlessly into the well-oiled front three machine. It’s not a criticism of them individually, it’s just a reality that replacing any of the world’s best forward trio is no easy task.</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>And <b>Malone</b> also explained that Klopp will have to find the way to tighten the Reds up defensively before it proves costly:</p>
      <blockquote>What seemed a bit of an anomaly is now becoming a genuine Achille’s heel. That’s the sixth game in a row we have conceded, and it’s now only two clean sheets in 13 league games.<br/><br/>It hasn’t bitten us yet, but it has to be remedied before it does.</blockquote>
      <p>Finally, Mark Jones discussed <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>’s impending suspension, noting how it may be “a blessing in disguise” as it will afford the Brazilian a rest and Klopp a chance to experiment:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>‘s second half booking was his fifth of the season, and that might be a blessing in disguise for Liverpool.<br/><br/>After Klopp rested the Brazilian for the win at Villa in order to protect him for the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Manchester City</a> game, his most important midfielder will sit out Brighton at home next week through suspension. You’d think the Reds would win that, giving Klopp a chance to experiment.</blockquote>
