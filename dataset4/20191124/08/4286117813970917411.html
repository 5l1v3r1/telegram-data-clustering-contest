      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>India became the first team in Test history to register 4 successive innings wins</li>
        <li>This win was India's 7th in succession, which is their longest streak in Test cricket</li>
        <li>The result helped India gain 60 points and consolidate their position at the top of the World Test Championship table</li>
      </ul>
      <p>India wrapped up victory inside three days of a Test match for the second time in succession as they bowled out Bangladesh for 195 in their second innings to win the match by an innings and 46 runs and sweep the series 2-0 at the Eden Gardens stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Resuming their second innings at 152 for 6 on day 3, Bangladesh were hoping to make India bat again after a fighting 74 from Mushfiqur Rahim. But the former captain couldn't last long on the third day, adding just 15 runs to his overnight score of 59 before falling to Umesh Yada in the first hour of the first session.</p>
      <p>The lower-order batsmen couldn't last long either with Bangladesh's innings folding in just 41.1 overs in the final innings.</p>
      <p>Umesh Yadav was the pick of the Indian bowlers with 5 for 53 in 14.1 overs while Ishant Sharma bagged 4 wickets. All 9 Bangladeshi wickets were picked up by Indian pacers in this innings. Ishant finished with astonishing figures of 9 for 78 runs in the match after his five-wicket haul in the first innings.</p>
      <p>This win was India's 7th win in succession, which is their longest streak in Test cricket, surpassing their previous best of 6 wins in a row under MS Dhoni in 2013. It was also India's fourth consecutive innings win, which is a new world record in Test cricket. Virat Kohli also bettered his own record with his 12th successive series win and 4th Test series whitewash as captain.</p>
      <p>This was India's final home Test of this season and of 2019. The result helped India gain another 60 points and consolidate their position at the top of the ICC World Test Championship. India are comfortably placed at the top with 360 points from 7 matches.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Saturday, the Indian bowlers once again dominated the proceedings in the twilight period as they reduced the visitors to 152 for 6 in 32.3 overs after India declared at 347 for 9 with a 241-run lead in the first innings.</p>
      <p>Captain Kohli gave his pacers enough time to make use of the conditions late in the day and they responded with Ishant getting 4 wickets while Umesh bagged two.</p>
      <p>At one stage it seemed like the match would be over inside two days with Bangladesh reeling at 13 for 4 but a 69-run partnership between two of their most senior batsmen - Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah - halted India's charge for victory.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Bangladesh, Mahmudullah had to retire hurt on 39 due to a hamstring injury in the final session. Mushfiqur though, carried on the fight and got to his 21st Test fifty in just 54 balls.</p>
      <p>He added another 51 runs with concussion substitute Mehidy Hasan Miraz before Ishant had the latter caught at first slip by Kohli in the second half of the final session.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur and Taijul Islam's 19-run stand for the 7th wicket helped Bangladesh delay the inevitable and take the game into the third day. Taijul, who also came in as a concussion substitute in this match, was the last batsman to be dismissed before stumps were drawn on day 2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virat Kohli shines with historic hundred</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Eden Gardens crowd was treated to a Virat Kohli masterclass on Saturday as the India captain became the 1st from the country to hit a hundred in a Pink ball Test.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli spoke at length about the challenges of facing the pink ball in the lead up to the historic Test but the skipper was at ease throughout his 194-ball stay at the middle.</p>
      <p>Kohli hit 18 boundaries as he dominated the Bangladesh attack. He was looking set for a double hundred but was caught in the deep on 136, thanks to a stunning effort from Taijul Islam. Kohli was in disbelief even as he walked back to the dressing room with a standing ovation from the packed crowd at the Eden.</p>
