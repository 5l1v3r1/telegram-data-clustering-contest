        <b>What’s cooking? Will Asim Riaz and Himanshi Khurana take their friendship to another level in BB13? Asim's soft corner for Himanshi has now become more evident. Even Shefali Jariwala hinted that something's brewing between the two</b>

      <p>Is love finally blossoming in the Bigg Boss 13 house? While the previous seasons introduced to us to many couples such as Tanisha Mukerji-Armaan Kohli, Gauahar Khan-Kushal Tandon, Prince Narula-Yuvika Chaudhary, Karishma Tanna-Upen Patel, seems like 13th season has one relationship in making. It’s none other than our angry boy Asim Riaz and wild card entrant Himanshi Khurana. Though there are no confessions made by either of the housemates, Shefali Jariwala hints of the same and confronts Asim about it as well.</p>
      <p>While Asim’s warring side has being witnessed by the audience time and again as he locked horns with Sidharth Shukla, his soft corner for Himanshi, too seems to be captured by the BB cameras. In the recent episode, Asim’s feelings for Himanshi were positively reciprocated by her. The Punjabi model-singer, confessed of liking Asim like a friend. The change happened when Asim took care of her, when she had fallen sick, thus terming him as a true gentleman and good friend.

      <p>While the two lay in the bed, Shefali who is good friends with both, confronted Asim on the same, and also funnily took their case. Later when Shefali asked Asim to confess his feeling for Himanshi, initially he says he can’t do it, but later denies of having such feeling for Himnashi.</p>
      <p>Hmm now we are confused, does Asim really has a soft corner for Himanshi, or is it just another twist in the game?</p>
