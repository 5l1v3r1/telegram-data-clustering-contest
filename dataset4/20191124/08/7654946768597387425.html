      <h1>NYPD says Bronx man shot romantic rival — then had mom hire hitman</h1>

      <p>A Bronx man fled to Florida after shooting a neighbor six times in a spat over a woman — and police have now busted both him and his mother, saying she tried to hire a hitman to finish the job, sources told The Post.</p>
      <p>The mayhem started Sept. 2, when accused shooter Candido Lizarra, 25, got into an early-morning argument with another resident in the fifth-floor hallway of their Bronx NYCHA apartment complex on E. 178th Street near Boston Road in Fordham, the sources said.</p>
      <p>As the two squabbled over a woman, Lizarra pulled out a gun and opened fire on his 20-year-old romantic rival, striking him half a dozen times and lodging a bullet in his spine, sources said.</p>
      <p>The victim, whose name was not released, was rushed to St. Barnabas in serious condition — but, amazingly, survived.</p>
      <p>Lizarra, fearing that the wounded man might later testify against him, hatched a plan, sources alleged.</p>
      <p>He asked his mother, Annette Spann, also of The Bronx, to arrange for his victim to be killed, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Spann, 45, put out word she was looking for a hitman — but police caught wind of her plans and sent an undercover officer to meet her.</p>
      <p>During that Nov. 15 encounter, Spann allegedly promised to pay $1,000 cash up front for the killing, as well as an additional payment afterward, sources said.</p>
      <p>Both were arrested Friday after detectives from the 48th Precinct caught wind of the plot — the son was busted by Bronx Violent Felony Squad cops in Florida, and the mom in The Bronx, police sources said.</p>
      <p>Lizarra is awaiting extradition.</p>
