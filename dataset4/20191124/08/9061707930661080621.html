      <p>A Winshill mum was shocked into losing four stone following a stark warning from a colleague - and is now helping others do the same.</p>
      <p>Angela Grist started piling on the pounds after the births of her children.</p>
      <p>But after a recent health scare she decided enough was enough and swapped fish and chips for fresh fruit.</p>
      <p>Angela, 55, said: "When the children were younger I just got used to looking after them first.</p>
      <p>"I worked full time so I was cooking child-friendly meals that weren't always the healthiest, and eating out more.</p>
      <p>"I have always eaten quite healthily but would have takeaways if I was tired.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it was just <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids/christmas-market-food-festival-guide-3538412">easier to go to the fish and chip shop</a>.</p>
      <p>"I was also drinking alcohol more regularly then I do now; I would have it three or four times a week.</p>
      <p>"Before I knew it, my weight was creeping up.</p>

      <p>"You try to lose weight and think you can manage it, but then, when you are happy and comfortable in a relationship and you get complacent, the weight piles on again."</p>
      <p>Angela, who works in mental health services, said she felt her weight was holding her back on a trip to New York, but her wake-up call came from a colleague who warned her about her health.</p>
      <p>She said: "I couldn’t enjoy the things I wanted to. I went to New York with my husband and I struggled walking round everywhere.</p>

      <p>"Then a couple of years ago I had a brain scan as I was getting quite severe headaches. Thankfully the scan was all clear but I spoke to a colleague about it.</p>
      <p>"I work in memory services so I asked one of my colleagues who is a doctor about it. He told me not to worry, but ten minutes later he came to find me and said I need to look after my cardiovascular hygiene, which basically told me to watch my <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids/christmas-market-food-festival-guide-3538412">weight and look after my cholesterol </a>and blood pressure.</p>
      <p>"Working with people with dementia I know that if those things are compromised there can be serious health risks.</p>
      <p>"It dawned on me then that I was putting my own health at risk and it made me change my lifestyle."</p>
      <p>The mother of two decided to join her local Slimming World group after previously having success with the programme.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have done it two or three times over a span of 25 years and this is my third journey with them.</p>
      <p>"It was the late 80s and early 90s when I first started and I hadn’t been in about 12 years when I decided to go back.</p>
      <p>"After meeting my husband, Simon, I wanted to enjoy life more.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to be able to go to normal shops and buy things off the rack."</p>
      <p>Angela tipped the scales at 15 stone and five pounds when she joined the Burton group in 2015 and was wearing sizes 16 to 18.</p>
      <p>But after changing her diet she says her life has been changed and she now fits in to sizes 10 to 12 - and sometimes an eight.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have lost nearly four stone in total and I feel like a different person.</p>

      <p>"My ultimate aim was to get healthier. I wanted to walk without getting out of breath and get my confidence back, but the change has been incredible.</p>
      <p>"I have been at my target weight for a couple of years now and I have much more energy and I feel more confident. I can actually dress up and look nice.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it is really easy to think I have reached target and take your foot off the gas, so I joined a social team which keeps me motivated and I am always trying to help others.</p>
      <p>"I have been called an inspiration and given the title of 'woman of the year' from the other slimmers.</p>
      <p>"It has changed the way I think about food.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/new-chinese-restaurant-set-open-3529517">"I batch-cook now. I get the cookbook</a> out and plan ahead and my husband is very supportive and gets involved too."</p>
      <p>Her newfound confidence has given Angela a boost and she is now taking a leap into helping others by joining Slimming World as a consultant.</p>
      <p>She said: "It is a bit daunting but I am very excited. I have been asked before but with working full time I couldn’t commit.</p>
      <p>"However, I am retiring next year and I have made so many encouraging friends that, when the opportunity came about, they gave me the belief I could do it."</p>
