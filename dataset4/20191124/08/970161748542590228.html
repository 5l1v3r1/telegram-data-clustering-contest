      <h1>Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick considering resigning over Unai Emery</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> chairman Sir Chips Keswick is reportedly considering resigning from the board over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>’s continued reign at the club and feels powerless to do anything.</p>
      <p>The Gunners failed to win yet again in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> on Saturday, escaping with a 2-2 draw at home to Southampton thanks to a brace from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexandre-lacazette/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> – though could easily have lost the match.</p>
      <p>Arsenal now sit in seventh place in the table, eight points adrift of the top-four spots, and have not won in the league since beating Bournemouth at the start of October.</p>

      <p>The pressure is now ramping up on Emery, with large sections of supporters turning on the manager and chanting for him to leave during Saturday’s clash at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403184/2019/11/23/as-arsenals-chairman-considers-resigning-how-bad-does-it-have-to-get-before-emery-goes/">The Athletic</a>, those noises were heard loud and clear in the boardroom and Sir Chips – who has been chairman since taking over from Peter Hill-Wood in 2013 – felt ‘compelled’ to consider handing in his resignation.</p>

      <p>He feels he has been frozen out from the decision-making process over Emery’s future and does not want to ‘carry the can’ for the current discontent.</p>
      <p>Technical director Edu and head of football Raul Sanllehi are the two key players in Arsenal’s hierarchy now and intend to give Emery more time before reassessing his position.</p>
      <p>Managing director Vinai Venkatesham, chief negotiator Huss Fahmy and Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan, make up the decision-making group, with Sir Chips having been sidelined with virtually no say in Emery’s future.</p>

      <p>Should the 79-year-old, who is a lifelong Arsenal fan, walk away from the club it would end a long association with the Gunners, having first become a director back in 2005.</p>
      <p>Emery is believed to have three more Premier League games to turn Arsenal’s season around – against Norwich, Brighton and West Ham – and any further slip-ups could see him axed, particularly with north London rivals Tottenham having acted so decisively.</p>
