      <p>There was a very weepy end to Saturday night's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>, as Jacqueline Jossa broke down in tears.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star discovered that she had been voted to do yet another trial by viewers.</p>
      <p>She and fellow campmate Ian Wright will be taking on the Crevice of Cruelty.</p>
      <p>The grim trial will see the pair in an underground cavern, where they will have to unlock stars while facing creepy crawlies and reptiles.</p>

      <p>"I don't want to do any more man," wept the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>Her other campmates rushed to console her, as viewers became concerned for her wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Fans of the mum of two are now begging other viewers to stop voting for her.</p>
      <p>One wrote on Twitter: "Stop voting for Jacqueline to do the trials she’s done enough, you’ve broken the poor girl."</p>
      <p>Another posted: "Can everyone stop voting for Jac please, can’t you see the girl needs a break. She’s breaking."</p>
      <p>A third noted: "Jac is really struggling in there; yes, she knew what was ahead. But she didn't realise how hard it would be walking away from her family for 3 wks.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, she's been out of work for a while so she's probably barely spent a day away from Mia #ImACeleb #imacelebrity"</p>
      <p>It had been an emotional episode for Jac, who cried after receiving her luxury item - a pillow with the faces of her babies, Ella, four, and Mia, one, on it.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time, Jacqueline has had a meltdown over a task; she cried when she was picked to do the Snake Hotel trial with Myles Stephenson.</p>

      <p>She also lost it ahead of the Face Your Fears trial. The soap star went on to smash both trials, winning praise from viewers for her grit.</p>
