      <h1>'I told my seven-year-old and she cried' - Disabled veteran speaks out on council fence feud</h1>
      <h2>Gateshead Council says Wardley man Gavin Brierley knew that his fence doesn't have the proper planning permission</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>A disabled Navy veteran has found himself at the centre of row with the council - and faces being taken to court if he doesn't take down his fence.</p>
      <p>Gavin Brierley, 32, brought his house in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/wardley--leam-lane-1554372">Wardley</a> in February, and following extensive refurbishment work moved in with his wife Emma and their children.</p>
      <p>He purchased his Sundridge Drive home with a compensation payment he received from the the Motor Insurers' Bureau, after a hit-and-run in 2012 left him with life-changing injuries.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-three, who now works in technical support, said the crash left him with brain damage, a bad back, and deaf in one ear.</p>
      <p>Mr Brierley is in a feud with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead-council">Gateshead Council</a>, who have ordered him to pull down his fence because it encloses land classed as public open space.</p>
      <p>"The council is saying that I have to maintain the land but at the same time are saying that someone can stand on that land and I can't tell them to get off," he said.</p>
      <p>"If you were to stand on that triangle of land I wouldn't be able to tell you to get off, but that land is 100% mine. I own that land, even the council don't argue with that."</p>
      <p>Now, the authority has sent Mr Brierley a letter saying that if he doesn't remove his fence by early December he will be taken to court.</p>
      <p>The letter warned Mr Brierley that if he doesn't comply with the enforcement notice he could be fined up to £20,000 and if the case is indicted, or taken to Crown Court, he could face an unlimited fine.</p>
      <p>He continued: "I'm stressed out. It is putting a strain on me and my wife and my kids. I am a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/armed-forces">veteran</a>, I have served my country, I haven't done anything to deserve this.</p>

      <p>"I have been expecting this letter and every time the post comes it is the fear of getting a letter from the council.</p>
      <p>"I don't have the money to fight this. It is a patch of grass for three children to play on, but without a fence I won't be able to let them use it unsupervised.</p>
      <p>"I told my seven-year-old about it and she cried. I have a two and a five-year-old who will think the same. What have the council got to lose over this patch of grass?</p>
      <p>"It is shocking, it is like North Korea. What is the council going to get out of this? They're fighting for something they don't want."</p>
      <p>Mr Brierley also claims that the council has no proof that the land is public open space.</p>
      <p>The council said it has always made it clear that the triangle shaped plot of land next to Mr Brierley's garden doesn't have planning permission for a fence because it is classed as public open space.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the council said that the authority's officers went to "considerable trouble" to make Mr Brierley understand the situation before he purchased the house in February.</p>
      <p>He added: "Mr Brierley knew when he bought this house that the piece of land at the side of his garden was public open space which had been unlawfully fenced-in by the previous owner, and that it was now the subject of legal enforcement action – because his solicitor will have told him so.</p>
      <p>"We also had lengthy conversations with Mr Brierley before he bought the house to ensure he understood the implications of what he might be getting into. The reasons for the enforcement notice were explained very carefully. However, he chose to buy the house in full knowledge of this.</p>
      <p>"We have tried at every turn to help Mr Brierley, but ultimately if he does not accede to the requirements of the enforcement notice then the council will have no alternative but to turn to the courts."</p>
