      <h1>[Live: $200 off Pixel 4 + $449 Pixel Slate] Google Store Black Friday deals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:10:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>The Google Store today is providing a “<a href="https://store.google.com/?hl=en-US">sneak peek</a>” at its upcoming Black Friday 2019 deals. Kicking off Thursday, November 28th, highlights include $200 off the Pixel 4 and a bundle that packs Stadia Premiere Edition with Nest Wifi.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/24</b>: As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/08/pixel-4-black-friday/">revealed</a> earlier this month, the unlocked (and Google Fi) <a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_4">Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</a> is discounted $200. Until Cyber Monday on December 2nd, the 64 GB Pixel 4 is $599 and the 128 GB model is $699, while the Pixel 4 XL starts at $699 and goes to $799. All storage and color configurations — except the Oh So Orange Pixel 4 XL — are currently available.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Google has discounted the Pixel 3 XL an additional $50 to $549 (64GB) and $649 (128GB). Only Not Pink remains with the smaller phone and all other 2018 models <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/19/pixel-3-out-of-stock/">unavailable</a>.</p>
      <p>Also kicking off Sunday is a $350 discount on <a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_slate">all Pixel Slate models</a>. The Core m3/8GB/64GB is $449, i5/8GB/128GB is $649, and i7/16GB/256GB is $1,249. To further move sales, Google is throwing in a free Pixelbook Pen ($99) and Pixel Slate Keyboard ($199) or Brydge G-Type Keyboard ($159.99) for a max savings of $648.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>The Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL will see a $100 discount to start at $299 and $379.</p>
      <p>The most interesting deal is a bundle that includes <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/22/stadia-founders-edition/">Stadia Premiere Edition</a> and Nest Wifi, specifically the three-pack that features a router and two points. This $349 connectivity solution, along with the $129 Stadia Controller and Chromecast Ultra, will be $398 instead of $478.</p>
      <p>Google and Nest Wifi has a special option to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/03/google-nest-wifi-stadia/">prioritize Stadia connectivity</a>, and that synergy is clearly on display. Other notable Google Store Black Friday 2019 deals include:</p>
