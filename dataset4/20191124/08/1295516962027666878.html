      <h3>COMIC LEGEND:</h3>
      <p>Len Wein effectively continued his run on Hot Wheels at Gold Key Comics' Mod Wheels.</p>
      <h3>STATUS:</h3>
      <p>Basically True</p>
      <p>It is kind of amazing to think of, as just a few short years later, Len Wein would be one of the most popular writers in comics (and by the end of the decade, he would have been writing pretty much all of Marvel's top comic books before DC lured him over to their side by giving him one THEIR most popular characters, Batman and Superman), but at the start of the 1970s, Wein was essentially taking whatever assignments he could get his hands on. Basically the stuff that other writers didn't want to do.</p>

      <p>One of those first regular gigs was writing DC's licensed comic, Hot Wheels, tying in to the animated series of the same era based on the <a href="https://screenrant.com/hot-wheels-movie-mattel/">Hot Wheels</a> line of toy cars...</p>

      <p>Since these comics were drawn by Alex Toth, one of the greatest artists in comic book history, the comics are actually pretty darn good. It starred Jack Wheeler and his friends as they get into various car-related misadventures...</p>

      <p>The series ended around the end of 1970. At the same time, though, Gold Key Comics then launched a knockoff version of the concept called Mod Wheels...</p>

      <p>The book ostensibly starred the same cast as an earlier short-lived Gold Key series called The Modniks...</p>

      <p>Just now driving hot rods, but when Wein took over the book, he basically just decided to turn it into Hot Wheels part two (working with artists Jack Adler and Sal Trapini).</p>
      <p>He explained it to Roger Slifer in an excellent interview in <a href="http://www.tcj.com/the-len-wein-interview/">The Comics Journal #48</a>, "At the time, I was writing the Phantom Stranger, I was writing regularly for everybody. I was working for DC, and I was doing some work for Skywald, Sol Brodskyâ€™s old company. I was writing Westerns for them. For Gold Key, I was doing Star Trek and Mod Wheels, which was their answer to the Hot Wheels book I did at DC. In fact, when I took over the book, I just took the same cast, changed their names, changed their visual appearance slightly, and kept doing the same stories I was doing on the other book. I was working, pretty much, everywhere when I came back to DC to the Phantom Stranger. I was doing a lot of stuff for Gold Key."</p>
      <p>Here's a much later Mod Wheels story by Paul S. Newman and Jack Sparling (I don't have any of Wein's early issues - if anyone has a scan of some of the pages that they'd like to pass along, I'd gladly post it), starring "Wheels" (instead of Jack Wheeler) and the gang as they encounter a jerky driver...</p>

      <p>Wein only lasted a year or so on Mod Wheeels, as he started to get better assignments at DC and Marvel. Still, I love the boldness of just saying, "Hey, why not just keep doing what I was doing?"</p>
