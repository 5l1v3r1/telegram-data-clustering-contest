      <p>Just a month to go now. Here’s some new footage to tide you over.</p>
      <p>In a newly released 30-second TV spot for <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/the-future-of-star-wars-movies-kathleen-kennedy-explains-the-vast-possibilities"><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, things are coming to a head. We see and hear some familiar things: Rey and Ben gearing up for a climactic confrontation, Luke imploring a listener (probably Rey) to face fear, as confronting fear is “the destiny of a Jedi.” We’ve got some new stuff, too: a big, big, big laser tearing into the ground, more glimpses of the chaos of the various battles between <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/this-important-last-jedi-meet-up-happened-thanks-to-colin-trevorrow">Resistance</a> and First Order across the sequel’s varied locations, and, perhaps most interestingly, a glimpse of the Knights of Ren, gathering in the desert.</p>

      <p>Soon, we might find out what the Knights’ deal is. And we’ll find out how Palpatine came back. And is <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/rise-of-skywalkers-new-character-posters-are-simply-beautiful">Rey</a> a clone? Probably not, but <i>is she????</i></p>
      <p>(No.)</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker</i> comes out December 19, 2019. </p>
