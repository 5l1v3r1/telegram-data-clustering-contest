      <p>VFS TasHeel, an authorised visa service provider for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has announced the launch of its tourist visa services in Nigeria and 29 other countries.</p>
      <p>The firm said in a statement that the centres would provide convenient visa and biometric enrolment services for Saudi tourist visa applicants, which would enable pilgrims to travel for Umrah on a tourist visa outside of Hajj season.</p>
      <p>According to Saudi Arabia’s new visa policy, nationals of the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia, Algeria, Bahrain, Cameroon, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Maldives, Nigeria, Philippines, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan can apply for a tourist visa.</p>
      <p>It said the visa process was open to applicants from all nationalities, except the 49 that were eligible for a visa on arrival or e-visa.</p>
      <p>The statement read in part, “The increasing openness of international markets brings immense opportunities to the tourism sector and Saudi Arabia’s new policies acknowledge that tourism has an important role to play in the kingdom’s social and economic development.</p>
      <p>“In support of the government’s initiatives, we are pleased to offer tourist visa services in 30 countries, and make the entire process more seamless and convenient for potential leisure travellers and pilgrims for Umrah.”</p>
