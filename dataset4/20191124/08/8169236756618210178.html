        <b>Real Madrid misfit Gareth Bale has been given some surprise praise from pundit Stan Collymore despite controversially posing with a flag mocking his club after Wales’ recent win over Hungary.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Tottenham man was notably seen posing and celebrating with a flag that suggested he prioritised playing golf over playing for his current club, something which did <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/23/video-gareth-bale-jeered-by-real-madrid-fans-after-making-return-from-wales-duty/">not go down well with his fans as he was jeered</a> upon making his return to action for them this weekend.</p>

      <p>Bale has often had a difficult relationship with Madrid in recent times, and Collymore actually says he thinks the Welshman’s slightly mocking gesture towards Los Blancos is justified.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-should-sack-ole-20948567?2">Daily Mirror</a>, the former Liverpool star accused Real of not respecting Bale either, and praised the player for hitting back.</p>
      <p>He said: “I love the fact Gareth Bale stuck it to Real Madrid and the Madridistas by celebrating Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification success with a ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order’ banner.</p>
      <p>“It was the same as scoring a goal and running past the away end while giving them the bird.</p>

      <p>“He has been dealt with appallingly by Real and Zinedine Zidane, who should know better after his own experiences as a player.</p>
      <p>“Had Zidane and Real treated Bale anywhere near what his status in the game deserves, then he wouldn’t have felt the need to do it.”</p>
      <p>While Collymore may have a point about how Real have perhaps overlooked Bale’s fine contributions to the club, it does still seem highly unprofessional of Bale to have aimed a dig at them in this way while still contracted to them.</p>
      <p>Any justified criticisms could no doubt wait until he leaves the Bernabeu or once he retires from playing.</p>
