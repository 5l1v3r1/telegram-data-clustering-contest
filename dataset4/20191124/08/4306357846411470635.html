      <h2>Manchester United are Gareth Bale's most likely route back to the Premier League, according to a report in Spain</h2>

      <h3>Manchester United are still Gareth Bale’s most likely route back to the Premier League, according to a report in Spain.</h3>
      <p>Spanish media outlet <i>Mundo Deportivo</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://talksport.com/football/633369/man-utd-gareth-bale-jose-mourinho-tottenham/">talkSPORT</a>, is reporting that Manchester United are Bale’s “premier option” with regards to a return to the English top flight.</p>
      <p>The same article appears to play down fresh speculation linking the Wales international with a return to Tottenham Hotspur following Jose Mourinho’s appointment last week.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Mourinho’s hiring as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement makes Bale’s proposed return to the north London side less likely.</p>
      <p>The story goes on to suggest that a swap deal involving Bale and Paul Pogba is still a possibility.</p>
      <p>Bale was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jose-mourinho-plans-gareth-bale-signing-tottenham-11192489/">linked</a> with a move to Tottenham earlier this week after Mourinho took over the reins of the Champions League runners-up from Argentinian head coach Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Bale netted 55 times in 203 games in all competitions during six seasons at Tottenham before the former PFA player of the year completed a then world-record move to Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The Welshman has won three Champions League titles and a La Liga crown at Real Madrid.</p>
