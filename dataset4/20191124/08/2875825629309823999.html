      <h1>Football Manager 2020: The top 10 players on Sports Interactive’s new game</h1>
      <h2>The newest edition of the Football Manager franchise has dropped - and some of the world's biggest names are the most impressive players on the new game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Toby Durant</a></address>
      <p>Every armchair manager’s favourite game is finally here. Football Manager 2020 dropped on Tuesday to rave reviews.</p>
      <p>Real life overtook the digital world with the news that Mauricio Pochettino had been sacked by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur and replaced by Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>If that isn’t your ideal managerial move you can instead replace Poch with yourself on Sports Interactive’s new game.</p>
      <p>Winning football games is often down to the quality on the pitch, so if you want to jump into the hot seat armed with the finest talent on the game, then you want to be managing these players.</p>
      <h3>1. Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool</h3>
      <p>The big centre back has been in the running for every major award over the last year, and with good reason. He was at the heart of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s successful run in Europe and their drive this season for that long-dreamed of Premier League title.</p>
      <p>The Dutch defender starts the game with 18 heading, 18 decisions, and17 tackling - making him a brick wall at the back.</p>

      <h3>2. Mohamed Salah, Liverpool</h3>
      <p>Another quality player at Liverpool makes them a prime candidate for trophies should you decide to oust Jurgen Klopp. The right winger has been banging in the goals for a while at Anfield, and in FM 20 he can do the same for you.</p>
      <p>His 18 pace, 18 finishing, and 18 off the ball make him deadly at the sharp end of the pitch, and as a natural wide on the right or up front he can fit in any tactic too.</p>
      <h3>3. Antoine Griezmann, Barcelona</h3>
      <p>France’s talisman has had quite the run of late, leading his country to World Cup glory last year before making a massive £107 million move to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>A natural striker, Griezmann is perfectly at home at AMC or wide on the left, making him a versatile threat for his new team. With 19 first touch, 18 finishing, and 17 dribbling he can weave his way through any defence.</p>

      <h3>4. Luis Suarez, Barcelona</h3>
      <p>Another Barca forward, Suarez can take a bite out of any team in the world on Football Manager 2020 even at 32.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan forward has 19 determination, 18 finishing, and 18 flair to get him to the ball and find the back of the net.</p>
      <h3>5. Eden Hazard, Real Madrid</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> ’s latest Galactico takes up a deserved spot among FM20’s best players. After his reported £32 million move from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in the summer, Hazard is leading Madrid’s charge against Barcelona this season in La Liga.</p>
      <p>At home as an AMC or left winger, Hazard’s 20 dribbling, 20 agility, and 18 technique means he can humiliate defenders and create goals at will.</p>

      <h3>6. Kylian Mbappe, Paris Saint-Germain</h3>
      <p>The youngest player on this list, Kylian Mbappe is almost a guarantee to top it one of these years. France &amp; PSG’s starlet can play anywhere in the front three, and after his exploits at the World Cup is likely to dominate world football for years to come.</p>
      <p>Mbappe’s electric 20 pace and 20 acceleration helps his 18 dribbling and 17 finishing create chaos in the ranks of the opposition.</p>
      <h3>7. Neymar, Paris Saint-Germain</h3>
      <p>Mbappe’s teammate is next. The Brazilian icon Neymar has been a headline machine for most of his career and his move from Barcelona to PSG is responsible for the new, crazy, transfer market that dominates football.</p>
      <p>Neymar possesses the magical combination of 20 dribbling, 20 technique, 19 off the ball, and 19 flair that makes him a creative force on the left wing, but he can also find the back of the net with his 16 finishing.</p>

      <h3>8. Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester City</h3>
      <p>The honour of best Premier League player in FM20 goes to Man City’s maestro Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian midfielder is at home in the centre of a traditional midfield or as the AMC behind a striker. He’s also competent on either wing.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne is a true master with the ball at his feet. With 20 vision, 19 passing, 19 crossing, and 18 decisions he can deliver the perfect ball from almost anywhere on the pitch. He’s also got 16 finishing and 16 long shots to find the back of the net when the opportunity arrises.</p>
      <h3>9. Cristiano Ronaldo, Zebre (Juventus)</h3>
      <p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ’ exclusive deal with PES 2020 the team is named Zebre in Football Manager 2020. Other than that though they are as you would expect, and so is <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> .</p>
      <p>The Portuguese superstar is a natural on the left wing or up front and despite being 34 still has 20 natural fitness and 16 pace to terrorise defenders, while his 20 determination 29 finishing, 19 heading, and 19 long shots make him the most well-rounded forward in front of goal.</p>

      <h3>10. Lionel Messi, Barcelona</h3>
      <p>The top spot though, goes to his great rival Lionel Messi. The little Argentine genius is a natural up front, on the right wing, and at AMC and has 2 years on Ronaldo at the age of 32.</p>
      <p>Messi has an amazing 10 stats that get the maximum 20 rating, including dribbling, finishing, passing, and vision. With 19 anticipation, 18 composure and 17 long shots he is impossible to stop. Just don’t set him as your long throw taker!</p>
