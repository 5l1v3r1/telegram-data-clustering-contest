      <p><b>Minneapolis</b>: A family friend of a 5-year-old who survived after being thrown from a third-storey balcony at the Mall of America in Minnesota says the boy is back in school and walking without a limp.</p>
      <p>Noah Hanneman posted on a GoFundMe page that the boy, named Landen, was released from the hospital in early August and is “now walking PERFECTLY with even legs.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The post says Landen returned home with a limp and uneven legs from a two-time broken femur and has had “many physical therapies” to work on his walking.</p>
      <p>The attack happened on April 12. Landen plunged 40 feet (12 meters) when he was randomly grabbed by Emmanuel Aranda and tossed over the railing.</p>
      <p>Aranda pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 19 years in prison.</p>
