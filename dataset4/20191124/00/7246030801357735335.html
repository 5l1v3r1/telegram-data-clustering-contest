      <p>Surveillance camera footage from Thursday night shows a man hitting an Orthodox Jew on a sidewalk in Brooklyn, <i>CBS New York</i> <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/22/jewish-man-smacked-on-brooklyn-sidewalk/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The attack took place shortly before midnight on the corner of Sanford Street near Willoughby Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood of <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/bedford-stuyvesant/">Bedford-Stuyvesant</a>. Footage shows a stranger smacking the victim – who was dressed in traditional Orthodox garb, including a black hat – on a crowded street.</p>
      <p>Police said the 32-year-old man hit the 21-year-old victim without exchanging any words, proving that the attack was unprovoked. The victim, who suffered minor injuries, was treated at the scene.</p>
      <p>The suspect walked away from the scene after the attack but was later arrested on assault charges. There is no indication of the attack being a hate crime, according to investigators.</p>
      <p>[The attack happens 10 seconds into the embedded video below.]</p>
