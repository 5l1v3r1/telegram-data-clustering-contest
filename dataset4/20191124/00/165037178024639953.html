      <p>The British newspaper explains that the exact buyer is unknown, but that there is a consortium of <b>"wealthy individuals and companies</b> from different parts of the world" willing to put<b> 250 million euros</b> on the table.</p>

      <p>This new group will have the intention of <b>buying the whole club,</b> including the shares that the North Americans, Steve Parish and <b>minority shareholders </b>have, which would come to 215 million. In addition to this, they would have to pay the <b>35 million of debt</b> that the club is in.</p>
      <p>The buyers have finally launched after some doubts following <b>Wilfried Zaha</b>'s transfer request. After pre-empting a US business group and another related to <b>Thaksin Shinawatra</b>, the former owner of <b>Manchester City,</b> the club could even have new owners before Christmas.</p>
