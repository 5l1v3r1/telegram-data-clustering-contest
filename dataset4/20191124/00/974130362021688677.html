      <p>The best of this year's Camogie championship crop overcame the class of 2018 last night, claiming the spoils on the 2019 Camogie All-Stars trip to New York.</p>
      <p>On a chilly American night at Gaelic Park in the Bronx, both sides played out a seven-goal thriller with the 2019 class eventually running out easy winners on a scoreline of 5-19 to 2-11. Cork's Amy O'Connor was the star on the night, producing 3-5 of the winning side's overall tally with 3-4 coming into a devastating first-half performance.</p>

      <p>2019 All-Star Player of the Year Niamh Kilkenny also produced a noteworthy performance with an personal tally of 1-2 from play.</p>
      <p>For the 2018 class Cáit Devane was in fine form, the Tipperary forward scoring 1-7 under the lights at GAA HQ on the other side of the pond.</p>

      <p>After a successful tour to Madrid in 2017, some of the sport's best talents were arriving in the United States for the first time to showcase their ability, with many onlookers gobsmacked by the skills on show.</p>
      <p>Eyes are now quickly turning to the 2020 championship where Galway will be hoping to claim back-to-back titles before another round of All-Stars next autumn. Judging by the reaction to this year's tour, it's an accolade no player will want to miss out on.</p>
