      <p>Tamunotonye Ibiama’s name may not ring a loud bell but he has helped a lot of youths in a way or the other by investing in music, sports and security.</p>
      <p>As the Chief Executive Officer of Grafton Entertainment, he has used his resources to help artistes like Mr 2kay. These artistes are not signed to his record company again but he still has a good rapport with them.</p>
      <p>He has decided to invest more in sports as Grafton Entertainment is partnering Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) to discover sporting talents in Niger Delta and groom them to become international stars. Already, a football tournament has commenced in Bonny Kingdom, Rivers State.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the development, Tonye said: “This is part of the Corporate Social Responsibility of the NLNG. Apart from giving back to the community, we also want to create a lucrative world of football. There is an abundance of talents on the Island who are waiting to be developed and our task is to discover and groom them. We are also working with local scouts and administrators, and I can assure you that this is the beginning of an exciting era in the annals of our sports.”</p>
