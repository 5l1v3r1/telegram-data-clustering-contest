      <p>CAIRO - 24 November 2019: In a report entitled “Embracing the Madness in the City of Beautiful Chaos” in the British Express, Joe Miller highlighted the bustling and pleasant atmosphere of Cairo. <br/><br/>Miller’s report described Cairo as a city full of colors and beautiful smells, stressing that a visit to Cairo cannot be an inactive experience and that these loud voices are what makes the city so wonderful. <br/><br/>The report monitored scenes from the Egyptian street, such as taxi drivers at the airport, and the sounds of thousands of minarets. <br/><br/>"Cairo is a safari for the ears, an aural amuse-bouche. Even the dead of night is sound tracked by traffic, music and boat horns echoing down the Nile," Miller's report read. <br/><br/>Miller then continues to describe the vivid colors and scents of Cairo; "Across Africa's biggest city, endless brightly-colored markets and street stalls do their best to invade the eyes with the scents of a dozen countries' cuisines arriving on every breeze."</p>
