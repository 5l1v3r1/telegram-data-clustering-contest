      <h1>Chick-fil-A takes heat from bullies of the LGBTQ rage mob</h1>

        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> has long been an oasis for families seeking escape from an ever-colder, cynical world.</p>
      <p>It’s not just the delicious chicken sandwiches. It’s the background Christian music, the incredibly friendly staff and, yes, knowing you can support a company that’s held firm in the face of relentless pressure from the left.</p>
      <p>The bullying began in 2011, when an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> group called for a boycott of the chicken chain because it had sponsored a marriage seminar conducted by the Pennsylvania Family Institute, an affiliate of Family Research Council and Focus on the Family.</p>
      <p>In 2012, company President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-cathy/">Dan Cathy</a> stated in an interview that he believed marriage was created by God as the union of one man and one woman. “Guilty as charged,” he said half-jokingly.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> groups went ballistic. They held a nationwide boycott, which fizzled in the face of a far larger “buycott” that created block-long lines on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> Appreciation Day. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith showed his own pro-gay stripes at the time by gratuitously slamming it as the “National Day of Intolerance.” He belongs on MSNBC, not Fox, but I digress.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Despite massive support, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> caved a bit, quietly defunding any group that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> bullies deemed as cultural opponents, such as Family Research Council. But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> kept funding Christian charities like the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) and the Paul Anderson Youth Home in Georgia, which was founded with aid from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> founder Truett Cathy.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> Foundation donated $115,000 to the Salvation Army and $1.65 million to the FCA, according to an IRS tax form reported at Bisnow.com.</p>
      <p>The Salvation Army, the FCA and the Anderson Youth Home stand by the biblical definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Hence, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> rage mob has deemed them “haters.”</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> recently announced that some of its charitable agreements were expiring and that they were restructuring their giving, all hell broke loose. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> Foundation would henceforth give more to local charities that assist with “education, homelessness and hunger,” the company said. They cited Junior Achievement and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/covenant-house/">Covenant House</a> as representative recipients, with no mention of the Salvation Army, FCA or the Anderson Home.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>This was seen widely as a surrender to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> rage mob. An American Family Association petition to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> quickly drew nearly 100,000 signatures. The text says in part: “it looks like you are abandoning Christian values and agreeing with homosexual activists who say believing the Bible makes you a hater. Please clarify that you still hold to biblical teachings regarding human sexuality, marriage, and family, and reinstate these Christian ministries.”</p>
        <p>The company says it was merely restructuring its philanthropic giving around three needs — “education, homelessness and hunger.” They say they will give to “faith-based and non-faith-based” groups in the future, for example, Junior Achievement and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/covenant-house/">Covenant House</a>. The first group teaches kids the principles of business success and lacks no corporate support. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/covenant-house/">Covenant House</a> offers shelter and programs for homeless, runaway and trafficked youth.</p>
        <p>OK, but the Salvation Army has been doing this effectively for decades. Here’s the difference. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/covenant-house/">Covenant House</a> has earned the stamp of approval from True Colors United, a pro-gay group that celebrates Pride Month and other pro-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> events and demands “affirmation,” not just tolerance.</p>
        <p>The Salvation Army, which discriminates against none and welcomes homeless “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> youth,” maintains its biblical, denominational belief in marriage as God created it.</p>
        <p>Ironically, the Salvation Army has bent over backwards to accommodate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> activists, even extending marital benefits to same-sex couples. But they’ve not genuflected fully to the gay Baals, so they must be punished as a “hate group.”</p>
        <p>In any event, appeasement never works. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> pressure groups have already made more demands. They want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> to recite Mao-like recantations of their beliefs and denounce Focus on the Family and other Christian groups that once enjoyed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> funding.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake. This is not about these charities or even <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a>. It’s about intimidating everyone who won’t surrender to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> mob’s increasingly aggressive bullying.</p>
        <p>Several liberal mayors have moved to bar <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> from opening in their cities. Numerous campuses, spouting “inclusion,” have banned <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a>. The company recently had to close down a new store in Reading, England, in the face of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> mobs there. This is the criminalization of Christianity before our very eyes.</p>
        <p>Amid all this, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> has doubled its revenue and is now the third-largest fast-food chain in America. With annual sales exceeding $11 billion, the company is proof that you can stand by your values and prosper in the face of mob pressure. Until you don’t.</p>
        <p>Franklin Graham, perhaps the most prominent evangelical leader in America, and no “evangellyfish,” said he talked with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> Chairman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-cathy/">Dan Cathy</a> personally and was assured that the company was not giving in to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lgbtq/">LGBTQ</a> mob.</p>
        <p>Those of us who have loved <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> over the years sincerely hope this is the case, and that it’s not just damage control after an ill-conceived capitulation.</p>
        <p>If you cut deals with the left, don’t be surprised when they come back within minutes, munching a chicken sandwich and saying, “What have you done for me lately?”</p>
