      <p>It seems that getting attacked before <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> programming is becoming a thing these days.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt-takeover">NXT TakeOver: WarGames</a> pre-show opened up tonight with the news that member of Rhea Ripley's WarGames team, Mia Yim, was attacked backstage. Footage was shown of medical personnel checking on Yim, with Ripley in the background - and she didn't look happy.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, Yim was loaded into an ambulance to be taken to a local medical facility, which means she's out of the match. Ripley has picked Dakota Kai, who originallly campaigned to get Yim's spot, to replace her. Kai seemed upset about the attack on Yim and even suggested she wasn't prepared for the match.</p>

      <p>But, Ripley convinced her to fill in, so we'll see her in the match.</p>
      <p>And it looks like that match will actually kick off the show in Chicago tonight. So, we'll see where this all leads. Will we found out who has been performing these attacks?</p>
