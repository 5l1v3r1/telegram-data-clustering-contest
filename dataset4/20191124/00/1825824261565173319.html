      <p>The <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/toronto-raptors">Raptors</a> inch closer and closer to normalcy. They’ve endured a tough stretch of schedule despite injuries. Now they’ll endure an easy stretch of schedule with injuries, and soon, knock on wood, there won’t even be any injuries to endure at all.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296655/serge-ibaka">Serge Ibaka</a>, initially ruled out indefinitely following his ankle sprain way back at the start of the Raptors’ west coast road trip is listed as doubtful for tonight’s contest against the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/atlanta-hawks">Hawks</a>, but doubtful is better than out even if he’s for sure out tonight. With <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/319723/serge-ibaka">Ibaka</a> ahead of schedule and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/152220/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a> due back at the start of December it’s looking like the Raptors may finally be due for a stretch of smooth sailing.</p>

      <p>Tonight they’ll match up against an Atlanta Hawks team that’s been reeling ever since a 2-0 start led people to erroneously declare that the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299935/trae-young">Trae Young</a> for <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299925/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a> trade might not have been so bad actually. The Hawks have lost 5 in a row, and 8 of their last 10. Young is still good, he’s averaging 25 points and nearly 9 assists per game, but he’s being asked to do it all on offense the Hawks other youngsters, especially recent 10th overall pick <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/331058/cam-reddish">Cam Reddish</a> have struggled mightily, and the defence is as porous as any in the league.</p>
      <p>Still, Young’s three-point happy nature means could make the Hawks a threat for a random offensive explosion or two. Can the Raptors stave that off and come away with a win? Let’s watch.</p>
