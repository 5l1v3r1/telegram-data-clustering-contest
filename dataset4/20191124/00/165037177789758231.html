        <b>What a great game at Bramall Lane, as Sheffield United welcomed a struggling Man U, with the last 15 minutes being decisive for both teams!</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/sheffield-united">Sheffield United </a>faced <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at home in what proved to be a fascinating game for a lot of reasons.</p>
      <p>Sheffield got the game underway and were by far the better side for the first half. They had<b> good defence and good play on and off the ball! </b>Manchester United were poor and did not create any real chances or even seem a threat, as <b>Solskjaer's problems increased.</b></p>
      <p><b>De Gea </b>was great for United early on, as he prevented Sheffield from taking the lead, however he could not stop <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/j-fleck-40275">Fleck</a>'s 18th minute goal!<b> Mousset passed the ball into the box for Lundstram</b> on the right, who has a shot, which is blocked by De Gea, but<b> Fleck was there for the rebound</b> and finished it off! </p>
      <p>Sheffield<b> dominated the first half </b>and were all over Man U. All five of their shots in the first 25 minutes were on target.<b> A very rampant home side.</b> What a job <b>Chris Wilder </b>has done with his side, after being promoted from the Championship last year.</p>
      <p>The ref blew the whistle for half time and<b> Sheffield went into the break in the lead</b>, having played excellently. <b>Manchester United were awful</b> and could have conceded more if it wasn't for David De Gea. </p>
      <p>Early on in the second half (51st minute) Sheffield were in dreamland.<b> Pereira gave the ball away</b> and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-mousset-223258">Mousset </a>was there to take it from him. He had a shot from just outside the box and his <b>curling effort went straight into the bottom corner</b>. There wasn't much De Gea could do about it and Solskjaer was in despair for this.</p>

      <p>However, <b>United fought back with three goals in seven minutes. </b>A team that were non-existent for much of the game suddenly came to life! </p>
      <p>The goal came out of nowhere, but it was youngster <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/brandon-williams-426809">Brandon Williams</a> who put United back in the game with <b>an excellent finish after a great pass from James</b> on the right. A nervy last 15 minutes for Sheffield!</p>
      <p>Their second goal game 4 minutes later, Rashford put in an incredible cross and new sub <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-greenwood-427813">Greenwood</a> was there to slot it in the back of the net. <b>A first Premier League goal for the youngster</b>. Two young goalscorers brought Man U back from the dead!</p>
      <p><b>The third goal for the Reds came in the 78th minute</b>. Manchester United came alive, James' speed saw him get the ball in the box, he decisively passed the ball to<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-rashford-284437/"> Rashford</a>, who finished it off. Man U found themselves in front and Solskjaer was very happy. What a turn around! </p>
      <p>But the game wasn't over here, as <b>super sub Mcburnie proved! </b>Sheffield equalised in the 89th minute. A scuffle in the box saw <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/o-mcburnie-206019">Mcburnie</a> recieve the ball and slot it into the back of the net. De Gea got a touch on it, but it was not enough to stop it. <b>VAR</b> checked it for handball, but<b> the goal was eventually allowed.</b></p>
      <p>Full time meant that <b>both teams went away with a point.</b> Sheffield bossed the game and dominated for 70 minutes, but <b>Manchester United came alive all of a sudden</b> to really challenge them. However, Sheffield did not give up and<b> displayed their fighting character,</b> to get them a well-deserved point, which takes them to <b>sixth</b> in the table! </p>
