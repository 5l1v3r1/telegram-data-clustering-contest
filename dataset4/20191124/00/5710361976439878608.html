      <h1>Federer and Zverev Mexico City match breaks world attendance record</h1>

      <p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Broadcaster ESPN claimed a new world record for attendance at a tennis match on Saturday, with more than 42,000 people watching Germany's Alexander Zverev go down 6-3, 4-6, 2-6 to Roger Federer in an exhibition match in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>That smashed an almost decade-old record of 35,681 set at an exhibition game between Belgian Kim Clijsters and Serena Williams (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/williams-cos">WMB</a>) in Belgium in 2010.</p>
      <p>ESPN put the exact number of fans in Mexico Cityâ€™s bullring at 42,517.</p>
      <p>Even before Saturday's match, Federer had announced his intention to set a new world record for attendance when he meets Rafael Nadal in an exhibition match in South Africa in February.</p>
      <p>That duel will be staged at the Cape Town Stadium, which has a capacity of 55,000. It will also have the draw of a preceding doubles match in which Federer will partner Microsoft (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/microsoft-corp">MSFT</a>) founder Bill Gates and Nadal will play alongside South African comedian Trevor Noah.</p>
