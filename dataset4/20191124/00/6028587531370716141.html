      <p>Craig Bruyn is one of the artists I stumbled upon during Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkane/2019/10/07/artists-are-celebrating-their-favorite-bethesda-games-all-month-long-for-inktober/">Inktober fan-art celebration</a> last month. A professional artist who’s worked in the toy industry for 15 years, Bruyn has also drawn for animation, comics, and video games. Lately, his <a href="https://twitter.com/CraigBruyn">Twitter</a> and Instagram feeds are a source of lively, colorful fan art related to everything from <i>The Mandalorian</i> to <i>Fallout 76</i>, <i>The Outer Worlds</i>, <i>Borderlands</i>, and lots more in between. I spoke to him briefly about his process, his love of the wasteland, and where <i>Fallout</i> ought to go next.<b>Alex Kane:</b> I first found your work because of some <i>Fallout</i> fan art you’d posted on Twitter. Has <i>Fallout</i> been a part of your life for a while?</p>
      <p><b>Craig Bruyn:</b> I first got into the <i>Fallout</i> series with <i>Fallout 3</i>, and have been hooked ever since. I’m ashamed to admit I’ve never played the first two games; they were before my gaming addiction started.</p>
      <p><b>Kane:</b> How does the wasteland make you feel? When you’re playing, especially, or when you’re drawing your Vault Dweller taking on the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorched">Scorched</a>, what is it about that world that inspires you?</p>
      <p><b>Bruyn:</b> It’s weird that such a morbid setting has so much appeal, but I find the whole genre fascinating. I actually feel very relaxed when playing the <i>Fallout</i> games—unless I’m being mauled by a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw">Deathclaw</a>. There’s something about the solitude of the world. Even though you’re not alone out there, it’s the time between encounters, when you absorb the setting, the sounds, and the visuals, that really affects me. It’s quite powerful in that respect, and it allows you traverse the world at your own pace.</p>
      <p>As for the art inspiration, specifically, I’ve always loved worlds that are strongly fleshed out. Not just their presents but their pasts. The branding of products, all these different [in-world] companies, and how they help build such a great background narrative, even before the player’s story comes into play. This is the sort of foundation that inspires me when I start drawing characters.</p>
      <p>Anything I draw has to have a narrative to it in my head, even if it’s just a character sketch, and I think that’s something <i>Fallout</i> has always done really well. And I’m not necessarily talking about player-driven narrative; more the unconscious narrative and lore you absorb when you participate in the world.</p>

      <p><b>Kane:</b> Do you ever work directly from the game, sort of in the middle of a play session?</p>
      <p><b>Bruyn:</b> Ha ha, that’s a definite no. Drawing and gaming are two of my favorite things, but so different in their experience. When I game, for me, it’s about total immersion. That’s why I love narrative games. I am one hundred percent in that world, and I don’t want to leave.</p>
      <p>Drawing is something very different. I do a lot of my sketching in café. It’s another very immersive experience, in a way, but it’s more relaxed. Less intense; you’re just sitting back and drinking coffee. But great games stick with you, and so do ideas for sketches. I never have to worry—when I’m gaming, if an idea strikes me, I know a strong idea will sit with me until later, when it’s time to execute in the right mindset. Besides, I’m so bad at gaming that it requires my full concentration.</p>
      <p><b>Kane:</b> What supplies do you work with as part of your process, typically? Do you sort of use a mix of digital and ink?</p>
      <p><b>Bruyn:</b> I always try and do my prelim work and ink stages traditionally. And in a café, with a coffee and my dog, whenever possible. The color work, though, is always done on computer using Photoshop. Professionally, it’s a bit different: I tend to do everything on computer using a Cintiq tablet. It’s definitely quicker and much more versatile for the high-speed, multiple-changes aspect of the workplace.</p>
      <p><b>Kane:</b> Any favorite <i>Fallout</i> memories, in terms of experiences you’ve had in the world of Appalachia? Or in the Commonwealth?</p>
      <p><b>Bruyn:</b> Oh, wow, there’s so many. I honestly adore the whole series, but there is something about the quirkiness and freedom of <i>New Vegas</i> that really resonates with me. I still remember the first time I thought I’d just stroll through <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Quarry_Junction">Quarry Junction</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Fallout 76</i> is an interesting one for me, and was the most difficult to take to, mostly because I wasn’t prepared for how little the story would drive me. But then, once I got to exploring, I actually found myself just loving that world, and wandering alone and discovering all the ghosts and history of Appalachia.</p>
      <p>All said and done, though, my favorite thing in the entire <i>Fallout</i> series was <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dogmeat_(Fallout_4)">Dogmeat</a>, and any time I got to spend with the furry little guy. A lot of the time my own dog, Oreo, will sit at my feet when I game, and somehow Dogmeat almost made it feel like I was playing co-op with him.</p>

      <p><b>Kane:</b> Where do you hope to see the series go in the future?</p>
      <p><b>Bruyn:</b> I’m excited to see where <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more"><i>Wastelanders</i></a> takes <i>76</i>. I think that’ll really take the game to its true potential. And, as for the series in general, something like stepping outside of the United States to a new country might be interesting. I do hope they keep the narrative and storytelling aspects of the game, and stay true to the type of game they’ve done such a great job in creating. I can go elsewhere for a high-intensity, all-action fix, but <i>Fallout</i>’s where I escape to when I just want to get lost in a world.</p>
      <p><b>Kane:</b> <i>Fallout</i>’s having a bit of a weird moment right now, with a lot of players angry about the Fallout 1st service and such. But how do you feel about the <i>community</i>—the core players you interact with?</p>
      <p><b>Bruyn:</b> The community has quite a few different segments to it. In-game, I think it’s one of the healthier and more positive online communities I’ve ever played in, but they are certainly being tested by some interesting strategic decisions that are being made. Just seeing what the proactive community is doing in <i>76</i> with the sandbox we have is fantastic.</p>
      <p>Players are adding to the richness of the world with some of the amazing things they’re creating. Heck, it’s the first time I’ve ever made three different characters in a game and leveled them all to fifty, and that is solely due to the amount of freedom we’re allowed. I really do love the player base, and I’ve found a really amazing community springing up on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/craig_bruyn/">Instagram</a>, sharing their creations, characters, stories, and all these incredible camps.</p>
      <p>I do feel the pain, and point of view, of those who are angry with some of the stuff that’s happening, and it’s sad that so much negative press has surrounded this game. I know, as gamers, we expect a lot, but <i>Fallout</i> is one of those franchises that’s been lucky to have a very loyal and supportive player base. Everybody wants a certain thing, and when there’s that much passion, unfortunately, there’s often division.</p>
      <p>I hope that <i>Fallout</i> will get through these rocky times, and come out stronger and more educated from it. After all, we rarely learn from our success; it’s our <i>missteps</i> that build character and make us stronger.</p>
