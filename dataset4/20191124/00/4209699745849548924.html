      <p>The Lagos State Government has sealed off Multipak Nigeria Ltd., a plastic producing factory situated in the Oregun area of the city, for violation of safety rules and regulations, poor house-keeping and lack of signage, which allegedly led to the death of a worker, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Director-General of Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr Lanre Mojola, made the announcement on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Mojola said the factory was sealed up following the Lagos State Government’s declaration of zero tolerance for factories and private organisations that violate safety rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>The DG said, “Lagos State Government seals off Multipak factory for violation of safety rules and regulations, as well as poor house-keeping and lack of signage.</p>
      <p>“The poor house-keeping led to the untimely death of Mr Femi Olatunde, a factory worker who got his head stuck while operating one of the machines.</p>
      <p>“On no account should any factory operate without putting in place safety equipment, quality house-keeping, signage, good wiring system and a clean environment devoid of hazards to the lives of workers and visitors.”</p>
