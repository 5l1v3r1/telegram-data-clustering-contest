      <p>Intel-owned automotive chip developer Mobileye has signed an agreement with the state of Michigan to pilot its retrofit technology on the state’s roads, Governor Gretchen Whitmer <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90640-512960--,00.html">announced </a>Thursday. The six-month program will see Mobileye’s advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) installed on some 100 vehicles that will test the technology under ice and snow conditions in several counties. Mobileye will collaborate with the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and its mobility initiative PlanetM for the pilot.</p>
      <p>The agreement was announced during Whitemer’s five-day trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The governor arrived in Israel Sunday as part of an economic delegation hosted by the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit in coordination with the MEDC and the Michigan Israel Business Accelerator. This is her first trade mission outside the U.S. In June, PlanetM announced a partnership with the Michigan Israel Business Accelerator and the Israel Innovation Authority to launch the Israel Michigan Autonomous Technologies Collaboration (IMATC). The Detroit area is considered the birthplace of the U.S. automotive industry.</p>
