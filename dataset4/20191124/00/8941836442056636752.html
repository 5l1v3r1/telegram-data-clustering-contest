      <p>NEW DELHI (AP) - More than 1,000 members of the LGBTQ community and their supporters have marched through New Delhi to celebrate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>’s sexual diversity, which they say is progressing but still has a long way to go to become a more accepting place for them.</p>
      <p>Carrying rainbow flags, balloons and placards and dancing to the beat of drums, they demanded self-identification in any gender for legal recognition rather than first registering as a transgender and then providing proof of surgery to authorities, as suggested by a government bill.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>They say the bill, yet to be approved by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>’s Parliament, contradicts a landmark judgment by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>’s top court last year striking down a colonial-era law that made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>
