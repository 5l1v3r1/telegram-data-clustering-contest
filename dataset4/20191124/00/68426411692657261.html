      <h1>Developers are throwing cash at new high-rises – and not just in Toronto and Vancouver</h1>

      <p>Canadian developers are making record investments in new high-rise developments while turning away from detached homes, a shift that is not exclusive to larger markets where affordability concerns have persisted for years.</p>
      <p>Over the last year, a monthly average of $2.9-billion has been invested in new construction of multiple-unit dwellings, according to Statistics Canada data. That is the highest in comparable data since 2010. The apartment segment – which includes both purpose-built rental units and condominiums – accounts for the majority of investment.</p>
      <p>By comparison, a monthly average of $1.9-billion has been spent on the construction of new single-unit dwellings, which include detached homes and cottages. The result is an ever-widening gap in favour of high-rise buildings that reflects a move toward comparatively cheaper living arrangements, whether for renting or ownership.</p>
      <p>“It’s basically millennials, migrants and baby boomers looking for the last affordable piece of housing,” said Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, economist at Bank of Montreal, in explaining why developers have embraced multi-unit construction.</p>
      <p>Over the 12 month period ending with September, British Columbia saw $9.9-billion invested in new multi-unit construction, compared with $4.4-billion for single-unit dwellings, the largest gap among the provinces. (Statscan figures for new construction investment are not adjusted for seasonality or inflation.) Next highest is Quebec, with a $4.4-billion gap in favour of multi-unit housing.</p>
      <p>At the metro level, Toronto and Vancouver have seen billions invested in high-rise living options in recent years. This is hardly surprising given how expensive detached homes remain in both regions, despite a recent patch of instability, along with a need for more apartment buildings.</p>
      <p>However, it’s not just Canada’s priciest markets that are building vertically.</p>
      <p>In Halifax, $494-million has been invested in new multi-unit construction over the past year, which is roughly double of what was invested in detached homes. In 2010, single units had an $80-million advantage.</p>
      <p>An abrupt shift has occurred in the Niagara region. In 2016, about $460-million was invested in building detached homes, or nearly triple the multiunit segment. Over the past 12 months, multi-unit dwellings have a $50-million advantage, with strength in both apartments and row houses.</p>
      <p>Similar reversals are found across the country, including in the metro areas of Calgary, Winnipeg, Barrie and Guelph in Ontario, and Abbotsford-Mission and Kelowna in B.C.</p>
      <p>Statscan’s investment data do not say whether multi-unit investment is being driven by the rental or ownership markets. However, there are clear signs of mounting interest in purpose-built rental construction. For one, there were nearly 50,000 rental-unit starts in 2018, or close to double the previous 10-year average, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.</p>
      <p>Given low vacancies and rising rents in many markets, rental buildings have become an increasingly popular asset class. Investors spent a record $8.38-billion buying Canadian apartment buildings in 2018, according to a report from commercial real estate firm CBRE Canada. Through the first half of 2019, another $4-billion was spent.</p>
      <p>Investment in detached homes is not entirely dead, however. Total investment in single-unit buildings – which, in addition to new construction, includes renovations and conversions – was $5.4-billion in September on a seasonally adjusted basis, or slightly higher than for multiunit buildings. (Detached homes attract considerably more money for renovations.)</p>
      <p>However, what was a $2-billion gap only four years ago has entirely closed, as developers have shifted their spending, and the appetite for multiunit housing shows little sign of abating.</p>
      <p>"I think it will be pretty entrenched for a while,” said Ms. Thiagamoorthy.</p>
