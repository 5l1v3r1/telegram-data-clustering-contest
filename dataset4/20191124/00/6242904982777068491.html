        <b>Kwadwo Asamoah and his Inter Milan teammates have been given bedroom advice by head coach Antonio Conte to stay fit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conte does not want his players to expend too much energy.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old is demanding high fitness levels from his squad as they push for honours.</p>
      <p>He told L'Equipe magazine: "During spells of matches the players should not have sexual relations that last for long periods.</p>
      <p>"They need to make as little effort as possible. The best position for them is if their partners go on top.</p>
      <p>"And it is preferable that they are with their own wives.</p>
      <p>"That way they are not obliged to put in an exceptional performance."</p>
      <p>Inter Milan beat Torino 3-0 on Saturday to stay one point behind leaders Juventus.</p>
