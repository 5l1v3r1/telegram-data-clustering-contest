      <p>Disney+ has nearly won the short-term streaming wars by introducing a one-stop-shop for all things Disney, Marvel and Pixar. And with <i>The Mandalorian,</i> the popularity is only growing week by week as each episode drops and many of the service’s 10-million (and growing) subscribers lean in to heavy viewing as the holidays approach.But how does <i>The Mandalorian</i> square up against demand for similar sci-fi, fantastical programming such as Stranger Things, Dr. Who and Westworld? Turns out that, adjusting for seven days on the market, <i>The Mandalorian</i> is clearly pulling into first place here.</p>
      <p>Parrot Analytics, which is a leader in data research for television and streaming entities, has the information. Here’s what they found seven days out from the initial launch of several series, also including CBS All Access’ <i>Star Trek: Discovery</i>.</p>
      <p>Seven days out from its season 1 launch, demand for Disney+’s <i>The Mandalorian </i>in the United States is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>298% ahead of CBS All Access’ <i>Star Trek: Discovery</i> on the 7th day after its Season 2 debut</li>
        <li>175% ahead of HBO’s <i>Westworld</i> on the 7th day after its Season 2 debut</li>
        <li>72.3% ahead of BBC’s <i>Doctor Who</i> on the 7th day after its Series 11 debut</li>
        <li>69.8% ahead of Netflix's <i>Stranger Things</i> on the 7th day after its Season 2 debut</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are also stats for numbers four days out from release, compared to other, similarly-anticipated, popular series on services available from Amazon Prime to Netflix.</p>
      <p>“Four days out from their respective launch dates, US demand for <i>The Mandalorian</i> was:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>58.7% ahead of Amazon Prime Video's <i>Good Omens</i></li>
        <li>35.8% ahead of Netflix's <i>The Umbrella Academy</i></li>
        <li>15% ahead of Netflix's <i>When They See Us</i></li>
        <li>11.5% ahead of Netflix's <i>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>New episodes drop weekly - as opposed to other streamers, which drop entire seasons at one time - and experts believe the numbers that place<i> the Mandalorian</i> ahead of the crowd will only grow. Of course, the larger question is whether Disney+ can sustain this type of growth over the long run. But knowing Disney, the answer is very likely: Yes.</p>
