        <b>Dean Henderson has all the attributes to be a future Manchester United goalkeeper, according to boss Ole Gunnar Solskajer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has backed goalkeeper <b>Dean Henderson</b> to carve out a successful career at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old played a <b>starring role in Sheffield United's promotion</b> to the Premier League last season and has featured in all 12 top-flight games for the Blades so far this campaign, conceding just nine goals.</p>
      <p>He will miss Sunday's clash with United at Bramall Lane as he is <b>not eligible to play against his parent club</b>.</p>
      <p>Henderson is yet to play a first-team game for the Red Devils but Solskjaer has <b>no doubt he will enjoy a fruitful career</b> with the 20-time English champions.</p>
      <p>"Sheffield United and Chris Wilder have had a big impact on him because he's learning, he's growing as a human being and as a player," he told United's official website.</p>
      <p>"<b>He'll come back one day and will have a good career at United."</b></p>

      <p>Solskjaer says he has been impressed with how comfortably Wilder's side have taken to life in the Premier League and <b>reserved special praise for former United youth player Oliver Norwood</b>, who has been an ever-present for the Blades this season.</p>
      <p>"It's a fantastic achievement what they've done," he added.</p>
      <p>"Chris is a fantastic manager. He's a little bit different than some of us and we had him here for a behind-closed-doors game in August or September, where he played the ones who hadn't played. <b>I'm so happy for him to do well. </b></p>
      <p>"To see Ollie Norwood - I had him in the reserves - captaining a Premier League club is great. It's testament to us as a club as well that if you don't make it at Man United you can still have a great career and Oliver has done fantastic."</p>
