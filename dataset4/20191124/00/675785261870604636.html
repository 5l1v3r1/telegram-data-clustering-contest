      <h2>Habeel Khan, who works for Asda, rushed to save the baby from the home near Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, because the 26-year-old said it was just his "natural instinct"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:55:51+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>A hero <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/asda">Asda</a> home delivery driver rescued a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newborn-baby">newborn baby</a> from a devastating <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/house-fires">house fire</a> .</p>
      <p>Habeel Khan, 26, saw the blaze on his normal delivery rounds so rushed inside the property.</p>
      <p>He helped save the seven-week-old tot and get out of the property near Stapleford, Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>The fire started in the kitchen and spread quickly, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/asda-worker-describes-how-helped-3570458">Nottinghamshire Live</a> says.</p>
      <p>"It was a just a normal day at work for me," modest Habeel said.</p>
      <p>"I was doing my deliveries in the Stapleford area and when I pulled up and looked over to where the customer's house was I saw loads of smoke just gushing out of a house.</p>

      <p>"My natural instinct was to just run across to the house. I could see loads of smoke and lots of people panicking outside.</p>
      <p>"I shouted 'is everyone out of the house?' and that's when a woman with two young children shouted 'my baby; my baby's still in the house.'"</p>
      <p>"I don't think she had realised until then and then she ran back into the house and I went with her.</p>
      <p>"She managed to pick up the baby from a room next to the kitchen where the fire had started, then we ran out."</p>
      <p>Despite his modesty, brave Habeel, who works at the Asda Home Shopping Centre in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, was recently named Colleagues' Colleague of the Year at the Being Asda Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>He has also been praised for his actions.</p>

      <p>"I didn't really think anything of it â€“ I just thought I'd helped out, and had done a little good deed," the employee added.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I have done anything heroic at all to be honest. Thankfully everyone was okay in the end and the family are back in the house."</p>
      <p>Habeel's manager Peter Smith said: "We know him as Smiler. He is always happy. He is always doing the right thing by the customer. He is an absolute asset to the team and a credit to the company."</p>
      <p>Asda's senior vice president of operations Anthony Hemmerdinger said: "What Habeel did was remarkable and it's not something we would recommend that our colleagues do, however it's clear that in this instance his instinct kicked in and he did a remarkable job."</p>
