      <p>This seems to be the format that we’re working with here in <i>Fortnite: Chapter 2</i>. We haven’t had any “search gnomes” sorts of challenges, but we’ve had a couple that have you visiting a list of three things, and that’s what we’re working with this week. It makes a kind of sense: the season is still about exploration, and so we’re not quite ready for hidden object hunts. It’s still time for the game to introduce us to the new locations that will soon become favorite haunts, and that’s what these challenges are all about. One such challenge has shown up here in the “Trick Shot” missions, so here’s a map, guide and location for where to dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman and the Timber Tent. We’re covering good distance on these, so you’d be hard pressed to snag them all in one match. Not tat you need to, of course, but sometimes one likes the additional challenge. Here’s where you’re dropping:</p>

      <p>In the center-east of the map we’ve got the Hayman, easily the toughest one to miss out of the bunch. He’s large, in-charge, jolly and waving, taking up residence in the southwest of Frenzy Farm:</p>

      <p>And then we’ve got the Pipeman: a more contemplative, calm creature, sitting on the southern edge of the map and staring out at the water, with a chest in his head that no doubt holds some sort of essential truth that he has figured out in his long repose. Or a SCAR!</p>

      <p>And then the Timber Tent. Sort of off-theme! Looks like a bonfire about to happen, though it’s fairly short on kindling. Regardless it’s sort of in the center-West of the map, north of Holy Hedges and big enough that it’s hard to miss:</p>

      <p>And that will do you: visit all locations to complete this part of the challenge and find yourself more in-tune with this new map. We’re nearing the end of Chapter 2 now, or at least the end of Chapter 2’s missions: the thing has been extended to February, so I’m hoping that we get a bit more plot going on sometime in the first two months of the new year, or it’s going to be a long break.</p>
