        <b>Canon has unveiled its Black Friday 2019 week deals, which include a number of high-end cameras, on its own website. This store also offers discounts on some lenses, as does Amazon at present. These listings also include Tamron or Sigma attachments.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Motorola-s-Black-Friday-deals-bring-even-more-value-to-smartphone-buyers.442722.0.html">Black Friday</a> 2019 is nearly upon us; however, many brands and stores have taken the initiative and brought their corresponding sales events forward this year. <a href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog">Canon US</a> is one of them: the premium camera brand has already posted a page of deals for the week in question. They include a number of high-end DSLRs, the most discounted of which is the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-EOS-Ra-The-camera-for-astrophotographers-is-now-available-to-purchase.443190.0.html">EOS</a> R, which is being sold with an <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-launches-2-groundbreaking-additions-to-the-RF-line-of-lenses.440414.0.html">RF</a> 24–105mm F4 L IS USM lens to match it.</p>
      <p>This bundle normally goes for $3399, but is down <a href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog">to $2499</a> for Black Friday week. Alternatively, the 30.4MP <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-is-now-allegedly-linked-to-an-upcoming-63MP-sensor.418835.0.html">EOS 5D</a> Mark IV (camera body only) is going for $600 less than its normal price of $3099. Those looking for something else could look to the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-releases-the-EOS-90D-a-new-32MP-crop-DSLR.433601.0.html">EOS 90D</a>, which is currently $1449 rather than its normal 1599. However, pre-existing owners of this camera may be interested in $400 off an <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-tackles-smartphones-that-encroach-on-photography-with-the-new-EOS-M200.435514.0.html">EF</a> 100-400mm F4.5-5.6L IS II USM lens to add telephone capability to their unit.</p>
      <p>Those interested in a more complete package of a gift for themselves or someone else could also consider the  <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-updates-its-EOS-Rebel-compact-DSLR-camera-line-with-APS-C-an-LCD-touchscreen-and-4K.416167.0.html">EOS Rebel</a> T6 <a href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog">Double Zoom Lens Kit</a>. This bundle comes with the camera in question, as well as 2 extended lenses: the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II and the EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III. It also includes a shoulder bag, battery pack, charger, cable and a strap for the EOS Rebel variant in question.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, Amazon has listed some deals on third-party lenses for cameras such as these. They include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sigma&amp;rh=n%3A562261011&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss">$200 off</a> a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/SIGMA-fp-The-world-s-smallest-and-lightest-full-frame-mirrorless-digital-camera.427415.0.html">Sigma</a> 35mm F1.4 Art DG HSM for this brand. In addition, the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-Sony-E-mount-lenses-from-Tamron-are-on-the-way.435129.0.html">Tamron</a> SP 70-200mm F/2.8 Di VC G2 for <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nikon-evokes-a-58mm-classic-with-its-fastest-NIKKOR-lens-ever.438990.0.html">Nikon</a> FX-mounted and Canon EF-mounted units are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Tamron&amp;i=photo&amp;rh=n%3A562261011&amp;page=2&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;linkId=be9c10e8f8727f52b83abbe582be2a96&amp;qid=1574601847&amp;ref=sr_pg_2">$100 off</a> at present. These prices may not last long, however. In addition, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Canon-announced-EOS-1DX-Mk-III-pro-DSLR-camera-4K60p-16fps-burst-shots-and-more.440278.0.html">Canon</a> US is offering free shipping and returns at its store until December 31, 2019.</p>
