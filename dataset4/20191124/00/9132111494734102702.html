      <p>Private Legal practitioner, Maurice Ampaw has observed that government and security agencies are treating the Western Togoland secessionists with kid gloves.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that the Homeland Study Group led by Charles Komi Kudzordzi affectionately called Papavi Kudzordzi has gained the notoriety in engaging in the latest acts because the security agencies are refusing to handle the situation well.</p>
      <p>“I blame President Akufo-Addo and his government, the Minister of Defense, Foreign Affairs Minister and the Attorney General should also share the blame. If the security agencies had dealt well with the leader of the group, he would not have had the nerves to go declaring independence for Western Togoland”, he disclosed on Kumasi-based Otec Fm monitored by MyNewsGh.com.</p>
      <p>Explaining his assertion Mr. Ampaw indicated that the current administration has failed to deal with the situation head on and he is extremely worried that the government's political opponents may make mincemeat out of it.</p>
      <p>“You arrested them and freed them so they have been emboldened. They are of the view that nothing can happen to them. If they succeed they are taking some resources from the country and I would ask government to attach seriousness to the matter”, he stated.</p>
