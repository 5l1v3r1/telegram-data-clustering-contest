      <p>ISLAMABAD: Foreign Office spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal on Sunday said people of Pakistan and the government would carry forward the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), projects for prosperity of the region.</p>
      <p>The CPEC was a colossal engine for generating employment, alleviation of poverty and betterment of economy, he stated while talking to a private news channel programme.</p>
      <p>In reply to a question about reservations of the United States over the project, he said Pakistan would never become the part of economic wars of two global powers.</p>
      <p>He said the entire nation would contribute in the development process of CPEC.</p>
      <p>"We will not move back regarding CPEC at any cost," Dr Muhammad Faisal stated.</p>
      <p>To another question about South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), he said India was the main hurdle in conducting the summit.</p>
      <p>He said without the cooperation and interest of the neighboring country, the objectives of the organization could not be achieved.</p>
      <p>Nearly 1.6 billion people were living in the South Asian region, he said, adding most of the masses were facing poverty.</p>
      <p>He was of the view that India should take interest for vitalizing the SAARC summit so that issues of the region could be addressed in a proper manner.</p>
