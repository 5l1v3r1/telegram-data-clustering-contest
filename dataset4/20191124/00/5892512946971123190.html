      <h1>Time check! Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz 2 main event will start live on FOX PPV around midnight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Undefeated heavyweight sensation Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KO) is set to defend his WBC title later tonight (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) live on FOX PPV from inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, against veteran contender Luis Ortiz (31-1, 26 KO).</p>
      <p>This is one of the biggest matchups of the year for boxing as Wilder and Ortiz turned in an instant classic last year in Brooklyn, New York. Wilder ended up winning that fight via 10th-round TKO, but had trouble with Ortiz's technical approach.</p>
      <p>Leading into the reboot, both heavyweights have much to gain. Wilder has the chance to get another win over Ortiz and set up a rematch with Tyson Fury sometime next year. For Ortiz, this is his chance to exact revenge and score the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/3/25/18280853/boxing-heavyweight-big-three-tyson-fury-deontay-wilder-anthony-joshua">next big upset in heavyweight boxing</a>.</p>
      <p>But when exactly can fight fans expect “Bronze Bomber” and Ortiz to step inside of the ring for their anticipated rematch?</p>
      <p>Boxing is always tricky to time given the lengthy in-event promotions and introductions, but Wilder and Ortiz should begin their respective walks to the ring sometime around midnight 12:00 a.m. ET (subject to change so keep it tuned into Mania for any updates). That will be right after WBA featherweight champion Leo Santa Cruz takes on Miguel Flores for the vacant WBA super featherweight title in the co-main event.</p>
      <p>Make sure you don’t miss the action as Wilder tries to solidify his ranking as boxing’s best heavyweight and create even more hype around his potential rematch with Fury.</p>
