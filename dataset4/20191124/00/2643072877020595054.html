      <h1>Biafra: Nnamdi Kanu Reveals Those That Started Hate Speech In Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>The Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/24/biafra-nnamdi-kanu-to-speak-on-hate-speech-bill-allen-onyemas-fraud-case-today-see-time/"><u><b>Nnamdi Kanu</b></u></a>, has accused the late Sarduana of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello, of originating hate speech in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Recall that in a bid to curb the incidence and<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/01/nigeria-59-buhari-vows-to-take-drastic-action-against-hate-speech/"><u><b> defamation of character</b></u></a> by some anxious media users in the country, former Senate spokesperson, Sabi Abdullahi had reintroduced the ‘Hate Speech’ Bill at plenary.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that the bill has scaled through the first and second reading.</p>
      <p>The Bill is titled: <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/hate-speech-bill-scales-first-reading-at-nigerian-senate/"><u>“National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speeches (Establishment, etc) Bill, 2019”</u></a>.</b></p>
      <p>The bill states that any person who violates the law shall be liable to life imprisonment and where the act causes any loss of life, the person shall be punished with death by hanging.</p>
      <p>Nnamdi Kanu, through a statement by IPOB’s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, claimed that Bello and the people of the Fulani extraction were the first to experiment hate speech against non-Muslims.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“Sir Ahmadu Bello the preliterate Fulani Caliphate feudal lord with his primitive xenophobic tendencies was and still remains the undisputed progenitor of hate speech and irredeemable hater of non-Muslim ethnic groups in the disastrous British colonial experiment known as Nigeria.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Fulani were the first to utilise hate speech to advance their domination of the political space in Nigeria, but today they want to stifle debate and criticism. I suggest this fact guide the thinking of Almajiri lawmakers sponsoring this bill.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Some inhabitants of the abominable damnation, especially those from the south- with their warped and misguided sense of patriotism, still accommodate the obnoxious and downright ignorant views of the Janjaweed unity begging desert-dwelling cow loving reprobates. Britain must close their African Zoo to help put the animals that inhabit it out of their collective misery and hopelessness.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Here is undisguised and raw hatred from core Arewa North as represented by Sir Ahamdu Bello in this BBC interview. Are these the type of hypocrites you want to share the same country with? Heaven forbid!”</i>
