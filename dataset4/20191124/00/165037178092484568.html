        <b>The Belgian, Eden Hazard, revealed (two days before Real Madrid take on PSG in the Champions League) who are his favourite footballers that deserve to win the Ballon d'Or this year. For him, any Liverpool player deserves it a lot more than Messi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hazard also demanded the return of his team-mate <b>Karim Benzema </b>to the French national team. "I can only judge him by his performances, the rest is the French's problem," he started saying in this respect.</p>
      <p><b>"It is not normal that they haven't named Karim in the squad</b> because he is the best striker at the moment. He scores, he plays at the best club in the world. <b>France is already strong without Karim </b>but with him they would be even stronger".</p>

      <p><b>Hazard</b> would not give the<b> Ballon d'Or</b> to Barcelona player, <b>Leo Messi</b> because he thinks that "a<b> Liverpool</b> player" deserves it. His candidates would be <b>Mane, Salah </b>and<b> Van Dijk.</b></p>
      <p>"If <b>Sadio</b> had won the<b> African Cup</b> it wouldn't be a debate and <b>Salah</b> is also my friend", <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-hazard-21292">Eden Hazard</a> explained, in a long interview with 'Le Parisien', in which <b>he also spoke for a long time about Kylian Mbappe</b>, who for him, could also be a future Ballon d'Or winner.</p>
