      <h1>March eyed for start of hospital build</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Guy%20Williams" target="_blank">Guy Williams</a></address>
      <p>The developer of an independent surgical hospital next to the Queenstown Country Club hopes to start construction in March.</p>
      <p>Sanderson Group chairman Fraser Sanderson says he hopes a resource consent variation to build the $20 million facility, filed in August, will be approved by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The project was at the final design stage, and working drawings were being produced.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s working flat out on it at the moment.</p>
      <p>“We’re very confident. The mayor, the council and the community want this hospital … it’ll be an amazing facility.”</p>
      <p>The single-level hospital will be built just south of the retirement village, overlooking Shotover Country, on a site originally consented for the village’s gym and swimming pool.</p>
      <p>When it’s completed – expected to be in late 2021 – Sanderson Group will lease the hospital to joint venture partners Southern Cross Hospitals and Central Lakes Trust.</p>
      <p>Southern Cross will manage the facility, and offer elective surgical procedures expected to include endoscopy, general surgery, gynaecology, dental, orthopaedic, urology, plastic surgery and ear, nose and throat.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a group of bigwigs led by Health Minister David Clark turned up for tea and cakes at the official opening of the $9.3m upgrade of Lakes District Hospital last Friday.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited upgrade means the public hospital now boasts a new emergency department, CT scanner, waiting area, triage and consulting areas, a medical students’ training room, plaster bay and decontamination area, as well as new heating and cooling systems.</p>
