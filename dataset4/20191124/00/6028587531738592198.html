      <p>I didn’t really know what to make of <i>The Mandalorian</i> arriving <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/15/why-are-we-getting-short-27-minute-episodes-of-the-mandalorian-on-disney-plus/#877f6b26339f">with episodes</a> ranging in length from 27-35 minutes in its opening week, with its third episode clocking in at around 32 minutes instead. It’s a wild departure from the 42 minute runtime of most network dramas, and the usual 50-60 minute runtime of high profile streaming service shows.At first, my reaction, along with many others, was that this was bad because ultimately, this meant less bang for our buck. With an eight episode first season of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, we thought that meant eight hours of content, but now that’s looking more like four. Less = worse, right?</p>
      <p>Well, not so much. And the more of these short, tight <i>Mandalorian</i> episodes I see, the more I wish that other programs might consider at least <i>experimenting</i> in this format in this era of what I’ll call “streaming bloat.”</p>
      <p>You’re seeing it more and more these days, as the runtime for shows has evolved from closer to 40 minutes to pretty much an entire hour. But the two options for dramatic offerings are usually something like 20+ 40 minute episodes for network shows per season, or 10-13 hour-long episodes for streaming offerings in places like Netflix or Hulu. That’s why <i>The Mandalorian</i>’s half-hour episodes have been so out of the ordinary. We really almost never see this in dramas, particularly not for a show this high profile.</p>

      <p>And yet, it works. All three episodes have been great, and the short runtime makes them feel like no moment is wasted. I would say this is <i>not</i> true for many hour-long streaming shows or 20+ episode season of network shows where they are either filming more content than they need to pad out a yearly schedule, or in the case of streaming shows, with no commercials to be beholden to, they can leave a lot less on the cutting room floor than they would be otherwise.</p>
      <p>But the result ends up being many series that feel like they overstay their welcome. The extreme examples were the final season <i>Game of Thrones</i> episodes which threw all pretense aside and more or less became an entire weekly movie, to mixed results. Or you have shows like <i>Ozark</i> or <i>Handmaid’s Tale</i> or <i>Stranger Things</i> that are good, yet often seem far longer than they need to be with 50 minutes serving as something of a mandatory minimum for length.</p>
      <p>Jon Favreau asked Disney for the opposite when writing <i>The Mandalorian</i>, and they told him they would have no minimum episode length requirement. I have a hunch part of this may be cost-saving, as you are certainly spending a lot less money on a 27 minute episode in most instances than you are on a 60 minute episode, but it also works for the narrative. <i>The Mandalorian</i> is a show with limited characters and dialogue, and it probably wouldn’t have these mini-arcs work as well if it was stretched into an entire hour each week. The length works for the type of story being told here. It also has the side benefit of being simply less to consume in this era of So Much Content to watch on TV every single week for new releases or weekend for giant binge drops. It literally takes half the time to keep up with as most series.</p>
      <p>I’m not saying 30 minute episodes should be the new norm for all dramas. Many benefit from a runtime longer, or sometimes much longer than that. I’m just saying we almost <i>never</i> see big shows experiment with shorter episodes, and that length is usually relegated to comedies. <i>The Mandalorian</i> is breaking those boundaries, and I have to wonder if this may become a “Disney Plus thing” with other big Marvel or Star Wars shows doing the same.</p>
      <p>Yes, I am still sad that we will have to wait an entire year at least for more <i>Mandalorian</i> after just 4 hours of footage, but I mean, four hours is still the length of two <i>Star Wars</i> movies, and if it’s good, I don’t need it to double in size just to fill some arbitrary quota.</p>
      <p>I think this is an interesting experiment in storytelling in the current streaming landscape, and I will be curious to see what follows in <i>The Mandalorian</i>’s footsteps here, whether that’s on Disney or somewhere else.</p>
