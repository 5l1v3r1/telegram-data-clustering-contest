      <p>Since the 90’s, mobile phones have come a long way, and to some Ghanaians, only the rich and privileged back then owned these mobile devices.</p>
      <p>From the Motorola MicroTAC mobile phone, to the Nokia 3310, Samsung SGH-T100, Nokia N-Gage, BlackBerry 5810, amongst others.</p>
      <p>GhanaWeb takes a look at some of these devices, when mobile phones started to gravitate towards more slim line designs, with affordable prices.</p>
      <p>Nostalgia, prepare for it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Motorola MicroTAC 9800X</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 1988, the Motorola MicroTAC had a pretty long shelf life when it was first introduced but then went through a few changes that moved it from an analogue phone to a GDM-compatible handset in 1994.</p>
      <p>It was eventually succeeded by Motorola’s StarTAC in 1996, which was one of the first ‘true’ mobile-capable phones ever released.</p>
      <p>Motorola reportedly sold about 60 million units of the StarTac.</p>

      <p>The very popular Nokia 6110 phone was the first mobile phone to use an ARM processor, and was just one of a long line of 6xxx series phones from the Finnish mobile manufacturing company, Nokia.</p>
      <p>With excellent battery life, the 1998 Nokia 5110 became the standard for most Communication Centre business that operated in Ghana at the time.</p>
      <p>It became the first device to run the legendary Snake game, Logic and featured the Calculator, Clock and Calendar Currency converter.</p>
      <p>It was from the 6110’s popularity, that Nokia decided to include Snake in the majority of their phones and future sequels of Snake.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Before Samsung took over the world it made handsets like the Samsung SGH-T100, which was the first phone ever to use a thin-film transistor active-matrix LCD display.</p>

      <p>The Nokia 3310 in the 90s became the phone that many Ghanaians had to own – with a very lasting battery life and an array of ringtones, the Nokia 3310 was regarded as one of the best mobile devices ever created. Till date, some even say it’s indestructible.</p>
      <p>

      <p>The BlackBerry 5810 was the first BlackBerry phone released by RIM and the first BlackBerry OS 3.6 device.</p>
      <p>The phone was released in 2002 and needed a headset to call people with because it didn't have a speaker built in so users had to plug headphones in to make phone calls, but the BlackBerry 5810 did have email and a QWERTY keyboard.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nokia N-GAGE</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Nokia N-GAGE was the first ever “gaming phone”. It ran on Symbian and featured a rather unique design, whereby the keys were set out on the side of the display.</p>
      <p>The phone was designed in an attempt to lure away gamers from Nintendo’s Game Boy Advanced. The handset also included support for apps and also MP3, making it a true smartphone in every sense of the word.</p>
      <p>On sale between 2003 and 2005, it was reported that Nokia sold about three million units of this device.</p>
      <p>
