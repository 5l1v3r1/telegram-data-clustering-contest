      <p>CAIRO - 24 November 2019: Speaker of the House of Representatives Ali Abdel Aal confirmed on Sunday that the current legislative term ends in January 2021 and the next legislative elections will be held in November 2020. <br/><br/>Abdel Aal also stressed in his speech during the Parliament sessions that in the coming days a number of actions will be taken against the sentenced corrupt members. <br/><br/>The speaker clarified that refraining from allocating 5 percent of the seats to persons with disabilities contradicts with the Constitution and the law, and referred that some ministers were not performing properly. <br/><br/>Commenting on the Legislative Committee's rejection of the Public Taste Law, Abdel-Aal stated that not every idea put forward should become a law, explaining the impossibility to control the public taste as it varies according to time and place and that any tampering with the behavior of the Egyptian street is a criminal act.</p>
