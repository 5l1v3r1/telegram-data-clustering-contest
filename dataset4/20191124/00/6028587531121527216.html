      <p>I was really taken with a story this week that was contributed to my company’s Instagram account, it drew comparison between neurodiversity inclusion (or lack thereof) and racial segregation. This lady was recalling conversations in which teachers had suggested that her son’s neurodiversity would be a problem for the other students.</p>
      <p>“I substitute in my thoughts” she said “whether this would be okay if we changed the subject to race. How black is your son? Does he at least act white enough most of the time, or does he need to be separated?” Wow, I thought. Sounds strong, but she’s kind of got a point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Acknowledging Prejudice</b>
      </p>
      <p>The fight against racism is undeniably still a current and pressing issue in the world, yet we have reached a level of awareness where most people would understand that they should not ask a person of color if they could behave “white enough” to fit in at work. If they did they would most likely lose their job, and rightly so!</p>
      <p>The same is not true for ableism. Many people have never even heard the term and are unaware that they use ableist language and adhere to ableist principles all the time. It is one of the last “isms” that is still widely socially acceptable.</p>
      <p>Neurodiversity traits are biological but are treated by many as moral character deficits.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It’s Not A Choice</b>
      </p>
      <p>A different standard exists for ableism, one that we also see with homophobia. People tend to assume that these differences are choices and can be changed through therapy or hard work.</p>
      <p>Now, to be very clear, I am not saying that we have nailed it on race and gender inclusion yet, because the statistics tell a different story. Recent news about <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-might-hold-another-workout-and-heres-his-plan-to-get-nfl-owners-to-attend/">Colin Kaepernick’s exclusion from NFL</a>, for example, reminds us how racism is still active, yet it is estimated he has added <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nikes-value-is-up-262-b-since-colin-kaepernick-endorsement-now-its-close-to-unveiling-his-shoe-150012824.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACuwRM3Eq2hBEl7YoqfAHKdDmcZUmVzyI5kOGYxjZUGQo5pUqBAtMaSMWGxUqWVyCbqj2swQQiJrFPC41Ap3L3a2PmTfHAkiWnNVXfbdJVpmQvMMkkldtUVrLcusILIL7flOU3QhGrxcHhbGic4V4fguLMgI8VPaK8YBR73BzOjU">billions to Nike sales</a> as their ambassador without anyone requiring him to be “more white” in order to do so. It is accepted that biologically speaking he is who he is and that cannot be changed. Of course we must not disregard the way in which society still puts pressure on people of color to conform to white cultural norms in order to succeed, but we don’t have bosses suggesting their staff go on “whiteness” training courses to improve their skills!</p>

      <p>I was explaining this particular issue to a colleague today. She has an undiagnosed son who has lots of ADHD traits. He often gets in trouble at school for fidgeting. “You have to try to sit still,” she reported back to him after parent/teaching meetings. “Why does he?” I asked. She looked somewhat incredulous. But at what point did sitting still become so essential? I have a standing desk with a wobble board at work, it helps me to release my ADHD energy whilst working, which in turn, helps me to focus on my task. We should allow kids to move if they need to. It’s unhealthy to sit still all day–he’s right and they are all wrong!</p>
      <p>My client, who finds eye contact painful, was told by her last employer during a stressful meeting, to “look at me so that I know you’re listening.” This is unacceptable (and yes, they are going to court now). This incident really illustrates my point–the colleague believed that my client was making a choice by looking down, choosing to be disrespectful or simply not paying attention. She was not viewing her neuro-differences as legitimate. My client is still somewhat traumatised by that interaction and it will no doubt add to her anxiety in the future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Coaching As An Accommodation</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have a client who has been struggling to avoid sensory meltdowns at work. Her employers have been brilliant–reducing sensory overwhelm in her environment, letting her use the software she needs, providing coaching all of which will help.</p>
      <p>Coaching is a great tool, but let me be 100% clear here, the purpose of the coaching isn’t to make her more neurotypical. </p>
      <p>My job doesn’t revolve around normalizing or teaching people to mask who they are. </p>
      <p>When workplace performance issues are addressed by encouraging neurodiverse people to learn strategies, to “work on themselves” it can make us feel like if we just “tried harder” everything would be fine, and starts a vicious circle of self-reproach.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mastering Our Own Neurodiversity</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good coaching is focused on mastery experiences. Rather than teaching new processes, we start by asking about occasions where you have achieved the desired skill before, or developing understanding about the purpose behind the problem. And then we start picking out the principles of that occasion. What was it about the environment you were in? Were you talking it through first? Mind mapping it? Is there a motivational or values based frame? What are the key ingredients for you personally? Starting with strengths, or what works well, is a solid, evidence-based approach for building self-efficacy. It allows us to create our own strategies and avoid self-reproach. We can apply the process to many work performance areas affected by neurodiversity, and it teaches us to trust ourselves rather than feel dependent on expert advice. Good coaching is about asking questions and noticing themes and patterns, not providing answers.</p>
      <p>To apply this approach to my client who experiences meltdowns, when we coach her it’s not to tell her that meltdowns are bad, or that she needs to fight them, it’s to help her work out the purpose of them. When you go into that “self-protective reflex,” what are you protecting yourself from? (i.e. we are assuming the “meltdown” has a logical purpose). If she finds the triggers, she may have more choice and control. Also, we can co-coach with her supervisor, so that they develop an understanding about how to recover from a meltdown, how to get learn from them and build trust. They can talk about it from their non-panicky states, and agree how to support overwhelm, rather than seeing it as “failure.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>It’s Not Us Who Need To Change</b>
      </p>
      <p>When we tell ADHD-ers to sit still, or autists to look at us, or dyslexics to spell more accurately, it is no different to telling someone with a hearing impairment to listen up, or someone with a mobility issue to walk faster, or a person of color to get their hair relaxed. But most of us wouldn’t dream of doing those things! Neurodiverse brains are different. Autists hear/see/smell/feel more intensely. People with Tourette’s find it exhausting to suppress tics, like trying to stop a sneeze. People with ADHD have less dopamine, which means we never feel satisfied, hence the hyperactivity. Dyspraxics have fewer neurological signals about touch, fine motor control and/or balance. English speaking dyslexics don’t process sound in the same way as non-dyslexics, so connecting the myriad of phonetic rules within English language is difficult.</p>
      <p>Side note: Did you know that Chinese dyslexics have <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2004/040830/full/040830-5.html">a <i>completely </i>different neurological profile</a> because their language is pictorial, not phonetic? English dyslexics could very possibly excel at Chinese and vice versa! But I digress…</p>
      <p>In short, my point is this, no one chooses to be clumsy, restless or different. Workplace accommodations aren’t about changing the person to fit the environment, that’s not legal. It’s about changing the environment and activities to fit the person. Asking us to learn to be more like you isn’t just doomed to failure, it’s actually discrimination.</p>
