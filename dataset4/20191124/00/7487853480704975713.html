      <h1>Arsene Wenger to Discuss Standard of Premier League VAR Use With Referees Boss Mike Riley</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15362714" target="_blank">Gary Stringer</a></address>
      <p>VAR controversies have plagued the 2019/20 Premier League season so far, but improvements could be on the horizon as referees' chief Mike Riley prepares to hold talks with former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman was recently appointed as FIFA's Chief of Global Football development, in addition to his role on the International FA Board's (IFAB) Football and Technical Advisory Panels, and it appears one of his first tasks could be to tackle and improve the usage of video assistant referees in England's top flight.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11868915/arsene-wenger-to-be-consulted-on-var-by-referees-boss-mike-riley">Sky Sports</a> report that Riley, head of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), said at a recent Premier League shareholders' meeting: "Arsene's appointment is a really good opportunity to talk to people and influence them. I have no doubt those conversations will be taking place."</p>
      <p>An IFAB meeting is set to take place in Belfast on 3rd December, with Wenger expected to be in attendance and offering his thoughts on how to improve use of VAR and other laws of the game.</p>
      <p>Despite recent statistics revealing that the accuracy of key decisions has increased by nine percent on 2018/19 levels, the PGMOL has admitted to four decisions being wrongly overturned in 2019/20 so far - all of which involved penalties or goals. Riley has been open about the need for improvement, and calling on Wenger's 22 years of Premier League experience with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">​Arsenal</a> can only help.</p>

      <p>The inconsistency in decision making has not been the only gripe for match-going supporters, with the in-stadium communication of VAR decisions desperately needing improvement in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a>.</p>
      <p>During the same shareholders' meeting, it was announced that more detailed information will be given to fans in attendance from December - although the exact details of this remain unclear.</p>
