        <b>Ah, Black Friday. The day every borderline insane bargain hunter heads to their local electronics store and has an actual fist fight over a television that's been heavily discounted for a reason.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You don’t want to be like them, do you? Of course you don’t. Instead, browse our list of tellies and shop from the safety of your home. Not only are these TVs actually good, but the only person who’ll punch you in the face is yourself when you see the size of your credit card bill.</p>
      <p>Happy shopping!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>If I was to say "you can buy a 65-inch 4K telly for under £500," chances are you'd laugh harder than you have in a good long while. But yet, for this Black Friday, here we are with a massive panel at such a low price. Care about an immersive viewing experience but don't want to break the bank? Toshiba's Smart 4K HDR screen is the way to go.</p>
      <p>Was £599 | Now £499</p>

      </figure>
      <p>LG have quite the reputation for creating impressive TVs at affordable prices. But even with those standards in mind, a 43-inch 4K Smart TV for under £300 is mind-blowing value! HDR 10 keeps those colours vivid and beautiful, while WebOS keeps the whole Smart TV experience nice and streamlined.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Samsung's pairing of its Quantum Processor and QLED display technology is a match made in vividly colourful heaven in this TV. With 100% colour volume, nothing looks washed out in this bright and vivid picture. Plus the HDR10+, smart content discovery features and Bixby smart assistant make this an absolute doddle to use.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The idea of your telly having back lighting that matches the colour of what's on screen can seem a little gimmicky on first glance. But it really comes into its own with a new level of immersion on Philips 50-inch 4K TV. It's one of those features that when you get it, you never switch off ever again!</p>

      <h3>Samsung The Frame (2019) QLED Art Mode TV</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>For too long, the living room has had to fit around the TV. But now, thanks to Samsung's The Frame TV, the telly can just blend into the wall like any picture frame (as the name suggests). This boasts some serious home entertainment specs - 4K resolution, HDR, QLED technology and a near-invisible optical cable to connect all your consoles and TV boxes - while pairing it up with an Art Mode that displays artwork or your own photos when not in use, to really add to any room.</p>
      <p>Normally, this kind of top-of-the-range tech sets you back four figures, but the price has come tumbling down for Black Friday...</p>
      <p>Was £1499 | Now £999</p>

      <p>I see you, dear reader. You may have looked at a couple of these TVs, thinking "it's a good discount for a great telly, but still way out of my price range."
