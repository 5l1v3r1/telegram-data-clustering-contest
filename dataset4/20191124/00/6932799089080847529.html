        <b>Intel has released its latest Next-Unit Computing- (NUC) form-factor PCs. They are powered by 10th-generation Core processors, and have i3, i5 and i7 variants. This applies to the kits and the mini PCs in this series, which also have Thunderbolt 3, Wi-Fi 6 and 4 USB 3.1 ports, 1 of which is type C.</b>

      <p>Intel has made its new line of NUCs <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/boards-kits/nuc/nuc10-performance-kits-mini-pcs-brief.html">official</a>. These diminutive PCs, in accordance with their new product names, integrate ex-<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/10-core-Intel-Comet-Lake-S-desktop-CPUs-spotted-on-Geekbench.443333.0.html">Comet Lake</a> 10th-generation Core <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i3-10110U-Laptop-Processor-Comet-Lake-U.430588.0.html">i3-10110U</a>, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i5-10210U-Laptop-Processor-Comet-Lake-U.430587.0.html">i5-10210U</a> or <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i7-10710U-Laptop-Processor-Comet-Lake-U.430585.0.html">i7-10710U</a> SoCs. These sub-series are called NUC10i3FN, NUC10i5FN and NUC10i7FN respectively. All 3 include kit (NUC10i3FNH/K, NUC10i5FNH/K or NUC10i7FNH/K) and mini-PC (NUC10i3FNHxx, NUC10i5FNHxx, NUC10i5FNKxx, NUC10i7FNKxx or NUC10i7FNHxx) SKUs.</p>
      <p>These new devices would have been heretofore known under the code name <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Frost-Canyon-NUC-leak-indicates-an-incremental-update-over-Bean-Canyon-expected-to-launch-on-December-12.442678.0.html">Frost Canyon</a>. Some of the leaks surrounding this series have proven true: they do indeed have <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Surface-Pro-7-defines-itself-through-power-performance-and-USB-type-C-ports.436787.0.html">USB type C</a>, which is present <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/boards-kits/nuc/nuc10-performance-kits-mini-pcs-brief.html/">on the front</a> of each variant's case. The NUCs 10 Performance also come equipped with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Eurocom-s-Sky-X4C-X7C-laptops-now-integrate-Intel-s-desktop-grade-Core-i9-9900KS-CPUs.442721.0.html">Thunderbolt 3</a>, HDMI 2.0, Bluetooth 5, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-Element-modular-platform-spotted-in-upcoming-Ghost-Canyon-NUCs.440061.0.html">Wi-Fi 6</a> and 3.5mm stereo headphone ports.</p>
      <p>Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/boards-kits/nuc/nuc10-performance-kits-mini-pcs-brief.html">claims that</a> these new home-office, media-managing or casual <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-vs-Xbox-Project-Scarlett-Gaming-performance-is-apparently-better-on-Sony-s-next-generation-console.443861.0.html">gaming</a> PCs have more than twice the performance (albeit compared to a similarly-spec'd 5-year-old laptop) and that their wireless data-transfer rate (conferred as it is by Wi-Fi 6 compared to 802.11ac) has also improved by 3x. They also have the potential to deliver 8 times the bandwidth, thanks to the inclusion of <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-s-15-inch-Matebook-gets-leaked-specs-and-renders.443337.0.html">Thunderbolt</a> rather than USB 3.0. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Simply-NUC-s-Ryzen-powered-Sequoia-doesn-t-have-Intel-inside.443193.0.html">NUC</a> 10 Performance line does not have pricing or availability information as yet.</p>
