      <p>At a time of trade friction between the U.S. and China, the two countries can nevertheless work together to fight cancer-- a common enemy,  Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd said at a symposium in the southern China city of Guangzhou on Sunday.“Bringing the United States and China together to conquer cancer is a timely and notable cause, and a first-class example of common ground and cooperation between the United States and China,” said Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former prime minister of Australia.</p>
      <p>The gathering, known as the “2019 CTONG-MSK Annual Symposium,” was organized by New York-headquartered Memorial Sloan Kettering Memorial Center, the world’s oldest and largest private cancer center, and the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group, an alliance of 20 cancer centers in China.  MSK and CTONG aim to create a platform that can accelerate multi-center clinical trials of cancer medicines; today’s event here in Guangzhou aims at “bringing the United States and China together to conquer cancer.” The Rudd-led Asia Society Policy Institute works to tackle major policy challenges countries the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
      <p>“An important task we have ahead is to develop a task force with representatives in government, industry, academia and philanthropy sectors in the U.S. and China, as well as partnering countries in the Asia-Pacific,” Rudd said. “The aim is to facilitate dialog, harmonize regulatory approval processes and accelerate the development of cancer treatment and prevention strategies in both countries, which in turn benefits the world.”</p>
      <p>Rudd sounded a personal note by saying that his mother died of lung cancer as a non-smoker. More than one million people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, and the majority will die from the disease, he said. One of the focuses of discussion today was lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer deaths in both the U.S. and China. Others included biomarkers in immuno-oncology therapy (see introduction <a href="https://www.immunooncology.com/about/biomarkers">here</a>) and new designs in clinical trials.  The two-day symposium will conclude tomorrow with a "surgery live" section that includes a surgery observation from the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital.</p>
      <p>The worldwide market for cancer drugs is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 12%, tripling over a decade, to $237 billion in 2024, according to research firm Kantar. Market growth is being driven by a mixture of increasing incidence and drug-treated populations and anticipated higher cost of new therapeutics, Kantar says.  Event sponsors include Bristol-Myers Squibb, BeiGene Pharmaceutical, Novartis, Astrazeneca Pharmaceutical, MSD China Holding, and Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine.</p>
      <p>The event is being held against a backdrop of heightened trade and other friction between Washington and Beijing that have included calls on research collaboration between the two sides.</p>
