      <p>At least 14 houses were said to have been burnt and two people injured following an attack on Dan-Anacha Village under Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State, according to a report by PUNCH. </p>
      <p>Local residents said trouble started on Thursday following the directive of Governor Darius Ishaku that the name of the secondary school in the community be changed from Dan-Anacha to Kwararafa.</p>
      <p>Mr Kelvin Katyo of Taraba Tiv Youth Council said that the governor had on November 15, 2019 in a letter through the Executive Secretary, post-School Management Board, directed the name change which did not go down well with the members of the community.</p>
      <p>According to him, pupils of the school, who were not comfortable with the name change staged a protest demanding that the governor revert the decision. </p>
      <p>But they were attacked by irate youths.</p>
      <p>Katyo said, “The Chief of Tiv in Gassol, Zaki Erentsa Simon, had prevailed on the Tiv people in the town to remain calm after the protest. </p>
      <p>"But in the night, some people suspected to be Governor Ishaku’s sympathizers, attacked and burnt 14 houses belonging to the Tiv people in the town.</p>
      <p>“We wonder why the governor is doing what he is doing now. </p>
      <p>"We don’t need a name change now because it will escalate tension in the state.”</p>
      <p>Police Public Relations Officer in the state, David Misal, said he was not aware of the development.</p>
