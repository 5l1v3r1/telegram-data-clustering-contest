      <p>South Korean singer-actress Goo Hara was found dead at her Gangnam home on Nov. 24, according to the Yonhap News Agency. While a police statement said that the cause of her death is still under investigation, it has only been six months since she was hospitalized for an alleged suicide attempt in May. After that attempt, she apologized to her fans for causing a commotion. She was 28. The last year or two have been difficult for the normally vivacious entertainer. In 2018 she had to file a lawsuit against her former boyfriend who was threatening her with a sex tape he filmed without her consent. He was sent to prison for blackmail, filming without consent, and for assaulting her, but the publicity surrounding the case resulted in making her the focus of criticism and online harassment.</p>
      <p>Her Instagram posts in the last year have included messages that shared her pain and fatigue, with honest confessions that she was barely coping emotionally.</p>
      <p>Goo Hara was a member of the k-pop girl group Kara, which was formed by DSP Media in 2007 and disbanded in 2016. She joined the group in 2008.</p>
      <p>After leaving Kara, she worked with Japanese musician, singer-songwriter, Fukuyama Masaharu on the song <i>Magic of Love</i>, which was used as a soundtrack for FujiTV's drama <i>Galileo</i>. Masaharu starred in the TV drama and Goo Hara had a cameo. She was featured in Thunder's 2016 single, <i>Sign</i>, worked on a soundtrack for the drama <i>Jugglers</i>, titled <i>On A Good Day;</i> and in April 2018, hosted the JTBC beauty show <i>My Mad Beauty Diary</i>.</p>
      <p>Although she was primarily a singer, Goo Hara also appeared in a few TV dramas, including <i>City Hunter</i> and <i>Secret Love</i>, with cameos in <i>It’s Okay, That’s Love</i> and <i>Galileo 2</i>, as well as appearing in the web movie <i>Footstep</i>. She participated in the reality show <i>Invincible Youth</i> and served as an emcee on multiple variety shows including <i>Inkigayo</i>.</p>
      <p>She starred in her own reality show <i>On &amp; Off</i> on MBC Music and hosted the KBS' idol beauty show <i>A Style For You</i> along with fellow k-pop stars, Super Junior's Kim Heechul, EXID's Hani and Sistar's Bora.</p>
      <p>Goo Hara’s career looked to be taking a promising new turn in June, when she signed a contract with Production Ogi, a talent management agency in Japan, where she was very popular. This led to her appearance on a few Japanese TV shows and the release of a Japanese single on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>A month ago, her close friend, fellow singer-actress Sulli committed suicide, a loss she felt keenly. Goo Hara’s last Instagram post, shared on Saturday, was a photo her peacefully resting in bed and the words “Good Night.” </p>
