      <h1>Micah Parsons Gives Justin Fields Props On Instagram: “Respect Earned”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:21:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State took down Penn State on Saturday to clinch the Big Ten East, and it looks like the Justin Fields hype train got a new passenger in the process. Nittany Lions star defensive end Micah Parsons was apparently impressed by what he saw from the Buckeyes’ signal-caller.</p>
      <p>Fields, who finished the game 16-of-22 for 188 yards with two touchdowns, took to Instagram after the game to celebrate the victory. Parsons commented on the post.</p>
      <p>“Earned…I salute you…respect earned.”</p>
      <p>Fields also added 68 yards on the ground. He was a problem for Penn State’s defense all day.</p>

      <p>Parsons is a great player in his own right, and it’s likely that he winds up being a top NFL pick after his junior season.</p>
      <p>Ohio State will face either Minnesota or Wisconsin in the Big Ten title game in two weeks. The Buckeyes have their rivalry game with Michigan next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Penn State, meanwhile, will finish up its season against Rutgers. The Nittany Lions will likely finish the year with a 10-2 record.</p>
