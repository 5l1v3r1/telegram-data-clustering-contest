        <b>Richie Stanaway may have driven his final race as a professional driver, the New Zealander contemplating a permanent retirement from the sport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stanaway has no Supercars deal for the 2020 season, left without a drive as Garry Rogers Motorsport exits the category.</p>
      <p>It is the second year in a row he has faced an uncertain future, after a split with Tickford Racing at the end of 2018, one year into what was meant to be a two-year deal.</p>
      <p>With next to no full-time drives left on next year's grid, a potential future for Stanaway in Supercars would likely be through a return to an enduro co-driver role.</p>
      <p>He took to social media after the Newcastle season finale on Sunday to say: "After 23 years of strapping the helmet on I feel like it's time to finally call it a day.</p>
      <p>"I never would have predicted my racing career to be so short and it's not a decision that I've taken lightly but it is what it is.</p>
      <p>"I got further than I could have ever imagined I would &amp;and I can't thank everyone enough that has been a part of the journey. Time to start a new chapter."</p>
      <p>Speaking to Autosport, Stanaway explained: "Honestly, I feel fine about everything.</p>
      <p>"I'm not really sure if I'll race anymore, I'm on the fence. I'm thinking about going cold turkey.</p>
      <p>"It's been on my mind for a while. I don't want to make any decisions yet, I might give it a couple of weeks or a month and then really be int he mood to co-drive or go back into GTs or whatever.</p>
      <p>"But I'm on the fence at the moment with what I do. I'm pretty happy with where I'm at."</p>

      <p>He added that a full-time return to GT racing in Europe is not on the table, Stanaway keen to continue living down under after a lengthy career in Europe which included World Endurance Championship and GP2 campaigns among others.</p>
      <p>When pressed on what he'd do instead of racing, Stanaway said: "Same thing everyone else does with their life - find something else to do. I've got a few ideas..."</p>
      <p>Stanaway marked the likely end of his full-time Supercars career with a 15th place in Newcastle, as he finished 24th and last of the primary drivers in the points, his tally severely dented by missing six races due to injury.</p>
      <p>While there was little in the way of front-running results, Stanaway reckons he made genuine gains in his driving across the season - which were masked by a lack of outright pace in the car.</p>
      <p>"If you look at the results on paper sure it's not great. But for my own personal experience I've still managed to develop myself and push myself to a higher level with these cars.</p>
      <p>"Towards the end of the year I started to get more comfortable with driving the cars on the limit, and then stress levels come down and you get more consistent.</p>
      <p>But nobody would really see that, because we haven't had the car speed to get results.</p>
      <p>"I'm still happy about what we've done, it's been a good experience.</p>
      <p>"It's just unfortunate that in a category like this you need a little bit of luck with the politics and the commercial side of it, and I've had a bad run with that side of it.</p>
      <p>"Last year I basically didn't have a sponsor, and this year the team hasn't seen the benefits of developing the cars - which I actually agree with, because there's no point Garry [Rogers] and Boost [Mobile] spending the same [amount] of money Penske did developing the cars."</p>
