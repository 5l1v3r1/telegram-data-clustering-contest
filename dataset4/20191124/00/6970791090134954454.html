      <p>Back in July, Tay <a href="https://www.sohh.com/breaking-tay-k-sentenced-to-55-years-in-murder-case/">received over 50 years</a> behind bars for his role in a murder case.</p>
      <blockquote>Taymore McIntyre, also known as Tay-K 47, was sentenced to 55 years Tuesday after a Tarrant County jury found the 19-year-old rapper guilty of murder for his part in a 2016 home invasion. He was also ordered to pay a $21,000 fine and sentenced to 30 years and two 13-year sentences to be served concurrently for three counts of aggravated robbery.  (WFAA)</blockquote>
      <p>A few days prior, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/breaking-tay-k-sentenced-to-55-years-in-murder-case/">a jury found</a> Tay-K guilty in a publicized murder case.</p>
      <blockquote>A North Texas jury found teen rapper Taymor McIntyre — also known as Tay-K — guilty of murder Friday morning. Earlier, the jury had asked to see evidence presented when the medical examiner testified about the victim, Ethan Walker. The group took another look at autopsy photos, as well as the single bullet that killed the 21-year-old. Walker was <a href="https://cbsloc.al/2xVsvWW">shot in the stomach</a> after he told McIntyre and a group of other robbers that he didn’t have any drugs or money. (CBS Local)</blockquote>
      <p>The same week, Tay <a href="https://www.sohh.com/breaking-tay-k-sentenced-to-55-years-in-murder-case/">appeared in court</a> and pleaded not guilty to capital murder.</p>
      <blockquote>Tay-K, whose real name is Taymor McIntyre, had pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of aggravated robbery related to two other victims inside the house. But McIntyre pleaded not guilty to capital murder in the death of Ethan Walker, 21, and to another count of aggravated robbery related to the shooting of Beloate. (Star-Telegram)</blockquote>
