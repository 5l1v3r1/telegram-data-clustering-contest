      <p><b>Background</b><br/><br/>The December 17 referendum seeks to amend the law to enable Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) and unit committee members to be elected along political party lines.<br/><br/>However, there seems to be confusion surrounding the referendum and what it actually entails.<br/><br/>An earlier research conducted by the Coalition of Domestic Election Observers (CODEO), indicated that six (6) out of every (10) Ghanaian are unaware of the December 17 elections, let alone what it entails.<br/><br/>Some pundits analysing responses from Ghanaians and a u-turn by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) have called for a suspension of the referendum for consensus to be reached by everyone and for proper education to be made.<br/><br/>The Regional Reorganisation and Development Minister, Dan Botwe has proposed a total withdrawal of the December 17 referendum while Dr. Amoako Baah, a political scientist is calling for a suspension.</p>
