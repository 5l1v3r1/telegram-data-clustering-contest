      <p>Australia are seven wickets away from a perfect start to the test summer and inflicting a demoralising defeat on Pakistan.</p>
      <p>On song with bat and ball, the Aussies are poised to take a 1-0 lead in the two-test series in Brisbane as soon as Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Three years ago at the Gabba, Pakistan almost pulled off the impossible by threatening to chase down a world-record 490 on the last two days.</p>
      <p>But with another 276 runs required just to make Australia bat again and sunny skies predicted for Sunday and Monday, Pakistan would require an even bigger miracle this year.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Starc looks to have re-found his groove with two late wickets on Saturday to reduce Pakistan to 3-64, while Pat Cummins also took one.</p>
      <p>Starc's opening-spell wickets go with his four in the first innings, and come after a difficult Ashes series in which he had been overlooked for all but one test.</p>
      <p>He dismissed captain Azhar Ali lbw on Saturday evening in his second over and nicked off Haris Sohail in his next off another poor shot by the No.3.</p>
      <p>Cummins' wicket also came from an edge, although his ball that angled across Asad Shafiq was much more difficult for the batsman to negotiate.</p>
      <p>"The process here is quite simple," Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne said when asked of Sunday's plans.</p>
      <p>"Keep bashing the wicket - it looks like Nathan (Lyon) is getting some spin out there, especially to the leftie.</p>
      <p>"There's little bit of up and down so, hopefully, we can get a few hitting in the cracks and staying low."</p>
      <p>With the bat, Australia will also be pleased.</p>
      <p>David Warner hit his first century since the ball-tampering ban, while Joe Burns locked himself in as his opening partner.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne looks an answer at No.3, after cracking his first test century on Saturday with a massive 185.</p>
      <p>Matthew Wade also hit a half-century, with Travis Head and Steve Smith the only men in the top six to miss out.</p>
