      <p>The Central Police Command in the Ashanti regional capital, Kumasi has commenced investigations into the missing sidearm of the police bodyguard of Railway Minister, Joe Ghartey.</p>
      <p>The minister and his bodyguard filed a complaint at Adum police station over the stolen weapon which was loaded with 10 rounds ammunition.</p>
      <p>The minister and his bodyguard were in Ashanti region for official duty while they also join some national executives of the party for a funeral of a female activist of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP).</p>
      <p>Police sources say no personal effect of the minister was stolen aside the gun. A senior police officer among the investigation body told Ultimate FM’s Isaac Justice Bediako on condition of anonymity that the police doubt the gun was stolen from the room of the minister through burglary as reported since there is no trace to that effect.</p>
      <p>The source said: “The police suspect the officer misplaced the gun in the hotel which he couldn’t recollect where he placed it, this can’t be burglary’’.</p>
      <p>He, however, assured the general public that a team of investigators have been assigned to investigate the matter including the staff of Georgia hotel who were on duty at the time the gun was allegedly stolen from the facility.</p>
