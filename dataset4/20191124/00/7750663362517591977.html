      <h1>Graeme Jones claims Leeds opener should not have stood</h1>

      <p>Jones believes <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kalvin-phillips/"><b>Kalvin Phillips</b></a> fouled <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/izzy-brown/"><b>Izzy Brown</b></a> in the build-up to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/patrick-bamford/"><b>Patrick Bamford</b></a>'s 51st-minute opener.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-collins/"><b>James Collins</b></a> levelled almost immediately, before Bamford laid claim to Leeds' last-minute winner, the official verdict being an own goal but Bamford claiming he got a touch.</p>
      <p>Jones was unhappy with the opener and also with other decisions during the game.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I'm a biased manager, I think I try to be fair and try to be subjective with things," Jones said.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion, I've looked at the clips back, it's a foul on Izzy, taking his legs from him.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion, it's a penalty on James Collins, he gets the other side and gets kicked and in my opinion, Matty Pearson is onside.</p>
      <p>"We're playing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leeds-united/"><b>Leeds United</b></a>, the gulf is already big enough and when you don't get decisions like that going your way and your team has given absolutely everything they've got, it's a difficult one to swallow.</p>
      <p>"I was delighted with aspects of the performance apart from the final result.</p>
      <p>"There comes a point where you have to admire the boys who gave absolutely everything, they were just three minutes short of getting a result.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we have to turn those performances into points. These (Leeds) are the best team in the league, I've analysed them enough to say that.</p>
      <p>"I see them cutting through teams and I mean at will, and they had more shots than us, they had possession, but we were always in the game, and that's the satisfying aspect."</p>
      <p>Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa could understand Jones' frustration, but felt the decision could not be blamed for the goal.</p>
      <p>He said: "We had 15 chances to score, I don't link the possible foul with the possibility of scoring, you can interpret it like that, but the possible foul was 80 metres away from the opponents goal.</p>
      <p>"In those 80 metres, happened a lot of things that aren't linked with the beginning of the action and the development and the finish of the chance, but I can understand the opponent and maybe the supporters can link both situations.</p>
      <p>"I think the result was fair, it was a good performance from the team.</p>
      <p>"In the first half, it was a little bit easier for us, but in the second half we had to fight a little bit more.</p>
      <p>"It's very difficult to win if you don't fight you don't have a good condition to play, and if you want to win, you have to right, if not you cannot."</p>
      <p>After a first half in which Town keeper James Shea made a superb double save from Phillips and Jack Harrison to keep the scores goalless, Leeds led on 51 minutes through Bamford's opener.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later, Collins powered home his sixth of the season from Brown's fantastic cross, before the late winner.</p>
