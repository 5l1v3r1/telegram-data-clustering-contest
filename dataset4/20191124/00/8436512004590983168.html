      <p>To spur the development of smart cities in the Philippines, Singapore-based BCB Blockchain has signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with Manila.</p>
      <p>According to a November 23 press release, BCB Blockchain contributed $300,000 to support incubators and startup accelerators in the Philippines by signing an MoA with the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development, Cointelegraph reported.</p>
      <p>The joint initiative aims to facilitate the development of local startups focused on the creation of smart city projects and applications. Additionally, the company has reportedly partnered with a range of local educational institutions to share its expertise and contribute to research and development, promotional activities, hackathons, collaborative endeavors and other projects for smart city or blockchain development.</p>
      <p>Douglas Gan, CEO of BCB Blockchain, said: “We will guide and provide them the access to hands-on workshops, funding, materials, events and technical support.”</p>
      <p>This summer, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) of the Philippines signed an MoA with US-based blockchain firm Monsoon Blockchain Storage, Under the deal, Monsoon was set to act as a blockchain consultant and adviser to the DICT, offering services such as cost-benefit and socio-economic analyses regarding blockchain solutions in the Philippines.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Philippine Senator Grace Poe said that local lawmakers should not be in a hurry to pass financial technology regulation. Poe stated:</p>
      <p>“To most of our countrymen, this is alien to them, but in fact some of them have been availing of it through online lending. And without the proper information and education, a lot of them are actually victimized.”</p>
