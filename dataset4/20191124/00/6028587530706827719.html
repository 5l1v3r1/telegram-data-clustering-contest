      <p>When it comes to personal finance management, the needs of entrepreneurs are different to those of employees. Not only do entrepreneurs lack steady predictable incomes, they also have different spending decisions. For example, while corporates pay to send their staff on training courses, as an entrepreneur, I pay for my own professional development. Often, spending and saving decisions are not obvious. Instead of debating between spending on a luxury holiday or topping up a pension plan, entrepreneurs and freelancers are often choosing between investing in an opportunity for their business or their savings account. Both options seem sensible, but which one is better? </p>
      <p>Lucia Langella, partner at St James’s Place Wealth Management, has worked with employees and entrepreneurs, and offers this advice:</p>
      <h3>Have a plan</h3>
      <p>Langella says that the need to have a financial plan applies to entrepreneurs and employees alike. She suggests you begin by determining and prioritizing your short, medium and long term objectives and needs. </p>
      <p>It is best to do this before you embark on the entrepreneurial journey. I know many new entrepreneurs who gave themselves a deadline from the start: if their business does not generate a specific income by a specific time, they would go back to full time employment. </p>

      <h3>Adjust as necessary</h3>
      <p>“As circumstances change, and sometimes unexpectedly, your personal financial plan must be adjusted accordingly. Having contingency plans in place helps you avoid being caught unprepared.” Simply reacting to the unexpected “can lead you to take the wrong decision in a vulnerable and stressful state,” says Langella.</p>
      <p>Circumstances also change naturally as we go through life. The financial risks for starting a business in a college dorm room are different to the risks taken by someone in their 40s. While it is impossible to plan for everything, having an idea of what you want at different life stages is a good idea.</p>
      <h3>Prioritize your professional and financial objectives</h3>
      <p>Professional and financial objectives do not always go hand in hand in the short term. For example, while my decision to pursue a top tier MBA was an investment in my career, the high tuition fees are a financial pain. Most professionals have had to do free work to pursue an opportunity or to get case studies for their new business. </p>
      <p>While doing this is necessary at some stages, it is also unsustainable for the long term. This is where personal finance planning and business planning overlap. It is important for entrepreneurs to understand how much of their time they are able to spend pursuing opportunities and raising their profile without earning any money. </p>
      <p>The opportunity cost of time can be hard to understand, especially for new entrepreneurs. This is why the aforementioned deadlines can help you stay focussed. </p>
      <h3>Financial wellbeing is part of overall wellbeing</h3>
      <p>Worries about money are one of the leading causes of stress. Taking care of your finances is taking care of yourself. Like exercise, meditation and a balanced diet, taking time to understand your financial position and making a plan is part of looking after yourself.</p>
      <p>While I certainly find it tempting to prioritize my business over every other aspect of life, Langella advises to resist this temptation. She says “making the time to understand and look after your personal finances has a positive impact on the entrepreneur’s wellbeing. As a consequence, this makes their business more sustainable.” </p>
      <p>As with many things in life, in order to get to where you need to go, you first need to understand your starting point and then plan your journey. For entrepreneurs, taking the time and effort to invest in their financial wellbeing is what makes their business more sustainable in the long run. </p>
