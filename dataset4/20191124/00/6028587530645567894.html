      <p>Helping others is a known enhancer of quality of life. Volunteering and giving back to your community helps increase your gratitude, reduces anxiety and may even increase your productivity.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/10/16/volunteering-a-formula-for-help-and-happiness/#599514b33cdc">Research</a> suggests that people who volunteered weekly experienced the same happiness boost compared to receiving a life-changing increase in pay. Giving back doesn’t just feel good in the moment; it has long-lasting benefits for your <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/volunteering-may-be-good-for-body-and-mind-201306266428">health and well-being</a>.</p>
      <p>But even with the best of intentions, you may find it hard to make time to get involved.</p>
      <p>If you need extra motivation, here are the five critical career lessons you will learn from helping others and engaging in social causes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lesson #1: How to speak up when you disagree</b>
      </p>
      <p>Knowing how to express concern and push for organizational changes is one of the hardest career lessons to learn. Come on too strong and you risk being pegged as a troublemaker, but speak up too infrequently and you aren’t taken seriously as a professional.</p>
      <p>This is especially sensitive if you are a woman or person of color, with the additional burden of overcoming an unconscious bias that you are complaining or being emotional.</p>
      <p>Regardless, choosing when to speak out against an established cultural norm or way of doing business isn’t an easy decision.</p>
      <p>Volunteering for a cause you believe in forces you to wrestle with this dilemma in an environment that isn’t tied to your paycheck. You get a chance to practice expressing your values and advocating for people with less power than you.</p>
      <p>The more you get to exercise this skill, the better you will get at channeling your displeasure, or even outrage, into actions that actually address the issue. You learn to move from personal frustration to solutions much faster, which will make you an invaluable resource to any company.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lesson #2: How to be a follower</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a lot said and written about how to be a good leader, but not nearly enough attention is spent on how to be a follower. Yet much of your career success will be determined by who you choose to follow and how you manage those relationships.</p>
      <p>Playing even a small part in a volunteer organization teaches you how to evaluate what makes you trust a leader and how to derive satisfaction from pursuing someone else’s strategy.</p>
      <p>The goal is to walk away from your time volunteering with a much clearer sense of your ability to follow. Are you able to trust the judgement of others or do you get easily frustrated when you aren’t in charge?</p>
      <p>Following isn’t about blind devotion; it requires discernment, commitment and loyalty. These are the same values that will help you achieve on behalf of your boss or organization and build strong sponsorship.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lesson #3: How to tackle problems others are afraid of</b>
      </p>
      <p>No matter how senior you are or what field you are in, being a sought-after problem solver is the secret to advancing your career to the next level. </p>
      <p>When the hardest issues or most challenging clients come your way, you need to be prepared to address them. But learning how to solve hard problems isn’t easy.</p>
      <p>You get better at it when you develop your ability to gather and understand historical context and quickly consolidate many differing views. You also have to be willing to work toward a less than perfect solution and refine your approach as you go. These are the exact skills that are built from engaging meaningfully in hard societal problems.</p>
      <p>Taking time to give back inevitably enhances your career by further developing your capacity to address complex and difficult issues.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lesson #4: How to defer to experts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Passion is not the same as expertise. You may be passionate about climate change, human rights, affordable housing or stopping animal cruelty, but you might not know enough about these topics to propose viable solutions. You have to defer to the experts.</p>
      <p>In your career, learning when to bring in outside expertise can save you from making bad, potentially career-derailing business decisions.</p>
      <p>Your volunteering and philanthropy should allow you to meet and learn from experts in a variety of fields. Take the opportunity to watch for examples of leaders that leverage expertise well and build strong cases for the solutions they propose.</p>
      <p>But also pay attention to the pitfalls of decisions made without supporting data or without the inclusion of relevant experts on the topic. Sometimes seeing what <i>not </i>to do is the more effective teacher.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lesson #5: How to accept defeat and play the long game</b>
      </p>
      <p>It would be nice if you could fix all the world problems simply by putting forth your best effort, but that isn’t how life works. All causes have victories and setbacks and knowing how to accept disappointment is a critical skill you will learn while trying to give back.</p>
      <p>Take a look at your career to date and assess your ability to fail or accept defeat.</p>
      <p>There’s a time and place for switching jobs if you are undervalued or can’t achieve your purpose, but you’ll be hurt in the long run by hasty decisions that may be motivated by a fear of failure.</p>
      <p>Playing the long game in your career helps you see when a setback on the job should be overlooked or when it is in your best interest to weather a storm. Remember that ambition gets all the glory, but patience is often the hidden secret to extraordinary careers.</p>
      <p>By giving back and volunteering, you can practice and learn each of these lessons while making your unique contribution to the world.</p>
