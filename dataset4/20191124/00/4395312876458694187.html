      <p>Finding yourself, who you are and what you want to be, it is the most important adventure a person can have in their life. But it has been seen many times that people often spend their entire lives not knowing who they are and what they want to be. They just blindly follow the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-society-based-on-following-the-rules-doesnt-work-as-the-panama-papers-leak-revealed-a6971611.html">rules of society</a> and move with them.</p>
      <p>It is very common for a person to think that finding yourself is an entirely self-centered and selfish goal, but on the contrary finding more about yourself will not only help you in your life but it will also help the person to become the <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/why-partnership-is-the-best-place-for-personal-growth/">best partner</a>, parent, etc. when a person finds more about themselves, they know that what they value, what do they want, and what do they bring to the table.</p>
      <p>The way to discovering yourself involves a lot of breaking up your life into different layers and removing those layers that do not serve any purpose. Once you know that your layers consist of only those memories that reflect who you truly are, you can start the crucial act of building up new layers that are based on what you learned from the previous experience. These new layers enable a person to recognize their true potential while allowing us to be open to new experiences and lessons. With the above things in mind, here are a few ways you can discover yourself.</p>
      <h3>Looking Into Your Past</h3>
      <p>One of the most effective ways to learn more about yourself is to dive deep into your past. There has been a lot of research that shows that everything we do, love, hate, defines who we are. Our past experiences, <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-to-overcome-all-emotional-blocks-and-become-self-actualized-rare-f1c105e69074">unresolved traumas</a>, and many other things define who we are and how we act today.</p>
      <p>Research suggests that everything we do today is defined by what has happened to us in the past. If we know about the source of our traits, we can discover ourselves easily and efficiently.</p>
      <h3>Know Your Personality</h3>
      <p>Knowing your personality can often explain your behaviors and habits. Many people don’t know anything about it and they tend to ignore it, but the reality is that every person in this entire world has a specific type of personality that explains their behavior and emotional traits. Fortunately finding what type of personality a person has is fairly easy, with the use of an <a href="https://enneagram.bz/">enneagram test</a>, we can determine what type of personality the person has and what traits the personality offers.</p>
      <h3>Find What You Are Good At</h3>
      <p>Finding what the person is good at can severely help you in discovering yourself. You have to find what your good at, it might take some time, some trial and error, but it is the most important part of finding yourself. Once you find out what you are good at and what you are not, you can use the list to isolate your past experiences and find out what made you like or dislike certain things. You can use this information to design a path for yourself and <a href="https://blog.mindvalley.com/a-story-about-personal-growth/">grow exponentially</a>.</p>
      <h3>Ask For Feedback</h3>
      <p>If we interact with different people, we can be sure that we leave an impression of ourselves onto the other person. We sometimes don’t even know about what type of impression we are letting on. We can ask people about our impressions on them, and what they think about our personality. Their answers can help provide you insights on your behavior, your personality, your traits, and many other things. We can also find our <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/a-lesson-about-strengths-and-weaknesses-60b3f0354b84">strengths and weakness</a> better from other people than we can assess them for ourselves. We can use this information to explore ourselves and even compare our assessments with the ones that people provided us and develop a plan to improve ourselves.</p>
