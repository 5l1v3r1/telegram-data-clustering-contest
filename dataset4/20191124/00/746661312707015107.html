      <p>The woman arrived from Erbil, Iraq<br/>Her passport was confiscated and she is banned from leaving Germany</p>
      <p><b>FRANKFURT</b>: A woman believed to have belonged to <a href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/502139/afghan-taliban-claim-victory-over-daesh-in-nangarhar/">Daesh</a> and her three children has arrived back in her home country Germany, police told AFP Sunday.</p>
      <p>The woman is the first adult female Daesh member to have been returned through official channels to Germany from Syria.</p>
      <p>Named only as Laura H., the 30-year-old from Hesse state arrived at Frankfurt airport late Saturday on a flight from Erbil, Iraq.<br/>While Laura H. was not immediately arrested on arrival, she remains the subject of an investigation on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organization as well as failure to properly care for her children, news weekly Der Spiegel reported citing security sources.</p>
      <p>Her passport has been confiscated and she has been banned from leaving the country, while her children are being entrusted to a close reative, Spiegel added.<br/>According to the magazine, she travelled in 2016 from Giessen in central Germany to Syria with her children and her husband, a Somalia-born US citizen, where she joined Daesh.<br/>She had already been linked to Salafist circles in Germany and allegedly posted an online call for aid donations for Syria that in reality went to a fundamentalist group.</p>
      <p>Following her husbandâ€™s reported killing and her own capture by Kurdish security forces, Laura H. claims to have turned away from Daesh ideology.<br/>A US aid organization helped bring her to Erbil from the Al-Hol prison camp in northeastern Syria, Spiegel reported.<br/>Kurdish authorities have repeatedly urged Western countries to repatriate their nationals linked to Daesh, but they have been largely reluctant to do so.</p>
      <p>A Turkish invasion of northern Syria last month sparked concern of a mass breakout from Kurdish-held jails and camps.<br/>Germany had already brought home a handful of orphans, but no adults until Saturday.<br/>Austria, Belgium, Britain and France have also repatriated some orphaned children, while the United States has repatriated several women and their children.<br/>An Albanian boy taken by his mother to join Daesh in Syria returned to his home in Italy earlier this month.<br/>Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kosovo have all repatriated dozens of women and children.</p>
