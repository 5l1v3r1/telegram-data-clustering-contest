        <b>It seems not a week goes by without something happening in Riga City Council – Harmony’s issued ultimatum seems to have shaken up the ground beneath Riga Mayor Oļegs Burovs’ chair.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Burovs managed to fulfil one of Harmony’s requirements – dismiss Vadims Baraņņiks from the post of vice-mayor of Riga and his post in the municipality’s capital associations. However, the mayor soon admitted – if he fails to secure majority support in Riga City Council, he will step down and organize snap elections.</p>
      <p>It is possible the situation will not end with this, because the opposition has collected the necessary number of signatures to initiate Burovs’ dismissal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, signature collection has commenced in favour of dissolving the 13<sup>th</sup> Saeima. Publicly available information allows for the belief that authors of the idea and its loudest supporters are unlikely interested in ensuring welfare for Latvian residents. Both Latvia’s President Egils Levits and ex-President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga say they see no reasons for dismissal of Latvia’s parliament.</p>
      <p>Last week, Latvian doctors announced plans to organize a new protest outside the Saeima and demand dismissal for Healthcare Minister Ilze Viņķele. Her political party, meanwhile, proposes increasing budget deficit in Latvia to satisfy healthcare workers’ demands.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The BNN gives you a summary of the key events of the past week, told in news stories of the following topics: Tremors; Departure; Money search; Saeima’s dismissal; Six years; Search; Threats and Confidence.</b>

      <p>
        <b>Opposition parties in Riga City Council have collected the necessary 20 signatures to initiate the dismissal of Mayor Oļegs Burovs, as reported by For Latvia’s Development party’s representative Ieva Graudiņa-Šutko.</b>
      </p>
      <p>«We can see Burovs failing at managing the city council. This is why the decision has been made to request his dismissal,» she said.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the Law on Local Governments, a meeting for non-confidence vote towards a city council chairman is to be organized within two weeks.</p>
      <p>When asked why the opposition decided to «go the long way» instead of organizing extraordinary meetings in a single day, Vilnis Ķirsis explained that «Burovs may as well organize the meeting tomorrow».</p>
      <p>He did not comment why the opposition has picked such a tactic, nor did he say if the opposition would even participate and vote at such a meeting.</p>
      <p>Dainis Locis said this way the opposition will test Burovs’ ability to secure majority of votes.</p>

        <b>With votes from opposition deputies, Riga City Council’s Vice-Chairman Vadims Baraņņiks was removed from his post on Tuesday, 19 November. He was also removed from his post in Riga Freeport board.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of Harmony and Honour to Serve Riga, as well as all opposition members, voted in favour of Baraņņiks’ dismissal. A total of 40 votes were cast in favour of his dismissal.</p>
      <p>Six independent deputies abstained in the vote.</p>
      <p>According to representatives of the opposition, they supported Baraņņiks’ dismissal because «he was not fit for the post of vice-mayor».</p>
      <p>At the same time, the opposition’s plan is organizing three consecutive extraordinary meetings without taking part in them thereby creating a precedent for dismissal of the city council.</p>

        <b>Political parties association <i>Attīstībai/Par!</i> (AP) invites allocating the necessary EUR 60 million for doctors’ wages at the expense of budget deficit, as reported by the political party’s representative Amālija Brūvere.</b>
      </p>
      <p>AP intends to submit its proposals for discussion to the government and will insist on expanding the state budget for 2020 in the near future, as reported by the party association.</p>
      <p>Healthcare Minister Ilze Viņķele has submitted to Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš plans for healthcare development and reform approved by the previous government and improved by the current government in Latvia.</p>
      <p>The political power references European Commission’s published assessment of EU member states’ budgets on 20 November, in which the EC outlines the negative effect the previous Latvian government’s exacted tax changes had on budget revenue and warns of resurfacing risks. At the same time, the EC is positive about Latvia’s budget plan. It is clear that even full compliance with EU regulations would allow reducing Latvia’s budget deficit by a little, reminds the party association.</p>
      <p>EC’s published analysis mentions that «of all sectors, healthcare funding will decline the most: to 3.5% of GDP».</p>

      </p>
      <p>If the previous Saeima left some «cuckoo eggs» for the new parliament before leaving, such as something in legislation, this does not mean the current Saeima is to blame, says Vīķe-Freiberga.</p>
      <p>When asked if the ruling coalition in the Saeima made some mistake during the budget approval process and should the budget be returned for a repeated review, the ex-president stressed that all state institutions have to plan their work, continue their objectives and pay wages to their employees.</p>

        <b>Riga City Pardaugava Court denies claims made by a number of people about slow progress with the review of the criminal case regarding the Zolitude tragedy. On top of that, the court says those are attempts to secure positive personal promotion at the expense of the tragedy’s victims and such claims mislead society.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Thursday, 21 November, one of the judges in charge of Zolitude tragedy case Erlens Ernstons told journalists about the discipline of participants of the process in attending all court sessions in spite of heavy involvement in other processes.</p>
      <p>Court chairperson Adrija Buliņa said there are no reasons to believe the scheduled court session of 26 November might not happen. The court leaned that the sick judge Dzintra Zemitāne is unlikely to return to work. If this happens, the judge may be replaced with a reserve judge, in this case this may be Anita Grāvīte.</p>
      <p>This means the review of the case will be continued and completed by a new team of judges.</p>
      <p>Ernstons explains that the 11 September’s court session was postponed because of passing inability to work of the accused. The next court hearing was scheduled for 18 September.</p>
      <p>On 13 September, information was received from judge Dzintra Zemitāne that she would take a sick leave on 14 September. Complying with the judge’s inability to work, the criminal case was taken from the review agenda five times, amending the criminal case’s review dates until 30 October.</p>

        <b>Lithuanian firefighters have reminded of government commitments in the field in a protest in Vilnius over the average wage of 430 euros and outdated equipment.</b>
      </p>
      <p>LRT, the Lithuanian public broadcaster, reports that in a protest on Tuesday, November 19, dome 50 firefighters staged a rally outside the government building in Vilnius.</p>
      <p>Algis Lisauskas, the president of the Association of Firefighters Unions, told LRT.lt that, due to underfunding, firefighters may have to celebrate Christmas without a pay.</p>
      <p>«This year, we have a funding gap of 2.6 million euros. This means that we will not be able to pay firefighters in December,» Lisauskas explained.</p>
      <p>According to him, municipal firefighters make, on average, 430 euros a month and the equipment they use is hopelessly antiquated. If things don’t change, municipal fire services might collapse, Lisauskas said.</p>
      <p>Firefighter unions have estimated that, in order to operate and meet the commitments to their workers, the services will need 32 million euros of the central government’s funding, but the current budget proposal only assigns 27 million.</p>
