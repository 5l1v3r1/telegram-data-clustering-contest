      <h1>The new Dembele: healthy life and the desire to be crucial for Barca!</h1>

        <b>In an interview with FC Barcelona's official media, Ousmane Dembele made some confessions days before facing his former team Borussia Dortmund. "I want to show what I can do on the pitch," he confessed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Frenchman<b> is very temperamental with the way he plays. </b>He can turn Camp Nou upside down, or he can despair even the easiest of passes. He harbours an exciting future but has also been hampered with injuries. He reviewed all of this in an interview with the club.</p>
      <p>How is <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/o-dembele-241919/">Dembele </a>doing? "Barca is a great team, with big players and that <b>makes you want to give everything</b>. In preseason I was very good. Then I got injured and I was out for one month. <b>When I came back, I had some physical problems</b>. Now I have to fight for the position because we have a great team and there is more competition than in previous seasons. There are very very good strikers, with a lot of quality. and this motivates us to be even better. We have to progress together and do well."</p>
      <p>But it doesn't look the same now. And it is influenced by some changes that the French attacker himself unveiled. "Since my arrival at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barca</a> three years ago, I've improved in the preparation of matches.<b> I go to the gym</b>, I warm up more before training and train well," he said. </p>
      <p>The reason for the interview was the visit to Borussia Dortmund, as it will be the first time he comes up against the Germans since signing for Barcelona. "It will be special. I still keep in touch with my former teammates. We will be rivals, but <b>nothing changes.</b> I left 3 years ago and I haven't seen them since.<b> Emotionally, it will be a bit difficult</b>, but I'll be happy to see them and play against them," he said.</p>

      <p>He also spoke about Leo Messi and what it's like to play with him: "He is a great player. I watched him on TV when I was younger, but to play with him and <b>see him in real life is even better.</b> It is an honour that he says that <b>I am talented, but I have to show it"</b> he stated.</p>
      <p>He also spoke about Griezmann and said that he gives him <b>"a lot of advice"</b> and that "he has not needed a lot of time to adapt".</p>
