      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/monsta-x"><b>MONSTA X</b></a> fans are fairly certain that <b>Wonho</b> was originally part of <b>MONSTA X</b>'s season's greetings.</p>
      <p>The video shows the current 6 members posing in front of a wall that has their names written out in paint, along with 'MBB' for <b>Monbebe</b>.<b> </b>However, fans noticed that there were letters written inside the heart behind <b>Shownu</b> and <b>I.M</b> - and it looks like the letters read 'Wonho'.</p>

      <p>It wouldn't be surprising if it were in fact the case - usually, season's greetings photos are shot much in advance, so it would make sense that they originally had Wonho in the photos and had to retake photos without Wonho.</p>
      <p>Do you think the theory is true?</p>
