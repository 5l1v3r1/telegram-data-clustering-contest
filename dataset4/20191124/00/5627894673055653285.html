      <p>NEW YORK CITY - Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg entered the 2020 presidential race on Sunday following weeks of speculation about whether he would join the crowded Democratic primary. <br/><br/>The television ad touts Bloomberg's record as mayor and promises "to rebuild the country and restore faith in the dream that defines us: where the wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share; everyone without health insurance can get it and everyone who likes theirs, keep it; where jobs won't just help you get by but get ahead." <br/><br/>"And on all those things, Mike Bloomberg intends to make good," the ad said. The new ad is part of his $31 million television ad buy. <br/><br/>Bloomberg's announcement comes on the heels of him filing paperwork for the Alabama primary, which is scheduled for March 3. The move is a shift from his decision earlier this year when he said he would not be running for president. <br/><br/>Still, his calculus had clearly changed over the coming weeks. He was recently talking with his close allies about running for president as former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to stumble as a front runner against Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p>
