      <p><b>SANTA CRUZ, St Elizabeth — Blessed with more than 40 years experience in journalism, Melville Harris is perhaps best known in St Elizabeth as the 'RJR man' and as a long running presenter on the programme, </b><b>The Rural Report</b> <b>.</b></p>
      <p>Yet, long before he joined Jamaica's oldest radio station, <i>RJR</i>, in 1987, Harris had soaked his feet as a news correspondent for The <i>Gleaner</i>.</p>
      <p>In a recent chat with the <b>Jamaica Observer</b>, Harris told colourful stories including traversing water-soaked St Elizabeth post-Hurricane Gilbert without a change of clothes for 72 hours, reporting on a boat stuck at sea during a hurricane warning, reporting on accidents, murders, drought, politics...</p>
      <p>He has done it all.</p>
      <p>The way Harris tells it, his life in journalism began in 1976 when he was in sixth form at St Jago High School and was asked to cover a sporting event.</p>
      <p>After high school he transitioned into working for the <i>Gleaner</i> as a correspondent for St Catherine. He later moved to St Elizabeth where he continued working for The <i>Gleaner</i> until 1987 when he joined <i>RJR,</i> where he has remained ever since.</p>
      <p>Working in the aftermath of Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, is among his most memorable experiences. He managed to travel across the parish in the company of Government officials to report on the devastation. He had to access the intermittent telephone service from police stations and private residences.</p>
      <p>It was his familiarity with the environment that allowed him access to the telephone service without great hassle. Since Hurricane Gilbert he has covered other hurricanes and weather systems. Harris has also covered every election in St Elizabeth since 1986.</p>
      <p>He has vivid memories of an assignment in Elim, St Elizabeth. He told the <b>Sunday Observer</b> that on sitting down to write the news story, he discovered, to his horror, that the tape was blank. His tape recorder had malfunctioned.</p>
      <p>However, he was able to do his job because “as usual I always have my backup, my notes are always there and when you run into problems you go to your notes.”</p>
      <p>In Harris's media bag there is a Zoom Marantz digital recorder and always, his trusty notebook.</p>
      <p>Harris remembers well his earliest days as a reporter when he had to tediously dictate his stories by telephone to typists hired by the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Eventually, he painstakingly taught himself how to type, using the manual model of the Olympia typewriter. The fax machine and the telegram were vital tools that assisted him in submitting stories for publication.</p>
      <p>Some challenges over the years include navigating St Elizabeth's vast terrain. “St Elizabeth is a tough parish to traverse... to be more specific, this is due to the poor road conditions we have to deal with — a 10-mile journey can take you one hour or more,” he said.</p>
      <p>Another challenge is the unfamiliarity of some editors with rural Jamaica. Their focus is more “centred around the metropolis”, Harris said.</p>
      <p>As a lifelong learner, Harris has participated in a few journalism fellowships in the United States and Canada. He reads several publications on a daily basis: <i>The Gleaner, The Jamaica Observer, New York Times, Washington Post</i>, <i>Toronto Sun</i>. He is big on accuracy and maintaining the confidence of his sources. “My motto is when in doubt, leave it out,” he said.</p>
      <p>Even while deeply involved in journalism, Harris has found time for other pursuits including working as a paralegal and training as a seminarian. He has held jobs at the Post and Telegraph Department, the Social Development Commission; he was a public relations practitioner and a pig farmer.</p>
      <p>He has been a Justice of the Peace since 1997 — a role he is very passionate about and which he describes as being among his most fulfilling.</p>
      <p>Harris has had several executive posts with the Lay Magistrates' Association of Jamaica, where he serves in a public relations capacity and is an expert at mediation. His diligence has not gone unnoticed, as the organisation has awarded him twice in appreciation for services rendered. Recently he was elected regional vice president (Cornwall).</p>
      <p>Harris has also served on numerous school boards and on the board of Negril Education and Environment Trust, which gives material help to students.</p>
      <p>Harris enjoys spending time with his family and friends, and has a special relationship with his daughter, whom he refers to as his “bunny rabbit”.</p>
      <p>For the future, Harris told the <b>Sunday Observer</b> that he doesn't have plans to retire any time soon. “I don't know what the future holds, as long as I have health and strength, I will still be around and as long as the media sees it fit, I will continue,” he said.</p>
