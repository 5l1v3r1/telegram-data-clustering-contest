      <p>Last week Thursday was another day to remember for the stars that featured in EbonyLife Films, Your Excellency, as they interfaced with journalists on their roles in the movie.</p>
      <p>As expected, there was huge interest in how Funke Akindele-Bello managed to direct and star in the movie, especially as this is her directorial debut. Her ‘other half’ in the film, Akin Lewis, was relaxed and charismatic, much like his onscreen character, presidential aspirant, Chief Olalekan Ajadi. The rest of the cast were equally light-hearted, hinting at the hilarious comedy they have in store for their fans across the country.</p>
      <p>Cast that graced the gathering included, Kemi ‘Lala’ Akindoju, Eku Edewor, Emmanuel ‘EmmaOhMaGod,’ Alexx Ekubo, Deyemi Okanlawon.Others were Ini Dima-Okojie, Chioma ‘Chigul’ Omeruah, Ikechukwu Onunaku and Helen Paul.</p>
      <p>Executive Producer, Mo Abudu, appreciating the cast and media said, she is grateful to her sponsors Guinness Gold, Bollinger and Coca-Cola, for making the occasion an eventful one. Your Excellency will hit the cinemas across the country from December 13.</p>
