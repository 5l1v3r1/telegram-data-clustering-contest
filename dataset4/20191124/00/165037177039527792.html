        <b>Giancarlo Gallifuoco scored as A-League strugglers Central Coast Mariners defeated Western United 1-0, ending a long wait for a clean sheet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Central Coast Mariners kept their <b>first A-League clean sheet since February 2018</b> as Giancarlo Gallifuoco's fortuitous strike secured a 1-0 win over Western United to move them off the foot of the table.</p>
      <p>United would have risen into <b>third place with a victory in Gosford on Sunday</b>, but the struggling Mariners held firm to claim their second win of the season.</p>
      <p>Former Italy international Alessandro Diamanti went close for United with a free-kick late in the first half, but it was Central Coast who made the breakthrough four minutes after the interval when Gallifuoco's volley took a wicked deflection off Aaron Calver.</p>
      <p>Filip Kurto did his best to react, yet could only push it in off the inside of his right-hand upright.</p>

      <p>Alen Stajcic's side endured a nervy wait while there was a VAR check for a potential handball in the box from Ziggy Gordon late on, but the Mariners' luck was in.</p>
      <p>And after Josh Risdon headed wide in stoppage time, the Mariners were able to celebrate taking points and <b>earning their first clean sheet in the league in 21 months</b>.</p>
