      <p>MADRID (AP) - The United States will face Uzbekistan in qualifiers for the 2020 Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>The Americans, the Davis Cup’s most successful team with 32 titles, will have choice of venues for the tie in March.</p>
      <p>Sunday’s draw also determined that 2019 champion Croatia will face the winner of the Pakistan vs. India series, while Australia will play Brazil and Colombia will face Argentina.</p>
      <p>Other matchups include: Hungary vs. Belgium; Italy vs. South Korea; Germany vs. the Netherlands and Japan vs. Ecuador.</p>
      <p>The 12 home-and-away ties will consist of four singles matches and one doubles match in best-of-three sets.</p>

      <p>All series will be played March 6-7, with the winners qualifying for the 2020 finals in Madrid.</p>
      <p>This year’s semifinalists already qualified - Britain, Canada, Spain and Russia. France and Serbia have been given wild-card entries.</p>
      <p>The revamped 18-team finals - reduced to one week in one city and three matches per tie - is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, an investment group co-founded by Barcelona star Gerard Piqué.</p>
      <p>The overhaul was aimed at making the traditional team competition more attractive and lucrative.</p>
