        <b>Liverpool are storming the Premier League, yet Pep Guardiola insists his Manchester City side will not give up.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Pep Guardiola</b> has no doubt his <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> side will<b> fight to the bitter end </b>even if he concedes the Premier League title race may already be over.</p>
      <p>City <b>came from behind to claim a vital 2-1 win </b>over Chelsea on Saturday, after unbeaten table-toppers Liverpool had temporarily moved <b>12 points clear of the defending champions</b> thanks to a victory at Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>However, with the gap between Liverpool and the chasing pack – including second-placed Leicester City and fourth-placed Chelsea – already so large, <b>Guardiola acknowledged the Reds may already have one hand on the trophy.</b></p>
      <p>The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach, though, insists <b>he will never doubt his team's desire </b>to fight for glory.</p>
      <p>"The only pressure we can have is that <b>we're going to lose the Premier League.</b> Okay. That is the pressure. We're going to lose the Premier League," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's not the first time Manchester City lose the Premier League. So, we're going to lose the Premier League, <b>we're going to try the next season".</b></p>
      <p><b>"We didn't give up last season and that's why we won again</b>. Maybe we're going to lose, but this team never gives up. This team tries".</p>
      <p>"It's far away, with these numbers <b>Liverpool are unstoppable</b>. But if you believe I am going to doubt my players because they didn't try, you are wrong".</p>
      <p>"We would not have been able to do what we have done, <b>100 points, four titles</b>, it never happened before and even this season we are there and you see the games. One, judge the result, but I try to judge performance, and I see every morning, every day my team and<b> I don't have doubts we're going to try."</b></p>

      <p>Guardiola's side have<b> already lost three league matches</b> this season, having only been beaten four times en route to the title last term.</p>
      <p>But Guardiola believes<b> it is ridiculous to expect City to be able to keep on improving</b> on the levels they have shown in previous seasons.</p>
      <p>"It looks like how we have won two Premier Leagues, we'd have to win seven Premier Leagues in a row and have to make 200 points every season," he said. </p>
      <p><b>"It doesn't work in that way at that high level.</b> In tennis, players lose games. In golf, it's not always Tommy Fleetwood who wins the tournaments, I would like that, but it's not".</p>
      <p>"How is our spirit after 1-0 down, the way we played in Anfield in every game, that is how I like to see my team.<b> I would like to see us there, nine points, </b>we are in November so wow, many games we have to play."</p>
      <p>Guardiola also feels <b>putting too much weight behind a defeat is a worrying trend</b> for society at large.</p>
      <p>"We did it for the last 24 months or more.<b> If you win, you have a good spirit, good character,</b> good everything. If you lose then it is done. So the line is so tight," he added.</p>
      <p>"Winners and losers, that's all. I think for sport, it is a message to society,<b> it's not good for our kids to show that just the winner is perfect."</b></p>
      <p><b>"The importance is the commitment.</b> All sports we want to win. But losing is not a disaster. That's why I said to the players, relax, do our job, we will see what happens."</p>
