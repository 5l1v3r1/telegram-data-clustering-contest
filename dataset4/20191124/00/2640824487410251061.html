      <p><b>from the ideal cities of the renaissance, to modernist utopias such as brasília or chandigarh, ‘model’ cities have existed throughout history.</b> however, pyongyang, the capital of <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architecture-in-korea/"><b>north korea</b></a>, is a metropolis like no other. kitsch, colorful, and dramatic, the city’s architecture is often compared to the aesthetic of a <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/wes-anderson/"><b>wes anderson</b></a> film, where it is difficult to distinguish between reality and theater. now, a new book by <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/cristiano-bianchi/"><b>cristiano bianchi</b></a> and kristina drapić takes readers on a <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architectural-photography/"><b>photographic journey</b></a> through the ‘socialist’ architecture and grand visions of north korea’s secretive capital, which was entirely rebuilt following the korean war.</p>

      <p><b>the publication, titled <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/model-city">model city pyongyang</a>, features 200 color illustrations of buildings rarely seen by non-north koreans, as well as diagrams and architectural drawings that</b> <b>reveal the planning behind the city’s elaborate symbolism. </b>the images are complemented by texts from experts on korean architecture — including an excerpt from <i>on architecture</i> by kim jong-il, father of the current leader kim jong-un. alongside their photos, cristiano bianchi and kristina drapić explain the context of each landmark — research which was supported by <a href="https://koryogroup.com/"><b>koryo studio</b></a> and <b>korea cities federation</b>.</p>

      <p><b>fascinated by the city’s built environment, and how its society interacts with it, bianchi and drapić wanted to convey pyongyang’s theatrical and somewhat alien atmosphere.</b> <i>‘we wanted to capture this feeling of ‘fictional reality’ by following the techniques used by korean artists when depicting the supreme leaders or sacred spaces,’</i> say the authors in the book’s introduction.</p>

      <p><b><i>‘we were fascinated by the striking way in which the sky is represented in art and propaganda — sometimes a simple gradient of colors; sometimes a hyper-saturated sunset or sunrise,’</i> continue the authors.</b> consequently, the backdrop of each photograph in the book has been replaced with a color gradient, evoking the idealized pastel skies of the country’s propaganda posters.</p>
