      <h2>The former England rugby hero has been chosen to lead the camp forward - but that may mean any love in the air between James and Caitlyn will have to wait!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:36:50+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:36</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has been teasing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-haskell">James Haskell</a> about their blossoming romance but it could be all over before it's even begun!</p>
      <p>The rugby star is the camp's first leader - and all his loyal subjects have been falling into line.</p>
      <p>After the votes were counted, Roman Kemp revealed the results with James scoring five and was put at the helm of the jungle.</p>
      <p>A round of applause went round and the jokes soon started.</p>
      <p>James said “Thank you, that’s very kind of you all.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn said playfully: “You better be good or we’re going to fire you.”</p>

      <p>James laughed, adding: “Don’t start with me, you won’t win.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn smirked: “I can’t, you’re the King.”</p>
      <p>James walked into camp and everyone cheered “All hail the leader.” He later asked Jacqueline to join him by the creek.</p>
      <p>James soon told everyone that Jacqueline was his new deputy and that they both were now exempt from all camp chores.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn joked “Our romance is over.... you picked someone else.”</p>
      <p>James laughed and said: “No, no, the leader always has time for all the women in his life, don’t worry about that.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Maxwell broke down in tears and threatened to walk out on Saturday's I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The comedian confessed he had "hit a wall" as he became "overwhelmed" with jungle life.</p>

      <p>Andrew said: "I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say ‘have I done the right thing’."</p>
