      <p><b>BENGALURU:</b> A 29-year-old medical representative was arrested on charges of killing his wife on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The accused, Rakesh Kumar Gupta from Gonda district in Uttar Pradesh, allegedly killed his wife Radha and misled the police saying she fell off the stairs and succumbed to injuries.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Rakesh got married to Radha in 2016 and the couple started living at JC Nagar. Radha, who was a home-maker, suspected Rakesh of having an extra-marital affair and fought with him frequently.</p>
      <p>Rakesh told the police that his wife checked his mobile phone regularly and picked up quarrels over some issue or the other.</p>
      <p>Around 11 pm on November 17, the couple fought again, and in a fit of rage, Rakesh hit Radha with a roller and a cooker lid. He also banged her head against the wall, killing her on the spot.</p>
      <p>The next day morning, he called up Radha's parents and told them that their daughter slipped from the stairs and injured herself. He also lied to them that he had taken her to the hospital for treatment where she died.</p>
      <p>Radha's parents arrived in the city from UP and when they saw their daughter’s body with injuries, they suspected that it was not an accidental death and filed a complained at the Mahalakshmi Layout police station. Radha's body was sent for autopsy and the doctors debunked Rakesh's theory and confirmed that Radha was assaulted and killed.</p>
      <p>The police detained Rakesh and during the interrogation, he confessed to the crime. He told the police that he was fed up with Radha over her frequent quarrels over his extramarital affair.</p>
