        <b>Netherlands and Ajax great Marco van Basten has apologised after he used a term synonymous with the Nazi party live on television.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marco van Basten has apologised after he was heard <b>saying "sieg heil",</b> a phrase <b>synonymous with a Nazi salute,</b> live on Dutch television.</p>
      <p>Former <b>Netherlands, Ajax and AC Milan</b> forward Van Basten was working as an analyst for Fox Sports on Ajax's Eredivisie clash with Heracles on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Prior to the match, Fox presenter Hans Kraay interviewed Heracles coach Frank Wormuth in German.</p>
      <p>However, Kraay's attempt at conducting the interview in German amused Van Basten, who said: "<b>Sieg heil, not so beautiful, pancake</b>."</p>
      <p>That sparked significant controversy, with "sieg heil" having been a phrase commonly used in Nazi Germany before and during World War II.</p>

      <p>Van Basten has subsequently apologised, <b>insisting he did not mean to cause offence.</b></p>
      <p>"I didn't mean to shock people, <b>I just wanted to ridicule Hans' German,</b> but I'm sorry," the 55-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Van Basten's comments follow on from Excelsior player Ahmad Mendes Moreira <b>receiving racist abuse from Den Bosch supporters</b> in a second-tier match last weekend.</p>
      <p>The incident prompted Netherlands star <b>Georginio Wijnaldum to vow to leave the pitch if he was racially abused</b>, as well as calling on the Dutch government to act.</p>
      <p>Protests were also held across the top two tiers in the Netherlands this weekend, with <b>players standing still for the opening minute of each match</b>.</p>
