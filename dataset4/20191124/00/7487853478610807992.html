      <h1>Ed Woodward Pictured Engaging in Fiery Sir Alex Ferguson Debate During Sheffield United Draw</h1>

      <p>​Manchester United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has been pictured in the stands engaging in, what appears to be, a fiery debate with legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson during the 3-3 draw with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The duo were sat in close proximity at Bramall Lane as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side found themselves two goals behind, before remarkably fighting back to lead 3-2 - only for Oli McBurnie's <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6503878-sheffield-utd-3-3-man-utd-report-ratings-reaction-to-unbelievable-clash-at-bramall-lane">​stoppage ti​me equaliser to earn the hosts a share of the spoils.</a></p>

      <p>There was a rollercoaster of emotions for everyone who watched the breathtaking <a href="http://90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> fixture, but for the visitors in particular, as things went from desperation to euphoria to somewhere in the middle within the space of a wild 20-minute second half spell.</p>
      <p>With emotions running high, there appeared to be a pretty tense discussion between Woodward and former manager Ferguson, who still travels to watch his former side on a regular basis despite stepping down six years ago.</p>
      <p>Ferguson won 13 top-flight titles with United since stepping down, but has since watched the club he built into a formidable force fall to pieces, with Solskjaer the latest manager to struggle their efforts to fill the hotseat.</p>

      <p>Though it's unclear what the specific subject of conversation was between Ferguson and Woodward during their first-half conversation, the latter appeared to be unimpressed with what the 77-year-old had to say.</p>
      <p>That, or he was struggling to hear what Woodward was saying - which seems more likely given the boisterous atmosphere on offer at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sir-alex-ferguson-ed-woodward-20951320">​The Mirror</a> offer a little elaboration on the flashpoint, explaining that it lasted for 'a few minutes' with Woodward doing most of the talking, as he gesticulated with his hands to get his point across.</p>
      <p>Things soon-after cooled down, and the duo seemed to be on civil terms afterwards, so it is highly possible that the issue, if indeed there was one, was dealt with at the time - but it remains symbolic of the tensions simmering beneath the surface during an uncertain time for the former English champions.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time this season that Woodward has been pictured in the stands appearing to row with somebody connected to the club. Earlier this season, there were claims that he <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6460817-ed-woodward-appears-to-scold-phil-jones-in-stands-during-man-utd-s-defeat-to-west-ham">​scolded Phil Jones during United's 2-0 defeat at West Ham</a> as the majority of Twitter speculated that the defender had muttered disparaging comments about Solskjaer under his breath.</p>
      <p>Woodward <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6481399-ed-woodward-reveals-what-was-really-said-in-viral-clip-involving-phil-jones">​defused that row by explaining</a> what had really been said, and may find himself needing to satisfy the masses once more after this latest snap from photographers at the game.</p>
