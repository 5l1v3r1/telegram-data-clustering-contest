      <p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors have had their hopes of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/08/real-reason-behind-bitcoins-epic-rally-revealed">a return to bitcoin's all-time-high</a> in 2019 all but dashed after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/22/stark-china-warning-causes-bitcoin-to-suddenly-crash-10-as-other-major-cryptos-nosedive/">the latest sudden sell-off</a>.The bitcoin price has been on a downward trend all month after breaching $10,000 per bitcoin at the end of October and was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/22/stark-china-warning-causes-bitcoin-to-suddenly-crash-10-as-other-major-cryptos-nosedive/#4082fc4653d4">this week hit by a severe bitcoin and crypto trading warning out of China</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/06/25/a-veteran-trader-set-bitcoin-a-100000-target-in-market-like-no-other/#2034df59bd8a">Wall Street veteran Peter Brandt</a>, who made a name for himself by predicting bitcoin's devastating 2018 bear market, has called bitcoin's low for July 2020â€“two months after bitcoin's closely-watched halving event.</p>

      <p>"My target of $5,500 is not far below today's low," Brandt wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1198040324830093312">Twitter</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/22/stark-china-warning-causes-bitcoin-to-suddenly-crash-10-as-other-major-cryptos-nosedive/#4082fc4653d4">Friday's sell-off</a>.</p>
      <p>"But I think the surprise might be in the duration and nature of market. I am thinking about a low in July 2020. That will wear out bulls quicker than a price correction."</p>
      <p>Brandt, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/06/25/a-veteran-trader-set-bitcoin-a-100000-target-in-market-like-no-other/#2034df59bd8a">who earlier this year said bitcoin will eventually hit $100,000 and described the bitcoin market as "like no other,"</a> warned bitcoin bulls "must first be fully purged" before the price will rebound.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/21/crypto-heavyweights-tim-draper-tom-lee-and-cz-all-see-bitcoin-going-sharply-higher-heres-why/#3d0caf1e6344">Brandt's comments echo some of bitcoin's biggest bulls</a>, who have recently come out in force to reassure investors that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/16/perhaps-google-will-kill-bitcoin-after-all/">bitcoin is far from dead</a>.</p>
      <p>As well as the May bitcoin halving, which will see the number of bitcoin rewarded to miners cut by half from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 bitcoin, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/10/31/forget-the-halvingcould-this-be-what-sends-bitcoin-soaring-next-year/#71a4db173062">bitcoin investors are hopeful next year will bring an increase in the number of bitcoin retail investors and people using bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for payments</a>.</p>
      <p>Bakkt, a New York Stock Exchange-owner backed bitcoin and cryptocurrency venture, announced last month it plans to launch a consumer app for cryptocurrency purchases in 2020.</p>
      <p>U.S. coffee chain Starbucks will be its first launch partner, with the company one of the original backers of the crypto project, along with software giant Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Bakkt's bitcoin futures daily volume hit a new all-time high this week, according to data from Intercontinental Exchange, with some $20.3 million across 2,700 futures contracts on Friday.</p>
      <p>Many in the traditional financial industry remain unconvinced by bitcoin and crypto, however.</p>
      <p>This month, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/14/blow-to-bitcoin-as-former-ecb-boss-makes-dire-warning-over-cryptos-future/#7b8f38285e30">former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet slammed bitcoin and Facebook's crypto project, warning bitcoin is "not real" and not the future of money</a>.</p>
