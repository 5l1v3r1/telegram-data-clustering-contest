      <p>LEBANON, N.H. (AP) - Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health has launched a new education campaign in New Hampshire and Vermont about the dangers of vaping.</p>
      <p>The “No Safe Vape” effort includes a website that presents facts about vaping and a list of local, regional and national resources for those seeking further information or help quitting. An advertising campaign is planned, and the health system also hosted a Facebook Live event with experts and teens. Dr. Susanne Tanski, a Dartmouth-Hitchcock pediatrician, also briefed members of the U.S. Senate last week about the hazards of vaping.</p>
