      <h1>Huawei Beats Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy S10+ In New Rating</h1>

      <p>Huawei is the company you can’t write off. Sure, it has problems with the U.S. government and its latest phone, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, is still awaiting a wide release outside China, but it still manages to achieve surprising things. </p>

      <p>DXOMark is best known for its camera reviews, giving authoritative scores for, among other things, the photographic capabilities of smartphones. </p>
      <p>Currently its top-ranking camera on a phone is the <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/huawei-mate-30-pro-camera-review/">Huawei Mate 30 Pro</a> which has a score of 121, never beaten and only equalled by the Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro Premium (which, incidentally should surely have won the award for snappiest name, no?). It won this award because the overall camera score beat the nearest contender, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, handsomely. </p>
      <p>But that’s not the only surprise win Huawei has had in recent weeks. </p>
      <p>DXOMark also conducts audio reviews, and Huawei has gained the very top score here, too. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/huawei-mate-20-x-audio-review/">Huawei Mate 20 X</a>, a huge phone with a whopping 7.2in display, most recently updated to a 5G version, has beaten every other phone tested in this way by DXOMark. </p>
      <p>The company said that the Huawei phone was released as a multimedia powerhouse, and it praised the phone extensively, comparing it favorably to phones including the latest Apple flagship, the iPhone 11 Pro Max.</p>

      <p>DXOMark said:</p>
      <blockquote>The Huawei Mate 20 X is the top scorer in our Audio tests of all the devices we’ve tested thus far, with its Overall score of 75 besting Samsung’s S10+ by ten points and the Note 10+ by 9. It is also the only Android phone we’ve tested that scored above Apple’s large-screen iPhone XS Max—although only by one point. The Mate 20 X did particularly well when playing back movies and music, achieving a substantially higher score for those use cases than any of the other phones we have tested. While still the top scorer among the Android devices we tested, its performance while gaming was less stellar, and behind both the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.</blockquote>
      <p>Okay, so it’s only just better than the latest iPhone, just one point, but it pretty conclusively beats the Samsung Galaxy S10+. </p>
      <p>So, what does this mean?</p>
      <p>Well, for a start, it confirms that Huawei phones are increasingly well-crafted and offer genuine standouts. </p>
      <p>But perhaps it also shows Huawei to be ahead of the curve. Audio quality is only just becoming a thing, though several phone manufacturers, such as Nokia, for instance, have been boasting of their handsets’ sound capabilities for some time. </p>

      <p>But with bigger screens, designed to let you watch video and play games, better audio becomes increasingly important. </p>
      <p>Huawei’s skill is that as it improves the camera, screen, battery life and innovation levels on its phones, it’s not neglecting any part of the package, recognizing audio as an aspect that needs careful attention, too. </p>
      <p>Finally, it is a handy thing for Huawei that this has been won for a phone which is not affected by the company’s issue with the U.S. government: the Mate 20 X predates the problems and is on sale already, unlike the Mate 30 Pro which is still awaiting release.</p>
