        <b>WHEN Josan Sutherland received news that she had been named one of the 2019 Jamaican Chevening Scholars, her immediate reaction was filled with excitement and anticipation for the life-changing journey that she was about to begin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“When I got the call to pick up the official letter I was super excited. I got the e-mail with the #ChosenForChevening tag line at work and my co-workers were screaming with me. I went through the application process and I was successful and now about to pursue a Master of Science in Advanced Neuro Physiotherapy at University College London to further my passion for working with the neurological community — persons with stroke and spinal cord injury. This was a good avenue to further my passion and work with the disabled community,” Sutherland told the <b>Jamaica Observer</b>.</p>
      <p>But in a cruel twist of fate, Sutherland, 27, received news the very next day that she had cancer — a fresh diagnosis that marked her third bout with the illness.</p>
      <p>“Hearing the diagnosis the following day literally took the wind out of my sail. It was such a hard thing to process; not only the illness but here I had my dream, my aspirations, a path ahead of me where I could further myself and further my country and my community and to not be able to utilise that was hard. I was heartbroken,” Sutherland said in a quiet yet sombre tone.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, Sutherland was unable to take up her Chevening Scholarship and now contends with battling a life-threatening illness.</p>
      <p>A physiotherapist by profession, Sutherland was first diagnosed with bone cancer at age 12 while a student at St Andrew High for Girls. Surviving that period of illness led to an amputation of her right leg and Sutherland was able to complete her secondary education and move onto study physiotherapy at The University of the West Indies. However, in the final year of her studies at age 21, Sutherland came face to face with cancer for the second time, but that time it was triple negative breast cancer, which meant it was not triggered by nor fed by hormones. A process of chemotherapy and mastectomy led to Sutherland's recovery.</p>
      <p>Now, Sutherland has a diagnosis of oestrogen and progesterone (ER/PR) positive breast cancer, which means the cancer cells grow in response to the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. She has gone through the surgical process of mastectomy once again and now awaits chemotherapy and hormonal therapy as part of her treatment regime.</p>
      <p>Further, this third diagnosis led her medical team to do further investigations where it was also found that Sutherland has a genetic mutation called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) — a rare disorder that greatly increases the risk of developing several types of cancer, particularly in children and young adults.</p>
      <p>“Because of my young age, right now I am 27, my team and I were concerned that it cannot be coincidental. We don't have a family history of cancer. So we looked at genetic testing to find out if there was a reason behind these three malignancies within such a short time frame and we found that I do have Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), which means I am more prone to developing tumours and once they continue to grow they become malignant.</p>
      <p>“Hearing that it was...I've always been vigilant when it comes to my health. My doctors and I we know each other well because I have been working with them forever. We've done all we could, we've tried all we could [and] for it to be happening a third time it was worrisome. What am I missing? What am I not doing right? What are they missing? On one hand it was relief to find out, OK, this is what is contributing to all that. At the same time it is good to have a diagnosis, but when you find out there is no treatment it is kind of daunting where you say, so what do I do now? We're still figuring out what this diagnosis means for me moving forward and investigating certain treatment options and avenues. It's definitely still a shock and something we're still trying to tackle,” said Sutherland.</p>
      <p>Moreover, her medical expenses has depleted her savings and led to her starting a crowd funding page in order to help offset treatment costs. Those wishing to help can donate at <i>https://gogetfunding.com/help-josan-fight/</i> or directly to Scotiabank Cross Roads branch, account number 000832753. The goal is to raise US$25,000.</p>
      <p>“I am not eligible for health insurance overseas much less in Jamaica given my medical history. Before diagnosis I was working and I had savings and an income. After diagnosis we began the surgical aspect of management. Being that my job is physical activity and physically taxing, I have been unable to work and now that income is limited. I rely on family members but we still have standing bills. I have done the majority of the surgery thus far. They are still in the midst of some investigation. Ahead of us we have chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. For the LFS, a lot of the recommended resource centres are overseas. In terms of risk reductions, treatment or management, those are quite costly. I called one centre and just for a consult they quoted me US $700,” Sutherland said.</p>
      <p>She added: “All of the costs I have had so far in terms of surgery, lab tests specialists, drugs are all out of pocket costs. There has been a lot of generosity on the side of health care practitioners who will lessen fees and delay payments but it's still a costly journey. In terms of figures I can't really predict that. There are some days I will walk into a test or doctor's office and walk out with an envelope full of tests and measures that can easily run me $500,000. We just have to do as it comes.”</p>
      <p>Despite the hand that life has dealt her, Sutherland is appreciative of the support she has received thus far.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people know me and how passionate I am about my work and advocacy, especially when it comes on to breast cancer and cancer in general. They empathise with me and they are in shock we are back at this point of a new diagnosis. They empathise how hard it is to again put life on pause to seek the treatment I need. They have been supportive. People are generally looking out for me as I fight this process to come out on the other side and continue living life,” she said. “I am very grateful for all the assistance I have got so far. It is really heart-warming to see the outpouring of love, to receive the messages of people and have such care shown for me, and by extension, my family. I am really, really grateful. Even if you can't give in cash but you give in kind or you choose to re-share or repost the crowd funding link. I am really, really appreciative.”</p>
      <p>Additionally, she pointed out that she makes a conscious decision to remain positive that the outcome will be favourable.</p>
      <p>“My faith, religious upbringing in church has contributed to it. My personal goals — I know I am here for a reason, I have much to contribute. There is so much I want to get done and so many I want to impact in the process. While this is annoying, to say the least, and hard, I know it is part of the process and nothing really lasts forever. I am pushing through, taking it a day at a time and I am excited to see what's next. It is understanding this illness will be there regardless. I have to choose how I fight and make the choice to stay in a place of peace and positivity and ride that out,” she said.</p>
