      <p>BERLIN, Nov 24 — Bayern Munich crushed Fortuna Duesseldorf 4-0 to move within a point of top spot with a third straight win under interim coach Hansi Flick while Bundesliga leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock defeat at Union Berlin yesterday.</p>
      <p>The champions, who were joined by RB Leipzig on 24 points, have rediscovered winning ways under Flick, getting three victories in all competitions.</p>
      <p>They looked sharp throughout the home fixture in which leading striker Robert Lewandowski failed to score, ending his record run of netting in the previous 11 league games.</p>
      <p>They are third behind Moenchengladbach who were stunned 2-0 by promoted Union in their first league loss after three straight wins. Leipzig are second, above Bayern on goal difference, after a 4-1 victory over strugglers.</p>
      <p>Bayern, who could have scored more, found no resistance in the first half and fired in three by the 34th minute through Benjamin Pavard, Corentin Tolisso and Serge Gnabry.</p>
      <p>Although Polish striker Lewandowski failed to score despite several golden chances, he did set up Philippe Coutinho for Bayern’s fourth goal in the 70th minute.</p>
      <p>“The team did exactly what we demanded from them,” Flick, who took over after the sacking of coach Nico Kovac earlier this month, told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We put them under pressure from the start and showed that we were determined. The team did that impressively in the first half. It is good fun working with these players.”</p>
      <p>His team, eyeing a record-extending eighth consecutive Bundesliga title, are also busy in midweek, playing Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League, though the Germans have already secured their knockout stage spot.</p>
      <p>Union stunned Gladbach with a 15th minute goal from Anthony Ujah and completed a memorable win with Sebastian Andersson’s goal in second-half stoppage time for a third straight victory which lifted them to 11th on 16 points.</p>
      <p>Second-placed Leipzig easily beat Cologne thanks to Emil Forsberg’s double and goals from Timo Werner and Konrad Laimer.</p>
      <p>Freiburg are fourth on 22 after a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen and stayed ahead on goal difference of Schalke 04, 2-1 winners at Werder Bremen. Borussia Dortmund rescued a 3-3 draw with Paderborn on Friday to stay sixth on 20. — Reuters</p>
