      <p>Dr. Govind Hande, Ex-Technical Officer Agriculture Dept. Pune said earlier India was doing trade with only 11 or 12 countries but after inception of WTO we can trade with more the 190 countries. Every country is very cautious about quality of goods being supplied to them. India is second largest exported of rice in the world, producers of agro produces should explore these opportunities for better returns. Government is promoting the policy of doubling the income of farmers in which cluster based ventures are being encouraged. Farmers should adopt systematic farming approach in cultivation &amp; marketing of locally grown crops. There are huge opportunities in export of fruits &amp; vegetables, as of now we are exporting around 8 % of total demand.</p>
      <p>He said we are importing various commodities which are being cultivated in our country. We should plant to grow the standard commodities in large quantity. Our domestic market is also very large which can be catered, Branding of such standardized produces should be done. Almost all major district have land, rail &amp; air connectivity &amp; now Samruddhi Mahamarg is coming in our state which strengthen the transit of goods to major cities &amp; ports. These amenities will be highly beneficial for agri businesses. Maharashtra has 26 GI tags and number 1 in the country. Every country has their quarantine standards &amp; it also applicable on produces &amp; countries have right to reject that imported material if it is infected with some decease. Residue free produces are demanded by customers in domestic &amp; international market.</p>
