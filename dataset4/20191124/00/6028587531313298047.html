      <p>During peak travel times like Thanksgiving, airline lounges can quite literally be shining oases in the desolate, packed deserts that are US airports today. But it is precisely at such peak travel times that weary passengers can get turned away from lounges, told there’s no room at the inn.This was my experience on Thursday, November 21, at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX.) That day, fully aware of the challenges we faced, my wife and I jumped into the pool of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2019/11/13/travel-tips-from-tsa-for-biggest-thanksgiving-airport--crowds-ever/#11af659a44e3">Thanksgiving travel madness. </a>This year was predicted to produce the busiest of busy times at the airport. Indeed, our flight to JFK, for our mission of visiting our sons in New York and New Jersey, was totally booked.</p>
      <p>Knowing that the holiday crush would only be exacerbated by the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2019/11/14/learning-to-love-laxit-las-confusing-new-bus-to-rideshare--system/#56ba037b4985">zoo that Los Angeles International Airport</a> has become, we departed three hours early for our twenty-mile Lyft ride.</p>
      <p>The freeway and airport roadway were packed with cars, but somehow we beat the odds, arriving at LAX more than two hours before our Alaska Airlines flight to JFK was to board. We checked in, handed off much of our luggage, and headed off to the Alaska Lounge in Terminal 6.</p>
      <p>Alaska has some great <a href="https://www.alaskaair.com/content/airport-lounge">lounges</a>. So holiday visions of hot food, free coffee, WiFi, newspapers, television, a more-private toilet, and above all, a comfortable place to relax before our flight danced in my head.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, lounges have only been open to the big spenders flying First or Business Class. But though we were booked in economy, I held a trump card: my <a href="https://www.prioritypass.com/">Priority Pass</a> Select membership.</p>
      <p>The Priority Pass promises access to “1,000+ airport lounges worldwide” after enrollment. It was one of the travel benefits that came with my <a href="https://www.chase.com/card-benefits/sapphirereserve/travel">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> card (annual fee $450) and some other high-end cards.</p>

      <p>But when we arrived at the elevator to the Alaska Lounge, a sign warned, “Due to Capacity we are not able take Priority Pass holders or Lounge Club at this time. Only can accommodate Alaska Lounge members, First Class on Alaska and Admirals club members and Qantas members. Please come up and we can add you to our waitlist.”</p>
      <p>Another couple surveyed the sign. They said, “This happened to us last week,” as they walked away. Indeed, I’ve heard of this happening at various airline lounges around the world. But I chose to take a shot and took the elevator upstairs. We were barely able to get our luggage out of the elevator, as travelers clutching their bags waited in a line three deep at the counter.</p>
      <p>A woman stepped into what appeared to be a packed lounge completely full of travelers slumped in every available seat. She turned back towards one of the clerks and said, “Excuse me, but you’re a very nasty person.” Another passenger on the line and I made eye contact, wondering whether the woman had had an encounter or was simply entitled.</p>
      <p>When I finally reached the desk the clerks were friendly and professional. They took my cell number and promised to text when my place in line was reached. While my wife used the restroom, I pushed my way back to the elevator. I rode down to the general population level with another PriorityPass passenger, who said she had also been previously turned away.</p>
      <p>When my wife joined me downstairs, she reported that she’d tried to get a cup of coffee for me in the lounge, but the line was too long. Ultimately we did get a text inviting us to the lounge, but by the time it arrived we were sitting on the plane.</p>
      <p>What happened? The Chase Sapphire cards have become extremely popular because of features like generous helpings of points, a $300 payback of travel costs, and benefits like PriorityPass.</p>
      <p>In fact, the Sapphire program may have <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/chase-sapphire-card-perks-costing-company-millions-jpm/">affected both Chase’s bottom line</a> and its relationship with its airline partners. United executives <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/the-chase-sapphire-credit-card-a-victim-of-its-own-success/">reportedly</a> told JPMorgan they thought the Sapphire Reserve card was competing with the airline’s branded cards and siphoning off customer spending.</p>
      <p>Still, the Sapphire Reserve program is clearly delivering for Chase. As of 2018, Chase claimed <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/chase-reveals-data-behind-sapphire-reserve-card/">average income of cardholders</a> was pegged at $180,000, their average FICO score was around 785, and average annual sales volume, or spending on the card, was $39,000. The sales active rate (the percentage of cards in actual use) hovered around 96%, as consumer continued to vote for the card with their checkbooks, as it had a 90% renewal rate.</p>
      <p>But for travelers, the very success of the card appears to have created competition to use the lounge benefit. It’s also possible that the rebate of the $100 Global Entry fee offered by Chase Sapphire Reserve and <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/things-to-know-global-entry/">other credit cards</a> helped fuel the boom in Global Entry applications and subsequent delays in TSA processing.</p>
      <p>It’s often said the devil is in the details. Why were Thanksgiving travelers turned away from the lounge? Simply examine the fine print of the <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/sapphire/reserve/offer-details">Chase Sapphire Reserve offer</a>. Deep in the section under Priority Pass Select Membership, it states, “Access may be denied if the lounge is at capacity.”</p>
      <p>So neither the airline, the lounge, PriorityPass or Chase Sapphire were denying us a promised or paid-for service. Nonetheless, getting turned away was a bummer. I could really have used that cup of coffee.</p>
