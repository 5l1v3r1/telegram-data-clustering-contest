        <b>Salem Al-Dawsari and Bafetimbi Gomis were the heroes as Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal beat Urawa Red Diamonds 2-0 on Sunday and 3-0 on aggregate to claim a record-equalling third Asian club title in the AFC Champions League.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Al-Dawsari scored with 16 minutes left and top-scorer Gomis grabbed his 11th of the competition in injury time as the Saudi giants <b>ended a 19-year wait for their third continental trophy</b>, joining South Korea's Pohang Steelers as the only three-time Asian champions.</p>
      <p>Al Hilal, beaten by Japan's Urawa in the 2017 final, also became the competition's first West Asian winners since Qatar's Al Sadd in 2011, torpedoing a run of victories by clubs from Japan, South Korea, China and Australia.</p>
      <p>Al Hilal had the better of the opening half as they looked to build on their 1-0 win in the first leg, when Andre Carrillo scored the only goal.</p>
      <p>Both goalkeepers were forced into action early on, but it was Urawa's Takahiro Sekine who had the <b>best chance of the half</b> when his point-blank volley was scrambled away by Hilal custodian Abdullah Al-Mayoof.</p>
      <p>After the break tournament top-scorer Gomis, with 10 goals en route to the final, drew a reaction save from Shuzaku Nishikawa when he connected with a menacing cross at the near post.</p>

      <p>Gomis found Nishikawa in his path once again when he chested down Sebastian Giovinco's cross and side-footed his volley <b>straight at the Urawa goalkeeper.</b></p>
      <p>However, they were ominous signs for the hosts and Al Hilal finally prised open the Urawa defence with a <b>sweeping move on 74 minutes</b>.</p>
      <p>Man-of-the-match Giovinco provided the final ball for Salem who gratefully prodded home the winner after a sequence of passes that caught out the backpedalling Urawa defenders.</p>
      <p>Gomis came within inches of connecting with a diving header in the dying moments, but the towering forward was not to be <b>denied later as he smashed in Al Hilal's second in the third minute of injury time.</b></p>
      <p>The Saudi giants have endured a <b>continental trophy drought since 2000</b> when they won the tournament for the second time, the first being in 1991 when it was called the Asian Club Championship.</p>
      <p>They came close in 2014 and 2017 when they reached the final, only to be beaten by Western Sydney Wanderers and Urawa respectively.</p>
