      <p>As Baby Boomers keep working, its changing what retirement looks like. <br/><br/>A new report from Glassdoor, Job and Hiring Trends for 2020, says Baby Boomers will be the fastest-growing age group in the U.S. and U.K. in 2020. <br/><br/>Additionally, a new TD Ameritrade survey of 2,000 adults between 40 and 79 found one in three have or expect to have a job during what would typically be retirement years. <br/><br/>Rather than retire at age 65, more older Americans are remaining in or returning to the workforce due to longer life expectancies, health expenses or financial insecurity. Others simply enjoy the social interaction, or the fulfillment and sense of identity work provides. <br/>Two-thirds of adults ages 54 to 64 were working in 2018, and three in 10 of those 65 to 72 were working or looking for work, according to Pew Research Center data. <br/><br/>While other age groups are expected to experience little change in labor force participation through 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said in 2017 its increasing fastest for those ages 65 to 74 and 75 and older, per CNBC Make It. <br/><br/>In many cases, Baby Boomers are concerned they wont have enough saved to support themselves later in life. About 43 percent of those 45 and older believe theyll outlive their retirement savings, per a recent Axios-SurveyMonkey poll. <br/><br/>Its a concern among Gen X, too: More than half of those ages 35 to 54 expect to outlive their retirement savings, that poll found. Another study indicated more than half of women worry about this. <br/><br/>Six in 10 unretirees are bolstering their savings due to longer life expectancy, by cutting back their expenses, securing life insurance or increasing their contributions to retirement accounts, TD Ameritrade found.</p>
