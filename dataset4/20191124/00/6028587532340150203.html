      <p><i>“‘But he hasn't got anything on!’ the whole town cried out at last. The Emperor shivered, for he suspected they were right. But he thought, ‘This procession has got to go on.’ So he walked more proudly than ever, as his noblemen held high the train that wasn't there at all.” </i>–Hans Christian Andersen: <a href="https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheEmperorsNewClothes_e.html">“The Emperor’s New Clothes</a>” (1837)Five days of impeachment hearings have showed that the U.S. president directed his cabinet, ambassadors and others to corrupt the presidency and use hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money, appropriated by Congress, to solicit a bribe from a foreign country to help him win the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>While the exact articles remain to be formulated, impeachment by the House is now inevitable and a trial in the Senate looms. Yet Republican congressmen and senators continue to support the president, maintain that he should not be impeached and act as though nothing is amiss. They now find themselves in the same predicament as the courtiers in Hans Christian Andersen’s famous fairy tale, <i>“</i>The Emperor’s New Clothes” when the Emperor continued to parade before them, together with his noblemen, without any clothes. At some point, the pretense has to end. But when?</p>
      <p>
        <b>In The House: Case Closed</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Wednesday November 20, the impeachment testimony of the incongruously genial E.U Ambassador Gordon Sondland made clear that the president’s telephone call on July 25 asking for “a favor” from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was not a momentary aberration: it was part of an elaborate scheme executed over several months by Sondland, Trump’s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and the acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. It was a scheme in which the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice-President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and others were “in the loop” and which they took no public action to stop. (The offices of Pence, Pompeo and Perry have all issued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/20/what-trump-pence-pompeo-others-knew-according-gordon-sondlands-testimony-texts-emails/?arc404=true">denials</a>.)</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The headlines of newspapers around the country following this testimony were unanimous in declaring its importance with screaming headlines:</p>
      <p>·       <i>New York Times</i>: “’WE FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT’S ORDERS’”</p>
      <p>·       <i>Washington Post</i>: “Diplomat acknowledges ‘quid pro quo”</p>
      <p>·       <i>Wall Street Journal</i>: “Envoy Says Trump Directed effort”</p>
      <p>·       <i>USA Today</i>: “Everyone Was In The Loop”</p>
      <p>·       <i>Financial Times</i>: “Sondland ‘followed’ orders from Trump on Ukraine ‘quid pro quo’”</p>
      <p>·       <i>Los Angeles Times</i>: “Sondland implicates president”</p>
      <p>·       <i>The Kansas City Star</i>: “Trump directed pressure on Ukraine, ambassador says”</p>
      <p>·       St Louis Post Dispatch: “IT WAS NO SECRET: EVERYONE WAS IN THE LOOP”</p>
      <p>Republicans consoled themselves with the thought that Sondland gave no evidence of express direction by the president. However, on Thursday November 22, that gap was promptly filled by the State Department aide David Holmes who heard Ambassador call Trump from a restaurant in Kyiv and listened as Trump asked Sondland, “So, he's gonna do the investigation?” and Sondland replied, “He's gonna do it,” adding that President Zelensky will do "anything you ask him to.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conspiracy Theories Outed As Fictions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Also on Thursday, Trump’s former adviser on Russia and Europe Dr. Fiona Hill gave testimony. She depicted the president’s operatives’ efforts to get Ukraine’s new president to investigate his country’s alleged 2016 meddling in the U.S. presidential election as “a domestic political errand.” By contrast, she and her fellow diplomats were “involved in national security and foreign policy.” The interests of the political errand and foreign policy had “diverged.” She presciently told Sondland at the time: “This is all going to blow up.”</p>
      <p>According to Republican columnist Peggy Noonan, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-defenders-have-no-defense-11574382421">Dr Hill</a> is “the kind of woman you don’t want to mess with.” Hill sternly warned Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that, in promoting the fiction that it was Ukraine not Russia that meddled in the U.S. 2016 presidential election, they were serving Russia’s interests and undermining America’s.</p>
      <p>The headlines in newspapers around the country following Thursday’s testimony by Dr Hill were similarly strident:</p>
      <p>·       <i>New York Times</i>: “EXPERT CONDEMNS FLOW OF FICTIONS ON UKRAINE’S ROLE”</p>
      <p>·       <i>St Louis Post Dispatch</i>: “FICTIONAL NARRATIVE”</p>
      <p>·       <i>Tampa Bay Times</i>: “HILL: DISCORD SERVES PUTIN”</p>
      <p>·       Portland Press Herald: “Witness: Fictions About Ukraine Help Russia”</p>
      <p>·       <i>San Antonio Press News</i>: “Election-tampering theory called ‘a fiction’”</p>
      <p>·       <i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</i>: “Expert: Ukraine meddling lie”</p>
      <p>Outside the hearings, it transpired that U.S. intelligence services had already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/ukraine-russia-interference.html">briefed senators</a> that the conspiracy theory about Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election was not only false: it was invented and disseminated by the Kremlin in order to absolve Russia from its meddling in 2016 and to sow discord among Americans. Any Americans disseminating that conspiracy theory were doing Russia’s bidding and undermining America.</p>
      <p>Undaunted, President continued to disseminate the conspiracy theory on Friday November 23 when he made a lengthy call to <i>Fox &amp; Friends. </i>Even the hosts of<i> </i>his loyal fan club <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/22/reality-invades-fox-friends/">felt obliged to ask the president</a> whether the claims about Ukraine’s intervention in the 2016 election were true.</p>
      <p>The president and his supporters continue to complain about the fairness of the process so far, and lament the inability to call witnesses or submit evidence. These complaints need to be evaluated against the background of the president’s explicit efforts to block witnesses from testifying and not allowing documents to be shared–actions which themselves risk constituting a further ground for impeachment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Country Split On Removing The President</b>
      </p>
      <p>Public support for and against impeachment is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/">still evenly split</a> with 46% both for and against impeachment. The split is along party lines, with 80% of Democrats, 41% of independents and 12% of Republicans supporting impeachment and removal.</p>
      <p>There is no sign yet that the impeachment hearings have changed the public’s view as to what should be done. If anything, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/">support among independents</a> for removal appears to have softened slightly. Support for removal of the president is even weaker in swing states like Wisconsin. Republican columnist David Brooks reports from his private conversations with Trump supporters that hardly anyone disputes that “Trump did it”: they just don’t care.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Education Of Peggy Noonan</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yet some thoughtful Republicans are having second thoughts. Back in September 2019, Peggy Noonan was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-set-a-bear-trap-11569539234">skeptical of impeachment</a> “Nobody knows where this is going. The politically obsessed may think they do, but something wild and unpredictable has been let loose.” Democrats, she lamented, “were setting a bear trap for Donald Trump.” Impeaching Trump felt “grubby and small”</p>
      <p>After watching the first day of hearings, Noonan was starting to feel differently. “There was something grave in it, and a kind of reckoning. This was due to the dignity and professionalism of the career diplomats who calmly and methodically told what they had seen and experienced. They were believable. It didn’t feel embarrassing to have faith in them.”</p>
      <p>By contrast, she saw Republicans behaving badly. “Republicans on the panel didn’t know what to do. They know what this story is, and I believe they absolutely know the president muscled an ally, holding public money over its head to get a personal political favor. But they’re his party, they didn’t want to look weak, they had to show the base they had his back.” The Republicans were “sullen, squirrelly, off-point.”</p>
      <p>Noonan was surprised to see that “the Democrats were disciplined in their questioning and not bullying and theatrical…Quietly, smoothly, brick by brick, they gave their testimony and painted a picture that supports the charge that yes, Donald Trump muscled Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>After the fifth day of hearings, Noonan concluded that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-defenders-have-no-defense-11574382421">the game was up</a>. “Look, the case has been made,” she wrote. “Almost everything in the impeachment hearings this week fleshed out and backed up the charge that President Trump muscled Ukraine for political gain. The pending question is what precisely the House and its Democratic majority will decide to include in the articles of impeachment, what statutes or standards they will assert the president violated.”</p>
      <p>“What was said consistently undermined Mr. Trump’s case,” wrote Noonan, “but more deadly was what has never been said. … no one, even in the White House, has said anything like, ‘He wouldn’t do that!’ or ‘That would be so unlike him.’ His best friends know he would do it and it’s exactly like him.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where To From Here?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As impeachment by the House is now virtually certain, the question shifts to what will happen in the Senate. Will the Senate convict? A summary acquittal in the face of all this evidence appears to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-and-republicans-discuss-limiting-impeachment-trial-to-two-weeks/2019/11/21/3e02edf8-0c9a-11ea-a49f-9066f51640f6_story.html">a step too far</a> even for the Republican-controlled Senate. After all, the pattern of misconduct is clear. In 2016 the president invited Russia to investigate his opponent’s emails and welcomed the results of the investigation when he received them. In July 2019, the president told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/id-exclusive-interview-trump-listen-foreigners-offered-dirt/story?id=63669304">his campaign would accept information from foreigners</a> — such as China or Russia — if he received it. Now there is evidence that he actively sought such evidence from another foreign country–Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Yet a lengthy trial with a case this clear is equally unthinkable. “Who exactly will be the president’s witnesses, those who’d testify he didn’t do what he appears to have done, and would never do it?” wondered Noonan. “A full-blown trial [and acquittal] on charges most everyone believes are true will seem absurd to all but diehards and do the country no good.”</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Sadly, there is no sign yet that Republican senators might be considering voting according to their consciences based on an honest assessment of the facts and the risk of the president continuing to seek or welcome further foreign interference in the 2020 election–the very misstep that the Founding Fathers held to be the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/news/2019/09/26/475114/founders-impeached-trump-ukraine-related-misconduct/">quintessential impeachable offense</a>.</p>
      <p>Noonan suggests a way out of the box that Republican senators have built for themselves: the Senate might give the president a slap on the wrist and censure him. In this way, Senators could claim to be addressing Trump’s lawlessness while not enraging Trump’s base.</p>
      <p>Republicans may feel that, like the nobles in Andersen’s fairy tale, “The procession has got to go on” and hope–unrealistically–that no one notices or holds them accountable. As Republicans have already made so many accommodations to a lawless president, they may feel that one more will not make much difference. But if that does happen, the eye of history will not look kindly on their actions. The president is bound to go on messing with the 2020 election and committing more impeachable offenses.</p>
