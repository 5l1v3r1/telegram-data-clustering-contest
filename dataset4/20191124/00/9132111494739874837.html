      <p>Former minister, Seth Emmanuel Terkper, has indicated that the worst performance of his party, NDC, is the NPP's best performance.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a recent public lecture, the Chartered Accountant stated that at the end of NDC’s second term in 2016, which was also John Mahama’s first term as President, Ghana was having only one oil field as compared to three under Akufo-Addo/Bawumia's leadership.</p>
      <p>Therefore, “comparing the performance of the NPP at the end of 2018 to the performance of the NDC at the end of 2016, is comparing our [NDC's] worst to what is supposed to be their [NPP's] best,” he explained.</p>
      <p>He added that in the past not a single drop of Ghana’s crude oil was exported to earn the country foreign exchange.</p>
      <p>But, under the NPP, Mr Terkper explained, the government is earning more than four billion dollars from the three oil fields.</p>
      <p>Thus, Seth Terkper has thrown the challenge of comparison back to NPP by pointing at a new earner which did not exist in the past and which should be factored into the national debate about economic performance Ken Ofori-Atta raised when he presented the 2020 budget to Parliament earlier this month.</p>
