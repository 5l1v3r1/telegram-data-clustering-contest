The list include curator Tarek Abou El Fetouh; professor and Founding Director of NTU CCA Singapore, Ute Meta Bauer; art historian and Cornell University professor, Salah M. Hassan; and art historian and Princeton University professor, Chika Okeke-Agulu.”</p>

      <p>Organised around the title and theme for next year, the event will focus on the 30th anniversary of the Sharjah Biennial, bringing together former curators, artistic directors and artists as well art historians and critics to examine the role of the Biennial in the region and in the global contemporary art scene.</p>
