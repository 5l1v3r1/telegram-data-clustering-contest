      <h1>Amazon to open store on China's Pinduoduo marketplace on November 25: source</h1>

      <p>SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/amazon-com-inc">AMZN</a>) will open a store on Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/pinduoduo">PDD</a>) on Monday, a source familiar with the matter said, in a sign of how the U.S. firm's China strategy is evolving after it shut its own online store in the country.</p>
      <p>Amazon closed its Chinese marketplace in July, having found it difficult to gain traction in the face of intense competition from entrenched, home-grown rivals like Alibaba Group Holding's (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/alibaba">BABA</a>) Tmall marketplace and JD.com (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/jd.com-inc-adr">JD</a>).</p>
      <p>It said at the time it would increase its focus on selling goods from abroad to Chinese buyers via its global platform. It also has a Kindle store on Tmall.</p>
      <p>Alibaba and JD.com have traditionally dominated China's e-commerce market but that status quo was recently disrupted by four-year-old Pinduoduo, which is popular with China's lower-tier city residents.</p>
      <p>The source said Amazon's Pinduoduo store would carry goods from overseas.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Pinduoduo declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Pinduoduo, which woos customers with deep discounts and group buying deals, suffered an $11 billion slump in value last week after it posted a much wider-than-expected quarterly loss that stemmed from its efforts to fight its rivals with heavy subsidies.</p>
