        <b>Jose Mourinho took the reigns at Tottenham after Mauricio Pochettino's sacking. However, the 'Daily Star' revealed that there were options. This British newspaper states that Roberto Martinez, who is the Belgium national team coach, offered to take charge after the Argentine's exit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has been a crazy last few days in London. <b>Mauricio Pochettino</b>'s sacking shook everyone in the football world and he was replaced by <b>Jose Mourinho.</b>  A movement that took place in a matter of hours, but which also made all the headlines.</p>
      <p>According to the 'Daily Star', there were other candidates to take charge of the team after Pochettino's exit. The British media state that one of those was no other than Belgium coach<b> Roberto Martinez. </b></p>
      <p>As the newspaper explains, 46-year-old Martinez contacted <b>Daniel Levy</b> and the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> board <b>to offer his services</b> after they said goodbye to the Argentine.</p>

      <p>Martinez gets a rest in the next few weeks after sealing their ticket to the<b> Euro 2020 with Belgium</b>, although after three years in charge of the national team, it seems that he has a desire to return to coaching football clubs. </p>
      <p>This offer speaks for itself about Roberto Martinez's willingness to coach a new team, beyond that can combine it with his national team, which he led to <b>the semifinal of the World Cup in Russia,</b> where they lost against<b> France.</b></p>
      <p>Roberto Martínez's last club experience was at <b>Everton</b>, which he kept in Europe after <b>David Moyes</b>'s departure between 2013 and 2016. His two other stints as a club coach were in <b>Swansea</b> (2007-2009), where he was promoted to the Premier League, and <b>Wigan Athletic</b> (2009-2013).</p>
