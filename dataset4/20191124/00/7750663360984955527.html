      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-to-open-talks-over-zaniolo-deal_380198.html">it was claimed</a> that United wanted to hold talks with Roma over a potential move for Zaniolo, who has scored three times in his last four Serie A appearances.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils could allegedly use the Italian club's interest in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-smalling/"><b>Chris Smalling</b></a>, who is currently on loan at Stadio Olimpico, in a bid to beat a number of clubs to the 20-year-old's signature.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Il Messaggero</i>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a>'s side have signalled that they would be prepared to pay as much as £52m in order to secure a deal for the former Inter Milan attacker.</p>
      <p>The report claims that the 20-time English champions could face competition from Paris Saint-Germain, though, with the French champions also huge admirers of the youngster.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo has contributed two goals in five caps for the Italian national team.</p>
