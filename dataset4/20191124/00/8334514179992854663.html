      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in a Maryland hospital after suffering from chills and a fever, but is expected to be released on Sunday, the Supreme Court said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has faced several health scares over the past year, including in August, when she underwent radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, began experiencing the symptoms earlier on Friday. She went to a hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for more evaluations and treatment of any possible infection, the court said.</p>
      <p>But the justiceâ€™s symptoms have abated after antibiotics and fluids and she is expected to be released from the hospital on Sunday morning, the court said.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg is the oldest justice on the court. Her health is closely watched because a Supreme Court vacancy would give President Donald Trump the opportunity to appoint a third justice to the nine-member court and prod it further to the right.</p>
      <p>Last December, Ginsburg had two cancerous nodules removed from her left lung, and has previously been treated for pancreatic cancer in 2009 and colon cancer in 1999.</p>
