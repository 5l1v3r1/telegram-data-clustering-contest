      <p>Meek Mill is partnering up with Lids for a good cause. The rapper is launching his first collaboration with an exclusive, limited-edition DreamChasers cap. The 9FIFTY hat design includes a white-embroidered “DC” Dreamchasers logo on the front, a "For Motivational Use Only" message on the right side and “Dream Chasers” on the back of the snapback. He initially teased the design during his Motivation U.S. Tour, a 15-date trek that stopped in Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and ultimately concluded in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"Having my own line with LIDS is special, but I'm especially proud that proceeds from this hat will be used to help fix the broken criminal justice system," Meek says. "I'm grateful that our team at LIDS was committed to making a hat that's stylish, but will go toward a greater cause."</p>
      <p>Meek, who is the co-owner of Lids, and the brand will donate a percentage of the proceeds to REFORM Alliance, which is dedicated to criminal justice reform in the United States. He co-founded the initiative with Michael Rubin, JAY-Z, Robert Kraft, Robert F. Smith, Clara Wu Tsai, Laura Arnold, Michael Novogratz, and Daniel S. Loeb. The organization’s goal is to reduce the number of people trapped in the system by implementing policy and law changes. </p>
      <p>The Philadelphia native struggled with the criminal justice system, which stemmed from a 2007 arrest. The case came to a close this past August when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge. He dealt with probation and appeals for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>Meek Mill has garnered two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 albums chart, including his latest album release <i>Championships</i>. </p>
      <p>The limited-edition red DreamChasers cap will be available at Lids stores on Tuesday. </p>
