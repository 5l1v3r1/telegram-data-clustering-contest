      <p>The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, will hold a live broadcast today, Sunday, November 24, where he would discuss the Hate Speech Bill currently at the Nigerian Senate.</p>
      <p>Kanu’s proposed live broadcast which will hold on Radio Biafra by 7 pm Nigerian time, may not be unconnected with the death penalty clause in the proposed National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill introduced by Senator Sabi Abdullah, the Deputy Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the bill in a tweet on the micro-blogging site, Twitter, Kanu said he would use his broadcast later today to “remind the world of the originator of hate speech in Nigerian politics.”</p>
      <p>The IPOB leader said he would also use the broadcast to discuss the betrayal of trust of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe as well as the fraud case of Allen Onyema, the Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace in United States.</p>
      <p>Kanu also revealed that referendum in Ethiopia will be discussed during the broadcast.</p>
      <p>The secessionist leader tweeted: “Tonight on Radio Biafra, I will remind the world of the originator of hate speech in Nigerian politics; the treachery of Dr Azikiwe &amp; Allen Onyema’s imbroglio including a referendum in Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>“7 pm Biafraland Time.Via Radio Biafra App &amp; FM,” Kanu tweeted.</p>
