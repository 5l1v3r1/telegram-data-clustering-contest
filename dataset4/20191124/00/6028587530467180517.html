      <p>FC Barcelona went into Saturday’s tie at Leganes level on points with Real Madrid and leading La Liga by a mere +2 goal difference. Against the bottom-ranked home side, they had the perfect chance to open the gap in this aspect and Ernesto Valverde had smelled blood by fielding an interesting 4-2-3-1 formation.</p>
      <p>This meaning that an attacking midfield of Antoine Griezmann, Lionel Messi and Ousmane Dembélé were placed behind sole striker Luis Suarez up top, the ‘MSGD’ quartet was born and the floodgates were predicted to burst open.</p>
      <p>While Madrid trounced this opposition 5-0 at home just over three weeks ago, though, Barça, as we know, are a different animal away from the Camp Nou. Rather than racking goals up at will, they found themselves one down after 12 minutes when Youseff En-Nesyri struck a peach into Marc-Andre Ter Stegen’s top corner.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi finishing the first half without a single shot to speak of, the Argentine failed to prolong his five-game scoring streak but later became pivotal in the equaliser.</p>
      <p>Brought down seven minutes after the interval, the resulting free kick was too far out to be ‘Messi range’ yet didn’t prevent him from finding Luis Suarez to head home with a pinpoint ping into the box.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Antoine Griezmann enjoyed another miserable afternoon at Butarque and did not perk up even when put out of his left wing nightmare once switching flanks with compatriot Dembélé.</p>
      <p>Brought off in a double substitution with Sergio Busquets for Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal before the hour mark, it was the latter player, and neither of the mentioned three attackers nor the subsequently-introduced Ansu Fati, that decided the tie.</p>
      <p>When Dembélé planted an inswinging corner into the box 11 minutes from time, Vidal capatalised on Ruben Perez’s knock on and smashed the winner into the roof of the net to seal not just the comeback, but also another three points that kept the Blaugrana at summit.</p>
      <p>Yet it is not just the fact Barça made such hard work of beating lowly Leganes that should be a concern to Ernesto Valverde and his men.</p>
      <p>Worryingly, they have managed just one goal from open play in their last seven scored, with the rest coming from a variety of set pieces.</p>
      <p>Beginning with Messi’s penalty in the 3-1 away defeat to Levante, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner scored a dead ball hat trick against Celta Vigo that contained two stunning free kicks and one from the spot to match the aforementioned efforts on Saturday by his colleagues.</p>
      <p>In that 4-1 win, Sergio Busquets notched his first in 769 days with a bouncing shot and this is worrying for an outfit that has a packed schedule of eight games in 29 days heading into the end of the year.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, when hosting a Borussia Dortmund side in the Champions League that leaked three against domestic minnows Paderborn prior to salvaging a 3-3 draw, Barcelona will look to overturn this unwanted statistic and not just rely on the dead ball expertise of Lionel Messi or confusion in the penalty area to put them on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>After all, their number one spot in Group F, as well as that in the Spanish table, could depend on it.</p>
