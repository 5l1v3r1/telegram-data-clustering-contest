        <b>WASHINGTON (CMC) — The Caribbean Community (Caricom) has defended the electoral system in the 15-member grouping even as the United States sought to condemn the decision of Dominica not to invite the Organisation of American States (OAS) to observe its December 6 General Election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Opposition parties in Dominica have been calling for electoral reform ahead of the polls, but the Roosevelt Skerrit Administration said it had been stymied by Opposition legislators who refused to debate the necessary legislation needed to advance the electoral reform process.</p>
      <p>Dominica's Foreign and Caricom Affairs Minister Francine Baron on Friday said that Dominica had never had any instance of fraudulent elections since it attained political independence from Britain in 1978 and that both the ruling Dominica Labour Party and the main Opposition United Workers Party (UWP) had won elections on the island using the present system.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the Caricom, St Lucia's ambassador to the OAS, Anton Edmund, said “all electoral reform is complex.</p>
      <p>“We welcome efforts at electoral reform within the framework of the governing principles and processes provided for in the constitution of any member state. The framework for democracy and the practices of its principles exist in Dominica including freedom of assembly and expression,” the diplomat said.</p>
      <p>“We expect all parties will act within the rule of law and respect for the constitutional order. We note there is no deadly or widespread violence as Dominica prepares to hold elections within the current provisions of its constitution.”</p>
      <p>Edmund said that the Caribbean has always had “strong tradition of democracy, notably free and fair elections”, adding that considering previous electoral missions in the region “we know and are confident that the Organisation of American States as an institution understand this.</p>
      <p>“We encourage impartiality,” he said, adding “there must be the recognition that there are a number of highly credible bodies that observe elections and the Commonwealth of Dominica has invited four of them to observe its own elections.</p>
      <p>“There is no obligation for any member state to invite the OAS,” Edmund said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, Baron said that in the interest of transparency and good governance to extend invitations to Caricom, the Commonwealth, the United Nations and the Carter Centre to observe and to participate in its electoral process.</p>
      <p>“We note the suggestion that the OAS should be invited to observe the election and we also note that there are countries in this hemisphere that have chosen not to invite the OAS to observe its election, including some of the most recent concluded elections of some of our member states around this table,” Baron said.</p>
      <p>But the US ambassador to the OAS, Carlos Trujillo, expressed his country's disappointment at the OAS not being invited to participate in the elections, saying that the OAS has had a record of promoting free and fair elections throughout the hemisphere.</p>
      <p>“We strongly believe …that democracy is the foundation for peace and stability in the region,” he said, adding that Washington promotes elections that reflect the will of the people.</p>
      <p>“We appreciate Foreign Minister Baron's explanation of the government's reasons calling elections and the reasons why the various election reforms have not been implemented. We have also heard from Opposition leaders in Dominica who have had much different explanations why the election reforms were not being implemented”.</p>
      <p>He said the United States believes it is critical that the people of Dominica “have full confidence that the December 6 elections are free and fair”.</p>
      <p>He said given the sensitives around the electoral process “we urge both sides to refrain from actions that can be perceived as detrimental to the integrity of the democratic process,” reiterating a call for the OAS to be invited to monitor the poll.</p>
