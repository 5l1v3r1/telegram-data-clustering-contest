      <p>CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian media outlet critical of the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi says plainclothes police have raided its headquarters in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cairo/">Cairo</a>.</p>
      <p>Mada Masr, one of a shrinking number of independent news websites in Egypt, reported the raid in a tweet Sunday. It says: “Staff are currently being held inside, and their phones have been switched off.” It was unclear how many people were inside the office.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman was not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>The raid came a day after Mada said security forces detained one of its editors, Shady Zalat, at his home in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cairo/">Cairo</a> early Saturday.</p>

        <p>Mada Masr, which publishes critical reports about the government and security agencies, is one of hundreds of websites blocked by the Egyptian government in recent years.</p>
