      <p>FAIRFAX COUNTY, Va. (AP) - Firefighters in Virginia are taking part in a study aimed at finding ways to reduce their exposure to carcinogens.</p>
      <p>WTOP-FM reports that the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department is partnering with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-fire-protection-association/">National Fire Protection Association</a> Research Foundation on a four-phase study. Part of the focus of the study will be on how chemicals can cling to breathing equipment used by firefighters.</p>
      <p>Firefighters are exposed to toxic chemicals released into the air by burning buildings and vehicles. According to a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study, firefighters are twice as likely to get skin and testicular cancer and mesothelioma.</p>
