      <h1>Virtual Wellbeing is a Reality - And It Is Proving Effective</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Colleen Reilly</a></address>
      <p>Seventy percent of Americans are overweight or obese, and for the first time in history, more people are obese (40 percent) than overweight (30 percent). These individuals are at increased risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and many other health conditions that are avoidable, preventable, and even reversible through positive lifestyle choices.</p>
      <p>Although 80 percent of employers offer wellness programs, results do not meet expectations. It is time for an innovative technology that helps people optimize their health and wellbeing and that is where, within the current "4<sup>th</sup> Industrial Revolution"*, Virtual Wellbeing becomes a reality.</p>
      <p>Virtual Worlds share many of the strengths of Virtual Reality technologies, specifically the rendering of 3D spaces. However, Virtual Reality research has largely involved costly and sophisticated head-mounted displays and goggles, which result in an immersive experience from a first-person perspective. </p>
      <p>Today there is an increased interest and demand, and 3D Virtual Worlds are growing and eliminating the need for expensive head-mounted displays, instead requiring only access to a laptop or tablet, thereby making it more accessible and affordable for employers, participants and providers. </p>
      <p>Virtual Worlds for healthcare and wellness also possess affordances that differentiate them (to varying degrees) from current wellness web-based engagement technologies. The current web-based wellness interventions can reach a lot of people, but they typically miss some important aspect of human (social) interaction and thus fall short of delivering a truly engaging experience or effective learning environment.</p>
      <p>Virtual World technology has overcome this challenge through more direct support, more engagement, and active learning based on research, education, and behavioral theories. The Virtual World is effective because it is persistent, it supports social inter-activities and connectedness, and the notion of “being there” becomes “doing there.”  </p>
      <p>Participants act within the Virtual World using an avatar—a digital representation of self, customizable so a user can portray an actual or desired self-image. When the participant creates an avatar, a phenomenon called the Proteus effect** occurs, and the participant shifts their behavior in accordance with their digital representation. Stanford Virtual Interaction Laboratory Studies show that when people are observing their own avatar running, they will run longer in subsequent exercises.</p>
      <p>Moreover, 2012 research done by Johnston, J. D., Massey, A. P., &amp; DeVaneaux, C. A. illuminated underpinnings that make Virtual Worlds effective. They are<i> persistent </i>(continuing to exist even when users are not logged in), and they support <i>social </i>interactivity and connectedness through a multi-player environment.</p>
      <p>Since individuals can be influenced by others, social interactivity may promote positive behaviors via emotional (e.g., encouragement) or informational (e.g., advice or knowledge) support. Virtual World users experience a sense of<i> presence</i>—the feeling of being there in the virtual place rather than in the physical space where one’s body is really located. The notion of being<i> </i>there is also enhanced by the possibility of doing<i> </i>there which is a necessary condition for active learning. </p>
      <p>A simple analogy would be to call this the Disney World of wellness. It offers highly interactive 3D spaces, including a physical wellbeing island with a restaurant, a mini-mart convenience store, an encouragement room, creative educational tools (a nutritional jeopardy game and a fire pit illustrating how the body uses food as fuel), as well as over 30 movement activities (bikes and bike paths, surfing, exercise balls, lap swim, basketball, weight lifting, yoga, dancing, and rock climbing), and numerous healthy habits tools (tracking charts). </p>
      <p>All elements are intended to engage participants in social networking, play, and learning. For example, the restaurant area is designed for use as a practice area for nutrition planning. It has an interactive menu that displays a full selection of items that a participant might encounter during a restaurant outing. The menu works on a stoplight (red, yellow, green) model, and participants are asked to choose what they believe are the healthiest choices. The menu responds to their selection with the color appropriate to their selection and an explanation as to why this menu item was ranked at that color, as well as ways to make the item healthier. Topics discussed are hidden calories, eating out, and portion control.</p>
      <p>At the same time, social support is available anytime as participants can reflect on the past week's activities and social bonds. These social support classes take place in the pool, at the campfire on the beach at sunset, and while performing yoga poses. It is designed to provide an environment that closely mirrors the physical world. It sets up learning situations that incorporate practicing new behaviors like throwing away 3D food, addressing the “food pushers” and non-supportive people in their lives, and the social influences of work environments. </p>
      <p>Research supports and provides essential insights to how Virtual Worlds are effective learning environments for behavior modification, specifically weight loss and weight maintenance. This technology is showing signs that it may not only help with the costliest health epidemic nationally, but could also help relieve the spread of the global obesity epidemic.</p>
