          <i>Cairo,</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Independent news outlet Mada Masr said Egyptian police arrested one of its editors on Saturday, amid an ongoing security crackdown.</p>
      <p>Shady Zalat, 37, has worked since 2014 at the prominent website, which publishes investigations into corruption and security issues in Arabic and English.</p>
      <p>Police raided Zalat's Cairo apartment without showing an arrest warrant, Mada Masr said.</p>
      <p>Officers told his wife Zalat was being taken to the capital's Giza security directorate but Mada Masr was unable to confirm his whereabouts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SISI'S SON</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Zalat's arrest comes after Mada Masr published an article last week alleging that President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi's son Mahmoud had been transferred to Moscow on a diplomatic posting.</p>
      <p>His re-assignment from a senior intelligence post came after he had been criticised internally within the security apparatus, Mada Masr reported.</p>
      <p>The article, which cited unnamed Emirati and Egyptian officials, gave details about the country's security agencies at a time when press freedoms in Egypt are shrinking.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if Zalat worked on the piece.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CRACKDOWN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since Sisi led the military ouster of former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, a crackdown has targeted journalists alongside dissidents and activists.</p>
      <p>Since small-scale protests in September made rare calls for Sisi's removal, authorities have arrested some 4,000 people.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations were triggered by viral videos posted online by an exiled businessman in Spain accusing the military's top brass of rampant corruption.</p>
      <p>Egypt jails more journalists than any other country except China and Turkey, according to New York-based watchdog Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
      <p>Mada Masr is one of hundreds of websites blocked by Egyptian authorities in recent years and can only be accessed domestically via a virtual private network (VPN) application.</p>
      <p>The publication called for Zalat's "immediate and unconditional release".</p>
