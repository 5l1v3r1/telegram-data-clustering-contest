      <h4>Several boats, a helicopter and police divers were deployed to the northern German city after reports of a person drowning in the Elbe River. The apparent victim was, however, a seal, happily splashing in the water.</h4>
      <p>A rescue operation was triggered in the northern German city of Hamburg on Sunday after a jogger spotted what he thought was a drowning person.</p>
      <p>The local fire department deployed several boats, a helicopter and a diving team to the cool waters of the Elbe River. An ambulance and the police were also at the scene.</p>
      <p>But they were unable to find any trace of the struggling swimmer, following the reports of someone struggling to swim near the Teufelsbrück (Devil's bridge) jetty.</p>

      <p>The jogger who had left the scene was asked to return to pinpoint exactly where he had spotted the flailing person. But no human could be found.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Happy ending</b>
      </p>
      <p>Instead, rescuers found a seal happily splashing around in the water.</p>

      <p>The mammal appeared repeatedly and seemed to be watching the rescue operation unfold, the <i>Hamburg Morgenpost</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Sunday's incident wasn't the first time that seals were spotted in the northern port city this year.</p>
      <p>Several other sightings have taken place on the shores of the Elbe, which one local animal shelter explained was often due to pup seals getting separated from their mothers.</p>
