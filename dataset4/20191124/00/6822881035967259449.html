      <p>iBanFirst is instigating an international expansion plan following a $17 million venture round in November 2018.</p>
      <p>NBWM, a foreign exchange firm based in the Netherlands which claims more than 1,000 clients, will deploy iBanFirst’s online platform.</p>
      <p>Both companies will operate under the iBanFirst brand and iBanFirst will use NBWM’s Amsterdam office until mid-2020. NBWM clients will receive the “same quality of service” but will now be able to take advantage of nominative IBANs, hedging solutions a “user-friendly interface”.</p>
      <p>“We were the first disruptors in the Dutch market, like iBanFirst was in France and Belgium,” says PJ Datema, founder of NBWM.</p>
      <p>“Together with iBanFirst we are looking forward to taking the whole organisation to the next level with a state-of-the-art technology platform and a service-oriented sales force. It is a big step forward into the future.”</p>
      <p>Pierre-Antoine Dusoulier, CEO and founder of iBanFirst, adds: “I have known PJ Datema and Peter Comstock for a long time. We have worked together at Saxo Bank and they started focusing on businesses’ international payment issues at the same time as us. I was very impressed with what they have accomplished in the Netherlands. NBWM counts, in particular, highly skilled technical teams who have met the needs of very specialised clients.”</p>
