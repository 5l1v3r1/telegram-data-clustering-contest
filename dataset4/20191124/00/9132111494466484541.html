      <p>A Deputy Minister of Local Government and Rural Development, Osei Bonsu Amoah, says it was the then Majority in Parliament which wanted a referendum before an amendment to the constitution for the election of MMDCEs.</p>
      <p>He said deliberations on the election of metropolitan, municipal and district chief executives (MMDCEs) have begun for quite some time now with the two major political parties in absolute agreement.</p>
      <p>He told Abena Tabi on TV3’s The Key Points on Saturday, November 23 that the two parties agreed that the amendment should be effected.</p>
      <p>He said when deliberations on Article 24.3.1 to take away the powers of the president came up in Parliament in July, 2010, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) members wanted a referendum first.</p>
      <p>“Our friends on the Majority said we should go for a referendum,” he disclosed, mentioning the likes of Haruna Iddrisu, Alhaji Muntaka Mohammed and Mahama Ayariga as proponents of the referendum.</p>
      <p>He said it therefore comes as strange for the party to take a U-turn.</p>
