      <p>The shareholders of Waste Connections Inc. demonstrated that one female director on a corporate board is, in their eyes, no longer enough.</p>
      <p>The company, a member of the S&amp;P/TSX 60, faced a shareholder proposal this spring from the British Columbia Teachers’ Federation calling on it to release a formal, written diversity policy, as well as plans and timelines for increasing the number of female board members and executives.</p>
      <p>It passed with support from 64 per cent of the shareholders. Law firm Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg LLP says it’s the first time in Canadian history that a shareholder proposal on gender diversity has passed. It was the only shareholder proposal of any kind to pass among the 62 in Canada studied by Davies in 2019.</p>
      <p>Waste Connections came to its shareholders in the spring with one woman among its seven directors. Proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended a Yes vote, contrary to Waste Connections’ wishes, saying it lagged Canadian companies in female representation and the company disclosed neither a formal gender policy nor a target to fix that.</p>
      <p>In an interview, chief financial officer Mary Anne Whitney said Waste Connections was looking for an additional board member at the time of the annual meeting and later added a woman, making two of its eight members female. “We had identified that diversity, specifically gender diversity, was one of the factors that should be considered. That was a priority for us.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Whitney declined to comment on the status of a formal diversity policy for the company.</p>
      <p>While the company’s administrative offices are based in Houston, the company is considered Canadian by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, because its corporate home is in Ontario.</p>
