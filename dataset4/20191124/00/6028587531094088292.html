      <p>Data-led creativity has reached an inflection point. As a result, the era of art and commerce is giving way to a new age of art and science. We are amidst a data transformation revolution and the customer topography has never been more complex. Finding the right mix of algorithm and humanity is the Holy Grail or ultimate brand hack, no matter who you are, what you’re marketing, or who you are selling to.</p>

      <p>Consequently, a palpable need to formulate best-in-class “brand alchemy” is the new strategic imperative. This is the reason the past generation of “artists of business” I hailed in my book WE-Commerce, is quickly giving way to a new breed of executive that I am calling “artists of science.” Consequently, I’ve decided to launch a new <b><i>Brand Alchemy</i></b> Q+A series in parallel with my <b>Ask the CMO</b> column. I’ve done this to get into the minds of this new species of leadership, as I believe they will ultimately emerge as the creative Darwinists defining the future of both business and brand. </p>
      <p>For my most recent piece I decided to interview a senior executive who has relied on the right mix of creativity, science and technology to shape some of the world’s leading brands, most recently orchestrating the reimagination of <b><i>Time</i></b> magazine, which led to a sizable sale of the beleaguered media giant in just eight months, to Meredith Corporation. I sat down with Pearl Collings, new CEO of Contently, one of the world’s leading content platforms and a recently named leader in the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Content Platforms, to get the scoop on best practices all organizations should consider as they work to emerge as the media brands of tomorrow. Following is a recap of our conversation:</p>
      <p><b>Billee Howard:</b> Pearl! So excited to be chatting with you. Let’s dive right in with your thoughts on best practices that organizations need to keep in mind, since every company today, in some way, needs to think of themselves as a media brand.</p>
      <p><b>Pearl Collings:</b> That is very true. It has to ultimately be all about connecting you to your customer, right? Sometimes it comes down to simply creating an impression of uniqueness—of using storytelling to encode yourself in the long-term memory of the customer. Sometimes it's creating trust. I do believe recently we have lost a little bit of the idea that media doesn't just mean advertising dollars. Content has to be longer lasting, have bigger results. It needs to drive deeper engagement and a deeper connection. </p>
      <p>Another thing from a best practice point of view is asking: what are you trying to accomplish as a brand? Are you trying to be more socially responsible as a brand? Are you trying to hire more digitally savvy talent? Are you trying to gain market share? What do you want the outcome to be? </p>
      <p><b>Howard:</b> A lot of brands have overcorrected to be too algorithmic in general, and particularly when it comes to content. The market correction has presented the question of how do you marry creativity, technology and science in ways that are equally balanced. We all know content is king. We've been talking about that for ten years now. So what's new and what's the right mix? </p>
      <p><b>Collings:</b> From a technology standpoint, I think you want to automate most of the processes—not to replace human insight and input, but to use technology and software for basic broad processes. At Contently, for example, I am leading the team to work on brainy stuff that even A.I. or technology cannot do. So, my goal is how can I best leverage technology and science to focus on optimizing my marketing strategy? How can I focus on what the data says and then use it to have my team instigate thought-provoking dialogues with our brand clients? The idea is finding the right mix so that capacity in the room exists for creative. It is strategy getting the right balance of it all. The data is an almost operational element that catalyzes creativity through software and technology. </p>
      <p><b>Howard:</b> Well said. So, with your background in media, what I'm interested in is your perspective on best ways for brands to monetize their content. You've been doing that your whole career and you've obviously done it exceptionally well. Could you talk through your thoughts on the best ways brands can connect all the dots we just talked about to get to a meaningful outcome that is tied to improved performance? </p>
      <p><b>Collings:</b> There's no magic bullet that someone has figured out. There are definitely some models, some methodologies, but again, it goes back to: What data do you have? What are you tracking? What can you connect? What kind of attribution can you actually prove versus just making assumptions. You’ve got to examine the basics and then be able to connect the dots to be able to prove you’ve achieved it.</p>
      <p> Is it an awareness lift? Is it a sales lift? Is it content engagement? Is it a depth of engagement on the website? Like, what are we trying to do? Because then, in fact, in that performance, you will get numbers. You will already have baselines. Then you can say: “Okay, the following three KPIs say how content performed for me the past year or the past quarter. Can I grow 10 percent? And what would that take? Do I produce more content? Do I produce different content? Do I produce multimedia? What can I do to drive people to that content? That is the type of thinking brands should keep in mind when acting more like a media brand and connecting their content to improved performance. </p>
      <p><b>Howard:</b> We are approaching your first hundred days as CEO of Contently. I know we’ve talked about you evolving the business model around the notion of verticalization. I'd love to hear what you're doing in that regard in a way that other people can emulate when they're thinking about their brands?</p>
      <p><b>Collings:</b> Absolutely. So, I think there may be a quick two part answer to that. Number one, for verticalization, you’ve got to have a playbook. Again, what are you trying to accomplish? You know, the types of content and when to write it. What is the frequency? What is the channel? What is the distribution?</p>
      <p>Another key point is how you effectively move from one vertical to another. We are looking at customizing the technology for our overall content marketing strategy of each vertical—financial services, B2B tech, health, travel, etc.  At the end of the day, they each have their own lingo and ways of speaking. The audience profiles, the product and services, they are all different. So even though the playbook overall for us is very similar, the verticals themselves are very unique in that they all have their own voice and flavor and style and what they're trying to accomplish. </p>
      <p>Every brand has to speak their own language and if you want to connect with them authentically, you need to understand the nuance of each audience they are trying to communicate to.</p>
      <p><b>Howard: </b> Last time we chatted, we discussed the state of fractured trust in society and the need for content to be honest and transparent. As you guys are one of the leading content partners in the world, what's your point of view? </p>
      <p><b>Collings:</b> I definitely thought about this a lot more since we last talked because I hadn’t thought of it that way. I think people overall, but consumers in general, are more skeptical than ever. So the closer you get to an authentic, real, genuine voice, the more people appreciate that. I think there is so much more heightened sensitivity around that idea that brands need to be very aware when creating content. That's why we have rock solid reporting here at Contently—both in the content we produce for our own brand, and the work we do for our clients. Good fact checking, which is automated through the platform and also through our expert freelance editors. We aim to get to the facts and remove as much bias as possible. Brand leaders need to push their teams to be smart enough to read between the lines. Learning different sides of the story is also critical. We definitely hold ourselves to a strict code of ethics that we established eight years ago, and continues to drive our mission, values, and high standards for the content we create. </p>
