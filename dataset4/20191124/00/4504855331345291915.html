      <p>HONG KONG (AP) — Voting was underway Sunday in Hong Kong elections that have become a barometer of public support for anti-government protests now in their sixth month.</p>
      <p>Long lines formed outside polling stations for 452 seats in the city’s 18 district councils.</p>
      <p>The councils are largely advisory and have little power. But the election has taken on symbolic importance in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>A strong showing by the opposition would show that the public still supports the pro-democracy movement, even as the protests have become increasingly violent.</p>
      <p>The ruling camp in Hong Kong and the national government in Beijing hope that the unrest and disruption to daily life will turn voters against the movement.</p>
      <p>There has been a rare break in the violence in recent days as protesters, anxious to validate their cause through the ballot box, hit the pause button to ensure the polls won’t be postponed.</p>
      <p>“We need to show the world that our cause is legitimate. I don’t believe that Beijing will not respond to the Hong Kong people’s voice,” a black-clad and masked student Alex Wong said during a peaceful march Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said that the vote is a “real democratic exercise,” and that a strong police presence at polling stations will ensure that it proceeds smoothly.</p>
      <p>Online messages from protest support groups have advised people not to wear black or face masks during voting in case they are targeted by police.</p>
