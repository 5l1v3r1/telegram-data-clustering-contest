      <p>DALLAS (AP) - With the numbers in their favor, Joe Pavelski and Tyler Seguin came through in the shootout for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a>.</p>
      <p>Pavelski and Seguin both scored against goalie Robin Lehner in the tiebreaker to lift the surging <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> over the Chicago Blackhawks 2-1 on Saturday night for their sixth consecutive victory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> is 10-0-1 during an 11-game point streak, one shy of the team record.</p>
      <p>Pavelski, with 104 career shootout attempts, has converted 38% of them. Seguin is even better at 51% in 57 tries.</p>
      <p>Lehner, meanwhile, has stopped only 51% of the 96 shots he’s faced in shootouts.</p>

      <p>“I’m not very good at them,” Lehner said. “I don’t seem to make the save on the shootout but I do on the breakaway. I’ve tried to do a lot of different things.”</p>
      <p>At the other end was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> goalie Anton Khudobin, who stopped Jonathan Toews and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Patrick Kane</a> in the tiebreaker.</p>
      <p>Khudobin has been successful on 81% of the 61 shootout attempts against him.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know what to expect because I know they are both a hell of a player,” Khudobin said. “The stat says 50-50 they are going to be deking or shooting. On the first one, I’m lucky that I got the poke check. On the second one, it hit my glove, and went out. That’s it.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Khudobin tied his season high with 38 saves, including one on a breakaway by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a> in overtime.</p>
        <p>“He was the best player in the game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> coach Jim Montgomery said. “We’re very fortunate to have (Ben Bishop) as our starter and have him as 1B or 1A.”</p>
        <p>Lehner finished with 40 saves.</p>
        <p>Roope Hintz scored for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> and Olli Maatta for the Blackhawks in the first period.</p>
        <p>Chicago had two possible goals disallowed in the third.</p>
        <p>Just 2½ minutes into the period, a long video review confirmed a call of no goal after Khudobin stopped a close-up wrist shot by Dominik Kubalik and two other attempts to poke in the puck by David Kampf and Andrew Shaw.</p>
        <p>With three minutes to play, Dylan Strome redirected Maatta’s shot from the left point into the net. The ruling that the puck went off a high stick was upheld following a review.</p>
        <p>“We had a couple that may have went in,” Chicago coach Jeremy Colliton said. “That’s going to happen. Sometimes you’re going to get the bounces and the calls, but some nights you’re not. I thought we did enough to score.”</p>
        <p>A pair of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> just off injured reserve combined for the game’s first goal at 14:08 of the first period. In front of the net, Hintz deflected John Klingberg’s shot from the blue line past Lehner to become the first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> player with 10 goals this season.</p>
        <p>Maatta tied it with his first at 17:24. He took a cross-ice pass from Alex DeBrincat in the left faceoff circle, and Maatta’s wrist shot went in off Khudobin’s left leg.</p>
        <p>Nobody scored in the second period, even though each team had two power plays. It ended with two <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> and a Blackhawks player in the penalty boxes. Shots on goal for the teams over the first two periods were 25 each.</p>
        <p>Khudobin also stopped a snap shot by Zach Smith on a 2-on-1 break with nine minutes to play.</p>
        <p>By then, the game had swung back in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>’ direction. Chicago killed a penalty, and with 5:39 left <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>’ Jason Dickinson shot wide from short range.</p>
        <p>By going 13-1-1 in the last 15 games, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> has moved into second place in the Central Division, three points behind St. Louis.</p>
        <p>“(Chicago’s) a division rival,” Montgomery said, “and I don’t think we were on top of our game like we have been, and we still found a way to win.”</p>
        <p>NOTES: Lower-body injuries had sidelined Hintz for seven games and Klingberg for six. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> killed off all four Blackhawks power plays and has been successful on 34 of 37 penalty kills in the past nine games. Chicago’s power play is 1 for 17 in the last six. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a> assisted on Maatta’s goal to extend his point streak to 12 games. In 59 career games against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a> has 59 points (28 goals, 31 assists). He has more goals vs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> than any other team, with highs of 38 assists and 62 points against St. Louis. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a> is averaging at least a point per game against 17 teams. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> C Justin Dowling left late in the second period with an upper-body injury and didn’t return.</p>
