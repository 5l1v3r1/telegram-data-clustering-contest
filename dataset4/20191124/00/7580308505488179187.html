      <h1>Parents urged to spend quality time with their children at family day</h1>

      <p>The importance of parents spending quality time with their children was again emphasised, when Rightville School and Vineville Academy, Alaka Estate in Surulere recently celebrated this year’s family fun day. Together with its branch (Rightville School, Ajah), the event was a whole package meant to truly celebrate, entertain and improve the children.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, there was an exciting football match between Rightville School and K-Kotun Primary School, Surulere. The keenly contested match was won by Rightville School by just a goal margin.</p>
      <p>The proprietress of the schools, Mrs. Chinwe Anyas Nwankwo said: “The football match was organised to show our children that learning is not restricted to the four walls of the classroom. There are other equally important skills that are needed to survive in life. So, programmes like this are to help the children develop their God-given skills and talents.”</p>
      <p>On May 26, 2018, the fun-filled package hit the climax, as the grand finale of activities marking the Children’s Day was held. This took the form of a Family Fun Day, organised by the schools. And though parents were invited to have fun with their children in the inter-learning environment, the children were the focus.</p>
      <p>“The essence of all this is to encourage socialisation among parents and their children,” explained Mrs. Nwankwo. “It is also to build a strong relationship amongst all families in both schools.”The thrilled children and their parents described the fun day as an awesome experience.</p>
