      <h1>Links to early Black Friday deals in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>A number of local retailers have announced that they will hold early sales ahead of Black Friday, which falls on 29 November.</p>
      <p>With the shopping day falling later than usual this year, FNB says that more stores are likely to spread their deals out over a number of days to capitalise on the phenomenon and to ensure that their systems can handle the higher than usual load.</p>
      <p>A recent report by PwC found that consumers plan to spend 36% more this year versus 2018, with local shoppers planning to spend an average of R3,812 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019.</p>
      <p>It added that some 85% of South Africans surveyed confirmed that they intend to buy something or will consider it if there is a good enough deal.</p>
      <p>The most popular product categories during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019 will be durables like electrical equipment, technology goods, homewares, clothing, shoes and accessories, it said.</p>
      <p>The most notable early Black Friday deals are below.</p>
