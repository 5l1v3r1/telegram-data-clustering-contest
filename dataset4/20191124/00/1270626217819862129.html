      <p>Tottenham Manager, Jose Mourinho enjoyed a winning start with the team beating West Ham 3-2 at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>First half goals were scored by Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura and a third goal was from Harry Kane, four minutes after the break gave Tottenham their first Premier League away win since 20 January.</p>
      <p>The result piles pressure on West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, whose side have now collected two points from their last seven games.</p>
      <p>Under-fire keeper Roberto made an error for Son's opener and the hosts were booed off at half-time.</p>
      <p>Late goals from substitute Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna gave the final scoreline a flattering look however the result made a mockery of an ill-advised post from West Ham's social media team following Mourinho's appointment, highlighting previous difficulties the 56-year-old has endured at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in other matches Manchester City has beaten Chelsea 2-1, Arsenal and Southampton drew 2 all, Wolves beat Bournemouth 2-1, Leicester City beat Brighton 2-0, Burnley thrashed Watford 3-0, Liverpool defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 and Norwich City has beaten Everton 2-0.</p>
