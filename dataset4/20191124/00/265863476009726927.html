      <h1>RHOA – Porsha Williams Slams The Real Host Loni Love For Her Comment About Dennis McKinley</h1>

      <p><i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> star <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/porsha-williams-shares-some-juicy-details-about-her-upcoming-lavish-wedding-with-dennis-mckinley-after-the-cheating-scandals-that-rocked-real-housewives-of-atlanta-343496/">Porsha Williams</a> is not happy with <i>The Real</i> host Loni Love after a comment she made about her relationship with Dennis McKinley. The hosts of the daytime talk show were recently discussing the fact that Williams is still marrying McKinley even though he has been unfaithful, and Williams posted a clip from the discussion and went off on Loni Love in the caption.</p>
      <p>Williams posted a clip from the segment that began with Adrienne Bailon saying that she couldn’t be in a relationship with someone who cheated, but she’s not going to judge someone else for the way they choose to live their life or the decisions they make. Still, Bailon said she didn’t understand why Williams would choose to take McKinley back.</p>

      <p>Love then chimed in and said, “Let me tell you something, Porsha trying to get that reality show.”</p>
      <p>That comment didn’t go over well with Williams, who wrote in the caption of the clip, “B*tch F you! #FakeAss don’t run up smiling when I see you.”</p>
      <p>One of Williams’ fans wrote in the comments that she should take the clip down because she was above it, and the <i>RHOA</i> star replied that she would once Love saw it. However, it’s still on her Instagram page even though Love saw the post and commented.</p>
      <p>“Porsha.. I didn’t say anything bad and you know it…it was a lighthearted comment… I hope you get your show! #comic” wrote Love.</p>
      <p>The overwhelming piece of advice that fans wrote on Williams’ page was to not worry about what other people think or say, and to not let those voices bother her.</p>

      <p>“Just know you’re on their minds and your name is in their mouths,” wrote Golnesa Gharachedaghi.</p>
      <p>Others pointed out that Love was clearly joking and there was no need to get mad about the comment.</p>
      <p>As fans know, Williams’ relationship with McKinley has been a major storyline this season. Their whirlwind romance started in June 2018, and just three months later the couple was engaged and expecting a baby. Williams gave birth to their daughter Pilar in March, but by June of this year they had called off their engagement due to McKinley’s infidelity during her pregnancy.</p>
      <p>But now, Porsha Williams and Dennis McKinley are back together and are busy planning their wedding.</p>
      <p>New episodes of <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> air Sunday nights on Bravo.</p>
