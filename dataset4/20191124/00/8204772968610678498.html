      </figure>
      <p>The main event is finally on! After months of nationwide auditions and six weeks of televised heats, Anna Kearney (13) from Foxrock, Dublin will take to the Junior Eurovision stage in Gliwice, Poland to represent Ireland. Competing against 18 other countries, Anna will be hoping that her Irish-language song Banshee will win the prestigious event for Ireland. Anna is no stranger to large crowds, having played the title role in Annie at the National Concert Hall. She is also not the first in the family to appear at Eurovision: her mother, Eileen Martin, was part of Riverdance, which was the interval act at the 1994 event in Dublin.</p>
      <p><b>Our Guy in Japan</b><br/><i>Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm</i><br/>Guy Martin’s latest adventure takes him on a 2,500-mile journey around Japan to find out how the country works. He meets an 85-year-old engineering grandmaster who made parts for Japan’s first nuclear power stations. He also finds out how Japan deals with 1,500 earthquakes annually via the intense simulators at Tokyo’s Disaster Training School. After entering the gang culture of Tokyo, Guy messes around with some uniquely modified trucks, and decides to get his own “tebori” tattoo. Using sharp bamboo sticks, these hand-carved, painful works of art are a taboo in Japan because of their association with organised crime. And Guy also tries to hold his own in the auto race arena, the unique form of Japanese speedway.</p>
      <p><b>Kill Your TV: Jim Moir’s Weird World of Video Art</b><br/><i>Sunday, BBC4, 9pm</i><br/>The comedian (aka Vic Reeves) explores how different generations “hacked” the tools of television to pioneer new ways of creating art – especially now that we experience so much of the world through screens. The programme features contributions from leading British artists, including Isaac Julien and Rachel Maclean, as Jim discusses how new technology led to a creative explosion, from works of cosmic abstraction to feminist visions and Dadaist TV pranks. There is also a look at how the latest developments, such as artificial intelligence, may be used.</p>

      <p>Marking 80 years since the start of the second World War, the first of four films featuring four actors explores their grandparents’ wartime stories. This one focuses on Helena Bonham Carter’s grandparents – one set in France, one in England. Neither were conventional war heroes. Though they didn’t fight in any battles, they did save many lives. Her maternal grandfather was Spanish diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejon, who defied his government and helped Jews escape as the Nazis invaded France. Her paternal grandmother, Violet Bonham Carter, also took her own stand against anti-Semitism. This mother of four was also ahead of her time, volunteering as an air raid warden and campaigning for women’s rights.</p>

They wouldn’t let it lie, and following a successful first run or revamped laughs, now they’re back with another helping of surreal mayhem. In the first episode, Judge Nutmeg dispenses punishment to an unsuspecting audience member. Plus, the Ghost Hunters are on the prowl, and Bob takes viewers back to the 1980s with a special performance.</p>
      <p><b>The Man Who Saw Too Much</b><br/><i>Wednesday, BBC1, 11.45pm</i><br/>At 106, Boris Pahor is the oldest living survivor of a Nazi concentration camp; he has written about his time in his literary masterpiece, Necropolis (1967).

Pahor, who was not Jewish, was arrested for resisting the Nazis and handed over to the Gestapo and SS. Alan Yentob visits Pahor at his home in Trieste. His harrowing descriptions are illustrated with remarkable drawings by fellow prisoners to create a moving record of conditions in the Nazi death camps.</p>

His journey will take him down some unexpected paths as he is forced to re-examine his own methods and reassess the role of chef in a changing culinary world. He’ll meet chef and producers from around the world, learn how the global chef shortage is affecting his industry, and see climate change is impacting on food producers. The programme brings us all the way to a nailbiting showdown at the Michelin awards, where Grey will finally learn if his quest has been successful.</p>

It’s a lot of long hauling on the interstates as he turns south again for San Antonio and gets up and close with some cowboys buying a hat and going to the rodeo. Then it’s time for the epic trip across the desert to El Paso to meet the US Border Patrol and get his first view of Donald Trump’s infamous wall.</p>

From singing in her father’s pub in Meenaleck to the great theatres in the world, Clannad – singing mostly in Irish – has sold more tan 50 million albums. The multi-award-winning band has, without doubt, done more than any other group to take Irish music and the Irish language to a worldwide audience. Fusing elements of traditional with more contemporary folk, new age and rock, they have created a beautifully unique and ethereal sound.

      <p>The rights of use and ownership of marine and coastal zones are being reallocated worldwide. In line with global market rules and largely kept hidden from the public, changing national and international legislation is leading to a development that is overruling the traditional rights of use of local communities. The beneficiaries of this gradual process of privatisation and commercialisation are international corporations, organisations and states. This investigative documentary examines the consequences of these trends in India, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica and Kenya.</p>
      <p><b>Buy It Now for Christmas</b><br/><i>Thursday, Channel 4, 8pm</i><br/>Inventors of possibly “perfect” gifts are invited into the studio to try and get their product on the shelves in time for Christmas. Rylan Clark-Neal welcomes the inventors who pitch to an audience of real shoppers and get live feedback on the new ideas. Retailers Amazon Launchpad, Lakeland and JML then decide whether or not to make a big order. In the first of four episodes, a retired Yorkshire couple believe their cafetiere with a twist is worth the life savings they invested. We also meet Bridget from Newcastle, who thinks her marmalade will make perfect Christmas cocktail. A new card game, courtesy of a nine-year-old girl, could be the perfect stocking filler, and musical director Roger hopes his innovative roasting tin will leave him quids in.</p>

Luckily, Chris Packham has an idea. The naturalist, along with guest presenters including former Today Programme host John Humphrys, aims to raise enough money to plant 100,000 trees across Britain by asking viewers to contribute to the Woodland Trust. Martin Hughes-Games, JB Gill and Clare Nasir also take a closer look at the science of trees, exploring how they can lower carbon emissions, fight flooding and reduce pollution.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was a young TV presenter who wanted to give a special treat to all the boys and girls before Christmas. He thought, why not put on a special edition of The Late Late Show, where the kids can try out toys and maybe do a little party piece as well. I could wear a funny jumper – that’ll be comedy gold! Who knows, perhaps a few families might tune in. But the show became so popular that soon, every Irish person in the world was watching, and the young TV presenter suddenly found himself under pressure to come up with something bigger and better and more spectacular each year. Before long, his benign smile was replaced by a haunted look, as the demands of The Late Late Toy Show consumed his very soul . . . Happily, Ryan Tubridy has not yet been reduced to a hollow shell by 10 years of fronting the Toy Show. In fact, he’s positively blooming, and even burst into song for last year’s opening number, not sounding at all like a foghorn. It’s clear the Toy Show brings out the kid in our Tubs, and he’s promising an even bigger extravaganza for his 11th outing in the naff Christmas jumper. This year’s theme is being kept under wraps, but given the events of the year, I’m guessing climate could get a mention. One thing’s for sure: there’s bound to be a nod or two to the man who started the snowball rolling, the late Gay Byrne. So gather round the telly, boys and girls, mums and dads, grannies and grandads, and get ready for the year’s biggest night in.</p>

      <p><b>Unreported World</b><br/><i>Friday, Channel 4, 7.30pm</i><br/>It’s almost three years since a former gameshow host took office as President of the United States, and became the most controversial POTUS in living memory. Reporter Karishma Vyas visits California to meet the “TradWives”, a growing movement of women in the US, young and old, who idolise President Donald Trump. They are putting him at the heart of their anti-feminist, traditional family values and working hard to help secure him a second term. This is despite the fact that women have often borne the brunt of Trump’s political and personal barbs.</p>

McDonald later visits one of the world’s most photographed sites: Niagara Falls.

When Turner first came to Margate, he marvelled at “the loveliest skies in all Europe”. Others have also been drawn to the seaside and the sense that they might be able to find a new beginning here. This film reveals how these influxes of incomers – and the arrival of the Turner Institute – have affected the town. There are also contributions from Margate-born Tracey Emin, the Turner Prize shortlist artists and some local residents.</p>
