        <b>From sleeping in a phone box to founding a six-figure business teaching martial arts, it's been an eventful two years for Gavin Eastham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In February last year, he found himself being pelted with hailstones on his first night on the streets.</p>
      <p>The 36 year-old's marriage had broken down and, having suffered a back injury, he wasn't able to work.</p>
      <p>"Because I'm not originally from north Wales, it meant I had no contacts. I had nowhere else to go," he said.</p>
      <p>His ex-wife thought he had somewhere else to stay but he didn't.</p>
      <p>He decided to go to the local library, initially to stay warm, but he felt time-pressured to turn things around.</p>
      <p>"I thought the minute I was homeless, I'd look homeless and if I look homeless people are going to look at me in a certain way," he told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bg6p">BBC's Wake Up to Money</a>.</p>

      <p>After spending a few days there, the local librarian became suspicious. He told her he had plans to set up his own business.</p>
      <p>"I thought I need to make a positive change, I need to do something," he said.</p>
      <h3>Strategy by day, shelter by night</h3>
      <p>He was also using the library for something more pressing: "I was actually researching how to survive being homeless. I'm a bit of a city boy so I did a bit of research reading blogs and forums about how to survive on the streets."</p>
      <p>While at night he'd focus on finding shelter, by day he was reading books on business strategy.</p>
      <p>"This sounds crazy but the only thing I've ever been good or half decent at was martial arts. How could I turn that into an opportunity to secure my future?"</p>

      <p>He started researching and came up with a company name and logo, wrote a syllabus and bought a domain name for Â£1.58.</p>
      <p>"I thought - if I've got a domain name I've got to keep going."</p>
      <p>"This dream I thought that I might one day fulfil was giving me the energy I needed to survive."</p>
      <p>After three weeks on the streets, he managed to secure temporary housing and then, in May last year, launched his martial arts school Cobra Life in Flintshire, Wales.</p>

      <p>Now he says he has a "thriving business, turning over six figures."</p>
      <p>With plans to franchise, he's looking to hire a full-time instructor: "That is going to give me chance to get off the dance floor and onto the balcony, to strategise and expand," he said.</p>
      <p>He said the teachings of martial arts gave him the strength to continue: "Those essential skills have been instilled since a child so even though times were tough I knew I had to persevere and focus on my goals which were simply dreams written down!"</p>
