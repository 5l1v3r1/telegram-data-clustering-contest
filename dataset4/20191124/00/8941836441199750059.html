      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona officials are attempting to overcome glitches in the state-run campaign finance website as the election year approaches.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arizona-capitol-times/">Arizona Capitol Times</a> reported the state’s website See The Money and its campaign-finance database have not worked properly since the 2018 election.</p>
      <p>Candidates throughout the state will file the first financial reports for the 2020 campaign cycle in January.</p>
      <p>Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs says her staff has spent the past year working to ensure See The Money accurately displays campaign finance information in a simple and intuitive way.</p>
      <p>Political professionals say the website’s flaws have led to misleading or confusing data.</p>

      <p>Hobbs says the state relies on the public to report problems with posted information, but the site still has not reached the level of being a “functional tool.”</p>
