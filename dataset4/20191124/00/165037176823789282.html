      <p>AS' reviews the <b>half-time conversations</b> that went on in the dressing room, with several groups forming. </p>
      <p>The source says Valverde tried to lift his team's spirits, alongside second-placed Jon Aspiazu. He invited them to push harder and press more in order to create chances. Additionally, there were also some who complained and seemed disapproving.</p>

      <p>"<b>What are we playing at</b>," were the reported words from<b> one of the team's heavyweights</b>. The source highlights laments and complaints of some members of the first squad, while many opted for silence.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the Frenchmen of the team, <b>Griezmann, Umtiti and Dembele</b>, discussed on their own in relation to the team's lack of cohesion in the first half.</p>
      <p>Barcelona's second half was not much different, but a reported speech by Piqué and Luis Suárez in the tunnel. They scored early and made sure to beat Leganés despite their below-average performance. </p>
