      <p>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s boycott of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a>’s Golden Horse film awards demonstrates how politics can take its toll on the arts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a>’s order to give Saturday night’s awards show the cold shoulder was part of its campaign to rachet up economic and political pressure on the island it claims as its own territory.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters Saturday night, Lee said politics was “an aspect we do not want to see. But we have to face it, because we live in this world.”</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows it, it is indeed a loss, no matter the red carpet or the films,” said Lee, the festival’s chair. “But of course, our best films, I personally think that they are not less good than the previous years. We still have very good films this year.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> held its own Golden Rooster film awards Saturday, featuring films approved by Communist Party censors.</p>

      <p>Even without the ban, Chinese artists might have found it difficult to attend after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a> issued a ban on solo travel to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> beginning Sept. 1.</p>
      <p>Chinese participation came into doubt following last year’s ceremony, when documentary director Fu Yue said in her award acceptance speech that she hoped the world would one day recognize <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> as an independent country, something only a handful of nations currently do.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> split from mainland <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> amid civil war in 1949, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a> considers the self-ruled island part of its territory.</p>
      <p>Speakers at Saturday’s Golden Horse Awards also expressed support for anti-government protesters in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory of Hong Kong.</p>
