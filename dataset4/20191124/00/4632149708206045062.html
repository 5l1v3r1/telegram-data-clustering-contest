      <h1>Cheteshwar Pujara: Not easy to pick pink ball with kind of bowlers we have</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p><i>Cheteshwar Pujara said Bangladesh's pink-ball inexperience has led to their batsmen taking blows.<br/></i><br/><b>On batting under lights <br/></b><br/>The first session is easier to bat. When there is light, the ball starts to swing a little bit more. It's a new challenge for batsmen as we only batted in sunlight with red ball in Tests. <br/><br/><b>Difference between SG and Kookaburra pink ball <br/></b><br/>The SG ball is helping spinners a little more than the Kookaburra ball. When I played with the Kookaburra in the Duleep Trophy, I don't think there was so much assistance for spinners apart from wrist spinners. But with the SG ball, we saw Taijul Islam getting some purchase and R Ashwin too getting a little bit more spin. But still, it is not as much as you get with the red ball. <br/><br/><b>On India's declaration timing </b><br/><br/>That was the right time to bowl as the ball was swinging. We felt if we start bowling at the time we can pick early wickets. That is what happened. <br/><br/><b>On so many batsmen getting hit on the head <br/></b><br/>As a batsman, it is not easy to pick the ball (pink) especially the short ball with the kind of fast bowlers we have.</p>

      <h4>Meet Pinku and Tinku</h4>
      <p>With everything unique happening around the first-ever Day/Night Test match in India, this takes the cherry on the cake. Sourav Ganguly posed with the two mascots for the first pink ball test match, named Pinku and Tinku. Photo: Twitter</p>

      <h4>The legends</h4>
      <p>Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and VVS Laxman were present to witness the historic day. Former Indian cricketers in attendance also included Sadagopan Ramesh, Saba Karim, Sunil Joshi, Ajit Agarkar, Venkatesh Prasad, Kapil Dev, Dilip Vengsarkar, Mohammed Azharuddin, K Srikkanth, Farokh Engineer and Chandu Borde. "I'm really really excited to come here to Kolkata. I know that this is the new leaf in the Indian cricket's history because this is the first day-night Test match. Great effort by Sourav and the rest of the team at the BCCI (sic)," Tendulkar had told reporters after arriving. Photo by Debajyoti Chakraborty/ BCCL</p>
      <h4>'Oye faulad ki aulad'</h4>
      <p>Virat Kohli was seen practising with the pink ball ahead of the Test match. He was caught in the moment, laying on the grass and staring at the ball, sending meme vibes to the internet universe. Earlier, Virat Kohli had said, “Obviously we wanted to get a feel of pink-ball cricket. Eventually, it had to happen. But you can’t bring up those things before a big tour that you’re going to and suddenly in the schedule, there’s a pink-ball Test when we haven’t even practised with the pink ball, we haven’t played any first-class games with the pink ball. “The thing was to experience the pink-ball Test in our own conditions first, so you get the hang of how the ball behaves. Then eventually going and playing with the pink ball anywhere in the world." Photo by Debajyoti Chakraborty/ BCCL</p>
      <h4>Set.. go...</h4>
      <p>Ishant Sharma was seen practising with the pink ball on November 21. All eyes would be on the Indian bowlers on the first day/night Test after performing remarkably well in the first Test match against Bangladesh. Fans can't wait to see Indian bowlers tearing the stumps apart. Former opener Gautam Gambhir had earlier said that he feels the India and Bangladesh captains need to be innovative while handling their pacers with the pink ball, including using them frequently under lights for more effectiveness.

      <h4>Practice mode on</h4>
      <p>Bangladesh's cricketers attended a practice session at The Eden Gardens cricket stadium in Kolkata on November 21 ahead of the second Test cricket match between India and Bangladesh. Although, Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque rued that his team didn't even get a practice game to prepare before taking on the formidable India in the first-ever day/night Test. The current Bangladesh team have no pink ball experience even at the domestic level. They only had four sessions, including two in Indore. Photo by Debajyoti Chakraborty/ BCCL</p>
      <h4>Dear pink ball, get ready</h4>

      <h4>Paint the town pink</h4>
      <p>Keeping up with the hype, to mark the historic occasion of the first-ever day-night Test in India, all the iconic spots of Kolkata, where the match will be held will turn pink. The famous tourist points in the city are lit up in pink to attract more people to the country's first pink-ball Test. Landmarks like the Big Ben on Laketown, Howrah Bridge, Tata Centre, Eden Gardens, the Elliot Park, and Shahid Minar are all decked in pink to mark the occasion. If that's not enough, the names on the manual scoreboard will also be written in pink and the stands will be lit in pink once the sun goes down. Photo: PTI</p>
      <h4>Cultural show</h4>

      <h4>'Feels a bit heavy'</h4>
      <p>Indian cricket will finally embrace the pink revolution as Kohli's formidable team lock horns with a deflated Bangladesh in their maiden Day/Night Test. At the practice sessions, one thing that surprised Virat Kohli was that the pink ball felt like a heavy hockey ball to him. "It's purely because of the extra glaze on the ball, it is definitely much harder. For some reason, it felt heavy and even the throws took a lot more effort than the red colour to reach the wicketkeeper," he said. Photo by Debajyoti Chakraborty/ BCCL</p>
