        <b>Arsenal have got off to a bad start, accepts Robert Pires, but the former Gunner still has faith Unai Emery can turn results around.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Robert Pires</b> concedes<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/"> Arsenal</a> are "in big trouble" but is <b>backing Unai Emery</b> as the right coach to change their fortunes.</p>
      <p>A late goal from <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-lacazette-81110/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> – his second of the game – salvaged a<b> 2-2 home draw</b> against <b>Southampton</b> on Saturday, with Arsenal now<b> without a win in their last five</b> Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>The Gunners sit<b> </b>a worrying<b> eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea </b>after just 13 games.</p>
      <p>Saturday's result <b>piled more pressure on Emery, </b>with Arsenal's fanbase growing increasingly restless.</p>
      <p>But Pires, who won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups during his time at Arsenal under Arsene Wenger,<b> believes Emery can correct their dismal form.</b></p>
      <p>"Everybody knows at Arsenal, even Unai Emery, that <b>they are in big trouble," </b>Pires told Omnisport, speaking as part of the UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour driven by Nissan.</p>
      <p><b>"But [Emery] is a competitor,</b> he knows the high level. He was a great manager with Sevilla, with Paris Saint-Germain, but the situation is not so good".</p>
      <p>"He is a good manager,<b> I think he will make a success with Arsenal.</b> I hope for him anyway. The situation isn't so good, but him and the players need to find the solution."</p>
      <p>Pires said <b>Arsenal must still push for a top-four place</b>, given the Champions League is where the best players want to be.</p>

      <p>He said: "The target for Arsenal and for Unai is to finish in the top four because<b> it's very important for Arsenal to play again in the Champions League</b> next season".</p>
      <p>"I don't know what will happen at the end of the season, especially for Arsenal. For some players - <b>[Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang, Lacazette, </b>or even<b> Mesut Ozil </b>- the first thing for them and all the Arsenal players is to finish in the top four."</p>

      <p>Arsenal's north London rivals <b>Tottenham underwent managerial upheaval in midweek, </b>with <b>Mauricio Pochettino </b>replaced by <b>Jose Mourinho</b> following a dismal start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Mourinho started his tenure with a 3-2 win at West Ham, and despite Arsenal's rivalry with Spurs, Pires is glad to see the former Manchester United and Chelsea boss back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"I think it's great news for football generally, and of course for the Premier League. <b>Everyone knows that Mourinho is one of the best managers</b> in the world," Pires said.</p>
      <p>"He won lots of titles: Spain, Italy, and of course in the UK. In the UK, we know there is competition between Spurs and Gunners, but this is football and<b> I'm very sad for Mauricio Pochettino".</b></p>
      <p>"He is a great manager, <b>only six months ago he got to the final of the Champions League</b>. Unfortunately for him he lost against Liverpool and now he is sacked".</p>
      <p>"So footballers or even the manager, <b>things are tough."</b></p>
