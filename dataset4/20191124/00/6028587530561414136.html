      <h1>Alibaba Bets On Hong Kong For Financial And Political Reasons</h1>

      <p>Alibaba is placing a strategic bet on Hong Kong as the Chinese tech titan prepares to kick off a mega IPO of at least $11 billion on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The move comes at a risky time as anti-government protests have created a tense environment in Hong Kong. But for Alibaba, a listing in Hong Kong is a coming home. It could also be seen as a hedge against increased scrutiny of Chinese companies in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 in a record-breaking IPO that raised $25 billion. Alibaba decided against Hong Kong as its natural first choice then due primarily to Hong Kong Stock Exchange regulations that prevented dual-class capital structures. The HKSE has since loosened its rules to allow dual-class shares that are common with emerging tech companies. Alibaba’s plan to add a listing in Asia could be followed by other U.S.-publicly traded Chinese tech companies.</p>
      <p>This secondary listing by Alibaba in Hong Kong could be seen as a wise move in case U.S. regulators take aim at Chinese-listed companies in New York. A possible ban on further listings of Chinese companies in the U.S. has been considered by the White House. Delistings and locks on U.S. pension funds investing in publicly traded China shares have also been under consideration.</p>
      <p>With growing scrutiny and distrust of China in the U.S., Alibaba’s listing of its shares closer to home is a strategic step in case frictions continue to heighten over U.S.-China rivalry and related tech cold war and trade issues. Alibaba could see strong support in its Hong Kong IPO from Mainland China investors familiar with the e-commerce giant. Alibaba intends to keep NYSE as its primary listing exchange, according to a report by the BBC.</p>
      <p>Why does Alibaba need more capital now? Like the other original tech titans of China know as the BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent), Alibaba has expanded way beyond its initial focus, owning large chunks of China’s economy. Alibaba has gotten into cloud computing, mobile payments, fintech, messaging, artificial intelligence, robotics and logistics. It’s moved into new geographies as well, initially investing in U.S. tech startups but lately turning to buying into Southeast Asia and Israel, where its investments are more welcome than in the current U.S. climate. This new drive outside China offers opportunities for Alibaba to transplant its Chinese business model of e-commerce marketplaces into similar turf nearby within the region. It also lets Alibaba capture insights into R&amp;D knowhow from investments in the Israeli startup nation.</p>
      <p>The bold Hong Kong IPO move comes after Alibaba scored $38 billion in another record-breaking sales day for its 11.11 Singles Day that the e-commerce player started a decade ago in China, using discounts within a 24-hour period as way to drive merchandise volume. The Chinese shopping “holiday” has since dwarfed Black Friday and Cyber Monday merchandise sales in the U.S.</p>
      <p>The decision to go for a secondary listing in Hong Kong is widely seen as not only a smart financial move but also a politically savvy one that looks to Beijing. It could spark a wave of emerging tech companies (following the successful Hong Kong IPOs of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi and superapp Meituan in 2018) to turn to IPOs close to their home base.</p>
      <p>As an aside, my own travels in Hong Kong over the past three weeks was without any personal safety incidents – except for the pain of having to postpone a Silicon Dragon event set for November 14. It’s now rescheduled for <a href="https://www.silicondragonventures.com/event/silicon-dragon-awards-2019/">Feb. 11, 2020</a> during StartmeupHK Festival 2020, when hopefully things will be calmer.</p>
      <p>What amazed me about the protests I saw in Central and Admiralty over the past few weeks was how different the scene was up close in comparison to the TV newscasts. I saw mostly peaceful gatherings and some road closures in the central business district. Hong Kong’ers cued up to observe the gatherings from the security of elevated walkways just above the protest groups. Life seemed to be going about fairly routinely – people shopping, going to work – although the streets were largely empty at night, a few public transit lines were shut down or had limited services, some offices closed early or encouraged staff to work at home, schools were shut, and hotels checked on guests during periods I was in and of the city on various assignments and the book tour for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tech-Titans-China-challenging-innovating-ebook/dp/B07MJ5Y7B4">Tech Titans of China</a>. One thing I realized is that for safety reasons, it’s better not to have a ground floor space, restaurant or lobby that can be accessed easily. Security is everywhere, and I didn’t feel frightened.</p>
      <p>Alibaba’s bold decision to list in Hong Kong now is a vote of confidence in the city’s future. I’m looking forward to returning to Hong Kong soon!</p>
