      <h1>Imputed Distributions To Evade Charging Order Result In Receiver And Sale Of Assets In Earthgrains</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Adkisson</a></address>
      <p>It has been four years since EarthGrains Baking Companies obtained a <a href="https://chargingorder.com/">charging order</a> against Sycamore Family LLC, as related in my article <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2015/09/19/earthgrains-turns-up-the-heat-with-utah-charging-order-against-nevada-llc/">EarthGrains Turns Up The Heat With Utah Charging Order Against Nevada LLC</a>, published on September 19, 2015.At that time, EarthGrains held a judgment in excess of $6 million against Sycamore Family Baker Inc. and Leland Sycamore. The Sycamore Family LLC was owned by Leland Sycamore 48%, by his wife Jeri Sycamore 48%, and with 2% remaining spread across their four children. EarthGrains had obtained a charging order against Leland's 48%, but distributions were only being made to Jeri's 48% and the court then had to deal with that issue.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward four years, and we find that the Court has since appointed a Receiver for the assets of the Sycamore Family LLC so that distributions may be forced to Leland Sycamore's 48% interest which is subject to EarthGrains' charging order.</p>
      <p>The Receiver calculated that over $3.8 million should have been distributed to Leland, which calculations included recharacterizing a "loan" to one of the Sycamore children as an imputed distribution.</p>
      <p>However, the Sycamore Family LLC only has $1.1 million in its bank accounts, so the Receiver has also recommended to the Court that real estate owned by the Sycamore Family LLC be liquidated to cover the difference. The Sycamores didn't like this much, and argued that the Receiver's actions had the effect of interfering with the interests of the non-debtor members, which the inherent limitations of a charging order remedy are meant to prevent:</p>
      <p>“The Sycamores further claim that the Receiver’s recommendations are against Utah law. The Sycamores contend that the Utah Limited Liability Act (“LLC Act”) does not allow for the liquidation of the LLC’s real estate assets. However, the LLC Act contemplates this remedy by allowing a Receiver to be appointed and orders put in place to give effect to the charging order. The Sycamores claim liquidation of the LLC’s real estate assets is not allowable because it would force the members of the LLC to accept a creditor of Leland Sycamore. But the Receiver’s recommendation does not require acceptance of a creditor, it advocates for selling assets to raise liquid assets. Because the LLC does not have sufficient cash assets to make the payments that should have been made to EarthGrains, and the LLC will not be able to do so in any reasonable amount of time, liquidation gives effect to the Charging Order as contemplated by the LLC Act. The Sycamores provide no argument as to why real estate holdings should be treated differently from cash assets with respect to ensuring compliance with the Charging Order.”</p>
      <p>The Sycamores argued that not all the imputed distributions should be cured by the Receiver, but only those which occurred after the Receiver was appointed but not those imputed distributions that occurred before. The Court held that this was basically nonsense since the whole purpose of the charging order was to remedy Earthgrains on its unpaid judgment, and thus it was the date of the charging order that was important and not the date the Receiver was appointed.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the Court again rejected the Sycamores' arguments, just as it had done two years ago, that Nevada law should apply since the Sycamore Family LLC was a Nevada LLC, and that the Internal Affairs Doctrine should govern. The Court's ruling here is consistent with charging order law generally, which is that the law of the state where the post-judgment enforcement proceeding is ongoing is the proper law for the charging order, and the Internal Affairs Doctrine has never applied to third-party creditors.</p>
      <p>In the end, the Court adopted the Receiver's recommendations and order the Receiver to pay EarthGrains the $1.1 million in cash which the Sycamore Family LLC had in its bank accounts, and to liquidate enough of the Sycamore Family LLC's real estate holdings to even-up the distributions to Leland's interest in the precisely-calculated amount of $2,759,898.96.</p>

        <b>ANALYSIS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes one will hear asset protection planners say things like, "if a creditor gets a charging order against your LLC, then you'll just have the LLC make distributions to your spouse or pay your credit cards or something until the creditor goes away." That is not at all realistic, as this case illustrates.</p>
      <p>In creditor-debtor law, the concept exists of "imputed income" by which the debtor receives some monetary benefit from an entity without actually receiving cash. In the past, this concept was mostly applied to situations where the debtor's place of employment paid his bills and credit cards, etc., so that those moneys were not subject to garnishment.</p>
      <p>Recent years have seen the concept of "imputed income" being applied to what amounts to "imputed distributions" from trusts or, as here, from LLCs. The idea is exactly the same: The debtor might not be receiving cash directly, but the creditor can treat whatever benefits the debtor did receive as if it were a cash distribution and thereby impose a liability directly against the entity that paid it (thus making it a debtor, as least as to that amount, as well).</p>
      <p>Note that there are voidable transaction (was: fraudulent transfer) issues here as well, because the debtor is essentially transferring her right to receive distributions (an asset) to other members of the LLCs.</p>
      <p>The concept of imputed dividend is a powerful weapon in a creditor's arsenal, because it has the effect of deterring the making of distributions that are lopsided in favor of non-debtor members, a/k/a "special allocations", since distribution to those members may be imputed to the debtor as well. Once the entity itself becomes a debtor ⸺ even if to a relatively small portion of its assets ⸺ then, as here, the creditor can get "inside" the entity by way of a receiver and start liquidating the entity's assets, which is something that no mere charging order can ever get close to doing.</p>
      <p>The net effect is that for the entity and the non-debtor members to start allowing benefits to go to the debtor in circumvention of the charging order, then they themselves are putting the entity's assets at risk. This creates a very powerful incentive to not allow anything to go to the debtor, whether by lopsided distributions to other members, loans, payment of bills and credit cards, or whatever. At the same time, if they don't make proportionally equal distributions to the debtor member, then they themselves cannot get their proportional distributions from the entity either.</p>
      <p>While the law in the area of distributions as wages is still developing, in the so-called "Family LLC" context, it probably makes good planning sense to pay all individual members some salary, such that even if a creditor is able to garnish its 25% of the debtor's net disposable income, the debtor is still left with some cash (the other 75%) to be able to use for living expenses. However, almost nobody actually does this, and so messes as occurred here are later created when the debtor or the other members need money from the LLC. Also note that there is an argument that goes around to the effect that all benefits that go to a member are in the way of distributions and thus are not wages; I've never bought this argument, mainly because it is based on tax concepts that are utterly irrelevant to civil law, but it is out there and, who knows, maybe it is a winner.</p>
      <p>Finally, it is worth noting that yet another court has rejected the idea that charging orders are to be evaluated according to the law of where the LLC is formed a/k/a state of formation, as opposed to where the post-judgment enforcement proceedings are ongoing. Here, a Utah court applied Utah charging order law to this Utah proceeding, not Nevada law where the LLC was formed. Folks who think they are getting some big benefit from creating an out-of-state LLC should take this into account.</p>
