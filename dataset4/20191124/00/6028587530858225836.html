      <p>All it takes is one. That old boxing adage has never been more appropriate than when describing a Deontay Wilder fight. On Saturday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Wilder successfully defended his WBC Heavyweight title with a stunning seventh-round KO over Luis Ortiz in an important rematch of their 2018 brawl.</p>
      <p>Through six rounds, neither man was doing much, but Ortiz was winning most of the frames. Wilder was seemingly biding his time until he unleashed one of his signature bombs that ended the fight. Here is a look at the seventh-round highlight-reel KO:</p>
      <p>Here is how the boxing community reacted to Wilder’s finish:</p>
      <p>If there is a such thing as a clutch performer in boxing, Wilder is that guy. On multiple occasions I’ve seen him turn the tide in a close fight–or one that he was losing–with a titanic right hand.</p>
      <p>That’s exactly what he did on Saturday night. As was the case in their first meeting, Ortiz’s guile, quickness and southpaw stance kept the champion tentative early on in the fight. Ortiz landed a few solid left hands and while they got Wilder’s attention, none of the punches hurt him.</p>

      <p>In the sixth round, Wilder appeared to get a little more comfortable. He began throwing his jab more frequently and with more conviction. He committed to holding his ground on Ortiz’s advances which enabled him to land the power shot that ended their first fight.</p>
      <p>This time, he set up the finishing blow with a pawing jab. The fight changed on a short, devastating straight right that smashed against Ortiz’s head in violent fashion. Ortiz went down like a ton of bricks with a clearly glazed look on his face.</p>

      <p>He got to his feet at referee Kenny Bayless’ eight or nine count, but Ortiz still looked out of it. Bayless made the right call waving off the fight. Wilder is such a big puncher and Ortiz’s head wasn’t clear enough to continue.</p>
      <p>Once Ortiz regained his wherewithal, he showed his disappointment in the result as his corner men tried to console him. Ortiz was boxing well, but the margin for error against Wilder is so small. It’s almost as if he makes his opponents fight a perfect fight. If they slip and leave themselves vulnerable for an instant, he can turn out the lights with one shot.</p>
      <p>The KO win gave Wilder his 10th successful title defense and ran his record to a remarkable 45-0-1 with 44 KOs. Ortiz fell to a respectable 31-2 with his only two defeats coming at the hands of Wilder. Next up for Wilder is another rematch. He is scheduled to face lineal heavyweight champion Tyson Fury in February.</p>
      <p>Their first fight ended in a draw, and the second bout will be one of the biggest of 2020. Wilder expressed an interest in facing the winner of the Dec. 7 rematch between Anthony Joshua and reigning WBA, IBF and WBO champion Andy Ruiz. If Wilder has his way, we could see a unified heavyweight champion in 2020.</p>
      <p>Ortiz still has plenty in the tank and I firmly believe he gives every heavyweight in the division–Fury, Ruiz and Joshua included–a tough fight. In fact, I’m not sure he doesn’t beat them all. I don’t know who he’ll get in his next fight, as it seems clear the 40-year-old Cuban wants to continue his career.</p>
      <p>Perhaps a meeting with Adam Kownacki, another top heavyweight, would be an interesting scrap. If Kownacki wins, he’d have to be considered a strong title contender for the man that emerges from the Wilder, Fury, Joshua, and Ruiz tango. At the very least, Kownacki might be an alternative opponent for Wilder at some point in 2020.</p>
