      <h1>The 13 teams looking to join Bayern, Juve and PSG</h1>

        <b>The Champions League's Group Stage continues with its 5th round now, and 13 contenders are still looking to advance to the round of 16 and join the already secure Bayern Munich, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The champions of the Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 did their homework on the fourth matchday of the Champions League, confirming their spot in the next round UCL round before the international break by making an impeccable start to the tournament. </p>
      <p>Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Tottenham, Manchester City, Shakhtar, Liverpool, Napoli, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Lyon, and Chelsea could all soon be joining them.</p>
      <p><b>Neymar's return to the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium</b> is one of the attractions of Tuesday's clash between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. The Madrid team, who managed to better their performances in the tournament against Galatasaray  is one of those who can achieve their goal of going through and therefore calmly confront the next round if they win at home. </p>
      <p><b>If Zinedine Zidane's side beat Thomas Tuchel's side,</b> who have won all their games and are the only team not to have conceded a goal, they will be<b> assured of a place in the Round of 16</b>. Paris Saint-Germain are on the verge of assuring the top spot in Group A.</p>
      <p><b>Real Madrid could also benefit from Club Brugge's match</b> against Galatasaray, with the Turks having no chance of progressing in the tournament.</p>
      <p><b>Tottenham </b>are in a similar situation. The European runner-up had a doubtful start, but their improvement will prolong their stay in the tournament. In fact, If Mourinho's new team could <b>confirm their spot in the next round if they manage to beat Olympiakos at home</b>, therefore taking second place in a group dominated by Bayern, who could themselves assure their first place spot if they win against Red Star in Belgrade. </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Shakhtar Donetsk could also meet their target of qualifying to the next round. Both meet at the Etihad on Tuesday. The English champions, who will be coming into the tournament after a confidence-boosting Premier League triumph over Chelsea, only need a draw on Matchday 5 in order to qualify. Meanwhile, the Ukranian team will be in the Round of 16 if they defeat City at home.</p>

      <p>In the same group, Dinamo Zagreb could also eventually go through, although it looks unlikely. They are playing Atalanta, who have not managed a single win and now sit at the bottom of the group. </p>
      <p><b>Meanwhile, Atletico visit Turin in search of a ticket to the next round.</b> Maurizio Sarri's team, already qualified, will secure first place if they get all three points against the Spanish representative.<b> Simeone's side, who took a step back after losing in Leverkusen, need victory in Italy</b> or both group matches to be drawn.</p>
      <p>However, Bayer visit Moscow in need of the three points to maintain their hopes. Lokomotiv looks more likely to get into third place instead of continuing their Champions League adventure.</p>
      <p>Wednesday is the day of the champion. Strengthened at the top of the Premier League after beating Crystal Palace in London, Liverpool hosts Napoli, who are also looking to advance. <b>Jurgen Klopp's team will be in the Round of 16 if they beat Carlo Ancelotti's team</b>. They can also tie for first place, although it depends on Salzburg's results, who play Genk in Belgium. Meanwhile, the Belgians have yet to win and currently have one point. </p>
      <p>Barcelona host Borussia Dortmund. Separated by a point, both consider qualification to be feasible. The Catalan team, which won in Leganés and secured the lead in La Liga, aims to leave behind the shaky performance against Slavia Prague. The Germans are going through a rough patch after a very shaky start in the Bundesliga, they managed to go back from a 3-0 to Paderborn, a team usually in the relegation zone, and have now lost Paco Alcacer to injury. The team to win will obtain their ticket to the next round, while a draw could also help Barcelona if the other match in the group - Slavia against Inter - also ends in a draw. </p>
      <p>RB Leipzig and Lyon can also qualify for the next round. Rudi Garcia's Lyon, who beat Nice in Ligue 1 to reach the top, will go to St. Petersburg to face Zenit. If they win, a spot in the Round of 16 is assured. </p>
      <p>Group H is the most evenly matched. Chelsea, Ajax and Valencia have seven points. The Spanish team host Chelsea. Whoever wins will qualify. The Dutch team, who are worse off in a triple draw, can't secure a pass, but they will step forward if they leave Lille with three points.</p>
