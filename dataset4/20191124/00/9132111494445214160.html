      <p>The Chief Executive Officer of Lotus Detox &amp; Wellness Center, May Meskawi Kalmoni has underscored the need for people to embrace body cleansing as she posits the process, among other things, rejuvenates the body and helps with long-term weight management.</p>
      <p>According to her, there are essential life routines that are becoming a luxury for a large number of people especially those who are determined to make it in life. Unfortunately, these routines have negative effects on the body hence, the need to detoxify.</p>
      <p>“We nowadays live in a world that is full of challenges, where keeping up with life pace and its demands causes lots of stress, we are no more connected to nature and its resources as we were created to be. Despite technological advancement, most of the products of technology that are very useful to our life, are found to be harmful in a way or another to our health. The number of people suffering from chronic disease, obesity, depression and cancer are increasing over the years. Even children are now increasingly diagnosed with such diseases at a very early age,” she said during the launch of Lotus Detox &amp; Wellness Center.</p>
      <p>Using her life as an example, Meskawi Kalmoni mentioned that the poor state of health she got into in her early forties, mainly due to life stress combined with chronic disease, made her learn the hard way that her life priorities and her perception of health were very wrong.</p>
      <p>She said: “During my healing journey I trusted to try every alternative therapy, whether traditional or modern, in various centres around the world and to adopt lifestyle changes recommended by therapist, mainly my diet. The most shocking discovery was the concept of body cleansing and detoxification that was never familiar to me but when tried, it greatly improved my health.”</p>
      <p>Having experienced a relief through detoxification, Kalmoni said she thought of establishing a professional detox centre in Ghana that offers internationally and traditionally tested natural approaches to wellness that are available abroad.</p>
      <p>As she puts it: “The challenge of putting up a competent team and the needed services to make this dream come true wasn’t easy this year but now I can finally say that Lotus Detox and wellness centre is able to provide its customers with a range of services combining ancient wisdom and latest technologies.”</p>
      <p>On his part, Maher Kheir, Ambassador of Lebanon, who graced the occasion lauded Kalmoni and emphasized that, “We need such a center today, to preserve our spiritual balance, in a world where all balances are shaken.”</p>
