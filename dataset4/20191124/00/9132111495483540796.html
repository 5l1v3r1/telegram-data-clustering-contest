      <p>The Shai Osudoku District Assembly has held its special town hall meeting on the upcoming District level Elections and referendum, to enlighten the public on the December 17 referendum and also to whip up interest in the election and rally the people towards achieving a higher voter participation during the exercise.</p>
      <p>Traditional authorities, security agencies, Heads of Department, representatives of political parties, students, traders, youth groups among others, partook in the meeting aimed “to discuss extensively what the referendum entails so as to clear any doubts and confusion.” The town hall meeting held at the Presbyterian Church, Dodowa was on the theme “Delivering a ‘YES’ vote in the upcoming referendum to take local governance to another level of dispensation”.</p>
      <p>District Chief Executive for Shai Osudoku, Daniel Akuffo who quoted article 55(3) to back his call said, “Whilst the mainstay of the referendum is to decide whether or not to allow the active participation of political parties in district level elections, it is also to approve the amendment of article 243(1). The article 243 (1) gives a sitting president the mandate to appoint Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives. The amendment of the 243 (1) which will be decided in the upcoming referendum by electorates will mean that powers to appoint MMDCEs will be taken from the President and given to the electorate based on Universal Adult Suffrage.”</p>
      <p>The assembly chief, who described the exercise as a civic duty which allows citizens to participate actively in the governance process at the local level to contribute to development and shaping the reforms in local governance, called on the public to vote “YES” in the upcoming referendum for the proposed amendment of Article 55(3) of the 1992 Constitution which is seeking to make local government elections partisan.</p>
      <p>“I will entreat you all to come together as Ghanaians and with one accord, vote ‘Yes’ to cement our democratic system and also to choose the best candidates to lead the District’s Development,” said the assembly chief.</p>
      <p>On his part, District Coordinating Director for Shai Osudoku, Mr. Paul Mac Ofori urged the citizenry to commit themselves to the voting process and exercise their franchise very well. He gave the assurance that more education on the referendum will be held in the district to ensure that the citizenry were well informed about the process.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ofori also charged the citizenry to contribute their quota to the development of the Shai Osudoku District by honouring their tax obligations to the district and also took the opportunity to urge the people to participate more in community engagements in the district. The District Electoral Officer, Mr. Eric Ampadu Pabi who described the exercise as a civic responsibility, called on the people to go to the polls on the appointed date.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ampadu in his presentation on the purpose of the referendum on December 17, 2019 indicated that local government election did not allow political parties to endorse, sponsor and offer a platform to or in any way campaign for or organize a candidate seeking election to a District Assembly or any local government unit.</p>
      <p>He said mostly electorate were not interested in District Level Elections, forgetting that it was the place by-laws were made.</p>
      <p>He reminded them that Article 55(3) for the referendum is different from Article 243(1) for the election of MMDCES as such they should educate their people on the referendum on District Assembly and Unit-Committee elections and leave Article 243(1) to parliament. The District Electoral Officer explained that political parties can partake in all public elections including local government elections, that is election of Assembly and Unit Committee Members if the electorate vote ‘yes’ to the referendum.</p>
      <p>District Director of the Shai Osudoku National Commission on Civic Education, Madam Janet Wahiermeh took participants through the voting process.</p>
      <p>The NCCE director who underscored the importance of participating in the referendum said more than fifty of similar engagements had already been held in the district.</p>
      <p>Asked what will be done to further raise awareness about the exercise, she gave the assurance that more of such activities will be held in the churches, markets, information centers and with identifiable groups to create and enhance the required awareness.</p>
      <p>She announced that the official colour assigned by Electoral Commission for the referendum was Yellow for “YES” and Dark brown for “NO.”</p>
      <p>Nene (Dr.) Tei Djahene Korabo I Chief of Manya and Senior Asafoatse of the Shai State together with his associates joined the DCE in his call for a “Yes’ vote in the upcoming referendum.</p>
      <p>Nene (Dr.) Tei Djahene Korabo argued that a partisan election at the district level elections will enhance multiparty governance at that level since other parties, which otherwise did not have the chance to win national elections, will stand the chance of winning elections at the local level.</p>
      <p>Spelling out the importance of the referendum, Mrs Cornelia Asante-Obeng who is the District Information Officer said the exercise was aimed at ensuring that accountability of local government authorities would be made affordable and have the opportunity to participate effectively in governance.</p>
      <p>The referendum, she added, was also to aid development through the execution of key projects and programmes in the medium term development plans. “Let’s us all come out in our numbers to vote and approve the Article 55(3) of the amendment law”, she said.</p>
      <p>Article 55(3) states that Subject to the provisions of this article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower government units. Citizens would also be required to vote either “YES “to support the participation of political party in the election of MMDCEs or “NO” to hold back the existing system.</p>
      <p>The referendum requires that 40 percent of the total registered voters turn out to vote out of which 75 percent must vote in favour of the amendment to allow political parties to participate in the District Level Elections</p>
