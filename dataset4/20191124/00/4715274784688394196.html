      <p>Thailand is a predominantly Buddhist nation, but this did not stop the message of the leader of the Catholic Church from resonating. Speaking on Friday during his four-day tour, Pope Francis warned Bangkok’s youth against the temptations and pitfalls of technology. “We can be swayed by the voices of this world that compete for our attention,” he said on the last day of his four-day visit. These voices, which can be appealing and exciting, “will leave you only empty, weary, alone and disenchanted” in the long run, Pope Francis said.</p>

      <p>“Rapid technological advancements can open up immense possibilities that make life easier, but can also result in the growth of consumerism and materialism.” Pope Francis is known for reaching out to the downtrodden, but also for actively engaging the youth to keep the Catholic faith alive. Then again, the pontiff’s particular message is not limited to Thailand’s fewer than 400,000 Catholic faithful. Young people all over the world, Catholic or otherwise, have no experience or recollection of a time when technology was not there to help them navigate everyday life. Social media, for example, have allowed people to peek into the best versions of the lives of others, causing them to feel inadequate about who they are and what they have. Pope Francis’ message is not a hollow reminder from an 82-year-old religious leader. It is something that strikes deep into how well we can distinguish ends from means. Technology ideally helps make tasks easier, so that people could focus on the more important aspects of living. Meanwhile, educators and parents of whatever faith should echo the Pope’s call if they want to prevent succeeding generations from evolving into something they can no longer recognize.</p>
