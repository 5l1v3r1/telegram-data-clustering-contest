        <b>FRANKLIN, NH (AP) — Bernie Sanders, 78, has consistently remained among the front-runners in the Democratic primary with polling that has stayed strong despite his campaign- trail heart attack last month and the rise of top rivals Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But perhaps no state will test the Vermont senator's durability more than New Hampshire, where he trounced Hillary Clinton by 22 points in 2016 and now may find himself a victim of that success since repeating such a dominate performance seems unthinkable.</p>
      <p>Warren, 70, a senator from Massachusetts, is trying to erode Sanders' support among ardent progressives, while former Vice-President Joe Biden continues to woo the Democratic establishment, declaring during a recent stop in the state capital, Concord: “I plan on winning New Hampshire.”</p>
      <p>Yet another New Englander, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, could raise the state's stakes since he's already relatively well known here, despite just joining the race.</p>
      <p>And, with none of those candidates from nearby states running away with New Hampshire, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has moved among the front-runners — similar to his rise in Iowa.</p>
      <p>“I like what Bernie stands for,” said Jessica Pine, 42, who attended a Sanders' event Saturday in Franklin and is considering voting for him, Warren or Biden.</p>
      <p>“I'm not sure about the electability for him.”</p>
      <p>Polls in late October and early November show Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg all bunched together for the New Hampshire lead, with each seeing about the same level of support from likely primary voters.</p>
      <p>Sanders' Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir said in August he expected Sanders to win New Hampshire — which is expected to hold its primary on February 11, eight days after Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses — while insisting that falling short wouldn't spell catastrophe.</p>
      <p>“It gets harder if we don't win New Hampshire for sure,” Shakir said.</p>
      <p>Still, in September, Sanders ousted his New Hampshire state director, and a top adviser to the campaign in the state also left. On October 1, Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada.</p>
      <p>Since then, the Sanders campaign has shown more of a New Hampshire presence and announced earlier this month that it had 90 staffers here. Warren has more than 55 staffers statewide, according to a campaign aide.</p>
      <p>And, though voters at their respective events often name Sanders or Warren as among their top choices, the senators' campaign styles are far different.</p>
