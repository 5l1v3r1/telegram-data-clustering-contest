      <p>South African stores and consumers have embraced Black Friday, a US shopping event, and made it the biggest online shopping day in the country.</p>
      <p>Instead of waiting for Black Friday to arrive, many South African retailers have decided to spread their sales over multiple days.</p>
      <h3>Takealot</h3>
      <p>One of these retailers is <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday/328685-takealot-blue-dot-sale-up-to-60-off-tvs-gadgets-tech-products.html"><b>Takealot, which launched</b></a> an Early Access Blue Dot Sale featuring price cuts on many products before Black Friday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/industrynews/328275-takealot-blue-dot-sale-early-access-deals.html"><b>Takealot’s Early Access Sale</b></a> runs from 24-28 November and the company promised that these deals will not be beaten over the Black Friday period to give buyers peace-of-mind.</p>
      <p>Another retailer which decided to offer deals throughout the month of November is Superbalist.</p>
      <p>“This year shoppers get early access to Black Friday deals on selected days throughout November with Superbalist’s Black Friday Spoilers,” the company said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday/328007-big-pick-n-pay-black-friday-tech-specials.html"><b>Pick n Pay</b></a>, in turn, has launched Black November deals with new specials going live every Monday at 07:00 throughout the month.</p>
      <p>The retailer is offering discounts of up to 50% across various categories, which are valid for seven days or until stocks last.</p>
      <p>Here are the best pre-Black Friday specials from South African companies, ranging from tech products to online subscriptions.</p>
