      <p><b>TOCHIGI — </b>A 12-year-old girl who disappeared after leaving her house in Osaka on Nov 17 turned up Saturday at a police box in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture, saying she had been confined in a house by a man.</p>
      <p>According to police, the girl, Iroha Akasaka, appeared at the police box at around 1:30 p.m. Police said she wasn't wearing shoes. She told them she had escaped from a man’s house where another girl was also being confined, Fuji TV reported.</p>
      <p>Police went to the house and arrested a 35-year-old man as he was leaving with a 15-year-old girl. Police said both girls were in good health. Police said the man, Hitoshi Ito, a part-time worker, has denied kidnapping Akasaka whom he met on a social networking site.</p>
      <p>Police said the other girl in Ito's house was from Ibaraki Prefecture and been missing since June, but gave no other details.</p>
      <p>Iroha was last seen leaving her home in Osaka's Sumiyoshi Ward by her mother after having breakfast at around 7:30 a.m. last Sunday. She then exchanged text messages with a friend at 10:30 a.m. That was the last communication anyone had with her.</p>
      <p>Her mother took a nap after breakfast and awoke at around 11 a.m. When her daughter failed to return home in the afternoon, she tried calling her phone but it was apparently turned off. After contacting her daughter’s friends, she notified police Sunday night that Iroha was missing.</p>
      <p>Iroha told police she met Ito online on Nov 10 and that on the day she disappeared, agreed to meet him in a park near her home. Ito then took her by train to Oyama. Kyodo News reported Sunday that Iroha told police Ito he sent her a message asking her to come to his house in Oyama. He also told her that he was with another girl who had been in his house for about six months and that he wanted Iroha to be "a conversation partner" for her, Kyodo reported.</p>
