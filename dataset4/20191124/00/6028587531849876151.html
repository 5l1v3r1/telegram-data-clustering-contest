      <p>It’s an awfully late Thanksgiving this year. November started on a Friday, which means that the fourth Thursday comes nearly at the end of the month, messing things up for any manufacturer or retailer trying to project the shopping season from Black Friday to December 25. Said retailers, however, have realized they are unbound by convention, and so are just kicking things off a little early to compensate for the lack of shopping time. Best Buy’s Black Friday Deals are already live, for the most part, and that includes some excellent deals on Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. The PS4 deal is really the gem here, and it’s an easy buy for a certain sort of theoretical consumer that doesn’t already have it. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Paige-s-Bundle/431121707?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_VWo3qRSsnxyJR9AwUx0Mo38SUkn32n1dyShJV80&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_1442478&amp;clickid=VWo3qRSsnxyJR9AwUx0Mo38SUkn32n1dyShJV80">It’s $199 for a 1TB PS4 complete with <i>God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn </i>and <i>The Last of Us Remastered</i>, </a>three excellent games with at least a hundred or so hours of top-notch single-player action between them. If you’re a big fan of these sorts of games I suspect you already have a PS4, but if you don’t you likely also don’t care too much about having the best gaming tech out there. That means you’ve got years of excellent PS4 games to play at a miniscule price, and I envy you.</p>
      <p>Next up we’ve got Xbox One, which has two solid bundles on offer. <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-xbox-one-s-1tb-all-digital-edition-console-disc-free-gaming-white/6375659.p?skuId=6375659">The first is the Xbox One All-Digital Edition with <i>Sea of Thieves, Minecraft </i>and <i>Fortnite</i> for $149. </a>Note that while I list <i>Fortnite </i>there, it’s not really a deal as it’s free anyways: any console is a <i>Fortnite </i>bundle, on some level. Regardless this is a very cheap machine if you’re not interested in discs, and it makes a solid pair for Xbox Game Pass. Next up is a $199 1TB Xbox One S with <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, sort of like the PS4 deal but with one new game instead of three old ones. And while there’s not quite as much gaming to be had here as there is with the PS4 deal, there’s something to be said for having a new game. It’s a good gift for the Star Wars fan that wants to play Jedi and hasn’t had the opportunity to do so in ages.</p>
      <p>As for Switch: you’ll have to wait. There aren’t many real deals to be had on the thing this year, and the major bundle with <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> doesn’t come out until November 27.</p>
