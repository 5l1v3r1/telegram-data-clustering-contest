      <p>Spain will face Canada in Sunday’s Davis Cup final after Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez edged the hosts past Great Britain.</p>
      <p>A gripping semi-final saw the singles split and the tie came down to drama in the doubles on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Spanish duo, in front of a partisan crowd in Madrid, survived a major test as Nadal and Lopez needed two tie-breaks to fend off Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski.</p>
      <p>With Andy Murray roaring on the British team from courtside, his older brother and Skupski pushed Nadal and Lopez through two intense sets before falling just short, losing 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (10-8).</p>
      <p>The British pair had set points to take it to a decider, but Spain, and Nadal in particular with one sublime overhead after a brilliant reach, produced their best when the pressure was at its greatest.</p>
      <p>It was always likely Britain would need Kyle Edmund to win his singles rubber and he duly delivered with a 6-3 7-6 (7-3) win against Lopez – a late stand-in for the injured Pablo Carreno Busta.</p>
      <p>But Nadal coasted to a 6-4 6-0 beating of Dan Evans, who tailed off after putting up a valiant effort in the first set against his more illustrious opponent.</p>
      <p>And after the late-night doubles joy, with the contest finishing well after midnight, Nadal said: “I think we played a great match. ‘Feli’ served great the whole match and at important moments he did everything well.</p>
      <p>“Thank you very much to Feli and the rest of the team.”</p>
      <p>Lopez said: “There was a lot of drama today on the court. We are very pleased we somehow managed to play those points in a very good way.</p>
      <p>“It was a lot of drama but this is what you expect when you play this kind of match. I think we have a very good opportunity tomorrow to lift this cup.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Canada reached the Davis Cup final for the first time in their history by winning a similarly thrilling tie against Russia.</p>

      <p>Denis Shapovalov kept Canada in with a chance by beating Karen Khachanov 6-4 4-6 6-4 after Andrey Rublev overcame Vasek Pospisil 6-4 6-4.</p>
      <p>And the Canadian duo defeated their Russian rivals 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in a thrilling deciding doubles rubber.</p>
