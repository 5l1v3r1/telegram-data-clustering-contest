      <p>A nationwide test of the Emergency Mobile Alert will hit mobile phones across New Zealand tonight.</p>
      <p>The alert is expected to land between 6pm and 7pm and is part of a plan to ensure the Emergency Mobile Alert system works efficiently.</p>
      <p>A number of tests have been sent out since 2017 - some more successful than others.</p>
      <p>The first alert was sent in November 2017 and reached just 34 percent of cellphones in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Then in November 2018 another alert was sent - repeatedly in some cases - in error to Vodafone customers at 1.30am.</p>
      <p>A second test that day reached about 60 percent of cellphones - or about 3.6 million phones - which was a dramatic improvement from the first test.</p>
      <p>At the time Civil Defence Minister Kris Faafoi said international experience showed that once the alerts hit 70 percent penetration, a “critical mass” was achieved “in which you generate word of mouth that quickly spreads to just about everyone”.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s test alert will be sent by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management.</p>
      <p>About four million phones are expected to make “a loud noise” marking the annual national test.</p>
      <p>MCDEM director Sarah Stuart-Black said last year six that in 10 New Zealanders received the alert, and that number is expected to climb further today.</p>
      <p>She said those people whose mobile phones are capable of receiving the alerts can expect to hear a loud, penetrating sound, and a notification will display.</p>
      <p>The test alert will link to the Civil Defence website, where people can fill out a brief survey about how they experienced the alert.</p>
      <p>Survey results will inform future improvements to the system and gather feedback for mobile phone providers.</p>
      <p>Last month the system was used in Auckland during the fire at the New Zealand International Convention Centre which brought the CBD to a standstill.</p>
      <p>An alert was sent out by Fire and Emergency New Zealand during the incident - highlighting a feature of the system that can ringfence an area to receive the message and define the time it is active.</p>
      <p>The Emergency Mobile Alert uses cell broadcast technology, which is also used in a number of countries including the United States, Japan, Chile and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Stuart-Black said there was no need to subscribe or download an app.</p>
      <p>“All you need is a mobile phone that is capable of receiving Emergency Mobile Alerts, and a network signal,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It uses internationally proven technology that isn’t susceptible to overloading, which is vital when we need to rapidly alert a large number of people.</p>
      <p>“However, no form of technology is completely failsafe, so it doesn’t replace other alerting channels such as radio or social media, or the need to act upon natural warning signs. Remember – if an earthquake is long or strong, get gone.</p>
      <p>Not everyone will receive Emergency Mobile Alerts.</p>
      <p>“If you’re in a mobile coverage zone and don’t receive an alert, that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with your phone or the system,” Stuart-Black explained.</p>
      <p>“It may be because your phone isn’t compatible or doesn’t have the latest updates.</p>
      <p>“For phones bought overseas or parallel imported, your alert may display differently – for example, some may show up as “Presidential Alert”.</p>
      <p>“In local emergencies, only those in the geographically targeted area will receive it.</p>
      <p>As Emergency Mobile Alert is about keeping people safe, no one can opt out.</p>
      <p>“Your phones may show optional settings used in other countries, but in New Zealand we will use a special broadcast channel that is permanently on,” said Stuart-Black.</p>

      <p>If you feel your life is in danger, don’t wait for an official warning.</p>
