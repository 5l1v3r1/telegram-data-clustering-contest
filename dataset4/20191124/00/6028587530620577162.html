      <p>Chocolate isn’t exactly a health food and yet as this time of year we eat tons of the stuff.

      <p><b>For the beauty expert</b> - Beauty calendars have exploded this year and Amazon’s has gotten the most inches so far. Stocked full of items worth over $250, it’s a huge present for anyone.
