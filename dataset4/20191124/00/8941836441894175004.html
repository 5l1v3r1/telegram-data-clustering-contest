      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - New York City transit officials say a person surfing a subway train - meaning lying on top - was found dead in a Queens station.</p>
      <p>The victim was struck at about 9 p.m. Saturday at Queensboro Plaza on an elevated No. 7 train.</p>
      <p>The person’s age and identity were not immediately released.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority says the station was totally closed for hours during an investigation. No. 7 and N trains bypassed the normally very busy Queens stop.</p>
