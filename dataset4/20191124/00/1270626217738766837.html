      <p>Two more people in Samoa have died in the measles outbreak that's killed 22.</p>
      <p>Samoa's Ministry of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said 153 new measles cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 1,797.</p>
      <p>Radio NZ reports about 92 percent of the 147 people being treated at health facilities are children, with 11 critically ill children in intensive care.</p>
      <p>One couple have lost three of their five children. The majority of the infected are on Upolu island.</p>
      <p>The ministry said a mass vaccination campaign was launched on Wednesday and more than 10,128 people have since been immunised.</p>
      <p>Other measures include barring pregnant women who are unvaccinated or uncertain of their vaccination status from work, travel restrictions between the two main islands and public gatherings being restricted under a state of emergency.</p>
