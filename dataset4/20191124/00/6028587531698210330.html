      <h1>Saudi Arabia Opens Its Doors To Tourists—Starting With A Huge Giga Project Around A UNESCO World Heritage Site At Diriyah</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">James Asquith</a></address>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has long been a mystery to many would-be tourists around the world. When I last visited nearly a decade ago there were no tourist visas and primarily a business-oriented infrastructure for foreigners. In 2019 everything changed. Electronic tourist visas were introduced and one of the hottest destinations to now visit is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In a world where social media makes us feel so familiar with the far-flung destinations of The Maldives and Bali, increasingly tourists are craving new and cultural experiences.</p>

      <p>Almost out of nowhere Saudi Arabia opened its doors, and it hasn’t slowly crept them open, the Kingdom has flung them open to tourists from around the world.</p>
      <p>From personal experience when I last visited compared to my recent trip, very little had changed in terms of attitude and perception. People are very friendly, Saudi Arabia feels very safe, and the local population have big ambitions. Before tourist visas were introduced with ease, very few people knew much about what the country had to offer.</p>
      <p>This is a nation steeped in culture and tradition and now a clear message has been sent that Saudi Arabia is not only open for business but tourism too. Most tourists will arrive through Riyadh and Jeddah which serve as great bases to explore some of the stunning beauty here from the ‘Edge of the World’ to Al-Soudah and Madain Saleh.</p>

      <p>Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has ambitions to see tourism contribute 10% to GDP by 2030, and what that means is that the world is about to see one of the most ambitious and rapid development projects since Dubai developed into the city it is today over a 20 year period.</p>
      <p>With the Kingdom looking to expand its tourist numbers rapidly to 30 million annually over the next 12 years, there has already been marked progress in infrastructural growth. This nation is looking forward, not backwards when it comes to their ambitions. With theme parks already signing contracts in Saudi Arabia and a commitment to build 500,000 new hotel rooms, the Kingdom is looking to offer tourists more options, whilst maintaining its cultural heritage.</p>

      <p>Diriyah is one such example of a giga project that is being constructed just outside of Riyadh. The huge development that will lay first ground in January 2020 already comes with one huge advantage for attracting tourists, and that is the fact that Diriyah is located around a UNESCO World Heritage Site. At-Turaif lays at the heart of a project that will offer entertainment, housing, hotels and educational facilities aiming to become a city within itself.</p>
      <p>What is noticeable about Saudi Arabia’s ambitions versus other rapid development in GCC nations is that there is a very strong desire to keep cultural heritage at the heart of their growth. The Turaif district where Diriyah is situated was the first capital of Saudi Arabia and has deep historical and cultural relevance. This will form the centrepiece of growth, but the most fascinating part of the path Saudi Arabia is taking is the recognition that culture and history can coexist with progress and development.</p>

      <p>People in Saudi Arabia are talking as much about what the country has to offer today, as they are about what it will look like in just five years from now. I sat down with Jerry Inzerillo, former CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, who has been tasked with making Diriyah the centrepiece of growth and development in the region.</p>
      <p>“There is only one Diriyah,” Inzerillo said with a beaming smile as he talked with enthused elation about what the world is about to see from its most recent tourist destination.</p>
      <p>The ambition around Diriyah is to preserve and develop one of the world’s largest and most important cultural heritage sites, said Inzerillo. The setting “transcends tourism” and the Crown Prince intends to keep the site’s historical integrity whilst developing a tourist oasis of hotels and strongly investing in education. A Formula-E racetrack and 15,000 seat arena will be developed around open spaces, museums and galleries.</p>

      <p>Away from the rapid development in the UAE, the world has rarely seen such grand ambitions of development on a rapid scale so far this century and Inzerillo described the site’s investment in education as a “serendipitous moment.”</p>
      <p>With 68% of the Saudi population under the age of 40, the development of Diriyah isn’t simply about tourism. Local development and historical preservation for the Kingdom are what makes the outlook so exciting.</p>

      <p>Diriyah Gate witnessed its Royal Inauguration this week and if the huge pyrotechnics and fireworks show is anything to go by, this giga project will grow to be a world-class travel destination.</p>
      <p>On all my travels to every country in the world, rarely have I seen such a large scale project devoted to tourism that is already making such rapid progress. Could Saudi Arabia be the tourist destination of the year in 2020? With the rapid growth and unwavering support for such giga projects as Diriyah Gate, tourist arrivals into the Kingdom are only going one way. Higher.</p>
