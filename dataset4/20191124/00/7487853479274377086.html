      <h1>Championship Roundup: Boro Draw Piles Pressure on Woodgate, West Brom &amp; Leeds Win, Preston Slip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15203443" target="_blank">Adam Aladay</a></address>
      <p>We've had another fun filled weekend of Championship action to enjoy, with all 24 teams taking to the field for matchday 17.</p>
      <p>In the final game of the weekend, ​<b>Hull City</b> scored twice in four minutes to earn a 2-2 draw with ten-man <b>Middlesbrough</b> at the Riverside Stadium, increasing the pressure on under-fire boss Jonathan Woodgate.</p>
      <p>Marcus Tavernier put Boro ahead in the seventh minute when he turned in a Paddy McNair cross, before Ashley Fletcher doubled the advantage 20 minutes later to put 'Boro on course for a first win in ten matches.</p>

      <p>However, Marvin Johnson was shown a straight red card for a rash challenge towards the end of the first half and from then on, Hull began to dominate proceedings. They took their time in finding the back of the net, but once they did through Jarrod Bowen, they didn't take long to find it again - Bowen again the man to strike four minutes later.</p>
      <p>The result moves Woodgate's Boro side out of the Championship relegation zone, but only on goal difference. Hull, meanwhile, now sit 14th in the table. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Charlie Austin scored an 88th-minute winner from the penalty spot as <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-bromwich"><b>​West Bromwich Albion</b></a> maintained their two-point lead at the top of the table. Hal Robson-Kanu had given the home side the lead until Steven Fletcher equalised for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/sheffield"><b>​Sheffield Wednesday</b></a> from the spot. </p>

      <p>However, with two minutes remaining, Matheus Pereira was brought down in the area and Austin netted the penalty. Defeat for Sheffield Wednesday sees them drop to ninth in the table.</p>
      <p>There was further late drama in the match between <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leeds">​<b>Leeds</b></a> and <b>Luton</b> on Saturday, as Matt Pearson's late own goal handed the three points to the Peacocks. The win sees Marcelo Bielsa's men extend their unbeaten run to six games and move up to second in the table ahead of Preston North End. </p>
      <p>As for <b>Preston</b>, they fell to a 1-0 away defeat at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/derby"><b>​Derby</b></a> on Saturday, with Martyn Waghorn scoring the all-important goal for the hosts. This was the Rams' fifth successive home win, who now find themselves sat 11th in the table. As previously mentioned, Leeds have now moved above Preston in the table, who are third. </p>

      <p>In the Friday night clash, Aboubakar Kamara struck twice for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/fulham">​<b>Fulham</b></a> as they beat London rivals <b>Queens Park Rangers</b> to move up to fourth in the table. Jordan Hugill gave the away side the lead after only three minutes, but the Cottagers came back strongly to take all three points. The result sees QPR drop to 12th.  </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/swansea"><b>​Swansea</b></a>, meanwhile, fell to their fourth defeat at home in six matches, after Jed Wallace's free-kick ensured <b>Millwall</b> left with the win and continued their revival under Gary Rowett. The result sees them move up to tenth, while Swansea now sit sixth.  </p>
      <p><b>Bristol City</b> drew 0-0 with ten-man <b>Nottingham Forest</b>, who had Ryan Yates sent off after just 34 minutes. Forest are now fifth in the table, whereas the Robins missed the chance to climb the table and are now seventh. </p>

      <p><b>Huddersfield</b> and <b>Birmingham</b> drew, as did <b>Charlton</b> and <b>Cardiff City</b>.</p>
