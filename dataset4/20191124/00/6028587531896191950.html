      <p>TNC Predator have won the first <i>Dota 2</i> Major of the season in Chengdu, China, taking down ViCi Gaming 3-1 in the grand final. TNC Predator entered the competition on a bit of a hot streak, having just won the $300,000 ESL One Hamburg tournament and managed to continue their impressive performances right from the start of the Chengdu Major. They topped Group A, beating both Team Unknown and EHOME 2-0 to advance to the main event, and then took down Alliance and J.Storm 2-1 and 2-0 respectively. </p>
      <p>This then set up a meeting with ViCi Gaming in the winners bracket final, and shockingly TNC were defeated 2-0, although the second game was a 63 minute epic. The loss knocked them down to the lower bracket where they faced off against Invictus Gaming, and quickly took them out 2-0, setting up a rematch with ViCi in the final. </p>
      <p>Despite losing 2-0 to ViCi just 24 hours before, TNC were clearly the better team on the final day of the competition, winning the first two games of the best of five final in under 34 minutes. Game three went ViCi’s way, but it was all over after game four with TNC taking another win to become the first major champions of the 2019/2020 season. </p>
      <p>Throughout the tournament TNC made use of the Morphling and Earthshaker combination that has been so prevalent on the current patch. The two heroes when paired together create quite the combo and many players have said that it is somewhat overpowered. TNC managed to use this strong combo to their advantage and really showed just how strong it can be at times. </p>
      <p>However, with a new patch expected in the coming days you can be sure that both heroes will be nerfed significantly and the combo probably won't be seen at the pro level again, or at least not as frequently as it has been over the past few weeks. </p>
      <p>Winning the MDL Chengdu Major gives TNC $300,000 and of course 4,850 <i>Dota</i> Pro Circuit Points that gives them a great shot at making it to The International 10 next year. However, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see them a little lower down the field for the rest of the season, as many of the top teams such as reigning world champions OG have elected to sit out the first major. But even if TNC don’t have another great performance at a major, with this total of DPC points you would still fancy them to claim a direct invitation to TI. </p>
