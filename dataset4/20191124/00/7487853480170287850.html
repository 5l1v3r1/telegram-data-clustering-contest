      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino Among Borussia Dortmund Managerial Targets as Pressure Mounts on Lucien Favre</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is one of four targets lined up by Borussia Dortmund to replace under-fire boss Lucien Favre in the forseeable future, according to reports in Germany - with Niko Kovac, Roger Schmidt and Ralf Ragnick also under consideration. </p>
      <p>Favre's side started the season well, but were thrashed 4-0 by Bayern Munich prior to the international break, and found themselves 3-0 down at home to Paderborn upon their return to Bundesliga action - though a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6502664-borussia-dortmund-3-3-paderborn-reaction-as-die-schwarzgelben-produce-sensational-comeback">​remarkable second-half comeback rescued a 3-3 draw</a>. </p>

      <p>A point at home to the division's bottom side did little to lift the mood around the club, however, and the word from Germany suggests that a positive result is required in <a href="http://90min.com/teams/borussia-dortmund">​Dortmund</a>'s next outing against Barcelona to <a href="https://bulinews.com/news/3954/report-under-pressure-bvb-coach-lucien-favre-has-one-game-save-his-job">​prevent the manager's sacking</a>. </p>
      <p>Should they fail to attain that, a report from <a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/fussball/bvb-wer-lucien-favre-als-trainer-beerben-koennte-66236064.bild.html">​Bild</a> has named the four men in the frame to take over the reins - with former Tottenham boss Pochettino, who was sacked and <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6500761-jose-mourinho-officially-named-new-tottenham-head-coach-until-2023-after-stunning-pochettino-sacking">​swiftly replaced by Jose Mourinho</a> last week, capturing the imagination. </p>
      <p>Pochettino's reputation has been damaged after a dismal start to the season in north London, but he has plenty of credit in the bank after overseeing one of the most successful periods in the club's recent history, underlined by their run to the Champions League final last season. </p>

      <p>Kovac, meanwhile, found himself relieved of his duties in Munich after a sketchy start to the season with the Bundesliga champions, but remains a highly-respected coach in Germany for his work with Eintracht Frankfurt. </p>
      <p>Former Leipzig coach Rangnick and former Leverkusen boss Schmidt - neither of whom are currently in work - complete a promising-looking shortlist. </p>
      <p>There remains a possibility that Favre could turn it round, however, and negate any talk of potential replacements. Though his side sit in sixth place domestically, they are just five points from top spot and have a couple of favourable fixtures against Hertha BSC and Fortuna Dusseldorf immediately following their trip to Camp Nou. </p>

      <p>The question may be, then, whether or not Favre can survive beyond their penultimate group fixture and earn the chance to prove he is still the man for the job. </p>
      <p>If not, then there is no shortage of alternative options waiting in the wings. </p>
