      <p>MY darling, precious, glorious, dignified, world-famous and heavenly celebrated Nigerian sisters,</p>
      <p>I keep receiving messages from pregnant girls over and over again telling me they want to go for an abortion as they can’t cope with the pain and trauma that would come with the pregnancy! After convincing them not to terminate the pregnancy, they come back and tell me they just had an abortion!  Like they just took paracetamol to cure their head-ache! Do these types of girls ever think of the future? Do they have any conscience at all? When I emphasize the importance of sexual purity, a good number of you send me wonderful messages thanking me for “saving your lives,” only for some of you huge fans to turn your backs against my counsels!</p>
      <p>Here’s what one of my mentees sent to me after I encouraged her to keep another pregnancy to no avail! She wasn’t even sure who’s it was at first!  Read her-</p>
      <p>“He gave me native medicine to drink and told me that it makes pregnant women to strong and healthy. I took the medicine and after a short while, I began feeling excruciating pains in my stomach such that I couldn’t even walk. Before I knew it, I was bleeding and he drove me to Maitama hospital! When we got there, I was given an injection and 3 drips (intravenous fluid) then my system became calm. After the third one, some sharp instruments that looked like iron and scissors were inserted in me to bring out blood from my body. That’s how I aborted it ma.”</p>
      <p>Lord have mercy! A man got you cheaply to have sex with him and had the guts to convince you to take a concoction that terminated the pregnancy you were carrying! What is this world turning into? Does he think he would get away with it? Hmm…girls…girls…girls (shaking my head)!</p>
      <p>I have an aunty whose flower girl I was in 1995 and till today she’s still SEARCHING for a child in her 50’s. Most times I see her, she’s coming from church, and she’s been to all the prayer mountains, yet not one single conception in the last 24 years! I have seen some of world’s most beautiful and fantastically accomplished women cry in pain and do unimaginable things just to conceive to no avail! Can you now imagine a young lady who won’t stop sleeping around (even after several admonitions) getting pregnant, informing me and after telling her not to commit another abortion, she writes me “Mummy, I terminated the pregnancy today-my boyfriend gave me something to drink…”</p>
      <p>I’m sorry girl but I think you have a big problem and can only pray God would have mercy on you before you destroy yourself! That was not your first abortion and you won’t stop messing around! HOW CAN YOU BE POPPING PREGNANCIES LIKE BALLOONS? A WHOLE CHILD?</p>
      <p>Girls…girls…girls, if you’re so determined to terminate a pregnancy and wouldn’t take to my counsel, please don’t ever inform me! It’s your choice but please for my sanity’s sake-I don’t want to know! I’ve experienced this from 2 ladies in 1 month! It’s cruel and horrifying! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!</p>
      <p>Abortion is a sin of great magnitude in the eyes of God because it entails the shedding of human life, innocent blood, a destiny and carries its consequences. Also, who knows what special assignment the terminated child was sent to carry out in the world? Perhaps a prophet sent to save his generation. King Solomon was a product of adultery, Apostle Paul’s young protege- Timothy was commended for his great kingdom works in the bible but his father was never mentioned, his grandmother- Lois and mother- Eunice were mentioned! Who knows how he got into the world? IF YOU DON’T WANT TO FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION YOU CAN’T HANDLE, WHY FORNICATE? What values would you give your children in future if your wombs are still intact?</p>
      <p>I pity a lot of girls who terminate pregnancies; they can’t all get away with it. DO YOU KNOW THE TYPE OF PAIN BARREN WOMEN GO THROUGH? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN YOU’RE DESTINED TO HAVE? STOP IT, STOP IT, PLEASE STOP IT IN GOD’S NAME!</p>
      <p>May God surprise every woman looking for the fruit of the womb before the end of this year! May we not lose our children and may god arrest the hearts of our girls, may they not suffer barrenness in Jesus name!</p>
