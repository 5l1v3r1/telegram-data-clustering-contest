      <p>After ten games, the Carolina Panthers are where many prior to the season might have guessed they would be at this juncture – a mid-pack (5-5) NFL team with their 2019 fortunes still to be determined. How Carolina fares in the season’s final six weeks could have an outsized impact on the team’s composition well into the next half-decade.To get to .500 this season after tailspinning last year into a seven-game losing streak, some things have certainly gone right for the Panthers. Ron Rivera and the team’s front office deserve credit for seeing the team’s most glaring offseason need – bolstering an anemic pass rush – and correcting it quickly. Carolina through ten games was tied for the NFL lead in sacks with 39, after registering just 35 in the entirety of the 2018 season. Returner Mario Addison leads the team with eight, while top draft pick Brian Burns has 4.5. Down linemen Gerald McCoy, Dontari Poe, and Vernon Butler each have four.</p>
      <p>On the shorter clock provided by its pass rush, the secondary has also improved. The team totaled just 13 interceptions last year and already has 12 this season. They’ve also had an easier team keeping opponents out of the end zone – the secondary yielded 1.88 TDs per game through the air last year and has reduced that number substantially to just over one (1.1) per game this season.</p>

      <p>Offensively, Christian McCaffrey is having an MVP-caliber season and leads the league in rushing yards (1,059) and yards from scrimmage (1,576). He looks poised to carry the offensive load for the team through the remainder of its schedule, and by doing so will diminish any immediate need to obtain a running back to help keep him effective by providing more than occasional relief.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomflynn/2019/10/19/carolinas-kyle-allen-quickly-gaining-poise-at-23/#1a0e22d4959c">Quarterback Kyle Allen surprised early</a> and has disappointed of late. His first five NFL starts (extending back to 2018) were all wins, and he went that span without throwing an interception – a tandem of stats that was a first in league history. In his last four games he’s been intercepted nine times, including four last week in a disappointing 29-3 loss to a 3-7 Falcons team.</p>
      <p>Allen earns $475,000 a year and is the lowest-paid starting quarterback in the NFL. How he does in the next six games will help determine if he is a bargain or an inexpensive replacement playing to form. Despite his struggles of late, many in the organization, <a href="https://www.panthers.com/news/it-s-a-much-different-scenario-but-kyle-allen-is-returning-to-new-orleans-lookin">including Rivera,</a> think Allen is the former.</p>
      <p>Starter Cam Newton remains sidelined (with a Lisfranc foot injury) at a cost of $21.1 million against the team’s salary cap this year. The Panthers would stand to save $19.1 against its 2020 salary cap if they trade or release Newton at any point next year, but releasing him before June 1 will have an additional impact on his future dead cap hit to the franchise.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1190257089018548230">NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport tweeted</a>, “QB Cam Newton hasn’t played since mid-September &amp; his sprained foot is not getting better. He hasn’t done more than rehab to the side...Playing football is a long way off.”</p>
      <p>His pace of recovery in these upcoming weeks will determine if his foot injury is a long-term health concern in addition to ongoing questions about his shoulder, and will have a critical impact on how the team views his health relative to its 2020 salary cap time clock.</p>
      <p>On the sideline behind Allen remains Will Grier, the team’s 2019 third-round draft pick from West Virginia. Starting Grier would signal a lost campaign, as there is little impetus to move under center a quarterback who is the same relative age (24) as Allen (23) and who, like Allen, is in a best-case scenario securing his place as a backup to Newton. Allen has already established that he is a serviceable backup and benching him would leave the more important question unanswered of whether or not he can be relied on to start if Newton fails to return, or returns in diminished form.</p>
      <p>If the team plummets in the remainder of 2019, there could be wholesale changes that will likely include the dismissal of Rivera, who has a 76-61-1 mark since taking the helm of the team in 2011. Owner David Tepper, the billionaire hedge fund manager who acquired the team in 2018, has yet to develop a long-term profile for his decision-making in regard to NFL personnel changes.</p>
      <p>That too will begin to take important shape in the next six weeks.</p>
      <p>After Sunday’s game against New Orleans (8-2), the Panthers host the Redskins (1-9), travel to face the Falcons, host the Seahawks (8-2), and close out the 2019 campaign with a final game against the Indianapolis Colts (6-5) at home.</p>
