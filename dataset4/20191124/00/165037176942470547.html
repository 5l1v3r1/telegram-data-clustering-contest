        <b>The Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo is looking forward to the Champions League game against Atletico Madrid this Tuesday. He wants to add to the six goals that he has scored this season and put an end to the physical problems that he has been suffering at the start of this competition.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He will do so against <b>Atletico Madrid</b>, a team who think he is a real<b> nightmare</b> after he has score 25 goals in 33 games against them and also eliminated them from the Champions League last year, after scoring a hat trick in the final 16.</p>
      <p>These memories are so vivid for Atletico,<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc"> Juventus </a>and Cristiano, who agreed with Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri <b>to rest on Saturday's league visit to Atalanta </b>to get full of energy for the European event.</p>
      <p>Sarr<b>i does not have the slightest intention of excessively relying on Cristiano </b>at this point in the season and wants the 34-year-old Portuguese to recover fully in order to get back to his best self for the remainder of the season.</p>
      <p>In fact, CR7 chas played in recent months, despite having suffered <b>muscle injuries, </b>which meant that he missed out on the game against Brescia on the 24th September. He has also suffered a knee injury which meant he missed out on the game at Lecce, which ended a draw (1-1).</p>
      <p>"In the last three weeks I've been conditioned.<b> I've always tried to help Juventus, </b>playing even when I was injured. <b>I'm still not 100%, but I'm used to sacrificing myself both for my club and for my national team</b>," Cristiano said last week during the training session with Portugal, where he sealed his ticket to UEFA EURO 2020.</p>
      <p>So far, Cristiano has<b> scored five goals Serie A</b> against Napoli, Hellas Verona, Spal de Ferrara, Bologna and Genoa, and scored<b> just one in the Champions League</b> in the home game against Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
      <p><b>His last goal came against Genoa</b> on 30 October, when he scored and converted a 95th-minute penalty to give Juventus three points and keep them at the top of the standings, a position they currently hold one point clear of Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>After this goal, the difficulties began for the Portuguese, who <b>was substituted twice in a row</b> before the international break, in the games against Lokomotiv Moscow (Champions League) and Milan (Serie A).</p>

      <p>In particular, when he was replaced by Argentine Paulo Dybala against Milan, <b>Cristiano went straight to the dressing room</b> instead of sitting on the bench with the rest of his team-mates, who ended up winning 1-0 with a goal from this replacement.</p>
      <p>A reaction to which Sarri downplayed importance, stressing that these are issues that can happen on a football field and<b> have no significance.</b></p>
      <p>In the last two weeks, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano</a> started with<b> Portugal </b>and scored four goals, three against Lithuania and one against Luxembourg, and returned to Turin eager to relaunch his campaign and improve his goalscoring numbers.</p>
      <p>After resting this weekend, CR7 will be looking to return to his best self in his favourite competition, a Champions League that he has won five times, and against a team that he has repeatedly sunk in the top European competition.</p>
      <p><b>He scored a goal against Atlético </b>in the 2014 Lisbon final, a penalty in the 2016 Milan final, a hat-trick in the 2017 semi-finals before<b> lifting the Champions League trophy </b>in Cardiff, and another hat-trick last year in the last 16.</p>
      <p>It will be up to Atletico to<b> find an antidote to resist Cristiano's desire for revenge </b>as he resumes the challenge of taking Juventus by the hand to a European Cup he has lacked since 1996.</p>
