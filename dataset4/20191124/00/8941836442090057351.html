      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Longtime producer and director <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arthur-marks/">Arthur Marks</a>, who helmed many episodes of the “Perry Mason” TV series and produced several hit blaxploitation films, died at age 92.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arthur-marks/">Marks</a> passed away Nov. 13 at his home in Woodland Hills, California, his son <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-marks/">Paul</a> said Saturday.</p>
      <p>“My brother and I learned everything about the film industry from my father,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-marks/">Paul Marks</a>, who is a TV producer. “He was a pillar of the industry. He taught us the morals of the industry and how to treat people.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arthur-marks/">Arthur Marks</a>’ grandparents and parents worked in the film business, and he grew up in it.</p>
      <p>Marks was the director and producer of 80 episodes of “Perry Mason.” He also directed episodes of the TV shows “I Spy,” “Mannix” and “The Dukes of Hazzard.”</p>

      <p>He made several films aimed at black audiences in the 1970s. They include “Detroit 9000,” which was re-released in theaters in 1998 by Quentin Tarantino, and two films starring actress Pam Grier: “Friday Foster” and “Bucktown.”</p>
      <p>“I believe when you put in the mix; a good script, a terrific cast, an experienced and perceptive director and a professional production what is the result? A film that audiences will enjoy and play eight weeks in a downtown theater in Chicago, Detroit or Kansas City,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arthur-marks/">Marks</a> said. “My intention was never to sell my films as a “black” film, rather a film that will damn well entertain for 120 minutes…with excitement, passion and a heart moving story.”</p>
