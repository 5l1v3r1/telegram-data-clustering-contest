      <p>Vice-Chancellor of the University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA), Professor Abednego Feehi Okoe Amartey has announced that a new campus for the University will open at Amanfo near Bekwai in the Ashanti Region in 2020.</p>
      <p>He made the announcement during his welcome address at the UPSA Annual Leadership Lecture and thanked the founder of the institution, Nana Opoku Ampomah for the 35-acre land which will host the new campus.</p>
      <p>The annual lecture which was themed: ‘Leadership: Strengthen Democratic Institutions for National Development’ was part of the launch of UPSA’s 55th Anniversary.</p>
      <p>Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene who was in attendance of the event gave the keynote speech at the event.</p>
      <p>Others in attendance were high profile personalities such as former President John Agyekum Kufuor, Nana Otuo Siriboe, Omanhene of the Juabeng Traditional Area and Chairman of the Council of State.</p>
      <p>The leadership lecture was instituted to strengthen the stature of the university as it strives to improve on scholarship, research and professionalism.</p>
      <p>Prof Amartey said, “As a professional institution, one of the finest gifts we can give our nation is to provide a platform like this to reflect on leadership and how we can use leadership to push a progressive and prosperous national agenda for all.”</p>
      <p>“For a country that is part of a continent that many say needs good leadership rather than charity, this is the least we could do; with the hope that these intellectual engagements will be seeds that will grow to bear good fruits and impact this generation and beyond,” he continued.</p>
