      <p>Twenty-three bodies were recovered on Sunday after a small plane crashed on takeoff into a densely populated area of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, rescue workers said.</p>
      <p>“We are up to 23 bodies now,” Goma rescue service coordinator, Joseph Makundi, told AFP.</p>
      <p>Goma Airport official, Richard Mangolopa, told AFP no survivors were expected from the disaster.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 aircraft had been headed for Beni, 350 kilometres (220 miles) North of Goma when it went down in a residential area near the airport in the east of the country.</p>
      <p>“There were 17 passengers on board and two crew members,” airline staff, Heritier Mamadou, said.</p>
      <p>The airline company has three planes serving routes in North Kivu province.</p>
      <p>One of the company’s maintenance workers at the site blamed a “technical problem” for the incident.</p>
      <p>The number of casualties on the ground was not yet known.</p>
