      <p>Regional Minister of the newly created North East Region, Solomon Namliit Boar, has lauded Akufo-Addo for his significant role in uniting the people of Dagbon after many years of conflict between the Andanis and the Abudus.</p>
      <p>According to him, the peace in the region is currently attracting both foreign and local investors into the region, this he says will go a long way to ensure development and to also promote the region.</p>
      <p>This he says, is enough reason for investors to flock the region, capitalize on the gold which is in abundance now in the North East Region to expand business and grow the economy.</p>
      <p>â€œ...the issue of disunity now belongs to history. It now peace, progress. It has started attracting a lot of investors. We want to use this opportunity to call on all investors to really try their best and begin to flock into that area because they are a lot of untapped potential. If you go to North East Region today, there is abundance of gold to feed this country. If it is also about tourism, name it we have a lot of them.</p>
      <p>The regional minister who was praising Akufo-Addo after the Damba Festival said the resolution of the dispute led to the eventual enskinment of a new Yaa-Naa earlier this year, thereby paving the way for the celebration of the festival; an act which will go down memory as it the first time both parties have come together in the past 17 years.</p>
      <p>After 17 years of waiting, the Overlord of the Dagbon Traditional Area, Yaa-Naa Abukari Mahama II, celebrated the annual Damba Festival with splendour in Yendi in the Northern Region last Saturday.</p>
      <p>A protracted chieftaincy disagreement that pitched the Abudus against the Andanis and threatened the peace of Dagbon prevented the celebration of the much-cherished festival in the traditional seat of Yani (Yendi).</p>
      <p>The resolution of the dispute led to the eventual enskinment of a new Yaa-Naa earlier this year, thereby paving the way for the celebration of the festival.</p>
