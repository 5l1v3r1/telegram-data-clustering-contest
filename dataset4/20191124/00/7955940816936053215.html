      <p>The Swans on the Green deli and coffee shop has been granted a five year planning permission for the construction of a modular structure, single storey extension to the existing food preparation area of the shop, on the Ballymore Eustace side of the premises.</p>
      <p>It will also encompass toilet facilities, all located to the eastern side of the existing shop and all associated site works.</p>
      <p>This permission is to accommodate ongoing trade at the site while work on a permitted expansion takes place.</p>
      <p>In December 2017 Swans got planning permission for the demolition of a two storey house and outbuildings and an extension to the food preparation area.</p>
