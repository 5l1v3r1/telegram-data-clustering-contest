      <p>Genoa - <a href="http://www.themeditelegraph.com/en/transport/road-rail-air-transport/2019/11/24/bridge-collapses-the-highway-that-connects-savona-turin-5WnRA53q0bZHCZJ9iTwfGP/index.html">Another bridge collapsed </a>on the roads of northern Italy. A year and a half after the tragic collapse of the Morandi bridge (which caused 43 deaths), life in<b> Genoa, the most important Italian port city</b>, has not yet returned to normal. On 1 October construction began on the new bridge, designed by the internationally renowned architect Renzo Piano. The works are managed by a consortium between Fincantieri and Salini Impregilo and should be completed by April 2020. <br/><b>The new viaduct should be open to the public in early 2021,</b> but times are not yet certain. Under the pillars of the new bridge, then, a park designed by Stefano Boeri will rise, which will help change the appearance of the neighborhood that was demolished to allow reconstruction. 43 trees will also be planted in the park to commemorate each of the victims.<b> The new Genoa bridge </b>will be 1,067 meters long and will have 19 spans. It will rise exactly where the old viaduct was located, near the main Genoa access road to the west, and will be painted white. It should cost around 202 million euros.</p>
