      <p>Christina Carbonell and Galyn Bernard, founders of Primary, a gender-neutral children’s clothing company, are revolutionizing the $30 billion kids’ clothing industry by making their clothes quality-driven, simplistic and reasonably affordable. </p>

      <p>“We view ourselves as like the Lego or the Crayola of kids clothing,” expresses Carbonell. “Simple styles that are meant for everyone. You can't go wrong in how you wear them. There are other things out there you can add on to that just like in the toy world for example.” The idea of Primary came from the frustration Carbonell and Bernard felt while shopping for their children. Personal pain-points rose while they were pushed toward a specific product based on gender. For example, boys' clothing was only available in blue, green, orange and red, while girls' clothing was only available in pink, purple, teal and white. They felt that the market was very prescriptive for no reason and aspired to build a brand based on the things they wanted for themselves and their children.</p>
      <p>From plain white t-shirts being out of stock to having to wait for a 40% sale in order to pay a reasonable price for a pair of leggings, these founders were bewildered as to why there wasn’t a more simplistic approach to children’s clothing. Since 2015, Primary produces clothing that are inclusive and free of bows, glitter and graphics. Instead, their collection is classic in design and comes in a rainbow of colors and patterns for babies and kids. </p>
      <p>Initially, Carbonell and Bernard met while working at Quidsi where they previously led marketing for Diapers.com and went on to launch and manage nine additional e-commerce sites in categories such as toys, home and children's clothing. “The focus for us there was really building like an amazing shopping experience for busy parents around obvious replenishment items like diapers and wipes and formula,” Bernard states. “We were very proud of the experience we built. It felt elevated and easy and we were huge customers of the brand ourselves. Honestly, shopping for our kids in the clothing market at the same time, it felt like why isn't there something that's easy and sort of solution-oriented for kids clothes, which was about this sort of online experience, but also just about the assortment, where we wanted our kid’s favorite clothes to be available.”</p>

      <p>In 2010, Amazon acquired Diapers.com. At that point, Carbonell and Bernard joined the management team. However, no matter what project they worked on or every time they shopped for their children, they couldn’t stop thinking about the idea of building out Primary. Then in 2014, the two colleagues left Amazon and built out their own company.</p>
      <p>“In terms of building the company itself,” Carbonell shares, “we were lucky to have been able to see what it took to build a company from pretty much the beginning to over a $500 million company. With that came a lot of insight, including how to build a team, and a culture around that team that we were able to maintain from very small to very big. As part of that, a key thing we brought with us was a balance between a super driven, high performing team that also values respect and kindness in how we treat each other. That was really important to us.”</p>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges they faced when first starting the company was the difficulty of actually designing the apparel. “We hadn't had apparel industry experience and didn't hire someone early on who did,” Bernard humbly shares. “We talked to everyone we could in our network and tried to figure out some solutions. That was really hard. We didn't expect to navigate that in a way that was so difficult. It took us 18-months to realize this is just not something that we're gonna be able to figure out on our own.” The industry is relationship dependent. They understood that they had to expand their network if they were going to make it work. Eventually, they hired someone who understood the garment industry and could reach the desired vision. Bernard continued, “it felt scary to invest a good amount in a really strong team leader, but we wish we had done it earlier.”</p>

      <p>As Carbonell and Bernard evolved and expanded their company, they focused on the following essential steps to help with all their transitions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put your ego aside. Your focus has to be on what you are trying to build and your ego will slow down the process.</li>
        <li>Have an alternative plan. Sometimes what you think will work doesn’t. Don’t quit — pivot to a new strategy or idea.</li>
        <li>Understand your strengths and weaknesses. Build a team who compliments your weaknesses. You’ll be able to go further when everyone has a different skill set. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>“We definitely didn't come to this with huge bank accounts,” Bernard concludes. “We're just going to figure this out. We're really hustling. There are ways to do this that don't need huge connections and celebrity status and all of that. It requires crazy passion for an idea. And, a lot of conviction and a lot of heart and soul and blood and all the things that can make it work just as well.”</p>
