        <b>While most Plus or Max versions of modern smartphones tend to be larger versions of their smaller siblings with occasionally an additional feature or two, Samsung is apparently plotting a different route for the upcoming Galaxy S11+. The flagship, due early next year, will be a big change from the design of the regular Galaxy S11 that has already slipped out, according to one notable leaker of Samsung information.

      <p>As we covered last week, the purported <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-design-of-the-Galaxy-S11-will-have-people-scratching-their-heads.444002.0.html">design of the Galaxy S11</a> has divided opinion. However, the Galaxy S11+ is claimed to be more than just a bigger brother to the Galaxy S11 as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Smartphone-Review-Optimised-SoC-promises-better-runtimes.433424.0.html">Note 10+</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Smartphone-Review.410629.0.html">Galaxy S10+</a> were to the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Smartphone-Review-Still-the-best-business-smartphone.433161.0.html">Note 10</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Smartphone-Review.414549.0.html">Galaxy S10</a> respectively. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce">Ice universe</a>, all known information about the Galaxy S11 does not apply to the Galaxy S11+. Instead, the leaker with a Blue Russian cat as its avatar <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1197858156002430978">wrote to fans</a>:</p>
      <p>S11+ is a very mysterious existence with almost no leakage. It may be Samsung's real nuclear weapon.</p>
      <p>They followed this by urging people to "look forward to" the Galaxy S11+ and opined that were some obvious differences between the two handsets. While Ice universe has proven a reliable leaker of information about upcoming Samsung smartphones, we expect that this one may prove somewhat wide of the mark. The shortage of information that they shared about what sets the Galaxy S11+ apart from the Galaxy S11 should raise eyebrows alone. Indeed, some fans have been quick to dash the claims, while others have jokingly suggested that the device may explode as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-7-Smartphone-Review.174550.0.html">Note 7</a> infamously did.</p>
      <p>We already expect the largest device in the Galaxy S11 series to feature a larger screen, RAM and potentially storage options than its smaller siblings. Samsung even reserved the use of ceramic for the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Smartphone-Review.410629.0.html">Galaxy S10+</a>, so we doubt that Ice universe would class these as obvious differences if they already exist on the Galaxy S10 series. Perhaps, Samsung will showcase something like an under-display camera on the Galaxy S11+, or a new type of battery technology. Ultimately, we shall discover more in the coming months, but Ice universe has already set expectations high.</p>
