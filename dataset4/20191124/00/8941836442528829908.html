      <p>All eyes will be on Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old pop star, who has continued to publicly battle with the men who own her master recordings, is set to take the stage at Sunday’s show - a performance she recently said was put in jeopardy by Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun. Swift could also make history at the AMAs if she surpasses Michael Jackson’s record for most wins.</p>
      <p>Swift, who has won 23 AMAs, is nominated for five awards and could best the King of Pop’s 24 wins. Swift will also receive the artist of the decade award, to be presented by Carole King, at the show, which airs live on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT.</p>
      <p>Swift is nominated for the top prize - artist of the year - along with Ariana Grande, Drake, Halsey and Post Malone, who is the leader with seven nominations.</p>
      <p>The second most-nominated acts are Grande and newcomer Billie Eilish, who both scored six nominations each.</p>

      <p>Swift will compete for favorite female pop/rock artist, favorite adult contemporary artist, favorite pop/rock album for “Lover” and favorite music video for her equal rights anthem, “You Need to Calm Down.”</p>
