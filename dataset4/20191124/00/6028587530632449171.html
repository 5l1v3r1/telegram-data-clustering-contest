      <p>History is not fixed. It involves multiple narratives, collective memories, with photography enacting a crucial role in navigating this. <a href="https://www.emericlhuisset.com/">Émeric Lhuisset</a>’s lens sets out to do just the journey. The French visual artist is concerned with the disappearance of civilizations and with the displacement of people. He is capturing the human story of war and loss of homeland. His subject is the humble refugee. He wants us, the viewer, to see beyond the headlines, to read the image and to see the person behind the migrant, the refugee, the immigrant, the émigré.</p>

      <p>Lhuisset is the latest talent to be supported by BMW through the carmaker’s photographic residency program at Gobelins L'École de L'Image, the prestigious school of visual arts in Paris. And I’ve come to the French capital to meet the artist at his latest exhibition “L’autre rive” (The other shore) staged at the annual international fair, <a href="https://www.parisphoto.com/en/Home/%5C">Paris Photo</a>, where BMW is an official partner.</p>

      <p>The BMW Residency is now in its eighth year. “Supporting photographers is a long-term approach,” says Thomas Girst. As head of BMW cultural engagement, he helps locate exciting artist and offers support to their work without any creative interference. <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/culture">BMW Art &amp; Culture</a> works with numerous world organizations and event - Tate Modern, Art Basel, Frieze Art and Art D'Égypte to name a few. What the car company gets from this exchange is associating with arts and ideas – elements of which will naturally feed into the thinking within the organization.</p>

      <p>Lhuisset’s subject, the refugee, feels like a brave choice for a big car corporation. Girst agrees. “He deals with images of war and refugees and it is very brave of BMW to support his work. What he does is so real - he brings depth to photography,” he continues. “It shouldn’t always be just about beauty and aesthetics, but how these subjects come into play when the world turns ugly.”</p>
      <p>Lhuisset documents real stories. Having studied geopolitics and fine art, the Parisian then travelled to Turkey and Syria, working as a photographer and artist in war-torn Kurdistan “I am interested in the reconstruction of Iraq after the war and so I initially went to Kurdistan because it was safer at the time. This is how I met the people and discovered their stories.”</p>

      <p>His work isn’t straightforward war photography though. Curated alongside the artistic director of BMW Residency François Cheval, the images and scenography on show here - some staged, some real, some disappearing – form a collective narrative. It works much like a moving image as we follow the journey of a refugee from the battlegrounds of Kurdistan to the harrowing journey across the Mediterranean and as a refugee in Europe.</p>
      <p>“What interests me is this idealization of the freedom fighter in western society,” explains Lhuisset. “Most governments here have a heroic vision of the Kurdish fighter, but at the same time they mostly see the refugee as a parasite. For this exhibition, I worked with real Kurdish soldiers on the battlefield and as refugees in Europe, and within the seven years I photographed them, they go from hero to parasite. So how can we change our perception of a person when they cross the sea? I’m interested in the construction of this vision, and I’m trying to deconstruct this vision.”</p>

      <p>The exhibition opens with two powerful images from Lhuisset’s “Théâtre de guerre” (Theatre of war) series. The photo-paintings were staged physically in Iraq, where the artist asked a group of Kurdish guerrilla fighters to act out their battle scenes – replacing their reality with that of a classical painting. “I took inspiration from the paintings of the Franco-Prussian wars, which influenced the representation of war photography,” he explains. “This was a defeated war and so showed scenes of the real soldiers fighting not only the victory of the generals.”</p>
      <p>He admits the execution was terrifying with the process taking only fifteen minutes before they all ran for shelter. Yet, the images are central to the exhibition. “I am interested in the question of reality, the construction and theatricalization of the war picture. These images look fake, because the movements are adapted from a painting, but they are photographed in a place of war using real fighters.”</p>

      <p>A shaky hand-held video depicts the crossing between Syria and Turkey - the journey taken by those fleeing the war and “the moment when the same people become refugees,” says Lhuisset. The photograph that follow then captures a small section of the sea where many migrants disappear.</p>
      <p>“We want to support young talent with our BMW Residency,” says Vincent Salimon, CEO of BMW Group France. “This year’s topic is related to actuality. The risk we take each year by choosing a winner without knowing what work they will produce during the Residency ensures that we will surprise the public.”</p>

      <p>The exhibition concludes with a series of fading blue renderings, made through the old process of cyanotype. “I wanted to create pictures that will gradually fade,” explains Lhuisset. “The blue monochrome becomes a double metaphor - the sea where so many lives are lost, where a lot of refugees disappear. But it is also the color of Europe, and the refugees who make it, will be part of the future of Europe.”</p>
      <p>Ultimately Lhuisset’s work is a mediation on humanity, or the possibilities of humanity. He writes of this body of work: “It’s a story of a friend, the story of people I met, of a many-sided territory, a territory in which buried histories are tangled with one another. It is a reflection on the disappearance of dissident voices and individuals, of architecture and cultures, even entire peoples. It is a story of a territory built on disappearance.”</p>
