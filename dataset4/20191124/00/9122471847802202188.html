      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:11:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Notre Dame came a away with a big time 40-7 win over Boston College on Saturday. The Fighting Irish are still vying for a NY6 Bowl game selection. Saturday’s outcome should held ND move up in next week’s rankings.</p>
      <p>The Fighting Irish now shift their attention to next Saturday’s contest against Stanford. But quarterback Ian Book is having to face a few more distractions. Saturday’s Boston College game was Notre Dame’s last home contest of the season. As a result after the game, a reporter asked Book if this was his last home game as a part of the Fighting Irish.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to gauge what Book is going to do next season given his brief response. But he doesn’t deny the speculation that he could depart for the NFL following the season. With such a loaded draft class at QB though, it may be wise for Book to stick at Notre Dame for another season.</p>
      <p>The Fighting Irish quarterback has shown flashes of brilliance at times this season. Book’s thrown for 2,532 yards and 29 touchdowns compared to just six interceptions in 11 games.</p>
      <p>Should Book stick around for another season with Notre Dame?</p>
