      <p>Earlier this month, we were graced with the first Western release of the classic role-playing game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romancing_SaGa_3"><i>Romancing SaGa 3</i></a>. So it seemed only fitting to talk with the people behind the series and this latest release.You may remember that I interviewed the director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaGa"><i>SaGa</i> series</a> a while back. Specifically, that of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/12/14/akitoshi-kawazu-on-his-journey-from-the-final-fantasy-games-to-the-saga-series/">Akitoshi Kawazu</a> around the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romancing_SaGa_2"><i>Romancing SaGa 2</i></a> was given a similarly excellent remaster and Western release.</p>
      <p>Naturally, I wanted to know how the release of <i>Romancing SaGa 2</i> went and this time around the producer of the <i>SaGa</i> series <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,279002/">Masanori Ichikawa</a> was also on hand to give some answers.</p>
      <p>“Firstly, <i>Romancing SaGa 2</i> was the first title to be released overseas after the reboot of the <i>SaGa</i> series. To be honest, we barely did any overseas promotion outside of interviews, but many people picked up a copy of the game. I can’t reveal exact numbers, but in terms of sales for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PC, we’re closing in on about the same number of units sold between Japan and overseas. It’s a staggering number for a game that hadn’t been previously released overseas. Additionally, hardcore fan’s messages reached us in Japan, which served as a catalyst for us to move forward with the release of <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i>, which had never been released overseas before.</p>
      <p>“I assumed the reactions would be quite different between Western fans and Japanese fans, but I didn’t see any big difference in the fact that the fans were enjoying the game. But I do feel that the Western fans are much more passionate and their fever has reached us over here in Japan.</p>
      <p>“We chose to remaster this title because it is an especially popular title within the whole of the <i>SaGa</i> series. Even though it was the most popular of the <i>Romancing SaGa</i> games, it had never been re-done before, even in Japan, so we wanted to bring it back for modern players worldwide.</p>
      <p>“For a while there was a quiet period for the <i>SaGa</i> series in the Japanese market, but in recent years we’ve had re-releases of titles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaGa:_Scarlet_Grace"><i>SaGa Scarlet Grace</i></a> and <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/saga_reuniverse/"><i>Romancing SaGa Re-univerSe</i></a>, which has led to fresh appreciation, with old-timers re-playing them, as well as a new influx of new players who may not have experienced the series before. As the series was comparatively late in moving overseas when compared to other franchises, we wanted to get the international version of <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i> out alongside the Japanese release.”</p>
      <p>For those that aren’t well versed in the <i>SaGa</i> series, Ichikawa was happy to explain how <i>Romancing SaGa 2</i> and <i>3</i> differ.</p>

      <p>“<i>SaGa</i> series games are all standalone titles. As such, there are absolutely no issues with starting off with <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i>. This is the same as <i>Final Fantasy IV</i>, <i>Final Fantasy V</i> and <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> being standalone titles. <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i> tells a “free-form scenario” story that is woven together by eight protagonists. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing old-school, robust role-playing games.”</p>
      <p>It was here that Kawazu gave his insight on how role-playing games have changed over the years and what games like <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i> offer the player.</p>
      <p>“I think the ability to enjoy a game over a long period of time is an important part of role-playing games. The much longer play time when compared to other game genres, such as action or shooting games, is a great advantage, and this is something that’s still true today.</p>
      <p>“The opportunity to dig into a story or a character is another appealing part of the role-playing game genre. I think that character creation, including great visuals, is still one of the greatest strengths of the Japanese role-playing game genre. I find that game systems in general are rarely changed and should be approached as something to question and try to improve. In a sense, the story and the characters are just a skin, and if the essence of the game itself remains unchanged, users will grow bored.”</p>
      <p>Ichikawa chimed in on his love of <i>Romancing SaGa 3 </i>and why it’s important to re-release classic games like this.</p>
      <p>“I consider <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i> to be a masterpiece, and I believe that masterpieces must be preserved. Even if resources are missing, no matter how much longer development takes than it did for the original, it’s a game worth bringing back to life and it must be kept from fading into the obscurity of history. This is my mission and I think that this remastered version has accomplished it.</p>
      <p>“I’m constantly thinking about what we can do to give players a new role-playing game experience and how to present the creations of Akitoshi Kawazu and the <i>SaGa</i> series dev team to them.</p>
      <p>“Making sure that they have a chance to experience <i>Romancing SaGa 3</i>, which has, for some, been kept from the light of day for 24 years, is one way of doing this.</p>

      <p>“Another way is doing the same with the most recent title, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/saga-scarlet-grace-ambitions-switch/"><i>SaGa Scarlet Grace: Ambitions</i></a>, which launched in Japan last year. To the rest of the world, we’re sorry it’s taken so long.”</p>
      <p>It’s clear that the release of <i>Romancing SaGa 2</i> and <i>3</i> are just the start of something bigger and bolder, as Ichikawa explained.</p>
      <p>“A famous Japanese game music composer once told me, “Truly great songs are fully appreciated with the passage of time. One of my songs which was originally a B-side has recently come back around and is now a huge hit.” I see the <i>SaGa</i> series as the same sort of thing.</p>
      <p>“When I was in school, I was a <i>SaGa</i> fan and it bothered me that even in Japan, it was less in the spotlight than other game series. I really wanted to do something about it. However, it’s not as though I tried to force the <i>SaGa</i> series back into popularity. That’s not the kind of producer I am.</p>
      <p>“If you look at all of the excitement surrounding the <i>SaGa</i> series, it’s clear that the fans are giving it the recognition it deserves and have just been waiting for the series to make its comeback. The release of the remastered version of <i>Romancing SaGa 2</i> in 2016 was the beginning, followed by Mr. Kawazu’s newest work, <i>SaGa Scarlet Grace: Ambitions</i>. It was the recognition and acceptance afforded it by the fans that got us to where we are today.</p>
      <p>“I feel sorry for the game fans everywhere that the <i>SaGa</i> series is not available to play the world over. I feel that it’s my mission to ensure that the <i>SaGa</i> series can be played anywhere, at any time, on the most current hardware and platforms. It’s only available in English right now, but someday, we would like to be able to make it available in a variety of languages. Not to mention bringing fans the next thing Mr. Kawazu and the <i>SaGa</i> series dev team have in mind. That’s my long-term vision.</p>
      <p>“I’m not the sort of producer to strong-arm things, so I want to hear from everyone. Whatever your feedback, be it that the game is fascinating or boring, I want to know. Try the <i>SaGa</i> series for yourself and tell me, on Twitter or anywhere else, what you honestly thought. This is what motivates both me and the rest of the <i>SaGa</i> series dev team to keep going.” </p>
      <p><i>Romancing SaGa 3</i> is now available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, PlayStation Vita, iOS and Android.</p>
