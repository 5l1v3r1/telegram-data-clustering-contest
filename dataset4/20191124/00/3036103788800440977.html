      <h1>The final fibre frontier in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Over the last decade, South Africa has seen excellent developments in international, long haul, and metro fibre networks, and it is now time to focus on last-mile fibre rollouts.</p>
      <p>This is the view of Octotel CEO Rob Gilmour, who spoke to MyBroadband about South Africa’s fibre network developments.</p>
      <p>Gilmour explained that fibre networks can be broken into four categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>International fibre</b> in the form of undersea cables, where South Africa is now well covered through multiple submarine cable systems.</li>
        <li><b>Long-haul national fibre</b> which connects South African towns and cities. The country has seen strong growth in this area and bandwidth pricing between major centres have fallen significantly in recent years.</li>
        <li><b>In-metro fibre</b> in the form or rings within cities and towns which supports fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-business deployments.</li>
        <li><b>Last-mile FTTH and FTTB fibre</b> where fibre is rolled out in neighbourhoods to connect houses and buildings to fibre and provide high-speed connectivity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to Gilmour, South African telecommunications companies need to focus on solving the last-mile problem as international, long haul, and metro fibre networks are in place.</p>
      <p>“The final frontier is to bring fibre connections into as many homes as possible to be effective in transforming our legacy of being a poorly connected country with relatively slow internet speeds,” said Gilmour.</p>
      <h3>The fibre war</h3>
      <p>Telkom may have started off with the high ground in the South African fibre war, but operators like Vumatel and Octotel delivered fast, efficient roll-outs which soon saw them competing with Openserve.</p>
      <p>This has resulted in Telkom rapidly losing fibre-to-the-home market share to operators like Vumatel and Octotel. However, Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/fibre/327807-telkom-not-losing-the-fibre-war-ceo.html">denies that they are losing the fibre war</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The Telkom CEO said they are currently focusing their investments on fibre-to-the-base-station, fibre-to-the-business, and to some extent, fibre-to-the-home.</p>
      <p>Telkom said in its latest annual report that it has a strong focus on fibre to the business and fibre to the base station because they have significantly higher ARPU than FTTH passed.</p>
      <p>He said the biggest prize for Telkom to go after is fibre-to-the-base-station to support its mobile data growth.</p>
