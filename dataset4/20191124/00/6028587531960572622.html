      <h1>Five Reasons To Love The World</h1>

      <p>It first set sail in 2002, and nearly 18 years later, the largest private residential ship on earth is still gong strong. There are countless reasons to pine after one of the 165 apartments on board <a href="https://aboardtheworld.com/">The World</a>; here are just five of them. </p>

        <b>1. A home on the water </b>
      </p>
      <p>Once you’ve bagged one of the 165 private apartments on board The World, (ranging from one-bedroom studios to sprawling three beds), it’s time to make it your own. Every resident on board The World is free to design their own interior, ensuring these apartments really do have the personal touch. The World is constantly on the move, so residents can watch the world go by from their private verandas, or head out to explore on land when the boat is in port. Thanks to its limited occupancy, the ship rarely gets too busy in the way a regular cruise might. So there’s no need to jump out of bed early to save a sunbed and no long waits (or any waits for that matter) for service. Many residents even have a ‘staycation’ by booking a night on one of the ship’s Bali beds, which offer an al fresco night under the stars, complete with privacy walls, retractable awnings and crucially, a phone for bedside service. Hot chocolate, anyone? </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Travel with no suitcase  </b>
      </p>
      <p>Every year, residents of the ship put their heads together to come up with a sailing itinerary for the next twelve months. Up to 120 ports are visited annually, ranging from cultural weekends in European cities to tropical beach breaks in the Caribbean. The icing on the cake? Three times a year, the boat embarks on a special expedition – giving residents access to some of the planet’s most remote destinations. Expeditions in 2020 include the Raja Ampat archipelago and Antarctica and there are also plans for a two-month circumnavigation of Australia, including an eight-day expedition in the remote Kimberley region. Evidence of the popularity of these trip’s can be found in the ship’s library (yes, there’s one on board), where beautiful photo books display highlights of recent adventures.  </p>

        <b>3. Food from around the world </b>
      </p>
      <p>Given that this ship is permanently on the move, there are always new and exciting places to eat on land – from freshly made pasta in Portofino to delicious dim sum in Hong Kong. That hasn’t stopped The World from pulling out the stops when it comes to eating on board though, and there is choice galore. Residents can take their pick from six restaurants, from swanky haute cuisine at Portraits, to poolside snacks at the Pool Bar. The boat’s chefs do food shops across the world, meaning that the ship’s menu offerings are often locally influenced and the ship’s award-winning wine cellar holds over 14,000 bottles, music to the ears of oenophile residents. Most apartments have their own kitchen too, so there’s also the option to buy local produce from the on board shop (or do a market shop on land) and experiment with some home cooking. Bon appetit!</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Stay active at sea </b>
      </p>
      <p>When your holiday has the potential to last for months at a time, it’s important to stay in shape. The World has this covered – and then some – with two swimming pools, a running track that skirts the perimeter of the boat (with views to thrill) and the only full-size tennis court at sea. There’s also a golf putting green (plus a simulator and a resident pro) and a gym with all the latest equipment. Naturally. The boat’s spa, recently renovated, is a total haven of relaxation, with hammam treatments, Thai massage room and steam and sauna rooms. When in port, residents can also try their hand at sailing and kayaking off the marina platform. Ship shape!  </p>

        <b>5. Learn as you go </b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most exciting aspects of the ship is its enrichment programme, helping residents to learn about local culture and delve into the history and traditions of a destination before they arrive. These experiences take place both on and off the ship. For example, when the boat arrives in Australia early next year, an art expert will come aboard to talk about Aboriginal art, while on land there will be a visit to the home of famed winemaker Chris Ringland, as well as a private backstage tour of the Sydney Opera House. There’s far more besides, including a Nobel Laureate Series, lecture program and all sorts of other workshops (acting class, anyone?) to ensure your mind stays active and engaged as you travel. </p>
