      <p><a href="https://www.vinerepublic.com/products/13330281/lagavulin-offerman-edition-11-year-old">Lagavulin Offerman Edition 11 Year-Old</a> – $US59.98</p>
      <p>Lagavulin 16 Year-Old may be a classic but the newly launched Lagavulin Offerman Edition is one of the most exciting releases of 2019, showcasing the close relationship between the Diageo owned distillery and actor, Nick Offerman. Offerman describes the new release: ‘Carrying the signature Lagavulin Islay single malt peatiness with sweet berry and orchard fruit notes, this Scotch whisky is for those who adore Lagavulin’s patented smoky flavour and the patience required to masterfully distil a single malt is what they told me to say, but I would rather just tell you that I am giggling with delight at the notion of people enjoying this limited edition Scotch.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/49749/balvenie-week-of-peat-14-year-old-stories-no2">Balvenie Week Of Peat 14 Year-Old</a> - $US80.00</p>
      <p>This release is one of three that came under a new series by the Balvenie distillery, the Balvenie Stories. The Week Of Peat is a special 14 Year-Old release, bringing subtle smoke and earth to the sweet, deep profile of Balvenie whisky. A greatly balanced dram, and one to enjoy over the holidays, as the weather starts to get chilly.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.whiskyshop.com/glendronach-cask-strength-batch-8">GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 8</a> - $US95.00</p>
      <p>That happy time of the year has come and gone, and the latest GlenDronach annual cask strength offering is here, now on its 8<sup>th</sup> batch. Each year is as exciting as the next, and this one offers a kick at a high 61% ABV. Master Blender, Dr. Rachel Barrie said: ‘The Glendronach Cask Strength Batch 8 is incredibly rich and full-bodied, the result of years of slow maturation in Pedro Ximénez puncheons, quarter casks and Oloroso sherry butts. Casks were individually selected, combined and bottled at natural cask strength to deliver maximum character and depth. I hope the most discerning palates will sip, savour and appreciate the full-bodied character of Cask Strength Batch 8.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/52114/aberfeldy-15-year-old-french-red-wine-cask-finish">Aberfeldy 15 Year-Old –French Red Wine Finish</a> - $US70.00</p>
      <p>The newest Aberfeldy release utilizes Pomerol red wine casks from Bourdeaux. The whisky matured initially in bourbon and re-char casks before spending approximately 5 months in the wine casks to bring forth some extra elements of flavour. According to Stephanie MacLeod, the distillery’s malt master: ‘Pomerol intensifies Aberfeldy’s signature honeyed fruitiness with luscious layers of red berries and stone fruits.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Auchentoshan-Sauvignon-single-finished-Exclusive/dp/B07XZGQB1G/ref=zg_bsnr_358583031_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=E0SBWWCGN61HPDPXQJCD">Auchentoshan Sauvignon Blanc –</a> $US65.00</p>
      <p>This new Auchentoshan release is an Amazon exclusive, yet another step for the global giant in whisky. The expression launched recently, on November 15<sup>th</sup>, and is meant to cater to white wine lovers with an interest in whisky. Eileen Livingstone, senior director of Scotch whisky for Beam Suntory who produced the exclusive, said: ‘Auchentoshan Sauvignon Blanc is a unique innovation that disrupts the category and provides consumers with a drinking experience out of the norm. This enables us to connect with urban millennials who are looking to sample new expressions and shared market experiences.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.royalmilewhiskies.com/kilchoman-str-cask-matured-50-70cl/">Kilchoman STR Cask Release</a> - $US100.00</p>
      <p>An innovative release by Islay’s Kilchoman distillery, this release uses the STR method, which stands for Shave, Toast, Rechar, a series of steps to treat a cask which previously held wine. This method was pioneered by the late Jim Swan. Anthony Wills, founder and managing director of Kilchoman, said: ‘The STR cask balances influences from both new and used oak to create a powerful combination of rich fruit, oak, spice and maritime peat smoke.’ A real treat for fans of peat and experimental finishes!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ailsa-Bay-Scotch-Whisky-70/dp/B07KQ25F6J">Ailsa Bay Sweet Smoke</a> 1.2 - $US72.00</p>
      <p>Ailsa Bay 1.2 comes after the distillery’s first release, at the same 48.9% ABV and featuring no age statement. The William Grant &amp; Sons owned distillery has huge production capabilities and has been around since 2007. The first Ailsa Bay single malt launched in 2016 and now the second release is here, offering more smoke and sweetness than the first. Only slightly higher sweetness and peatiness levels, but a fun experiment nonetheless.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Highland-Park-Valfather-70-cl/dp/B07X2LKJDR/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Highland+Park+valfather&amp;qid=1573640280&amp;sr=8-3">Highland Park Valfather</a> - $US70.00</p>
      <p>The Highland Park Valfather is the last in the distillery’s Viking Legend series, and the peatiest whisky to ever be released by the Orkney distillery. The global launch took place during summer 2019 in Taipei, showing the importance of the Asian market for Scotch whisky. The Valfather comes after Valkyrie and Valknut, and speaks of Odin, the leader of the Norse gods. At 47% ABV, Valfather packs a kick and maturation in refill casks allows the peat to shine through.</p>
