      <p>Coming into 2019-20, New Yorkers were hoping the Knicks ragtag collection of youngsters and vets would be able to exceed expectations and string together some wins. Alas, that hasn't been the case over the first month of the season.Saturday night was yet another frustrating and embarrassing night in New York.</p>
      <p>The Knicks welcomed the Spurs into Madison Square Garden. Usually, a visit from coach Gregg Popovich and company is a nightmare for the home folks. However, this is not your usual Spurs squad. San Antonio entered the evening riding an eight-game losing streak, the longest of the Popovich era. Also, Saturday was the back end of a road back-to-back for San Antonio, who had lost to the Sixers on Friday night. It was also their fourth game in six days, with all four away from home. Additionally, Spurs were resting their starting point guard, Dejounte Murray, who had lit up the Knicks for 18 points (on 7-of-10 shooting), eight rebounds, six assists and three steals in 24 minutes back on opening night in San Antonio.</p>
      <p>Sum it all up, and Las Vegas had installed New York as a three-point favorite. Then, the game started, and the Knick retreated. </p>
      <p>Heading into Saturday's game, San Antonio had allowed opponents to score more than 20 points in every quarter in each of their previous 13 games. That's 52 straight quarters. Yet, they held the Knicks to just 16 points in the first 12 minutes.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Spurs are the only team in the NBA that averages fewer than nine made 3-pointers per game this season. Yet, San Antonio waltzed into the Garden on Saturday and knocked down eight three-pointers in the FIRST HALF. A remarkable number of these triple tries were of the wide-open variety. They finished the game 12-of-23 from downtown. It was the first time all season (in fact, the first time since last February) the Spurs had shot better than 50% from behind the arc. </p>
      <p>By halftime, the Knicks trailed by 25 points, having given up 68 points while allowing the Spurs to successfully convert 59% of their FG attempts. The lead ballooned to 28 in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Saturday was the Knicks' eighth home game. Incredibly, and inexplicably, New York has trailed by at least 28 points in four of these eight home contests.</p>
      <p>The Knicks did make a run in the fourth quarter, which was spearheaded primarily by feisty point guard play. I'll use this as an opportunity to switch gears and highlight one of the few positives for New York, not only last night but all season. </p>

      <p>In the final frame alone on Saturday, Ntilikina had seven points (on four FG attempts), five assists (as many as the entire Spurs team combined) and two steals.  </p>
      <p>Ntilikina finished the game with a robust and well-rounded stats line: nine points, a season-high nine assists, three rebounds, one 3-pointer and six steals, matching his career-high.</p>
      <p>In the process, according to Basketball-Reference, the French Prince became the first NBA player since Andrei Kirilenko in 2007 to dish out at least nine dimes and rack up six steals without committing a single turnover. Of the 18 players in league history who have ever tallied a 9/9/0 game, Ntilikina is the youngest player (21 years, 118 days).</p>
      <p>Facilitating the offense and setting up teammates, while taking care of the basketball and hounding opponents on the perimeter has been the hallmark of Ntilikina’s play since entering the NBA. And, since being inserted into the starting lineup under dubious circumstances, he's shown the type of value he can provide to a competent organization.</p>
      <p>Over his last five games, Ntilikina is sporting a spiffy 23-to-4 assist-to-turnover ratio. Mike Conley is the only player with a better AST-TO ratio during this stretch. Ntilikina also has nearly three times more steals (11) than turnovers (4).</p>
      <p>Since entering the starting lineup earlier this month, the Knicks are averaging 107.6 points per 100 possessions with Frank on the floor (the best OffRtg on the team), versus just 95.4 points per 100 possessions when he's on the bench. Not bad for a player with a reputation of solely bringing value on the defensive end. During this 11-game stretch, New York has been outscored by more than 15 points per 100 possessions when Ntilikina is not in the game.  </p>
      <p>On the season, Ntilikina is the only player in the NBA with at least 50 assists, 25 steals and ten blocks, yet fewer than 20 turnovers.</p>
      <p>I'll leave you with one last cherry-picked doozy of a stat. Per Basketball-Reference, Ntilikina is currently on pace to become just the seventh player in league history to log over 25 minutes a night and post a steal rate of at least 3.0%, a block rate of 2.5% with a turnover rate of 15% or less. The other six players in this unique club are guys you may have heard of: Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Gerald Wallace, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard and Michael Jordan. </p>
