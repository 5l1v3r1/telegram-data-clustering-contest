        <p>Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted late Saturday that Lowndes County Sheriff <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-williams/">John Williams</a> had been “tragically killed” in the line of duty. State law enforcement authorities had issued what they called an “emergency BLUE alert” saying they were seeking an 18-year-old man last seen at a QV gas station in the area around the time of the shooting.</p>
        <p>The commander of the state troopers’ Montgomery post, Steve Jarrett, later confirmed the shooting took place at the QV station and that the person sought was a suspect in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-williams/">Williams</a>’ death. That person has been identified as William Chase Johnson.</p>
        <p>Lowndes County is just southwest of Montgomery. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-williams/">Williams</a> was first elected sheriff in 2010.</p>
