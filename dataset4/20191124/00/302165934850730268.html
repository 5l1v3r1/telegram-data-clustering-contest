      <p>LIMA, Nov 24 — Brazilian club Flamengo won the Copa Libertadores in the most dramatic fashion yesterday as they came from behind to beat defending champions River Plate 2-1 with two late goals from Gabriel Barbosa.</p>
      <p>River took the lead through Rafael Borre after 14 minutes and looked to be cruising to their fifth Libertadores triumph.</p>
      <p>However, Barbosa, the striker nicknamed Gabigol, tapped in from close range with a minute left and then rifled home from 15 metres to secure victory in an astonishing finale.</p>
      <p>The result gave Flamengo only their second Libertadores triumph and means they will represent the South American confederation in the Club World Cup in Qatar in December.</p>
      <p>The Rio de Janeiro clubs came into the match as slight favourites on the back of a spectacular 26-game unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>But playing in their first Libertadores final since 1981, they appeared overawed and River Plate seldom looked like relinquishing their lead as they outplayed and outmuscled their less experienced rivals.</p>
      <p>However, just when the match looked over, Barbosa popped up a minute from time to sidefoot home a close-range equaliser.</p>
      <p>And in a finish reminiscent of Manchester United’s last-gasp victory over Barcelona in the 1999 Champions League final, the striker pounced again in added time to hit the winner and send the Brazilian fans wild with joy.</p>
      <p>Barbosa was then sent off seconds before the final whistle, following a red card for River’s Exequiel Palacios.</p>
      <p>The final in Lima was the first to be played on a one-off basis at a neutral venue in the tournament’s 60-year history.</p>
      <p>The match had originally been scheduled to take place in Santiago but was switched to Lima earlier this month because of political unrest in the Chilean capital.</p>
      <p>The change came a year after the second leg of the final between River Plate and Boca Juniors was moved to Madrid after River fans attacked the Boca coach as it approached the stadium. — Reuters</p>
