      <p>Would you like to hear the best news ever? Nothing is perfect. Every system, process, interaction, mechanical apparatus, or digital flow, have frictions. These imperfections provide innovators, entrepreneurs, and anyone looking for new business growth with an opportunity to step to the plate and come up with a solution that generates value and revenues. To do so, you will need to have the ability to identify these frictions.  The framework I describe below will enable you to unlock new opportunities and solve frictions with the power of AI and IoT.</p>

      <h3>Follow The Process To Identify Problems And Opportunities</h3>
      <p>To identify imperfections and frictions in behaviors, processes, and other activity flows, let's start by drawing up the complete customer journey, supply chain, or process describing the flow of events from start to finish. The imperfections, frictions, and problems we seek to solve are hiding within this flow. This approach of detailing the entire process has been around for quite a while, and it is still around because it is a robust ideation tool that delivers reliable results.</p>
      <p>Here is an Example Of How This Tool Works: imagine an everyday process, such as getting prepared for a conference call. First, the person has to find her laptop, phone, and Bluetooth earpiece. Next, the search for an available conference room commences. Once she found an available room, she needs to connect to the office VPN and network. Following that, she will find the invite in her calendar and log on to the office phone conferencing app using a provided link. She may also need to connect her laptop to a projector or a screen in the conference room to share her slides with other participants. There will be a bit of fiddling with the air conditioner and lights, adjusting the shades, complaining about why those using the room earlier in the day left their coffee cups, and the call can commence.  </p>
      <p>If you were to think of your own experiences, or better yet, interview others about their experiences preparing for a conference call, all of the flows in the process would surface:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People tend to forget where they left their phone or Bluetooth earpiece, as the time of the call is getting near, the pressure of finding these devices increases. </li>
        <li>The laptop starts an untimely update process as the conference call begins.</li>
        <li>The empty office located for the conference call doesn't get a good WIFI connection; the participants can't connect to the phone conferencing app. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are just a few exemplary frictions that following the flow of events will help us identify. The more detailed the process, the more frictions we will find. With more frictions, the more opportunities we will have to innovate and generate business value by solving these frictions and streamlining the process.  </p>
      <p>The same process works for supply chains or manufacturing processes. Describe the entire process end to end, speak with people, and capture their experiences. By doing so, you will find all of the gaps, frictions, broken links, and generally, what does not work well.</p>
      <h3>Excellent Approach, But It Only Considers Humans</h3>
      <p>This type of approach is known as a "User-Centric" approach. We view the world and its problems through the keyhole of human experiences.    </p>
      <p>With this approach, we are not viewing the issue of connectivity to the office WIFI as a problem the laptop is experiencing. It is a problem the person experiences. A lost headset is not the fault of the Bluetooth earpiece, and we do not expect it should proactively help us locate it.  </p>
      <p>To solve frictions from a "Human Centric" approach, we will ask ourselves, "how might we solve this friction for a person" and not "how might we solve this problem for a device." </p>
      <p>We will come up with solutions providing users with better access, streamlining processes, providing users with better access to knowledge, or enabling users to self-serve themselves. </p>
      <p>As a result, our solutions are providing additional tools for the human user, such as an app to book rooms or a "Tile" style BLT tag to find lost items. Solutions will be found, but they will operate by relying on the active collaboration of the human user.</p>

      <h3>Now With AI and IoT Things Are Changing: Intelligent Automation Is A New Source Of Innovation</h3>
      <p>Today, with the advances of IoT and AI, we are presented with the opportunity to go through the same friction exploration process described above, but, to come up with a different set of solutions to the frictions we identify. This process is not intended to replace the excellent and proven tool of finding human-related frictions, but it is a new framework, we should add to our innovation toolbox.  </p>
      <p>The combination of IoT and AI creates a new and powerful capability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> IoT helps <b>connect the Cyber and Physical</b> worlds. It enables us to capture data that is descriptive of human behaviors, of activities within environments, of machine operations, and flows across supply chains. </li>
        <li>AI enables us to convert the data IoT captures, and turn it into <b>insights and actions</b>. With AI we gain new understandings of what is happening in the physical and digital worlds, and the <b>context</b> in which things happen. With these insights, we can take action. We can inform, alert, and even close the loop and operate assets in the physical world in an optimized way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These capabilities are called <b>"Intelligent Automation"</b> and are the big story of the next decade of digital innovation. If previously, when looking at processes and finding frictions, we asked ourselves "how might we solve problem X for <b>person</b> Y," with Intelligent Automation we can ask ourselves "how might we <b>automate</b> a process and make it <b>inteligent</b>?". By the nature of these questions, it becomes apparent that the solutions we will come up with will expand beyond the human user. We will be able to create Intelligent and Automated experiences and processes.  To make processes Inteligent and Automated we need data: data that is generated by physical assets and IoT, and data which has already been digitized and exists in databases, CRM systems and other digital media.</p>
      <p>Using Intelligent Automation, we can learn what is the best flow, predict the next steps, and take automated actions. We are moving responsibilities from the human user to machines by leveraging the power of Intelligent Automation. (more on this topic in this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hodfleishman/2019/09/29/how-to-stike-the-right-ballance-between-what-humans-and-technology-should-do/#5c5e70c160a4">post</a> )</p>
      <p>But how do we find opportunities for driving these actions? Let's go back to our chart on the wall, which describes a customer journey, flow, or process.</p>
      <p>We need to add two new rows below the flow we described. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first will describe the physical assets involved across the entire process. Physical assets can be made into data gathering devices using IoT.</li>
        <li>The second row will detail the data available across the whole flow. With available, or newly generated data, insights can be gained and we can take actions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the phone conferencing example, physical assets include the phone, earpiece, office, laptop, and the Wifi router. Data can include the location of the user, her laptop, phone and bluetooth device, meeting room ocupancy and the temperature in the room.</p>
      <h3>Now that we look at this flow, ask yourself two critical questions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>With the existing assets and available data, which behaviors, processes, activities, or environments can be made Intelligent and Automated to streamline the phone conferencing journey?</li>
        <li>Consider the gaps where there are no physical assets involved, and we are not capturing any data. Which sensory devices and data analytics capabilities can be added to the journey, to make it more Intelligent and Automated?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Looking at the phone conference example, when we consider Intelligent Automation, we can come up with new types of innovative ideas based on the capabilities of IoT and AI:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track and Trace the person and their assets: As soon as meeting approaches, if the person is not near her phone, the phone will ring and will reveal the location of where the earpiece was left last time it was used. </li>
        <li>Space Utilization: An office will be booked automatically based on a calendar invite. If sensors detect the room is occupied, facial recognition will identify who are the people in the room, and a polite reminer will be sent to each to leave the room as another meeting is about to begin.</li>
        <li>Self Maintnance: The WIFI hub will test it’s own connectivity, and order a repair if connectivity is low. </li>
        <li>Remote Operation: As soon as we enter the conference room, the phone conferencing connection will already be set up, as well as the temperature based on the participant's known preferences.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This approach will begin to float opportunities that will expand your portfolio of ideas by adding Inteligence and Automation to processess. It will help you grow your concept portfolio from ideas that focus on streamlining the activity flow of human users to concepts that focus on how Intelligence and Automation can improve the processes.</p>
