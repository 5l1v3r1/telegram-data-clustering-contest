        <b>CATADUPA, St James — Member of Parliament (MP) for St James Southern Derrick Kellier is calling on the Ministry of Tourism to establish an artisan village in Catadupa as one of the means “to breathe back some life into the once-striving community that has gone dormant”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ministry of Tourism has announced that the first artisan village will be completed in Falmouth, Trelawny, by the end of this year. The Trelawny facility forms part of the US$5.7-million Hampden Wharf Development Project, being funded by the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF).</p>
      <p>“We have heard the minister of tourism speaking of the creation of one artisan village already. Catadupa is the ideal place here in western Jamaica for an artisan village to be established. And we must push for it with the Government in support. The craft vendors who make their craftwork can come and do it right here in stalls around the railway,” Kellier said.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the recent launch of the Catadupa Development Benevolent Society (CDBS) in Catadupa, Kellier argued that “the demise that we have suffered right here was caused mainly after the railway had shut down”.</p>
      <p>He expressed confidence that the rail services will return and challenged members of the CDBS to seek funding from the Ministry of Tourism to beautify the square to welcome both locals and tourists.</p>
      <p>“The 'Appleton Train', as we used to call it, will be back, based on what Minister Bartlett has said. We look forward to hear more,” Kellier said.</p>
      <p>The Government, through the Ministry of Transport and Mining, in 2016 signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the United States company, Herzog International, to resurrect the railway service in sections of the island.</p>
      <p>The project, to be done in two phases, will start with the development of the Montego Bay to Appleton, St Elizabeth, leg.</p>
      <p>The St James Sothern MP also argued that National Hero, Samuel Sharpe, who hails from the Catadupa area, should be used as a draw for tourists to the community.</p>
      <p>“We must use the Right Excellent Sam Sharpe to help to bring people here in Catadupa,” Kellier recommended.</p>
      <p>According to Claudette Glegg, leader of the CDBS, the benevolent society is designed to, among other things:</p>
      <p>• facilitate the development and promotion of civic pride;</p>
      <p>• facilitate the provision of community infrastructure for the advancement of the community, including domestic water, roads, green space, health care, education, electricity, sports, cultural, social and economic development;</p>
      <p>• promote and coordinate sustainable community development programs and projects;</p>
      <p>• enhance the sustenance of the beautification of the community;</p>
      <p>• cooperate and associate with other bodies and organisations that have similar objectives;</p>
      <p>• to establish long-term partnerships with agencies; and</p>
      <p>• to undertake the establishment and management of community projects and fund-raising.</p>
      <p>“Ladies and gentlemen the vision is to capitalise on the rich legacy of Samuel Sharpe. He was born right here in Catadupa,” Glegg pointed out. “He walked these roads and bushes. He ate these same fruits and plants as we do. Therefore, Catadupa will be transformed with visitors coming to see our products and talents, as well as taking the trail to where the trash house was lit at Kensington Great House.”</p>
