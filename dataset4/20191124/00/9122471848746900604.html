      <h1>Clay Helton Has Message For USC Athletic Director Following Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:57:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Few head coaches have been on a hotter seat this season than Clay Helton. Almost everyone has thought that the Trojans would part ways with Helton following the year. USC has been linked to Urban Meyer, James Franklin and others for months.</p>
      <p>Is USC actually going to fire Helton, though?</p>
      <p>We might be trending in the opposite direction of that right now.</p>
      <p>USC topped UCLA tonight, 52-35, to improve to 8-4 on the season. The Trojans’ president actually congratulated the team on the win. You’re probably not going to fire your head coach right after publicly congratulating him.</p>

      <p>ESPN insider Adam Rittenberg is also hearing that Helton has internal support to return.</p>
      <p>“Clay Helton is doing what new athletic director Mike Bohn wanted and finishing strong. There’s momentum internally to bring him back. Will be an interesting week or two ahead. If Utah somehow stumbles tonight or next week, Trojans are in league title game,” he reports.</p>

      <p>Helton had a message for USC’s athletic director following the win, too.</p>

      <p>USC was presumed to be the biggest opening on the job market this offseason, and that’s still a definite possibility, but it’s looking like Helton might be back in 2020.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
