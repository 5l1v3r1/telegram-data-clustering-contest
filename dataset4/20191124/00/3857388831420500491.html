        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Bolivia's interim President Jeanine Anez on Saturday rejected an attempt by opposition senators to grant Evo Morales amnesty, a day after the country's ex-leader was accused of sedition and terrorism.</p>
      <p>"We have categorically affirmed that my government will not persecute any politician, union or civic leader," Anez told reporters.</p>
      <p>"But at the same time we are also clear that everyone who has committed crimes, has mocked the law, has committed abuses, will not have any amnesty."</p>
      <p>
        <b>BILL</b>

      <p>The proposal was introduced to the Senate by Morales' Movement for Socialism party on Saturday seeking to prohibit "judicial processes" against the ex-president and others.</p>

      <p>It comes on the same day Congress votes on a bill that could pave the way for new elections seen as crucial to ending weeks of unrest following the disputed October 20 ballot.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Arturo Murillo on Friday filed a criminal complaint accusing Morales of sedition and terrorism, after he allegedly called on supporters to maintain blockades in the crisis-hit country.</p>
      <p>Murillo referred the case to federal prosecutors in La Paz, who have opened an investigation into the allegations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RECORDING</b>
      </p>
      <p>The legal action comes after Murillo played a telephone recording to journalists on Wednesday, allegedly of Morales issuing instructions to a leader of the opposition movement in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>"Don't let food into the cities, we're going to block, really encircle (the cities)," says the voice Murillo attributed to Morales.</p>
      <p>If Morales -- who fled to Mexico after resigning on November 10 -- were charged and convicted, he would face a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail.</p>
