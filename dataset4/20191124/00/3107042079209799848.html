      <h1>Tough leaving family during expeditions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Shawn%20McAvinue" target="_blank">Shawn McAvinue</a></address>
      <p>A Dunedin naval lieutenant is on a ship floating off a subantarctic island and misses his baby daughter, but the separation is made easier by other sailors aboard ‘‘being in the same boat’’.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Brett Fitzgerald, who was born and raised in Dunedin, was on HMNZS Canterbury, which departed the T/U sheds in central Dunedin on Friday last week.</p>
      <p>The 131m-long ship arrived at the Auckland Islands the following Sunday morning and sailed to Campbell Island that evening.</p>
      <p>The ship has been floating off Campbell Island since Monday morning.</p>
      <p>He spent about half of the year on the ship, and it was ‘‘tough’’ leaving his wife and four-month-old daughter in Auckland.</p>
      <p>Many of the sailors on the ship had children and supported each other to help them cope being away from family.</p>
      <p>‘‘Everyone here is in the same boat, excuse the pun,’’ Lt Fitzgerald said.</p>
      <p>After a two-night stay in Dunedin to load supplies, the ship departed for the Subantarctic Islands on Operation Endurance with about 250 people on board.</p>
      <p>They were a mix of army, navy and air force personnel and staff from the Department of Conservation (Doc), MetService and the Defence Technology Agency.</p>
      <p>Lt Fitzgerald joined the navy about eight years ago, following study at Taieri College, gaining a business degree at University of Otago and teaching English in Asia.</p>
      <p>On the ship, he works in the support department, a logistics role which involves managing equipment and finance.</p>
      <p>The attraction of the Navy was the opportunity to go on expeditions, he said.</p>
      <p>‘‘I’ve been to Antarctica, Samoa, the border between North and South Korea and all around New Zealand.’’</p>
      <p>He had passed the Subantarctic Islands on a trip to the Antarctic before, but had never gone ashore, something he was hoping to do on this trip.</p>
      <p>Lt Fitzgerald planned to return to Dunedin to celebrate Christmas with his family and would return on the ship for the same operation in late March next year.</p>
      <p>The ship’s commanding officer, Commander Martin Walker, said the ‘‘exciting’’ operation includes a day at the Auckland Islands and about two weeks at Campbell Island.</p>
      <p>The Doc staff were taking dogs to investigate if any pests were on the islands, which could threaten its world heritage site designation.</p>
      <p>The MetService staff would be taken to the islands to check the monitoring stations which help MetService forecast storms coming from the Southern Ocean and Antarctic.</p>
      <p>On the expedition, Defence Technology Agency staff would replace a wave buoy —equipment to measure waves — in the Southern Ocean.</p>
      <p>The largest wave the current buoy in the Southern Ocean had measured was 23m high, he said.</p>
      <p>For the first time, an Air Force NH90 helicopter was being taken on the ship to fly people and supplies to the islands.</p>
      <p>The ship was one of the hardest-working in the navy fleet, he said.</p>
      <p> ‘‘We spend a lot of time moving things and people around.</p>
      <p>‘‘That’s what we are designed to do and we love doing it.’’</p>
