      <h1>Powell ton not enough to save Scorpions, Leewards claims semi-final spot</h1>

      <p>Jamaica middle-order batsman Rovman Powell slammed a brutal 106 in just 40 balls but could not prevent a 13-runs loss to the Leeward Islands, who booked a spot in the semi-finals of the Colonial Medical Insurance Super50 Cup, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Scorpions were set 256 to win, on the back of a patient 105 from Kieran Powell, but crucially needed to achieve the target inside 31 overs to overhaul their opponents’ NRR.  The Scorpions found their runs chase way off target after finding themselves at 25 for three in the fifth over, after losing top order batsmen Assad Fudadin, Aldane Thomas and Nkrumah Bonner.</p>
      <p>Powell, however, kept the Scorpions in touch with an explosive display of batting, reaching his second hundred of the tournament from 38 balls with two runs into the leg-side off Quinton Boatswain.  Jamaica’s chances went up in smoke, however, when Powell was caught behind off Boatswain in the same over he got to the third hundred of his Super50 Cup career.</p>
      <p>Boatswain was the pick of the Leewards bowlers after claiming figures of 4 for 85.</p>
      <p>In their turn at the crease, the Leewards were in early trouble after losing opener Montcin Hodge for 10, with 27 on the board.  Amir Jangoo joined Powell at the crease, however, and pair put on a match-winning 154 for the second wicket.</p>
      <p>The Hurricanes will play hosts Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Force in the second semi-final on Friday at the Queen’s Park Oval in the Trinidad capital of Port of Spain, where the first semi-final, a day earlier, will feature Group A winners Barbados Pride and either Guyana Jaguars or West Indies Emerging Players, one of which will be the runners-up in Group B.</p>
