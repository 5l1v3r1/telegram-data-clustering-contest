      <p>A fugitive from justice and self-acclaimed leader of Western Togoland, has told government he is still in the country.</p>
      <p>In a broadcast message on youtube, Charles Komi Kudzordzi said: “I am in the country anyway, I have not travelled or hidden anywhere, but I want the government to show maturity, invite me legally through my lawyers and I will present myself for the case to continue.”</p>
      <p>The octogenarian also condemned the arrest of some of his followers by the government when he said “I want to tell the government of Ghana that what has started happening is not the right thing; going round, arresting people in the streets, taking them and locking them up in cells and particularly taking my near 70year old wife and locking her up, no, that is not the right thing.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ho District Court ordered the arrest of the leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF), Charles Kwame Kudzodzi and two others over their unlawful declaration of parts of the Volta Region as a sovereign state.</p>
      <p>This was after five other members of the group were put before court for taking part in the activity, AdomNews Mubarak Yakubu has reported.</p>
      <p>The five have been charged with treason and have been remanded into prison custody until December 4, after the prosecution told the court that they would be needed to assist with investigations.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the police in the Region, Corporal Prince Dogbatse has called for calm among residents of the region and maintained that the Volta Region remains a part of Ghana.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Government’s response</b>
      </p>
      <p>The government has served notice to deal according to law with members of the secessionist group, that declared parts of the Volta region independent of Ghana.</p>
      <p>A government statement signed by Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah said, “Ghana remains a sovereign state which has not ceded any part of its territory to any person or group of persons.</p>
      <p>“While admonishing the public to disregard the claims by the group, the general public is hereby informed that state security agencies are taking the necessary measures to ensure that persons involved with the illegal act, are dealt with in accordance with the law,” Mr. Oppong Nkrumah said.</p>
