      <h1>Elections In Hong Kong: Record Participation After Months Of Protest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Olawale Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>A record number of Hong Kongers rallied Sunday for the local elections, the pro-democracy movement intending to use the ballot boxes to increase pressure on the authorities of the former British colony, theatre since June of unprecedented protest.</p>
      <p>The participation has exceeded 70%, announced the Electoral Commission, a record rate well above the 47% of the previous election of 2015, and a mobilization that should benefit the pro-democracy camp.</p>
      <p>Throughout the semi-autonomous region, long queues had formed very early around polling stations.</p>
      <p>Normally, these elections to choose the 452 members of 18 district councils who are competent in matters of everyday life such as garbage collection do not raise enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>But the time is no longer normal in a territory that is experiencing its most serious political crisis since returning to the fold of Beijing in 1997, with demonstrations and actions increasingly violent to demand including democratic reforms.</p>
