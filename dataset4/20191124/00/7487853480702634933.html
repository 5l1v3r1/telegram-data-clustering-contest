      <h1>Jadon Sancho Feels 'Humiliated' by Borussia Dortmund as Huge Clubs Prepare to Offer Escape Route</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14401747" target="_blank">Tom Gott</a></address>
      <p>​Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho feels humiliated and scapegoated by the Bundesliga side, as many European giants prepare to offer him a way out of Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Sancho was publicly blasted by club officials after returning late from international duty back in October, before manager Lucien Favre opted to withdraw Sancho in the first half of the 4-0 loss to Bayern Munich because he felt the winger was not good enough.</p>

      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/?source=twitteruk">​The Athletic</a> claim that these experiences have left Sancho feeling unprotected by <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/dortmund">​Dortmund</a>, and he fears that his club have been focused on their own image, even if it means punishing Sancho to protect it.</p>
      <p>Club officials have constantly questioned Sancho about his future, despite his representatives insisting that they had no desire to push for a move this season. The teenager is said to be both confused and upset by Dortmund's persistent enquiries and questionable handling of the situation.</p>
      <p>With Dortmund struggling on the pitch this season - they currently sit sixth in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/bundesliga">​Bundesliga</a> - Sancho believes that he is being used as the scapegoat for the club's problems since the start of the campaign.</p>

      <p>His representatives are set to discuss Sancho's situation with the club in the near future, and they are aware that there would be no shortage of suitors if they did decide to pursue a move elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The Athletic state that <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a>, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a> are the only sides who are actively pursuing a deal. Former side <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a> have only asked to be kept informed about any bids, while there is said to have been no contact with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a>.</p>

      <p>Sancho is yet to make a decision about his future. He does not want to entertain offers at the minute and is simply focused on rediscovering his best form in Germany. The England international is known to be careful decision-maker, and he will not make a move until he is completely certain that what he is doing is best for his career.</p>
      <p>Something has certainly seemed off for Sancho at Dortmund this season. It appears as though things have taken a turn for the worse, and there will be plenty of teams ready to take advantage of all the uncertainty.</p>
