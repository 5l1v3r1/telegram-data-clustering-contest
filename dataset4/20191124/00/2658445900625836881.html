      <p>Who says only weekends are meant for ‘owanbes’? The remembrance ceremony of Oba Yekini Elegushi was not held on Friday or Saturday, yet it was star-studded.</p>
      <p>Kudos should be given to Olori Sekina, the first wife of Oba Saheed Elegushi, for ensuring that everyone had a nice time. The party was divided into two parts. While a ceremony was held outside the palace for the community, there was another private party inside the palace for close friends of the king.  Guests were forced to eat more than a meal and the drinks refused to finish.</p>
      <p>Despite the enormous task before her, the Olori didn’t look overwhelmed and she still had the time to party with guests and exchange greetings.</p>
      <p>Elegushi’s new wife, Queen Hadiza, was also at the party. Even though many guests wanted to get a close look at her, she was less active. It was later leant that the event made it the first time she would step into the palace. This could better explain why she stayed calm, allowing Sekinat to run the show.</p>
