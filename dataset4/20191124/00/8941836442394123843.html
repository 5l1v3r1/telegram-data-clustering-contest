      <p>CHICAGO (AP) - Khalil Mack set up a touchdown with a strip-sack, Allen Robinson had a season-high 131 yards receiving and the Chicago Bears beat the struggling New York Giants 19-14 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Trying to salvage something from a disappointing season, the Bears (5-6) bounced back from a loss to the Los Angeles Rams to win for the second time in three games. The Giants (2-9) dropped their seventh straight and clinched their third losing season in a row.</p>
      <p>Mack broke through in the third quarter for just his second sack in seven games. Held without a tackle at Los Angeles, the three-time All-Pro nailed Jones deep in New York territory, and Chicago’s Nick Williams recovered at the 3. That led to a 2-yard touchdown run by quarterback Mitchell Trubisky to make it 19-7.</p>
      <p>New York cut the lead to five with 4:10 left in the game when Golden Tate hauled in a 23-yard pass on fourth-and-18. The Bears then went three-and-out before Pat O’Donnell pinned the Giants at the 6 with a 61-yard punt, and Chicago hung on from there.</p>
      <p>Trubisky threw for a season-high 278 yards, including a touchdown to Robinson, and two interceptions after missing the final drive the previous week because of a right hip pointer. Robinson had six catches, and the defending NFC North champions gave their frustrated fans something to cheer.</p>

      <p>Jones was 21 of 36 for 150 yards and two touchdowns. Saquon Barkley ran for 59 yards after rushing for 72, 64, 28 and 1 in his first four games back from a high right ankle sprain.</p>
      <p>Aldrick Rosas missed two field goals, and New York fell to 7-20 in two seasons under coach Pat Shurmur.</p>
      <p>The Bears took a 10-7 lead early in the third when Trubisky hit Robinson down the middle for a 32-yard TD after New York’s Janoris Jenkins got flagged for holding on third down to keep the drive going.</p>
      <p>Robinson also caught a 49-yard strike with Chicago deep in its territory to help set up a 24-yard field goal by Eddy Piñeiro midway through the third, making it 13-7.</p>

        <p>Mack then nailed Jones from behind for a strip-sack that Nick Williams recovered at the New York 3, and Trubisky plowed in to make it 19-7. A 2-point conversion pass to Taylor Gabriel got wiped out by a penalty against Robinson away from the ball. Another penalty by Chicago as Piñeiro missed an extra point led to a 48-yard attempt by him that failed.</p>
