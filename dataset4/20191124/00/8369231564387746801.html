      <p>Egypt on Saturday unveiled a cache of 75 wooden and bronze statues and five lion cub mummies decorated with hieroglyphics at the Saqqara necropolis near the Giza pyramids in Cairo.</p>
      <p>Mummified cats, cobras and crocodiles and scarabs were also unearthed among the well-preserved mummies and other objects discovered recently.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/moantiquities/posts/2666207426758224">The Antiquities Ministry</a> announced the find at the foot of the Bastet Temple, dedicated to the worship of cats among ancient Egyptians, in the vast necropolis.</p>
      <p>Antiquities Minister Khaled El-Enany described the discovery as "a (whole) museum by itself".</p>
      <p>He said initial archaeological studies showed that five of the mummies are lion cubs.</p>
      <p>Other artifacts uncovered in the dig included statues of an Apis bull, a mongoose, an ibis, a falcon and the ancient Egyptian god Anubis in animal form.</p>

      <p>The artifacts belong to the 26th Dynasty which dates back to the seventh century BCE, Enany said.</p>
      <p>The trove also boasts a collection of ancient Egyptian deities in the form of 73 bronze statuettes depicting the god Osiris, six wooden statues of Ptah-Soker and 11 statues of Sekhmet, the warrior goddess of healing.</p>
      <p>Egypt has sought to promote its unique heritage as a way to revive its vital tourism sector, which has been badly hit by political insecurity and attacks.</p>
      <p>However, critics say archaeological sites and museums suffer from negligence and poor management.</p>
