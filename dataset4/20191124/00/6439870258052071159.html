      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Victor Tucker scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and Charlotte is bowl eligible for the first time with its 24-13 victory over Marshall on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 49ers (6-5, 4-3 Conference USA) have won four straight conference games for their program-best sixth win.</p>
      <p>Tucker ran into the end zone from the 5 on a jet sweep to give Charlotte a 17-13 lead with 10:47 to play. Charlotte’s Nafees Lyon intercepted an Isaiah Green pass with about seven minutes left. Chris Reynolds then led the 49ers on an 11-play, 62-yard drive capped by his 25-yard TD pass to Tucker with 48 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Tucker had five catches for 121 yards. Reynolds threw for 166 yards and two interceptions and added 145 yards on the ground, including a 15-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Benny LeMay added 100 yards rushing to surpass 3,000 in his career at Charlotte.</p>
