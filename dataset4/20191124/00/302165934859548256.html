      <p>MADRID, Nov 24 — Rafael Nadal led Spain to the Davis Cup final as he and Feliciano Lopez won a thrilling late-night doubles to seal a nail-biting 2-1 victory over Britain yesterday.</p>
      <p>Kyle Edmund gave Britain the lead with an emphatic win over the 38-year-old Lopez before Nadal levelled things up with an equally dominant display against Dan Evans.</p>
      <p>For the second time in the day a semi-final came down to the doubles rubber and it was the Spanish left-handers who clawed out a 7-6(3) 7-6(8) victory in a match of unremitting tension.</p>
      <p>Britain had four set points to take the match into a decider but world number one Nadal, playing like a man possessed, raised his game and dragged his country home.</p>
      <p>When Lopez’s first serve completed the job an explosion of noise threatened to take the roof off the Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>In their first Davis Cup final since 2012, Spain will face Canada who also won a cliffhanger earlier yesterday against Russia. Canada will be appearing in their first final.</p>
      <p>Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil, who have played every rubber for Canada this week, clinched victory in the deciding doubles against Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov.</p>
      <p>“I have no words, it’s unbelievable,” the 20-year-old Shapovalov said on court as Canada’s fans celebrated.</p>
      <p>Pospisil’s incredible run of singles wins here came to an end in the opener against Rublev, the Russian winning 6-4 6-4.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov levelled the tie when he beat Khachanov 6-4 4-6 6-4 before the Canadian duo edged the doubles 6-3 3-6 7-6(5).</p>
      <p>Both sets of players will now have to do it all again today as a manic and exhilarating week reaches its climax. — Reuters</p>
