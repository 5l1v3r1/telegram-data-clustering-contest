      <h1>Ford Mustang Mach-E Originally Looked Like This</h1>
      <h2>You know a new model is important when Ford makes a mini documentary about it.</h2>

      <p>Promotional videos advertising new model launches are nothing new. For the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e">Mustang Mach-E</a>, however, Ford has gone the extra mile and released a mini-documentary video emphasizing the importance of the Blue Oval automaker's first-ever fully electric SUV.</p>
      <p>Titled "Making the Mustang Mach-E," the video is narrated by Ford team members and Mustang owners and provides a behind the scenes look at how Ford's first electric SUV was created. If you have 20 minutes to spare, it's well worth a watch, as it covers the design process and the initial controversy surrounding the electric <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">Mustang</a>-inspired SUV.</p>

      <p>Originally, Ford's all-electric <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ford-s-mustang-inspired-electric-suv-won-t-be-called-the-mach-1">SUV wasn't going to be called the Mustang</a> and was instead designed to be a technology showcase. "The team was trying to show to the customers that we have this incredible technical capability," Ted Cannis, global director of electrification, explained. "It was going to be a great battery-electric vehicle, but it wasn't going to be an emotional heartbeat. It was just a car."</p>
      <p>It was also going to look radically different to the SUV <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/introducing-the-2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-an-icon-goes-electric">shown at the 2019 LA Auto Show</a>. Early prototype designs are shown in the documentary, which Jim Farley, Ford's president of new business and technology, described as looking like "a science project." The direction changed when Jim Hackett took over as the company's president and CEO in May 2017 and created a dedicated electric vehicle team called Ford Team Edison, which ultimately persuaded Bill Ford to use the Mustang name.</p>

      <p>Ford clearly didn't take this decision lightly, as the Mustang name has certain expectations attached to it. Every decision was scrutinized, from the styling and interior to using the iconic pony badge.</p>
      <p>The performance also had to live up to the Mustang name. As we discovered, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/8-things-we-learned-riding-in-the-2021-ford-mustang-mach-e">Mustang Mach-E doesn't disappoint</a> in this area. When it goes on sale next year, the Mustang Mach-E will be available in several flavors, including rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants complete with standard- and long-range battery configurations.</p>
      <p>With AWD, the standard Mach-E has 332 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, enabling the electric SUV to do 0-62 mph in around 5.5 seconds, while the range-topping GT model increases the output to around 459 hp and reduces the 0-62 mph time to around 3.5 seconds.</p>
