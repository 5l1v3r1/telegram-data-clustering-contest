      <h1>Day 2 of FiveSixZero took the discussion beyond Bengaluru and dabbled in India’s music scene</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p><i>By Bidushi Das<br/><br/><b>Stalwarts weigh in on the music scene</b></i> <br/><br/>While Day 1 of FiveSixZero saw discussions about the music scene in the city, Day 2 made the talks country-wide with artists, producers, content creators, and industry stalwarts discussing issues like the journey of an artist, how a brand integrates music to reach the masses, and the underground music scene. The summit, which wound up on Saturday, is an initiative of Times Red Cell, is curated by Nocturnal Networks , and is held in association with Bangalore Mirror. <br/><br/>The keynote address was delivered by Ashish Pherwani, media and entertainment partner at Ernst &amp; Young. He predicted a phenomenal growth of music festivals and concerts over the next five years. Calling himself a numbers guy, he presented to the audience statistics about how content is consumed in India and how it is changing drastically. Regional content and music, he said, is the way forward. <br/><br/>Pherwani returned to moderate the next session, along with Abhinav Dandona, South India sales director for Anheuser-Busch InBev, the company which makes Budweiser, Ankush Bahuguna, content creator at MensXP, and BrandMusiq founder Rajeev Raja. They spoke about how brands collaborate with artists and content creators . Speaking about digital content creation, Bahuguna said, “It is all about finding the right match, the right brand collaborating with the right influencer. I think that’s what working on the internet right now.” <br/><br/>An interesting session of the day, Starmakers Forum: Journey of an Artist, dealt with the very important aspect of mental health and how an artist and their creativity is impacted by the demands of the profession. This session brought together Tej Brar of Third Culture Entertainment and manager to Nucleya, Vernon Ibrahim of True School of Music, Rajeev Rajagopal, Thermal &amp; A Quarter’s drummer, and electro-pop band Best Kept Secret’s lead vocalist Behram Siganporia. Moderated by artist manager Amol Raval, this session also steered the conversation towards the negativity of the show business and how an artist copes with it. Citing Nucleya’s example to highlight that it is better to prevent a mental health crisis rather than dealing with it when it arises, Brar spoke about the artist’s six-month hiatus every year that nurtures his creativity. He also spoke about how financial security is an aspect that might affect an artist’s creativity and mental health. He added, “Artists are worried about rent and their expenses. They’re unsure whether they’ll be able to maintain their lifestyle or afford the life they aspire to lead. As a manager, if you can go and take that stress off their mind, I think it goes a long way.” The session also discussed what’s holding us back from having an Indian international artist, when international artists are performing in the country every other weekend. <br/><br/>India’s underground music scene was the topic of discussion for the next session that saw panelists such as UNMUTE’s Dev Bhatia, DJ Praveen Achary, and Bengaluru’s DJ school Beatworx’s cofounder Ashwin Baburao. The session was moderated by DJ Tasneem. The panel discussed about the growth of underground music and how its definition has changed over the years. <br/><br/>The penultimate session of the day was an all-woman affair with ARMADA’s PR manager Justine Servais, being joined by popular singer and music producer Anushka Manchanda and moderator Aneesha Kotwani, India’s community manager for SheSaid.So, which is an international community for women in music. This session discussed the struggles of a woman in the music industry and what changes have taken place in the global music scene with respect to female artists. Servais rued that even though there are several great female EDM artists in the world, very few are as famous as their male counterparts. <br/><br/>Music production was the final topic of the day and saw Anushka Manchanda, Qilla Records’ Sahil Bhatt, Jurrien Romejin from ARMADA and Stephen Dowler from Monstercat discussing about how an artist, looking to make it big, can get signed by major record labels. Moderated by Korean EDM sensation Justin Oh, this was the most star-studded panel.</p>
