      <h1>Jose Mourinho wants Nathan Ake at Tottenham Hotspur?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> are reportedly considering a swoop for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bournemouth/"><b>Bournemouth</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nathan-ake/"><b>Nathan Ake</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Spurs are expected to be in the market for at least one new centre-back in January or next summer as both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jan-vertonghen/"><b>Jan Vertonghen</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toby-alderweireld/"><b>Toby Alderweireld</b></a> will see their contracts expire at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Football Insider</i>, Tottenham are weighing up a move for Ake, who appeals to the club and new head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> due to his ability to play as a left-sided centre-back or a left-back.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old joined Bournemouth on a permanent deal in the summer of 2017 and has made 104 appearances for the Cherries in all competitions, contributing 10 goals in the process.</p>
      <p>Ake will see his current deal expire at the end of the 2021-22 campaign, though, and it is unclear whether <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eddie-howe/"><b>Eddie Howe</b></a>'s side have any immediate plans to open talks over a fresh contract.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands international has also <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/transfer-talk/news/man-city-to-sign-ake-in-gbp40m-deal_363639.html">previously been linked</a> with a move to Manchester City.</p>
