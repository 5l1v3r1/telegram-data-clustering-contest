      <p><b>Wine</b>: Morio Muscat and Friends, 2018</p>
      <p><b>Winery:</b> Wild Goose, Okanagan Falls</p>
      <p><b>Why drink it?</b> Morio Muscat is an interesting grape, a cross between Silvaner from Germany and Pinot Blanc, and the friendly addition here is Muscat Ottonel, notable for its slightly sweet characteristics. That all said, if you like your white wines dry, this may not be for you. But if you’re willing to branch out, the nose on this is full of orange blossoms and citrus groves with nutmeg and clove hints. Highly aromatic, a sip is more balanced than you might expect, with grapefruit and candied lemon peel with a satisfying and refreshing finish.</p>
      <p><b>Price</b>: $20</p>
      <p><b>Pair with:</b> Potato and sweet corn chowder, and pour a bit of this wine in the pot and let it simmer a bit. Savory corn bread muffins at brunch on the side of a frittata, or banana bread. Or simply keep a bottle chilled to enjoy with friends and a variety of potato chip flavours.</p>
      <p><b>Music pairing:</b> I’ll Be There For You, The Rembrandts</p>
