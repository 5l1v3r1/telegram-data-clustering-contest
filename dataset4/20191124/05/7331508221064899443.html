      <p>No. 6 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2483/oregon-ducks">Oregon</a> had a brief stay in our football writers' weekly votes for the teams that should be in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/rankings">College Football Playoff</a> right now.</p>
      <p>The Ducks were upset by Arizona State on Saturday, 31-28, coming up short in a wild second-half comeback.</p>
      <p>They had received votes from four of our writers last week.</p>

      <p>No. 2 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State</a> held off No. 8 Penn State 28-17, with the Nittany Lions scoring all their points in the third quarter.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4241985/jk-dobbins">J.K. Dobbins</a> rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns, and <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields">Justin Fields</a> threw for 188 yards and two scores for the Buckeyes.</p>
