      <h1>Free Amid Evil DLC shows how the retro shooter used to look</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:04:07+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jody-macgregor/" target="_blank">Jody Macgregor</a></address>
      <p>Amid Evil is one of the best of the recent crop of retro shooters, with its pseudo-Heretic style and a magic staff that shoots planets. It came a long way over the course of its development, and now you can experience that journey with a free expansion called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1198780/AMID_EVIL__Ancient_Alphas/">Ancient Alphas</a>.</p>
      <p>The Ancient Alphas DLC lets you play through areas that didn't make it into the finished game, try a very different version of the room-clearing Aeturnum BFG, explore alternate visions of some levels, and experience the full journey Amid Evil took to its final release.</p>
      <p>Amid Evil's journey isn't over, however. Developers Indefatigable shared a single screenshot of how their game will look with ray-tracing enabled, and like Minecraft before it the difference is actually noteworthy. As for when we'll be able to play Amid Evil in RTX, all they're saying is "SOON".</p>
