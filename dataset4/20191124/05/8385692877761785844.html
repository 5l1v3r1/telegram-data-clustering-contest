      <p>Today, you can <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">save big</a> on both the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. With the Pixel 3 coming in at $349 and the Pixel 3 XL coming in at $399. This is actually lower than these are supposed to be on Black Friday. Making this a really great time to pick up a new Pixel 3.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3 and 3 XL were released last year by Google. These aren't the latest and greatest any longer, but still worth picking up. Since these were released as flagship smartphones, they do still stand tall with the other smartphones on the market today.</p>
      <p>These sport a Snapdragon 845 chipset, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The smaller Pixel 3 has a 5.5-inch display with a 1080p resolution, while the Pixel 3 XL has a 6.3-inch Quad HD+ display. The other major difference is the battery size, where the Pixel 3 has a 2915mAh battery and the Pixel 3 XL sports a larger 3730mAh battery pack.</p>

      <p>Both of these smartphones are still getting updates, and will for at least another year. Google promises two years of updates, but if the original Pixel is anything to go by, it will likely get it for a bit longer than that.</p>
      <p>But more importantly, it is getting camera updates still. Which includes the improved Night Sight and Astrophotography modes that came with the Pixel 4 just a couple months ago. That makes this a really great smartphone to pick up. Seeing as it does still have the best smartphone camera on the market. And it's not even a close race right now.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are both unlocked. These can be used on all four US carriers. That includes AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.</p>
