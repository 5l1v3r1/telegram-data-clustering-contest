      <p>Delegates attending the Golden Jubilee edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) and locals from Goa are experiencing the evolution of Indian cinema and the country’s premier film festival through a number of hi-tech installations erected at an informative exhibition organised on the sidelines of the festival.</p>
      <p>The event has been organised by National Film Archive of India (NFAI) and Bureau of Outreach (BoU) at Kala Academy in Panjim. The festival titled ‘IFFI@50’ uses interactive digital technology to inform and engage visitors about the history of cinema in the world — starting from its birth in France — and in India, and its journey so far. The festival pays special attention to the history of IFFI, starting from 1952 when the festival commenced and until the current edition, through various milestones in between.</p>
      <p>The festival is attracting school students in large numbers, apart from film delegates attending IFFI. It was inaugurated by Amit Khare, secretary, Information and Broadcasting (I&amp;B) Ministry, on Thursday. “The exhibition is a tribute to Indian cinema and the journey of IFFI from its inception. Since it uses modern digital technology and is interactive, it has become engaging for the visitors and we are receiving positive feedback from them. Many of the school children visiting the exhibitions are experiencing their first brush with film history and are getting initiated in film scholarship,” said Arti Karkhanis, a senior NFAI office-bearer.</p>
      <p>The exhibition uses several first-of-its-kind hi-tech features such as Zoetrope (a moving picture creative installation), augmented reality experience, vertical digital display panels, virtual reality tools and display of IFFI’s journey through the last 49 editions via digital panels. These have been designed to engage the audience to showcase the craft of filmmaking and highlight the impact of cinema on society.</p>
      <p>While inaugurating the festival, I&amp;B Secretary Khare said the exhibition will benefit the old and young alike as it makes it easier for them to understand the subject of Indian film history and the journey of IFFI.</p>
      <p>The installations include ‘The Arrival of Cinema’, ‘Birth of Indian Cinema’, ‘IFFI: A Pictorial History’, ‘IFFI in Press’,<br/>‘Down the Memory Lane of National Film Awards’ ‘Augmented Reality’, ‘Fans and Critics’, ‘Konkani Cinema’ and ‘Mahatma on Celluloid’, among others.</p>
      <p>“Various new techniques have been employed in the exhibition. The information can be heard by plugging in the headphones and accessed through touch,” said Khare.</p>
