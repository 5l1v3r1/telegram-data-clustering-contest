      <p>DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates, which sent its first astronaut into space this year and has plans to launch a probe to Mars, is looking at other new frontiers — space tourism and mining.<br/>But first, says the chief of the Emirates Space Agency, there needs to be regulation.<br/>Within a few months the UAE will enact its first space law, he said, designed to attract investment and regulate the activities and services of companies operating in the country.<br/>“It was approved by the government and now is in its final stage of issuing,” the space agency’s director general Mohammed Al-Ahbabi said.<br/>The UAE, whose colossal skyscrapers and mega-projects put it on the world map, hopes otherworldly new industries could be the key to its economic future.<br/>The country already has the most diverse economy in the oil-reliant Gulf, but the once-booming property, tourism and trade sectors that have made it a regional powerhouse have sagged in recent years.<br/>So now it is looking beyond Earth itself, with typically grand ambitions for a country whose cities rise out of the desert.<br/>The new law, drafted by the agency, would address future space tourism or mining projects.<br/>“We think it’s going to come to (fruition) within the next 10 years,” Ahbabi said of the sector.<br/>“There is no project today because the technology is not yet there, but we’re looking ahead of time and putting together those regulations.”<br/>In March, the space agency signed a memorandum of understanding with Richard Branson’s space tourism company Virgin Galactic for cooperation on various plans, including potential tourism flights.<br/>“We look forward to working with the UAE Space Agency and other partners in the UAE,” Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said at the time.<br/>The new law will also regulate UAE-developed satellites to make sure they adhere to international space treaties.<br/>“This is a legal document to regulate the space industry ... for example registering your satellite and making sure you have the proper licensing,” Abhabi said.<br/>Ahbabi said the UAE has 10 functioning satellites in orbit and plans to launch another eight in the next few years.<br/>The existing satellites, he said, were under the jurisdiction of other government entities, including the telecommunications authority and the finance ministry.<br/>“But now we’re transferring all the data to the space agency,” he said.<br/>The UAE launched its national space strategy earlier this year, setting out a framework for its activities in the sector over the next decade.<br/>In September it celebrated the milestone of sending the first Emirati into space.<br/>Hazza Al-Mansouri was part of a three-member crew that blasted off on a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan.<br/>He returned home to a hero’s welcome after an eight-day mission in which he became the first Arab to visit the International Space Station, where he took part in scientific experiments including a time-perception study.<br/>In 2020, the UAE aims to become the first Arab country to launch an unmanned probe, named Hope, which will travel to Mars before returning to Earth the following year.<br/>The UAE is also planning to build a “Science City” to replicate conditions on Mars, where it hopes to build a human settlement by 2117.</p>
