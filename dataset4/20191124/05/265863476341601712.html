      <h1>Salma Hayek Shows Off Her Natural Beauty In Makeup-Free Video And She Looks Like She’s In Her 20s!</h1>

      <p>The 53 year old actress looks half her age and as stunning as ever in a new post in which she showed off her beautiful makeup-free face! Salma Hayek shared a clip with her followers where she was enjoying the sunset and literally glowing because of it but even more so because of her youthful and effortless looks.</p>
      <p>The actress was trying to shoot a video of her at the beach, with the setting sun behind her.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, she was dealing with something that always happens when people try to capture a sunset.</p>
      <p>Moving the camera even just a little can cause the beautiful colors in the sky to no longer be captured properly as they fade in the footage, not showing even nearly as vibrant.</p>
      <p>Regardless, as she tried over and over again to film the sunset properly with her face in the frame, people ended up focusing way more on her natural beauty than the sunset, which kept fading.</p>
      <p>In the post’s caption, she even made a self-deprecating joke, only adding to her charm.</p>
      <p>‘There was a beautiful sunset but every time my face came into frame it scared the colors away,’ she wrote.</p>

      <p>In the video, she was talking about the same thing but in Spanish, explaining to her followers that the sunset was absolutely stunning but every time her face came into frame, the colors became ‘cr*p.’</p>
      <p>Either way, her fans appreciated the post anyway, commenting things like: ‘Yea. It appears your luminosity outshines the sun. 😁😂😅😊.’ / ‘The sunset was jealous of your beauty.’ / ‘I dont know what’s prettier, you or the sunset 🙌🌅/’ / ‘or your beauty stolen the colors?😊.’ / ‘It knew it couldn’t compete… :).’ So sweet!</p>
