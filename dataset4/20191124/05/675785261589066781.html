      <h2>Ellie Gould, 17, wrote in an A-level assignment asking for proper punishment for kids who kill weeks before her teen ex-boyfriend Thomas Griffths stabbed her to death</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:13:44+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:13</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Lo</a></address>
      <p>A schoolgirl wrote an essay calling for tougher penalties for children who kill - just weeks before she was stabbed to death by her 17-year-old boyfriend.</p>
      <p>Ellie Gould, 17, was murdered at her parent's home the day after she broke up with "obsessed" Thomas Griffiths in May.</p>
      <p>In an A-level assignment just weeks earlier, Ellie mentioned the murder of two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.</p>
      <p>She wrote about how the families of such victims deserved justice and demanded proper punishment for children who kill.</p>
      <p>Just weeks later she was stabbed to death in a jealous rage by Griffiths, who placed the knife in her dead hand to try to make the murder look like a suicide.</p>
      <p>Griffiths, 17, was sentenced handed a life sentence and must serve a minimum of 12 years and six months.</p>
      <p>Ellie's mum Carole, of Calne, Wiltshire, said: "Ellie thought sentences for child killers should bring justice for victims' families so that's what we're fighting for.</p>

      <p>"Ellie would be screaming at me to get her the justice she deserves."</p>
      <p>She said she will 'never forgive Griffiths'.</p>
      <p>"It was shocking that he was capable of such violence," she told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10410361/murdered-ellie-gould-tougher-laws-young-killers/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>Griffiths will be eligible to apply for a sentence reduction after half the time imposed.</p>
      <p>Due to his age, the serving terms can be shortened if 'the offender's welfare may be seriously prejudiced by his continued imprisonment'.</p>
      <p>Ellie's family say he should serve at least 17 years, equivalent to Ellie's age, but a court decision on any review will be made on December 6.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the BBC, Mrs Gould said she wanted to see Griffiths spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
      <p>"He's a danger to society, particularly to women," she said.</p>
      <p>"He became obsessed with Ellie within a matter of weeks. He could become obsessed with another woman and who knows what could happen?"</p>
