      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanjay Raut has said BJP sought votes promising to jail Ajit Pawar</li>
        <li>The Sena MP asked will Fadnavis now put Ajit Pawar in jail and meet him at Arthur Road Jail</li>
        <li>Sanjay Raut also said BJP thought Ajit Pawar would bring all NCP MLAs, but that's far from truth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bitter with the great betrayal by NCP leader Ajit Pawar and former allies BJP on Saturday, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut asked what happened to BJP's poll promise of putting the NCP leader in jail over corruption charges.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Aaj Tak, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, "These people (BJP) sought votes in Maharashtra saying when they come back in power they will put Ajit Pawar behind the bars. Now that he is the deputy chief minister, will he start his office at Arthur Road Jail and will Fadnavis go there to run the government."</p>

      <p>Sanjay Raut added, "They (BJP) thought Ajit Pawar is such a big leader that he will bring the entire NCP along with him but that is far from the truth."</p>
      <p>"Some 10-12 NCP MLAs went with Ajit Pawar to the swearing-in on Saturday morning and nine of them have come back. Ajit Pawar may now have the support of 4-5 MLAs at the most," Sanjay Raut told Aaj Tak, sounding confident about the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance having enough support to prove majority in the Maharashtra assembly.</p>
      <p>NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said on Sunday morning that the party has the support of 50 of its MLAs. NCP had won 54 seats in the elections. Three MLAs are not communicating with the party while a fourth one is missing.</p>
      <p>"Now they (BJP) will use misuse all the resources they have such as money, power but we have the numbers in our favour. Devendra Fadnavis, Amit Shah and even the governor knows this very well," Sanjay Raut told Aaj Tak in the interview.</p>
      <p>He then went on to slam the quiet and surprise swearing-in ceremony of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar on Saturday morning that sprung a surprise on everyone.</p>
      <p>"The Maharashtra chief minister always takes oath in big events like the last time at the Wankhede Stadium or Shivaji Park. Why was it done in such a sneaky way this time. This is an accidental chief minister. This has never happened in Maharashtra," Raut said.</p>
      <p>"Fadnavis's government is in the ICU and they do not have the required support," he added.</p>
      <p>With 105 MLAs, BJP is the single largest party in the Maharashtra assembly. But it needs the support of 145 MLAs in the 288-member assembly to form the government. It is not clear how many NCP MLAs have pledged their support to the BJP while NCP says they have 50 MLAs with them along with 56 of Shiv Sena and Congress's 44 MLAs.</p>
