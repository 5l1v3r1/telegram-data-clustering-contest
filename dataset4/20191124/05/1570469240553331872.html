      <p>Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong urged people to vote on Sunday (November 24) to show the city's discontent to Beijing.</p>
      <p>Wong, a leader of those protests when just 17, was disqualified from running in Sunday's elections because of his links to a political group promoting independence for Hong Kong, a red line for Communist Party rulers in Beijing.</p>
      <p>Wong said he was the only person disqualified out of more than 1,100 candidates in the district council elections.</p>
      <p>Many Hong Kong people see the polls as a "referendum" on support for the anti-government protest movement, coming as the city grapples with its biggest political crisis in decades.</p>
      <p>As voting got underway at 7:30 a.m. (2330 GMT on Saturday), Reuters witnesses said there was only a small police presence, in contrast to earlier reports that riot police planned to guard all polling stations and almost all officers in the 31,000 strong force would be on duty.</p>
