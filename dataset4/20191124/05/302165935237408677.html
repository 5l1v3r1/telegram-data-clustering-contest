      <h1>Anwar says Hadi’s claim of ‘back door’ govt raised in Pakatan council, but no leads so far</h1>

      <p>SHAH ALAM, Nov 24 — Pakatan Harapan (PH) top leaders have discussed a claim by PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang to being offered a deal to form a “back door” government, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim disclosed today.</p>
      <p>However, the PKR president said the ruling coalition was not able to verify the authenticity of the Opposition politician’s claim to date.</p>
      <p>“We discussed this yesterday, but we do not know. I have not heard about Hadi except for today so we did not raise it today,” Anwar told reporters here, referring to the PH presidential council.</p>
      <p>The Port Dickson MP and backbencher reaffirmed PKR’s commitment to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s leadership, adding that PH does not entertain back door deals.</p>
      <p>Hadi told a gathering of PAS and Umno supporters at the launch of their Selangor Muafakat Nasional here last night that his party received an offer to form a new government through the “back door”, but rejected it.</p>
      <p>He did not disclose the identities of those purportedly behind the offer, saying the PAS-Umno alliance will take federal power only through legitimate means.</p>
      <p>Rumours of an ouster plot against Dr Mahathir resurfaced after PH’s defeat in the November 16 Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>Clamours blaming Dr Mahathir for the parliamentary seat loss and demands for the PM to take responsibility by handing over the reins to Anwar as promised have been gaining momentum.</p>
      <p>At the same time, rumours of a countermove by getting more Umno MPs to cross over to PH have also come up, fuelled by a late night meeting last week at the Putrajaya house of Anwar’s party deputy and Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali.</p>
      <p>Both Umno MPs who attended the meeting and Azmin have denied such moves.</p>
