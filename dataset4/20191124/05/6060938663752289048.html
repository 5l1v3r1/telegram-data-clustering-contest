      <p>BRISBANE: It was a rare failure for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Steve-Smith">Steve Smith</a> in the first Test against Pakistan as he could manage just four runs when all his teammates made the most of the batting-friendly conditions on offer at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/The-Gabba">The Gabba</a>.</p>
      <p>Smith, who has been in prolific form ever since his return to international cricket after serving a one-year ban for his involvement in the Sandpaper Gate fiasco, was bowled after facing just 10 deliveries by leg-spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yasir-Shah">Yasir Shah</a>.</p>

      <p>It was the seventh time in Tests that the Pakistan leg-spinner had Smith's number. After dismissing the prolific Australian batsman, the 33-year-old celebrated the wicket by putting both of his hands up as teammates embraced him.</p>
      <p>He gestured "seven" towards the dressing room and stands, making them know that it was the seventh time in Test cricket that he got the better of Smith.</p>
      <p>England's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Stuart-Broad">Stuart Broad</a> has dismissed Smith eight times in Test cricket but across 44 innings. Yasir is now only one behind him in the space of 11 innings.</p>
      <p>The leg-spinner had first announced himself to Smith and the Australians on debut in the UAE, picking up seven wickets in his first match and collecting 12 for the two-Test series there.</p>
