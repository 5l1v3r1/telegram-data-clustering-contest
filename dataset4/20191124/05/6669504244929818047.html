      <p>WINNIPEG - Coach Paul Maurice was thankful it was the Winnipeg Jets who capitalized on a mistake.</p>
      <p>Andrew Copp scored with 1:54 left in the third period to lift the Jets to a 4-3 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday. Columbus netminder Elvis Merzlikins tried to clear the puck up the middle of the ice and Copp knocked it down and scored.</p>
      <p>"I'm glad it was theirs. Really glad it was theirs," Maurice replied when asked what he was thinking when the goalie committed the turnover.</p>
      <p>Columbus coach John Tortorella wasn't in the mood to talk about the play. As he walked toward reporters for the post-game scrum, he told them not to ask him about the goal.</p>
      <p>"I'm warning you, I'll walk," Tortorella said.</p>
      <p>Copp also picked up an assist for the Jets (14-9-1), who are 4-1-0 in their past five games.</p>
      <p>"Luckily enough it kind of hit off a (defenceman) and slid in," Copp said of his fourth goal of the season."Kind of a fortuitous bounce, but with two minutes left you'll take them any way you can get them."</p>
      <p>Nikolaj Ehlers scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season for Winnipeg. Blake Wheeler had a goal and assist and Mathieu Perreault also scored.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Luc Dubois, Seth Jones and Gustav Nyquist each scored power-play goals as Columbus (9-9-4), saw its three-game win streak end. Oliver Bjorkstrand contributed a pair of assists.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg netminder Laurent Brossoit stopped 27 of the 30 shots he faced before he left the ice limping with 11:19 remaining in the third period. Connor Hellebuyck replaced him and made five saves.</p>
      <p>Merzlikins stopped 27 shots for the Blue Jackets, who are 3-1-1 in their last five games.</p>
      <p>The Jets lost defencemen Josh Morrissey (lower body) and Nathan Beaulieu (upper body) to injuries in the second period.</p>
      <p>Maurice said Brossoit had cramped up and wanted to go back in, but he stuck with Hellebuyck. Maurice also said Morrissey should be fine and Beaulieu needed some tests.</p>
      <p>Dubois said Copp's goal was tough to swallow, but Merzlikins didn't deserve all the blame.</p>
      <p>"You have to find a way to push and to push the pace to try to break them because they're playing with four defencemen," Dubois said.</p>
      <p>"So it'd be easy, but lazy, to say that we lost because of that mistake at the end because you have 60 minutes to win a game. It never comes down to just one minute or one mistake."</p>
      <p>Tortorella said his players tried hard.</p>
      <p>"We were the better team that found a way to lose," he said.</p>
      <p>The game was tied 1-1 after the first period and 3-3 after two.</p>
      <p>Dubois got the power-play scoring started at 4:59 of the first period with his 10th goal of the season, extending his point streak to four games with four goals and two assists in that span.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg responded with Wheeler firing in a one-timer past Merzlikins for his sixth goal of the season at 8:23.</p>
      <p>Ehlers came out of the penalty box for tripping early in the second period and promptly scored after a passing play with Wheeler to give the Jets a 2-1 lead at 5:19. It was Wheeler's 600th career point with the franchise.</p>
      <p>The lead was short lived as Jets defencemen Tucker Poolman and Luca Sbis were dinged with penalties nine seconds apart.</p>
      <p>Jones scored with the two-man advantage at 6:30 and Nyquist notched his goal 47 seconds later to swing the score 3-2 for Columbus.</p>
      <p>Blue Jackets defenceman Zach Werenski picked up an assist on Jones's goal, rolling his point streak to six games with three goals and five assists.</p>
      <p>Perreault tied it up with just over five minutes left in the second period.</p>
      <p>Morrissey left the game a minute after Nyquist's goal and Beaulieu departed with four minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Wheeler praised the four defencemen who had to play extra minutes.</p>
      <p>"They did an amazing job and, honestly, it didn't look like they were gasping for air, it didn't look like treading water," Wheeler said.</p>
      <p>The Jets were 0 for 3 on the power play and Columbus finished 3 for 5.</p>
      <p>After only one home game, Winnipeg heads out for a three-game road trip starting Wednesday in San Jose. Columbus returns home to host the Ottawa Senators on Monday.</p>
