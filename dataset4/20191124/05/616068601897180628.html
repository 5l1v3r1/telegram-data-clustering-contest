      <p>A cat whose owners both died last year was left alone and sick with no home, but she has defied the odds for her survival thanks to Critteraid Animal Sanctuary in Summerland. </p>
      <p>Saffron is a young cat with many medical issues who came to Critteraid malnourished and skinny. </p>
      <p>They were told Saffy might not last six months after her owners passed away. </p>
      <p>"Unfortunately for the family, there was no other option [than giving her up]," Critteraid animal director Jess Byer said, explaining that after her surrender, vets said her medical issues would be difficult to mitigate. </p>
      <p>But Saffy has defied the odds, and is now a poster-cat for the work Critteraid does. She is the unofficial secretary who greets every visitor to the Critteraid adoption centre. </p>
      <p>"Whenever you come into the lobby, she is the first to tell you if the cookies have not come down or if she needs more treats," Byer said.</p>
      <p>Vets who work with Critteraid say Saffy could see another year or two of life with proper care, despite her health issues. </p>
      <p>Byer says Saffy's case highlights the importance of community involvement in the Critteraid cause, because they could not afford to care for animals without help from the community. </p>
      <p>"Without the community's support and without the financial backing, we would not be able to provide such wonderful places," Byer said. </p>
