      <h3>Robert Pires believes that Arsenal need to sign more English players as the January transfer window draws nearer.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners have made a stuttering start to the new Premier League season and they currently find themselves outside of the top four in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are looking to try and break back into the top four after having finished fifth last season, but they have a lot of work to do following their poor and inconsistent form this term.</p>
      <p>With the January transfer window a matter of weeks away, attentions will inevitably turn towards the players that the Gunners could look to sign in the new year.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal midfielder Pires feels that the Gunners are in need of more English players because of the strong mentality they can bring to the team.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/robert-pires-tells-unai-emery-needs-sign-english-players-arsenal-11200632/">Metro</a>, Pires said: “We need English players because we are in England and nobody else has grown up with this mentality.</p>
      <p>“You need to be born here. It’s very nice when you get to discover new countries but for me when you play in England you need English players.</p>
      <p>“It’s a different time. But I used to play with David Seaman, Lee Dixon, Tony Adams, Martin Keown, Ashley Cole, Ray Parlour. We’re talking about six English players in the team. We need similar players.</p>
      <p>“Of course I respect the Arsenal philosophy but we are in the Premier League and it’s so tough every weekend.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal will return to Premier League action next weekend when the Gunners take on Norwich City away from home on Sunday 1 December.</p>
      <p>The Gunners will then take on Brighton and Hove Albion and West Ham United in their next two games in the Premier League as they look to keep their top-four hopes alive.</p>
