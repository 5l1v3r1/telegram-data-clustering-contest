      <p>WA Police has stressed it will “leave no stone unturned” in the investigation into the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Bentley.</p>
      <p>It is alleged two men with covered faces grabbed the young girl in a park on Mackay Street and sexually assaulted her between 6pm-11pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Today WA Police Minister Michelle Roberts said the incident was deeply concerning.</p>
      <p>“Everyone does need to be vigilant. Know where your children are and take all safety precautions,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Of course everyone should be able to walk the streets safely but unfortunately there are predators out there and my advice is take caution. Police will leave no stone unturned in this investigation, they're taking it very seriously.”</p>
      <p>Detectives from the Sex Crime Division as well as specialists are involved in the active investigation.</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent in Charge of the Major Crime Division Robert Anderson said he did not believe there was a “massive risk” to the public at this stage, adding the alleged incident appeared to be isolated.</p>
      <p>“Perth is an exceptionally safe place to live, yes of course there's always a risk to people,” he said.</p>
      <p>“As a parent I would urge all children, all parents to take care and due diligence around your surroundings, but is there a massive risk to the public at this stage? We're looking into that but at this stage I would say no.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers 131 444.</p>
