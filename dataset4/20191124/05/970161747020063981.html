      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> legend Tony Adams tore into <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> after the Gunners’ 2-2 draw against Southampton and says the side are paying the price for losing Laurent Koscielny and Aaron Ramsey.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexandre-lacazette/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> grabbed his second of the game in injury time to ensure Arsenal got a point from the Saints but there were chants of ‘Emery out’ at the full-time whistle.</p>
      <p>The draw means Arsenal have won just one of their last seven league matches and Emery admitted afterwards that he understands supporters’ frustrations.</p>
      <p>But that didn’t appease Adams, who says fans were right to boo his former club off the pitch.</p>

      <p>‘The boos are deserved. It was a terrible, terrible performance, very disjointed, no defending in sight, [Emery] changed his system three times – he’s not doing himself any favours,’ Adams told BT Sport.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t want any coach losing his job but the club’s not going forward, it’s not progressing. The recruitment has been really poor. We got rid of Koscielny – our best player – he had to go last year &amp; Ramsey, we lost. The team is evidently weaker because of it.</p>
      <p>‘I could put a team together that is more organised than that. There’s no one going out there to keep clean sheets, I can’t see a clean sheet in sight. When you’re giving the opposition team at the Emirates 20 chances on your goal, you’re never going to keep clean sheets’</p>
      <p>Earlier, Adams claimed Emery could lose his job due to Spurs’ decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Tottenham sacked the Argentine and replaced him with Jose Mourinho earlier this week.</p>
      <p>‘What’s happened over the other side of north London has put huge pressure on this guy, they’ve made a significant change,’ said Adams.</p>
