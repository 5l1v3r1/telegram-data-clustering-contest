      <p>The Gophers watched a two-goal lead evaporate in the third period before coming up empty in a shootout, settling for a 3-3 tie with Wisconsin on Saturday and conceding an extra point in the Big Ten standings.</p>
      <p>Minnesota won Friday’s series opener 4-1, their second win of the season in conference play.</p>
      <p>Ty Emberson got the Badgers on the board late at 18:31 of the first period, before Bryce Brodzinski scored the first goal of his college career with just a second remaining in the opening stanza.</p>
      <p>Blake McLaughlin scored on the power play at 4:22 of the second period, while Scott Reedy converted on a feed from Brannon McManus at 9:13 to make it 3-1 heading into the third.</p>
      <p>The Badgers wasted little time in the final frame.</p>
      <p>Tarek Baker rifled home a one-timer from the high slot just 18 seconds into the third, before K’Andre Miller scored on a blast from the blue line at 5:34 to tie the game.</p>
      <p>Badgers goaltender Jack Berry stood tall through two overtime periods, then turned aside Brannon McManus, Ben Meyers and Sampo Ranta in the shootout.</p>
      <p>Jack LaFontaine stopped star freshmen Alex Turcotte and Cole Caufield in the shootout, before Max Zimmer banked a shot in off the junior goalie to end it.</p>
      <p>Minnesota out-shot Wisconsin 38-36 and went 1-for-5 on the power play, while the Badgers went 0-for-4.</p>
      <p>The Gophers (5-6-3, 2-3-3 Big Ten) host nonconference rival North Dakota (10-1-2, 5-0-1 NCHC) Nov. 28-29.</p>
