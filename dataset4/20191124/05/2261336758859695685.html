      <h1>Video: Deontay Wilder viciously knocks Luis Ortiz out with vaunted right hand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:52:18+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:52</time> by <a rel="author">Mookie Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder (42-0-1, 41 KOs) was not wowing the fans with his rather inactive, tentative display against Luis Ortiz (31-2-2 NCs, 26 KOs) in their WBC heavyweight title rematch. This was largely a repeat of their first encounter last year, but in the same round where Ortiz had Wilder in the most significant trouble of his career, it was Wilder who reminded everyone that he has that great equalizer: Vicious KO power.</p>
      <p>With Ortiz able to tag Wilder in the 7th frame, it looked as if Ortiz was in position to win yet another round. Instead, Wilder uncorked a straight right hand that put Ortiz down and out. The Cuban did not beat the count and that was all she wrote. Ortiz fought well, but all it takes is one shot for Wilder to put you to sleep.</p>
      <p>Watch the video of this spectacular KO that not only led to Wilder defending his title, but also lined him up for his expected rematch with Tyson Fury next year.</p>
