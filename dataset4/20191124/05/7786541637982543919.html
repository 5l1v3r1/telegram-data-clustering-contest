      <p><b>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP)</b> - LSU coaches called one last play for running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire in hopes of getting him his fourth-straight 100-yard game.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it was only fitting that Edwards-Helaire, who needed just a yard, would break loose for a career-long 89-yard touchdown run. The top-ranked Tigers' new spread offense has been producing explosive plays all season - a big reason why they've booked a trip to the Southeastern Conference title game for the first time since 2011.</p>
      <p>Joe Burrow passed for 327 yards and three touchdowns, Edwards-Helaire rushed for a career-high 188 yards and three TDs and No. 1 LSU remained unbeaten with a 56-20 victory over reeling Arkansas on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"What a showing on offense - and we're not done yet," Orgeron said, referring as much to all 11 games this season as to the Tigers' 612 total yards against Arkansas.</p>
      <p>LSU (11-0, 7-0) can finish no worse than in a tie for first with Alabama (10-1, 6-1) in the SEC West and owns the tiebreaker with its 46-41 triumph in Tuscaloosa on Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>"We expected this coming into the year. If we were not 11-0 right now, we would be disappointed," Burrow said. "That's a testament to our hard work, but we've got more ahead of us."</p>
      <p>Each time Edwards-Helaire broke loose for a score - his other TDs went for 27 and 26 yards - he left at least one defensive back grasping at air. On his 89-yarder, he was about to be caught from behind but used a high-step to slip the tackle before resuming his gallop to the goal line as the Tiger Stadium crowd roared for a Baton Rouge native having a career night.</p>
      <p>"I went in and it was like, ‘Get the yard, get out of bounds, shut it down for the rest of the game,'" said Edwards-Helaire, who has 15 TDs rushing this season. "But that hole parted like the Red Sea.'"</p>
      <p>Burrow's first touchdown was a 37-yarder to Ja'Marr Chase on the game's first possession. They connected on a 50-yarder in the third quarter on which Burrow eclipsed 4,000 yards for the season and Chase increased in single-season LSU record for TD catches to 15.</p>
      <p>Burrow's other touchdown toss was a 10-yarder on a crossing route to Justin Jefferson.</p>
      <p>Interim Arkansas coach Barry Lunney Jr. started freshman quarterback KJ Jefferson, who exhibited potential and athleticism, if not consistency. Jefferson, the fourth starting QB for the Razorbacks this season, completed 7 of 14 passes for 105 yards without a turnover. He also looked effective rushing at times, but his total in that department was skewed by three sacks.</p>
      <p>"He competed hard but we didn't have enough gas in our tank to hang with these guys for four quarters," Lunney said.</p>
      <p>The Razorbacks (2-9, 0-7), who've lost eight straight, were as close as 7-6 in the second quarter after Jefferson led them to their second field goal - a 47-yarder by Connor Limpert.</p>
      <p>That's when LSU began to pull away. Burrow completed four quick passes for 66 yards to set up Tyrion Davis-Price's 2-yard touchdown to make it 14-6. By halftime, the Tigers led 28-6.</p>
      <p>LSU led 56-6 on John Emery's 39-yard run before Arkansas scored two late touchdowns, the second coming after an onside kick that squirted to the LSU 11 before the Razorbacks recovered.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>Arkansas: Lunney had the Hogs energized and playing hard throughout. They lost by less than the six-TD spread set by Las Vegas odds makers. Meanwhile, Jefferson was making a solid case to keep the starting job another week but left the game after taking a hard hit as he threw.</p>
      <p>Lunney said Jefferson would be evaluated for a concussion, but added, "He's very talented. There's no doubt about that."</p>
      <p>LSU: Burrow, a front-running candidate for the Heisman Trophy, completed 82 percent of his passes against Arkansas and now has 4,014 yards and 41 TDs passing this season, both LSU single-season records. Edwards-Helaire has been virtually unstoppable in LSU's past four games, during which he's piled up 814 yards and nine TDs from scrimmage.</p>
      <p>"I knew he was going to have a lot of success for us and I knew that this offense fit him perfectly. We use him like that guy over there in New Orleans," Burrow said, referring to Saints running back Alvin Kamara.</p>
      <p>DEFENSIVE STANDOUT</p>
      <p>LSU defensive back Jacoby Stevens had all three LSU sacks and also batted a pass right back at him, which Jefferson caught for a completion to himself, albeit for a loss of 8 when Stevens immediately smothered him.</p>
      <p>SEC HISTORY</p>
      <p>LSU became the first team in SEC history to have a 4,000-yard passer (Burrow), two 1,000-yard receivers (Chase and Jefferson) and a 1,000-yard rusher (Edwards-Helaire) in the same season.</p>
      <p>THE BOOT</p>
      <p>While LSU won "The Boot," a gold trophy in the shape of the states of Arkansas and Louisiana, the Tigers didn't celebrate with it.</p>
      <p>"There was going to be not too much of a celebration to beat Arkansas. They haven't beat anybody in a long time," Orgeron said. "We don't feel like we've accomplished what we want to accomplish yet."</p>
      <p>UP NEXT:</p>
      <p>Arkansas: Tries to avoid a second-straight season with fewer than three victories when the Hogs host Missouri on Friday in their season finale.</p>
      <p>LSU: Looks to close out its first unbeaten regular season since 2011 when the Tigers host Texas A&amp;M on Saturday.</p>
