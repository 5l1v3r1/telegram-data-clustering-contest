      <p>Along with the post, she posted a picture in which she can be seen holding the film’s clapboard.</p>
      <p>Prior to film debut, Krystle recently made her foray in the web space with the show <i>“Fitrat”.</i></p>
      <p>Krystle wasn’t the original choice for the film, as prior to her the makers had roped in Housefull 4 actress Kriti Kharbanda as the leading lady for Chehre, but following some reasons Kriti got replaced by Krystal.</p>
