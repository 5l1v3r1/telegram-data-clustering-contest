        <i>Golden Horse chairman Ang Lee says the lack of mainland talent was a ‘loss’ after Beijing was angered by criticism last year</i>
      </p>
      <p>A Taiwanese family drama, A Sun, has won the top prizes at the Golden Horse film awards – dubbed the “Chinese Oscars” – in a year marked by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/07/china-to-boycott-chinese-oscars-taiwan-golden-horse-awards-taipei">the conspicuous absence of talent from the mainland</a> amid plummeting ties between Taiwan and Beijing.</p>
      <p>The ceremony in Taipei on Saturday night was boycotted by China <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/chinas-oscars-tawian-independence-golden-horse-awards-beijing-cuts-live-coverage">after a Taiwanese director called for the island’s independence</a> in an acceptance speech at last year’s event.</p>
      <p>The acclaimed Hong Kong director Johnnie To resigned as head of the jury, citing contractual obligations, as several Hong Kong films reportedly also dropped out under pressure from Beijing.</p>

      <p>In another move likely to annoy Beijing, Taiwanese composer Lu Luming voiced support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests at this year’s ceremony, dedicating his best original film song award to “Hong Kongers who insist on ideals, and may you live safely and freely”.</p>
      <p>The Golden Horse festival’s chairman, Oscar-winning director Ang Lee, said the absence of Chinese talent was “a loss”.</p>
      <p>“This is not easy to comment on, everyone knows that,” said Lee, who is Taiwanese. “Of course it is a loss, which can be seen on the red carpet or in the works participating in the film festival.</p>

      <p>“We of course feel regret due to fewer (movies and participants) this year but our arms are opened forever, as long as you are a Chinese-speaking movie director we are welcoming you.”</p>
      <p>The night’s biggest winner was A Sun, directed by Taiwan’s Chung Mong-hong. It scooped the best picture, best director, best actor, best supporting actor and best editing awards.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would take several more years for me to win best picture. I am very happy ... although the movies I made haven’t made any profit,” Chung said after receiving the award from the Lee.</p>
      <p>Singapore-based Malaysian Yeo Yann-Yann was crowned best actress for playing a married teacher struggling with family and work woes who develops a forbidden relationship with a male pupil in the Singaporean drama Wet Season.</p>

      <p>“It’s not easy going down the path in the entertainment (industry) in Singapore and Malaysia ... but I will continue walking the path,” she said at the ceremony in Taipei’s Sun Yat-sen memorial hall.</p>
      <p>China considers democratic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan">Taiwan</a> as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary, even though the two sides have been governed separately for the last seven decades.</p>
      <p>Beijing has been ramping up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan ever since president Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016, because her party refuses to recognise that the island is part of “one China”.</p>
      <p>Pressure is building once more as Taiwan heads towards new elections in January, with Tsai seeking to defeat an opponent who favours much warmer ties with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>.</p>
