      <p>The first full trailer for Hunters has been released. The clip delineates the David Weil creation as a Nazi hunting TV series set in 1970s New York City. Al Pacino’s Meyer Offerman leads a pack of Hunters — who have discovered that various Nazi officials wish to establish the Fourth Reich in the United States.</p>
      <p>A little like Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, the Hunters set out to hunt and kill the Nazis before they can accomplish their bloody plans. And just like the Tarantino film, we are told that the Nazis deserve to be shown no mercy at all, since they certainly won’t.</p>
      <p>The clip, like the teaser, is dominated by a provocative monologue from Pacino’s character, who is briefing a young group of Hunters about their mission. The series may be set more than four decades ago, it is still topical since white supremacy is still alive and, under leaders like Donald Trump, is thriving.</p>

      <p>The trailer and the series posit that there cannot be any engagement with people who are downright fascist. They deserve to be answered in their own language. Aggression should be answered with aggression.</p>
      <p>Jordan Peele’s Monkeypaw Productions is one of the production companies on the series.</p>
      <p>The official synopsis of Hunters reads, “Inspired by true events, Hunters follows a diverse band of Nazi Hunters in 1977 New York City who discover that hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in America. And so, they do what any bad-ass vigilante squad would do: they set out on a bloody quest for revenge and justice. But they soon discover a far-reaching conspiracy and must race against time to thwart the Nazis’ new genocidal plans.”</p>
      <p>Hunters arrives in 2020 on Amazon Prime Video.</p>
