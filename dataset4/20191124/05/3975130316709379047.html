      <p>Last year nearly 400 million people experienced Dengue fever, according to All Things Considered. (Just Brazil alone had more than 2 million cases.) But The World Mosquito Project is trying an interesting solution: <i>Scientists are cultivating and releasing mosquitoes, except these mosquitoes are special: They've been infected with a bacterium called <i>Wolbachia</i>. <i>Wolbachia</i> occurs naturally in many insects, but not normally in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes, which spread dengue. It has to be introduced into the mosquitoes in the lab. But then the bacterium is passed down to future generations. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/11/21/781596238/infecting-mosquitoes-with-bacteria-could-have-a-big-payoff">The bacterium appears to block <i>Aedes aegypti</i> from transmitting arboviruses</a>, which include dengue as well as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika...<br/><br/>"In Indonesia, we've [released Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in] a community of 50,000 people and compared it to a community that was left without Wolbachia," says Cameron Simmons, director of the impact assessment team for the <a href="http://www.eliminatedengue.com/media/index/view/media/30/type/spokespeople">World Mosquito Program</a>. "We've seen a 75% reduction [of dengue cases] over the last 2 1/2 years in the Wolbachia-treated community...." The problem in the real world is that other people and other mosquitoes keep migrating into the areas being treated, messing up the experiments. But from a theoretical perspective Simmons sees Wolbachia as potentially a way to wipe out dengue entirely.<br/><br/>"If you had a big island," he proposes, "[and] you stop people from moving in and out of that island, and you put <i>Wolbachia</i> across all the mosquitoes on that island, the science suggests that you'll eliminate dengue in that location."<br/><br/>Some countries are trying to do just that. Australia started using <i>Wolbachia</i>-infected mosquitoes nearly a decade ago to control outbreaks of imported dengue in the state of Queensland. This year the government of Malaysia launched a campaign called "<a href="https://www.imr.gov.my/wolbachia/">Wolbachia Malaysia</a>" to attack dengue.</i></p>
