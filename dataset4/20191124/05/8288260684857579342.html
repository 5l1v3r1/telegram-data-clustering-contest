      <h1>You could own two homes for £40k in Great Barr - and they're next door to each other</h1>
      <h2>The semi-detached properties, located on Ennerdale Road, are in walking distance of a primary school and Hamstead train station</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Stephanie Balloo, https://www.facebook.com/MissBalloo/</a></address>
      <p>You could own TWO three-bedroom homes for less than a fifth of the price of an average city home.</p>
      <p>A pair of adjoining semi-detached properties, located on Ennerdale Road in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/great-barr">Great Barr</a>, could both be yours for just £40,000 - in theory.</p>
      <p>The vacant freehold houses are currently listed on Rightmove and Zoopla for a bargain guide price of £20,000 each.</p>
      <p>Set back from the road and situated near the junction of Langdale Road, the homes are in walking distance of St Mark's Catholic Primary School and Hamstead train station.</p>

        <figcaption>The two semi-detached houses up for sale</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Buyers will have the opportunity to bid on the houses when they go to auction next month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>House 1 (left)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The home on the left of the image boasts a downstairs toilet, a reasonably-sized kitchen diner, a front garden and a driveway on the ground floor.</p>
      <p>Upstairs, a landing leads off to three bedrooms and a bathroom with a second toilet fitted.</p>
      <p>With dated carpets and wallpaper in some rooms, it's in need of a little TLC.</p>
      <p>But it could prove a wise investment with nearby three-bed homes up for sale for as much as £250,000.</p>
      <p>The Rightmove mortgage calculator estimates monthly payments of just £80 with a £2,000 deposit on the property.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-66107076.html">The advert</a> adds: "The property benefits from having a gas fired central heating system and UPVC double glazing."</p>
      <p>
        <b>House 2 (right)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The adjoining property also has three bedrooms and a bathroom stemming from a landing upstairs, but the<a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/53276922?search_identifier=a35a50191ab80e30e07bc90c316e3923"> Zoopla advert</a> boasts a front and rear garden.</p>
      <p>It is said to have two reception rooms, a rear lobby, a downstairs toilet, a hall and a kitchen downstairs.</p>
      <p>Both properties will be up for auction on December 11, 2019 at the Holte Suite, Aston Villa FC, Trinity Rd, Birmingham B6 6HE.</p>
