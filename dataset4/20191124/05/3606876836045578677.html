      <p>A police officer involved in the investigation was quoted stating that “This man is very crucial in this investigation, he has everything. He is ready to tell what transpired.”</p>
      <p>“In fact, he said he has been very stressed and has not eaten since that night.” Added the officer.</p>
      <p>Siaya County police Commander Francis Kooli revealed that the investigatios will be handled by a team from the county headquarters to avoid interference from the officer’s colleagues at Ugunja Police Station and promised to get to the root of Mr Oloo’s death.</p>

          <p>The results revealed that the Siaya-based journalist died as a result of trauma in his head and abdomen inflicted by a blunt object, possibly by a hammer or a club.</p>
          <p>The lead pathologist, Dr Gabriel Juma also said there was heavy bleeding in the journalist’s brain and abdomen with four injuries in the forehead that were visible.</p>
          <p>“There was rupture of the spleen that led to bleeding in the abdomen,” he said.</p>
