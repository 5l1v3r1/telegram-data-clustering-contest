        <li>Sharad Pawar's daughter Surpriya Sule posted another emotional status on WhatsApp</li>
        <li>Sule said it is one of the toughest days in her life</li>
        <li>arlier on Saturday, Sule expressed displeasure over Ajit Pawar's move to side with the BJP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP and Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule on Sunday said she is gearing up for "one of the toughest days" of her life ahead of key Supreme Court hearing on governor's decision to appoint Devendra Fadnavis as Maharashtra Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>In her latest WhatsApp stories, Sule said, "Good morning...values will eventually win...honesty and hard work never goes (to) waste...that path is harder but sustains long term."</p>
      <p>"One of the toughest days of my life...makes me stronger....thank each one who reached out to us in this difficult time," she added.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Saturday, Sule expressed displeasure over Ajit Pawar's move to side with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said, "Party and family split."</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, Supriya Sule's cousin Ajit Pawar sworn in as deputy chief minister of Maharashtra while BJP's Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister of the state for the second time.</p>
      <p>The unexpected development came just a day after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray emerged as the Sena-NCP-Congress' consensus candidate for the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, however, said it was his nephew Ajit Pawar's own decision, and not that of the party, to support the BJP to form the government. Ajit Pawar was also removed as the leader of NCP legislative party on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Both Shiv Sena and Congress leaders have slammed Ajit Pawar and accused him of backstabbing them by joining hands with the BJP at the last moment.</p>
      <p>Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena had filed a joint plea urging the Supreme Court to conduct an urgent hearing on the appointment of Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister.</p>
      <p>They have also demanded an immediate floor test as they are confident that the BJP will not have the required number of MLAs to form the government. At present, NCP has the support of 51 MLAs, claimed Jayant Patil, who replaced Ajit Pawar as the party's legislative leader.</p>
      <p>Patil said he also plans to meet Ajit Pawar and convince him to return to the party. For now, all eyes will be on the Supreme Court hearing as it will decide the future course of action in the Maharashtra political twist.</p>
