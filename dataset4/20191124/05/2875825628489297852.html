      <h2>Fraser has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Everton - and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe accepts this could be winger's last season with Cherries</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:14:02+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:14</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe admitted Ryan Fraser is 'keeping his options open' amid speculation linking him with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Winger Fraser is out of contract at Bournemouth at the end of this season, and so far there have been no signs of him signing a new deal.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been linked with a switch to Premier League leaders Liverpool as Jurgen Klopp considers adding depth to his fearsome frontline of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> are also rumoured to be interested in the Scotland international, who provided 14 assists in the Premier League last season - second only to Eden Hazard who notched one more for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>And now Cherries boss Howe has acknowledged that his time working with Fraser at Bournemouth could be running out.</p>

      <p>Howe said: “In terms of his contract, that’s obviously for him to decide what he wants to do with his future.</p>
      <p>“We would love him to stay and commit to us but, if not, we need to get the best out of him between now and the end of the season.</p>
      <p>"We’ve had conversations with Ryan to try and persuade him to stay but, at the moment, he’s keeping his options open.”</p>
      <p>Fraser <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ryan-fraser-hands-liverpool-transfer-20912314">has admitted he is a "loner"</a> at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> after best pal Marc Pugh left to join Queens Park Rangers.</p>

      <p>“He’s my best mate off the pitch so to see him go on loan (to Hull last season) was hard," Fraser told the <a href="https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/18042614.seeing-friends-like-marc-pugh-depart-afc-bournemouth-hard-take-admits-ryan-fraser/">Bournemouth Echo.</a></p>
      <p>“I was obviously back to being a loner again!</p>
      <p>“Me, Shaun MacDonald and Wes Fogden always used to do stuff together.</p>
      <p>“So obviously losing one and then we keep losing them and then last season was hard – I used to go and have a coffee with Pughie, but it wasn’t like that. So you end up just going home and doing nothing.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to take.”</p>
