      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/all-elite-wrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a> star Britt Baker was shown on camera tonight at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>NXT TakeOver: WarGames, when Tommaso Ciampa dropped Adam Cole through a table. During the post-show media call, WWE EVP <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a> talked about the same and stated that he felt bad for putting Baker in that position.</p>
      <p>The main event of tonight's NXT TakeOver: WarGames was a 4-on-4 WarGames match, pitting Adam Cole, Roderick Strong, Bobby Fish, and Kyle O'Reilly against Tommaso Ciampa, Keith Lee, Dominik Dijakovic, and Kevin Owens. Adam Cole's girlfriend <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/britt-baker">Britt Baker</a> was in attendance at tonight's event. The match ended when Tommaso Ciampa put Adam Cole through a table and pinned him to secure a victory for his team. Immediately after the spot, the camera <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/aew-star-britt-baker-acknowledged-during-wwe-nxt-takeover-662604">panned </a>to several shocked faces of fans in the crowd, one of which was Britt Baker's. Mauro Ranallo acknowledged that Baker is Cole's girlfriend.</p>
