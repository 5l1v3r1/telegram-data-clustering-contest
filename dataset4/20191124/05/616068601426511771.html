      <p>Oliver town council will be considering waiving or reducing the development cost charges associated with an affordable housing complex near the airport. </p>
      <p>The proposed affordable housing project at 5931 Airport Street is requesting a waiving or reduction of the $225,000 developmental cost charges payable at time of building permit issuance. </p>
      <p>Council will discuss Monday whether to waive the DCCs for the proposed complex or provide a discount, given that they have requested reduced fees in their capacity as a low income housing project. </p>
      <p>The Airport Street development is set to commence work in early 2020, prior to the adoption of the new DCC bylaw in mid to late 2020.</p>
      <p>Council will have the chance to weigh in on the matter this week.</p>
      <p>A staff report states they will be looking at ways to ensure an agreement " would ensure that the form of tenure of the housing units are limited to rental tenure," to contribute to solutions to the ongoing housing crisis. </p>
      <p>Oliver council will discuss the issue at Monday's meeting. </p>
