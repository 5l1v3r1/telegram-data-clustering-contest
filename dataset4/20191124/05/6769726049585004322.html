      <p>MANDURAH businesses and community organisations are joining together to put a freeze on Ice in our community.</p>
      <p>Mandurah Rotary clubs, Peel Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and Peel Thunder Football Club have organised for the Australian Anti Ice Campaign (AAIC) to hold a community forum in Mandurah.</p>
      <p>Rotary District 9465 assistant governor Marg Pantall said the forum was in response to overwhelming community requests.</p>
      <p>AAIC business development officer Glenn Ivers said Ice was an ever-increasing epidemic.</p>
      <p>“The aim of the forum is to educate, raise awareness and provide access to support services for people struggling with Ice addiction and families struggling with a loved one using Ice,” Mr Ivers said.</p>
      <p>“The forum also aims to introduce the AAIC Ice Specific Education, Awareness and Brief Intervention Program to the community.”</p>
      <p>Ms Pantall said the amazing program was about to hit Mandurah high schools.</p>
      <p>“So this is an opportunity for members of the community to come along and hear about it,” she said.</p>
      <p>The AAIC Program is designed to complement and work together with existing community groups and programs.</p>
      <p>About 250 people are expected at the free forum, including representatives from rehabilitation and detox facilities, schools, clubs, police, ambulance, hospitals and service providers, and local state and federal political representatives.</p>
      <p>Mr Ives said AAIC state manager Jay Birch spoke about his experiences on Ice to about 100 year 12 John Tonkin College students before they went celebrate leavers week.</p>
      <p>“The room transformed when he spoke,” Mr Ives said. “Students were moved and some were crying.”</p>
