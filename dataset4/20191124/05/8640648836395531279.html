      <h1>LETTER: Are the Californians moving to Nevada all liberal?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bruce Kester, Henderson</a></address>
      <p>With all the rancor over Californians moving to Nevada and the Silver Stateâ€™s liberal direction, I would love to see an interesting poll conducted. I would love to see a poll of the number of native-born liberals in our state versus the number of liberal California transplants.</p>
      <p>Something tells me the percentage of native-born liberals accounts for the strong conservative voting history Nevada has always had. Now, of course, all three branches of our state government are headed as far left as California.</p>
