      <p>Boris Johnson pledged to “get Brexit done” and re-unite the country as he launched the Tory General Election manifesto.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event in Telford, the Prime Minister promised a programme of investment for the NHS and the police while freezing key tax rates.</p>
      <p>He sought to characterise the election contest as a battle between “retrograde destructive socialism” under Labour and “sensible one nation Conservatism” under the Tories.</p>
      <p>“In this manifesto there is a vision for the future in which we unite our country,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is time to unleash the potential of our country and forge a new Britain.”</p>
      <p>The manifesto includes:</p>
      <p>– A “triple tax lock” with no increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT for five years</p>
      <p>– An additional 20,000 police officers and 50,000 extra nurses with the return of nurse bursaries, which were scrapped by the Tories in 2016</p>
      <p>– £1 billion of additional funding for social care in every year of the next Parliament</p>
      <p>– A new deal for towns, cutting taxes for small high street retailers and installing more CCTV</p>
      <p>– An Australian-style points based system to control immigration after Britain has left the EU</p>
      <p>– A pledge to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050</p>
      <p>–  A £1 billion boost for “wraparound” childcare after school time and during the holidays</p>
      <p>– Maintaining the pensions triple lock, winter fuel payment and the older person’s bus pass</p>
      <p>–  £2 billion for the “biggest ever” pothole repair programme as part of the national infrastructure strategy</p>
      <p>– Scrapping NHS hospital car parking charges for staff working night shifts, the disabled and the terminally ill and their families.</p>

      <p>The manifesto document contained few surprises with most of the main policies trailed in advance.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson poured scorn on Jeremy Corbyn’s plans for a second EU referendum in which he would remain neutral.</p>
      <p>He said that if he was returned to No 10 he would take Britain out the European Union within a “few weeks”.</p>
      <p>“Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and our minds on the priorities of the British people,” he said</p>
      <p>“We will invest millions more every week in science, in schools, in apprenticeships and in infrastructure, and control our debt at the same time .”</p>
