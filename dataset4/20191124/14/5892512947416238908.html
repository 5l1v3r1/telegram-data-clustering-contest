      <p>Even without the UFC in action this weekend, there were knockouts galore across the rest of the combat sports world. You had Deontay Wilder’s impressive KO of Luiz Ortiz <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/24/20980003/knockout-watch-deontay-wilder-vs-luis-ortiz-2-full-fight-video-highlights-fox-ppv-ufc-fury-boxing">(watch the finish here)</a> and then over in Chicago you have this impressive knockout from the Glory 72 Superfight Series between heavyweights John King and Tom Matlon.</p>
      <p>Watch the whole match, courtesy of Glory Kickboxing:</p>

      <p>It took King just 10 seconds (including the ref’s count) to put Matlon down on the mat where he lay like a corpse until the ref waved things off. Right from the opening bell he stalked forward, taking a kick to the body before responding with a big overhand right that staggered Matlon. A tight left seemed to be the punch that really did the damage but King hit him again going down for good measure with another right.</p>
      <p>It’s a bit of art and a new record for Glory Kickboxing that we imagine will stand for a while.</p>
