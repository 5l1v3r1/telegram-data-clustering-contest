      <p>The Cyber Crime Unit of Delhi Police has arrested six men, including a senior citizen, for allegedly sharing sexually offensive content involving children online, said police Saturday.</p>
      <p>Police said the accused — Lok Raj (61), Narendra Kumar (22), Sanju Rathod (25), Amit Mandal (24), Sudama Ram (29) and Revti Nandan (34) — allegedly shared the content on social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Anyesh Roy, DCP (Cyber Crime), said the men were caught with the help of an international forum called National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The forum submitted information about content related to child pornography. “We received help from the forum, using which we identified the accused. We then traced and arrested them. The devices used to share the offensive content have also been seized. In most cases, the accused received content on WhatsApp, which they put up on <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a>, Instagram and Snapchat,” said Roy.</p>
      <p>The DCP added that while some of the accused created fake IDs on different platforms to share the content, some posted it from their original accounts. Police said they also used CyberTips, a tool by Facebook, to identify users sharing the offensive content.</p>
      <p>Police said that while Lok Raj runs a grocery store, Kumar is an engineering student. Rathod is a labourer and Mandal works in the housekeeping department of an automobile company, said police, adding that Ram works as a cashier in a store and Nandan is a tailor.</p>
