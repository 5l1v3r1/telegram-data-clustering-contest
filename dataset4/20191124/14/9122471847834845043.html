      <h1>ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit Releases His New Top 6</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:31:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit has updated his personal rankings following Week 13 of the 2019 regular season. There’s been a bit of a shakeup.</p>
      <p>The most-notable result of Week 13 came late on Saturday night, when No. 6 Oregon was upset by Arizona State. The Ducks are now out of the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>LSU, Ohio State and Clemson have a strong hold on the playoff’s top three spots, but the No. 4 spot is pretty wide open. Oregon’s loss could open the door for a team like Alabama or Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit has updated his rankings following Saturday night:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If Utah or Oklahoma wins out, one of those two teams is probably going to get the No. 4 spot. The Crimson Tide could sneak in, though, especially if they’re able to blow out Auburn.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be out on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>We’ll have a better sense of the race for the No. 4 spot then.</p>
