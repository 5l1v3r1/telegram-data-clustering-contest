      <h1>Report: Floyd Mayweather targeting bouts with a UFC fighter and Manny Pacquiao in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anton Tabuena</a></address>
      <p>After being seen in public with Dana White, Floyd Mayweather took to social media to announce that he is coming<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/22/20977325/floyd-mayweather-says-hes-coming-out-of-retirement-working-with-dana-white-on-spectacular-event"> out of retirement in 2020, and will be working with the UFC</a> for a “spectacular event.”</p>
      <p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/floyd-mayweather-2-fights-2020-ufc-crossover/">TMZ Sports</a>, the undefeated professional boxer is targeting to have not just one, but two big money fights in 2020. The plan, which the report calls “very fluid and could change with the wind,” would be for Mayweather to face one pro-boxer and one UFC fighter, with the dates being on May and September of 2020.</p>
      <p>The MMA fighter he’s interested in facing wasn’t mentioned, but TMZ’s sources say that it would “preferably” be a UFC star that has “impressed with stand-up striking skills.” As for the professional boxer, they’re reportedly looking at a rematch with Manny Pacquiao.</p>
      <p>A second bout with the Filipino boxer has long been rumored, and with Pacquiao switching from Bob Arum to Al Haymon, negotiations would conceivably be much easier this time around.</p>

      <p>Mayweather, who is 50-0 as a professional, will be 43-years-old by those two dates that were mentioned in 2020. He officially retired (again) after a 2017 win over Conor McGregor, but also took an exhibition bout in 2018 where he <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/12/31/18162452/rizin-ff-14-results-floyd-mayweather-stops-tenshin-nasukawa-in-round-1-of-boxing-exhibition-nye">knocked out Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.</a></p>
