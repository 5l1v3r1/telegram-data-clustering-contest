      <p>The Labour Party must scrap the Trident nuclear programme to gain support from the SNP, the Scottish First Minister has said.</p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon has listed a second independence vote and more power given to Holyrood as part of her demands before an alliance can take place.</p>
      <p>She added that stopping <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> and bringing a ‘real end to austerity’ would also ‘resonate strongly with many people across the UK’, including her supporters in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Sturgeon insisted that she wants a second vote on Scottish Independence in the second half of 2020.</p>
      <p>The SNP leader said: ‘My position, and the one I would expect Labour to respect if they wanted SNP support, is the question of if there is an independence referendum.</p>

      <p>Sturgeon questioned whether Labour were ‘really going to turn their back’ on stopping austerity, welfare cuts and ending Universal Credit, just to ‘block the right of people to decide their own future’.</p>
      <p>She added that a hung Parliament where the SNP held the balance of power ‘would give Scotland maximum influence’ and make sure their ‘voice is heard’.</p>
      <p>The First Minister said her party would ‘never, ever put Boris Johnson into Downing Street’, but would not enter a formal coalition with Jeremy Corbyn, instead stating that it would be a ‘less formal arrangement’.</p>
      <p>Her comments came after shadow chancellor John McDonnell said a Labour government would not hold a second independence vote for at least two or three years.</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘I wouldn’t expect anything in the first two or three years because the Scottish people themselves are saying we’ve got to concentrate on austerity and get that sorted.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve got to concentrate on sorting out Brexit. Above all else we’ve got an existential threat of climate change. That’s a huge agenda.</p>
      <p>‘We see the independence issue in terms of a potential referendum as a distraction from that.’</p>
      <p>McDonnell insisted there would be no change to that stance, even if the SNP made holding a referendum in 2020 a red line in post-election negotiations.</p>
      <p>Corbyn previously stated that such a referendum could not take place in the first five-year parliamentary term if he was prime minister.</p>
