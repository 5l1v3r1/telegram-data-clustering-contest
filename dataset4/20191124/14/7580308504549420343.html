      <p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte fired Vice President and arch-critic Leni Robredo from her post as overseer of his deadly drug war Sunday, an aide said, just days after calling her a “scatterbrain” not to be trusted with state secrets.</p>
      <p>Robredo, 54, lasted less than three weeks as head of Duterte’s signature anti-narcotics campaign, which she vowed to reform amid allegations police were committing crimes against humanity in killing thousands of drug suspects.</p>
      <p>“The Vice-President resorted to unduly baiting international attention on the matter,” Duterte spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a statement announcing Robredo’s immediate dismissal.</p>
      <p>“Essentially, what the Vice-President has done is to embarrass our country,” Panelo added.</p>
      <p>The decision came after Duterte and his political allies publicly criticised Robredo, who had vowed to end “senseless” killing in the drug war after her appointment.</p>
      <p>Duterte took issue Tuesday with Robredo’s meeting US embassy and United Nations drug experts.</p>
      <p>“I do not trust her,” Duterte told reporters, calling Robredo a “scatterbrain” who could inadvertently share sensitive security matters with outsiders.</p>
      <p>After the public tongue-lashing, Robredo said the president should fire her if she didn’t have his trust.</p>
      <p>Robredo, who was elected separately from the president, surprisingly accepted Duterte’s offer of the post despite advisers warning her it was a trap.</p>
      <p>Duterte had previously derided the capability of Robredo to lead the country — which she would have to do if the president dies or cannot function.</p>
      <p>The drug war is overwhelmingly backed by Filipinos, but critics allege it is a war on the urban poor with the side effect of unleashing a rush of killings linked to everything from personal disputes to political rivalries.</p>
      <p>Police say they have killed just over 5,500 alleged dealers and users who fought back during arrest, but watchdogs say the true toll is at least four times higher.</p>
