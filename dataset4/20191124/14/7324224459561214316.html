      <p>Jacqueline Jossa’s husband Dan Osborne has pleaded with I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! viewers to stop voting for her to do trials because it is making her upset.</p>
      <p>Osborne told his one million Instagram followers to “give her a break” after she was chosen to do yet another Bushtucker Trial in Saturday’s episode of the jungle show.</p>
      <p>Jossa, 27, broke down in tears when hosts Ant and Dec revealed she had been voted to do the challenge along with former footballer Ian Wright.</p>

      <p>She put her head in her hands as she cried, and said: “I don’t want to do any more man.”</p>
      <p>Former The Only Way Is Essex and Celebrity Big Brother star Osborne posted a video on his Instagram Story later on, telling his followers: “I know I said to you all to vote for Jac, because she ain’t in there to change lightbulbs.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t mean like, every single trial.</p>
      <p>“Give her a break now, come on.”</p>
      <p>He said she “keeps smashing them all” regardless of being “worried about it”.</p>
      <p>“She’ll keep proving everyone (wrong), and she’s doing it with Ian Wright as well, which is good. He’ll look after her.</p>

      <p>“But let her do this one and just give her a break please because she’s getting upset now, and it ain’t nice.”</p>
      <p>Jossa and Wright were tasked with taking part in a challenge called Crevice Of Cruelty.</p>
      <p>In a preview clip of their trial ahead of Sunday’s episode, the pair were seen screaming with fear while in a tight spot underground, begging each other to rush through the task as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
