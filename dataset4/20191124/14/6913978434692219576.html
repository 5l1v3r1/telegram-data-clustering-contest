      <p><b>BERLIN —</b> Managerless Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the Bundesliga to just a point with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf Saturday as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at Union Berlin.<br/><br/>Bayern's interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his third straight win since Niko Kovac was sacked earlier this month as the Bavarians stayed third in the table.<br/><br/>Despite rumors linking ex-Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino to the Bayern vacancy, Flick has been told he will be in charge until at least Christmas.<br/><br/>"I can imagine a lot, but there's still a long way to go," Flick replied when asked if he could imagine being made head coach permanently.<br/><br/>"I enjoy the here and now. It will be like that until Christmas and I'm just trying to do my job well."<br/><br/>A showdown beckons in a fortnight when current leaders Moenchengladbach host Bayern at Borussia Park.<br/><br/>"We feel good, as you can see on the pitch. And I think the way we are playing, and the results, speak for themselves," said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller.<br/><br/>Bayern routed Duesseldorf with goals by Philippe Coutinho, Serge Gnabry, Benjamin Pavard and Corentin Tolisso, with Robert Lewandowski failing to score in a league game for the first time this season and ending his record 11-match run.<br/><br/>The win leaves Bayern third and level on 24 points with Leipzig, who enjoyed a 4-1 home win over strugglers Cologne, who played their first game under new coach Markus Gisdol.<br/><br/>Germany striker Timo Werner celebrated becoming the youngest player to make 200 Bundesliga appearances by opening the scoring for Leipzig after a great cross from winger Christopher Nkunku on 22 minutes.<br/><br/>Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg converted a penalty with half an hour played after a foul on Nkunku before midfielder Konrad Laimer added the hosts's third goal eight minutes before the break.<br/><br/>The visitors' forward Rafael Czichos pulled a goal back to make it 3-1 at half-time, before Forsberg smashed home a superb free-kick 11 minutes from the final whistle.<br/><br/>"I had a good feeling as soon as I hit it, I practice them a lot, but that one looked good," said Forsberg of his curling free-kick.<br/><br/>"We have to keep our feet on the ground and keep working hard, there are a lot of good teams playing well," he warned with just three points separating the league's top five teams.<br/><br/>Earlier, Gladbach suffered their third defeat of the season as they became the latest top six club to lose at Union.<br/><br/>"Union were ice cold ... and scored off their first chance," said Gladbach midfielder Florian Neuhaus, "we ran a lot, but we couldn't score. It's a bitter defeat."<br/><br/>Having already beaten Dortmund and Freiburg this season at their Alten Foersterei stadium, Union took the lead with 15 minutes gone when Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah headed home a cross.<br/><br/>the hosts ensured their third straight league win in stoppage time when winger Julian Ryerson floated in a cross, which deflected off a Gladbach defender to present Swedish striker Sebastian Andersson with an easy header to round off a fine win.<br/><br/>Schalke climbed to fifth as striker Benito Raman and midfielder Amine Harit scored in a 2-1 win at Werder Bremen, whose Japanese striker Yuya Osako grabbed a late consolation.<br/><br/>Freiburg are fourth despite only drawing 1-1 at ninth-placed Leverkusen, whose France Under-21 striker Moussa Diaby scored on his first start to cancel out an early Lucas Hoeler header.<br/><br/>Despite playing with 10 men for the entire second-half, mid-table Wolfsburg managed a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.<br/><br/>Their goals came from towering Dutch striker Wout Weghorst and Brazilian forward Joao Victor despite losing defender Marcel Tisserand at the end of the first-half due to a second bookable offense. — AFP</p>
