      <h1>Photo: Joe Burrow Had A Special Guest At LSU’s Game Last Night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:25:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Joe Burrow and the LSU Tigers continued their perfect season on Saturday night, dominating Arkansas at Tiger Stadium, 56-20, to move to 11-0 on the season. Burrow was his usual great self, throwing for 327 yards and three touchdowns on 23 of 28 passing.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State quarterback, who transferred to LSU two years ago, had a special guest in attendance on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>J.T. Barrett, who played with Burrow at Ohio State, was at Tiger Stadium supporting his former teammate. He was at the game with another former Buckeyes quarterback, Stephen Collier.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State star QB was wearing a Burrow No. 9 LSU jersey.</p>

      <p>Burrow remains close with several of his former Ohio State teammates. The Buckeyes have definitely been rooting for Burrow and the Tigers this season.</p>
      <p>The rooting could stop soon, though.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and LSU are both favorites to make the College Football Playoff right now. The Buckeyes and the Tigers could meet in the national title game in New Orleans at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Barrett will have to change his jersey for that one.</p>
