      <p>Google recently released an update for its Chromecast Ultra. The software update essentially provides the 4K-capable dongle with the ability to run the Stadia, the search engine’s online game-streaming service.</p>
      <p>The firmware update comes after several Chromecast Ultra owners felt that frustrated that they couldn’t gain access with their pre-Stadia Dongles. Prior to the update, Stadia was only accessible through Chromecast Ultra dongles sold either with the Premier or Founders Editions.</p>
      <p>With the firmware update, all current Chromecast Ultra owners are will only need to purchase the Stadia controller and pair them with the corresponding dongle. According to some Redditors, some users saw the update simply appear one day. To gain access to Stadia, Chromecast Ultra users need only to join the “Preview Program” on the dongle’s Home app. After a couple of reboots, the update should then take effect.</p>
