      <h1>Steven Gerrard reveals his Rangers man of the match as boss appeals for 'ruthless' streak</h1>
      <h2>The Rangers boss wants his side to be more composed in forward areas but there was one man who really impressed him.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:49:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard praised <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> as his top performer but called for his team to be more decisive in front of goal after a 3-1 win against Hamilton.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> boss was also critical of his defenders as he watched his side huff and puff to victory, with individual brilliance rather than cohesive team play making the difference.</p>
      <p>Rangers have played better but they are now grinding out results as a team challenging for the title must - something Gerrard was keen to stress despite his misgivings about the performance.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BT Sport, he said: "We have certainly played better. I thought we played good in patches today but not consistently. I thought Hamilton competed really well and done well to stay in the game.</p>
      <p>"We created enough but we weren't clinical or ruthless enough in front of goal.</p>
      <p>"I think you have to give <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton-academical-fc">Hamilton</a> credit. I think the easy one is to use the excuse of the international break but some of my better players today were my international players so we won't use that excuse. I think it's just us - at certain times we have to go and get the second goal quicker.</p>

      <p>"We were poor on their goal. We were poor in three or four positions throughout the game where we haven't won the first header so there are a lot of bones to pick over from it.</p>
      <p>"But we have won 3-1 away from home after the international break so we have to take the positives.</p>
      <p>"We can't run the risk or chance it with a performance like that. We have to perform at a better level so the results are not at risk - because it could have been in those final stages.</p>
      <p>Ryan Kent took the headlines with a double, with his first goal a barnstorming long-range finish into the top corner.</p>
      <p>And Gerrard said: "It's a fantastic strike on his weak side, if he has one, and he puts it in the top corner. It's a fantastic goal and I really like the second "goal as well as it was more of a composed finish.</p>
      <p>"Ryan (Jack) gets the first one and I thought Ryan was our best player today in terms of consistency through the 90 minutes."</p>
      <p>Hamilton counterpart <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brian-rice">Brian Rice</a> was happy with the performance, despite defeat and highlighted the display of his young players.</p>
      <p>Rice said: "We set the team up to be as positive as possible. I've got two strikers on the pitch against Rangers and I've got a young kid at 17 playing centre-half.</p>
      <p>"But they're in the team because they're good players. I like to think I'm a positive person, I try to look on the bright side of things.</p>
      <p>"I think the team today reflected everything we want to do."</p>
