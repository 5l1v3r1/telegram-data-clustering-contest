      <h3>What will be happening?</h3>
      <p>You can bring your pooch down to the grotto where there will be a waiting room which will give them a chance to meet all the other dogs.</p>
      <p>They will then be able to meet Santa and Mrs Claus and, of course, take that perfect pooch picture before your pet enjoys a special doggy treat.</p>

      <p>General manager at Mumbles Pier, Hannah Hunter said: "We pride ourselves on being a dog-friendly venue.</p>
      <p>"The dogs will be able to go through where they will be greeted by other dogs and they will be able to meet each other.</p>
      <p>"We encourage dogs to wear fancy dress and once they have had a photo with Santa they will receive a goody bag.</p>
      <p>"The bags will include toys, treats and maybe some doggy ice cream if they are lucky."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How much is it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It costs Â£9.95 per dog.</p>
