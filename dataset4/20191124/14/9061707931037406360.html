      <p>Public Health England is reporting an <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/health">outbreak of tuberculosis in Derby.</a></p>
      <p>Three fresh cases of the infectious <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/nhs">disease have been reported in the city</a> and one case has been found in Amber Valley.</p>
      <p>Medical practitioners in England and Wales have a duty to report certain serious infectious diseases in order to track and control breakouts.</p>
      <p>Tuberculosis, often referred to as TB, is a disease that usually affects the lungs.</p>
      <p>Symptoms include a persistent cough lasting several weeks, a high temperature, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite and swellings in the neck.</p>
      <p>Coughing up bloody phlegm and breathlessness are also symptoms of the disease.</p>
      <p>A bacterial infection, it usually caught through prolonged exposure to someone who is infected.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tuberculosis-tb/">The NHS website</a> says: "At risk groups include children living in areas with high rates of TB, people with close family members from countries with high TB rates and people going to live and work with people for more than three months in an area with high rates of TB.</p>
      <p>"Treatment for TB usually involves taking antibiotics for several months.</p>
      <p>"While TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.</p>
      <p>"Most people do not need to be admitted to hospital during treatment."</p>
      <p>The information about the outbreak in Derby and Derbyshire comes from <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/847360/NOIDS-weekly-report-week46-2019.pdf">Public Health England's Statutory Notifications of Infectious Diseases report</a> for the week ending Sunday, November 17.</p>
