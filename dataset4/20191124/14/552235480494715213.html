      <p>A gold mining boss found dead at a Scottish mansion killed himself after moving to north to retire, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Mark Wellesley-Wood, CEO of KEFI minerals - a British gold and copper mining company operating in Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia - was found dead by his wife Shona after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/firearms">shooting himself in the head with his shotgun</a> .</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old financier was said to be suffering from an "acute depressive illness" brought on by money worries and relationship problems brought on by the couple's move from Sussex in September 2018.</p>
      <p>He moved to the rented home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/dumbarton">Dumbarton</a> while the pair paid for renovation works on a retirement property in Alloa, near Stirling.</p>
      <p>But West Sussex Coroner's Court heard how the pair regretted the move - causing "friction".</p>
      <p>On April 25 Shona came home from having her hair done to find him lying on the on the patio of their rented home on the edge of the Highlands beside his 12 bore shotgun - used for clay pigeon shooting.</p>
      <p>She called <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/policescotland">police</a> and paramedics but Mr Wellesley-Wood was pronounced dead at the scene. A post mortem found his cause of death to be "shotgun injury to the head."</p>
      <p>Shona discovered a signed suicide note in his study after coming across his body.</p>
      <p>A summary of evidence in the case read at the hearing revealed he had been prescribed antidepressants in October 2018 after a visit to his GP Dr Julis Dunn after he "scored high on the depression scale."</p>
      <p>Geoff Charnock, coroner's officer, said: "They had moved to Scotland, from Sussex, in September 2018 and were living in a rented house in Dunbarton whilst they renovated a derelict property in Alloa</p>
      <p>|It was to be their family home in retirement. The funding for the renovations came from the sale of their house in Sussex.</p>
      <p>"This relocation caused friction in the relationship due to stresses over renovation costs and regrets about their choice of property.</p>
      <p>"Mark regularly voiced his concerns about money which developed during his semi-retirement, with a belief that they would struggle to get by on their pension pot alone.</p>
      <p>"Mark saw Dr Dunn on October 11. He scored high on the depression scale, however he denied any thoughts of self-harm but admitted feeling very low.</p>
      <p>"He was prescribed antidepressants and given leaflets with contact numbers for people to speak with regarding his financial worries. He took the medication for a number of days, however he complained to his wife about the way they made him feel."</p>
      <p>Months later, he was trying to sort out his will, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Mr Charnock continued: "At the start of April 2019, Mark had told Shona that they would have to "sort out their wills." He was adamant that this needed to be done as a priority but gave no explanation for this urgency.</p>
      <p>"When he woke up at 8am on the day of his death he skipped breakfast which was "out of character" but otherwise he seemed normal.</p>
      <p>Mr Charnock said: "Shona attended a nearby hairdressers and went shopping for dinner before returning to the home at about 3.10pm.</p>
      <p>"She parked the car in the garage and entered the front door, which was shut, but unlocked. It was common practice for them to leave the doors unlocked. She noticed that the post was still long on the internal door mat which she found strange due to the late hour.</p>
      <p>"She returned to her car to ensure it was locked and then entered the house again.</p>
      <p>'As she walked through the ground floor she saw no sign of Mark. As she walked through the living room she could see Mark's body, through the patio doors, lying on the ground outside with blood coming from his head.</p>
      <p>"She initially thought that he had suffered a heart attack or a stroke and had fallen to the ground banging his head.</p>
      <p>"Upon closer inspection she realised that he was lying next to his 12 bore shotgun. Shona contacted the emergency services and told them that she believed her husband was dead.</p>
      <p>"Whilst in the study she saw a handwritten note signed by Mark. On reading it she realised that it was in fact a suicide note.</p>
      <p>"Police attended and after appropriate enquiries confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances of evidence of a third party to the death."</p>
      <p>Coroner Karen Henderson, addressing Mark's two sons Robert and Adam - who sat in court - concluded the death was a suicide.</p>
      <p>She said: "The fact that you are both here today indicated that love and affection and respect that your father gave to you in that you gave to him during his life.</p>
      <p>"He was clearly a very successful man who has worked hard throughout his life, who was an enormous support not only to his children but also to the other aspects of his family but a decision was made to move to Scotland and there arose a fundamental problem.</p>
      <p>"There were pitfalls and friction and the marriage and money worries.</p>
      <p>"What was clear on the day of April 25 was that he had made up his mind that such was his worries and his inability to see a way through these worries to take him to undertake this act and that he intended to undertake this act and did intend this act to take his life.</p>
      <p>"It was just so tragic that he could not find a way through and we have no doubt that this was an acute depressive illness that brought this about."</p>
