      <h1>Ohio State, finally faced with adversity, has perfect response at perfect time</h1>

      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — When Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford left in the third quarter after Saturday’s game at Ohio Stadium, it looked like the best-case scenario for No. 2 Ohio State.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes led 21-0 and appeared on the way to another gap-widening blowout in the Big Ten against No. 8 Penn State. What transpired next might help the Buckeyes when they face the real national championship contenders down the line.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Nittany Lions scored 17 unanswered points behind backup quarterback Will Levis to make it a one-score game heading into the fourth quarter. For a team that entered the game outscoring its opponents 515-98, this was the first punch back of the season. Ohio State coach Ryan Day used that opportunity to gather both the offense and defense on the field after a fumble to drive that message home.</p>
      <p>"You have their attention now,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. “I know that sounds crazy now 11 weeks, 12 weeks into the season, but I think you do."</p>
      <p>In other words, the Buckeyes responded to a punch in the mouth for the first time in a 28-17 victory. Ohio State (11-0, 8-0 Big Ten) earned a third straight trip to the Big Ten championship game as a result. Penn State (9-2, 6-2) fell out of the Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Ohio State helped Penn State with two third-quarter fumbles, one each from quarterback Justin Fields and running back J.K. Dobbins, and Penn State rallied had the ball at their own 10-yard line with a chance to drive and take the lead.</p>
      <p>That’s when the Buckeyes delivered the knockout. Chase Young, who had three sacks after returning from a two-game suspension, forced a three-and-out. Fields hit Chris Olave for a 28-yard touchdown pass with 13:18 remaining, and Justin Hilliard’s interception erased Penn State’s last scoring threat.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day we have to take care of the ball,” Day said. “I said it to one of the coaches, ‘Maybe it has been a little too easy at times.’ This was hard today. We learned some lessons. Hopefully we grow from them."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ohio State made it look easy in the first half, building a 14-0 lead. Fields and Dobbins led a merciless 91-yard drive to start the game, and Fields’ fourth-and-5 scramble set up the second touchdown. Fields then hit K.J. Hill for a 21-0 lead on a 24-yard touchdown pass with 11:31 left in the third quarter. This looked like another run-of-the-mill-blowout at that point, and the final statistics still show that gap.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes outgained Penn State 396-206, and Dobbins (35 carries, 150 yards) and Fields (20 carries, 67 yards) led a rushing attack that piled up 213 yards. If not for the three turnovers, the other coming on a fumble by Fields at the goal line in the first half, then this is a blowout.</p>
      <p>Ohio State advanced to its third straight Big Ten championship game and stayed on pace with unbeatens LSU (10-0) and Clemson (11-0). That sets up Day’s first experience in "The Game" against Michigan, a rivalry Urban Meyer dominated with a 7-0 record. That game could turn out a lot like this one did at Michigan Stadium.</p>
      <p>“We live that every day,” Day said. “'The Team Up North' is something we talk about every single day.</p>
      <p>"I’m not going to sit around and think about it too much because we still have so much football ahead of us. It’s a tribute to these seniors."</p>
      <p>Day, however, wouldn't talk much about the gravity of leading the first Big Ten East championship run; It was merely on to the next test. Each one promises to be a little more difficult than the next, and from now on the other teams can throw a knockout punch.</p>
      <p>"It’s very unique that we're this far into the season before something like that would happen, but it’s true,” Day said. “Hopefully we learn from it and grow from it.”</p>
