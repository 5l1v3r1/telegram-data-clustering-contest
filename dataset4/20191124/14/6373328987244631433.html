        <b>A man has been arrested in Birmingham in connection with a racist incident towards a Jewish family, which took place on the London Underground.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The suspect was reportedly taken into police custody on Saturday, November 23, after a video filmed the day before appeared to show a man reading anti-Jewish Bible verses to a Jewish family – a couple and their three young children – as they travelled on the Northern Line.</p>
      <p>The video was filmed by a fellow commuter, who later shared it and appealed to anyone who might recognise the man to come forward.</p>

      <p>Footage of the incident reportedly shows the man reading aloud from the Bible towards the family, as the father tries to distract his son.</p>
      <p>One passenger tried to defend the family, asking the man to stop the anti-Semitic abuse, before the man threatens to punch him. A few moments later, another commuter tries to intervene, calmly questioning the man and asking him to stop the abusive behaviour.</p>
      <p>The commuter, mum-of-two Asma Shuweikh, later told reporters she knew she had to confront the man, and she ‘wouldn’t hesitate to do it again’.</p>

        <b>Asma said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I would have loved more people to come up and say something because if everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did.<br/><br/>Being a mother-of-two, I know what it’s like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation.<br/><br/>When he started talking to the child I thought, ‘no, I have to say something’. As a mother of two it’s appalling, I can’t sit back and watch that happen.</blockquote>

        <b>Asma added:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>To be honest I thought it is my duty as a mother, as a practising Muslim, as a citizen of this country, to have to say something.<br/><br/>You can’t just sit back and watch that because I felt that it was just getting out of hand. It was really getting too much.</blockquote>
      <p>The footage was recorded by Chris Atkins, who later moved to swap seats with the family so they were further away from the man. Chris told <i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50533617">BBC News</a></i>: ‘It was the children that really got me and everyone else, he was just screaming at these children. It was horrific in every sense.’</p>
      <p>Police say they have now arrested a man in Birmingham on suspicion of a racially-aggravated offence.</p>
