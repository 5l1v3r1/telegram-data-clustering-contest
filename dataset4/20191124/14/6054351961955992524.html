      <h1>Tay-K Criticizes His Management &amp; Label For How He's Portrayed In Media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:31:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/JustinI" target="_blank">Justin Ivey</a></address>
      <p>Bexar County, TX – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52491/title.tay-k-is-all-scowls-in-new-mugshot-following-55-year-sentence">Tay-K</a> was sentenced to <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52142/title.tay-k-pleads-guilty-to-aggravated-robbery-as-capital-murder-trial-begins">55 years prison</a> for his role in the 2016 murder of 21-year-old Ethan Walker, but he’s not happy with how he’s publicly perceived.</p>
      <p>After being <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53504/title.tay-k-reportedly-indicted-for-shooting-killing-man-in-chick-fil-a-parking-lot">indicted on another murder charge </a>earlier this month, the incarcerated rapper called out his management and label for encouraging him not to speak out against his portrayal in the media via Twitter on Saturday (November 23).</p>
      <p>“I wanna apologize to all my fans and supporters for letting my management and label convince me that it wouldn’t be a good decision to speak out against the way the media makes me look and the complete lies they spread,” he wrote. “but I’m gonna make sure the truth about my life and my character gets out with or without management or a label. And whoever don’t like it fuck you…”</p>

      <p>Tay-K, whose real name is Taymor McIntyre, signed with 88 Classic after his single <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44385/title.tay-k-goes-from-fugitive-to-hot-100-artist-with-the-race">“The Race”</a> became a hit in 2017. He believes his team hasn’t properly defended him in the media, so he plans to start addressing matters publicly — with or without their approval.</p>
      <p>“The way the media inaccurately portrays me has affected my life directly,” he claimed. “So instead of waiting on my ‘team’ to get the bright idea to speak up on my behalf, things will be done differently… Of course I’m not perfect or nothing, but I’m most definitely not this monster that they try to portray me as. with that being said, I also apologize for the way I may have presented myself, I was young and inconsiderate.”</p>
