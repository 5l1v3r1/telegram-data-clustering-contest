      <p>The Lagos State Government has sealed off Multipak Nigeria Ltd., a plastic producing factory, for violation of safety rules and regulations, poor house-keeping and lack of signage, which allegedly led to the death of a worker.</p>
      <p>The Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr. Lanre Mojola, made this known in an interview with the <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> in Lagos on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The company is located at Plot F8, Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun, Lagos.</p>
      <p>Mojola said the factory was sealed up following the Lagos State Government’s declaration of zero tolerance for factories and private organisations that violate safety rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>“Lagos State Government seals off Multipak factory for violation of safety rules and regulations, as well as poor house-keeping and lack of signage.</p>
      <p>“The poor house-keeping led to the untimely death of Mr. Femi Olatunde, a factory worker who got his head stuck while operating one of the machines.</p>
      <p>“On no account should any factory operate without putting in place safety equipment, quality house-keeping, signage, good wiring system and a clean environment devoid of hazards to the lives of workers and visitors,’’ Mojola said.</p>
      <p>He urged organisations and individuals to embrace best practices and international safety operations to prevent fatal incidents that endangered lives.</p>
      <p>The LSSC boss said that safety of lives and property was collective responsibility and warned that factories that violated safety rules would be severely sanctioned.</p>
