      <h1>Video: Ohio State Football Is Ready For Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:19:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State football beat Penn State at Ohio Stadium in Columbus on Saturday. There’s no time to celebrate that win over the Nittany Lions, though.</p>
      <p>It’s rivalry week now.</p>
      <p>Ohio State will head to Ann Arbor next weekend to take on Jim Harbaugh and the Michigan Wolverines, who, outside of the Buckeyes, might be playing as well as anyone in the conference.</p>
      <p>Of course, Ryan Day’s team is already ready for The Game.</p>
      <p>The Michigan rivalry is a year-long thing in Columbus. The Buckeyes have been preparing for this one all season long. Now, everything just gets intensified.</p>
      <p>“It is time,” the Buckeyes announced, crossing the “m” out.</p>

      <p>We can’t wait for this one.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan will kick off at noon E.T. in Ann Arbor on Saturday. The Buckeyes will enter the contest as a sizable favorite.</p>
      <p>The game will be televised on FOX.</p>
