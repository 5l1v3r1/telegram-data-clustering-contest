      <p>MANILA, Nov 24 — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte fired Vice President and arch-critic Leni Robredo from her post as overseer of his deadly drug war today, an aide said, just days after calling her a “scatterbrain” not to be trusted with state secrets.</p>
      <p>Robredo, 54, lasted less than three weeks steering Duterte’s signature anti-narcotics campaign, which she vowed to reform amid allegations police were committing crimes against humanity in killing thousands of drug suspects.</p>
      <p>“The Vice-President resorted to unduly baiting international attention on the matter,” Duterte spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a statement announcing Robredo’s immediate dismissal.</p>
      <p>“Essentially, what the Vice-President has done is to embarrass our country,” Panelo added.</p>
      <p>Robredo’s spokesman said he was not aware of her receiving any formal dismissal notice, adding “as usual, announced to media without the courtesy of directly informing (her)”. </p>
      <p>The decision came after Duterte and his political allies publicly criticised Robredo, who had vowed to end “senseless” killing in the campaign after her appointment.</p>
      <p>Critics were sceptical of the appointment from the start, questioning whether it was a trap to tarnish Robredo or simply an impulsive response to her repeated criticism of his drug war.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International said Rodredo’s proposals to reform the initiative were never given a real chance.</p>
      <p>“In only a few weeks, Vice President Robredo was able to confront the government with the staggering scale of its own crimes,” Executive Director Butch Olano said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“That is why she was sacked,” he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Set up to fail’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Duterte took issue Tuesday with Robredo’s meeting US embassy and United Nations drug experts.</p>
      <p>“I do not trust her,” Duterte told reporters, calling her a “scatterbrain” who could inadvertently share sensitive security matters with outsiders.</p>
      <p>After the public tongue-lashing, Robredo said the president should fire her if she didn’t have his trust.</p>
      <p>Robredo, who was elected separately from the president, surprisingly accepted on November 6 Duterte’s offer of the post despite warning it was a trap.</p>
      <p>Critics said the appointment was never a legitimate effort to include her.</p>
      <p>“From the start Robredo was set up to fail,” said opposition lawmaker Edcel Lagman. “The President cannot allow her to succeed... where he himself has failed.”</p>
      <p>Duterte had previously derided the capability of Robredo to lead the country—which she would have to do if the president dies or cannot function.</p>
      <p>The drug war is overwhelmingly backed by Filipinos, but critics allege it is a war on the urban poor with the side effect of unleashing a rush of killings linked to everything from personal disputes to political rivalries.</p>
      <p>Police say they have killed just over 5,500 alleged dealers and users who fought back during arrest, but watchdogs say the true toll is at least four times higher.</p>
      <p>International Criminal Court prosecutors have launched a preliminary probe of the killing, and the UN’s top rights body voted in favour an in-depth review. — AFP</p>
