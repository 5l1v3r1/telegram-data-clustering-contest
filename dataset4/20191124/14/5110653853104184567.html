      <h1>Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz 2 results: Wilder destroys Ortiz with one-punch KO in the 7th, retains WBC title</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:10:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Andreas Hale</a></address>
      <p>LAS VEGAS — Deontay Wilder has continued to live by the mantra that his opponents need to be perfect for 12 rounds. Meanwhile, he only needs two seconds. That's exactly what happened when Wilder dug himself out of a deep hole and obliterated Luis Ortiz with a right hand that earned him a seventh-round knockout to retain the WBC heavyweight title and keep the plans in place for a 2020 rematch with Tyson Fury.</p>
      <p>For just over six rounds, however, Ortiz was as close to perfect against Wilder as he could be in a return bout of their thrilling 2018 affair. Wilder won that fight in the 10th round after surviving a seventh in whichhe was in the most trouble he had ever been in. During the rematch, Ortiz used excellent footwork and routinely connected with a left to the body and a left hook while not allowing Wilder to land anything of significance.</p>
      <p>Wilder demonstrated impressive patience by not swarming himself. But that patience appeared to be what would have been his undoing as Ortiz racked up rounds. Wilder's lack of activity had the fans at the MGM growing impatient, and Ortiz appeared to be running away with the fight.</p>
      <p>But the two seconds Wilder needed happened at the end of the seventh round.</p>
      <p>Ortiz appeared to take control of the round but got a little reckless at the end of the round and was caught by Wilder's massive right hand that remains the most potent weapon in all of boxing. Ortiz collapsed to the canvas in a heap as Wilder knew the damage was done. Ortiz tried desperately to get to his feet but his equilibrium was shot, and referee Kenny Bayless called the fight off at the 2:51 mark.</p>
      <p>With the victory, Wilder improves to 42-0-1 with the 41st knockout of his career. Ortiz falls to 31-2 and has to live with the fact that he couldn't be as perfect as he needed to be for this fight.</p>

      <h3>Leo Santa Cruz overwhelms Miguel Flores to claim vacant WBA super featherweight title</h3>
      <p><b>Result (11:45 p.m.):</b> Leo Santa Cruz claimed another world title in his fourth weight class as he dominated a game, but overmatched Miguel Flores to earn a unanimous decision. The scores were115-112, 117-110 and117-110. Obviously, the 115-112 scorecard was a bit too close, but there was no doubt who the better man was. The biggest thing to come out of the fight was Santa Cruz calling out Gervonta Davis and Gary Russell Jr. Both are opponents that would make for excellent fights. Let's see if they come together.</p>
      <p><b>11:40 p.m.:</b> If you were looking for drama, the best you got out of this fight was a clash of heads that caused a cut of Leo Santa Cruz's left eye. Aside from that, it's been all Santa Cruz. Sorry, nothing else to see here.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>11:26 p.m.:</b> It's been wash, rinse and repeat for eightrounds as Leo Santa Cruz continues to do Leo Santa Cruz things, continuingto overwhelm Flores with his work rate. It's a typical Santa Cruz fight against lesser opposition, and Flores' lack of a big punch will likely keep him stuck in this spin cycle.</p>
      <p><b>11:03 p.m.</b> : We're now into the third round of the co-main event between Leo Santa Cruz (36-1-1, 19 KOs) and Miguel Florez (24-2, 12 KOs) for the vacant WBA World Super Featherweight Championship. Santa Cruz is a hefty favorite at 40-1 and is using his volume to take the early rounds. Flores hasn't done much to make Santa Cruz reconsider his approach of launching multiple punches and may find himself in a deep hole if this keeps up.</p>
      <h3>Brutal war between Brandon Figueroa and Julio Ceja ends in split draw   </h3>
      <p><b>Result (10:42 p.m.):</b> After over 2,800 punches thrown, Brandon Figueroa and Julio Ceja ends in a split draw with scores of115-113 for Figueroa, 116-112 for Ceja and an even score of114-114. An unreal pace that started early and never let up saw these two battle in a phone booth for 12 demanding rounds. It was a surprisingly brutal battle between a pair of guys with an impressive knockout ratio that didn't disappoint. But, in the end, the right decision was made as both fighters gave it their all and it's likely they will meet again ... as long as Ceja can make weight.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>10:34 p.m.:</b> We're heading into the final round of a really brutal battle between these two. Ceja's punches seem to have more steam on them but Figueroa refuses to step out of the phone booth and try to outbox the brawler. These scorecards are likely to be all over the place.</p>
      <p><b>10:22 p.m.:</b> It's starting to feel like Ceja is gaining momentum. His work rate has yet to slow down and it appears that his punches are starting to get to Figueroa. This a physically taxing fight for both Figueroa and Ceja. The problem is that Ceja has nothing to lose and Figueroa is eating a lot more leather than anyone anticipated. Eightrounds down and the relentless pace continues.</p>
      <p><b>10:10 p.m.:</b> This is a helluva fight between Figueroa and Ceja. If they were bigger names, this could be a Fight of the Year contender with the pace they’ve put up this far. Neither fighter has taken a break and continue to pound on each other in close quarters. You have to figure that one of them will eventually slow down, but it simply hasn't happened yet. Scorecards through fiverounds should be interesting.</p>
      <p><b>10:01 p.m.</b> : It appeared that Figueroa was going to walk right through Ceja after his opponent came in four pounds overweight. Figueroa pummeled him for the first round, but Ceja has settled in and the next two rounds were fought in a virtual phone both with both landing hard shots. It's a pretty entertaining bout thus far.</p>
      <p><b>9:50 p.m.</b> : Up next is Brandon "Heartbreaker" Figueroa (20-0, 15 KOs)vs. Julio Ceja (32-4, 28 KOs) for the WBA World Super Bantamweight title. Figueroa is the younger brother of Omar Figueroa and has shown a ton of promise. His opponent is likely remembered by most for his barnburner with Guillermo Rigondeaux back in June. Ceja was on the wrong end of that fight and lost by eighth-round TKO. It's a step up for Figueroa.</p>
      <h3>Eduardo Ramirez blasts Leduan Barthelemy for 4th-round TKO</h3>
      <p><b>Result (9:35 p.m.):</b> Well, this fight wasbetter than advertised as Ramirez took the fight to Barthelemy and cleaned his clock with a huge left hand in the fourth round that scored him a knockout victory. Prior to that, Ramirez simply couldn't miss with his power shots as Barthelemy tried to bait him in for a counter. Unfortunately forBarthelemy, he couldn't counter when he continuously ate hard shots. Eventually, it was too much as the left hand put the Cuban down. Although he would rise as the round ended, he was clearly shaken and couldn't continue. Time of stoppage was2:59.</p>

      <p><b>9:23 p.m.:</b> We're kicking off the PPV portion with Leduan Barthelemy (15-0-1, 7 KOs), brother of Rances, facing Eduardo Ramirez (22-2-3, 9 KOs) in a rematch from their split draw bout from September 2017. The fight was moved to the main card after Luis Nery failed to make weight and Emmanuel Rodriguez refused to accept the fight. It's a big blow to the card, but maybe Barthelemy and Ramirez can make us forget about it? Probably not. But we shall see.</p>
