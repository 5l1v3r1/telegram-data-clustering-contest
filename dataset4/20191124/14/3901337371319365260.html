      <p>The Brazilians secured a 2-1 win over Golden Arrows at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium, getting back to winning ways after two-match winless Absa Premiership run leading up to yesterday.</p>

      <p>Sundowns are now one step closer to finally securing a domestic cup, with their last cup silverware victory dating back to the 2015/16 season when they lifted the very same Telkom Knockout trophy.</p>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs and Maritzburg United will lock horns this afternoon in the second semi-final and as much as Chiefs could be the favourites for the encounter, the Team Of Choice can not be underestimated as they too are coming off the back of an unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>Now it remains to be seen who will join the Brazilians in at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban next month, with Sundowns possibly eyeing a revenge encounter against Amakhosi.</p>
