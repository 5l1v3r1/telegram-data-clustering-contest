        <b>The Dublin Chamber of Commerce is warning against the introduction of overly restrictive regulations on e-scooters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes as Dublin City Council calls for e-scooter users to be forced to sit a test, get tax and insurance and wear protective clothing.</p>
      <p>The opposing views are contained in submissions both bodies made to the Government’s public consultation on e-scooter use.</p>
      <p>Under current road safety legislation, e-scooters are technically illegal; however, as their popularity increases, the Government is now considering whether to update the legislation.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.dublinchamber.ie/DublinChamberofCommerce/media/banners/Dublin-Chamber_-Submission-to-DTTS_PPT_November-1st-2019.pdf">In its submission</a></b>, the Dublin Chamber said the scooters could have a key role in the effort to reduce emissions and congestion in Irish cities.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Graeme McQueen said some regulation is needed but said the Government should be very careful about being too strict.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately this has a really good potential in terms of getting people to switch to sustainable transport,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The aim is to encourage people to use them – so we have to make sure that any restrictions are not overly restrictive.”</p>
      <p>He said it would set a negative precedent if laws that were drafted for older technologies like cars were used to block new technologies as they come on the market.</p>
      <p>“New technologies are coming in all the time,” he said. “It is all about how we embrace them.”</p>
      <p>“We want to encourage as many people as possible to use them. That is going to be good for everyone in terms of sustainability and lack of congestion in the city.</p>
      <p>“I think we have to come at this from a position of, ‘how can we make this work?’ and not make it overly restrictive because ultimately we’ll end up putting people off.”</p>
      <p>The Department of Transport will consider the response to the public consultation in the coming weeks, with Minister Shane Ross to then expected to announce a decision.</p>
