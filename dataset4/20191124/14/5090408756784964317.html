      <p>What do the founders of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/youtube">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/yelp">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/tesla">Tesla</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> have in common? Apart from leading massively disruptive technology companies, their founders all share a common resume line item: employment at PayPal.</p>
      <p>Known for their entrepreneurial mindset and anti-establishment attitude, this elite group is known as the “PayPal Mafia,” and they all put in time during the payment platform’s early days some 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>Here’s a rundown of the most prominent members of this exclusive group and what they’re up to two decades later. You might want to break out your thumb tacks and red string, because the connections in this web run deep.</p>

      <h3>The so-called “don” of the PayPal Mafia is founder Peter Thiel.</h3>

      <p>Though it wouldn’t become a household name for years to come, PayPal was <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/07/paypal-puts-dough-in-your-palm/">launched all the way back in 1999</a> as an offshoot of Thiel’s first company, Confinity. The platform was intended to give consumers an easier option for transferring money from handheld devices – the PalmPilot was one such device at the time.</p>
      <p>Thiel served as CEO of PayPal until October of 2002, when <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ebay-picks-up-paypal-for-1-5-billion/">eBay acquired it for $1.5 billion</a>. Thiel’s 3.7% stake was worth a <a href="http://www.secinfo.com/dr6nd.33fd.htm">reported $55 million</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Thiel went on to cofound Founders Fund, a venture capital firm that has helped launch companies like SpaceX and Airbnb.</h3>

      <p>Thiel cofounded the big data firm Palantir in 2003. He was the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-stake/peter-thiel-sells-most-of-remaining-facebook-stake-idUSKBN1DM2BQ">first major outside investor</a> in Facebook and contributed early funding to Yelp and <a href="https://fortune.com/2014/09/04/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy/">LinkedIn</a>, along with a number of other ventures launched by his PayPal peers. Thiel continues to serve as a partner of <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/The-Founders-Fund-emerges-as-venture-capital-2-0-2543274.php">Founders Fund</a>.</p>
      <p>Thiel has also drawn criticism in recent years for his support of President Donald Trump and for secretly funding Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media, which resulted in the company shutting down Gawker and selling the company’s assets.</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiels-founders-fund-building-new-war-chest-in-strategy-shift-11571672563">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported Founders Fund is raising nearly $3 billion across two funds, one of which will pump money into late-stage startups that want to delay an IPO. Thiel is also dabbling in the growing cryptocurrency market. <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/10/15/what-is-bitcoin-mining-layer1-peter-thiel-crypto-investment/">Fortune</a> recently reported he was part of a $50 million investment in Layer1, a San Francisco-based Bitcoin-mining startup.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Levchin is sometimes called the “consigliere” of the PayPal Mafia – in “The Godfather,” a consigliere is an advisor to the boss.</p>
      <p>Levchin made significant contributions to PayPal’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-09-30/max-levchin-online-fraud-buster">anti-fraud efforts</a>. Together with PayPal technical architect David Gausebeck, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1685096/did-google-pay-182-million-new-vp">he helped create the Gausebeck-Levchin test</a>, an early version of a CAPTCHA for commercial applications.</p>
      <p>Levchin served as the chairman of Yelp from its founding in 2004 <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/07/28/paypal-co-founder-max-levchin-resigns-from-yelps-board/">until July 2015</a>.</p>

      <p>Affirm works like an instant layaway program, allowing consumers to finance online purchases at the point of sale and pay for them over time. In April, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-affirm-funding/max-levchins-affirm-raises-300-million-in-latest-funding-round-idUSKCN1RF26Q">Reuters reported</a> Affirm had raised $300 million in its latest funding round to support hiring and expansion.</p>

      <p>In 2004, the pair came up with the idea for a platform where users could leave recommendations about businesses in their area. They <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/07/23/100134489/index.htm">pitched the idea</a> to Levchin, who provided an early investment of $1 million, and Yelp was born.</p>
