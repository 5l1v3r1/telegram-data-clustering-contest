        <b>Paul Scholes has singled out Chelsea’s defenders as weak links in Frank Lampard’s Blues squad after their weekend defeat to Manchester City.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite clearly making a lot of progress under Lampard this season, Chelsea’s youthful side has tended to come up short in the big games so far.</p>
      <p>The west Londoners were thrashed 4-0 by Manchester United on the opening day of the season and have also lost now to Liverpool and City, albeit more narrowly.</p>

      <p>Scholes, however, thinks these defeats against the big teams show that Lampard has problems at Stamford Bridge, and he singled out the two centre-backs, Fikayo Tomori and Kurt Zouma, as not being ideal for the way the manager wants his side to play.</p>
      <p>“He’s definitely missing something. He went to Manchester United, everyone said Chelsea were the best team, played really well, got beat 4-0,” Scholes is quoted by the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/chelsea-paul-scholes-frank-lampard-frustration-man-city-centre-backs-11208939/">Metro</a>.</p>
      <p>“Played against Liverpool, played okay I don’t think they were anything great against Liverpool, got beat.</p>
      <p>“Played against Manchester City, everyone’s saying the best team, they were really good, they played well, they’ve lost the game. Now he has to find a way of changing that.</p>
      <p>“I’d be a little bit worried about his two centre-halves, the way he wants to play are they good enough on the ball?</p>
      <p>“I think defensively they’re okay but they look a bit nervous on the ball to me, which can create nerves throughout the team.”</p>
      <p>This seems a little harsh on the pair as they’ve largely done well in most games, but perhaps they are just short of being good enough in key moments against higher calibre opposition.</p>
      <p>Scholes also commented on that need to replace Eden Hazard in attack, which of course was made even harder due to the club’s transfer ban over the summer.</p>

      <p>He added: “Are they a centre-forward short? We know they’re missing Eden Hazard from last year, who’s a big difference we know that, he’s got the quality in these big games to win them.</p>
      <p>“[Lampard’s] got a really good team, but he’s got to find that way of winning in big games, and that will frustrate him for now.”</p>
