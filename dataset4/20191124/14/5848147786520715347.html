      <h1>Swimming: New backstroke queen falls just short of world record</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:42:24+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/laine-clark/" target="_blank">Laine Clark</a></address>
      <p>Australia’s new backstroke queen Minna Atherton has fallen just short of another short-course world record in the International Swimming League (ISL).</p>
      <p>Fresh from earning a huge World Cup pay cheque, Cate Campbell claimed the 50m freestyle for the London Roar as one of four Australian winners at the ISL’s London leg on Sunday (AEDT).</p>
      <p>But Roar teammate Atherton was the standout on the opening night of the star-studded two-day meet, claiming the 200m backstroke event just 0.02 of a second outside the world record.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old set a new Australian and Commonwealth record by clocking one minute, 59.25 seconds – the second-fastest time in short-course history.</p>
      <p>She backed up from her 200m heroics to also claim the 50m backstroke.</p>
      <p>Junior world champion Atherton is having a strong finish to a breakout year after denying veteran champion Emily Seebohm selection for the 2019 world titles in South Korea where she claimed three medals including 100m backstroke silver.</p>
      <p>At the last ISL meet in Budapest in October, she set a world 100m backstroke short-course record of 54.89.</p>
      <p>Seebohm, competing for European ISL outfit Energy Standard, was a distant third in Sunday’s 200m backstroke, clocking 2:03.65.</p>
      <p>A cashed-up Campbell showed no signs of slowing down in London after her stunning World Cup windfall.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was clearly still buzzing from claiming more than $400,000 from the just completed World Cup series.</p>
      <p>She picked up $A200,000 over the seven leg series before being awarded another $220,000 as the overall women’s World Cup champion.</p>
      <p>Campbell is now on track to cash in at the ISL after holding out Swedish champion Sarah Sjostrom by 0.04 of a second to win the 50m freestyle ISL title in London.</p>
      <p>Campbell is expected to earn more than $11,500 at the London leg.</p>
      <p>And if the Roar make the final at Las Vegas from December 20-21 – which features the top two European and US teams – $14,500 goes to each swimmer for the winning outfit.</p>
      <p>Other Australian winners on the ISL London leg’s opening night were Emma McKeon (100m butterfly) and Alex Graham (200m freestyle).</p>
      <p>Energy Standard (238 points) leads the ISL London leg after the opening night ahead of Roar (224pts), Aqua Centurions (178pts) and Iron (165pts).</p>
