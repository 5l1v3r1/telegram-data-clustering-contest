      <h1>Arab Terror Groups Announce Rage Tuesday over US Jewish Settlements’ Recognition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:17:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/di/" target="_blank">David Israel</a></address>
      <p>Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)-affiliated terror factions have called for a day of rage on Tuesday in protest against “the recent US announcement that Jewish settlements in occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank are not inconsistent with international law,” WAFA reported Sunday.</p>
      <p>In separate interviews with the official Voice of Palestine radio, faction spokespersons “called on Palestinians to participate in the protests, rejecting US-Israeli plots against the Palestinian cause,” WAFA reported.</p>
      <p>Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice president of Fatah movement, said that the movement and the national forces have set a program and a plan of action at all levels in the coming period, in order to escalate the process of confronting the “occupation” in light of the unprecedented violations, stressing that it can not at all continue this equation, Ma’an reported.</p>
      <p>Al-Alul said in an interview with “Voice of Palestine” that the US administration headed by Trump and the “occupation government” are “nothing but a group of gangs issuing and committing many crimes against our people, which amounted to murder.”</p>
      <p>Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
      <p>Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renounced a 1978 opinion written by the legal adviser of the Department of State Herbert J. Hansel (during the Carter administration), that said Jewish civilian settlements in the disputed territories are “inconsistent with international law.” (See: <a href="https://www.jewishpress.com/news/us-news/ap-us-to-declare-jewish-settlements-legal/2019/11/18/">AP: US to Declare Jewish Settlements Legal</a>).</p>
      <p>Many Arab and other officials from around the world have condemned the Pompeo declaration, saying it was a “threat to international system,” WAFA said, adding that “some thought it undermines achieving a last and just peace in the region.”</p>
      <p>Incidentally, so far the “international system” is not doing any worse than it had done before Pompeo’s announcement.</p>
      <p>The original Days of Rage demonstrations were a series of direct actions taken over a course of three days in October 1969 in Chicago, organized by the Weatherman faction of the counterculture-era group Students for a Democratic Society. 287 members of Weather were arrested during the Days of Rage and most of Weatherman and SDS’ leaders were jailed.</p>
