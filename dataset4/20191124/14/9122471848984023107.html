      <h1>Herm Edwards’ Postgame Interview Went Viral After Win vs. Oregon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:15:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Herm Edwards was fired up following Arizona State’s big upset win over Oregon on Saturday night. He had a right to be, after all, as his Sun Devils had just secured one of the most-surprising wins of the 2019 college football season.</p>
      <p>Arizona State dominated the game from the start and did not let up, beating Oregon, 31-28, to guarantee a bowl berth at 6-5 on the year. The Sun Devils shook up the College Football Playoff race, too, knocking the Ducks out.</p>
      <p>Edwards was interviewed on the field by ESPN’s Maria Taylor following the game.</p>
      <p>The interview has quickly gone viral.</p>
      <p>“We made it good for television,” the former ESPN employee told Taylor. “So even though you came to cover a 5-5 team, we made it good for television.”</p>

      <p>ESPN certainly won’t be arguing with that.</p>
      <p>There were a lot of skeptics surrounding Edwards’ hiring at Arizona State, but he’s done a respectable job so far. The Sun Devils are going bowling for the second year in a row under the former NFL head coach.</p>
