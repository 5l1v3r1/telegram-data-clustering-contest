      <p>She burst into tears when she found out she had to do it and Ant and Dec struggle to hold in their laughs as Jacqueline Jossa takes on I'm A Celebrity's latest terrifying Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>It would be fair to say that the ex-Eastenders actress has struggled a bit with the trials on this year's show and it was news of the latest one that reduced her to tears in front of millions of viewers.</p>
      <p>While the majority of each episode of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> is recorded footage, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant and Dec's</a> links are live as is the bit each day when they go into camp to reveal who the public have voted to take on the Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>And it was to reveal that she would be facing Sunday's trial alongside Ian Wright that prompted <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-jacqueline-jossa-crying-17307360">Jacqueline to cry</a> with her campmates rushing to console her as she could be heard saying "I don't want to do it anymore."</p>
      <p>The title of the trial - Crevis of Cruelty - is enough to put us off and the reality is just as gruesome as its name suggest as Ian and Jacqueline a series of underground tunnels and chambers for vital stars, as water rises around them.</p>
      <p>And if the confined space isn't bad enough, they are joined by all sorts of creepy crawlies with spiders, snakes and baby crocodiles among the critters in their path.</p>
      <p><i><b>As you can see in the above video from ITV,</b> </i>Ian and Jacqueline are left panic stricken by the challenge, Ian frantically trying to get to the stars as Jacqueline grows more and more impatient exclaiming "Keep going...I don't want to be in here!"</p>
      <p>To see all of the horrifying trial action unfold, tune into I'm A Celebrity on ITV at 9pm tonight.</p>
