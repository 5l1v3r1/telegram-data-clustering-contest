      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ambati-rayudu/">Ambati Rayudu</a>, in his follow-up to alleging corruption in Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), advised its president Mohammad Azharuddin on Sunday to not make it a personal tussle with him and isolate himself from “seasoned crooks”.</p>

      <p>Rayudu’s reaction came after Azharuddin claimed that Rayudu is a ‘frustrated’ cricketer. “He is a frustrated cricketer,” Azhar had been quoted as saying by PTI when asked about Rayudu’s claims of corruption.</p>
      <p>Seven months after his infamous “3D glasses” tweet, Rayudu had broken his Twitter silence on Saturday appealing Telangana’s Industry and Municipal Administration Minister, KT Rama Rao to look into the “rampant corruption prevailing in HCA.”</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old batsman also claimed afterwards that he had informed Azharuddin about the corrupt practices in the association but no action was taken.</p>
      <p>“I did have a talk with the president. He always said he was trying his best, but it never happened. I feel he should have initiated stronger measures but he did not do that. I feel there were more election promises and as a result, the game suffered. It hurt me a lot. A few players, who did not deserve to be in the team, were included in the team because of the election promises. If this happens, how can a team improve?,” Rayudu had said in an interview.</p>

      <p>After leading Hyderabad in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and being retained by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for upcoming Indian Premier League, Rayudu suddenly decided against taking part in Ranji Trophy, citing rampant corruption in HCA.</p>
      <p>Before that, Rayudu had announced his retirement from all forms of the game after not being selected for the World Cup, but he made his comeback in August. The veteran batsman has played 55 ODIs and 6 T20Is for India amassing 1694 and 42 respectively in the two formats.</p>
