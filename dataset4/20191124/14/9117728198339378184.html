        <b>At the age of 40, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a> is the oldest driver of the F1 grid. Having become a father and matured over the years the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/alfa-romeo-racing">Alfa Romeo</a> driver has realized that there are more important things in life than motor racing.  </b>

      <p><i>"My life has changed a lot because of the children,"</i> Raikkonen said to <a href="https://www.speedweek.com/formel1/news/152295/Kimi-Raeikkoenen-Racing-war-noch-nie-das-Wichtigste.html"><i>SpeedWeek.com</i></a>. <i>"If I was still alone, it would certainly be different. The children are responsible for change in many ways. And not every day is beautiful, but that is part of life. It's a lot harder, but you have a different center of life."</i></p>

      <p>Being a part of the Formula 1 circus is a true commitment. Raikkonen is used to spending a lot of time away from his family but it doesn't come without any struggle.</p>
      <p><i>"Sure, it takes a lot of time, and so it's a big part of my life, but it's just racing. It has never been the most important thing in my life," </i>said the 40-year-old.</p>
      <p>Raikkonen has a son who has started racing in karts and has admitted that it is hard seeing him race. </p>

        <i>"If you have children, you worry much more, which is not good, of course, but it's part of it. When our son sits in a kart, for example, I see many things, I know where the dangers lie. The kids do not think about it, they do not care, but you automatically start worrying." </i>
      </p>
      <p>Raikkonen is still enjoying his time in Formula 1 and perhaps it won't be long until Raikkonen junior follows in his father's footsteps! </p>
