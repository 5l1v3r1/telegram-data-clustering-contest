        <b>CRIMINALS across Scotland will be forced to support their victims to 'move on with their lives', according to Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new financial penalty will be imposed on crimes which take place as of Monday, seeking to make thugs contribute to the cost of supporting victims.</p>

      <p>It imposed on all offenders who are sentenced to pay a court fine, with the money going to the Victim Surcharge Fund.</p>
      <p>This fine will be levied on top of Scottish Court fines, and the money raised will be accessible by organisations who seek to help victims.</p>
      <p>Payments from the fund will begin being made in six to 12 months' time.</p>
      <p>According to the Scotsman, <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/crime/victims-of-crime-to-get-support-from-charge-on-criminals-fines-1-5003536">under the plan, victim surcharges would range from £10 on fines up to £200, to £350 on fines between £5,000.01 and £10,000, while court-ordered fines of more than £10,000 would incur a charge of £7.5 per cent of the fine.</a></p>
      <p>Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf stressed the importance of the victim in receiving support and aid to get back on their feet after an ordeal.</p>
      <p>He said: "Experiencing crime can be an isolating and frightening experience and we are committed to improving the experiences of victims in our justice system.</p>
      <p>"It's only right that criminals should pay towards helping victims to recover and move on with their lives.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The money raised through the surcharge will pay for practical support that will make a real difference to victims and their families.</p>
      <p>"While Scotland's long-term fall in crime means fewer people fall prey to criminals, we are continuing to invest £18 million annually to improve support, advice and information for victims.</p>
      <p>"This new fund will be a valuable addition to support available.</p>
      <p>"Over the coming year, we will also be carrying out further work to better understand where the gaps are in how Scotland supports victims and witnesses."</p>
      <p>The new policy was passed by the Scottish Parliament in early September.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats had raised concerns and outrage at the lengthy time it took to introduce the anew charges.</p>
