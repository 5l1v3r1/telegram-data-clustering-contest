      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has said the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> manifesto is a ‘partial blueprint’ for reuniting the UK.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Telford today, the Prime Minister said the Tories would ‘get <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> done’ by January 2020, insisting once more the withdrawal agreement is ‘precooked and ready to go’.</p>
      <p>He claimed the party would ‘restore confidence and certainty to businesses and families’, while focusing their ‘hearts and minds on the priorities of British people’.</p>
      <p>The audience heard how Boris would also ‘level up’ the UK through education, infrastructure and technology – as well as a points-based immigration system similar to Australia.</p>
      <p>He vowed to put 20,000 more police officers on the streets, as well as promising 50,000 new nurses and 50,000,000 GP appointments.</p>
      <p>This was followed by a promise that Scots and Northern Irish citizens would remain ‘passionate’ about their identities, while also being part of a ‘proud, strong and whole United Kingdom’.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister also dismissed rival parties during his speech, accusing them of keeping the UK ‘stuck in the same rut’.</p>

      <p>Making a dig at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, he joked: ‘He used to be indecisive, but now he’s not so sure’, causing the audience to laugh and issue a round of applause.</p>
      <p>Pledging to address climate change, he ended his speech by saying: ‘Let’s get carbon neutral by 2050 and Corbyn neutral by Christmas.’</p>
      <p>During questions, Boris lamented Corbyn’s plans to increase taxation on the top 5% of the country.</p>
      <p>He ranted: ‘If we want to make long-term funding commitments to the NHS, which we passionately do, we have to continue to run the economy sensibly and not go after wealth creators as if they are somehow enemies of this country.</p>
      <p>‘People who run businesses, people who get up early to get their shops ready, they are doing a fine thing. We should be supporting them.’</p>
