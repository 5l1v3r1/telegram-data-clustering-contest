      <p>Move over black and yellow, Janhvi Kapoor and Ananya Panday are here to mesmerize you in pretty pink outfits. The actresses were seen donning the little pink dress at different events and they pulled it off quite well.</p>
      <p>Let’s begin with Janhvi Kapoor- the actress chose a bright pink bodycon tube dress for Kartik Aaryan’s birthday bash a couple of days back. She chose to go for minimal accessories with just a multi-coloured bracelet. Janhvi rounded off her look with glittery silver pumps. Her makeup with shades of pink only added glitz to her hot outfit. We also loved how she kept her hair loose.</p>

      <p>Next, Ananya Panday was papped in the city this morning for promotions of her forthcoming flick Pati Patni Aur Woh. The actress looked super cute and sexy in a bubble gum pink-hued blazer mini dress. She had her hair tied in a ponytail and went for no accessories. Her black sandals completed her look.</p>

      <p>Well, we really can't say which actress looked better between the two in the cute little pink dress. We're spoilt for choice. What about you?<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- Viral Bhayani</i></p>
