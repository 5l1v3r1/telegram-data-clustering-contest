      <h1>Dean Smith's verdict on Steve Bruce, Newcastle United and Aston Villa injuries</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Dean Smith was back amongst the cameras as he looks ahead to Newcastle under the lights at Villa Park on Monday in the return to Premier League action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa are gearing up for the final Premier League game of the weekend - a home clash with Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's side are on a run of three straight defeats and are hovering just above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>The gaffer from Great Barr will have had to wait 15 days by the time Monday's game comes around following what was lacklustre showing last time out against rivals Wolves, Villa outplayed before going down 2-1.</p>
      <p>In his latest media conference, Smith opens up about a string of injuries which have plagued his 25-man squad while discussing the threats Steve Bruce and Newcastle pose as both sides return from the international break.</p>
      <p>Here's every word from Smith's Bodymoor briefing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How's the injury front and goalkeeping crisis?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Jed (Steer) unfortunately got injured in his first Premier League start for us. Against Wolves he got a partial tear of his Achilles so he’s going to be out for a while, which is a big disappointment because he was pivotal in us getting promoted last season and he’s been pushing Tom all the way.</p>
      <p>"Tom (Heaton) felt his calf against Liverpool and didn’t train but, in the build up to the Wolves game, we thought he might come through it but it was just too sore.</p>
      <p>"I had no doubts about giving Jed the start but unfortunately five minutes in his had to come off and Orjan Nyland ended up going in goal.</p>
      <p>"But Tom has been out on the grass today and he will be training tomorrow and Sunday, ready for the game on Monday.</p>
      <p>"I don’t have an idea about how long Jed is likely to be out – I’m guessing around about 3-4 months I would have thought.</p>
      <p>"It’s a disappointment but we are taking a conservative approach. It’s not surgical which is good news and hopefully we can get him back as soon as possible.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Jack Grealish has been training with us. I’m a little bit ill at ease to say he’s available because I’ve said it for the last couple of weeks and he’s not played – such has been his calf injury.</p>
      <p>"But he’s trained with us for the last week so I have no doubts he’ll be there and in his happy place at Villa Park playing in front of the fans.</p>
      <p>“Matt (Targett) came off just before half-time against Wolves with concussion and he went through protocol – he’s been back training now for the last week as well.</p>
      <p>"Bjorn Engels had an injection in his hip about 10 days ago and has been back in training, so I would expect them all fully fit and available for selection."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Has anybody come back with any problems from international duty?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"No. In all honesty, all the internationals have come back in a buoyant mood. We've got John McGinn who's been to Scotland and scored, what is it? Six goals his last three games for Scotland. He's bounced into the camp!</p>
      <p>"We've got two brand-new internationals now for Brazil, with Douglas Luiz and Wesley who've made their debuts. Trezeguet's played for Egypt. Conor Hourihane played for Ireland and they've all gone their minutes for their countries.</p>
      <p>"They're all fit and well and it was great to see them come back into the training ground today."</p>

      <p>
        <b>Expecting John McGinn to keep scoring?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We're hoping so, yeah. Hopefully he'll get a few now, he's hit the goal trail. He said to me if you need to throw me upfront, you can do!"</p>
      <p>
        <b>How has Jack Grealish been the last few weeks?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"He's been OK, frustrated with the injury, has been in a rich vein of form, nominated for October player of the month and, unfortunately, picked up a dead calf at the end of the game against Manchester City. Then he ended up missing Liverpool and Wolves which he thought he'd make both games but he didn't.</p>

      <p>"The fact he hasn't got called up, we've spoken at length about that. He can't control that but what he can control is he can keep performing, making sure he keeps the pressure on the people who have to make them decisions.</p>
      <p>"He's ready (for Newcastle). He's one of the fittest lads there, always doing extras after training as well. He's fit and ready."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How big is Newcastle at Villa Park for you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I think every game we play at Villa Park in this league is big. I said at the start of the season that home form is going to be the most important thing this season.</p>
      <p>"We've performed well so far at home. We were unfortunate against Liverpool in our last home game but, our last performance away, wasn't so good and the players certainly got a reminder of that.</p>
      <p>"Playing under the lights at Villa Park is always a great evening, especially with a full house and the fans fully behind us."</p>
      <p>
        <b>You reminded the players about the Wolves performance during the match. Have you reminded them again?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, we've done a de-brief about Wolves. We have picked out some things that we have to get better at, collectively, and the players know they have to do better individually. It just wasn't good enough in the first-half collectively. Second-half, we showed more but not enough to win that game."</p>
      <p>
        <b>It is Steve Bruce's return, so it does give it added spice?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, but we have played Steve before at Sheffield Wednesday last season. I said when I took the job I have an awful lot of respect for what he has done in management but, more importantly, for how he is as a man as well."</p>
      <p>
        <b>What about the job he's done at Newcastle so far?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"If you look at Newcastle at the start of the season, there were a lot of questions about the club and where it was going. But Steve has gone in and done what he does best – got them organised.</p>

      <p>"They've got pace and power up front. They are winning games – they've won the last couple – they beat Man United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where do you think their threats are?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"As I said, they've got pace and power up front.</p>
      <p>"They're a very good counter-attacking team as West Ham found out a few weeks ago. Three-nil up at half-time at West Ham is no mean feat.</p>
      <p>"They've paid an awful lot of money for Joelinton up front and they have two wide players who look to get in behind you as well."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think some of your players – such as Anwar El Ghazi – may have a point to prove with Steve as they didn't get much of a look-in when he was here?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I hope not. I want them to perform to the best of their ability. I don't want them to concentrate on anything."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How different can the atmosphere be at Villa Park on a night game?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It can be massive. The supporters have been integral to us being where we are in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"We don't lose many games at Villa Park and it took until the 94 minute for Liverpool to win and a couple of mistakes in our first game against Bournemouth but with the supporters behind us that's what I expect more of."</p>
