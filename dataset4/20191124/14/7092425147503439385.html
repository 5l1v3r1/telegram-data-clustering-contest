        <b>Last night's I'm a Celeb was a tough one for Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After choking on camel meat, the Dubliner was talking to James Haskell, the camp leader, and Jaqueline Jossa as the <a href="https://www.joe.ie/movies-tv/irish-comedian-andrew-maxwell-breaks-tears-im-celeb-687676">emotional</a> toll of I'm a Celeb started to hit him.</p>
      <p>"I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say 'have I done the right thing,'" Maxwell said.</p>
      <p>Jossa spoke words of encouragement, saying: "You can never leave, I can tell that you're just tired" before going on to say that he's spent six days sleeping on the floor and that he was just worn out.</p>

      <p>Haskell also offered a consoling hand as Maxwell started to cry, explaining that everyone has a bad day.</p>
      <p>"You're an important part of the group and we need you," Haskell said, with the former England Rugby star promising to keep an eye on him.</p>
      <p>"You're brilliant, you bring so much energy and laughter."</p>
      <p>Maxwell, speaking to the camera on the reality show, explained his feelings saying: "You know, it's those sort of things when you're tired and you get down, then all of the thoughts that you don't care about normally sort of get into your head."</p>
