        <b>Struggling Everton manager Marco Silva insists he is still the man for the job at Goodison Park but things are looking bleak as the team go into a horror run of fixtures on the back of losing to bottom side Norwich.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Canaries hadn't scored a goal on the road since the opening day of the season - ironically just across Stanley Park at Anfield - and they shocked the Goodison faithful with a 2-0 victory that prompted an angry reaction from the home fans that were left at the final whistle.</p>
      <p>The stats speak for themselves - just four points above the relegation zone after six defeats in nine league games sees a familiar situation brewing of discontent and disillusionment on the blue half of Merseyside.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>It's no real surprise, then, <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/sack-race-hotting-up/174386">to see Silva as the huge odds-on favourite to be sacked next </a></b>in the Premier League, as he gears up for a run of fixtures that contain games against Liverpool, Leicester (twice), Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City in their next nine.</p>
      <p>Majority owner Farhad Moshiri has pumped money into the club and is thought to be keen to find some sort of stability, but has already sacked Roberto Martinez, Ronald Koeman and Sam Allardyce for failing to fire Everton up the league.</p>
      <p>After hearing the crowd's reaction to the Norwich defeat, Silva said he respected Everton fans' right to react, but insisted he holds confidence that he can turn things around.</p>
      <p>"I respect all the reaction," said Silva. "But we have the confidence and we have to keep working hard to change because we came from good results before (three wins and a draw in the last five matches in all competitions).</p>

      <p>"We are trying to look for some consistency as a team and the last few results we did that but we didn't have the right performance to get the points.</p>
      <p>"We have to keep working hard and avoid the type of mistakes we made this.</p>
      <p>"If something goes against us in the game we have to show enough quality and be calm enough to take the right decisions.</p>
      <p>"It is just myself and the players on the pitch who can solve that.</p>
      <p>"My job is to analyse why this has happened again. I am concerned about what has happened on the pitch and what I can control is the situation and show my players why these things happened."</p>
