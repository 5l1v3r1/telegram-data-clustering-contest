      <h1>‘Investigation isn’t going to end’: Schiff says he’ll continue impeachment after filing report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:54:40+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>California Rep. Adam Schiff revealed that he would not stop investigating President Trump even after his committee’s impeachment report is filed.</p>
      <p>The House Intelligence Committee, which Schiff chairs, has started working on its impeachment report following testimonies from several witnesses. The report is supposed to include the findings of the committee to be presented to the House Judiciary Committee to move the impeachment process forward.</p>
      <p>Schiff, however, explained that he would continue to use the committee to investigate Trump on issues related to impeachment even after he hands off the Intelligence Committee report to Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler.</p>
      <p>During a Sunday interview on <i>State of the Union</i>, Schiff said that he would not wait to get a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pence-tells-house-committees-he-will-not-cooperate-with-democratic-led-impeachment-inquiry">court ruling demanding testimony</a> from several firsthand witnesses, including the depositions of Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Pompeo.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we would love to have the witnesses to come in, but we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out, to stall this proceeding when the facts are already overwhelming,” said Schiff. “We’re going to continue our investigation. We’re going to continue to pursue the documents.”</p>
      <p>Host Jake Tapper questioned Schiff’s statement, asking, “Even after you’ve handed in the report, you’re going to continue?”</p>
      <p>“Yes. Oh, yes,” Schiff said. “The investigation isn’t going to end.”</p>

      <p>Schiff, 59, could face his own investigation as many Republicans have <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-demands-schiff-testify-at-impeachment-hearings-along-with-whistleblower">called on him to testify</a></u> in the impeachment hearings because of his ties to the whistleblower. Republicans alleged that Schiff met with the whistleblower <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/schiff-knew-of-whistleblower-complaint-before-it-was-filed">prior to the report being filed</a></u>. He denies knowing the whistleblower but admitted an aide on his committee met with the person to provide "guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community."</p>
