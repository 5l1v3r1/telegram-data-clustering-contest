      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Mann Ki Baat radio programme on Sunday said that he never had the desire to enter politics but he now tries to put in his best efforts to serve the people, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/never-had-desire-to-enter-politics-says-pm-modi-1622170-2019-11-24">reports </a><i>India Today</i>.</p>
      <p>"I never had the desire to enter politics, but now that I am a part of it I give my best on how to work for the people," said PM Modi.</p>
      <p>He began the session with a special interaction with a few youngsters associated with the NCC, and as an NCC cadet in his school days, he never got punished.</p>
      <p>When one of the cadets asked him "had you not been a politician, what would you have been," Modi described it as a "difficult question".</p>
      <p>"Now this is a very difficult question because every child goes through multiple phases in life. Sometimes one wants to become this, sometimes one wants to become that, but it is true that I never had the desire to enter politics, nor I ever thought about it," he said.</p>
      <p>He said but now that he is a politician, "I keep thinking how I can work for the welfare of the country."</p>
      <p>He was also reported saying, "I used to read books. But these days I am unable to read and due to Google, the habit of reading has deteriorated because if you want to seek a reference, then you immediately find a shortcut. As is the case with everyone, certain habits of mine have also been spoilt."</p>
