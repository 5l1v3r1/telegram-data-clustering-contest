      <p>LONG ISLAND CITY, Queens (WABC) -- Police are investigating after a teenager was found dead on the train tracks at the Queensboro Plaza station in Long Island City.</p>
      <p>Police tell Eyewitness News they're investigating whether he had been surfing on a train.</p>
      <p>They say it's possible a fixed object struck him.</p>
      <p>The incident held up service for several hours. 7 and N trains ran on alternate tracks and were delayed.</p>
      <p>The victim's identity has not yet been released.</p>
      <p>"Surfing" subway trains, meaning lying on top, is illegal, and authorities consider it a common but dangerous activity that often involves youthful daredevils.</p>
