      <h1>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum Releases His New Top 6</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:59:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Paul Finebaum has updated his personal rankings following Week 13 of the 2019 regular season.</p>
      <p>The ESPN analyst has an SEC-heavy top five following Saturday’s slate of games. The only truly notable results were Ohio State’s big home win over Penn State and Oregon’s surprising upset loss to Arizona State.</p>
      <p>The race for the No. 4 spot in the College Football Playoff is getting more interesting by the day now that the Ducks are out. Could Alabama actually sneak back in? It’s very possible.</p>
      <p>Here’s Finebaum’s latest top six. He’s got Alabama up there pretty high…</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
      </ol>

      <p>LSU and Georgia will play in the SEC Championship game. The Tigers should win that one, eliminating the Bulldogs.</p>
      <p>The No. 4 spot could then come down to Utah, Alabama and Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Will the selection committee really take Utah or Oklahoma over an 11-1 Alabama team? We’ll find out in about two weeks.</p>
