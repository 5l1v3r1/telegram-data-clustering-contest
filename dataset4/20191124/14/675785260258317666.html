      <p>Zinedine Zidane has told Real Madrid fans to stop booing and start supporting Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>Wales international Bale was welcomed to the pitch by to a chorus of jeers from the Bernabeu stands as Real came from behind to beat Real Sociedad 3-1.</p>
      <p>Bale was sent on in the 67th minute with whistles ringing in his ears, following the latest country versus club row during the international break.</p>
      <p>After Willian Jose had given the visitors a second minute lead, Karim Benzema and Federico Valverde both netted to put Real in charge, before Bale set up Luka Modric with a deep cross to add a third.</p>

      <p>Bale had been criticised in Spain after being pictured celebrating Wales' Euro 2020 qualification victory over Hungary in midweek with a flag which read "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order".</p>
      <p>In response, Real fans waved a banner which read: "Rodrygo. Vini. Lucas. Bale. In that order".</p>
      <p>Zidane, who had called for a truce before the match, was not impressed with the reaction.</p>

      <p>"I hope this doesn't carry on for the rest of the season," Zidane said. "We want the fans to be with us from the beginning to the end, but we cannot control that.</p>
      <p>"The public has the right to do what they want, but I ask that they applaud everyone. I'm happy with the game and the victory and Bale came into the game well.</p>
      <p>"What you have to do is keep working on the pitch."</p>
      <p>Zidane added: "I have not spoken to him (about the jeers), I have only congratulated him.</p>
      <p>"I can't tell you if it's unfair or not. Everyone can say what they want. We need our fans, then we can't control what happens.</p>
      <p>"There is too much noise with Bale, he wants to be with us and do it well. That is why we don't want to talk so much.</p>
      <p>"He is integrated into the group and wants to play, just like everyone else."</p>
