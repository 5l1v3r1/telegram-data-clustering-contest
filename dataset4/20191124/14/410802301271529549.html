      <p>A small plane with 19 people on board has crashed in the eastern city of Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to local officials.</p>
      <p>The plane, operated by the local company Busy Bee, crashed during takeoff for a flight to the city of Beni, North Kivu Governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita’s office said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The crash is believed to have caused fatalities but the number of dead was not immediately clear.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 aircraft crashed into a residential area near Goma airport, AFP news agency reported.</p>
      <p>Heritier Said Mamadou, Busy Bee airline staff member, told AFP the plane was carrying 17 passengers and two crew members.</p>
      <p>“It took off around 9-9.10am (07:00 GMT),” Mamadou said.</p>
      <p>Air accidents are relatively frequent in the DRC because of lax safety standards and poor maintenance.</p>
      <p>All of the country’s commercial carriers, including Busy Bee, are prohibited from operating in the European Union.</p>
      <p>In October, a cargo plane also departing from the same airport crashed an hour after take-off, killing all eight passengers and crew.</p>
