      <p>Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella will undergo surgery to remove a fragment of cartilage in his knee, the Serie A club have confirmed.</p>
      <p>Barella was withdrawn on the stroke of half-time in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Torino and visibly indicated his pain to medical staff.</p>
      <p>In a statement on their official website, Inter revealed the 22-year-old has damaged a fragment of cartilage in his knee, which will require surgery to be removed. No timescale has been put on how long he will be out of action for.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, Inter boss Antonio Conte said: “I really hope Barella doesn’t have anything particularly serious.</p>
