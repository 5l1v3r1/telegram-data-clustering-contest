      <h1>Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher says he’s being retaliated against in war crimes case</h1>

      <p>Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher thanked President Trump for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/trump-says-navy-seal-edward-gallagher-wont-lose-commando-unit-pin/">intervening in his war crimes case</a> and said top brass in the elite commando unit are retaliating against him.</p>
      <p>“I’m overjoyed he stepped in again, being the leader he is,” Gallagher told “Fox &amp; Friends” during an interview on Sunday. “It’s all about retaliation.”</p>
      <p>Trump tweeted about Gallagher’s case last Thursday, declaring the SEAL’s trident pin would not be taken away.</p>
      <p>“The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197507542726909952">president posted</a>. “This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!”</p>
      <p>Gallagher was found not guilty last July of murdering an Islamic State militant while deployed to Iraq in 2017, but he was convicted of posing with the terrorist’s corpse.</p>
      <p>He was demoted from the rank of chief petty officer and could lose the Navy SEAL trident pin. Reports said Navy Secretary Richard Spencer would resign over Trump’s order not to review Gallagher’s case, but Spencer on Saturday denied the accounts.</p>
      <p>“I work at the pleasure of the president,” Spencer said during a security conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. “I do not interpret what the president does. I do what he says.”</p>
