      <h1>Hamilton 1, Rangers 3: Brave Hamilton fall to defeat by Rangers</h1>
      <h2>Accies had a good go at the Ibrox giants but couldn't take the points.</h2>

      <p>Brave Hamilton had a real go at Rangers but still fell to defeat at New Douglas Park on Sunday, as the Ibrox side kept pace with Premiership leaders Celtic.</p>
      <p>Accies can take a lot of heart from their performance as they tried to attack Rangers from the start, but they had very little to show for it in the end, apart from a fourth goal of the season for young Lewis Smith.</p>
      <p>Smith was one of two Academy graduates to sign a contract extension ahead of the game, with he and Jamie Hamilton staying until 2022.</p>
      <p>However, while it was the Glasgow giants who perhaps predictably took the points, Hamilton made it significantly harder for them than they usually find it.</p>
      <p>A fairly even first half saw Rangers edge into the lead by 2-1 at the interval, with a stunning strike by Ryan Kent cancelling out Lewis Smith's equaliser, after Ryan Jack had opened the scoring</p>
      <p>Rangers had dominated possession and had a few chances, but Hamilton had defended stoutly and had some opportunities of their own, too.</p>
      <p>In the second half the scoreboard remained troubled until Kent scored his second and Rangers' third inside stoppage time, but Mickel Miller certainly should have drawn Accies level, while sub George Oakley caused problems for Rangers.</p>
      <p>Accies head coach Brian Rice made four changes to the side that drew at Kilmarnock a fortnight ago. Luke Southwood made his debut in goal, replacing Owain Fon-Williams, while Aaron McGowan, Brian Easton and Marios Ogkmpoe all returned from injury, replacing Shaun Want, suspended Sam Stubbs and Oakley.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard made one change to the Rangers line-up which defeated Livingston last time out, as Jermaine Defoe came in for Alfredo Morelos up front. The English striker scored a hat-trick in a 5-0 win at Ibrox the last time the sides met.</p>
      <p>Rangers took the lead with their first real attack in seven minutes. James Tavernier found space on the right and when his cut-back wasn't cleared properly, Jack pounced to curl it into the bottom left corner.</p>
      <p>That was a bit harsh on Hamilton who had started quite well, but without testing Allan McGregor in the Rangers goal.</p>
      <p>Rangers nearly doubled their lead three minutes later when Kent went on a run but struck the left post with his shot, with Southwood at full stretch.</p>
      <p>Hamilton drew level in 14 minutes when good work by Ogkmpoe on the left took play into the box, Davies crossed from the right and amid confusion in the Rangers defence, Smith headed into the net.</p>

      <p>Rangers tried to get themselves back in front and in 26 minutes Jack forced a full-length save by Soutwood, who pushed his curling shot past the right post.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later Connor Goldson was free to head a Borna Barisic corner towards goal, but Southwood saved at the right post.</p>
      <p>Jack tried his luck from distance shortly afterwards, but his shot sailed over.</p>
      <p>Rangers had their best chance to regain the lead in 34 minutes when Jack slipped Tavernier in on goal, but Southwood came out well to smother the ball.</p>
      <p>It wasn't really a surprise, then, that Rangers did score again in 43 minutes when Kent found himself in a bit of space about 25 yards out, and unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top left corner.</p>

      <p>In the second half Hamilton tried to draw themselves level again and in 51 minutes Ogkmpoe was sent down the left, but he could only find the side-netting with his angled shot.</p>
      <p>That was the end of Ogkmpoe's chances and he was replaced by Oakley in 54 minutes.</p>
      <p>The English striker nearly made a quick impact, but Mickel Miller's cross from the left was too far ahead of him and he clipped a shot over at the right post.</p>
      <p>Accies should have gone level in 64 minutes when good play by Davies saw Oakley released down the left and he cut the ball back to Miller, who somehow put it past the right post from close range.</p>
      <p>Rangers went close in 76 minutes when Kent's free kick on the left was headed on an angle past the near post by Filip Helander.</p>
      <p>Allan McGregor kept his side ahead in 83 minutes with a rising save to deny Oakley's header from a McGowan cross from the right.</p>
      <p>But Kent sealed the points for Rangers three minutes into stoppage time as he buried a drive past Southwood.</p>
