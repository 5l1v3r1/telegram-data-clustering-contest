      <h1>Codeine poisonings halve at Brisbane hospital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:01:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Stone</a></address>
      <p>Codeine-related overdoses have more than halved at one of Brisbane's busiest hospitals since the drug was made prescription-only in February last year.</p>
      <p>Before then, drugs containing less than 30 milligrams of codeine did not require a prescription, but responding to a spike in the number of poisonings, the Therapeutic Goods Administration added all codeine-containing drugs to the prescription-only register.</p>

      <p>New research by the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane's southside on the number of poisonings presented there shows that in the 12 months before the ban, the hospital's toxicology unit saw 163 presentations for codeine poisoning. This compared with just 77 in the 12 months after the ban â€“ a 53 per cent decrease.</p>
      <p>The findings were published on Monday in the <i>Medical Journal of Australia</i> by lead author and Princess Alexandra Hospital toxicology specialist Dr Keith Harris and co-authors Andrew Jiang, Robert Knoeckel and Katherine Isoardi.</p>
      <p>"The decline in codeine-related presentations was not associated with a rise in alternative opioid-related presentations," the authors wrote.</p>
      <p>This was despite an overall rise of 13 per cent in the number of presentations to the PA for poisonings since the change, from 2235 to 2516.</p>
      <p>"Our study was limited by its single centre, retrospective design. Patients may have presented to other hospitals after codeine was rescheduled, but the total number of poisoning presentations to our unit was higher during the period after rescheduling," the authors wrote.</p>
      <p>About 90 per cent of the patients presenting to the hospital with poisoning during both periods, before and after the ban, were for paracetamol co-formulations.</p>
