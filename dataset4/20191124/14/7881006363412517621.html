      <p><b>Hong Kong</b>: Hong Kong voted in district council elections Sunday in a ballot the city's pro-democracy movement hoped would send a message to the Beijing-backed government.</p>
      <p>The run-up to Sunday's polls has seen a muting of major rallies and violent clashes between police and protesters, respite for a city battered by nearly six months of unprecedented political unrest.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Protest forums have urged citizens to vote and to pause acts of disruption in case the government pushes back the polls, which opened at 7:30 am (2330 GMT Saturday) for 4.1 million registered voters.</p>
      <p>Posts by pro-democracy users on the popular online board LiHKG urged supporters "not to jeopardise the election".</p>
      <p>The district council polls normally stir little excitement, dominated by candidates allied to the China-backed government with a remit over everyday tasks such as rubbish collections and planning decisions.</p>
      <p>But with protests roughing up the city, pro-democracy candidates are hoping to make a statement to Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the pro-Beijing government, which have refused to concede to the movement's demands.</p>
      <p>The poll to choose 452 councillors across 18 districts is the closest voters in Hong Kong get to direct representation -- but turnout is usually unremarkable.</p>
      <p>Nearly 400,000 new voters have registered, however, which is widely interpreted as a positive sign for the pro-democracy camp.</p>
      <p>Police were deployed at polling stations and on the city streets on Sunday to prevent any disruption.</p>
      <p>"If you create massive chaos or carry out unlawful deeds it will be difficult to hold a fair election," government Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It's a real democratic exercise. I really want people to treasure it."</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's political unrest started in June in opposition to an extradition bill to China.</p>
      <p>Although the bill was eventually withdrawn, the movement snowballed into wider calls for democracy and investigations into alleged police brutality.</p>
      <p>The district polls remain the city's freest. In contrast, members of the city's legislature are elected by a mix of the popular vote and industry groups stacked with Beijing loyalists.</p>
      <p>The city's chief executive is chosen by a similarly pro-establishment committee.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect pro-democracy candidates to make gains in the district councils, but to still fall well short of a majority of the 452 slots.</p>
      <p>In a bid to get out their vote, pro-democracy groups have made "HOW TO CAST A VOTE" airdrops.</p>
      <p>The messages urge young voters to turn up early, bring their ID and "avoid wearing black shirts and masks" -- the unofficial uniform of the protesters -- or accidentally spoiling ballots.</p>
