      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jadon-sancho/">Jadon Sancho</a>’s team has reiterated to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/borussia-dortmund/">Borussia Dortmund</a> he does not intend to push for a January transfer, reports say.</p>
      <p>The forward’s future is a hot topic at the moment, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> eager to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/manchester-united-optimistic-of-completing-185m-double-deal-for-jadon-sancho-and-erling-haaland-11177372/">make a formal offer for Sancho</a> in the winter window.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/">Athletic</a> claim the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/liverpool-firm-interest-jadon-sancho-aims-leave-borussia-dortmund-next-year-11147515/">building transfer speculation</a> prompted Dortmund to reach out to Sancho and his team again about his intentions in January.</p>
      <p>Sancho told Dortmund last summer he was not interested in switching clubs mid-way through the season.</p>

      <p>That stance was reiterated to Dortmund again while he was on international duty with England.</p>

      <p>Sancho’s plan is to stay at Dortmund for the entire campaign and decide on his future in the summer, despite feeling he has been ‘humiliated’ by his club in recent months.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was hooked from Dortmund’s game against Bayern Munich after 36 minutes before he left to link up with England this month.</p>
      <p>That humiliation followed the club’s decision to fine Sancho after he returned late from his previous spell at the England camp.</p>
      <p>Sancho feels he is being scapegoated by Dortmund, but the current tension has not changed his mind about a January switch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fc-barcelona/">Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liverpool-fc/">Liverpool</a>, United and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> are the four main contenders to sign Sancho next summer.</p>

      <p>The goalscorer is yet to indicate who out of the four clubs he would prefer to join.</p>
      <p>Despite the unrest at Dortmund, Sancho rescued his side from another dismal result against Paderborn last Friday.</p>
      <p>Sancho scored the goal which started a fightback from 3-0 down and then set Marco Reus up in injury time to grab an equaliser.</p>
