      <p>Megan McKenna is heading into the final as the hot favourite following a string of impressive performances – potentially handing victory to Louis Walsh as the last remaining act in his Unders category. ‘Megan’s home and hosed as far as the odds are concerned,’ said Ladbrokes Jessica O’Reilly of the reality star’s chances.</p>
      <h3>Max and Harvey</h3>

      <p>Odds of winning: 5/1</p>
      <p>Social media stars Max and Harvey are second favourites for the title – and could well emerge victorious after impressing the panel and audience with performances of such songs as One Direction’s Kiss You and Panic! At The Disco’s High Hopes</p>
      <h3>Jenny Ryan</h3>

      <p>Odds of winning: 6/1</p>
      <p>The Chase’s Jenny Ryan – aka The Vixen – almost didn’t make the live shows but was added in by Nicole Scherzinger at the last minute. Which turned out to be a good decision as she’s now in the final and third favourite to win it following epic performances of songs <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/26/x-factor-celebrity-sees-jenny-ryan-straight-safe-chair-fans-freak-chase-stars-return-10989858/">including Rise Like A Phoenix</a> and Skyfall.</p>
      <h3>V5</h3>

The girls – social media stars Alondra Martinez, Renata Vaca, Sofia Oliveira, Wendii Sarmiento, and Laura Buitrago – are currently the outsiders for the series title.</p>
