      <h2>She's heartbroken over the tragedy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rhea Turner</a></address>
      <p>A mum left devastated when her daughter gave birth to a stillborn son says she will never get over it.</p>
      <p>Lynn Barber was delighted when her daughter Francesca Arnold announced she was expecting a little boy.</p>
      <p>After a normal pregnancy, Francesca, who was 20 at the time, became overdue and Lynn escorted her to Burton Queen’s Hospital when she went into labour.</p>
      <p>But their excitement turned to horror when doctors revealed they could not find the baby’s heartbeat.</p>
      <p>Lynn, 55, said: "It was the worst thing you could ever imagine and to see the pain she was going through was a double-whammy.</p>
      <p>"The doctors said he died in the womb, but she still needed to deliver him.</p>
      <p>"Francesca <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/teenager-thought-stomach-bug-turned-3557328">didn’t understand what the doctors were telling her.</a> She didn't understand that he was really gone.</p>
      <p>"It was such a blur, but I had to keep positive for her through the labour. Watching her was so traumatic.</p>
      <p>"She was my little girl. My baby was losing her baby.</p>
      <p>"My eldest daughter was there too and she was a midwife on the ward at the time. We just kept looking at each other.</p>
      <p>"It didn’t sink in for Francesca; she just didn’t realise what was happening until he was bor,n but from the minute he was here we just knew."</p>

      <p>On May 14, 2011, Francesca gave birth to Franklynn at 2am. He weighed eight pounds and eight ounces.</p>
      <p>Lynn, from Melbourne, said: "He was beautiful.</p>
      <p>"The doctors took us to the Snowdrop Suite and we had our privacy. All the family came to meet him and they let us bath him and change him, we did everything you would do if you took a healthy baby home.</p>
      <p>"We were all heartbroken but without the suite it would have been even more awful. We needed that special time with Franklynn.</p>
      <p>"The staff were so caring and compassionate at what was a really tough time. Our hearts were breaking."</p>
      <p>Francesca, who is now 29 , <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/teenager-watched-dad-become-depressed-3562565">struggled to come to terms with Franklynn's death</a> and did not want to go home, which was full of baby equipment ready for their return.</p>
      <p>Lynn said: "She couldn’t bear it. We took her on holiday and while we were away I arranged for all the baby stuff to be taken from the house. It was too much to handle.</p>

      <p>"There was a funeral for him and everyone wore blue and yellow. She wanted it to be celebration of his life, of all the birthdays he would never have."</p>
      <p>Francesca, who now lives in Nottingham with her husband Robert and daughter Anise, six, has recently found out she is expecting another son, a thought which filled her with both happiness and worry.</p>
      <p>Lynn said: "She is pregnant again and any time her name comes up on my phone I burst into tears for fear.</p>
      <p>"I know she is beside herself with worry and because she is expecting a boy she is worried it will happen again.</p>
      <p>"We will love and remember Franklynn forever; he is a big part of our family.</p>
      <p>"But what happened will stay with us forever, even now I am still not over it."</p>
