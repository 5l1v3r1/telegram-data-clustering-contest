      <h1>Kennedy on Russia probe IG report: 'I'm not going to draw conclusions based on allegations by the anonymous source'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:38:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/zack-budryk" target="_blank">Zack Budryk</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.) on Sunday said he believed people within the FBI acted on their political beliefs in investigating <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s 2016 campaign amid reports that the Justice Department inspector general (IG) found no such bias.</p>
      <p>“I think the FBI is the premier law enforcement agency in all of human history. I also think there were a handful of men and women at the FBI and possibly in other agencies who in 2016 acted on their political beliefs both against President Trump and against Secretary [Hillary] Clinton,” Kennedy said on “Fox News Sunday.”</p>
      <p>“Whether that activity rose to some inappropriate level, I’m going to wait to read the report,” Kennedy added. “There’s this person running around Washington, D.C., Chris, by the name of anonymous source, and he keeps repeatedly getting quoted in articles. ... I’m not going to draw conclusions based on allegations by the anonymous source.”</p>
      <p>The IG <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/471727-doj-watchdog-expected-to-say-fbi-erred-but-absolve-top-leaders-of">reportedly found</a> that the probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia was not motivated by political bias or opened based on a dossier compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele, but it did find evidence of low-level misconduct, including an FBI lawyer who reportedly altered a document.</p>
      <p>Kennedy said, despite the reported conclusions, “I think any fair-minded American would look at” figures such as former FBI officials <a href="https://thehill.com/people/james-comey">James Comey</a>, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and “say there’s a real possibility they acted on their political beliefs.”</p>
