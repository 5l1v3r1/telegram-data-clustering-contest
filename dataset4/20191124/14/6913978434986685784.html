      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>JEDDAH — </b>Over 50,000 tourists have visited Saudi Arabia since the Kingdom eased visa regulations for visitors in September.<br/><br/>This figure is almost three times that number applied for tourist visas officials hope will diversify an oil-dependent economy, Al-Madina daily said in a report on Sunday.<br/><br/>British tourists, followed by Chinese, were the top visitors, Ahmed Al-Khateeb, chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH), has said. About 140,000 people requested tourist visas, he said.<br/><br/>The numbers are “in line with our expectations,” Al-Khateeb. “We are expecting that the adventurous will come first to explore the country, and this is what is happening,” Al-Khateeb was quoted as saying by the local media.<br/><br/>In September, the Kingdom launched a new system for tourist visa covering 49 countries including, among others, the US, the UK, Russia, China and Japan.<br/><br/>The Kingdom has asked foreign companies to invest in the tourist sector which is expected to contribute about 10 percent to the GDP by the year 2030.<br/><br/>Khateeb said the abaya (national Saudi dress for women) will not be compulsory for foreign women coming to the Kingdom as tourists.<br/><br/>“Women tourists, will however, have to wear modest clothes covering shoulders to knees even if they are on the sea shores," he said.<br/><br/>Khateeb said tourist visa is available on the Internet, through the Kingdom's diplomatic and consular missions and on arrival in the Kingdom at the fees of $120 including health insurance.<br/><br/>He said the tourist visa will enable tourists to stay for three months in the Kingdom and to visit all places.</p>
