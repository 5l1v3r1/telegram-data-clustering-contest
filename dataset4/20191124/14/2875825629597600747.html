      <h1>Riyad Mahrez explains Man City dressing room reaction to Liverpool beating Crystal Palace</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool took a 12-point lead over Man City when they beat Crystal Palace in the 3pm kick off, but Man City closed the gap back up by beating Chelsea at home</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:46:19+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez has revealed that his Manchester City teammates shrugged off Liverpool's victory over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>City's title rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> claimed a 12-point lead at the top of the Premier League after their late heroics at Palace secured a 2-1 victory - with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino netting for the Reds.</p>
      <p>That 3pm kick off victory put the pressure on Pep Guardiola's men to stay within touching distance of the runaway leaders - as they prepared for their evening kick off against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>But despite going behind in the 21st minute to a N'Golo Kante goal, Kevin De Bruyne and Mahrez both bagged to set the City back into winning ways - following their defeat to Liverpool before the international break.</p>

      <p>“We knew they had won, but we are built to win every game,” Mahrez explained.</p>
      <p>“If they win or lose, we try to win. It’s our mentality. We have to win anyway.</p>
      <p>“We don’t look too much at Liverpool. At some points last season they were ten points ahead of us, and we kept going.</p>
      <p>“We have to try to win every game, like we used to, and see how many points we have at the end.”</p>

      <p>De Bruyne believes <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> showed their champion qualities as they came from behind to claim a hard-fought win over Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The result saw City, who also hit the woodwork through Sergio Aguero and had a late Raheem Sterling goal disallowed by VAR for a marginal offside, leapfrog Chelsea to go third.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne said: "We work really hard and the main thing, when you lose a game, is to come back with a good reaction.</p>
      <p>"That's what we have always done over the last four or five years. I think it's very rare to see us lose two games in a row.</p>
      <p>"We work hard as a team and that's what we did. We have a lot of quality to make the difference."</p>
