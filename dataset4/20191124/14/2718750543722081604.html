      <p><i>Saturday Night Live </i>continued their coverage of the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-saturday-night-live-cold-open-with-jon-hamm-video.html#comments">Trump impeachment hearings</a> this week with their take on the Gordon Sondland testimony.

It’s the highlight of what, overall, amounted to a l<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/11/24/alec-baldwins-trump-meets-will-ferrells-sondland-snls-cold-open/">ackluster cold open</a>. Ferrell (in a bald cap) starred as Sondland, but there may have been some confusion over whose line came first, because Ferrell and Baldwin spend a full three seconds mumbling. Maybe it’s the bald cap, or maybe it’s the fact that these are two veteran <i>SNL </i>stars completely flubbing their lines, but it’s all weirdly endearing. <i>SNL </i>stars: They’re just like us!</p>
