      <h1>Leaked Renders Suggests What The Samsung Galaxy S11 Could Look Like</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:50:47+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>The hype-train for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S11 is still going strong. We previously reported on potential details of the new smartphone based on several reliable leaks, which included specifications on its <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198821/samsung-galaxy-s11-series-heres-what-we-know-so-far/">camera setup</a> and <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199934/samsung-galaxy-s11-receives-certification-may-include-5g-connectivity-25w-fast-charging-and-more/">fast charging capabilities</a>. This time around, we may have a rough idea of how the S11 might look like, based on renders uploaded to Twitter by known hardware leakster OnLeaks.</p>
      <p>OnLeaks has an impressive record of releasing near-accurate renders of leaked smartphones so far – including the recent <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-note-10-pro-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1081902300434780161?s=20">Apple iPhone 11</a>. Seeing that the final versions of these phones almost resembles the leaked renders, there’s a possibility that the actual Galaxy S11 may sport similar features that were created by the leakster.</p>
      <p>From the front of the phone, the renders allegedly depict the S11 to be somewhat similar to the recent Note 11, which sports a large display with small bezels and a top-centered punch hole for its front-facing camera. Three buttons consisting the volume rocker and lock button are located on the device’s left, while a USB-C port and speaker grille is seen on the bottom. However, its SIM tray slot isn’t visible, and – as expected – there are no 3.5mm headphone jack anywhere to be found.</p>

      <p>The rear profile suggests that the phone is equipped with five camera sensors arranged within a rectangular camera island. As previously reported, XDA and leakster IceUniverse suggests that the S11 cameras may include Samsung’s new 108MP sensor, as well as a 5x optical zoom capability which may be related to the “Space Zoom” camera feature that Samsung recently patented.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, these renders would go as far as to suggest to what the actual Samsung Galaxy S11 might look like. Given that the renders did not include a SIM tray slot on the phone could indicate that it may also be going for an <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199190/the-new-motorola-razr-only-supports-esim/">eSIM approach like the new Motorola Razr</a>, but it could also mean that OnLeaks may have forgotten to include it. So as per usual, always take these leaked information with a pinch of salt until we get an official reveal by Samsung.</p>
