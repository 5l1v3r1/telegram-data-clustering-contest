      <h1>U.S. Aircraft Carrier Conducts Military Drill After Encountering Iran's Navy While Entering the Gulf</h1>
      <h2>The Abraham Lincoln entered the vital Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday amid simmering tensions between Iran and the United States</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:50:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>U.S. aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln conducted training in the Arabian Sea on Saturday, to "maintain readiness" and "keep strong offensive capabilities," according to Commander Michael Boyle.</p>
      <p>The Abraham Lincoln entered the vital Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday amid simmering tensions between Iran and the United States as the strike group encountered the Iranian navy on its way into the Persian Gulf (Arabian Gulf), but all interactions were safe and professional, according to Commander Boyle.</p>
      <p>The Strait of Hormuz is considered the world's most important oil artery as about a fifth of the world's oil passes through, making it of utmost significance to the global oil market.</p>
      <p>Tensions in the Gulf have risen since attacks on oil tankers this summer, including off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and a major assault on energy facilities in Saudi Arabia. Washington has blamed Iran, which has denied orchestrating the attacks on global energy infrastructure.</p>

      <p>In response, the U.S. has deployed thousands of additional military forces to the Middle East, including bombers and air defense personnel to act as a deterrent against what Washington says is provocative Iranian behaviour.</p>
      <p>The latest move comes as protests, sparked by gasoline price hikes, have spread across Iran since last Friday, with demonstrators demanding that clerical leaders step down.</p>
