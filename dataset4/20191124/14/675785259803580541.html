      <h1>BREAKING Tory general election manifesto released confirming no-deal Brexit threat in 2020</h1>
      <h2>The document pledges not a day's delay to the implementation period beyond 31 December 2020 - prompting fears there'll be a no-deal Brexit if we don't get a trade deal in time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:01:40+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson today launched the Tory manifesto as he confirmed he will follow through on a threat to end the Brexit transition in 2020 - deal or no deal.</p>
      <p>The document pledges not to extend the implementation period for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> beyond December 2020.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> has said this before it is the first time it has appeared in black-and-white as a Tory manifesto pledge - binding a Conservative government.</p>
      <p>And it realises Remainers' worst fears that Britain could still crash out of the EU with no deal in a "trapdoor" on 31 December 2020 - even if Boris Johnson's deal passes.</p>
      <p>That is because the Tories' plan gives the new Prime Minister just 11 months to secure a full-blown trade deal with the EU.</p>
      <p>The manifesto claims: "We will start putting our deal through Parliament before Christmas and we will leave the European Union in January."</p>
      <p>And it claims the Tories will secure free trade agreements to cover 80% of UK trade within three years.</p>
