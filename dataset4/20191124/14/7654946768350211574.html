      <p><b>Carolina Panthers (+9¹/₂) over NEW ORLEANS SAINTS:</b> A lot of people have jumped off the Panthers’ bandwagon. They’ve lost three of their last four, including an embarrassing 29-3 loss to the lowly Falcons on Sunday, and Kyle Allen no longer looks like Carolina’s next Superman. However, I think they’re worth another shot, especially getting nearly double digits — and we’re waiting to see if we can get +10 by game day — against a Saints team that beat the Buccaneers 34-17 last week but were similarly whipped 26-9 by the Falcons just two weeks ago. I don’t see why the Panthers can’t stay within a touchdown.</p>
      <p><b>Jacksonville Jaguars (+3) over TENNESSEE TITANS:</b> These teams are pretty close to mirror images: reliance on the running game, defenses that step up at times, plus their records and stats. But I’m taking the Jaguars again as three-point divisional dogs even though the Colts blew them out, 33-13, last Sunday. That game got away from the Jags, and I expect a better effort from Nick Foles, who actually didn’t play badly in defeat. He went 33-for-47 (70 percent) for 296 yards and two touchdown passes to D.J. Chark (eight catches, 104 yards). I’m also encouraged by the Jaguars winning the earlier meeting 20-7 in Week 3, with Chark scoring a touchdown (from Gardner Minshew) while the “Sacksonville” defense took down Marcus Mariota nine times. The Titans’ offense has been better with Ryan Tannehill, but I don’t expect them to close the gap.</p>
      <p><b>Last week:</b> 2-0. Cardinals (W). Bengals (W).<br/><b>Season:</b> 10-12.</p>
