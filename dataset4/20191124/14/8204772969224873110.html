      <p>Racing photographer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pat+Healy">Pat Healy</a> was taken to hospital following a nasty incident after the line in the opening race at Navan.</p>
      <p>Thatsy and Entoucas fought out a thrilling finish to the www.navanracecourse.ie Maiden Hurdle, with the pair coming close together on the run to the line after negotiating the final hurdle.</p>
      <p>While Thatsy just edged in front to win, Entoucas appeared to crash through the inside railing just after the post – colliding with the photographer, who was stationed nearby.</p>
      <p>He was quickly tended to by medical staff – and while he was reported to be conscious, he was taken to Blanchardstown Hospital by ambulance for further examination, causing a delay to the following ‘Monksfield’ Novice Hurdle.</p>
      <p>The doctor on duty at the track, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Frank+Kenny">Frank Kenny</a>, said: “He left the course very stable and has injuries to the right side of his chest.”</p>
      <p>Entoucas and rider <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mark+Walsh">Mark Walsh</a> escaped serious injury, with the jockey reporting his mount had dived at the gap in the railing just after the line.</p>
