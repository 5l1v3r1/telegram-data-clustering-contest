      <h1>Report: Another NFL Team Has Interest In Hiring Jason Garrett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:53:50+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jason Garrett could be coaching in the NFC East in 2020 even if he’s fired by the Dallas Cowboys following the season. That’s what the latest report from NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport suggests, anyway.</p>
      <p>Garrett remains the Cowboys’ head coach and Jerry Jones would prefer to keep it that way. But Dallas, which leads the NFC East, might need to make a deep playoff run in order for that to happen. Garrett is in the final year of his contract.</p>
      <p>Another NFC East team would reportedly be interested in hiring Garrett if he gets fired in Dallas, though.</p>
      <p>The New York Giants might be the frontrunner to hire Garrett this offseason, assuming he’s fired by the Cowboys (and Pat Shurmur is let go in New York).</p>
      <p>“My understanding is the Giants have emerged as a real and legitimate potential landing spot for Garrett,” Rapoport said this morning. “First of all, it is his preferred destination if he can’t stick with the Cowboys. Second, back in 2014, the Giants were trying to decide, should they fire Tom Coughlin. My understanding is they would have fired Coughlin if they could get Jason Garrett. Instead, he signed an extension, the Giants kept Coughlin. We’ll keep watching this one.”</p>

      <p>A Cowboys-Giants game in 2020 with Jason Garrett as the head coach in New York would be fascinating to watch.</p>
      <p>For now, though, Dallas remains focused on a playoff push. The Cowboys will take on the Patriots in New England this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. E.T. on FOX.</p>
