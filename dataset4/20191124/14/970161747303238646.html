      <p>A van containing 100kg of cocaine has been stopped at a UK port.</p>
      <p>Border Force officers arrested James Satterley, 50, from Berkshire, after he allegedly tried to smuggle £10 million worth of drugs in a truck containing frozen fish.</p>
      <p>Officials stopped a van he had driven off a ferry at Newhaven Port in East Sussex, early on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>National Crime Agency (NCA) officers said they seized cocaine wrapped in 97 one-kilo packages hidden in a load of frozen seafood.</p>

      <p>An NCA spokesperson said: ‘If cut and sold at street level it is likely the haul would have had a potential value of around £10 million.’</p>
      <p>NCA Senior Investigating Officer Paul Morris added: ‘NCA officers are working alongside Border Force, Sussex Police, Thames Valley Police and the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit to investigate this seizure and the circumstances around it.</p>

      <p>‘Working with partners we are determined to do all we can to disrupt the organised crime groups involved in the large-scale importation of class A drugs, which fuel serious violence and impact some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Making seizures like this is an important part of that work.’</p>
