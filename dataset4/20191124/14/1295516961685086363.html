      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/jack-black-marvel-movies-cast-kingpin-thing/"><i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Black cited the Daredevil/Spider-Man villain, Kingpin, as a potential role he'd be interested in.

      <p>Most recently, Kingpin was played by Vincent D'Onofrio in the 2015 Netflix MCU show, <i>Daredevil</i>. Now that the Disney+ streaming service has been kicked off, <i>Daredevil</i>'s canon status in the MCU remains a mystery. Despite positive critical and fan reviews, the show was cancelled as Marvel moved platforms to Disney+ completely.</p>
      <p>As for the Fantastic Four, Fox adapted the property twice to varying degrees of success. Now that the Fantastic Four are back in Marvel's hands, MCU adaptations have been wildly circulating. Who knows, maybe Jack Black could get his wish one of these days.</p>
      <p><i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i> will hit theaters on Dec. 13. Jake Kasdan returns to direct the movie which stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Alex Wolff, Ser’Darius Blain, Madison Iseman and Morgan Turner.</p>
