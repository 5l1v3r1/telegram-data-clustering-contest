      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield have no shortage of unusual, entertaining new Pokémon designs. One of those designs is Applin, an odd apple Pokemon that evolves into a grass/dragon-type monster based on apple pie. Though Applin and its evolutions aren't too hard to obtain, there is a bit of a trick to it. Here's what you need to do if you're after the strange apple dragon creature.</p>
      <h3>Where do you capture Applin?</h3>
      <p>Applins aren't the most obvious Pokémon in the world, but they aren't hard to find. You can capture them on Route 5 in surprise encounters, or in either the Dusty Bowl in the Wild Area during sunny weather or the Giant Mirror and Stony Wilderness during storms.</p>
      <p>You'll want to evolve Applin right away, as Applin can only learn Astonish and Withdraw until it evolves.</p>
      <h3>How do I get Appletun in Sword or Flapple in Shield?</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, Flapple and Appletun are entirely exclusive; you can't evolve Applin into the Pokémon that doesn't belong in its version. You can, however, make friends with someone who has the opposite evolution and trade, or join a friend with the opposite version for a raid battle against whichever one you don't have. That's the only way to get the version not available in your game.</p>
      <h3>Can Flapple or Appletun Gigantamax?</h3>
      <p>Yes! But not if you catch an Applin and evolve it yourself. You'll need to encounter a Gigantamax Appletun or Flapple in the Wild Area and defeat it in a Raid Battle to obtain the Gigantamax version of either.</p>

        <li>Head to the far left side of the city, right <b>next to the exit onto Route 6</b> <i>Source: iMore</i></li>
        <li>Talk to the boy standing there. Give him your <b>Applin</b>. (Don't worry, he'll give it back).</li>
        <li>Watch the cutscene. Afterward, he will return your Applin, along with a <b>Tart Apple</b> in Pokémon Sword or a <b>Sweet Apple</b> in Pokémon Shield.</li>
        <li>Use the Tart Apple on Applin to evolve it into <b>Flapple</b> or the Sweet Apple to evolve it into <b>Appletun</b>. <i>Source: iMore</i></li>
        <li>If you want more of either Apple later to evolve more Applins, you can sometimes get the Apple exclusive to your version as a reward for defeating battle cafes.</li>
