      <p>TELFORD, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Sunday to get Brexit done to restore business confidence and unleash what he said would be a tidal wave of investment.</p>
      <p>“Get Brexit done,” Johnson said at the launch of his Conservative Party election manifesto. He said that leaving the EU would restore confidence for businesses and voters.</p>
      <p>“Get Brexit done and we shall see a pent up tidal wave of investment into this country. Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and our minds on the priorities of the British people.”</p>
