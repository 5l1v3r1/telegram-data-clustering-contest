      <p>Match of the Day X presenter Craig Mitch has found himself in more hot water after footage of emerged of him revealing his 'hatred' for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gary-lineker">Gary Lineker</a> .</p>
      <p>The broadcaster became embroiled in controversy earlier this month after a video from 2014 resurfaced in which Mitch referred to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bbc-presenter-craig-mitch-forced-20866468">Liverpool as a 's***hole</a> '.</p>
      <p>In the same clip from the YouTube show 'Filthy Fellas', Mitch can also be heard saying that people in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> 'still haven't got jobs', believing that to be the reason why the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">football team</a> could not get a result against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>And the presenter could find himself in more hot water with employers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> after more footage emerged of Mitch making fun of another city, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in his crosshairs this time around.</p>

      <p>Presenting a show for Spurred on in August 2015, Mitch is previewing Tottenham's trip to Leicester in the Premier League when he reveals his dislike for both Gary Lineker and Walker's Crips.</p>
      <p>"This week we have Leicester away at the King Power Stadium and that's a bit of a weird name because there is nothing royal about that club," says Mitch.</p>
      <p>"The best thing to come out of Leicester is Gary Lineker and Walker's Crisps, and I hate both of them but that's a whole other story and we'll get into that another time."</p>

      <p>The latest controversy is likely to cause more trouble for Mitch, with Lineker the host of Match of the Day and the broadcaster appearing on the spin-off show Match of the Day X.</p>
      <p>After the footage of him calling Liverpool a 's***hole' came to light, Mitch took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to issue an apology for his comments.</p>
      <p>However, the FA were believed to be considering their employment of Mitch for future engagements having used him on a freelance basis during last summer's World Cup.</p>
      <p>The BBC have declined to comment on the matter. Craig Mitch as also been approached for comment.</p>
