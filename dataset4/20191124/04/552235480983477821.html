      <h2>The proposal will be part of a series of measures aimed at improving ­corporate responsibility.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>A new law that would force big business to act in the social interest will be unveiled in the SNP’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/general-election">election manifesto</a> this week.</p>
      <p>The proposal will be part of a series of measures aimed at improving ­corporate responsibility.</p>
      <p>Drew Hendry, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> ­candidate for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: “It’s ­better for everyone when businesses choose to act responsibly.</p>
      <p>“But when firms fail to do the right thing, ­government should have the power to step in.</p>
      <p>“The SNP will put ­forward a package of measures that will make sure businesses work with the interests of their ­shareholders – many of whom will be the pension funds of workers – and wider society in mind.</p>
      <p>“SNP MPs have been at the forefront of holding the Tories to account – and in the next parliament, ­Scotland could hold the balance of power.</p>
      <p>“In that scenario, we’ll have real power to pursue our progressive and ­ambitious manifesto ­commitments.”</p>
      <p>Under the plans, ­company directors would have a legal responsibility to act in the interests of wider stakeholders as well as shareholders.</p>
      <p>Shareholders would also get more power to ­intervene and legislation to insure small businesses are paid on time.</p>
      <p>The party will also demand the “public ­interest to be fully ­protected” in any future sale of shares in RBS, which was effectively nationalised in 2008.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Greens’ manifesto, out tomorrow, will call for a law limiting the pay of chief executives to 10 times the salary of an average worker.</p>
      <p>The party will pledge to introduce controls on the public sector before rolling out the scheme across the private sector.</p>
      <p>Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: “Not only is the growth of wealth inequality a gross injustice, it is also ­devastating for our planet.”</p>
