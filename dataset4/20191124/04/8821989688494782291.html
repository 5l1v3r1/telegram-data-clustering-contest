      <h1>Watch Paul Stanley Answer Children’s Questions About Eric Carr</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:38:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:38</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Wilkening</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/paul-stanley/">Paul Stanley</a>'s Kiss Kruise bedtime stories event got unexpectedly serious and sweet earlier this month when a child asked about his memories of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/eric-carr/">Eric Carr</a>.</p>
      <p>Carr joined Kiss in 1980, and played on seven of their studio albums <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-drummer-eric-carr-died-twenty-years-ago-today/">before passing away Nov. 24, 1991</a> after a battle with heart cancer.</p>
      <p>You might wonder what <a href="https://www.filmratings.com/">MPAA rating</a> a pajama party hosted by the author of "Love Gun," "Keep Me Comin'" and "Let's Put the X in Sex" was aiming for, but this was a family-friendly gathering. Instead of recreating the "Uh! All Night" video, a fuzzy onesie-sporting Stanley shared Bugs Bunny cartoons with the audience before inviting children on stage for a Q&amp;A session and a quick book reading.</p>
      <p>The first question was actually just a compliment about his pajamas. The second got a lot deeper, as one of the kids asked about Stanley's memories of Carr.</p>
      <p>"Oh, big question," Stanley replied. "Well, when somebody who's close to you dies and passes away, it's horrible. You always think about what you could have said, what you could have done. It's just a big loss to lose somebody. Nobody can ever take anybody else's place. I miss him today. I was just talking about him yesterday.</p>
      <p>"But maybe that's how we keep people alive – by talking about them, and thinking about them," Stanley added. "When people die, we still have them in us, you know? Because we remember things they told us, and we remember things they may have said to encourage us, or funny things they did. So, in that way, people live on – they live on through us. So, yes I miss him but, you know, I have him in my life."</p>

      <p>Stanley wasn't out of the emotional woods quite yet, as the next child asked if he'd ever considered writing a song about Carr. "Hmmm ... no, I've never thought about doing that," Stanley said. "It would be tough, because I wouldn't want to write a sad song. I'd want to write a happy song. I'd rather write a song about the good things that somebody did when they were with me, rather than trying to write about them being gone. But I never thought about it."</p>
      <p>Kiss dedicated 1992's<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-revenge-turns-20/"><i> Revenge</i></a>, the first album they made after Carr's passing, to the drummer's memory. They closed out the record with a previously unreleased instrumental track named "Carr Jam 1981," which featured his only known studio-recorded drum solo.</p>
      <p>The next question changed the course of the conversation dramatically, and earned a rousing and tension-relieving laugh: "On another note, I was wondering about what shade of red lipstick you wear?"</p>
      <p>The answer: "Cheap!"</p>
      <h3>The Best Song From Every Kiss Album</h3>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/KISS-Debut-album-cover-web-optimised-820.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Kiss' (1974): "Deuce"</h4>
      <p>Gene Simmons says he wrote his first-ever Kiss song in half an hour, re-arranging the bass line from the Rolling Stones' "Bitch" to create a song that epitomizes early Kiss at their wonderfully crude and powerful best.</p>
      <p><b>Best Paul Stanley Song:</b> Just as "Duece" frequently opens Kiss concerts, the epic "Black Diamond" typically serves as their main set-closing number.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/kiss-hotter-than-hell-20160906062320.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Hotter Than Hell' (1974): "Comin' Home"</h4>
      <p>In the same manner Simmons celebrated the band's Stones influence on "Deuce," Stanley shows off their Beatles side with this catchy little toe-tapper, which somehow manages to be both jangling and fuzzy. "Comin' Home" also translates nicely to an acoustic setting, frequently serving as the opening song for the band's unplugged sets.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> The sinister "Watchin' You."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/KISS-Dressed-To-Kill-Album-Cover.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Dressed to Kill' (1975): "She"</h4>
      <p>Wisely stripping the flute (!) and congas from a song by Kiss' predecessor Wicked Lester, Simmons ends up with a throbbing, hypnotic gem that also served as the launching pad for some of the band's best extended live instrumental work.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley Song:</b> With an assist from co-writer Ace Frehley, it's "Rock Bottom" – and as with most songs on their first three albums, to get the full effect check out the 'Alive!' version.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/kiss-sweet-pain-casablanca-5.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Destroyer' (1976): "Shout It Out Loud"</h4>
      <p>While 'Destroyer' may have been a hair too polished and poppy for the band's hard-earned live following, there was no denying the marked improvement in overall songwriting. Their collaboration with producer (and studio taskmaster) Bob Ezrin paid particularly high dividends with the rousing "Shout It Out Loud," which finds Simmons and Stanley sharing both songwriting and lead vocal duties.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley and Simmons "Solo" Songs:</b> "Do You Love Me" and "God of Thunder."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/RNRO.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Rock and Roll Over' (1976): "I Want You"</h4>
      <p>Released just eight months after 'Destroyer,' 'Rock and Roll Over' found Kiss removing some of Ezrin's studio polish while continuing to explore more sophisticated riffs and dynamics. Stanley delivers an especially dramatic vocal performance on "I Want You," and also shares lead guitar duties with Frehley. Naturally, the 'Alive II' version found him pushing things to even more delirious heights, with an extended song-ending call and response segment.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> "Calling Dr. Love."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/kisslovegunsingle.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Love Gun' (1977): "Love Gun"</h4>
      <p>Just the title alone almost seals the deal. Can you imagine that phone call to the label? "So, what's the new Kiss album gonna be called, guys?" Happily, in addition to pushing the band's disregard for lyrical subtlety to new heights, Stanley also delivers an all-time classic here. Peter Criss' repeated cadence gets all the attention, but Frehley's solo work takes the whole song to another level.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> "Almost Human."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/kiss-alive-ii-front.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Alive II' (1977): "Larger Than Life"</h4>
      <p>Not wanting to repeat any songs from the barely two years-old 'Alive!,' Kiss found themselves with an empty album side to fill with new studio material. The band was starting to fracture at this point, leading to a "White Album"-type approach with Stanley, Frehley and Simmons all basically doing songs on their own. They all do very well, but Simmons' braggadocious "Larger Than Life" edges out the victory.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley Song:</b> "All American Man."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/sureknowsomething.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Dynasty' (1979): "Sure Know Something"</h4>
      <p>"I Was Made for Lovin' You" got all the chart glory – and even more old-school fan backlash – but Stanley's bittersweet "Sure Know Something" is the more assured, timeless take on disco-rock.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons, Frehley Songs:</b> After the success of his 1978 solo album surpassed those of his bandmates, Frehley commanded multiple lead vocals this time out, the best being "Hard Times." The Demon seems to have largely gone into hiding, but if forced to choose ... uh, "Charisma?"</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/KISS_Unmasked_etu.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Unmasked' (1980): "Tomorrow"</h4>
      <p>Hardly anybody cared by this point, but a slight shift from disco-rock to Raspberries-inspired power pop made for a world of improvement on this highly underrated album. Stanley in particular takes to this new setting like a fish to water, especially on the infectious shoulda-been-a-smash "Tomorrow."</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons, Frehley Songs:</b> The awesomely loopy "Torpedo Girl" gets the nod over the more grounded "Talk to Me" for the Spaceman. Simmons understandably struggled presenting a sense of menace in this musical setting, but at least delivers a few chuckles with "She's So European."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/EldCV.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Music From The Elder' (1981): "Mr. Blackwell"</h4>
      <p>Oh boy. Initially fully intending to return to familiar hard-rock territory, Kiss instead let themselves get led astray into proggy concept album territory on their most reviled album to date. The thing is, there's places where this extremely odd mash-up works – particularly on the cinematic, foreboding "Mr. Blackwell." Most importantly, Simmons seems to have found the lost key to his Demon persona.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley, Frehley Songs:</b> Frehley largely sat out his last album with Kiss, literally mailing in just one song, the (perfectly cool) guitar showcase "Dark Light." Sharing the microphone with Simmons, Stanley delivers his best performance on the upbeat self-appreciation anthem "I."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/Kiss_Killers.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Killers' (1982): "Nowhere to Run"</h4>
      <p>After sending themselves to the corner to think about what they'd done wrong on recent albums, Kiss (well, largely Stanley, who takes all the lead vocals) teamed up with outside songwriters and turned in four solid, straight-ahead hard rock songs for an overseas best-of compilation. As you can guess by their song titles, "I'm a Legend Tonight" and "Down on Your Knees" find the Starchild successfully regaining his lustful swagger, but "Nowhere to Hide" offers more texture and range.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/Creatures.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Creatures of the Night' (1982): "Saint and Sinner"</h4>
      <p>NOW we're talking. It would take two more albums to fully pull themselves out of commercial purgatory, but creatively Kiss was on fire here. A pair of Simmons' best 'Creatures' songs address the real-life narrative of the band's recent struggles – perversely making this a better concept album than 'The Elder' all by themselves. "Saint and Sinner" (an unrepentant indictment of and farewell to the departed Frehley) is the highlight. But the myth-busting "Rock and Roll Hell" is close behind – and was so good Frehley himself covered it decades later.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley Song:</b>: "I Still Love You" or "Keep Me Comin'" – depending on if you're voting with your heart or your groin.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/kiss-lick-it-up-casablanca-5.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Lick It Up' (1983): "Lick It Up"</h4>
      <p>Maybe Vinnie Vincent didn't save Kiss, but he sure showed up at exactly the right moment to help them solidify their comeback. He co-wrote 8 of this album's 10 songs with Simmons and / or Stanley. That includes the undeniable title track, which has surpassed the initially more successful "Heaven's on Fire" to become the defining '80s Kiss song – and one of the most reliable highlights of their live set.</p>
      <p><b>Best SImmons Song:</b> "Dance All Over Your Face."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/HOF.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Animalize' (1984): "Heaven's On Fire"</h4>
      <p>Just two years after having to scuttle their 10th anniversary tour early due to poor attendance, Kiss cemented their return by hitting No. 11 on the singles charts with the insanely catchy "Heaven's on Fire," which opens with Stanley vocally peacocking to great effect.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> "Runaway," with Tom Selleck.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/Asylum.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Asylum' (1985): "Radar for Love"</h4>
      <p>"Tears Are Falling" kept Kiss' commercial winning streak going, but new recruit Bruce Kulick gets to shine brightest on the Zeppelin-inspired "Radar for Love," which wisely devotes the full back half of its running time to instrumental vamping reminiscent of the live "Let Me Go, Rock and Roll."</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> "Any Way You Slice It."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/kiss-turn-on-the-night-vertigo.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Crazy Nights' (1987): 'Turn On the Night"</h4>
      <p>Although Kiss' brief visit to the world of keyboard-heavy pop metal wasn't all that inspiring overall, the huge catchy chorus of "Turn On the Night" found them pulling off the look with relative aplomb.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> Another Kulick victory, really, as the guitarist gets to shine with an extended solo piece that leads into the album's one distorted balls-out rocker, "No, No, No."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/Rise.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Hot in the Shade (1989): "Rise to It"</h4>
      <p>A partially successful attempt at shaking off all the hairspray that had suddenly gunked up their image and sound, 'Hot in the Shade' is admirably stripped down, but overlong and underbaked. Ultimately, the propulsive lead track "Rise To It" promises more than the band was able to deliver on the majority of this album.</p>
      <p><b>Best Eric Carr Track:</b> The band's beloved longtime drummer finally got to take lead vocals on the rousing "Little Caesar," an accomplishment that took on an unexpected poignancy with his death two years later.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/Kiss_revenge_cover.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Revenge' (1992): "Spit"</h4>
      <p>Ten years after their last masterpiece, Kiss once again made a stunning return to form with the highly focused 'Revenge." In a "hey, whatever works" development, a goatee and a long leather coat seemed to help Simmons once again regain prime form for the first time in nearly a decade. The irreverent, stop-start "Spit" is the best among many highlights here. It's a group victory, really, with Stanley gleefully quoting Spinal Tap as scripture and Kulick using big chunks of our actual National Anthem for his guitar solo.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley Song:</b> The amped-up "Summertime Blues" re-write "I Just Wanna."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/COS.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Carnival of Souls' (1997): "In My Head"</h4>
      <p>A pattern begins to emerge here: As soon as Kiss find their natural footing, they tend to abandon it in pursuit of the latest big trend. In this case, humorless grunge rock. 'Carnival of Souls' was shelved as result of the band's original lineup reunion, largely ignored upon its eventual release, and then openly panned by Stanley in later years. Still, there's some fun to be had. Unlike 'Unmasked,' this time the setting more naturally suits Simmons and he delivers a handful of keepers led by the rifftastic "In My Head."</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley Song:</b> "Master &amp; Slave."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/SharedImage-44726.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Psycho Circus' (1998): "Within"</h4>
      <p>It wasn't a true reunion: Frehley and Criss were basically relegated to one solo and one shared track each. Even so, 'Psycho Circus' is more fun (and more successfully diverse) than you've likely been lead to believe. Although it isn't exactly representative of the album's overall celebratory vibe, Simmons' brooding, near-psychedelic "Within" gets the crown here.</p>
      <p><b>Best Stanley Song:</b> The gloriously and perfectly titled "I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock &amp; Roll."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/KISS_MODERN-DAY-DELILAH-486245.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Sonic Boom' (2009): "Modern Day Delilah"</h4>
      <p>After a career-longest 11 year absence from record stores, Kiss returned with the first of two well-received back-to-basics efforts. It's all at least pretty good, but the opening "Modern Day Delilah" shone brightest by far. With one of the best main riffs and almost inarguably the best guitar solo the band's delivered on record in ages, it's a shame "Modern Day Delilah" didn't earn a permanent place in their set lists.</p>
      <p><b>Best Simmons Song:</b> The charmingly retro "Yes I Know (Nobody's Perfect)."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/11/Monster.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Monster' (2012): "Take Me Down Below"</h4>
      <p>Sounding looser than they have in decades, Kiss get their AC/DC on with an absolutely swaggering main riff – and then up the ante by having Simmons and Stanley attempt to out-duel each other with naughty nautical puns. A few more just like this before you leave us for good, please!</p>
