      <p>The mother of two toddlers who died after being left in a burning hot car south of Brisbane has been charged with their murders.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old woman will face Brisbane Magistrates court on Monday charged over the deaths of the one-year-old and two-year-old girls at Waterford West in Logan.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said the sisters died from exposure to extreme heat, with the temperature reaching 31 degrees when they were discovered.</p>
      <p>Police remain at the home and are putting together a timeline to establish how long they had been in a black station wagon parked across the property’s front yard.</p>
      <p>Paramedics were called there about 1.35pm on Saturday but were unable to revive the little girls.</p>
      <p>“The two children exhibited signs of being exposed to extreme heat and that is forming the direction of our investigation,” Detective Inspector Mark White said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very tragic incident which has occurred.”</p>
      <p>Police said they were offering support to officers who attended the scene.</p>
      <p>“We are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our people,” Detective Inspector White said.</p>
      <p>“One of our priorities in addition to conducting the investigation is the wellbeing of our staff and our other emergency service colleagues.”</p>
