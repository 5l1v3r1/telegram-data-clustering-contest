      <p>Football can be a game full of excuses – but the one that caused a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-junior-football-association">Scottish Junior Cup</a> clash to be called off is surely a first.</p>
      <p>The tie between Bridge of Don Thistle and Fauldhouse United was cancelled after foxes allegedly dug holes all over the pitch.</p>
      <p>A local referee decided on Friday night that the park at Aberdeen Sports Village was too dangerous to play on.</p>
      <p>But Fauldhouse officials last night claimed there was not a blade of truth in the excuse.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-lothian">West Lothian</a> club insisted the real reason behind the call-off was that Bridge of Don players wanted to go on a stag do.</p>
      <p>United chairman Steven Sharpe, who was in Aberdeen on business, checked the pitch yesterday morning and said it was in “pristine” condition.</p>
      <p>Last night, Fauldhouse manager Jon Connolly described the call-off as “an absolute farce”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Bridge of Don didn’t even bother to contact us, so we had to find out from the Scottish Junior Football Association.</p>
      <p>“It looks as if the referee, whoever it is, has done them a favour because there are rumours of a stag do going around, which means that they’ll have players missing, so they’re trying to play the game when it suits them.</p>
      <p>“My chairman went to check the pitch this morning and it’s absolutely fine.”</p>
      <p>Bridge of Don Thistle, co-managed by Lewis Muirhead and Thomas Wilson, were unavailable for comment last night.</p>
