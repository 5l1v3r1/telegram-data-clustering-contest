      <h1>Taylor runs wild as No. 12 Wisconsin defeats Purdue</h1>

      <p>Jonathan Taylor rushed for 222 yards on 28 carries to lead No. 12 Wisconsin to a 45-24 win against Purdue in a Big Ten West division matchup Saturday in Madison, Wis.</p>
      <p>Taylor scored one touchdown and fumbled twice. The performance marked the junior’s 12th career 200-yard rushing performance.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Jack Coan completed 15 of 19 passes for 203 yards and two scores for the Badgers (9-2, 6-2). He had one interception.</p>
      <p>Aidan O’Connell completed 26 of 43 passes for a career-high 289 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for Purdue (4-7, 3-5). Brycen Hopkins had eight catches for 127 yards and two touchdowns and David Bell had 12 receptions for 108 yards and one score for Purdue.</p>
      <p>Taylor rushed for a 51-yard score with 1:30 left in the first quarter — his 22nd touchdown of the season — to put Wisconsin ahead 14-3.</p>
      <p>A standout on Wisconsin’s senior day was senior kicker Zach Hintze, who drilled a 62-yard field goal to break a school record and extend the Badgers’ lead to 24-17 as time expired in the first half.</p>
      <p>Hintze surpassed the 60-yard field goal made by Badgers kicker John Hall on Nov. 11, 1995.</p>
      <p>Purdue capitalized off a Badgers’ turnover to take its only lead of the game. Boilermakers defensive end George Karlaftis forced a fumble of Wisconsin wide receiver A.J. Taylor, which was recovered by Purdue safety Navon Mosley.</p>
      <p>Hopkins, the tight end, posted his second score, a 37-yard touchdown catch from Milton Wright with 8:30 to go in the second quarter to lift Purdue to a 17-14 lead.</p>
      <p>The Badgers countered with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Coan to Jack Dunn with 4:18 to go in the second quarter, as Wisconsin regained the lead at 21-17.</p>
      <p>Coan’s 29-yard touchdown pass to Quintez Cephus padded Wisconsin’s lead at 38-17 with two minutes remaining in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The Badgers, who won their 14th straight game against the Boilermakers, persevered despite four turnovers.</p>
      <p>The Badgers are one game behind Minnesota in the West Division standings. The two teams will meet in the regular-season finale at TCF Stadium in Minneapolis on Nov. 30, with the winner taking on Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship on Dec. 7.</p>
