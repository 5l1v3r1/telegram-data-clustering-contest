      <h1>Charles Schwab-TD Ameritrade deal would show fallacy of ‘free’ trade</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:57:29+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:57</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathon Trugman</a></address>
      <p>Just weeks after Charles Schwab turned the industry upside down by cutting online stock trading commissions to zero, word broke Thursday that it is in discussions to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/charles-schwab-eyes-purchase-of-td-ameritrade-reports/">acquire rival TD Ameritrade</a> for $26 billion.</p>
      <p>If the deal to merge the country’s two largest discount brokerages goes through, the resulting behemoth will essentially dominate the “free” trading space — and make for a profitable powerhouse to compete with the big boys on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>But why would any company want to expand in a field that offers its product for free? Simple: because it’s not really free!</p>
      <p>While you may pay zero on a stock or ETF trade, the broker bundles your trades with others — then sells the order flow and collects rebates. That’s where the real money is.</p>
      <p>On the institutional side, rebates have been captured for years and credited to the corresponding fund via the exchanges directly. The interest rate spreads on cash and margin balances are extremely lucrative, as well.</p>
      <p>And while it’s good that individuals can trade for zero commissions, the fact is the track record for individuals picking and trading stocks on their own is dismal.</p>
      <p>A quick glance at Schwab’s 2018 revenues shows that only 7% of the firm’s revenue came from trading last year — and 88% came from interest rate spreads and asset management and service fees combined.</p>
      <p>And those fees are not getting cut, yet. Sadly, if the merger goes through the likely additional “cuts” will be thousands of redundant back-office jobs.</p>
      <p>Depending on how the Democratic primary shakes out, there may be yet another financial firm for Schwab to buy: Bloomberg LP. And if candidate Michael Bloomberg sells to avoid a conflict of interest, it could even be tax free!</p>
