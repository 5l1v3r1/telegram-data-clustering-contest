      <p>The presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Days Saints, Elder Patrick Kearon, has described Christians in Nigeria and West Africa sub-region as loving people that Christians of other countries of the world should borrow a leaf from.</p>
      <p>Kearon stated this recently in Lagos during a Special Lagos Nigeria Agege Stake Conference of the church.</p>
      <p>The cleric called on Christians at this trying period to imbibe the teaching of Christ on love for God and for their fellow humans with humble and righteous minds.</p>
      <p>The cleric said though coming to Nigeria and West Africa for the first time may not qualify him to comment on general issues about the region, he noted that Christianity is alive and vibrant in the region.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the rationale behind the church’s conference in Nigeria, the clergyman said the idea is to bring people closer to Jesus Christ and to give them a clearer understanding that they are loving children of their heavenly Father and to also remind them that they are here for a shortest time.</p>
      <p>“Christians in West Africa are quite loving people and they are point of reference and emulation to other Christians in the world.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on the border closure by the federal government, the Agege Stake President of the church, Asuquo Udobong, explained that every government has policy to pursue to achieve success while on the seat of power.</p>
      <p>He said as a church, they throw their weight behind government if they feel border closure is a round peg in a round hole policy for the growth and strengthening of Nigeria’s economy.</p>
      <p>“Statistically, I may not have data to measure the impact of that policy on people and am not sure even the government knows the impact on the citizens for now apart from hearsay, but over time I believe they would be able to give us correct data whether there is positive impact or not. And whatever that happens, all we need is that things are doing well and the country is safe for us all,” Udobong submitted.</p>
