      <p>LeBron James posted 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers edged the Memphis Grizzlies, while Giannis Antetokounmpo inspired the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA.</p>
      <p>James scored on a driving layup with less than two minutes remaining to lead the Lakers past the Grizzlies 109-108 in Memphis on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Anthony Davis added 22 points as the high-flying Lakers (14-2) extended their winning streak to seven games.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies (5-10) were led by rookie Ja Morant's 26 points, while Jae Crowder had 21 of his own.</p>
      <p>Reigning MVP Antetokounmpo and his double-double fuelled the Bucks' 104-90 win against the Detroit Pistons.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo finished with 28 points and 10 rebounds for his 16th consecutive double-double.</p>
      <p>The Bucks star became the first player to open the season with 16 straight double-doubles since Moses Malone in 1981.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aldridge helps end slump</b>
      </p>
      <p>LaMarcus Aldridge had 23 points as the San Antonio Spurs snapped an eight-game losing streak by topping the New York Knicks 111-104.</p>
      <p>Josh Richardson scored 32 points and Joel Embiid contributed 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Philadelphia 76ers, who crushed the Miami Heat 113-86.</p>
      <p>A 34-point haul from Pascal Siakam helped the Toronto Raptors to a 119-116 win at the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
      <p>Donovan Mitchell's 37 points keyed the Utah Jazz's 128-120 victory against the New Orleans Pelicans, who were led by Brandon Ingram's 33 points.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Butler endures rough return to Philly</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a tough night for Jimmy Butler. Back in Philadelphia following his trade to the Heat in the offseason, the former 76ers star – who was booed every time he touched the ball – managed just 11 points. Butler missed nine of 13 field goal attempts as he sat out the entire fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LaVine completes incredible comeback</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zach LaVine had a franchise-record 13 three-pointers, including this game-winning three with 0.8 seconds remaining. LaVine finished with a career-high 49 points as the Chicago Bulls stunned the Charlotte Hornets 116-115.</p>
