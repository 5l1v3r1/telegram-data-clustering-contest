      <p>“You don’t tell lies.” It’s one of the first, simplest things we try to teach our children.</p>
      <p>And anyone who has kids will be familiar with the routine of them getting busted in a lie: The denials followed by anger as they realise they’re cornered, followed by silence as they sit there stony-faced, failing to make eye contact with you, shamed.</p>
      <p>Of course, when it comes to lying, adulthood brings many shades of grey into the equation.</p>
      <p>There’s the little white lies told to spare feelings. (“Mmmm. This cake/curry/casserole you’ve made is delicious!” When, in reality it tastes like concrete/feet/soil).</p>
      <p>There are the minor lies we use when we just can’t face telling the truth. (“Oh, I really wanted to come to your party but I came down with the flu.” When what you really meant was: “It was pouring down with rain and there was this box set that I fancied starting.”)</p>
      <p>And then, for some, there are the much bigger whoppers that must be rolled out to cover up things such as adultery.</p>
      <p>But we all know when we’re lying.</p>
      <p>We remember the experience from our earliest childhood.</p>
      <p>For most of us, the blessed relief is that we only have to do our lying to very small groups and – usually – in private.</p>
      <p>I used to feel very sorry for people when a stupid decision meant that they were forced to lie massively and obviously on the world stage.</p>
      <p>You’ll remember the pain of listening to Eddie Murphy claim he was just being a “good Samaritan” when he gave a lift to a prostitute.</p>
      <p>Or Bill Clinton wriggling around trying to define what he meant by “I did not have sexual relations with that woman”.</p>
      <p>Or Alan Clark saying he’d been “economical with the actualité”.</p>
      <p>But you’ll have noticed that these examples are all from the 90s, when blatantly lying your very teats off in public was still a relatively rare activity.</p>
      <p>Unlike now – when it is nothing less than a daily deluge.</p>
      <p>And this week I’ve been watching the utter cavalcade of lies unfolding in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">impeachment hearings</a> in America.</p>
      <p>It was a cheering moment in the hearings when, like an errant child, one of the liars got busted and nailed right to the wall.</p>
      <p>Democratic Congressman Patrick Maloney is a former lawyer of Irish descent and as tough as old boots.</p>
      <p>Republican ambassador Gordon Sondland is a smug, rich hotelier who donated a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration committee and then – mysteriously – found himself appointed US ambassador to the EU.</p>
      <p>It turned out to be a mixed blessing – Sondland is now up to his ears in the entire mess of Trump’s Ukraine lies.</p>
      <p>He gave a first statement to Congress that was so full of lies that he was forced to give a second statement, a declaration filled with lines such as “I NOW recall” and “it has become clear to me”.</p>
      <p>Basically, Sondland was saying: “What I said before contained some lies.” But even his second statement was full of holes.</p>
      <p>And now, here he was, in front of Congress and trying to wriggle around and tell lies for the third time. </p>
      <p>Maloney asked him a simple question: “Who would benefit from an investigation of the president’s political opponent?”</p>
      <p>Sondland thrashed about for a bit, trying desperately not to answer the question, going through the denial phase, but he was finally forced to say: “I assume President Trump.”</p>
      <p>“There we have it!” Maloney said delightedly as Sondland finally told the truth. “See? Didn’t hurt a bit!”</p>
      <p>The entire room erupted in laughter and applause.</p>
      <p>It was like watching Sean Connery’s Irish cop in The Untouchables facing down a bad Bond villain.</p>
      <p>But Sondland wasn’t having this. Now came the anger phase as he tried to act tough. “Mr Maloney,” he interrupted. “Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright. And I really resent what you’re trying to do here…”</p>
      <p>Let’s get this straight: Sondland, who had been lying his butt off, was now demanding to be respected for turning up and telling a tiny bit of truth.</p>
      <p>He resented being made fun of for lying.</p>
      <p>Well, Maloney let him have it with both barrels…</p>
      <p>“Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This is your third try to do so. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it?</p>
      <p>Then we had a little ‘declaration’ come in after that.</p>
      <p>“And now we’re here a third time and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning.</p>
      <p>There’s a whole bunch of stuff you ‘don’t recall’. So, all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candour but let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.”</p>
      <p>Sondland sat there, his bluster and pomp destroyed in an instant, silent, stony-faced and shamed.</p>
      <p>A child busted in the middle of a stupid lie.</p>
      <p>It did make me think… I cannot wait until they get Trump on the stand under oath.</p>
