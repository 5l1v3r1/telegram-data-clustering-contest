        <b>The International Film Festival of India wrongly used lyricist Gulzar’s picture in place of late Satyajit Ray’s in a biography dedicated to the latter. They later rectified their goof-up after being trolled on social media as the screenshot went viral</b>

      <p>The 50th edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) commenced on November 20 in Goa and some of the biggest stars from the film industry such as Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, Karan Johar and others attended the event. However, IFFI made a huge blunder when the official website wrongly used lyricist Gulzar’s picture in place of late Satyajit Ray’s in a biography dedicated to the latter. They later rectified their goof-up after being trolled on social media as the screenshot went viral.</p>
      <p>The official IFFI website, while mentioning the film Ganashatru,  and describing Satyajit Ray as the director, used famous lyricist Gulzar’s picture. While the film credit did correctly mention the name of the director, editor, screenplay-writer and others, it made a huge blunder with wrongly using Gulzar’s picture in place of Satyajit Ray’s. As soon as the gaffe was noticed, the picture went viral and IFFI was being trolled for their goof up. While one user wrote, “Naam goom jaayega chehra yeh badal jaayega," with laughing emojis, another wrote, “Wow! The guy who did this deserves a lifetime award!" <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/iffi-2019-opening-ceremony-amitabh-bachchan-and-rajinikanth-the-two-legends-kickstart-the-festival/5dd548f287fb571eff7e42c3">ALSO READ: IFFI 2019 Opening Ceremony: Amitabh Bachchan And Rajinikanth, The Two Legends Kickstart The Festival</a></p>

      <p>Immediately after, the organizers rectified their mistake and relaced Gulzar’s picture with that of Satyajit Ray’s. In other news, Rajinikanth was awarded the Icon of Golden Jubilee of IFFI. Rajinikanth also felicitated Amitabh Bachchan at the ceremony which was hosted by filmmaker Karan Johar. The festival’s opening ceremony was also attended by Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar, Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Amit Khare and Goa Chief Minister Pramod.</p>
