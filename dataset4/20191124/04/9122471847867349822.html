      <h1>Predicting The College Football AP Poll After Week 13 Of The 2019 Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:08:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>This Saturday was light on big-time matchups, but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t drama. No. 6 Oregon, thought to be a College Football Playoff contender, fell on the road to Arizona State in an absolute stunner.</p>
      <p>Ohio State, meanwhile, clinched the Big Ten East and a spot in the league’s title game with a win over Penn State. The Buckeyes continue to look like one of the best teams in the country.</p>
      <p>LSU, the No. 1 team in the playoff rankings, had little trouble with Arkansas. Elsewhere in the SEC, Alabama crushed Western Carolina while Georgia held off a late Texas A&amp;M comeback effort.</p>
      <p>At this point, we’re realistically down to only eight or nine teams that have a shot at the playoff. It’ll be fascinating to see how it all plays out.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we think the AP Poll top 25 will look like this Sunday:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Utah (plays Arizona late)</li>
        <li>Oklahoma</li>
        <li>Minnesota</li>
        <li>Florida</li>
        <li>Baylor</li>
        <li>Wisconsin</li>
        <li>Michigan</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Penn State</li>
        <li>Notre Dame</li>
        <li>Auburn</li>
        <li>Cincinnati</li>
        <li>Memphis</li>
        <li>Iowa</li>
        <li>Boise State (plays Utah State late)</li>
        <li>Oklahoma State</li>
        <li>Navy</li>
        <li>Appalachian State</li>
        <li>Virginia Tech</li>
        <li>Virginia</li>
      </ol>
      <p>College football fans – do we have it right?</p>
