      <h3>Petr Cech has heaped praise on Frank Lampard for the impact he has had since taking over at Chelsea FC this season.</h3>
      <p>Lampard has been earning lots of praise for the job he has been doing at Stamford Bridge since being brought in to replace Maurizio Sarri back in July.</p>
      <p>The former midfielder has placed his faith firmly in youth and has been giving the likes of Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount the chance to shine in the Chelsea FC team.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are currently in the race to claim a top-four finish this season and Lampard has had to work under the constraints of the Blues’ Fifa transfer ban.</p>
      <p>Cech was Lampard’s team-mate for many years at Stamford Bridge and the former Czech Republic international has talked up the impact that the ex-England international has had.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/frank-lampard-petr-cech-chelsea-has-done-a-remarkable-job-praises-former-team-mate">FourFourTwo</a>, Cech said: “The manager with his coaching staff has done a remarkable job.</p>
      <p>“They managed to integrate players in the team. The senior players were a huge help for the young players.</p>
      <p>“They help them become better and keep them grounded. And the biggest part is the coaching staff and the manager because he sets the tone on the training ground. He takes the biggest credit.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are in Champions League action on Wednesday night when they travel to Spain to take on Valencia.</p>
      <p>The west London side will then switch their attentions back towards Premier League affairs and their home clash against London rivals West Ham United next weekend.</p>
