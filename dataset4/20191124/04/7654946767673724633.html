      <h1>Top general warns Iran still a threat despite recent US troop deployment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Calder</a></address>
      <p>The Pentagon has deployed 14,000 more troops to the Middle East since May, but that likely won’t deter Iran from launching a major attack, the top US general in the war-torn ­region says.</p>
      <p>“I think the strike on Saudi Aramco in September is pretty indicative of a nation that is behaving irresponsibly,” Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of US Central Command, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/23/very-possible-iran-will-attack-again-top-us-general-says/">told ForeignPolicy.com</a>.</p>
      <p>“My judgment is that it is very possible they will ­attack again.”</p>
      <p>McKenzie was referring to the Sept. 14 Iran-sponsored<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/20/damage-at-saudi-oil-facilities-revealed-after-airstrikes/"> bombings on Saudi oil facilities</a>.</p>
      <p>He also told the news site that the US has dispatched an aircraft carrier and tens of thousands of pounds of military equipment and artillery to the Persian Gulf region in response to potential Iranian threats.</p>
      <p>McKenzie cautioned that Tehran’s actions in the region remain unpredictable.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t discount anything from Iran,” he said.</p>
      <p>“When a nation behaves that irresponsibly, you have to be very cautious when you evaluate what they might do in the future.”</p>
