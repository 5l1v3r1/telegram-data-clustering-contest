      <p>Arsenal fans are that done with Unai Emery after yesterday’s draw, they’re calling for former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino to replace him, reports dailystar.co.uk. The Gunners left it desperately late, needing a last-gasp Alexandre Lacazette goal to level proceedings against Southampton at the Emirates, in another dismal display.</p>
      <p>And it appears that fans are hoping the Arsenal board give former Tottenham chief Pochettino a call, just days after he was sacked and replaced by Jose Mourinho. Emery insists his job is safe and that he has the board’s backing.</p>
      <p>But Hector Bellerin this week admitted it has been tricky in recent weeks.“It’s been hard as a player in the dressing room sometimes to deal with these situations,” said the Spaniard in a video posted on Arsenal’s Twitter account.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s important as a club, as players, as fans, as anything (to know that) being divided is never the way forward.<br/>“Everyone demands different things, everyone demands different changes, but I don’t think that’s the way.“The (right) way is accepting who we are, what we have, getting everyone together, supporting each other, and that is the way that we can reach our goals because one doing one thing, the other one doing the other, it’s never going to work.”Elsewhere, Tottenham’s decision to change managers reaped instant rewards as Jose Mourinho got off to a winning start in his highly anticipated fourth coaching stint in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>How long before its north London neighbor, Arsenal, and Everton think about doing the same?Hours after Tottenham beat West Ham 3-2 in Mourinho’s first match in charge since replacing Mauricio Pochettino, Arsenal needed an injury-time goal to draw 2-2 at home to relegation candidate Southampton.</p>
      <p>Arsenal has won just one of its last seven matches in the league and boos rang around Emirates Stadium at the final whistle, leaving manager Unai Emery under more pressure.Everton’s Marco Silva is another manager who could be facing dismissal after his team lost 2-0 at home to Norwich, which started the game in last place.</p>
      <p>Liverpool maintained its eight-point lead by beating Crystal Palace 2-1 for its 12th win in 13 matches this campaign. Like many times this season, the victory was sealed in the final minutes with Roberto Firmino grabbing the winner in the 85th.Leicester stayed second after a 2-0 win at Brighton, with Jamie Vardy scoring for the fifth straight league game through a retaken penalty because of encroachment by Brighton players.In other results, Wolverhampton Wanderers beat 10-man Bournemouth 2-1 and Burnley won 3-0 at Watford, which returns to the bottom of the standings.</p>
