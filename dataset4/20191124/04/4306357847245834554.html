      <h3>Pep Guardiola has admitted that Liverpool FC look “almost unstoppable” in the Premier League title race this season.</h3>
      <p>The Reds currently find themselves flying high at the top of the Premier League table after having enjoyed an incredible start to the new campaign under Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC were impressive 3-1 winners over Guardiola’s Manchester City side before the international break as they underlined their status as the favourites to win the Premier League title this season.</p>
      <p>Guardiola, meanwhile, is aiming for his Manchester City side to get back to the top of the table as they eye their third Premier League title in a row.</p>
      <p>The Spanish head coach has clearly been very impressed by Liverpool FC’s start to the new campaign – but he has warned Klopp’s side that there is still a long way to go in the title race.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/pep-guardiola-dismisses-talk-leaving-manchester-city-says-loving/">interview</a> before this weekend’s round of fixtures, Guardiola said: “I have a feeling we are not far away from how we played in the last seasons but we have a team that is almost unstoppable and in incredible top form [in Liverpool].</p>
      <p>“They are the champions of Europe but we’re in November.</p>
      <p>“I know that to be there until the end we have to go on an incredible run of games but I think it will be a big mistake if you think too far ahead.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will return to Champions League action on Wednesday night with a home clash against Napoli.</p>
      <p>They will then switch their attentions back towards Premier League affairs and their home clash against Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday 30 November.</p>
