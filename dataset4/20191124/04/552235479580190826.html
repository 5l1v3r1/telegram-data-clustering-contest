      <h1>Raging neighbours can't move man living in van outside their home for two years</h1>
      <h2>Andy Calvert lives outside Cameron Weir and his mum Sheila's house in Lanarkshire and local council say they can't budge him.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Hyland</a></address>
      <p>A man who is living in a parked van outside a family home has refused to move despite their complaints.</p>
      <p>Andy Calvert has been in the same spot outside a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">house</a> occupied by Cameron Weir and his mum Sheila for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">two-and-a-half years</a>.</p>
      <p>Cameron and Sheila claim a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">wood burner</a> used by Andy causes fumes to pour into their house and back garden.</p>
      <p>But the local authority appears powerless to intervene and, while Andy says he sympathises, he is refusing to move.</p>
      <p>Cameron, 45, of Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, said: “We live in a quiet residential area and this really is making our life hell.</p>
      <p>“In summer, we can’t even enjoy sitting in our <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">back garden</a> because of the fumes from the vehicles and the stove.</p>

      <p>“It’s really noisy because when he works on his two cars and motorbike, he revs the engines.</p>
      <p>“He also has a number of people visiting and they are so loud that we can’t hear our TV in our living room. It’s a nightmare.”</p>
      <p>Cameron has complained to police and local MSP Christina McKelvie, who contacted <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">South Lanarkshire Council</a> on his behalf.</p>
      <p>But it is understood because the van sits on an unadopted road, the council has no authority to move the vehicle.</p>

      <p>A letter sent by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">local authority</a> to McKelvie last month stated that its On Street Living team monitored the area for three weeks and “no nuisance behaviour” was detected.</p>
      <p>When approached by the Sunday Mail, Andy blamed the council for his housing issues.</p>
      <p>He said: “The council evicted me from my flat because I fell behind on rent. I had nowhere to go but my van.</p>
      <p>“It was minus six that night and I had to kick the door open as it had <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">frozen</a> shut. Now they want me to declare myself homeless but I have somewhere to live.</p>
      <p>“They made me homeless so, until they admit that, I’m not moving.”</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old, who works as a long-distance lorry driver, has kitted out his van with a double bed, a TV, a fridge, and wood panelling for insulation. He uses a gas ring to cook, has a chemical toilet and showers at work.</p>

      <p>Andy admits the wood burner he bought for £50 from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">eBay</a> was “smokey at first” but claims it is better now.</p>
      <p>The van also uses batteries for power and has two gas canisters and solar panels.</p>
      <p>Despite sympathising with Cameron and Sheila, Andy is refusing to move.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve nothing against them. They have a nice fancy house and don’t want a hobo at their back door. But I’m not breaking any laws. It’s my choice and a matter of principle.”</p>

      <p>South Lanarkshire Council’s executive director of housing Daniel Lowe said: “The council is aware of the concerns raised by Mr Weir and his mother and has kept them fully updated on our position in relation to this matter.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, at this juncture, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/sleeping-out-help-citys-vulnerable-20935149">council</a> does not have sufficient evidence to raise a court action for unlawful encampment but is continuing to monitor this situation closely on an ongoing basis and is keeping this matter under review.”</p>
