      <p>FLATBUSH, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police believe a landlord-tenant dispute may have sparked an assault that left a man in Brooklyn unconscious.</p>
      <p>Muthana Abdulla has weeks of recovery with dozens of staples in his head and numerous large bruises on his body after an attack last week.</p>
      <p>Police say the attackers used baseball bats and a metal pipe to brutally beat Abdulla just down the sidewalk from his grocery store on Nostrand Ave. - a shop he has owned with his brother for two decades after their move from Yemen.</p>
      <p>"They kept on beating my head - they hit me multiple times, I have cracks in my head, the blood was all over," said Abdulla.</p>
      <p>Investigators are now searching for Saeed Ali, 58, and Faud Quaid, 45. A possible motive for the attack is a landlord-tenant dispute.</p>
      <p>Abdulla says after a lengthy court battle, he was evicted but then Ali wanted him to leave the store items that Abdulla purchased, behind.</p>
      <p>"If you rent from someone, he's not allowed to keep your refrigeration, what you have spent in the store just because he decides to evict you," Abdulla added.</p>
      <p>When Abdullah and his brother refused Ali's demands, he says Ali and his relatives took matters into their own hands by using violence.</p>
      <p>The store is now closed, and Abdulla is in the process of moving to a new location. He says he wants the suspects caught and brought to justice.</p>
