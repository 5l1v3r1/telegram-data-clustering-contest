      <p>Parents have been tasked to be worthy role models to their wards as this will be major means of curbing social vices in the society.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a one-day Parenting Forum tagged “Parents as Social Agents of Change” and organised by the Domestic Violence Unit, Ministry of Women Affairs &amp; Poverty Alleviation, the Honourable Commissioner, Mrs. Cecila Bolaji Dada, pointed out that parents need to set good examples for their wards so as to avoid bad behavioural pattern that is setting young ones on the path of destruction.</p>
      <p>The theme, according to Dada, is apt and timely considering the menace of social vices ravaging the country and the world at large.</p>
      <p>“Today, we have vices such as cultism, prostitution, incessant rape cases, drugs, among others, which are not limited to a particular age bracket or race, partly because most parents are not available and are also carefree about their children,” she said. Parenting, Dada revealed, is not limited to the biological parents alone but rather it is a tripartite phenomenon which consists of the home, school and the society and what is fed into the child from home front is what is taken to the larger society.</p>
      <p>“It is therefore the duty of the government, parents and everyone to shield our children away from quarrels, troubles and in-fighting which takes place in some homes. This is the reason the ministry has put the symposium together. It is aimed at enlightening parents on how ‘not’ to become negative influence in the lives of their wards,” said Dada.</p>
      <p>Also speaking on “Parenting Techniques to Curb Delinquency”, the Assistant Director, Social Welfare, Mr. Yakubu Abisogun, said being a parent in the life of a child is all-encompassing in thinking, speaking, dressing, relationship communication etc which most parents are seriously lagging behind. His words: “Delinquency in a child can to some extent be traced to parents. Your life is your child, you are indirectly your child, hence as parents we need to look inwards.”</p>
      <p>On her part, the Assistant Chief Education, Ministry of Education, Bose Oderinde, urged parents to try and do things differently to effect positive changes. “It all starts from the relationship between husband and wife in the home; we are a function of the children we have now,” she said.</p>
      <p>Corroborating this fact, an officer in the Drug Demand Reduction Unit, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Mrs. Titilayo Ogunluyi, who spoke on ‘Parenting Styles against Substance Abuse’, charged parents not to be absent in the lives of their wards, but rather be present, adding that to be an agent of change, parents must also change.</p>
      <p>Participants were drawn from all local government areas in the state.</p>
