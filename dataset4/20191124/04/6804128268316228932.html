      <h1>Arsenal news: Raul Sanllehi meeting, the man to replace Unai Emery, Kieran Tierney criticism</h1>
      <h2>All the latest news coming out of Arsenal Football Club as Emery feels the pressure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>It was another weekend without a win for Unai Emery and Arsenal.</p>
      <p>And the pressure is only going to mount on the Spaniard's shoulders.</p>
      <p>It is now five games without a win in the Premier League, and it was almost a really embarrassing weekend for the Gunners.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette struck a 96th minute equaliser to spare Arsenal's blushes against a Southampton side in the bottom three.</p>
      <p>There is nowhere to hide for Emery or his players, as we enter a hectic run of fixtures both domestically and in Europe.</p>
      <p>Here we round-up all of the biggest Arsenal stories from the past 24 hours, with plenty of focus on Emery's future.</p>
      <h3>Raul Sanllehi meeting</h3>
      <p>Unai Emery's job is on the line.</p>
      <p>Although that is not what directors Raul Sanllehi and Vinai Venkatesham have said of late.</p>
      <p>Prior to the international break, Emery was given a vote of confidence from the duo, with a statement saying they had full faith in the SPaniard to turn things around.</p>

      <p>A draw with Southampton will not have helped in that regard though.</p>
      <p>Could they really change their minds just one match later?</p>
      <p>It transpires there may well have been a meeting - in the dressing room - between Sanllehi, Venkatesham and Emery.</p>

      <h3>The chants</h3>
      <p>Chants about being sacked in the morning usually come from opposition fans towards a manager under pressure.</p>
      <p>So when they come from your own supporters you know something is awry.</p>

      <p>That was the case at the Emirates on Saturday, with the Gunners supporters making their feelings known.</p>

      <h3>Kieran Tierney criticism</h3>
      <p>There were plenty of poor performances at the Emirates on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Nothing is going right for Unai Emery right now and one of his summer signings, who has drawn praise up until now, was in the firing line on Saturday afternoon.</p>

      <p>Tierney gave away the penalty from which James Ward-Prowse scored the rebound to put Saints 2-1 up.</p>
      <p>And Joleon Lescott, watching on Sky Sports, was not impressed.</p>

      <h3>Match action</h3>
      <p>An early Danny Ings goal set the tone for the afternoon at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Arsenal switched off, allowing the Saints to score from a quickly-taken free-kick and while Alexandre Lacazette equalised a James Ward-Prowse goal in the second half put them back on the back foot.</p>
      <p>Lacazette spared their blushes with another equaliser to secure a point.</p>
