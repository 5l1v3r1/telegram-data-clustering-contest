      <p>The fans’ recognition only adds to McLaughlin’s high profile, which has soared this season following a second successive championship win and maiden Bathurst win.</p>
      <p>McLaughlin first claimed the Most Popular Driver Award in 2017, and ended now-retired Craig Lowndes’ domination of the accolade.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi acknowledged fans for their continued appreciation: “It’s a very cool award. Fans are the backbone of our sport and why we go racing. I’m really proud to have a lot of support out there through thick and thin and proud to do it for them all.”</p>

      <p>The Shell squad, however, saw its fan-voted Best Presented Team Award go across to Penrite Racing.</p>
      <p>The Holden team ended Shell V-Power Racing’s two-year stranglehold on the award, and comes in a season which the Penrite colours were displayed in several striking ways.</p>
      <p>Notably, away from the standard livery, Penrite Racing ran a ‘liquid gold’ paint job for Bathurst, a retro JPS look for Sandown, and a scheme inspired by rock band KISS for the Gold Coast and Newcastle events.</p>
      <p>Team owner Betty Klimenko praised her squad for their efforts: “The team has done a wonderful job. They really deserve it because they went against everything that I said and it’s probably why they won the award.”</p>
