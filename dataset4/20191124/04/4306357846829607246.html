      <h3>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is confident that Manchester United still have what it takes to seal a top-four finish this season.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils have struggled to find consistent form in the Premier League this season and they currently find themselves well off the pace in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Manchester United have only won four of their opening 12 Premier League games to leave them languishing behind the likes of Manchester City, Leicester City and Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will attempt to make it back to back wins in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon when they travel to Sheffield United in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is still adamant that Manchester United have what it takes to finish in the top four despite their stuttering start to the new campaign.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-aiming-to-cut-the-gap-to-top-four-rivals">news conference</a> on Friday, Solskjaer said: “We’ve still got to keep looking up the table.</p>
      <p>“It’s so close, but it’s a long gap up to the top four. We’ve got City next month, very soon, so we’ve got a chance to claw some points back.</p>
      <p>“We know we’re getting players back, we’re getting better and improving as a team, so, hopefully, we can challenge when it comes towards the end.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen Marcus [Rashford] talk about it this week, it’s not just about getting into the top four, but that’s a little bit of a goal for us, of course.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United finished in sixth place and without a trophy in Solskjaer’s first season in charge at Old Trafford last term.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils will return to Premier League action next weekend with a home clash against Aston Villa at Old Trafford.</p>
