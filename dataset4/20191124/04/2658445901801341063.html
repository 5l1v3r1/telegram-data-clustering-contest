      <p>Barring any unforseen circumstance the year 2020 budget of Lagos state presented to the State House of Assembly about two weeks ago by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will be passed before the end of the year by the lawmakers.</p>
      <p>Chief Whip of the House, Hon. Rotimi Abiru disclosed this while answering reporters questions at the venue of the annual national delegates’ conference of the Association of Hansard/Verbatim Reporters of Nigeria at Ikeja.</p>
      <p>“The second reading has just been taken on the floor of the House and it is a process, all I can say is that it is our desire to see that the budget is passed before the end of the year, all things being equal.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we look forward to a hitch-free budget process and we require and seek for the support of the executive to avail us all necessary documents that would help in the passage of the budget, once that is done I am sure it is our desire to pass it before the end of the year,” Abiru said.</p>

      <p>Declaring the conference, with the theme:  ‘The challenges facing the production of Hansard and the way out’, open earlier, Abiru who represented Speaker Mudashiru Obasa said Hansard is a very important document in the parliament that contains everything said during proceedings in parliament.</p>
      <p>In his welcome address earlier, Clerk of the House, Mr. Azeez Sanni who was represented by Mr. Taiwo Ottun, Head, Legislative Directorate, told the Hansard/Verbatim reporters that their “roles have been remarkably instrumental to the growth and development of our democracy and legislative institutions”.</p>
