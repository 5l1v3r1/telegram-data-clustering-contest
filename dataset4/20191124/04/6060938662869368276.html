      <p>SURAT: India and Haryana leg-spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/yuzvendra-singh-chahal">Yuzvendra Chahal</a> knows a thing or two about uncertainty. Having risen to prominence through age-group cricket, Chahal was part of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/2018-ipl-auction-complete-ipl-squad-of-mumbai-indians/articleshow/62683658.cms">Mumbai Indians</a>' squad for a couple of seasons but rarely got chances to showcase his skills.</p>
      <p>A change of franchise - from MI to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-auction-2018-complete-squad-of-royal-challengers-bangalore/articleshow/62690441.cms">Royal Challengers Bangalore</a> (RCB) - triggered a dramatic change in his fortunes. He not only graduated to becoming a critical cog in RCB's wheel, he has gone on to become a force to reckon with for India in ODIs along with spin partner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kuldeep-Yadav">Kuldeep Yadav</a>. The duo had made it to the side at the expense of senior pros like Ravichandra Ashwin and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravindra-jadeja">Ravindra Jadeja</a>.</p>
      <p>There was a change in script once again for the 29-year-old, though. He was not considered for India's tour of the West Indies and then ignored again when the South Africans toured India recently.</p>
      <p>After having spent some time on the sidelines, Chahal made a strong comeback against the visiting Bangladesh. And he says that he can't do much about things that are beyond his control.</p>
      <p>"Somethings are not in your hands and I was not thinking about that. It was a decision that the selectors made. It is something similar to when they picked me and Kuldeep, back then and they rested Ashwin and Jadeja. I guess that's how things work," Chahal, who is part of Haryana's T20 side participating in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy here, says.</p>
      <p>Missing the series against West Indies and South Africa gave Chahal time for some retrospection. And during the time he was away from national duty, Chahal went back to domestic cricket to iron out his shortcomings.</p>
      <p>"I was part of my state side in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Baroda. So yeah the idea is to keep playing as much as you can. Be it for India or my state side. It is important to keep playing," he says.</p>
      <p>India, in the last few years, have developed a very competitive talent pool. There is always someone waiting to replace the other in the team. But Chahal seems completely unperturbed about having to miss out. In fact, he suggests that competition is good for the growth of a team.</p>
      <p>"It is a good thing to have a strong bench strength. You need to work hard because if you are not performing well there are three or four guys ready, waiting behind you," he says.</p>
      <p>The shorter formats have become extremely demanding these days and the team management expects every member to bring to the table something more than just the usual skill sets they possess. Chahal admits that if a bowler can enhance a little bit of his batting skills it will hold him in good stead. But he also insists that the prime focus should be to work on the skills that you already have.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes when I get the time, I do try and bat. But in the T20 format, I mostly concentrate on my bowling. Obviously, it helps if you can have a couple of big shots, especially if the team requires six runs off one ball," he says.</p>
      <p>What the future holds for Chahal is not known. For now though, all his focus is channelized towards guiding his team in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.</p>
