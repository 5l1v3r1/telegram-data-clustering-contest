      <h2>As part of the Sunday Mail Leave the Keys anti-drink driving campaign Charles Pease reveals how he was left heartbroken after losing 29-year-old Theresa Wade.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Hyland</a></address>
      <p>When the door banged loudly in the middle of the night, Charles Pease looked at the clock. It was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">4am</a>.</p>
      <p>He knew being disturbed at that time rarely brought good news.</p>
      <p>His partner Theresa Wade had not made it home from her work as a vet as planned but he thought her absence was down to an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">out-of-hours</a> call.</p>
      <p>When he saw two grim-faced <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">police officers</a> on his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">doorstep</a>, Charles thought he was prepared for the worst. He was wrong.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’d been concerned that Theresa hadn’t arrived back for supper but when she didn’t appear I assumed she would be staying at the surgery, as she did often if there was an emergency.</p>

      <p>“I went to bed and was awoken by police at 4am. I knew it wasn’t going to be good news but I assumed they were there about my elderly father.</p>
      <p>“Instead, the policewoman said to me, ‘Are you the partner of Theresa Wade and does she drive a white ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">Citroen Berlingo</a> van?’ My blood ran cold. I had to sit down.</p>
      <p>“She went on to say, ‘I’m sorry to tell you that she was involved in a road traffic accident and as a consequence she died.’</p>
      <p>“It’s as if someone had taken a swing at my legs with a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">baseball ba</a>t. It hit my mind, my heart, it hit everything. The world just ended.”</p>
      <p>Theresa died when the high-powered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">Maserati</a> Thomas ­Wainwright was driving ploughed into her van on the Isle of Mull in October 2015. She was 29 years old.</p>
      <p>Wainwright was driving on the wrong side of the road when he crashed into Theresa’s van on the A849 near Craignure. At the point of impact, he was travelling at 69mph.</p>
      <p>Wainwright was jailed for 12 years and banned for 15 years following a trial in 2017.</p>
      <p>Four years on from Theresa’s death, the moment he discovered his partner of 10 years had died in the head-on ­collision is always with Charles, 64.</p>
      <p>Speaking from his home at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">Kinloch</a> on Mull, Charles said: “One minute I was waiting for Theresa to arrive home for supper and the next I was ­identifying her body.”</p>
      <p>He last spoke to his partner on the phone hours before her death.</p>
      <p>She had called to say she would be home soon but did not turn up.</p>
      <p>The following day, Charles had to endure the ordeal of formally ­identifying Theresa’s body.</p>
      <p>He added: “I was met by two traffic officers and an undertaker. I was with a friend who came for moral ­support.</p>

      <p>“Somebody had to identify Theresa so I felt I should, in order to save anyone else having to go through with it.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">undertaker</a> told me that the injuries were sufficiently harsh so he had covered up the worst to avoid ­adding to the distress.</p>
      <p>“I could see it was Theresa.</p>
      <p>“Shock kicks in. It was incredibly distressing. It was the first time I’d seen someone so close to me dead.</p>
      <p>“It was just a formality. It wasn’t the Theresa I knew, it was the remains of Theresa.”</p>
      <p>His trial heard that Wainwright had downed whisky and cider during an eight-hour drinking binge and sneered to bar staff “the car knows its own way home” before taking to the wheel.</p>
      <p>Wainwright and his passenger claimed Theresa had been on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident but a jury did not believe his lies and he was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">Charles</a> says that Wainwright’s ­“selfish” actions changed his life forever and the lives of the many people who loved Theresa the moment he got behind the wheel drunk.</p>

      <p>He said: “Wainwright had refused to take a breath test. I saw the pictures on the internet of the car.</p>
      <p>“I could see the damage and speed that had been involved. She never stood a chance.</p>
      <p>“During the trial he was sitting directly in front of myself and Theresa’s family. He never looked at us.</p>
      <p>“When I first saw him I had feelings I’d never felt before – a pathological hatred.</p>
      <p>“Finally, in front of me was the man that had killed the woman I loved.</p>
      <p>“He’d killed Theresa, nearly killed his passenger and nearly killed himself, all for the sake of drinking and behaving like an idiot.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">Grief-stricken</a> Charles, now retired, closed the doors of the hotel he ran to take over Theresa’s vet’s practice.</p>
      <p>He said: “At 29 she had run the biggest solo vet’s practice in Britain so she got to know so many people intimately through her work.</p>
      <p>“When Theresa was killed her ­practice was in serious jeopardy. I did everything that time didn’t allow her to do.</p>
      <p>“Theresa was a remarkable woman. She had a future and Wainwright stole that from her, from me and everyone who loved her.”</p>
      <p>Charles has shared Theresa’s story to help prevent anyone from getting behind the wheel after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/drink-driver-almost-seven-times-20922376">drinking</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: “It has a ripple effect. A ­drink-driver’s selfish actions affect the innocent person in the other car but also so many other people. It’s ­immeasurable.”</p>
      <p>Charles added: “I’m entirely ­supportive of the Sunday Mail’s ­campaign and anything that <br/>stops drink-driving and saves people is worth it.”</p>
