      <p>Wintry mix will change to snow this morning, which may still cause<br/>untreated roads to become slick, mainly at higher elevations this<br/>morning. 1 to 2 inches of snow accumulation will be possible in<br/>the higher terrain, with lesser amounts of slushy accumulation in<br/>the valleys. Exercise caution if traveling this morning.</p>
