      <h3><a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191122/471782380235/el-plan-de-fichajes-del-barca-para-2020.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a> claims that Barcelona intends to sell players in January 2020 in an effort to balance the accounts.</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.goal.com/g00/fr/news/la-tres-grosse-somme-que-le-barca-doit-recuperer-des-ventes/18irw2372w2eq17s7um4qh98b4?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&amp;i10c.dv=13"><b>Goal</b></a>, Barcelona are planning to earn 124 million euros in transfers before July of 2020.</p>
      <p>The Catalonia giants must await Bayern Munich’s decision over Philippe Coutinho as the German side have the option to purchase the loanee for 120 million euros.  The purchase would practically resolve Barca’s financial problems but the Brazilians recent performance for the Bavarian side has seen him receive his first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/philippe-coutinho-facing-criticism-not-20543063"><b>criticism</b></a> with the club. It is possible that the German club may decline the purchase offer unless the midfielder manages to impress in the remainder of the season.</p>
      <p>The excessive amount of options in the middle of the park is another reason for the Blaugranas to try and sell some midfielders in January.</p>
      <p>Here are 6 players Barca should look to sell in the winter transfer window,</p>
      <p>First up we have Ivan Rakitic and Umtiti who once were the undisputed starters for the Spanish giants but have failed to deliver in the recent endeavor of the club.</p>

      <h4>Ivan Rakitic</h4>
      <p>This one might not come as a surprise to many as Rakitic has lost his importance under Valverde this season. Rakitic has had five impressive seasons with Barca, since his arrival in 2014, but has recently failed to perform when it mattered the most. The Croatian, previously the number one choice, has only managed to start two League games along with seven substitute appearances this season.</p>
      <p>The Spanish giants are hoping to sell the 31-year-old in January but ultimately will depend on the player’s own choices. Rakitic will definitely have to demand a reasonable wage in order to finalize a midseason transfer.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191108/471445700585/la-juve-vuelve-a-la-carga-con-rakitic-con-el-inter-al-acecho.html"><b>sources</b></a>, Juventus and Inter Milan have previously attempted to sign the midfielders back in August, with AC Milan joining in on the chase.</p>
      <h4>Samuel Umtiti</h4>
      <p>There is no doubt that Umtiti was regarded as one of the best defenders in world football but since his reoccurring knee injury, the French international looks like a shadow of his former self.</p>
      <p>Club and country teammate Clement Lenglet has established himself alongside ageing Gerrard Pique as the main center backs for the club.</p>
      <p>Fans of the club are losing interest in the Frenchman’s appearances and are hoping to see the former Lyon defender replaced in the winter transfer window.</p>
      <p>Blaugrana will not accept anything less than 50 million for the world cup winner. With the player’s contract expiring in 2023, Barca might have to keep the player around if no favorable offers arrive for the defender.</p>

      <h4>Arturo Vidal</h4>
      <p>Vidal has been Valverde’s gamble this season with the Chilean’s performance being a coin flip for the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has recently <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2860291-arturo-vidal-not-happy-at-barcelona-talks-antonio-conte-amid-inter-rumours"><b>revealed</b></a> that he is unhappy with the Catalonia side due to his playing time. This season Vidal has made 12 appearances for the club, starting in only 4 of those games. Comparing this to last season where the player made 53 appearances and started 29 of those, it clearly shows the player has lost his starter position under Valverde.</p>
      <blockquote>“I will work hard to not leave this club and contribute to our seasonal objectives. But I’m not happy. Even if I’m trying to get through this situation and earn a place in the starting lineup.” Vidal stated.</blockquote>
      <p>It would not be a surprise if the Chile international decides to push for an exit in January, especially due to the heavily packed midfield at the club.</p>
      <h4>Carles Alena</h4>
      <p>Many fans were hoping to see the youngster get more games this season but Alena has struggled to find his minutes under Valverde. The 21-year-old has barely made any appearances for the Catalonia side and will hope to secure a loan elsewhere to find his minutes.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is wanted by many across European football with interests coming from several Spanish first division teams along with two Premier League teams. <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/milan-su-alena-il-barcellona-apre-ma-detta-la-condizioni-12353"><b>Sources</b></a> even claim that Italian giants AC Milan are also closely monitoring the Player’s situation.</p>
      <p>Barca, however, prefers to play the midfielder in Spain where they can closely monitor his progress. <a href="https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/betis/2019/10/29/betis-tento-verano-riqui-puig/249573.html"><b>Estadio Deportivo</b></a> has reported that Real Betis, Getafe, Celta Vigo, and Granada are all interested in the youngster.</p>

      <h4>Jean-Clair Todibo</h4>
      <p>Recent <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barca-are-looking-to-sell-todibo-to-bayer-leverkusen-in-january-7744445"><b>reports</b></a> claim that Barca are looking to sell Todibo in January and many English, French and German clubs have already lined up their offers.</p>
      <p>Barcelona have made the youngster available, provided there will be a buy-back clause included in the deal. <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/22/barcelona-starlet-leave-this-january/"><b>Reports</b></a> have Bayern Leverkusen as the favourites to secure the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Todibo joined the Spanish side in January 2018 on a free transfer from Toulouse. He was regarded by many as the future defender for the club but barely managed to find playing time under Valverde. Barca realises that the defender needs to play in order to develop and so will allow other teams to bid for the youngster.</p>
      <p>The asking price is 10 million euros with an option to buy back for a reasonable price.</p>
      <h4>Moussa Wague</h4>
      <p>Wague is another player scouted by the German side, Bayern Leverkusen, with several other clubs ready to offer. The Catalan club may allow the defender to leave on a loan or even look to sell him with a buyback option.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese international joined the club in 2018 for a fee of 5 million euros and made his debut against Huesca last April. He also appeared against Eibar and Celta Vigo towards the end of the campaign. This season, the defender has managed to make only two appearances under Valverde, including this week’s clash against Leganes due to injury sustained by Semedo and the suspension of Sergi Roberto.</p>
      <p>Who would you like to see leave the club in January 2020?</p>
