      <p>President Donald Trump’s impeachment hearings may have been set in Washington, D.C., but comedian Randy Rainbow brought them to the Sooner State of “Oklahoma!” with his latest parody song set to the tune of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “I Cain’t Say No.”</p>
      <p>“He’s just a gurl who’ll quid pro quo/blackmail’s his fav’rite response,” the lyrics go in Rainbow’s latest video. “He’ll badger any friend or foe/until he gets what he wants.”</p>
      <p>Rainbow edited himself into real footage from the five days of hearings, posing as the House Intelligence Committee chairman questioning State Department employees Stephanie Williams and George Kent, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Ambassador William Taylor.</p>

      <p>Cuing Republican Rep. Devin Nunes to “give me my note” on a clarinet – you read that right – Rainbow began.</p>
      <p>“His phone calls ain’t as ‘perfect’ as the picture that he paints,” Rainbow sings. “He’s full of so much crap he’s turning’ brown.”</p>
      <p>By song’s end, Rainbow calls the POTUS “a ho,” “a petulant kid,” and “a fool who’ll gladly throw any old country a bone, long as they bow to his thrown.”</p>
      <p>In an August interview with CNN’s John Berman, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/comedian-randy-rainbow-says-his-satirical-trump-songs-are-healing-video/">Rainbow explained</a> the popularity of his videos, which lampoon Trump and nearly everyone in his administration: “I understand now that what I’m doing is really even more important than I knew. I think it’s just a testament to how healing and important — especially in times like this — humor is.”</p>
