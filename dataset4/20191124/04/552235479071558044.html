      <h1>TSB faces customer backlash after bank payment glitch sees wages delayed</h1>
      <h2>TSB confirmed there was an error in processing ­payments overnight and said it was working to fix the issues.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Micklethwaite</a></address>
      <p>A bank glitch meant thousands of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/banks">TSB </a>customers were waiting to receive their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/money-worries">wages, ­pensions and ­benefits</a> yesterday.</p>
      <p>TSB confirmed there was an error in processing ­payments overnight and said it was working to fix the issues.</p>
      <p>A TSB spokesman said: “We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues this morning.</p>
      <p>“We are ­investigating the cause and apologise for any ­inconvenience caused.”</p>
      <p>Customers have vented their frustration at TSB’s failure to sort out their funds on social media.</p>
      <p>One wrote: “TSB are ­playing with me today. Firstly, my pay hasn’t gone through. Secondly, they had the cheek to send a, ‘You are nearing your credit’ text.</p>
      <p>“Thirdly, I have been on hold for about 20 minutes and then cut off. Twice.”</p>
      <p>Another added: “TSB, yet another b***** mess you’re leaving your customers in. Why are my wages not ­processed?”</p>
      <p>And another said: “Money hasn’t gone in. Had to reset all my online banking details and it still won’t let me log in.”</p>
      <p>Others claimed the issue left them short of cash at a crucial time.</p>
      <p>One frustrated ­customer wrote: “Had to walk this morning due to TSB due not being able to put my wages in my bank.”</p>
      <p>This is not the first time TSB customers have had problems.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Barclays and TSB went down, locking customers out of their apps.</p>
      <p>The latest problem was the second outage for TSB in a week.</p>
      <p>TSB added if­ ­customers needed ­emergency cash, they should contact them via the ­number on the back of their bank card.</p>
