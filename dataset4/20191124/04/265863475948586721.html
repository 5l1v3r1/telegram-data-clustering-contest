      <h1>R. Kelly’s Attorney Claims Joycelyn Savage Is Lying To Get Money — Fans Also Have Their Own Theory That The Singer Is In On It!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:15:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Now that R. Kelly is locked up and has a slim to none chance of getting released from jail any time soon, his (ex) girlfriend is speaking out. After she started to detail what happened to her via social media, the singer’s attorney has decided to refute her claims.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn Savage was allegedly recruited by R. Kelly when she was 19-years-old with hope for a music career that turned into her being his live-in girlfriend that had to abide by strict rules.</p>
      <p>However, the R&amp;B musician’s attorney Steve Greenberg said that the woman is only saying these things because she is in need of money.</p>

      <p>The lawyer tweeted: ‘It is unfortunate that Jocelyn now seeks to make money by exploiting her long time, loving relationship with Robert. Obviously if she were to tell the truth no one would pay so she has, unfortunately, chosen to regurgitate the stories and lies told by others for her own personal profit.  We know the real facts, and it was not until the money ran out that she decided anything was wrong. Hopefully people will see it for the Obvious profiteering it is.’</p>
      <p>Opinions are split when it comes to Joycelyn’s story. Some feel that she is only speaking out because R. Kelly is no longer able to provide for her while others feel that it’s her story to tell and she may have been scared of the consequences had she spoken out before he was locked away.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there are quite a few spectators in the comment section of the Shade Room and the Neighborhood Talk that believe that this could be a scheme set up by the singer himself!</p>
      <p>These conspiracy theorists believe that now that Robert’s well has run dry, he is going to use his remaining girlfriends to make him money while maintaining his innocence. What do you believe?</p>
