      <h1>'The correct decision' - Pep Clotet lauded as Birmingham City gear up for Garry Monk reunion</h1>
      <h2>Birmingham City news | All the reaction to Blues' 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <h3>Mini match report</h3>
      <p>Birmingham City came from behind to secure just their second draw of the season in an open game at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>Blues went 1-0 down to a clinical 55th minute finish from Frazier Campbell - but dragged themselves back into the game when Lukas Juktiewicz flicked home Marc Roberts' header.</p>
      <p>Pep Clotet made three changes to his team - including replacing the out-of-form Lee Camp with Connal Trueman in goal.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old will be encouraged by just the third start of his Blues career.</p>

      <p>Jeremie Bela was given a full debut as Clotet also changed shape to a 4-2-3-1, with the Frenchman and the recalled Jacques Maghoma operating in the wide positions.</p>
      <p>That matched up what Huddersfield did and predictably it was quite a tight first half with the best opening coming for Town in the 36th minute.</p>
      <p>Alex Pritchard crossed in from the right, Elias Kachunga wriggled  between the Blues centre backs and headed straight at Trueman from eight yards.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper pushed it back out to Frazier Campbell who closed in but Marc Roberts charged down his shot.</p>

      <p>Just before half time Trueman also pulled off a decent save low to his right from Pritchard’s free kick.</p>
      <p>As for Blues they got themselves into decent positions with Maxime Colin, Jude Bellingham, Bela and Maghoma all sending over crosses from their right.</p>
      <p>However, none could find a team-mate and the closest the visitors got to a goal was on the half hour when Bellingham won the ball just outside the area on the left, chopped away from his defender but fired high over the near post.</p>
      <p>Campbell made no such mistake ten minutes after the restart though.</p>

      <p>There wasn’t enough pressure on the ball in the Town half and Trevoh Chalobah had time to look up and pick out Campbell running off Roberts,</p>
      <p>The striker took the ball in stride and lifted it past the onrushing Trueman.</p>
      <p>Blues wobbled temporarily as Kachunga had another free header after Clarke-Salter slipped - once more straight at the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>But they pressed for an equaliser with crosses from Colin and sub Jefferson Montero starting to fly through the penalty area.</p>
      <p>The leveller came 12 minutes from the end when Dan Crowley’s free kick from the left was flicked on at the near post and Roberts headed goalwards, with Jutkiewicz claiming the final touch.</p>
      <h3>What Pep said</h3>
      <p>"It was a hard fought point, you knew it was going to be very difficult, they are in good form at home, we knew they would press us a lot.</p>
      <p>"We knew today we would have to be a bit more patient with the ball, try to dominate possession when it was very difficult to get possession.</p>
      <p>"We knew that if we managed to break this press the game would open up a little bit more in wide areas.</p>
      <p>"That’s why we went a little bit wider today.</p>

      <p>"I think the effort was there, despite the set-back of them scoring first because it looked like it was going to be a game of the first one who scores can take the points.</p>
      <p>"The team kept believing and although we had a little spell where we were nervous, obviously going away from home and everything is a little bit more difficult, I think the team managed the game superbly.</p>
      <p>"The players coming off the bench all made a big impact."</p>
      <h3>What Cowley said</h3>
      <p>"In 13 or so years in football management, after about 800-odd games, that's probably the toughest team that I've had to select.</p>
      <p>"To lose three of your back four in what is already an unbalanced squad has made it very, very difficult. But I have to credit the players, particularly the ones playing out of position.</p>
      <p>"For their goal we didn't react quickly enough and that was the only real clear-cut chance they had - and that's the disappointing thing."</p>
      <h3>Fans are chuffed for Trueman</h3>
      <p>Alex Hatch: Buzzing to see Trueman in goal, just need to bring Ramos onto the bench and get rid of the dead wood and buy a decent striker.</p>
      <p>David Ricks: I hope the lad gets given a good chance.</p>
      <p>Peter Lewis: Well done young man, the correct decision to make a change.</p>
      <p>Peter Davis: Well done Pep the team will click ..then go mad scoring goals for fun. You have a plan I just hope the negative comments do not put you off. A draw at Huddersfield away a decent result..The wins will come.</p>
      <h3>Next up?</h3>
      <p>Blues face former manager Garry Monk for the first time since his summer exit on Wednesday. Clotet takes his team to Hillsborough to meet Monk's Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
