      <p>The Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, will on Thursday November 28 deliver the 2019 Ajasin Foundation Colloquium at the International Event Centre Akure, the Ondo State capital.</p>
      <p>The programme in honour of the first executive governor of Ondo State, Chief Adekunle Ajasin, was initiated in 1999.</p>
      <p>Addressing reporters at the weekend, the Non- Executive Secretary of the Foundation, who spoke on behalf of the Board of Trustees (BoT), Mrs Jumoke Anifowose, said the current year’s activities which began few weeks ago with the secondary schools debate will end on November 27.</p>
      <p>She said: “On November 26, there will be the annual presentation to Ajasin Scholars at Owo High School initiated by Dr. ‘Bode Ogunleye, an old student of Owo High School who is currently based in the United States of America.</p>
      <p>“The scholarship programme was instituted as his contribution in support of academic excellence in his alma mater. It involves the award of financial reward for the overall best student in each year, from JS 1 – SS 3.</p>
      <p>Anifowose, who is the daughter of the late Afenifere leader, said Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu is the chief host to be supported by his colleagues in the South west states.</p>
