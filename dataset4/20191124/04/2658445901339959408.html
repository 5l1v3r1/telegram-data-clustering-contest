      <p>THE police authorities in South Africa have arraigned in court eight of their officers over the torture and murder of a Nigerian, Ibrahim Olamilekan Badmus.</p>
      <p>Trying them is the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria</p>
      <p>The accused persons – two women and six men – were arrested in October 2017 by police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, for the torture and the murder of 25-year-old Badmus who was accused of selling drugs in the Vanderbijlpark area.</p>
      <p>The court heard that on October 10, 2017 the police officers pounced on the community where the deceased used to stay following a tip-off about drugs being sold in the house.</p>
      <p>In their affidavits, the eight cops claimed that while conducting their operation they found Badmus unresponsive from a drug overdose. This version of events was disputed by state witness, Chukwuemeka Nelson Ozor, who was in the house on the day of the incident.</p>

      <p>Ozor told Judge Mokhine Mosopa that the police broke into the house, started searching and questioning everyone, then moved to search Badmus’s room and beat him up.</p>
      <p>He added that one of the police officials then fetched a plastic bag that was then wrapped around the deceased’s head, suffocating him to death.</p>
      <p>A paramedic that attended to the scene John Gous told the court that when medical officials arrived, the 25-year-old was unresponsive and sweaty with no pulse but there were no signs of physical injuries. He was declared dead on the spot.</p>
