      <h1>Newlywed left heartbroken after death of husband in drink-driving smash</h1>
      <h2>As part of the Sunday Mail Leave the Keys anti-drink driving campaign Julie Taylor recalls "every second" of horror crash that killed her husband.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>Julie Taylor can recall every second of the horrific moment <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">drunk driver</a> Russell McKeever’s Audi ploughed into her and husband Colin’s car.</p>
      <p>The impact was so loud that she thought there had been an explosion.</p>
      <p>The newlyweds were on their way to visit their granddaughter when businessman <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">McKeever</a> veered on to their side of the road and hit them head-on.</p>
      <p>Colin, 59, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">died</a> instantly but Julie remained conscious and lay trapped in the wreckage for 30 minutes next to her husband.</p>
      <p>Their terrier Kola, who was in the front passenger seat, was also killed by the smash on the A933, near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">Dundee</a>, in October 2014.</p>

      <p>Julie, who was in the back seat of their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">Citroen Picasso</a>, suffered life-changing injuries and is still on medication while she battles post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>She is in constant pain and has never been able to return to her career as a social worker.</p>
      <p>Julie, 54, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">Stonehaven</a>, Kincardineshire, said she and her three children Stephen, 36, David, 34, and Sarah, 31, will never recover from the loss of Colin.</p>
      <p>She added: “Colin and I had finished work early at 2pm and were going to see our three-year-old granddaughter in Arbroath to have a Halloween tea. It was about 3.15pm and McKeever came out of nowhere and hit us head-on.</p>
      <p>“I remember every single thing, even to this day. It was as if a bomb had gone off – it was that loud.</p>
      <p>“I knew straight away my husband was dead and it was a miracle that I was still alive.</p>
      <p>“There was a driver behind us who called an ambulance and the fire service cut me from the car.</p>
      <p>“I was there for quite a long time and all I could think of is, ‘My husband is dead and our children have lost their father.’”</p>
      <p>Julie has called for an increase in the penalties handed out to drunk drivers.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m disgusted that people are still <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">drinking and driving</a> and more offenders are being caught.</p>
      <p>“I think if you are caught you should get banned for at least three years. The automatic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">one-year ban</a> is clearly not enough of a deterrent.”</p>
      <p>McKeever, 43, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exasperated-cop-scots-island-issues-20849922">Dundee</a>, decided to get behind the wheel following a heavy lunchtime drinking session.</p>

      <p>After the crash, he told paramedics he had drunk “f***ing loads” after escaping with minor injuries.</p>
      <p>Four hours after the crash, McKeever gave an alcohol reading of 226. The then limit was 80.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to four years in jail at the High Court in Livingston in 2016 after admitting death by dangerous <br/>driving but has been freed.</p>
      <p>Julie added: “McKeever committed murder, as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
