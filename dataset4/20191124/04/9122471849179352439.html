      <h1>Video: Major Officiating Controversy At End Of Oklahoma-TCU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:24:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma escaped TCU this evening, as the Sooners were able to hold off the Horned Frogs in Norman, 28-24, to stay in the College Football Playoff hunt. The game was not without controversy, though.</p>
      <p>The Sooners secured their win on a “first down” rush by Jalen Hurts with about a minute to go in the game. Hurts, though, did not appear to actually get that first down.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma’s star quarterback appeared to come up well short of the first-down marker on his 3rd and 1 rush. There was a large pile near the line to gain, though, and the official probably didn’t have a great view of things. So, he marked Hurts at the first-down line.</p>
      <p>The play went to review, where there was nothing conclusive. The call stood.</p>
      <p>TCU head coach Gary Patterson (and the rest of the Horned Frogs) were not happy.</p>

      <p>It’s tough to not be furious if you’re a TCU fan right now. That was pretty brutal.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma was able to run out the clock with some kneels following the first down call. The Sooners improved to 10-1 with the win tonight.</p>
      <p>The Big 12 remains in the College Football Playoff hunt.</p>
