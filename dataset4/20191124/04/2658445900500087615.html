      <h3>Justina Asishana, Minna</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>THE Nigerian Society of Engineers has called for the re-introduction of the weigh balance bridges and implementation of maximum Axle load on highways across Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The engineers stated that this is the only panacea to the deteriorating state of the roads across Nigeria.</p>
      <p>This was the position of participants at the Engineer Abdukkadir Lapai Annual Lecture organised by the Minna branch of the Nigerian Society of Engineers in Niger State.</p>
      <p>Sunday Kolo of the Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Technology, Minna, in his lecture titled ‘Total quality control in the conception, construction and maintenance of roads in a developing economy’, said that the reintroduction of weighing machine at major strategic locations will monitor load capacity.</p>

      <p>He blamed the bad state of roads across the country on lack of monitoring and insisted vehicle with high capacities should not be allowed on some roads.</p>
      <p>“A well designed, well-constructed road will fail if the issue of Axle Law is not infused. There is need to reintroduce weigh balance and weigh bridge on the Nigerian roads.</p>
      <p>This will go a long way to maintain the road and maintain its long life,” he argued.</p>
      <p>The engineers then called on government to design and construct roads to all applicable standards stressing that agencies should be allowed to carry out their functions without interference,” he said.</p>
