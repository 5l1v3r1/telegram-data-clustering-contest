      <h1>Couple's never-ending nightmare after mum killed by drink driver on their wedding day</h1>
      <h2>As part of the Sunday Mail Leave the Keys anti-drink driving campaign Martin Colquhoun opens up on losing his mother Marie Laurie.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Hyland</a></address>
      <p>Martin Colquhoun was on such a high that he can’t even remember saying goodbye to his mum at the end of the happiest day of his life.</p>
      <p>He had just married Michelle in front of their closest friends and family.</p>
      <p>Like most newlyweds, they felt on top of the world as they looked forward to planning their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">future</a> together.</p>
      <p>But, within hours, that world – <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">their world</a> – was cruelly turned upside down and memories of the wedding cast to ashes.</p>
      <p>As Martin’s mum Marie Laurie made her way home in a taxi, drunk driver Steven Bennie smashed into the vehicle and killed her.</p>
      <p>Bennie had been trying to evade police and had been drink-driving at speeds of up to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">80mph</a> while uninsured and with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">no licence</a>.</p>

      <p>Marie, 57, of Easterhouse, Glasgow, lost consciousness minutes after being thrown through a window of the cab in the collision in November 2015.</p>
      <p>Speaking from his home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">Stewarton</a>, Ayrshire, Martin, 44, said: “Our wedding day was amazing but it went so quickly I can’t even remember the last thing I said to my mum. Michelle and I had no idea what had happened until the next day as Michelle’s bag had been mixed up with someone else’s.</p>
      <p>“We were coming down for breakfast when my cousin gave Michelle back her bag and said her phone hadn’t stopped ringing.</p>
      <p>“Moments before I’d been on a high. It was the day after my wedding and I was with my new wife.</p>
      <p>“Then Michelle handed me a phone and it was my uncle Robert, who said to me, ‘Your mum has been in an accident and she’s gone.’</p>
      <p>“Emotion took over. It was the world’s greatest high to the worst low. It was the last thing we ever expected.”</p>
      <p>Martin’s wife Michelle, 40, took the last picture of Marie with guests only hours before her <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">death</a>.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Marie, who had battled cancer after being diagnosed in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">2009</a>, and husband Jamie, 56, had posed for the picture before they left the wedding reception at the Lochside Hotel in Cumnock, Ayrshire, in a minibus. They were dropped off in Glasgow’s east end, where they then hailed a taxi in the street to take them the final leg of the journey.</p>
      <p>Marie had just entered the cab when the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">collision</a> happened.</p>

      <p>Emergency services attended but she died at the scene.</p>
      <p>Jamie was badly hurt in the crash and left devastated by the sudden loss of his wife of six years.</p>
      <p>Michelle, a nursery teacher, said: “For a long time after, I questioned myself and wondered if I hadn’t stopped them for a picture, then maybe they’d have got in another taxi and Marie would still be here.”</p>
      <p>Next week, the couple celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary. The anniversary of Marie’s death is the <br/>next day.</p>

      <p>Martin, who is dad to six-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">daughter</a>, Mollie, said: “I can’t think about my mum without thinking about my wedding and I can’t think about my wedding without thinking about my mum’s death. My mum had so much life to live and her family miss her. It isn’t just Christmas and birthdays, it’s the everyday little things that were stolen from her and from us.</p>
      <p>“Mollie was only two at the time – she doesn’t remember her gran.”</p>
      <p>Martin told how Marie’s loved ones were left shocked when the dangerous speed Bennie was driving at was revealed in court.</p>
      <p>Bennie, 24, pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was handed seven years and six months behind bars in October 2016.</p>
      <p>Martin added: “Bennie has ruined his own life and that of not only his family but ours.</p>
      <p>“When it came out in court that he had driven at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">80mph</a>, we all gasped.</p>
      <p>“He hung his head, as he should have, in shame.”</p>

      <p>Michelle was so desperate to help Martin find some peace that she contacted a psychic after Marie’s death.</p>
      <p>She said: “Martin just needed some closure and any sort of comfort.</p>
      <p>“One time, I ended up upset because at a reading the psychic said Marie had come through and kept saying sorry <br/>for her death happening just after our wedding.</p>
      <p>“There isn’t any final goodbye, though, and that is the biggest regret.”</p>
      <p>The couple said they were not shocked at new figures showing drink-driving had increased.</p>
      <p>Martin, a sales adviser for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-given-10000-fine-10-20848051">Sky</a>, added: “We know people still drink and drive because they’re selfish and don’t realise how many people their actions affect.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/drink-drive-disgrace-families-lost-20947089">“The figures have increased</a> but this has to stop.</p>
      <p>“We hope by sharing our story people will stop and think.</p>
      <p>“If you choose to drink and drive, it could be your mum next time, your sister or even you.”</p>
