      <h1>Scotland's top plastic surgeons go to court over cocaine slur</h1>
      <h2>Dr Ravichandran is alleged to have made a comment at an industry event indicating that Dr Darren McKeown had taken drugs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Blackstock</a></address>
      <p>Two of Scotland’s leading cosmetic clinic owners are involved in an extraordinary spat over an alleged <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs">drug</a> slur.</p>
      <p>Plastic surgeon Dr Darren ­McKeown has launched a legal action against fellow surgeon Dr Simon Ravichandran.</p>
      <p>The case centres on an alleged remark made at a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cosmetic-surgery">cosmetic ­industry</a> event in London last year.</p>
      <p>Dr Ravichandran – a specialist in ear, nose and throat surgery who quit the NHS for private work in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> – is claimed to have made a comment that Dr McKeown had taken cocaine.</p>
      <p>Dr McKeown, who has appeared in TV documentaries about his work, was angered and is now suing Dr Ravichandran at the Court of Session in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.</p>
      <p>Paperwork lodged at the ­country’s top civil court will claim his thriving cosmetic business, also in Glasgow, suffered as a result of the accusation.</p>
      <p>The case, due to begin on January 29, will hear claims that at least three people heard the allegation.</p>
      <p>But Dr Ravichandran, the ­president and founder of the ­Association of Scottish Aesthetic Practitioners, denies saying it.</p>
      <p>His legal team will argue that as well as being false, Dr McKeown has been unable to prove financial loss to his ­business and will claim the case shouldn’t be heard in ­Scotland because the incident is said to have happened in London.</p>
      <p>Dr McKeown, who has instructed MacRoberts Solicitors to handle the action, strenuously denies any involvement with drugs.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old often gives ­interviews about cosmetic surgery and discusses work celebrities have had done.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed he previously paid his personal assistant in expensive designer Louboutin shoes instead of money.</p>
      <p>In 2016, former Glasgow ­University student Dr McKeown, from Hamilton, personally injected over 3200 dermal fillers in a single year, making him the biggest user of the procedure in the country.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Dr McKeown, who runs Aesthetic Medicine ­Institute, refused to comment.</p>
      <p>Dr Ravichandran, 44, is also a prominent practitioner in ­Scotland’s cosmetic industry.</p>
      <p>He set up private clinic Clinetix in 2006 and continued to work for NHS Lanarkshire until 2016.</p>
      <p>When we contacted his clinic, a colleague said he was in Thailand and could not be reached.</p>
      <p>His solicitors BKF &amp; Co said: “The action is being defended.”</p>
