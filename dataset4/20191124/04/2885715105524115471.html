      </p>
      <p>At least 200 people crossing over from India have been arrested in the past few weeks from Bangladesh areas bordering West Bengal.

On Saturday, more than 55 alleged Bangladeshi nationals, including women and children, were brought to the Howrah Railway Station in Kolkata from Bengaluru, for deportation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>From being locked in a meeting with the Congress and Shiv Sena till late Friday evening, to taking oath with the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a>’s Devendra Fadnavis early Saturday morning, the dramatic turnaround showcased by NCP leader Ajit Pawar was helped by the use of a special Section in the Union government’s transaction of business rules. Rule 12 of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, allows for revocation of President’s Rule without Cabinet approval if the Prime Minister “deems it necessary”.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It saddens me that PM Modi has done nothing to change Lutyens Delhi. It remains the crucible of political power it has always been. But, there is now a new elite in residence whose supporters have turned the word Lutyens (Lootyens as they call it) into a term of abuse.

While his son Humayun brought a large number of Persian cooks, who imported into India a cuisine developed over centuries. Humayun’s son, Akbar, unlike his grandfather, developed an affinity for manners and customs of the country.</p>
