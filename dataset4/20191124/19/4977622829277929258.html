      <h1>Maharashtra BJP Launches ‘Operation Fadnavis-Pawar’ As Legislature Meet Resolves To Win Floor Test In Assembly </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:37:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>A meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party's legislators on Sunday (24 November) resolved to win the upcoming floor test in the Maharashtra Assembly with a thumping majority, a top party leader said.</p>
      <p>Former minister Ashish Shelar said that the party and legislators discussed the upcoming challenge to ensure victory for the newly-appointed Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>He reiterated how the Shiv Sena insulted the public mandate given to the BJP-led erstwhile 'Maha-Yuti', and has now changed track.</p>
      <p>"We have resolved to ensure a thumping majority on the floor test and ensure that the Fadnavis-Pawar government goes to its full term for the welfare of the people of Maharashtra," Shelar said.</p>
      <p>The meeting was attended by CM Fadnavis, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil, former chief minister Narayan Rane, ex-ministers, party leaders, and others.</p>
      <p>To a question whether the BJP had launched an 'Operation <i>Kamal</i>' to break the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress legislators, he shot back saying in Maharashtra there's only "Operation Fadnavis-Pawar" for their full five-year term of the government.</p>
      <p>The meeting also passed a resolution congratulating both Fadnavis and Pawar for taking over their responsibilities early on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Barring a few, a majority of the BJP's 105 legislators were present and those who were absent had cited valid reasons to the party leadership, he clarified.</p>
      <p>This was the first formal meeting of the BJP after the Fadnavis-Pawar duo was sworn-in early on Saturday, triggering off a major political crisis.</p>
