However, he did assure Warne, that he would talk to everyone concerned.</p>
                            <p><i>“I am sure he has got a hint by what he has seen in this game but it’s a decision everyone has to take and let’s see how it goes,</i>” Sourav replied while addressing the media after India’s win at Eden Gardens.</p>
