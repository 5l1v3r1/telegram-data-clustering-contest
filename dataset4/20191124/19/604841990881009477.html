      <p>Eureka Secondary School Kells student, Aoife Murphy, has been named winner of the Navan Rotary Club Youth Leadership Competition 2019. There were 10 students in all who participated in the competition from five secondary schools in the area. The other school winners were Ailbhe O’Brien and Jodie Everard- Joint winner (St Michael’s Loreto), James Cahill (St Patrick’s Classical School), Charlotte Dillon (Dunshaughlin Community School) and Kira O’Kane (Colàiste na Mí).</p>
      <p>The motto of Rotary, which is an international organisation, is 'Service before Self' the objective to collectively work together to create a lasting positive change to the lives of those less fortunate than ourselves. The work of Rotary and the action of leadership are therefore indispensable to each other.</p>
      <p>Aoife demonstrated initiative and leadership within her school and her local community, indicating a willingness to provide service above self and an eagerness to engage in projects towards positive change locally and nationally.</p>
      <p>The Youth Leadership Competition (YLC) is one of the biggest and most rewarding projects undertaken by the Rotary Club of Navan. This competition is unique as it encourages young people to think about who they are, what they are good at and what they would like to do, thus enabling them to examine a potential plan for their future.</p>
      <p>The YLC primarily increases the awareness of and understanding leadership at a young age, and is a valuable platform from which young people can develop their knowledge of leadership and progress to being potentially great leaders of our country and indeed the world…. understanding what it takes to be a good leader.</p>
      <p>This is the first time a student from Eureka Secondary School is the Rotary Youth Leadership Club Winner, which is remarkable as this coincides with Eureka embarking on its first year in the brand-new state of the art secondary school. This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the Rotary Club of Navan.</p>
      <p>Aoife was presented with the Tony Rowntree Memorial Shield, which displays all previous winners since its inception in 2005, in remembrance of former Rotarian Tony Rowntree. Aoife was also presented with a cheque generously donated by the Navan Credit Union Plus. The other school winners also received a cheque each donated by Navan Credit Union Plus.</p>
