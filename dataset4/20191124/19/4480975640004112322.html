      <h1>Chart of the week in Analysis: AUD/JPY at a critical juncture</h1>

          <b>AUD/JPY is a compelling case for a test of trendline support.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Upside targets include the 200-DMA and July highs. </b>

      <p>Considering the fundamental backdrop, as explained in full here, <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/asia-open-recap-of-latest-developments-as-risk-on-tones-emerge-201911241816">Asia open: Recap of latest developments as risk-on tones emerge</a></b> and here, <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/what-you-need-to-know-before-markets-open-eyes-on-usd-jpy-test-below-trend-line-support-201911241911">What you need to know before markets open: Eyes on USD/JPY test below trend-line support</a></b>, AUD/JPY brings in a compelling technical story that has something for both the bears and the bulls at the start of this week. </p>
      <p>AUD/JPY is an eye-catcher for the start of this week. The market's risk-barometer is technically running out of juice on the downside, as signified by MACD and a lack of conviction from the bears as signified by the indecisiveness on the last daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart/candlestick-patterns">candlestick</a> and price action since the 14th Nov. lows. </p>
      <h3>Bears look for initial 'fakeout'</h3>
      <p>Trendline support is being respected at this juncture where the price meets the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 26th Aug. - 7th Nov. range. However, it would not be uncommon for a test below the trendline at this juncture which would bring in 73 the figure prior to a re-run to the upside and prior trendline support level again. A high conviction trade, subsequently, could be if the price were to break the 73 handle on a second attempt, bears will be looking down the barrel to the October lows as a target at 71.73. However, the 61.8% Fibonacci would be an obstacle around 72.20 guarding a highly congested range between there and a figure lower to the 78.6% Fibo/ located around 71.20. </p>
      <h3>Upside targets</h3>
      <p>On the flip side, bulls need a break above the 21-day moving average ad then a close or two through and beyond the 13th Sep. swing highs located at 74.49 with a confluence of the 23.6% Fibo of the aforementioned rage. The 200-day moving average is located at the latest swing highs of 75.67. A break of the July-Aug congestion/resistance of 76.28 opens risk fo 77.40, (Feb spike lows) ahead of 78.50 26th Oct 18 lows. </p>
