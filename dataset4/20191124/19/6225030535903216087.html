      <p>Mondayâ€™s 7th race from Mahoning Valley is the $250,000 Steel Valley Sprint Stakes for 3-year-olds dashing six furlongs on the main track (Post Time 3:33 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#5 MANNY WAH (8-1) turned back and smartly captured an optional claiming sprint at this distance Sept. 27. He should sit a nice trip behind the speed at square odds.</p>
      <p>#1 Bourbon Calling (4-1) exits back-to-back dirt sprint wins from off the pace. He almost always finishes in the top three at this distance and should get pace to chase.</p>
      <p>#2 Call Paul (5-2) is a talented PA-bred dirt sprinter with early-pressing versatility. The consistent colt looks like a solid contender at low odds.</p>
      <p>#12 Preamble (5-1) won his first three starts before throwing in a clunker as the chalk in the Chick Lang (G3) May 18. He drilled a Keeneland bullet for this Nov. 18 and figures to chase the pace from the outside post.</p>
