      <h1>Why sex workers in Merseyside are criminalised, but punters often avoid arrest</h1>
      <h2>The scale of arrests made in five years has been revealed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-tobin/" target="_blank">Olivia Tobin</a></address>
      <p>The scale of how sex work is criminalised in Merseyside has been laid bare as new figures reveal how many people have been arrested.</p>
      <p>Data released to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request shows the number of sex workers getting arrested is rising - but the number of punter arrests remains low.</p>
      <p>Only a fraction of people have been arrested for "soliciting the purposes of sex", meaning the sex worker is the one who has been treated as a criminal.</p>
      <p>Data has also revealed how, sickeningly, people were arrested on suspicion of paying for or arranging sex with a child aged 13 to 15.</p>
      <p>The NSPCC said child exploitation causes "unthinkable pain".</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Rhodes said the force "works with other agencies to support sex workers by offering advice and also by looking to give conditional cautions rather than charge sex workers, so they were supported and not criminalised."</p>
      <p>In five years 40 people have been arrested on suspicion of "loitering for the purposes of prostitution".</p>

        <figcaption>There were 131 arrests made in give years for a wide range of offences<cite>(Image: Reach PLC)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But less than a quarter have been arrested for soliciting for the purposes of prostitution, with only nine arrests being made in the same time frame.</p>
      <p>And only 13 have been arrested for "soliciting another for the purposes of obtaining their sexual service".  </p>
      <p>Overall, more women have been arrested too.</p>
      <p>In five years, 54% of those arrested for different offences were women, with a sharp peak in 2018 as 30 were held.</p>
      <p>For the same year, nine men were arersted.</p>
      <p>Data also revealed shocking details about how many people in Merseyside have been arrested on suspicion of arranging sexual abuse of a child.</p>
      <p>Thirty-five people were arrested for a litany of sick crimes, including arranging for a child to be exploited, controlling a child for sexual exploitation and paying for the sexual services of a child.</p>
      <p>Four children were also arrested, figures showed, although it is not known what for.</p>

      <p>Helen Westerman, head of safeguarding in communities for the NSPCC, said: “Child sexual exploitation is an evil crime that can destroy childhoods and cause unthinkable pain.</p>
      <p>“We know from contacts to Childline that victims are often manipulated or blackmailed into carrying out sexual acts, damaging their mental health and leaving them feeling isolated from the people closest to them.</p>
      <p>"Some turn to self-harm, alcohol or substance misuse as ways of coping with their experiences.</p>
      <h3>Top five locations for prostitution arrests</h3>
      <p>A huge 44% of these arrests took place in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/kensington">Kensington</a>, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/fairfield">Fairfield</a>, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tuebrook">Tuebrook</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/old-swan">Old Swan</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/tragic-history-homeless-sex-worker-16011012">the ECHO reported sex worker Natalie Richards was banned from the notorious Shiel Road area</a> after she was handed a criminal behaviour order.</p>

        <figcaption>Natalie Richards began working on Shiel Road to fund her crack cocaine habit</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She was charged with being a person persistently loitering for the purposes of prostitution, as well as for possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old's fate was shown on BBC documentary, Sex Map of Britain, which aired in September 2017.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the show, Natalie said: "It's alright for men, they can go graft, rob shops, whatever."</p>
      <p>"But us women, we've got to go and sell our bodies for our habit, it's horrible."</p>
      <p>If people are charged on multiple occasions, they may receive a fine or anti-social behaviour order, like Natalie did.</p>
      <p>DCI Rhodes said: “Merseyside Police has a victim focused approach to better support sex workers who are at risk, both on the street and online, and we do this by focusing on safety and not enforcement.</p>
      <p>"Our Red Umbrella project is an innovative project to support sex workers on Merseyside. This is the first time a dedicated Police Sex Worker Liaison Officer has been appointed to help sex workers.</p>

        <figcaption>Police said it considers crimes against sex workers a hate crime</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“However, we balance this approach by ensuring that community concerns are listened to and acted upon. During late 2018-19, Operation Longmont was a temporary local policing response to concerns from the community about sex workers around Shiel Road.<br/><br/>"Along with our Red Umbrella project, we worked with other agencies to support sex workers by offering advice and also by looking to give conditional cautions rather than charge sex workers, so they were supported and not criminalised. Because of this operation our numbers rose whereas normally they are low figures for loitering, and are again decreasing this year, as this operation is not a permanent tactic.<br/><br/>“We consider crimes against sex workers as a hate crime. If people are being targeted because they are perceived to be different then we want them to come forward and tell us, rather than suffer in silence. We want sex workers to report crimes against them as they are entitled to be safe just like everyone else. The more action we can take against perpetrators, the more confidence we can instil in victims that if they report things to the police we will protect and support them.</p>
      <p>“As a force we have a progressive stance, which has influenced national policy and by having a dedicated sex work liaison officer, those who report crimes or wish to speak an officer for advice have a consistent point of contact.”</p>
      <p>Ms Westerman added: “The NSPCC works continuously with authorities, schools and families across Liverpool, Merseyside and around the UK to help prevent these vile crimes, and help victims overcome the trauma they can cause.”</p>
