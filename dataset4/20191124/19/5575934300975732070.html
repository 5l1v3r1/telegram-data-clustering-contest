        <li>Giuliani wrote on Twitter that it was a “sarcastic” term, but he did in fact have potentially compromising “files” he had in a safe concerning former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.</li>
        <li>The former prosecutor has been at the centre of several State Department officials and House lawmakers’ concerns over the course of the impeachment inquiry related to his contact with Ukrainian officials.</li>

      <p>Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, shed light on his repeated mentions of an<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-insurance-loyal">“insurance policy”</a> in case the president turned on him for his dealings in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Giuliani posted on Twitter Saturday to say that the claim was “sarcastic” but referred to potentially compromising “files” he had in a safe concerning former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.</p>
      <p>“The statement I’ve made several times of having an insurance policy, if thrown under bus, is sarcastic &amp; relates to the files in my safe about the Biden Family’s 4 decade monetising of his office,” he wrote. “If I disappear, it will appear immediately along with my RICO chart.”</p>

      <p>Giuliani’s mention of a “RICO chart” refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act, which is the federal law aimed at prosecuting organised crime, and could mean the former US Attorney still has information that’s not been released publicly from his time in the role, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-23/giuliani-says-biden-documents-to-be-released-if-i-disappear">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>He did not provide any more detail about what the documents might contain.</p>
      <p>Giuliani has also dismissed questions about the possibility Trump might turn on him after the former prosecutor has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-documents-show-contacts-between-rudy-giuliani-and-mike-pompeo-2019-11-23/">been at the centre</a> of state Department officials and House lawmakers’ concerns over Trump’s possible pressure on and withholding of military aid to Ukraine while he allegedly pushed officials to investigate the Bidens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/771849041/how-a-complicated-web-connects-2-soviet-born-businessmen-with-the-impeachment-in">Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman</a>, two of Giuliani’s associates, were arrested on charges of conspiracy, making false statements, and falsification of records after playing key roles in Giuliani’s push for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most damning testimony in recent weeks was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-pompeo-oval-office-rudy-giuliani-marie-yovanovitch-documents-2019-11">related to former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch</a>, who earned a reputation for her anti-corruption efforts while on the job, but told Congress that she was a target of a “smear campaign” by Giuliani and Trump and she felt “‘kneecapped’ by Americans who allied themselves with corrupt Ukrainian interests,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/15/trump-yovanovitch-impeachment-070988">according to Politico.</a></p>
