      <p>Movember-style male health campaigns are failing to make men take their wellbeing seriously, as nearly half still resist going to the doctor, new research suggests.</p>
      <p>The arrival of November traditionally sees social media flooded with pictures of men with specially grown moustaches as part of a drive to raise awareness of male health issues.</p>
      <p>However, despite the campaign raising £10 million in the UK last year, a survey by Bupa has found a large proportion of the male population are still worryingly cavalier about health.</p>
      <p>The health provider found 48% of the 2,000 men interviewed would only seek medical health if they absolutely had to, despite warnings that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/international-mens-day-2018-shocking-statistics-need-know/">such an attitude could prove fatal.</a> </p>
      <p>Nearly half of men admitted keeping health problems to themselves, while 45% said they had previously hoped the issue would simply “go away”.</p>
      <p>Eight out of 10 men would similarly choose to endure an illness or ailment rather than seeking health, Bupa found, suggesting this approach was “the norm”. </p>
      <p>Perhaps most alarmingly, 39% of men would let symptoms get to the point where the pain was unbearable before they chose to make an appointment with their GP. </p>
      <p>“Although campaigns such as Movember are doing a brilliant job at raising awareness and tackling the stigma around men’s health, it is clear from our research that men are still struggling to open up about their health,” said Dr Naveen Puri, a lead physician at Bupa Health Clinics.</p>
      <p>“For many men, visiting the doctor about a health issue is still intimidating and they often put it off until their condition becomes worse.</p>
      <p>"It is clear there is still work needed to be done to encourage men to feel comfortable speaking up about their health.”</p>

      <p>It is feared the reluctance of many men to visit the doctor may lead to serious and potentially fatal conditions going undiagnosed until it is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/forgotten-sex-mens-health-ignored-policy-makers/">too late to treat them effectively.</a> </p>
      <p>Paul Mitcheson, global director of cause and brand at Movember, said: “Health doesn’t sit highly on the priority list for most men, at least until their later years or until a problem has become really serious.</p>
      <p>"In addition, a lot of men believe that it’s not ‘manly’ to talk about health issues, they ignore symptoms and don’t take action until it’s too late.</p>
      <p>“Movember’s annual fundraising and awareness campaign encourages men to understand that physical and mental health issues can happen to anyone, and are not a sign of weakness. We want men to know there is bravery in taking action for both your physical and mental health.”</p>
