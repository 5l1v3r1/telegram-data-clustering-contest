      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/south-korea">South Korean</a> singer and actress Goo Hara has been found dead at her home in Seoul on Sunday, according to Gangnam police who are investigating the cause of death. She was 28.</p>
      <p>Hara was internationally known for being a founding member of the K-Pop group Kara, which had a big following in South Korea, Japan, and other <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia">Asian</a> countries. She also appeared on television and released a solo album, titled "Alohara," which peaked at No. 4 in the country.</p>
      <p>Her death came six months after her manager found her unconscious following a reported suicide attempt in her home, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3038700/k-pop-star-goo-hara-makes-comeback-after-apparent-suicide">South China Morning Post</a> reported.</p>

      <p>The singer apologized for causing "concerns and a commotion" after the reported attempt in May and months later it seemed like she was making efforts in recovery -- following a number of comeback performances last week, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50535937">BBC</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Hara signed with a Japanese management agency, Production Ogi, over the summer and released a song titled "Midnight Queen" earlier this month.</p>
      <p>She was planning on touring the cities of Fukuoka, Nagoya, Osaka and Toyko to promote it, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/arts/goo-hara-dead.html">reported</a>.</p>

      <p>Her final post on Instagram was a photo of Hara under the covers in bed with the caption "Good night," which was shared with her 1.6 million followers.</p>
      <p>She was embroiled last year in public disputes with an ex-boyfriend who claimed she assaulted him. Hara accused the man of having threatened to circulate a sex video of her. The case made her the subject of tabloid fodder and malicious online messages.</p>

      <p>In October, another K-pop star and actress, Sulli, was found dead at her home near Seoul. Hara said the two were "like sisters."</p>

      <p>Sulli, 25, was known for her feminist voice and outspokenness that was rare in conservative South Korea. Before her death, she appeared in a TV show and spoke out against online backlash she received over her lifestyle.</p>
      <p>The pop star was born in Gwangju on January 13, 1991. Her <a href="http://k-fan.official-fan.com/hara-tour2019/">official fan website</a> listed photography, reading, and exercise as her hobbies, while adding that driving was her specialty.</p>
