      <p>Scoring his fourth consecutive victory, even-money favored <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Fashionably_Fast">Fashionably Fast</a> </b>resisted the stretch challenge of Oliver to register a half-length triumph in the featured $100,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Cary_Grant_Stakes">Cary Grant Stakes</a></b> Sunday at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>Always prominent under regular pilot Tiago Pereira, Fashionably Fast took the lead in upper stretch and prevailed gamely in 1:22.13 for the seven furlongs. Oliver, the lone three-year-old in a field of five older California-bred runners, was a clear second, a length and one-half ahead of third-place Ultimate Bango.</p>

      <p>“I thought I’d be laying about third," Perriera said. "I thought the 5 (Oliver) would go. But we came out of there really well and he’s plenty fast and he went to the front. Then he was running so easy I wasn’t going to take him back. I just let him go. I know this horse (he’s ridden him in nine of his last 10 starts) and I know how good he can be. Four in a row. That’s good.”</p>
      <p>Fashionably Fast, a four-year-old gelded son of Lucky Pulpit, was bred by the Harris Farms of John Harris who co-owns the horse with partners Per Antonsen and Paul Nicoletti. Dean Pederson is the trainer</p>
      <p>Fashionably Fast was a two-time winner last summer at Del Mar and in October won the Harris Farms Stakes at the Fresno Fair.</p>
      <p>“Him maturing quite a bit has played a big roll (in his four straight wins), and obviously taking the blinkers off has helped," Pederson said. "It helps him feel a little more relaxed in his running style. He’s a handy horse you can place where you want to and he has been a godsend to us. He has been a remarkable horse over a short period of time for us.</p>
      <p>Fashionably Fast returned $4.20, $2.40 and $2.10 to his backers Sunday and first money of $60,000 increased his earnings to $302,745. It was his fifth win in 14 career starts. Runner-up Oliver paid $3 and $2.20, while Ultimate Bango returned $2.40 to show.</p>
      <p>There were no perfect tickets in the Pick Six Sunday, so a carryover of $51,254 will be in effect when racing resumes Friday with a first post of 12:30 p.m.</p>
