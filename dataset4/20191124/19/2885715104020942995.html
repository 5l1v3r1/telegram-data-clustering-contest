      <h1>Serie A: Chris Smalling scores 1 and sets up 2 as Roma defeat Brescia 3-0</h1>
      <h2>AS Roma moved up to fourth, one point ahead of Cagliari, which was visiting Lecce later.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:55:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/ap/" target="_blank">AP</a></address>
      <p>Chris Smalling’s transfer fee is rising match by match.</p>
      <p>The former England international scored one goal and set up two others in Roma’s 3-0 win over last-place Brescia in Serie A on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Smalling is on loan from Manchester United, which as of last week was reportedly seeking a fee of 20 million euros ($22 million) from Roma if the Giallorossi want to acquire his full rights.</p>
      <p>Smalling has been on form all season for Roma and was particularly sharp in his latest performance.</p>
      <p>In a 20-minute span of the second half, Smalling first scored with a header then knocked down crosses to set up goals for central defense partner Gianluca Mancini and forward Edin Džeko.</p>
      <p>Roma moved up to fourth, one point ahead of Cagliari, which was visiting Lecce later.</p>
      <p>Mario Balotelli was left out of Brescia’s squad following a training ground dispute with coach Fabio Grosso.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LAZIO 3rd</b>
      </p>
      <p>City rival Lazio is two points ahead of Roma in third following a 2-1 victory at Sassuolo courtesy of a late winner from Felipe Caicedo.</p>
      <p>Ciro Immobile had opened the scoring with his 82nd career Serie A goal for Lazio, placing him level third with Tommaso Rocchi on the club’s all-time list behind Silvio Piola (143 goals) and Giuseppe Signori (107).</p>
      <p>Francesco Caputo equalized for Sassuolo before the break.</p>
      <p>
        <b>OTHER RESULTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>A last-second equalizer from Blerim Dzemaili earned Bologna a 2-2 draw with Parma in an Emilia-Romagna derby.</p>
      <p>Dzemaili connected on a volley following a corner.</p>
      <p>Also, Samuel Di Carmine scored for Hellas Verona in a 1-0 win over Fiorentina.</p>
