      <p>Two French environmental NGOs and a union group on Sunday slammed the environmental impact of Amazon, vowing to disrupt its "Black Friday" sale campaign later this week.</p>
      <p>The NGOs Attac and les Amis de la Terre, as well as the Solidaires association of unions, said in a report that the "world according to Amazon is not sustainable".</p>
      <p>But Amazon said in a statement to AFP that it rejected the "erroneous" information put forward by the groups, saying their report contained numerous factual errors and speculation lacking foundation.</p>
      <p>The three groups pledged to turn the upcoming Black Friday on November 29 into a "Black Day for Amazon" by staging dozens of demonstrations across France to protest the policies of the company.</p>
      <p>There were no details on the nature of the demos but Attac has in the past staged unannounced protests outside Amazon facilities.</p>
      <p>Their statement accused Amazon of increasing greenhouse gas emissions through rapid delivery services, of destroying unsold products and showing a lack of transparency in its carbon budget.</p>
      <p>Putting together information from all the three groups, it accused Amazon of being responsible for 55.8 million tonnes of <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/greenhouse+gas+emissions/">greenhouse gas emissions</a>, the equivalent of all the emissions of Portugal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the report claimed that Amazon's practices involved "considerable waste", with some three million new products destroyed by Amazon in France alone in 2018.</p>
      <p>It also charged that Amazon worldwide hired people on insecure, short term contracts, meaning that "for every job created by Amazon, two are destroyed".</p>
      <p>The groups also accused Amazonâ€”which has its European headquarters in Luxembourg, of tax avoidance, an issue which has already seen the company in the crosshairs of the French authorities.</p>
      <p>The report alleged Amazon hid 57 percent of its sales in France, a charge denied by the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/company/">company</a>.</p>
      <p>The French parliament earlier this year defied US anger to pass a law taxing companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook or Apple for revenues accrued in the country, even if they are not based there.</p>
