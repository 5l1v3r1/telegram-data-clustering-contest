      <p>Despite having only turned 17 years of age earlier this month, the midfielder has established himself as a first-team regular at the Ligue 1 outfit.</p>
      <p>However, the prospect's emergence has inevitably led to widespread attention in his signature, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> said to be among the clubs monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p>According to <i>L'Equipe</i>, Rennes have placed a firm valuation on the teenager's services should they receive any offers during the January window.</p>
      <p>While Camavinga still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, there is seemingly an acceptance from Rennes that they must be realistic regarding any potential sale.</p>
      <p>The France Under-21 international has made 16 appearances in all competitions this season.</p>
