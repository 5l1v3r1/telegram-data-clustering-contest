      <p>In one clip, a blindfolded fan wearing an Odell Beckham jersey is trying to hit the piñata while another fan in a Myles Garrett jersey moves the piñata around.</p>

      <p>The crowd cheers, throws yellow penalty flags and attempts to guide her verbally as she misses repeatedly.</p>
      <p>The raucous scene appears to have taken place during a Cleveland tailgate Sunday before the Browns hosted the Dolphins.</p>
      <p>The distasteful showing comes after the Nov. 14 Browns-Steelers brawl during which Garrett removed Rudolph’s helmet and hit him with it.</p>
      <p>Thirty-three players were punished by the league, including Garrett, who was suspended indefinitely for his role in the melee.</p>
      <p>The suspension was upheld by the NFL on Thursday after the 23-year old defensive end appealed the ruling.</p>
