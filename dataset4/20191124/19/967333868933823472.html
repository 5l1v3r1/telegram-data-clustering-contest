        <b>TEL AVIV (Sputnik) - Israel is working on new technology to fend off the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday in the wake of a reported drone launch from the Gaza Strip.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"This [UAV] is a new, developing and significant threat. We are developing technological and other tools to defeat and counter this threat. I have assigned this mission to the Chairman of the National Security Council together with the various arms of the security agencies", Netanyahu said, as quoted by his press service.</blockquote>
      <p>He expressed belief that Israel would manage to develop such technology, which would be "the best in the world" to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911161077325278-Hamas-Gaza-Israel-war/">ensure "maximum defence" for its citizens</a>.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu said at a weekly cabinet meeting that Israel shot down a UAV, launched from Gaza on Saturday. Earlier, the Israel Defence Forces confirmed that it had intercepted a drone.</p>
      <p>The reported UAV launch from Gaza followed last week's escalation in border tensions triggered by Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Atta, a top commander from Palestine's Islamic Jihad group in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian militants fired multiple rockets toward Israel, while the latter responded with aerial attacks.</p>
