      <h1>GOP senator blasted for floating Ukraine hacking theory on Fox News</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:13:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Tim O'Donnell</a></address>
      <p>Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) on Sunday <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/471825-kennedy-on-whether-ukraine-interfered-in-2016-i-dont-know-nor-do">told</a> host Chris Wallace during an appearance on <i>Fox News Sunday</i> that he doesn't know if it was Russia or Ukraine who hacked the Democratic National Committee's server in 2016. "Nor do you, nor do any of us," Kennedy <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/471825-kennedy-on-whether-ukraine-interfered-in-2016-i-dont-know-nor-do">said</a>.</p>
      <p>Wallace <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/471825-kennedy-on-whether-ukraine-interfered-in-2016-i-dont-know-nor-do">countered</a> that the U.S. intelligence community stands behind the assertion that it was Russia, but Kennedy apparently doesn't think that's enough and continued to give a platform to the theory that it was Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/471825-kennedy-on-whether-ukraine-interfered-in-2016-i-dont-know-nor-do">dismissed </a>the notion during her impeachment inquiry testimony Friday, calling it a "fictional narrative." Kennedy told Wallace that Hill is entitled to her opinion, but cited the fact that "no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered" during the impeachment process.</p>

      <p>Kennedy was criticized for giving credence to the theory, for which there is currently no supporting evidence.</p>
