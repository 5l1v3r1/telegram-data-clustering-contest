      <p>Three persons, including a former home guard, were arrested by the Local Crime Branch of Ahmedabad Sunday for the alleged loot of around 1.8 kg gold ornaments worth Rs 63 lakh.</p>
      <p>According to police, the three accused looted the gold ornaments from two city-based persons on Anjali bridge in Vasna area of Ahmedabad on last Thursday. The accused have been identified as Ghanshyam Shrim-an, Ahmed Pathan and Iqbal Sheikh. All are residents of Ahmedabad.</p>
      <p>BV Gohil, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said, “On November 21 midnight, Ghanshyam, a former home guard, was with his friend Kamruddin Shiekh in an autorickshaw near Shastri bridge police outpost when he received information about two persons who were intercepted with 1,841.280 gm gold ornaments. The two men, Naveen Sanghvi and Bipin, informed the police that the ornaments belong to Seth Mahaveer, a businessman. They also asked their acquaintance Ramesh bhai to reach the outpost to confirm their version.”</p>
      <p>“After police questioning, Naveen and Ramesh left with the gold ornaments on a two-wheeler, whereas Bipin took an autorickshaw. Ghanshyam asked his friend Kamruddin to inform the other two accused, Ahmed and Iqbal over phone about Naveen and Ramesh. As soon as the two reached Anjali bridge in Vasna, their two-wheeler was intercepted by Ahmed and Iqbal and the gold was looted,” Gohil said.</p>
