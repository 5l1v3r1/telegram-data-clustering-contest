      <p><b>Mexico City:</b> Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has asked US legislators not to entangle internal political issues with the ratification of a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement. “We ask legislators from the two parties (Republicans and Democrats), with all due respect, to help us and not mix an electoral political issue with the approval of the treaty,” the President said on Friday, Xinhua news agency reported. “As to the treaty, I believe it has a consensus or greater acceptance among the people of the three nations,” he added, referring to Canada, the US, and Mexico. Lopez Obrador said that the Mexico-US-Canada Treaty (T-MEC) must not be held hostage to political differences, as this does not benefit the economic development of the region. (IANS)</p>
