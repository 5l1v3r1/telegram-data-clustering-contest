      <p>At least three people have been killed in France and a landslide collapsed a stretch of elevated road in Italy, leaving cars perched perilously on a precipice, as heavy rains pounded the region over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The rain trapped travellers, downed trees and unleashed mudslides, and triggered floods in parts of both countries.</p>
      <p>A 30-metre section of road along a viaduct near the flooded Italian coastal city of Savona collapsed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In an aerial video taken by firefighters, cars and a lorry could be seen stopped perilously close to the point where the raised part of the A6 road plunged on to a wooded area of the Liguria region.</p>
      <p>A man from one of the cars closest to the precipice stood outside his vehicle, holding up his arms towards other traffic to make sure drivers stopped.</p>
      <p>Liguria governor Giovanni Toti said a landslide caused the collapse in a muddy, hilly area.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were using dogs to sniff out any possible victims in 2m debris of mud, Toti said.</p>
      <p>It was not known if any vehicles might have plunged off the road, which is supported by pillars at that point.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in northern Italy, a woman was found dead after the surging Bomida river swept away her car.</p>
      <p>Flooding in Turin, northwest Italy, prompted cancellation of a marathon. In France, the Nice airport was briefly closed on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Rivers leading from the Alps to the French Riviera broke their banks, and sirens rang out in resort towns.</p>
      <p>A rescue boat sank while taking three people to shore near the French town of Muy, and one of them died, the Var regional administration said.</p>
      <p>Another person was found dead in a car in the town of Cabasse.</p>
      <p>French authorities are searching for two people missing in the floods, Nice mayor Christian Estrosi said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rain-swollen rivers and flooded streets plagued Italy, where it has been raining, sometimes heavily, in much of the country nearly every day for about two weeks.</p>
      <p>In Turin, the Po River overran its banks and flooded the medieval quarter and a popular riverside strolling area known as the Murazzi.</p>
      <p>About 150 people were evacuated from their homes in Liguria, Italy's hilly northwest coastal region.</p>
      <p>In Genoa, the charming neighbourhood of Boccadasse, a former fishing village with pastel-painted houses, was flooded after the sea rushed over retaining walls and on to the seaside road.</p>
      <p>Venice was partially flooded, but the high tide's level of nearly 1.3m in late morning was not unusual.</p>
      <p>In addition to the two dead in France, rescuers are searching for at least four others, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said after visiting the area on Sunday. He said more than 1600 people have been evacuated.</p>
      <p>French national weather service Meteo France said the area absorbed the equivalent of two months of average rainfall in 24 hours.</p>
