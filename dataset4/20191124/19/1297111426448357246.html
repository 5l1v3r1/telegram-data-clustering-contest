      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:58:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>For the first time this season, the Regina Pats are proud owners of a WHL winning streak.</p>
      <p>Regina posted its second consecutive victory on Saturday night with a 5-4 decision over the rival Brandon Wheat Kings before 3,749 fans at Westoba Place.</p>
      <p>It was the fourth game in five nights for the Pats (5-14-2-0), who were <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-erupt-for-blowout-win-over-swift-current-broncos">coming off a 6-0 blowout victory over the Swift Current Broncos on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>Both wins came on the road.</p>
      <p>“We scored (some goals) and our goaltenders both nights were good,” said head coach Dave Struch. “They were good all four games this week. We could say we deserved four wins. We played really good against Calgary (in a 4-2 loss). They’re a good team. Brandon is a good team. Our guys did a good job without the puck to get the puck to create offence and score the goals. Max was fantastic (on Friday) and (Donovan) Buskey was great tonight.”</p>
      <p>Brandon’s Ben McCartney opened the scoring just 1:03 into Saturday’s contest but Riley Krane responded to make it 1-1 after 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The home team regained the lead midway through the second period with a goal by Lynden McCallum. Carter Chorney tied it up 1:55 later and Carson Denomie added another power-play marker just 30 seconds into the third to give Regina a 3-2 lead.</p>
      <p>Robbie Holmes — fresh off a hat trick in Friday’s win over Swift Current — made it 4-2 just 3:09 later. After Jonny Lambos got one back for the Wheat Kings, Kyle Walker restored the two-goal lead with 3:06 left in regulation.</p>
      <p>Brandon’s Braden Schneider added a short-handed goal with 43 seconds on the clock but Regina held on from there.</p>
      <p>Goaltender Donovan Buskey — making his first appearance of the season — picked up his first victory for the Pats, who outshot Brandon 37-31.</p>
      <p>Jiri Patera took the loss for the Wheat Kings (11-14-1-0).</p>
      <p>Regina went 2-for-4 on the power play, improving to 5-for-10 over the past two games. That was preceded by an 0-for-16 streak.</p>
      <p>Players like Denomie and Chorney — both of whom are recent trade pickups — have provided a boost to the unit. However, the biggest change has simply been the players’ execution.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done it a couple of different ways over the past few months,” Struch explained. “We’e seen it work for two, three games and then we’ve seen it not work so we change it up. It seems to be working (now).</p>
      <p>“Being hungry around the net (helps). To get the puck to the paint, there’s a little bit more that needs to be done. That’s the extra they’re giving right now in the paint and fighting for those pucks. Last night in Swift Current we scored six goals within 10 feet of the paint so those are real keys.</p>
      <p>“We obviously hope it continues.”</p>
      <p><b>EXTRAS</b>: The Pats were without F Cole Dubinsky and F Carter Massier due to undisclosed injuries. Dubinsky, who has missed three straight games, has a chance to return Wednesday against the Lethbridge Hurricanes. Massier, who was hurt Friday in Swift Current, is out indefinitely … Regina will play four games in five days on an Alberta road trip, beginning Wednesday in Lethbridge.</p>
