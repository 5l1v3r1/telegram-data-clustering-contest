        <b>His participation is specifically a stand against Donald Trump</b>
      </p>
      <p>After much deliberation, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has announced he is officially running for president.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old billionaire has been mulling the idea back and forth for quite some time. It was only back in March he said he would not make a 2020 run for the White House.</p>
      <p>However, the tides have changed, with Bloomberg hitting out at the Donald, saying he is specifically running for president to defeat Trump and "rebuild America".</p>

      <p>In a statement he said:</p>
      <p>"I'm running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions.</p>
      <p>"He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who is joining the presidential race late, joins 18 other Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>Contenders include former vice-president Joe Biden, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders  who failed to gain enough votes back in 2016.</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg, ranked as the eight-richest American by Forbes, has a distinct advantage of being able to pour millions into his presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>It is unclear just how much money he will put into his campaign, but, senior adviser, Howard Wolfson said: “Whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg's decision to enter the presidential race is causing a stir amongst contenders.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Bernie Sanders tweeted:</p>
      <p>“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren also slammed the 77-year-old's announcement.</p>
      <p>“I understand that rich people are going to have more shoes than the rest of us, they’re going to have more cars than the rest of us, they’re going to have more houses,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But they don’t get a bigger share of democracy, especially in a Democratic primary. We need to be doing the face-to-face work that lifts every voice.”</p>
      <p>According to the Financial Times, Mr Bloomberg's aides insist he sees a clear path to victory based on his record in the private and public sectors.</p>
