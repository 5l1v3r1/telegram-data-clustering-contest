      <p>Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/michael-bloomberg-officially-declares-white-house-bid/">entering the 2020 presidential race</a> shows how “underwhelming” the Democratic candidates are.</p>
      <p>“It means that the Democratic field is underwhelming, even to someone like Michael Bloomberg,” she said Sunday on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-kellyanne-conway-on-face-the-nation-november-24-2019/">CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</a></p>
      <p>“There are 18 Democrats still running for president of the United States, Margaret, with probably another 10 or 12 already dropped out of the race. And as Michael Bloomberg coming in saying, ‘I don’t think any of you can beat Donald Trump,’ for all the talk about electability, that’s a fiction. You don’t know if somebody can or can’t win until they do or don’t,” she continued.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who served three terms as New York’s mayor, announced his 2020 candidacy in a video and statement on Sunday, saying he’s challenging Trump “to rebuild a country and restore faith in the dream that defines us.”</p>
      <p>Conway slammed Bloomberg’s video announcement and said the promises he made in it are “all unicorns and rainbows.”</p>
      <p>She said Trump will be ready to take on fellow billionaire Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>“The other thing is that Michael Bloomberg is saying rebuild America. America already elected a builder,” Conway said, adding that he should stick to being a mayor.</p>
      <p>“Look, Michael Bloomberg was a great mayor of New York City. I lived there under Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. All four of my kids were born in New York when Michael Bloomberg was mayor. I wish he’d be mayor of New York City again. But if he’s going to jump in I think the most important thing to note is not just does the country have an appetite for a billionaire who’s going to throw that money around the way billionaire Trump never did,” Conway said.</p>
      <p>“We were under-resourced and understaffed at the Trump campaign and we — and Hillary Clinton’s campaign showed the fastest way to make a small fortune is to have a very large one and waste most of it. It’s not that Michael Bloomberg may not be unwelcome by the national electorate — is he welcome in his own Democratic Party? You’ve got the front runners saying that we don’t want any billionaires in the country, let alone in the Democratic primary.”</p>
