      <p>Auchinleck will face Falkirk should they see off Arbroath in their third-round replay.</p>
      <p>Tommy Sloan's men were up 1-0 thanks to Dwayne Hyslop, but Michael McKenna scored from the penalty spot to take the tie to a replay.</p>
      <p>The East Ayrshire side have already disposed of the likes of Cove Rangers and Kelty Hearts this season.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock have also found out their opponents.</p>
      <p>Angelo Alessio's men have entered into the competition that they are aiming to win for the first time since 1997.</p>
      <p>Ray Montgomerie captained the side to victory that day at Ibrox, with Paul Wright scoring the vital goal in a 1-0 win over Falkirk.</p>
      <p>Italian boss Alessio is aiming to get Killie to Hampden for the first time since 2012, when they defeated Celtic 1-0 in the League Cup final thanks to a Dieter Van Tornhout header.</p>
      <p>Killie were close to booking a spot at Hampden earlier this season as they hosted Hibernian in a Betfred Cup quarter-final clash.</p>
      <p>But a penalty shootout proved to be Killie's downfall as they lost out and the capital men booked their Hampden spot.</p>
