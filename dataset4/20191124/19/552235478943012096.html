      <h2>Angelo Alessio's men have entered into the competition that they are aiming to win for the first time since 1997.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:41:31+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Lochlin Highet, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lochlin-highet/</a></address>
      <p>Kilmarnock will face Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup fourth-round.</p>
      <p>Angelo Alessio's men have entered into the competition that they are aiming to win for the first time since 1997.</p>
      <p>Ray Montgomerie captained the side to victory that day at Ibrox, with Paul Wright scoring the vital goal in a 1-0 win over Falkirk.</p>
      <p>Italian boss Alessio is aiming to get Killie to Hampden for the first time since 2012, when they defeated Celtic 1-0 in the League Cup final thanks to a Dieter Van Tornhout header.</p>
      <p>Killie were close to booking a spot at Hampden earlier this season as they hosted Hibernian in a Betfred Cup quarter-final clash.</p>
      <p>But a penalty shootout proved to be Killie's downfall as they lost out and the capital men booked their Hampden spot.</p>
      <p>Ties to be played on January 18</p>
