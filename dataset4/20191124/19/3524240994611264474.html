      <p>Substitute Kenan Kodro scored a late winner as Athletic Bilbao claimed a 2-1 victory at Osasuna on Sunday to move fifth in La Liga.</p>
      <p>The Basque side has now taken 10 points from their last four league games and sit only one point behind fourth-placed Sevilla, who visit Real Valladolid later on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Inaki Williams put the visitors ahead in the 21st minute with his third goal of the season, but Argentinian Ezequiel Avila levelled for Osasuna with 14 minutes to play.</p>
      <p>But only three minutes later, Bosnian Kodro sealed all three points for Bilbao on only his second appearance this term.</p>
      <p>Chinese forward Wu Lei scored his first league goal of the campaign to help Espanyol secure a 1-1 draw against Getafe.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was prolific in China for Shanghai SIPG but has struggled since moving to Spain in January.</p>
      <p>Former Newcastle United striker Joselu scored twice late on as Alaves won 2-0 at Eibar to take his Liga tally to six goals since leaving St Jamesâ€™ Park in the close season.</p>
      <p>Barcelona still leads the table on goal difference ahead of Real Madrid after beating Leganes on Saturday, with Atletico Madrid three points adrift.</p>
