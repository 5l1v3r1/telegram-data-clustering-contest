      <h1>DITO signs deals with two telecom tower builders</h1>

      <p>DITO Telecommunity Corp., a joint venture of businessman Dennis Uy and China Telecoms, signed separate agreements with two telecom tower companies to accelerate the rollout of its services nationwide.</p>
      <p>Leo Technologies Infrastructure Corp. and Alt-Global-Solutions Inc. signed separate memoranda of agreement with DITO Telecommunity on the provision of common towers, in-building solutions and rooftop tower construction services. </p>
      <p>“For the past few months, we have been pushing hard to have on board like-minded partners who are as committed as we are in making sure that we provide world-class telecommunications services to the Filipino; and would like to assure our countrymen that yes, DITO is very well on its way to provide faster, more affordable, and secure telecom services.,”  said DITO chief administrative officer Adel Tamano.</p>
      <p>DITO earlier tapped SkyCable Inc., Chavit Singson’s LCS Holdings, China Energy Equipment Co. Ltd. and ZEAL Power Construction and Development Corp. to build more cell sites in the country. </p>
      <p>The company signed memorandum of agreement with the Armed Forces of the Philippines that its devices, equipment and structures would not be used to obtain classified information from the AFP.</p>
      <p>“DITO is a Filipino company and will forever look after the interests of the Filipino. We value transparency and integrity in our business. This is the reason why we had a public memorandum of agreement signing with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, with members of the media present a few months ago,” said DITO chief technology officer Rodolfo Santiago.</p>
      <p>Santiago said the MOA signed with the AFP contained the same provisions signed by the other two telcos, but the former provider additional provisions pertaining to commitments of DITO to national security.</p>
      <p>DITO was selected as the third new major player in the country after PLDT and Globe Telecom. “A critical part of the new major player selection process was the submission of our cybersecurity plan to prove that our networks and facilities will not compromise national security and shall abide with the National Cybersecurity Plan. This plan has been accepted by the Department of Information and Communication Technology and the National Security Advisor,” Santiago said.</p>
      <p>DITO also committed to pass regular audits by the government to maintain its license to operate. </p>
      <p>“While we in DITO have yet to provide telecommunications services, we have set standards, controls, measures and rigid protocols to help protect the integrity of Philippine national security especially on cybersecurity,” Santiago said.</p>
      <p>“As we have said before, we in DITO are steadfast in our commitment to provide world-class and secure telecommunications services that the Filipino truly deserves,” he said.</p>
