      <h1>(Update: Amazon) Get a Pixel 4 for $599 or 4 XL for $699 ($200 off) before the Black Friday rush</h1>

        <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/24/google-pixel-4-black-friday-deal-200-off/#1">Update 1: 2019/11/24 12:39am PST<br/>The deal is now live on the Google Store and we've added the corresponding links above.<br/></a>
        <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/24/google-pixel-4-black-friday-deal-200-off/#2"> Update 2: 2019/11/24 11:29am PST<br/>Amazon, too</a>
      </p>
      <p>We already knew the Pixel 4 lineup would be <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/07/leaked-google-ad-discounts-the-pixel-4-and-4-xl-by-200-for-black-friday-sale/">getting a $200 discount</a> this Black Friday. Even Google <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/18/google-store-black-friday-deals/">teased it a few days ago</a> and promised the deal would start on November 24. Looking at my calendar, it sure seems like today is the day and the discount has already popped up at a few online retailers.</p>
      <p>Despite all the criticism (a tradition for all Pixels at this point), the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/08/pixel-4-xl-review/">Pixel 4 remains a good phone with a fantastic camera</a>. Its mediocre battery, meager storage options, and lack of a fingerprint reader shouldn't be discounted, but when the price drops by $200, they become a lot more palatable. So if you were waiting on a deal and hoping to snatch Google's latest <s>and greatest</s>, you can now do so.</p>
      <p>The discount is already live at Best Buy, B&amp;H, Walmart, and Abt. We know for a fact that the Google Store should join them, and Amazon will likely follow suit. We'll update this post once they do and if we find the offer at other retailers.</p>

      <p>Overall, you're looking at paying $599 for a 64GB Pixel 4, $699 for the 128GB variant, or also $699 for the 64GB Pixel 4 XL, and at the highest end of the spectrum, $799 for the 128GB Pixel 4 XL.</p>

      <p>According to Abt, the deal should last until December 2, i.e. Cyber Monday. So you have a week to make up your mind, but given Google's terrible shipping delays, you may want to hurry if you hope to get your shiny new toy before the holidays.</p>
