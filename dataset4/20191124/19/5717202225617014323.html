        <b><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-rhian-brewster-wanted-20946287">It has been suggested by the Daily Mirror this week</a> that Leeds United are one of the teams interested in signing Rhian Brewster on loan from Liverpool in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whites fans would be forgiven for not getting carried away with the rumours as things stand. It is difficult to imagine Marcelo Bielsa targeting another striker in January. He already has Patrick Bamford and Eddie Nketiah within in his ranks.</p>

      <p>It is also difficult to imagine Liverpool loaning Brewster to Leeds if Nketiah is still at Elland Road beyond January. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-rhian-brewster-wanted-20946287">The Mirror reports</a> that three other sides want Brewster, so Leeds may have their work cut out.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, if Leeds can sign the 19-year-old, it could be an incredibly exciting signing.</p>

      <p>And based on comments made by James Milner earlier this season, it would appear that Brewster would have the potential to be an inspired addition.</p>
      <p>“Rhian is an out-and-out goalscorer, you know that he’ll score goals. [He’s got] that hunger and he’s learning from one of the best there is at the other side of the game, Bobby. He might not be able to do the Cruyffs that Bobby can do but he is ruthless in front of goal, he’ll get plenty of goals,” he said, <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool/james-milner-hails-massive-difference-in-improving-liverpool-youngster-curtis-jones-a4247636.html">as reported by the London Evening Standard</a>.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Could Brewster help Leeds across the line?</h3>
      <p>Killing teams off has been Leeds’s major problem so far this season. They have not scored three goals in a Championship game since August. And they have only won one of their last 10 games by more than one goal.</p>
      <p>It must be noted that Bamford has been excellent even when he has found goals difficult to come by. Meanwhile, Nketiah’s strike-rate has been extremely impressive.</p>
      <p>But if they are in the market for a new striker, and Brewster is available to them, Milner’s comments suggest that the Liverpool teenager could be a fantastic signing.</p>
