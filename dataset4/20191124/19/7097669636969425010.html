      <h1>This 1 Way China Is Getting Even Stronger (Not What You Think)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Lyle J. Goldstein</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>China is learning how to fight its future wars by studying its failures.</p>
      <p><a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/2014-good-year-great-war-9652"><u>Even as Western strategists spill gobs of ink recalling the Great War that convulsed Europe a century ago</u></a>, Chinese military thinkers are actually fixated on another anniversary. 120 years ago, <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-war-made-asia-9474"><u>Japan shocked the world with a lightning campaign that not only reduced the faltering Qing dynasty to its knees in a matter of months</u></a>, but more to the point: put the pride of China’s then ascendant fleet on the bottom of the Yellow Sea.</p>
      <p>The war was primarily fought over the Korean Peninsula and featured two sizable naval engagements: the first near the Yalu and the second near the tip of the Shandong Peninsula at Weihai, <a href="http://www.jiawuzhanzheng.org/?photography=zhongguojiawuzhanzhengbowuguan-chenlieguan"><u>where an enormous Chinese museum has quite recently been completed to commemorate the war</u></a>. The conflict ended with Japan’s conquest of the Liaodong Peninsula, but this was not permitted by the jealous European Powers, which intervened collectively in the so-called “Triple Intervention.” Tokyo had to be satisfied with China’s recognition of an independent Korea, the not insignificant prize of Taiwan, a huge indemnity paid in silver, the right to navigate the Yangtze, as well as the opening of more treaty ports to Japanese merchants. <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-dragon-the-atom-how-china-sees-iran-the-nuclear-11664"><u>This edition of Dragon Eye</u></a> will not dwell on <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-rivalry-china-japan-11374"><u>recent China-Japan tensions</u></a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/leaders-china-japan-hold-ice-085529407.html"><u>which are presently experiencing a thaw albeit a tepid one</u></a>. Instead, this brief analysis endeavors to sample a few of the innumerable Chinese military writings published during 2014 on the subject of that pivotal conflict.</p>
