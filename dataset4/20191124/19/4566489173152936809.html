      <p>At the close of November 2019, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nordstrom-stock-rallies-as-earnings-top-street-view-2019-11-21">Nordstrom Inc. reported</a> better-than-expected quarterly results. Following the announcement shares rallied in extended trading (climbing 10 percent). The Seattle-based company stated it achieved fiscal third-quarter earnings of $126 million, or 81 cents per share.</p>
      <p>In addition, the department store operator <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q3-2019.html">posted revenue of $3.67 billion</a> in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Key to the growth, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q3-2019.html">as CNBC reports</a>, was Digital sales increased to 34 percent of the company total sales from 31 percent in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>To understand more, Digital Journal caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darinarcher/">Darin Archer</a>, Chief Strategy Officer at <a href="https://www.elasticpath.com/">Elastic Path</a>. Archer has assessed company’s physical retail, merchandising and e-commerce strategies and how the company is working to create seamless shopping experiences across new digital and physical channels.</p>
      <p>Archer notes how stores which are more associated with bricks and mortar can compete in the digital age: "Some might balk at opening a giant flagship store during the current retail climate, but Nordstrom has done a lot of things right with its store planning and merchandising that should set the company up for success if it’s able to effectively execute on its strategy."</p>
      <p>He notes that one aspect is to go local: "As Nordstrom opens more merchandising-free Local stores, the company has an opportunity to create high-touch customer experiences. They can also more effectively cater to consumer desires for convenience with things like buy-online-pick-up-in-store without maintaining a network of expensive, large-format stores."</p>
      <p>Another key aspect is the multi-channel experience: "The company has emphasized creating a seamless experience for consumers across all these store formats and online touchpoints."</p>
      <p>With a strong digital strategy, Archer sees the future as bright for Nordstrom: "By continuing to innovate and create experiences that engage customers across these channels and throughout the buyer journey, I think they’ll continue to see success."</p>
