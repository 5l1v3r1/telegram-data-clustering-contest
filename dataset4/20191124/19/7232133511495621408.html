      <p>Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent plunge under $8,000 to tap $6,800 has done numbers of the sentiment in the cryptocurrency industry. As a popular trader, Crypto Michael, noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1198166069770412033">recent tweet</a>, the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index recently printed a 23, which is on the “extreme fear” side of the oscillating indicator.</p>

      <p>An aside: While this reading may seem entirely arbitrary, especially considering the bullish momentum Bitcoin has experienced in the first half of 2019, the index’s readings are backed by data. The <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">website that hosts the index claims</a> it analyses a fair mix of volatility, market momentum and volume, social media trends, surveys, dominance, and Google Trends to get the gist of how cryptocurrency investors are faring.</p>
      <p>The reading of 23, and thus “extreme fear,” are relevant because many<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/crypto-market-fear-index-suggests-bitcoin-price-has-further-to-fall/"> believe that emotions drive markets,</a> especially the cryptocurrency market. As analyst RektCapital wrote in a<a href="https://medium.com/@rektcapital/how-to-use-the-fear-greed-index-to-predict-increases-in-bitcoins-price-1bd2b54069f7"> recent blog post:</a></p>
      <blockquote>“Human psychology tends to be predictably irrational because many people tend to react similarly in certain contexts… Baron Rothschild made a fortune by buying when others sold in panic. His philosophy was to ‘Buy when there’s blood in the streets.’ Because the greater the fear — the larger the opportunity for profit.</blockquote>
      <p>With that in mind, is there any chance at Bitcoin bouncing?</p>

      <h3>Will Bitcoin Bottom?</h3>
      <p>According to a number of analysts, for sure.</p>
      <p>An analyst that goes by “Salsa” <a href="https://twitter.com/SalsaTekila/status/1198408029584142342/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1198408029584142342&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D405292%26action%3Dedit%26classic-editor">noted</a> that Bitcoin and Ethereum’s three-day charts printed the same extremely bullish candle pattern: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/24/bitcoin-price-macro-bottom-saturday-implies-so/">a swing failure pattern</a> “below major liquidity pools on the three-day time frame.” He noted that this contributes to the idea that BTC “bottomed on a macro scale.”</p>

      <p>Also, Dave the Wave, an analyst who called the drop to $6,700 months and months ago, said that there is a confluence of technical factors that suggest a long-term bottom was put in at $6,700.</p>
      <p>This confluence includes but isn’t limited to the three-year moving average—which currently sits in the low-$6,000s—is where BTC historically has found support in early bull markets and the fact that the cryptocurrency has bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement level of the $3,200 to $13,800 range, implying bottoming price action.</p>
