      <p>Paramedics were allegedly called, but it’s being reported that Morton was pronounced dead at the scene and transported to the coroner’s office where an autopsy is currently pending to determine cause of death.</p>

      <p>Morton was also known for previously dating Lindsay Lohan in 2006 before ending their relationship.</p>
      <p>The businessman is best known for his stake in Pink Taco, which started out in L.A. The chain has since expanded across the US. His father, Peter Morton, began the famous Hard Rock Cafe empire in 1971, and his grandfather founded Morton’s Steakhouse.</p>
      <p>Morton recently made headlines for purchasing Elvis Presley’s former Beverly Hills estate, the same estate Presley bought the same year he married Priscilla Presley. Although sources said this is not the residence in which he was found.</p>
