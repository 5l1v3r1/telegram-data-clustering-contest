      <h1>BBC-backed gang film banned from Vue cinemas after mass brawl outside screening</h1>

      <p>A BBC-backed gang film has been banned from Vue cinemas following a mass brawl involving youths armed with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/23/police-officers-assaulted-responding-cinema-brawl/">knives and machetes outside a screening in Birmingham.</a></p>
      <p>Blue Story, a film about a postcode war in south London, will not be shown in any of the chain’s UK venues after a riot at the Star City multiplex in Nechells, Birmingham, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Families queuing to watch the opening night of Frozen 2 at the cinema were horrified when a fight between three girls escalated into major disorder at 5.30pm. </p>
      <p>Seven police officers were injured as they arrested five teenagers and used Tasers to clear a crowd of up to 100 people from the cinema, which was then closed for the night.</p>
      <p>Choleigh McGuire, who was waiting to watch Frozen 2 with her 11-year-old sister, said it was “one of the scariest experiences of my life”.</p>

      <p>“It was so scary … we had a Taser pointed at us my little sister didn’t know what to do she just froze,” she wrote, in a Twitter post. </p>
      <p>“There was a fight in the cinema … [a] group of girls on one girl and it all escalated – the group ran into the cinema rooms to hide and a lot of police turned up.”</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police sent dozens of officers to the cinema following a report of a gang of youths with machetes. </p>
      <p>The force said they were “met with a very hostile response” and had to draw their Tasers to restore order.</p>
      <p>They arrested a 13-year-old girl, a boy and girl aged 14, and a 19-year-old man on suspicion of assaulting police.</p>
      <p>A boy, 14, was also held on suspicion of obstructing police. </p>
      <p>Two machetes and a knife were found by officers at the cinema, which reopened on Sunday.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Vue cinemas stopped screening Blue Story, co-produced by BBC Films and Paramount Pictures UK. </p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film. The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority.”</p>
      <p>Vue has 91 venues in the UK and Ireland, but could not confirm how many had been screening Blue Story.</p>

      <p>The film’s director Andrew Onwubolu, known as Rapman, has said the gang film is about “love not violence”.</p>
      <p>He said on Instagram: “Sending love to all those involved in yesterday’s violence at Star City in Birmingham. </p>
      <p>"It’s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. Blue Story is a film about love not violence.</p>
      <p>“I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.”</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Steve Graham said the disorder “may be the worst thing” the responding officers had seen during their time at West Midlands Police.</p>
      <p>A BBC Films spokeswoman said: "We are appalled by the incident at Star City and our thoughts are with all those affected by it.</p>
      <p>"Blue Story is an outstanding, critically acclaimed debut feature which powerfully depicts the futility of gang violence. </p>
      <p>"It’s an important film from one of the UK’s most exciting new filmmakers which we’re proud to be part of."</p>
      <p>Paramount Pictures UK was not available for comment.</p>
