      <h1>Fair City's Johnny Ward hints he may find love in 2020 after splitting with girlfriend</h1>
      <h2>The Dancing With The Stars pin-up recently split up with Rachel after six years together</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:43:57+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/jim-gallagher/" target="_blank">Jim Gallagher</a></address>
      <p>Soap star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/johnny-ward">Johnny Ward</a> has hinted 2020 may be the year his love life blossoms - after losing his girlfriend of six years.</p>
      <p>The actor’s career has gone into overdrive, meaning he’s been much too busy for romance.</p>
      <p>But he reckons next year that could change.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dancing-with-the-stars">Dancing With The Stars</a> pin-up, who has shot down suggestions he’s seeing his former dance partner Emily Barker, said: “Maybe I will meet someone in 2020. Who knows what will happen?”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fair-city">Fair City</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/love-hate">Love/Hate</a> actor added: “I’ve had no time for a love life.”</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old star surprised fans earlier this year when he and girlfriend Rachel split up after six years.</p>

      <p>It came after the death of his beloved father John while he was taking part in DWTS and then his mother Kathy suffered a heart attack.</p>
      <p>Johnny added: “With myself and Rachel, it was just really unfortunate. But my relationship and that of my two sisters all ended.</p>
      <p>“Since my father passed it was like something came into the house and ripped everything apart.</p>
      <p>“I never saw it coming. I was very, very happy and I would love to be able to tell you all these horrible things about Rachel but I can’t because she is an absolutely incredible person.</p>

      <p>“She is someone who I would love to still have contact with but I haven’t spoken to her in a very long time and we didn’t end on bad terms at all.</p>
      <p>“I just needed to move back in with my mum and be there for her and it was just a very difficult time.</p>
      <p>“I suppose that thing with my father – he made me promise that no matter what happened, I had to stay in the competition and do it for him – made it very difficult. I think I became slightly obsessed with it.</p>
      <p>“Everyone else seemed to enjoy it but I didn’t because that’s all I was thinking about and I just needed to be on my own for a long time. It’s still a bit like that.</p>
      <p>“I would love to say I’m back out dating but I’ve had no time. I went straight into the show, Copper Face Jacks, after double jobbing with Fair City and Dancing With the Stars rehearsals.</p>
      <p>“It’s been so busy but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s a good distraction and now I’m preparing for the panto, Aladdin, in Limerick University Concert Hall.</p>
      <p>“These are all little stepping stones to keeping busy, it’s a little distraction after everything that’s happened.”</p>
      <p>The star revealed over the weekend that he was not seeing his 22-year-old dance partner Emily and that he looked on her like his “little sister”.</p>
