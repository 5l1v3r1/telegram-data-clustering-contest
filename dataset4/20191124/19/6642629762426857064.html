      <p>Romania's centrist President Klaus Iohannis easily won a presidential runoff vote as expected, crushing his socialist challenger on a pledge to restart a judicial reform slowed down by successive Social Democrat (PSD) governments.</p>
      <p>Iohannis had been the short-odds favourite to beat former PSD prime minister Viorica Dancila comfortably in Sunday's runoff.</p>
      <p>An exit poll conducted by IRES pollster showed Iohannis garnered 66.5 percent of votes followed by Dancila with 33.5 percent. Another pollster CURS-Avangarde showed Iohannis winning with 64 percent.</p>
      <p>Under a succession of PSD governments, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/romania.html">Romania</a> rolled back anti-corruption measures and weakened the independence of the courts. Along with ex-communist peers Poland and Hungary, it has been heavily criticised by Brussels for its actions.</p>
      <p>However, the 60-year-old Iohannis has been credited by Western allies and the European Union with trying to protect the rule of law, in particular by challenging attempts to limit judges' independence.</p>
      <p>The president's powers are mostly limited to nominating a prime minister based on who can command a majority, challenging laws in the Constitutional Court and appointing some chief prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Iohannis will have a chance to install anti-graft and anti-mafia prosecutors who are serious about tackling endemic corruption with the backing of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, who became head of a liberal minority government by winning a parliamentary vote of confidence three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Teacher Andreea Mihai, 50, said earlier if Iohannis won on Sunday, "things should slowly return to normality.</p>
      <p>"Both Orban and Iohannis will work together in the same direction," Mihai said.</p>
      <p>Dancila's PSD had increased the burden of proof in corruption cases, reorganised panels of judges and set up a special unit to investigate magistrates for potential abuses, a move widely seen as an instrument of political coercion.</p>
      <p>Romania's judicial reforms have been monitored by Brussels since it joined the EU in 2007; in October, Brussels said the reforms were going backwards.</p>
      <p>Iohannis, a soft-spoken ethnic German and former mayor of Sibiu, became president in 2014.</p>
      <p>He helped to secure a popular approval in a referendum last May that called for the government to be banned from altering legislation by emergency decree, and advocated a ban on amnesties and pardons for graft-related crimes.</p>
