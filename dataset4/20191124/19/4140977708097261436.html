                            <p>Meanwhile, Manchester united just escaped from a disaster as they prevented a defeat from Sheffield United, even though the former was under a 2 goal deficit for the most part of the game.</p>
                            <p>The strike by <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/phil-jones-blunder-costs-manchester-united-as-sheffield-united-score/">John Fleck in the 15th minute</a> of the game and the second goal in the 52nd minute by Lys Mousset brought Manchester United at a huge disadvantage.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>But a goal by Brandon Williams made Solskjaerâ€™s boys belive and a strike each by Mason Greenwood and <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/sheffield-united-vs-manchester-unite">Marcus Rashford brought the team in lead</a> within the window of 10 minutes.</p>
                            <p>Although, this did not last for long, as a 90th-minute volley by Oli McBurnie allowed Sheffield United to take away a point from the game. Yet, it was unfortunate for the hosts as they dominated their opposition for the majority part of the game but still, they could not bag three points.</p>
