      <p>Lounges restaurant group has teamed up with food tech company Moving Mountains to provide the 12-inch meal in 125 of its restaurants across the UK.</p>
      <p>These include six in areas of Bristol such as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/totterdown">Totterdown</a>, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/totterdown">Bedminster</a> and Gloucester Road.</p>
      <p>At 10 inches and 3cm in width, the Moving Mountains Hot Dog is larger than the average hot dog and will be available for £11.95.</p>
      <p>It is served with a vegan Gouda cheese, fried onions, gherkins, tomatoes, pickled onions, American mustard and red pepper ketchup.</p>

      <p>"The Moving Mountains jumbo Hot Dog is not only really delicious, it is also replicates a hot dog in every way and is created with natural ingredients including sunflower seeds.”</p>
