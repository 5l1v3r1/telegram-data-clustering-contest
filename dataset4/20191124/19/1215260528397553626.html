      <p><b>11.40 a.m:</b> Juliet Cuthbert Flynn, the Member of Parliament for St Andrew West Rural hits out against abuse of women in Jamaica. “Gender equality is a human right and we need to empower our women and girls and let them know they are loved and treasured,” Cuthbert Flynn told the massive gathering of JLP supporters in the National Arena.
