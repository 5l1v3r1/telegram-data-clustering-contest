      <h1>Coast Guard takes 23 NY Waterway ferries out of service, delays expected</h1>

      <p>Nearly two-dozen ferries operated by NY Waterway were taken out of service and flagged for safety issues — an impact that will lead to some delays Monday morning, officials said.</p>
      <p>The US Coast Guard on Sunday said it ordered NY Waterway to suspend service on 23 ferries, which its inspectors found “had damage or discrepancies significant enough to warrant a suspension of service.”</p>
      <p>The total number of vessels placed out of commission is far worse than <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/coast-guard-removes-9-hudson-river-ferries-from-service-over-safety-concerns/">the nine reported on Friday.</a></p>
      <p>Most of the issues were related to fire safety systems and emergency systems, said Coast Guard spokesman John Hightower.</p>
      <p>Twenty-one vessels of NY Waterway’s fleet of 32 were inspected Saturday, with the rest performed over the past two weeks.</p>
      <p>Eight ferries so far have received repairs and have gotten the green light to return to service, officials said Sunday.</p>
      <p>Still, passengers should expect delays on their Monday commute.</p>
      <p>“We apologize for the inconvenience to our customers. There will be minor delays in service Monday morning but all routes will be running,” said NY Waterway spokesman Pat Smith. “We are working with the Coast Guard to resolve issues as quickly as possible.”</p>
      <p>Routes that run every 10 minutes may instead run every 20, Smith said of the anticipated delays.</p>
      <p>NY Waterway operates 32 ferries year-round from four piers in Manhattan across the Hudson River to eight locations in New Jersey, including stops in Hoboken and Weehawken.</p>
      <p>It also operates the Brookfield Place/Battery Park City Ferry Terminal and service between Newburgh and Beacon, as well as between Haverstraw and Ossining.</p>
