      <h1>ASU Groundskeeper tweets "deal" with students after they rushed the field</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.abc15.com/sports/jayden-daniels-arizona-state-upset-no-6-oregon-31-28">TEMPE — Arizona State's historic homecoming win</a> against the Oregon Ducks was cause for major celebration, especially for the Student Section that rushed the field following the Sun Devil's 31-28 defeat of the Ducks.</p>

      <p>But one ASU fan (and employee) wasn't as enthused about students rushing the field: Groundskeeper Brian Johnson.</p>
      <p>In a Tweet posted shortly after 11 p.m. on Saturday, Johnson made a deal with his Twitter followers in an attempt to keep them from rushing the field again.</p>
      <p>"For all my Twitter followers, let’s make a deal," Johnson tweeted. "You never rush the field again AND I’ll paint a center logo next week that you’ll be talking about for years to come AND after every win vs ranked opponents you can come to my house on Sunday for unlimited jagermeister shots. Deal?"</p>

      <p>Some replies to Johnson's tweet were enthusiastic with some people asking for Tequila or unlimited Ginger Ale, requests to which Johnson, albeit begrudgingly, agreed.</p>
      <p>"I appreciate the sentiment but no deal," another fan replied.</p>
      <p>One curious fan asked Johnson what he has to deal with every time students rush the field.</p>
      <p>"Late in the season, especially on damp nights, it just tamps the grass down and prevents it from recovering quickly. Also I caught about a dozen people digging chunks of grass from the field, which isn’t good," Johnson replied.</p>
      <p>Johnson's earnest and comedic request makes even more sense when you consider the groundskeeper and a large team spent the days before ASU's homecoming game drying up a drenched field following powerful storms that hit the Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Johnson tweeted that ASU was no longer able to enter the second annual "fan vote field design contest" after the field was covered with tarp to protect the grass's integrity prior to Saturday's game.</p>

      <p>Another tweet posted by Johnson chronicled the process it took to empty the field of water:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And while ASU fans weren't able to appreciate Johnson's planned PAC12 design for Saturday's game, he didn't leave much to the imagination, tweeting out two proposed designs that would've graced Sun Devil Stadium on homecoming weekend had rain not hit the Valley.</p>
      <p>"Just remember-neither of these are happening because of the rain," Johnson tweeted.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"With 3 days of rain, multiple tarp pulls, and a rushed paint job, this is the best we got," Johnson tweeted.</p>
      <p>Even with the rain and a rushed paint job, we're sure Johnson, the Sun Devils and their fans can still celebrate the team's signature win of the season, which has made them bowl eligible prior to next weekend's Duel in the Desert game.</p>

      <p>Arizona State will host UArizona in the Duel in the Desert game Saturday, November 30th.</p>
      <p>Here's to hoping <a href="https://www.abc15.com/weather">next week's storms</a> won't ruin the special design Johnson has planned for the ASU vs. UofA game.</p>
