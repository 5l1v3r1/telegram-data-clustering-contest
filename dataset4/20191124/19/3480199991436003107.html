      <p>Coming in at 64 pages – front and back covers included – the Conservative Party manifesto is about two-thirds of the length of the documents published by Labour (107 pages) and the Liberal Democrats (100 pages).</p>
      <p>It runs to about 21,500 words, compared with 26,500 for Labour and 28,400 for the Lib Dems.</p>

      <p>Given the manifesto’s brevity, it is perhaps no surprise there are fewer mentions of certain key words than in the other documents.</p>
      <p>“Economy”, for example, appears 28 times in the Tory manifesto, compared with 36 for Labour and 49 for the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>“Environment”, or variations of the word such as “environmental”, appear 22 times, versus 55 for Labour and 49 for the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>And “crime” gets mentioned 24 times, compared with Labour’s 32 and the Lib Dems’ 27.</p>
      <p>But “Brexit” turns up on 61 occasions, outnumbering the equivalent totals for Labour (21) and the Lib Dems (49).</p>
      <p>The acronym “NHS” also appears more often than in the other documents – 45 (Conservative) compared with 34 (Labour) and 37 (Lib Dems).</p>

      <p>Some topics get roughly the same volume of namechecks in all three manifestos – for example “investment” (30 mentions in the Tory manifesto, 36 for Labour and 35 for the Lib Dems) and “broadband” (five, 10 and six respectively).</p>
      <p>There are other phrases that loom large in one or two of the documents, but not in others.</p>
      <p>“Climate emergency” appears nine times for Labour and 14 for the Lib Dems, but only once for the Tories.</p>
      <p>“Austerity” isn’t mentioned by either the Tories or Lib Dems, but gets 10 namechecks by Labour.</p>

      <p>“Publicly owned” is another phrase that appears only in Labour’s document (four times) and not the others.</p>
      <p>And there is one word that barely appears at all. “Deficit”, one of the dominant economic themes of the past decade, gets just one mention in the Conservative manifesto – and none at all the manifestos of Labour and the Lib Dems.</p>
