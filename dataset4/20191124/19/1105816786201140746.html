      <p>Nasir Butt has also filed a joint petition to become a party in Nawaz’s appeal.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief had also filed a petition through his counsel for exemption from hearing before the court due to health reasons.</p>
      <p>The petition said that the former premier’s sentence had been suspended for eight weeks and that he had gone abroad with the permission of Lahore High Court. Therefore, he could not appear before the court.</p>
      <p>It was further stated that Ibrahim Haroon Advocate would appear before the court on his behalf.</p>
      <p>Accountability court Judge Mohammad Arshad Malik had on December 24 convicted Nawaz in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills Company (ASCL) and Hill Metal Establishment (HME) reference and awarded him seven years imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs1.5 billion and $25 million.</p>
