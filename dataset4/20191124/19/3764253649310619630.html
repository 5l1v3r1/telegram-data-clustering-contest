      <p>Manchester United squander a classic comeback at the very last minute in a dramatic 3-3 draw against Premier League newcomers Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>In what proved to be a game of two halves, Solskjaer’s men turned the game on its head in a span of seven minutes courtesy of academy players who continue to show loads of promise.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils had a slow start to the game and were made to pay by The Blades following a spell of laxity from defender Phil Jones.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United went 2-0 up early in the second half as United were once again guilty of some sloppy play which allowed midfielder Lys Mousset to slot home a stunning low shot from just outside the area.</p>

      <p>It looked like the match would meander towards another United defeat, and possibly calls for the sacking of Solskjaer, but the Norwegian’s boys had other ideas on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Introduction of Jesse Lingard and Mason Greenwood seemed to inject the much needed pace into Manchester United’s game and it paid dividend as the away side pulled one back courtesy of fullback Brandon Williams who crisply connected with a floating ball in the 72nd minute.</p>
      <p>The goals seemed to invigorate United who were all over the hosts and five minutes later the game was level after 19-year old Mason Greenwood latched at a Marcus Rashford cross make the game 2-2.</p>
      <p>Rashford completed the comeback barely two minutes later as another swift counter attack saw the England forward on the end of a Daniel James cross to slot home.</p>
      <p>It was a comeback that was reminiscent of the Sir Alex Ferguson era and it would have been thoroughly applauded had Oliver McBurnie not come up with a dramatic equalizer at the very death.</p>

      <p>A scruff in the Manchester United box saw substitute Callum Robison dig out a cross which found McBurnie who controlled and hit home a goal which was initially contested by opposition on allegations of a handball.</p>
      <p>Upon review by the Video Assisted Referee, the goal stood and both sides had to settle for a point in a topsy-turvy game.</p>
      <p>The draw arguably suits Sheffield much more than United as the Blades climbed two places to sixth while United are now up to ninth, level on points with Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan made it clear that he does not believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can operate at the required level that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256247-solskjaer-told-by-simon-jordan-boss-manchester-united.html">is expected from a Man United coach.</a></p>
      <p>Last year when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced Mourinho at Old Trafford, he started well, as he went some games unbeaten but United ended up without a trophy.</p>
