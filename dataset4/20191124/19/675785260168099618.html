      <h2>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was far from happy with his side's performance in the first half against newly-promoted Sheffield United at Bramall Lane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:47:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed he wanted to substitute all 11 players before <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> battled back to earn at draw at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer was angry with their dire first-half performance when they trailed 1-0 before his young side turned this exhilarating game on its head by scoring three times in seven minutes.</p>
      <p>“We were very poor,” said the Manchester United boss. “It made me think of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> away last season when were 2-0 down and lost 4-0 in the end.</p>
      <p>“I could have changed 11 players at half-time, apart from the keeper.</p>
      <p>“Sheffield United looked like they wanted it more than us and believed in their game plan more than we did. We did not have a shot on target first half which is not acceptable.</p>

      <p>“I was angry, disappointed. I don’t know what emotions you want and I had to wake them up at half-time.</p>
      <p>“Suddenly they were trying things and it took the fear away.”</p>
      <p>Teenagers Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood scored before Marcus Rashford gave United the lead only for Oli McBurnie to equalise in the 90th-minute with a goal, which survived a VAR check for handball.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer hailed his side’s fighting spirit and claimed they would have lost this game last season.</p>
      <p>“The difference in this team compared to last year is huge,” he said. “They never give in. Last year we would have gone in four or five down instead of coming back. We would not have been able to come back.</p>

      <p>“This team doesn’t give in now and that’s such a difference from last year to now.</p>
      <p>“The boys would have learned a lesson for 70 minutes, but the way they turned that bad 70 minutes into a positive is good.”</p>
