      <h1>Gary Neville critical of Manchester United defender Phil Jones</h1>
      <h2>Club legend <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gary-neville/"><b>Gary Neville</b></a> has criticised the defending of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phil-jones/"><b>Phil Jones</b></a> during <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a>'s 3-3 draw with Sheffield United.</h2>

      <p>The Red Devils put together a stunning comeback to lead during the closing stages, only for Oliver McBurnie to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/result/result-sheffield-united-salvage-late-draw-after-man-utd-comeback_380495.html">net a controversial equaliser for the Blades</a>.</p>
      <p>However, while on commentary for <i>Sky Sports</i>, Neville slammed the efforts of Jones, who lost out to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lys-mousset/"><b>Lys Mousset</b></a> on the byline before <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-fleck/"><b>John Fleck</b></a> put the home side ahead at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Neville said: "It's channel ball, the easiest ball to deal with for a centre-back and he doesn't deal with it. He has a look over his shoulder and in that moment he loses it."</p>
      <p>With United having been outplayed during the opening 45 minutes, Jones was substitute at half time.</p>
