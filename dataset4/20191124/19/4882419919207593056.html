      <p>Alongside his international teammate and friend, Alexandre Lacazette, Samuel Umtiti gave an interview to 'Team Orange Football' in which he talked about his current plans as well as what he would like to do in the future.</p>
      <p>When the time comes to hang up his boots, Umtiti wants to remain in the sport. "I'd like to be a coach. I take notes from those I've worked under, their training sessions and what they do."</p>
      <p>Likewise Umtiti isn't ruling out a return to his native France and, in particular, his former club Lyon. "Returning to Lyon is a possibility, as a player or as a coach," admitted the centre back who played for them from 2011 until 2016.</p>

      <h3>DEMBÉLÉ and GRIEZMANN</h3>
      <p>Umtiti joked about his French teammates Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann. He said the former "wasn't at the right level, he's only mature when he draws" and on Griezmann his light-hearted criticism was related to how he looked.</p>
      <p>"I don't like Griezmann's haircut at all and I tell him he needs to cut it every morning. But he always says that it's a work in progress," admitted Umtiti. "He also says he's really good at basketball and he's good but he isn't as good as he says he is."</p>
      <p>On his adaptation to life at FC Barcelona: "Everything was great. I was surrounded by top players, who had won everything, but I saw them as humble people. Thanks to them it was very easy to adjust here," confessed Umtiti.</p>
      <p>Lastly he was quizzed about his ideal five-a-side team. "Messi, because with just him that's enough. Ter Stegen is very good and he would be in my team alongside Messi, myself, Lacazette and Iniesta."</p>
      <p>Umtiti finished with some special words for don Andres. "I adored Iniesta and when I came to the club I was so impressed. What Messi does is extraordinary but but Iniesta is incredible. How he is both on and off the pitch, calm and really good. He's a player respected by everyone."</p>
