      <h1>I flew Delta's reviled 767 business class seat from Europe to New York. Here's what it was actually like.</h1>

        <li>I recently flew <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/delta-air-lines">Delta</a> from Berlin to New York in Delta One <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/business-class">business class</a> after I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alitalia-business-class-flight-review-rome-photos-777-200-2019-11">scored an incredible deal</a>, and managed to stack two different discounts on my flights for the trip.</li>
        <li>Although the Boeing 767-400 features one of Delta’s oldest business class seats, and is often the subject of complaints from frequent flyers, I found the ride incredibly comfortable, and was blown away by the incredible service.</li>
        <li>The seat is definitely showing its age, and part of it was even broken. But it was tasty food and a lie-flat seat on a long flight – what’s not to like?</li>

      <p>I recently scored an incredible deal and got to fly business class on Delta’s Boeing 767-400. While the plane features Delta’s full-fledged Delta One business class, it’s one of the older products in Delta’s fleet – the airline is actually in the <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-rolls-out-latest-cabins-europe-and-south-america">process of slowly retrofitting the planes</a> with brand new interiors.</p>
      <p>A lot of travel <a href="https://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2015/10/01/review-delta-one-london/">bloggers</a>, <a href="http://modhop.com/delta-one-business-class-review-767-300-video/">influencers</a>, and <a href="https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-air-lines-skymiles/1770525-767-400-delta-one-review-like-sleeping-your-own-coffin.html">message board</a> posters have complaned about the Delta One seat on the 767 in recent years. Most of the complaints focused on the fact that it feels narrow – at least, compared to the seats on wider planes like the 777. Other complaints have targeted the seats’ age, or the fact that the in-flight entertainment screen is small.</p>
      <p>Some, though, have <a href="https://pointmetotheplane.boardingarea.com/simmer-down-everyone-deltas-767-business-class-is-actually-pretty-good/">argued against</a> that criticism, and said that the seats are <a href="https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2019/07/26/in-praise-of-an-aging-lie-flat-and-stellar-crew-on-delta-767-300/">actually great</a>. Especially for travelers – like me – who usually fly in coach, and compare everything to that standard.</p>
      <p>Read on to see what the flight was like:</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Berlin’s Tegel Airport is an … interesting place. Rather than going through security and then getting to the gates, each gate has its own security screening.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The airport first opened in 1948 and was used during the Berlin Airlift for military and supply planes. It began commercial operations in 1960.</p>
      <p>It was originally scheduled to be closed in 2012, when development of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport was expected to be completed. However, ongoing delays to the Brandenburg project have extended Tegel’s life.</p>

      <h3>That means that the business class lounges are pre-security, so you can head right to them after checking in, but need to leave early enough to go through security.</h3>

      <h3>It took me a little while to find the Air France lounge, which I could access as a Delta One passenger. It was up a few floors and tucked in a corner</h3>
      <figure>

      <hr/>
      <h3>The lounge was relatively small but also not very crowded. It was perfectly comfortable for the 45 minutes I spent there. When I checked in, the attendant told me when I should make sure to get to security at least an hour before my flight time.</h3>

      <h3>There were a handful of self-serve drinks, including soda, beer, wine, liquor, and water…</h3>

      <h3>… And a handful of snacks and warm dishes. It was nothing fancy, but certainly more comfortable than killing time in the terminal.</h3>

      <h3>With a little more than an hour until departure, I went to the gate. Each gate has its own security screening, and Delta set up a separate line for business class and frequent flyers with elite status. There were a few people in front of me, and the whole process took about 15 minutes.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8be5dc205621a2aeead9e6bee5b36f7b7bce4e38-800x600.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>If you aren’t able to use the priority lane, you definitely want to get to the gate more than an hour in advance – Tegel security is very thorough, which means lines can move slowly.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The gate area post-security was quite crowded, with all the seats taken and people standing pretty much everywhere.</h3>

      <h3>Each of the business-class seats has a small side table, so the rows are staggered. That means that some seats, like mine, have the the table between the seat and the aisle, making it feel more private when you go to sleep …</h3>

      <h3>… And others — like the seat in front of me — are directly against the aisle and have the table on the inside, in this case, against the window. On some planes, those seats can feel a lot less private and make sleeping a bit harder.</h3>

      <h3>Each seat has an in-flight entertainment screen. But the screens are pretty old. They’re perfectly fine, but are relatively low-definition and can be fairly hard to see when the cabin lights are on or the window shades are open.</h3>

      <p>The newer in-flight entertainment screens on most of Delta’s fleet are a significant improvement.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The other complaint is that the seats are definitely showing their age. This is definitely true — as if to prove it, one of the panels under the screen was falling off.</h3>

      <p>To skip ahead a bit, service throughout the flight was incredible. Christopher introduced himself to every passenger in the cabin, which made the flight feel so personal. He was an American who studied abroad in Germany during college and spoke fluent German, so he was a big fan of working the Berlin and Munich flights.</p>
      <p>Throughout the flight, the flight attendants and purser were constantly keeping an eye on the cabin in case anyone needed anything. They filled my water glass a few times without me even realizing that they were coming through the aisles, offered to answer any questions, and were all great to chat with, without being overbearing or anything if I wanted to relax or work.</p>
      <p>I fly fairly often for work or otherwise, on a variety of airlines in a variety of cabins, but I was genuinely impressed by the whole crew on this flight.</p>

      <p>Because the Boeing 767 is narrower than most other wide-body planes – like the Boeing 777 or 787, or the Airbus A330 – business class seats tend to be a bit narrower than on the bigger jets.</p>

      <p>It was a business class seat with direct aisle access, a relative degree of privacy, and plenty of space. No, it’s not the newest seat in the sky, but – aside from the cosmetic damage and the sub-par screen – it stood on its own merits.</p>
      <p>Service was phenomenal, the food and drinks were good, and I was able to lie down flat while sleeping and watching movies. That’s pretty much all you can ask for from a business class flight.</p>
      <p>It’s certainly relatively narrow compared to the business class seats you’d find on a bigger plane, and someone larger might have trouble getting comfortable in lie-flat mode. But compared to coach, it’s a world of difference.</p>
      <p>Delta is <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-rolls-out-latest-cabins-europe-and-south-america">in the process of replacing the seats</a> on the 767-400. The new cabin looks like it will be beautiful, but until it’s ready, I think the current business class seats are still a treat.</p>
