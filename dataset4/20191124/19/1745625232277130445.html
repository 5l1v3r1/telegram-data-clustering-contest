      <h3>Far-Right Terrorism Has Spiked By 320 Percent In 4 Years, Says Report</h3>

      <p>An annual report released by the global conflict thinktank Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) suggests a 320 percent spike in far-right <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/terrorism">terrorism</a> from 2014 to 2018, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/far-right-terrorism-increased-320-percent-4-years-extremism-watchdog-1472642?utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter"><i>Newsweek</i></a> reports.</p>
      <p>Although the number of deaths from terrorism are reportedly declining — with the 2019 Global Terrorism Index showing a global decrease in the number of deaths, attacks, and economic damage due to terrorism — the report notes that terrorist activity is still significant. In particular, there is an increase in the activity from right-wing terrorist groups.</p>
      <p>Specifically, IEP reports that Europe, North America, and Oceania saw a 52 percent increase in the number of far-right killings in 2018. The trend appears to have continued in 2019, with right-wing terror causing 77 deaths up to the end of September 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/far-right-terrorism-has-more-than-tripled-over-last-four-years-report-warns/"><i>EURACTIV</i></a> reports that such far-right attacks are typically carried out by “lone wolf” attackers that are not aligned with a particular group. But it also notes that experts believe such a phrase is misleading because these terrorists still remain connected to support networks. In addition, the radicalization of such terrorists can often be traced to a base organization.</p>
      <p>Steve Killelea, the Founder and Executive Chairman of the IEP, believes that a 320 percent spike in terrorist attacks over four years should not be taken lightly, adding that most of the deaths from far-right terrorism recorded in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania were in the United States and Canada. Killelea noted easy access to firearms in such countries.</p>

      <p>According to Killelea, a possible cause of the trend is an increase in people that lose faith in the political leadership, which leads to such individuals becoming “disaffected with the system” — a process he claims is exacerbated by economic inequality.</p>

      <blockquote>“I think the trend for far-right terrorist activity is on is on the increase. Where that goes two, three years out from now is difficult to determine.”</blockquote>
      <p>The report also noted a decline in Islamist terrorism due to the defeat of the Islamic State as well as US-led airstrikes on Al-Shabaab. <i>Newsweek</i> reports that Western intelligence and security have primarily focused on Islamist terror over the past two decades, which has allegedly taken the focus off of the increasingly deadly right-wing groups.</p>
      <p>Anti-Defamation League statistics suggest that right-wing extremists were responsible for <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5552547/antifa-extremists-terrorist-organization-trump/">73.3 percent of the deaths</a> stemming from violent extremism between 2008 and 2018. According to an Anti-Defamation League statement reported by <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-wants-declare-antifa-terrorist-organization-even-though-right-wing-extremists-have-been-1451444?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter"><i>Newsweek</i></a>, white supremacists often use “extreme violence” to spread their hateful ideologies, as well as to “intimidate ethnic minorities” and “undermine democratic norms.”</p>
