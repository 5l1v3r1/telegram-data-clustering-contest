      <p>Sheriff John Williams, also known as “Big John,” was <a href="https://www.al.com/news/montgomery/2019/11/lowndes-county-sheriff-big-john-williams-shot-and-killed-in-the-line-of-duty.html">killed</a> outside a QV convenience store at the intersection of Highway 21 and Highway 97 on Saturday around 8 p.m., according to AL.com.</p>
      <p>Williams had responded to a call from the store owner who asked officers to disperse a group of people that were standing around outside the building.</p>
      <p>Just after 10 p.m., the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) <a href="https://www.bluealert.us/about_us">issued</a> a Blue Alert for the suspect identified as 18-year-old William Chase Johnson, who was reportedly driving a stolen vehicle which he later abandoned.</p>
      <p>However, Johnson <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/alabama-sheriff-killed-in-line-of-duty-suspect-in-custody">returned</a> to the scene of the alleged crime just after midnight carrying a handgun and was taken into custody. The ALEA then canceled the manhunt, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Saturday evening, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall announced the tragic loss on Twitter.</p>

      <p>The attorney general also <a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/Documents/news/AG%20Marshall%20Reacts%20to%20Loss%20of%20Sheriff%20'Big%20John'%20Williams.pdf">issued</a> a press release that read:</p>
      <blockquote>Sheriff Williams is the fifth line-of-duty death of an Alabama law enforcement officer to gun fire this year and the sixth to lose his life overall in our state over the last 11 months. Serving the public in the role of a peace officer is a difficult calling, fraught with peril, yet thankfully many Alabama men and women choose to answer the call, often time putting their lives in danger to protect us. It simply cannot be said enough that we owe these heroes our gratitude and our support. I know all Alabamians join me in passing along our condolences and prayers to Sheriff Williams’ family and to the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office.</blockquote>
      <p>Johnson, who is from Montgomery and the son of a law enforcement officer, was arrested and charged in August for possession of brass knuckles and being a minor in possession of alcohol. However, those charges were later dismissed, court records said.</p>
      <p>Michael Jackson, the district attorney for Alabama’s Fourth Judicial Circuit, called Williams a “great friend,” adding that “he was a great sheriff but an even better person.”</p>
      <p>“He really cared about the Black Belt. He came over to Selma many times to help fight the gang problem,” Jackson concluded.</p>
