      <p>BEIRUT: Known for having one of the most generous cuisines and warm hosting, the Lebanese people gathered around food and revolutionary talks since 11 AM on the coast from Akkar, Tripoli and Zgharta, to Anfeh, Jounieh, Corniche Ain El Mreisseh, Raouche, Saida, Marj Bisri and Sour.Under the expression “Khebez w Meleh” that translates to “Bread and Salt”, today’s national picnic symbolized the Lebanese people’s toughened bonds and hospitality. Dar Onboz, the Human Chain initiative and individuals collaborated in the nationwide event in order to revive the picnic folklore, a step accentuating Lebanon’s unity. "We’re encouraging all Lebanese people to have a brunch outside their houses, whether in the main meeting points all over the coast or in their villages, despite religions and political affiliations," Mona Demashkieh, one of the involved organizers in Ramlet El Bayda, shared with Annahar. Lidia El Hassan, an elderly protester, explained how she prepared 100 turkey and cheese sandwiches to serve whoever felt hungry. Amer Baalbaki, another protester, expressed his growing love to the country since the revolution sparked, adding: “I’ve been out on the streets for over a month now and all I want is a better Lebanon.”Demashkieh invited all picnickers to share their pictures on the hashtag #KhebezwMeleh to further encourage families and individuals to eat alongside their fellow citizens.Citizens also participated in traditional dances such as Dabke, old-school games and popular chants.Similar potluck picnics were organized by the Lebanese diaspora in Los Angeles, California.<i>Nessryn Khalaf contributed to this article</i> Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1069522-lebanons-labor-force-revolts">Lebanon's labor force revolts </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1069867-lebanons-outgoing-pm-blasts-presidents-party-over-delays"> Lebanon’s outgoing PM blasts president’s party over delays</a></p>
