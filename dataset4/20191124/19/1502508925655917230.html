      <h1>Explained: Why everyone is angry at Facebook over its political ads policy</h1>
      <h2>Some strategists voiced concerns to Facebook about how Google's decision would affect it</h2>

      <p>After Google announced restrictions on political advertising this week, campaign strategists in Washington quickly turned their attention to a different company: <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook.</a></p>
      <p>Some strategists voiced concerns to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook </a>about how Google’s decision would affect it, said two people who talked to the company. They told <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook </a>that if it followed Google by limiting how political campaigns target audiences, it would hurt their ability to reach unregistered voters and make it tougher for smaller organizations to collect donations online, the people said.</p>
      <p>The conversations added to the pressure on Facebook as it weighs how to handle political advertising. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, has made it clear that Facebook will not fact check ads from politicians — even if they contain lies — in the interest of free speech. But the social network is discussing some ad changes, like restricting how precisely campaigns can reach specific groups, said three people briefed by the company.</p>
      <p>Facebook has made no final ruling on its political advertising guidelines, said the people, who declined to be identified because the discussions were confidential. On Thursday at a happy hour discussion with roughly 500 digital strategists, campaign officials and political operatives at Facebook’s offices in Washington, company executives were adamant that they would not make any news about political ads, said two people who attended the event.</p>
      <p>But Facebook risks being whipsawed by its indecision, especially since Google and Twitter have already rolled out revised political advertising policies ahead of the 2020 American presidential election.</p>
      <p>“Twitter fired the starting gun, and Google just cranked it up to 11,” said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital advertising strategist. “Now the pressure is on Facebook — they’re going to have to act.”</p>
      <p>Political advertising on social media and internet platforms has become particularly fraught in this election cycle because of how campaigns increasingly rely on the digital channels to spread their messages and reach voters. Yet few <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>are getting caught in that fray as much as Facebook.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, the company wants to curtail the spread of disinformation across its site. The practice of targeting specific groups with ads, known as “microtargeting,” can stoke disinformation because advertisers can inflame niche audiences who may be susceptible to tailored messages.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Facebook wants to avoid alienating the groups and candidates who depend on its platform for fund-raising and organizing. So in trying to find a way to please everyone on the issue, Facebook has managed to please no one.</p>
