      <h4>Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja</h4>
      <p>The family of former Kogi State governor, late Prince Abubakar Audu, has set plans to commemorate the fourth year anniversary of his death, listing renaming of a building in Abuja as well as Christmas season charity for his kinsmen, as part of plans.</p>
      <p>Son of the late politician, himself a governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the recently held election, Prince Mustapha Audu, who disclosed plans to the family to journalists in Abuja over the weekend, said the family is determined to sustain its patriarch’s legacy and name.</p>

      <p>The younger Prince Audu, who is also known as Mona, said the building hitherto known as the Millennium Builders’ Plaza in the Central Business District of Abuja would be renamed as ‘Prince Abubakar Audu House’ at an event, which would soon be held in Abuja.</p>
      <p>According to Prince Audu, his father, who lived his life to ensure a comfortable life for the people of Kogi State, would be sad to see that election violence still persists in the state, charging all Nigerians to do away with violence, especially when what is involved is earthly.</p>
      <p>“It is wrong for Nigerians to kill each other over election matters, we should emulate past and current leaders who will never put their ambition ahead of the people. People like Prince Abubakar Audu, people who sacrificed themselves for the masses. That’s what we need, leaders who are dedicated to the development of their states and their people.</p>
