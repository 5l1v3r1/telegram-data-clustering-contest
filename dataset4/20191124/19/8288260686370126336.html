      <h1>‘Inevitable’ - The Leeds United claim that will surprise West Brom fans</h1>
      <h2>Latest West Brom news includes former Leeds striker's bold promotion prediction</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:17:43+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United are winning the ‘mental’ side of the Championship promotion battle – and it’s ‘inevitable’ they will knock West Bromwich Albion off top spot soon.</p>
      <p>That’s the view of former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford who thinks the Whites have got the upper hand despite <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/slaven-bilic">Slaven Bilic’s</a> side enjoying a two-point lead over them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">The Baggies</a> kept their place at the Championship’s summit with a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/slaven-bilic-press-conference-live-17298589">dramatic victory over Sheffield Wednesday at The Hawthorns.</a></p>
      <p>A goal apiece for strike pairing Hal Robson-Kanu and Charlie Austin at either end of the game saw off the 10-man Owls, who equalised through a penalty from Steven Fletcher.</p>

      <p>Leeds ensured they kept up on the pressure on Albion with a late win of their own, Matt Pearson's late own goal condemning Luton Town to a defeat.</p>
      <p>Albion have been beaten only once in the league so far - by Leeds back in October - and Beckford reckons they will be worried by the form of their leading promotion rival.</p>
      <p>Beckford said on LUTV: "You know what, West Brom will be looking over their shoulders thinking 'wow, what more can we do?'</p>
      <p>"They will be worrying about what's happening over here, rather than us worrying about what's happening down there.</p>
      <p>"I think in terms of the mental game, Leeds United are winning all day long.</p>
      <p>"West Brom, I think are going to go through a blip and when they do, they are really going to start worrying because [Preston], although they lost today, are a team that have been on form as well as us.</p>
      <p>"So it's inevitable in my opinion that we're going to go top and Preston are going to end up putting a lot of pressure on West Brom as well."</p>
