      <p>Hundreds of 'acutely ill' passengers were rushed off a cruise ship after a Norovirus outbreak onboard.</p>
      <p>Some people who had been on the Norwegian Joy were evaluated by paramedics after the 16-day cruise that left Florida stopped at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro.</p>
      <p>Those seeking medical attention disembarked the docked cruise ship and are being evaluated by paramedics of the Los Angeles Fire Department, reports <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Norwegian-Cruise-Line-Ship-Docks-in-San-Pedro-After-Multiple-People-Become-Ill-565399312.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_LABrand&amp;__twitter_impression=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">NBC Los Angeles.</a></p>

      <p>"Our ship had been dealing with a Norovirus outbreak the last couple days, but none of the passengers suspected that it was as bad as it was.</p>
      <p>"Apparently hundreds of people were acutely ill on the ship."</p>
      <p>A statement from the Los Angeles Fire Department said: "LAFD personnel continue to examine "several persons who have been ill" while aboard the currently docked cruise ship, which is disembarking passengers.</p>
      <p>"A yet to be determined number of those ill passengers desiring further medical assessment or ambulance transport are still being evaluated on shore by LAFD Paramedics.</p>
      <p>"No patients are currently displaying life-threatening symptoms."</p>
      <p>The Norwegian Joy has a guest capacity of 3,804 passengers and was refurbished earlier this year after being built in 2017.</p>
      <p>It also has 1,821 crew, according to the Norwegian Cruise line website.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Norwegian Cruise Line told Mirror Online: “The safety, security and well-being of our guests and crew is our number one priority.</p>
      <p>"As such, we operate at the very highest public health standards.</p>
      <p>"During Norwegian Joy’s Panama Canal sailing, a few guests on board experienced a stomach related illness.</p>
      <p>"To mitigate any impact of this rare occurrence, we implemented stringent sanitation procedures.</p>
      <p>"As always, we will continue to monitor this situation.”</p>
