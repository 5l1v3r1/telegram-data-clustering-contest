      <h1>John Hurst honoured as Everton pay tribute to Harry Catterick</h1>
      <h2>John Hurst became the 30th name engraved on the Dixie Dean Memorial Award on Friday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Prentice</a></address>
      <p>John Hurst became the 30th name engraved on the Dixie Dean Memorial Award on Friday night - and the first from Harry Catterick's last great side since Joe Royle collected it in 2006.</p>
      <p>Just yards from where Dixie scored his record-breaking 60th league goal, the great man's grand-daughter, Melanie Prentice, presented the silver trophy to Hurst in Goodison Park's Captain's Table lounge.</p>
      <p>The presentation was made as part of the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> Heritage Society's tribute to Harry Catterick, days before the legendary Blues boss would have celebrated his 100th birthday.</p>
      <p>There were contributions from Catterick's daughter Joyce, John Moores' grandson Lord Grantchester, Blues stars Derek Temple and Terry Darracott, the authors of two Catterick biographies, Gavin Buckland and Rob Sawyer and a rendition of the Ballad of Dixie Dean by Gerry Murphy.</p>
      <p>And, of course, John Hurst.</p>
      <p>The Dixie Dean Memorial Award was created by the Echo in 1980 to commemorate the achievements and the legacy of the man whose name it bears - and significantly, on its front, it bears the legend "For Sportsmen in The Great Tradition."</p>
      <p>Hurst was a hugely appropriate winner.</p>
      <p>Only 16 players in Everton history have made more appearances than the polished defender - but it was the manner in which Hurst performed in those 404 appearances which made him stand out.</p>
      <p>He was an FA Youth Cup winner in 1965, a League Champion in 1970 - and holds a unique place in Everton history as the first player ever to be introduced as a substitute, replacing Fred Pickering in August 1965.</p>
      <p>He was denied a stunning introduction against Stoke City by an over-zealous referee.</p>
      <p>"Hurst headed into goal brilliantly," ran a contemporary report "only to find the score disallowed by the blast of the referee's whistle a split second before the score could have become legal."</p>

      <p>Shades of Clive Thomas and Graham Poll.</p>
      <p>Hurst was diagnosed with hepatitis on the eve of the 1968 FA Cup semi-final, yet bounced back to play in the final at Wembley.</p>
      <p>And he was ever present for the next two seasons, actually leading the scorers' charts after the opening two games of the title-winning 1969-70 campaign.</p>
      <p>The peerless Ivan Ponting, in his Everton Player by Player book, summed up Hurst's qualities.</p>
      <p>"John Hurst could be guaranteed not to turn a drama into a crisis," he wrote. "The tall, leggy, centre-back possessed one of the coolest heads in football, and when pressure mounted on the Everton goal, he would be found at the centre of the storm, defusing the danger efficiently and unfussily before seeking a chance to set up the Blues next attack.</p>
      <p>"Yet 'Gentleman Jack', the quietest man inside the Goodison dressing room, did his job so unobtrusively that few public plaudits came his way. Inside the game, however, there was no lack of recognition amongst his peers. He was respected as an impeccable professional who offered class and consistency in equal and ample measure.</p>
      <p>"When he returned to Everton for a spell as youth coach during the 1990s the new generation of Blues could not have wished for a more impeccable role model."</p>
      <p>The Dixie Dean Trophy used to be presented every year at the Echo Sports Personality awards.</p>
      <p>But those dinners halted it has become a more occasional presentation â€“ usually on special occasions, like Friday's tribute to another true Everton great, Harry Catterick.</p>
