      <h1>‘Blair Witch’ Arrives on PlayStation 4 on December 3rd With Additional Content</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:20:11+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Bloober Team has announced that their game based on <i>Blair Witch</i> in, well, <b><i>Blair Witch</i></b> (<a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3581384/blair-witch-review-pc/">read our review here</a>), will be headed to the PlayStation 4. Currently available on PC and Xbox One, the game will be coming December 3rd to the PS4, along with additional content in the form of the “Good Boy Pack”. The content presumably involves your dog Bullet, who accompanies you on your journey.</p>
      <p><i>Blair Witch</i> takes place in 1996 — three years before the 1999 film. When a young boy disappears in the Black Hills Forest near Burkittsville, Maryland, you, as Ellis, a former police officer with a troubled past, joins in the search. What starts as an ordinary investigation soon turns into an endless nightmare as you confront your fears and the Blair Witch, a mysterious force that haunts the woods.</p>
