      <p>Broxburn Athletic will travel to Premiership outfit St Mirren in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.</p>
      <p>The East of Scotland Premier Division are the lowest ranked side still in the competition and will get the chance of a pay day in Paisley.</p>
      <p>The Brox have reached the fourth round in their maiden Scottish Cup campaign following victories over Tynecastle, Girvan, East Stirlingshire and Cowdenbeath prior to yesterday's dramatic late triumph against Inverurie Loco Works.</p>
      <p>Zander Miller struck the 84th minute winner in the Highlands for Brian McNaughton's men.</p>
      <p>Livingston, meanwhile, will host League One side Raith Rovers which sets up a clash with their former boss John McGlynn.</p>
      <p>Ties will be played on either January 18 or 19.</p>
