                      <p>United fans however, are of the opinion, that if the ball had gone in the nets while Liverpool were playing, VAR would have awarded a handball to keep the table toppers at the top spot.</p>

                            <p>Half and hour before full-time, Manchester United would have happily taken the one point. However, with 3 points merely 3 extra minutes away, it is understandable why fans are upset with the events that took place tonight. Unfortunately, the hypothesis that VAR would have made a wrong decision to keep Liverpool at the top does not justify the fans demand for VAR to wrongly send another side home pointless.</p>
