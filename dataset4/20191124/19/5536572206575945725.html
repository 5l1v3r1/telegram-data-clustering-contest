      <p>Mason Rudolph is having a rough few weeks.</p>
      <p>During the Steelers last game against the Browns, he got his helmet snatched off and hit over the head with it and would receive a $50K fine from the league.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, he got benched for playing badly and his back-up in Devlin Hodges showed what he had almost immediately as he tossed a 79-yard TD.</p>

      <p>Rudolph was 8-16 for 85 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception as Pittsburgh mustered just three points in the first half against a winless Bengals team.</p>
