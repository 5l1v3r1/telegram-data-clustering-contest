      <p>Troubled AFL footballer Jesse Hogan has been involved in a car crash at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Jesse Hogan was driving in Perth yesterday morning when he crashed into a parked car.</p>
      <p>The vehicle flipped onto its side and a concerned witness called an ambulance to the scene.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the Fremantle forward avoided serious injury but was taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>He has since been sent home and will miss pre-season training with the Dockers today.</p>
      <p>This latest setback comes after Hogan was limited to 12 games in 2019 through injury.</p>
      <p>It isn’t expected to have a significant impact on his preparation for next season.</p>
