      <h2>A draw against the Bundesliga's bottom side has increased the pressure</h2>

      <p>Borussia Dortmund's 3-3 draw at home to the Bundesliga's bottom side, Paderborn, on Friday has increased the pressure on Lucien Favre.</p>
      <p>Dortmund did come back from three goals down to salvage a point but that did little to reduce the criticism aimed at Favre, who's in a tight spot heading into Wednesday's Champions League game against Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The Swiss coach's future remains in the spotlight. Various reports in the German media say Hans-Joachim Watzke and Michael Zorc, Dortmund's CEO and sporting director respectively, met after the Paderborn game to discuss Favre.</p>
      <p>Thy spoke about the possibility of firing him after a string of poor results, but above all because of the manner of the side's performances. However, they decided to give him more time.</p>
      <p>Dortmund's chiefs don't want to rush into a decision, even though Favre now knows every game is a final. He needs results. Defeat against would be another black mark against his name.</p>
      <p>The German press have been tough on him. Bild, for example, said "Dortmund are light years away from their main objective," while Die Welt said the team "cannot continue like this."</p>
