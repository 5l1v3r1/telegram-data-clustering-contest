      <p>Arlene Foster says she has no regrets over not temporarily stepping down as first minister to avoid the collapse of powersharing.</p>
      <p>Sinn Fein pulled the plug on the devolved executive in January 2017 when Mrs Foster refused to stand aside for six weeks to facilitate an investigation into her role in a botched green energy scheme.</p>
      <p>The late Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at her decision – a move that precipitated the powersharing crisis, which has left Northern Ireland without a functioning government for almost three years.</p>
      <p>Asked if she regretted her stance, given what has followed, she told the PA news agency: “No I don’t, because I mean you could fill your life full of regrets about x, y and z.</p>
      <p>“But I think when you look back at what happened at that time, it was the right decision.”</p>
      <p>Reflecting on her four years at the helm of the DUP, Mrs Foster acknowledged it had been a “rollercoaster”, invoking the Charles Dickens line from A Tale Of Two Cities – “it was the best of times, it was with worst of times”.</p>
      <p>“Certainly, it has been a rollercoaster and challenging at times,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But you know, it is good to have the support of my colleagues, it’s certainly good to lead from the front.</p>
      <p>“And we had that election, of course the last general election (2017), where we got the biggest ever vote for the Democratic Unionist Party, a wonderful endorsement, not just of the party yes, but obviously for the Union as well – a very strong statement for the Union.”</p>
      <p>The RHI was designed to encourage businesses and farmers to switch to eco-friendly wood pellet boilers by offering a subsidy to buy the sustainable fuel.</p>
      <p>But errors in its design meant applicants were paid more than it actually cost them to buy pellets, creating a “burn to earn” incentive which left Stormont facing a multi-million pound overspend bill.</p>

      <p>Mrs Foster was the minister in charge of the scheme during its inception and implementation.</p>
      <p>The findings of a public inquiry, chaired by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, are anticipated to be published in the coming months.</p>
      <p>“We have had the public inquiry now in relation to the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme, we will get the public inquiry results soon,” said Mrs Foster.</p>
      <p>“I think there’ll be a lot in there from which we will have to learn and adapt in the future.</p>
      <p>“And I think we should take the public inquiry report and very much look at what it recommends and then move forward from there.”</p>
