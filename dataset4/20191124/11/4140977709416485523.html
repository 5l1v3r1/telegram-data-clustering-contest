                      <h3>Gareth Bale greeted with boos on his Real Madrid return after Wales flag controversy</h3>
                      <p>Gareth Bale was introduced into the match in the 66<sup>th</sup> minute of the match against Real Sociedad. The fans immediately began booing him and they got even louder as he made his way onto the pitch.</p>

                          <p>Every single one of his touches were met with boos. The fans couldn’t care less that one of his touches led to Luka Modric scoring Real Madrid’s 3<sup>rd</sup> goal of the night. They were happy letting the winger known that he was no longer welcome in the club.</p>

                            <p>Gareth Bale’s commitment to the club has often been questioned. Especially since he missed Real Madrid’s last 6 matches to injury but was miraculously fit enough to help his country qualify for the Euro 2020.</p>
                            <p>Manager Zinedine Zidane has chosen to distance himself from the controversy saying he only cares about what the winger does in a Real Madrid jersey.</p>
                            <p><i>“Things can happen outside but we have to look inside the club. What happens outside doesn’t bother us,” </i>he said before the match.</p>
