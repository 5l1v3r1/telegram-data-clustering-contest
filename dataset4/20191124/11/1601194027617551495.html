      <p>Former World Heavyweight Champion Booker T has labeled <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kevin-owens">Kevin Owens</a> as the real deal and stated that he should be at the top of the card at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a>. Speaking on his podcast ‘Hall of Fame’ (H/T <a href="https://www.mandatory.com/wrestlezone/news/1154635-booker-t-calls-kevin-owens-the-real-deal-praises-his-in-ring-work">WrestleZone</a>), Booker T praised the former Universal Champion and said that he is glad to see him do well in the company.</p>

      <h4>Booker T heaps praise on Owens</h4>
      <p>Owens has had his fair share of success in WWE, winning the Intercontinental Championship twice, the United States Championship thrice and the prestigious Universal Championship once.</p>
      <p>However, the Prizefighter hasn’t won a title in over two years now and Booker T hopes that Owens will get back to the top – which is where he deserves to be.</p>
      <blockquote>“Kevin Owens is the real deal, he’s a guy that goes on to perform at a very, very high level and to see his rise from the indie scene working so hard out there on that scene for so many years…</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“I am just glad to see Kevin Owens back in the saddle and hopefully ascend back to that position where I think he belongs – and that is at the top of the card.”</blockquote>

      <h4>The rise of Kevin Owens</h4>
      <p>Before joining WWE, Kevin Owens became one of the hottest acts in pro-wrestling in the independent circuit. The Canadian won accolades wherever he went and is fondly remembered by Ring of Honor fans for his epic feud with El Generico (now Sami Zayn) in the company.</p>
      <p>After his time in the indies, he joined WWE NXT in August 2014 and had a successful period there. He was crowned the NXT Champion after he defeated Sami Zayn at NXT TakeOver: Rival in February 2015 and then went on to make his debut on RAW in May that year.</p>
