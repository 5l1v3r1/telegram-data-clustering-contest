      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>India beat Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs on Sunday</li>
        <li>The pink ball Test in Kolkata is now the shortest Test in India in terms of balls bowled</li>
        <li>It was also India's record 7th successive victory at home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>47 minutes is all it took for India to complete their utter domination of Bangladesh in the teams' maiden Day-night Test in Kolkata which ended with an innings and 46 runs victory for the hosts. Having already won the 1st Test by an innings in Indore, India have now swept the 2 Test series which was incidentally their last in 2019.</p>
      <p>While BCCI and its president Sourav Ganguly left nos tone unturned in spreading the word about the historic pink-ball Test, with the match ending in just over 2 days seemed like an anti-climax. However, it was still enough time to leave us with a number of statistical highlights:</p>
      <p><b>968</b> - This was the shortest Test ever (in terms of the number of balls bowled) to be played in India, beating Afghanistan's maiden Test vs the hosts in 2018 that lasted 1028 balls. Even though the Afghanistan Test had ended within 2 days, a number of stoppages resulting from players being hit in the Kolkata game meant that the match went on for longer despite a lesser number of overs (161.2 vs BAN | 171.2 vs AFG) being bowled.</p>
      <p><b>19/20</b> - This is the 1st home victory for India where their spinners haven't picked up a single wicket with all 19 Bangladesh wickets to fall going to the seam trio of Ishant Sharma (9), Umesh Yadav (8), Mohammed Shami (2). This is also the most number of wickets picked by Indian pacers in a home Test beating the previous highest of 17, also at Eden Gardens, vs Sri Lanka in 2017.</p>
      <p><b>1</b> - Ishant Sharma (9/78) and Umesh Yadav (8/82) made history on Sunday by making it the 1st instance of 2 India fast bowlers picking up 8 or more wickets in the same Test.</p>
      <p><b>0</b> - India ended 2019 without losing a single Test, winning 7 out of 8 games played. Virat Kohli's team started the year by winning a historic series win in Australia, courtesy a draw in Sydney and then never looked back, clean sweeping West Indies (2-0), South Africa (3-0) and Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Also, India became the only team in the history of Test cricket to win 4 consecutive matches by an innings margin. But this and a few more stats are covered <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/india-bangladesh-pink-ball-test-series-win-virat-kohli-ms-dhoni-1622157-2019-11-24">here</a> and <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/pink-ball-test-team-india-world-record-4-successive-innings-win-virat-kohli-captaincy-record-1622160-2019-11-24">here</a>.</p>
