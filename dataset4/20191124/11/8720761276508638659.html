      <p>Long-time Slashdot reader <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/~Ammalgam">Ammalgam</a> is the founder and editor of a Microsoft cloud news site called <i>The Redmond Cloud</i>. He writes: <i>In a recent document, Microsoft outlines <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-deprecated-features">a whole bunch of features in Windows 10 that they are not only not developing anymore but, wait for it, might remove</a> from future versions.<br/><br/>Their words:<br/><br/><i>Every version of Windows 10 adds new features and functionality; occasionally we also remove features and functionality, often because we've added a better option. Below are the details about the features and functionalities that are no longer being developed in Windows 10. For information about features that have been removed, see Features we removed.</i> <br/><br/>These features are no longer being actively developed, and might be removed in a future update. Some features have been replaced with other features or functionality and some are now available from other sources.</i></p>
