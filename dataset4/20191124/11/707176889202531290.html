      <h2>Worst repression in years as Baghdad veers away from democratic promise</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:00:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chloe Cornish</a></address>
      <p>Sixteen years on from the fall of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, Iraqis are once again facing state crackdown on dissent — this time from their democratically elected government.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/208eebfa-f8c7-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">brutal suppression of protests </a>since the beginning of October has seen Iraqi state security forces and unidentified gunmen kill more than 325 people and wound at least 15,000. The worst repression in over a decade, it is the clearest sign yet that the Baghdad government is veering away from its democratic promise, analysts say.</p>
      <p>“The coercive power of the state has been deployed to suppress valid political expression,” said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at Chatham House. “This bodes very poorly for Iraq’s democracy going forward.”</p>
      <p>The government is using tactics common to authoritarian regimes around the world, further undermining Iraqis’ fragile faith in the democratic system installed by US-led forces after the 2003 invasion. From shooting demonstrators dead to policing Facebook for government criticism and blanket shutdowns of internet access, the repressive approach has elicited unflattering comparisons with Iraq’s former dictator.</p>

      <p>“We are in a so-called democratic country, so why did they take down Saddam if that’s what we will get now?” said Baan Hashem, 49, a civil servant at the education ministry who has been on the front line of the protests.</p>
      <p>The state’s repression goes beyond the pitched battles between security forces and demonstrators hurling rocks which have at times left the squares of Baghdad and southern cities resembling war zones. Activists have gone missing, protesters say they have been arrested and then coerced to sign documents renouncing their participation in demonstrations, while others have been jailed after posting support for the protests on social media.</p>
      <p>Belkis Wille, Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch, called it a “multi-tiered approach” to curtailing the freedom of expression Iraqis have enjoyed since Saddam’s ousting, sending a “strong signal that open criticism of the government is no longer acceptable”.</p>

      <p>Digital tools of repression have become equally important. Social media access was restricted for 50 days, during which internet access was cut altogether for almost two weeks, according Alp Toker the founder of NetBlocks, an internet freedom monitor. At one point a nightly internet curfew was introduced, while intermittent targeted restrictions are an almost daily occurrence.</p>
      <p>“It’s Orwellian. You have internet coming up during these speeches [by top politicians] for a matter of minutes then going down again so the public can’t respond,” Mr Toker said.</p>
      <p>Much of the public anger has fallen on prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who as commander-in-chief is ultimately in charge of the security response. Analysts and some Iraqi officials say that while Mr Abdul Mahdi may not have ordered the brutal crackdowns, he is accountable.</p>
      <p>“Adel is not a securocrat,” said Mike Knights, a security analyst at the Washington Institute. “He has delegated the counter-protest operations to his security cell, partly out of disinterest and partly to keep his hands clean.”</p>
      <p>An economist with links to Washington and Tehran, Mr Abdul Mahdi was elevated to the premiership after last year’s elections in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cbf2cbee-c707-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9">a deal between the two biggest parliamentary blocs</a>, widely thought to have been backed by Iran.</p>
      <p>That perceived link to Iran is contentious for many people. The protests have been concentrated in mostly Shia Muslim areas of the capital and southern Iraq, and the majority of the protesters are unemployed young men. Aggrieved with the political class for squandering Iraq’s oil riches, the young men and women are especially angry with Shia Islamist politicians and former Shia militia leaders whom they see as loyal to Tehran over Baghdad.</p>
      <p>Ms Hashem said she was tired of politicians “who employ [Iraq’s] money for their own needs or to implement a foreign agenda to destroy this country”.</p>
      <p>Shia Islamists lead the two biggest blocs in Iraq’s fractious parliament — one answering to Moqtada al-Sadr, a populist former militia leader, and the other headed by Hadi al-Ameri, another ex-militia commander representing factions linked to an umbrella of state-sponsored paramilitary groups called the Popular Mobilisation Forces.</p>
      <p>Iraqis were especially dismayed this month by reports that Qassem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite overseas unit, has steered backroom deals in Baghdad to prop up the government and repress protests. Signalling Iran’s discomfort at the mass protests, Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has blamed American and western intelligence forces for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3463589e-ffc7-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">protests in Iraq and Lebanon</a>.</p>
      <p>For Mr Dodge at Chatham House, the rise of Iran-backed political figures in Iraq has coincided with the state’s intolerance for dissent. “The men of violence have come centre stage,” he said.</p>
