      <p>Having collaborated with other oil companies in Nigeria previously, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is calling for partnerships among organisations, governments, and industries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punchng.com/collaboration-with-iocs-sustaining-nations-gdp-nnpc/">Punch</a> reports that the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari while speaking at the 16th induction ceremony of the Institute of Petroleum Studies, University of Port Harcourt, said that partnerships are needed to enhance the sustainable growth of the country.</p>
      <p>Kyari who was represented at the event by the NNPC Group General Manager, Research and Development, Ben Norhile stated that without collaboration, businesses could go extinct like the dinosaur.</p>
      <p><b>While stating that the</b> corporation had continued to work in collaboration with various international partners like Shell, Total, Chevron, Addax and Nigerian Agip Oil Company, Kyari explained that the concept of collaboration must be taken seriously by industries, universities and government if the country must make progress.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We must work together; we must collaborate if we are going to progress. Let us, therefore, take the concept of collaboration seriously so that we can achieve our goals as a country. When you collaborate, new ideas and energy are created.</i>
