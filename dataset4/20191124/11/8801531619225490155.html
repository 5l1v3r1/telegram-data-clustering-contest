      <h1>'Film Made Without Consent': Delhi Court Stays Release Of Biopic On Former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:38:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author">LIVELAW NEWS NETWORK</a></address>
      <p>A Delhi Court has stayed the release of a movie titled "Chanda: A Signature that Ruined a Career", allegedly a biopic on the life of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar.</p>
      <p>In an order passed in this behalf on Saturday, <b>Additional District Judge Sandeep Garg </b>restrained the filmmakers and all other stakeholders from using Kochhar's name directly or indirectly. They have also been precluded from screening, exhibiting or marketing the movie online on or off-line, whole or in part or in any other form, without Kochhar's consent and until the next date of hearing. They have also been restrained from publishing or commenting on Kochhar's life until further orders.</p>
      <p>The said movie, produced by Manoj Nandwana and S Akhileswaran and directed by Ajay Singh, was supposed to be screened at Goa Film Festival on November 28.</p>
      <p>Seeking injunction against its release, Kochhar's Advocates Vijay Aggarwal and Naman Joshi had submitted that the film was made without Kochhar's consent and that the filmmakers never approached her to seek permission to use her name or make a film about her life.</p>
      <p>Strong objections were made against the title of the film and the film itself, allegedly having the underlying tone and tenor of Kochhar's life.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, the Petitioner also objected to the open remarks, made by lead actress of the film Gurleen Chopra, claiming that the film was about an alleged mistake made by Kochhar and how it ruined her life.</p>
      <p>Kochhar has been under the scanner of CBI and ED for committing alleged irregularities in sanctioning loans to the Videocon Group. The investigation in the matter is still underway and the charge sheet has not been filed yet.</p>
      <p>Stating that such remarks may prove fatal to Kochhar's case which was still at the stage of investigation, her counsels submitted,</p>
      <p>"<i>she is being shown as a culprit though the trial is pending and no charge sheet has been filed against her and trial is yet to begin. Making of such alleged bio-pics and their release as well as promotional interviews and material vilifying the Plaintiff are extremely prejudicial to the investigation as well as the trial.</i>"</p>
      <p>While granting interim relief to Kochhar, the court posted the matter for further hearing on November 26.</p>
