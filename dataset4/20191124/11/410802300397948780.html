      <p>Calm and confident, Esther Muinjangue, Namibia’s first woman to run for president, says she feels a “wind of change” softly blowing through the southwest African country which goes to the polls on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>From her modest home in a quiet suburb of the capital Windhoek, Muinjangue spoke to AFP about her bid to “restore dignity” to the country’s 2.45 million inhabitants — struggling through an economic recession after nearly 30 years of independence from South Africa.</p>
      <p>“You hear a lot of people complaining about the (ruling) SWAPO-led government,” she said on Saturday, before heading into the final day of campaigning for her National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) party.</p>
      <p>“There was apathy among the youth,” added the 57-year-old former social worker. “But now you see at every rally… more and more young people coming on board.”</p>
      <p>Namibia’s South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO) has remained in power since its founder Sam Nujoma won the first democratic election in 1990, after decades of guerrilla war against colonial rule.</p>
      <p>But President Hage Geingob, elected in 2014, has faced increasing disgruntlement amid SWAPO’s inability to redistribute wealth to the majority black population.</p>
      <h3>‘Empty glass’</h3>
      <p>Namibia “was like a full glass of water,” said Muinjangue, but “the first president brought it down half, the second drank further”</p>
      <p>“So when Hage took over we were already in the mess that we are in today.”</p>
      <p>Despite vast mineral wealth, abundant fish reserves and a growing tourist industry, Namibia remains the world’s second most unequal country after South Africa, according to the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Low commodity prices and drought caused the economy to slump in 2016, and Geingob has come under fire for expanding his cabinet at the expense of other sectors.</p>
      <p>Muinjangue is campaigning on a promise to cull the bloated government and invest more in education, health and affordable housing.</p>
      <p>She said Namibia has resources to take care of its needs, but corruption has taken root.</p>
      <p>“Top leaders… are selling the land, they are selling the country, they are selling mines to foreigners.”</p>
      <p>NUDO won just two percent of the vote in 2014, when SWAPO’s Geingob swept to victory with more than 87 percent.</p>
      <p>But Muinjangue was confident her party would perform better this time and that disgruntlement with the regime could drive more voters towards the opposition and break SWAPO’s two-thirds parliamentary majority.</p>
      <h3>‘Expecting miracles’</h3>
      <p>“We are expecting a lot of miracles to happen this year,” said Muinjangue.</p>
      <p>As a member of Namibia’s minority Herero group and daughter of an exiled politician, Muinjangue learnt to challenge the status quo against a backdrop of tradition.</p>
      <p>“I have never been conforming to the norms of my community,” she said, describing it as an environment “where women are expected to have their places in the kitchen”.</p>
      <p>Wearing a traditional Herero dress, Muinjangue spoke of women’s empowerment, gay rights and legalising abortion in Namibia.</p>
      <p>Her ascent to the NUDO presidency touched off a “paradigm shift” that prompted members of the majority Herero party to question “their old way of thinking”.</p>
      <h3>‘Same as the Holocaust’</h3>
      <p>Aside her new role as party leader, Muinjangue continues to fight for reparations for the German-led slaughter of thousands of Herero and Nama people who rose up against colonial rule in 1904-08.</p>
      <p>Germany — which controlled Namibia before South Africa took over in 1915 — has so far failed to officially apologise for the massacre and refused to pay any compensation.</p>
      <p>Muinjangue, whose grand-father was “the product of a German soldier” and a Herero woman, said the case deserves “exactly the same” treatment as the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>She blasted SWAPO for being soft-handed in its negotiations with Germany.</p>
      <p>While Germany formally handed back Herero and Nama remains to Namibia in 2018, it maintains bilateral aid makes up for compensation.</p>
      <p>“Being a social worker, social work is a value-based profession, and one value of social work is social justice.</p>
      <p>“So for me it’s more about social justice. It’s more about why is the German government treating our issue different from the issue of the holocaust – which is exactly the same.”</p>
