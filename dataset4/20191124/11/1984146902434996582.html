      <p>It doesn't look like it's just viewers who have gone off Ian Wright since I'm A Celebrity kicked off as bookies now have him well out of the running to win this year's show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> returned to our screens a week ago and before this year's lineup had even entered the jungle, bookmakers across the country were tipping football legend Ian to triumph Down Under.</p>
      <p>But after quite a lot of moaning and a spat with comedian Andrew Maxwell over food, the Arsenal and England striker has fallen away significantly in the betting.</p>
      <p>Over the past few days the favourite to win I'm A Celeb has switched between Caitlyn Jenner, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-jacqueline-jossa-crying-17307360">Jacqueline Jossa</a> and Roman Kemp and it is now Capital Radio host Roman who is the hot tip to win with <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/g/508793/Outright.html">William Hill,</a> ahead of the eliminations beginning this week.</p>
      <p>Punters who backed early favourite Ian will be cursing as he is now one of the big outsiders at 25/1.</p>
      <p>“Ian Wright has been a spectacular disappointment and there will be a large number of disappointed football fans,” said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams.</p>
