      <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Philadelphia Eagles</h3>
      <p>The Eagles are ever-so-slight favourites for this one but Seattle are bringing a perfect 5-0 away record, a superstar MVP-calibre quarterback and a whole load of trouble with them to 'The Linc'.</p>
      <p>Pete Carroll’s men have had a week off after ending San Francisco’s unbeaten start with a tense overtime win – their second successive OT victory – to put them on 8-2 and suddenly vying to be the very best in the NFC.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Russell Wilson is a huge part of that, but against the Niners it was also a welcome emergence of a Seattle pass rush that sacked Jimmy Garoppolo five times. Jadeveon Clowney made a huge impact in that, even scoring a touchdown on a fumble recovery.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that the famed 'Legion of Boom' is back, but it’ll be an extra concern for Carson Wentz if Eagles starting right tackle Lane Johnson misses out and rookie Andre Dillard, who usually plays on the left, has to switch sides and try and stop the marauding Clowney.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the ball, Philly are struggling to move the chains and put up points – especially last week against the Patriots when they were missing their top two receivers and star running back. They could have Jordan Howard and Alshon Jeffery back to provide a welcome spark, but if they're slowed or can't play, that spells trouble.</p>
      <p>They should improve the Eagles if fit, but the Seahawks look a real threat right now and Wilson has been borderline unplayable at times. After a week off they can take the spoils here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best bet: <a href="https://m.skybet.com/american-football/nfl/event/24946852?aff=9546&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_NFL_WEEK12_2311">Seahawks to beat the Eagles at Evens</a></b>

      <h3>Dallas Cowboys @ New England Patriots</h3>
      <p>It’s attack versus defence at Foxborough as Dallas bring their league-leading offence to the home of the current champions and their top-ranked defence, which allows just 249 yards a game and has conceded just nine touchdowns all season.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys average almost 200 yards a game more than New England allow, and with the Patriots’ one defensive frailty being stopping the run then it’ll be interesting to see the plans being laid for Cowboys rusher Ezekiel Elliott.</p>
      <p>Tom Brady’s not been at his very best of late – wide receiver Julian Edelman threw the only touchdown of their win over Philadelphia last week - but Brady knows how to win ugly and has never been one for padding stats. He'll take the 'W' any way it comes.</p>
      <p>A decent amount of money has been reported on backing the Cowboys in the US, but those punters may have missed the Patriots’ phenomenal home record, as they’re unbeaten since October 2017 at Gillette Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys have also flattered with the gaudy yardage numbers, as they've turned all those yards into just six wins so far, and six wins against teams that have mustered 15 victories between all of them this season.</p>
      <p>I can’t help thinking that those backing Dallas are doing so more through hope than expectation, and the Pats should have more than enough to take this one at home.</p>
      <p>We’ll take them to win it by a touchdown.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best bet: <a href="https://m.skybet.com/american-football/nfl/event/24946795?aff=9546&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_NFL_WEEK12_2311">Patriots to beat the Cowboys (-6.5) at Evens</a></b>

      <h3>Green Bay Packers @ San Francisco 49ers</h3>
      <p>This could be the biggest game of the year so far, as the 8-2 Packers travel to Santa Clara to face the 9-1 Niners.</p>
      <p>After both missed out on the pay-offs last season, these two famous old clubs are now the top two sides in the NFC with two excellent young head coaches in Kyle Shanahan and Matt LaFleur who should provide a fascinating tactical watch.</p>
      <p>Aaron Rodgers may be the best player on show, but he’ll have to go some to get any joy out of the league’s best pass defence and second-tightest unit conceding just 15.5 points per game.</p>
      <p>You couldn’t hide the smile on Rodgers’ face earlier in the season when Green Bay’s new defence hit the ground running, but they’re not down in 28th and heading back towards the good old days of putting the entire game on their star quarterback’s shoulders.</p>
      <p>Green Bay are 25th against the run and with San Francisco having three solid options in their run-first offence they will look to try and profit from both possession and penetration on the ground. They’ve struggled in their last three games so will look to get back on track here.</p>
      <p>It’s the start of what could be a historically difficult run of fixtures for the Niners with trips to Baltimore and New Orleans next up, so they badly need a win here to start that run.</p>
      <p>They’re three-point favourites to do so, mainly because of home field advantage as there’s not much between them – San Francisco have a far more dominant defence but the Packers do have that man Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Rodgers versus the NFL’s top pass defence is a mouth-watering prospect, but it’s hard to see him putting up enough points to cover what his own slumping defence will allow. Especially if San Fran getting their running game going as it’ll also chew up the clock and limit his chances to shine.</p>
      <p>We’re taking the hosts to be the last man standing in a brutal fist fight of a game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best bet: <a href="https://m.skybet.com/american-football/nfl/event/24946796?aff=9546&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_NFL_WEEK12_2311">San Francisco 49ers -2.5 and Under 47.5 Total Match Points at 2/1</a></b>
