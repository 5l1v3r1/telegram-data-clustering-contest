      </p>
      <p>Joseph ‘Jowie’ Irungu, has disclosed that life behind bars is tough and that his stay there has opened up his eyes, revealing to him who his true friends are.</p>
      <p>In a candid interview with<i> Sunday Nation</i>, Jowie says he has been deserted by those he thought were close to him – except his family and a few friends .</p>
      <p>His ageing parents who travel from their home in Nakuru County to visit him in at Kamiti Maximum Prison every week without fail are perhaps his greatest source of strength in his harrowing ordeal behind bars that has so far lasted 431 days.</p>
      <p>“<i>At least every Tuesday, my parents come to see me. They travel from Nakuru to Kiambu every week</i>,” Jowie stated in his first interview since he was first implicated in the murder of Ms Monicah Kimani.</p>

        <p>Speaking on life behind bars, Jowie who was once engaged to Jacque Maribe revealed that he is detained in isolation and only allowed to chat with his visitors for just 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>“<i>Since this is a maximum-security prison, you can imagine someone who left Nakuru at 6am to come and see you early is given only ten minutes to talk to you. And it’s strictly 10 minutes” </i>Jowie stated.</p>
        <p>Jowie told the Local Daily, that he is one of only nine prisoners kept under isolation at Kamiti Maximum prison adding that some prison warders are “outright bullies”.</p>

          <p>Being detained in isolation means that he never gets to speak to any other prisoner throughout his stay or interact with fellow inmates in any way.</p>
          <p>His constant companions in his cell are mosquitoes that only add to his misery.</p>
          <p>“Staying here has made me realise that mosquitoes can be ruthless…Mosquito nets are a luxury. Your work is to fight with the insects, crushing them against the wall.” added Jowie.</p>
          <p>Among those who have not shunned Jowie are friends who take the long flight from as far asDubai hoping to spend time with him only to be told that their visits cannot last beyond 10 minutes.</p>
          <p>“<i>Some of my friends think they’ll have 30 minutes or one hour of speaking with me. They are given 10 minutes and wonder: ‘We took a flight to come talk to you for 10 minutes, surely?</i>” Lamented Jowie.</p>
          <p>“<i>Now is when you know people who care, people who matter, people who have your back</i>,” he said.</p>
          <p>His application for bail in October 2018 was denied by the court who described him as a dangerous man who posed a great danger to witnesses should he be released.</p>
          <p>His co-accused and former news anchor Jacque Maribe was however released on a Sh2 million bond or Sh1 million cash bail, with three sureties.</p>
