      <h1>‘It went exactly to plan’ - Pat Lam reveals how he plotted Bristol Bears’ victory in Brive</h1>
      <h2>Director of Rugby's reaction to Friday night's win.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:52:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">John Evely</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Bears may be top of the Gallagher Premiership and now at the summit of their Challenge Cup pool but they have been slow starters in many of their games this season. </p>
      <p>It has made life hard work at times for the Bears, coming back from 17 points down to defy the odds and beat Exeter Chiefs in their last outing in the league. </p>
      <p>In light of the early trend Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam revealed he emphasised all week the importance of starting rapidly when travelling to Brive’s Stade Amédée-Domenech - a happy hunting ground for the newly promoted side who like the Bears had not lost at home all season. </p>
      <p>That was until the whirlwind which are this on-from Bristol side blew into town like a tornado and left again having battered the hosts 0-36, leaving behind a metaphorical trail of destruction as bad anything in recent history in the Corrèze region.</p>
      <p>Friday night’s thrashing was the first time Brive have failed to score a point in a home game since 1962.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the match Lam said: </p>
      <p>“We said we said when you come to France you have to go early. If you start bad it can be a long day so we put a huge emphasis on that with our structures and our moves that we did to really come at them quickly. </p>
      <p>“It worked to plan to go 24-0 up [in the first 24 minutes]. </p>
      <p>“The only way they were going to get into their game was from stupid penalties from us and we had a bit of that as well. </p>
      <p>“All in all in was a really controlled performance from us.” </p>
      <p>“I am really proud, that was a big effort. Winning any game in France is tough and especially against a team that hasn’t lost here in 18 months, I know a lot of their players and there is a lot of quality in that team as well.</p>
      <p>“The [wet] conditions were very difficult but we trained really well this week.</p>
      <p>“You saw me last week, I wasn’t happy because we were up and down in the game, but the boys have been outstanding all week. They arrived at every meeting and every training session and brought their best and that is the celebration we have had out on the field this weekend. </p>
      <p>“I have told them that is the standard we have to hit every week.”</p>
      <p>Bristol now sit top of Pool 4 with 10 points from a possible 10, with Stade Francais, this next opponents in the European competition, second having beaten Zebre 12-13 in Italy on Saturday. </p>

      <p>Only Welsh side the Dragons have achieve back-to-back bonus point wins in the tournament this year to top Pool 1.</p>
      <p>Toulon, Edinburgh, and Leicester Tigers currently sit top of the other groups. </p>
      <p>Reflecting on Bristol’s start to their European campaign before switching back to the Gallagher Premiership this weekend when they face London Irish at Ashton Gate on Sunday, Lam reflected.</p>
      <p>“There is still a long way to go obviously but we made it clear we want to win this competition and we are aiming to get five points from every game, but also make sure we have a good points differential; that is why we were disappointed last week, yes we scored 59 points but we conceded 21. </p>
      <p>“Today was outstanding to score 36 points and not allow them in because that point differential means a lot ot us.”</p>
