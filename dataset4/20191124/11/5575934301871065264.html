        <li>The key takeaway is that delivering <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/brexit-eu-agrees-to-delay-until-january-2020-2019-10">a much-delayed Brexit</a> is still front and centre, with no radical proposals taking the spotlight.</li>

      <p>The Conservative Party unveiled their manifesto for the next five years on Sunday ahead of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/uk-will-hold-general-election-december-mps-back-snap-poll-2019-10">the December 12 election.</a></p>
      <p>Boris Johnson promised to “get Brexit done” on time and “put more money back in people’s pockets” by not raising taxes in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>The prime minister dedicated a substantial chunk of his speech to criticising opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>Here are the key pledges.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To revive the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before Christmas so that a much-delayed Brexit can happen on time on January 31, 2020. The bill seeks to turn the preexisting withdrawal agreement into UK law.</li>
        <li>Not to raise income tax, national insurance payments, or value-added tax (VAT.)</li>
        <li>To give childcare services £250 million-a-year.</li>
        <li>To enact a new digital tax on multinational firms.</li>
        <li>To hire 50,000 more nurses.</li>
        <li>To make available £6.3 billion so that homes can be upgraded to make them more environmentally friendly and efficient.</li>
        <li>To roll out a Australia-style points-based immigration system.</li>
        <li>To scrap NHS hospital car parking charges for millions of people.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Imagine the relief the whole nation will feel if we do this – if a Conservative majority is returned on 12 December so we can get Brexit done. Uncertainty ended, investment unlocked, a nation moving forward once again,” Johnson will say at the official unveiling at 2 p.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>The manifesto is titled “Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain’s Potential.”</p>
      <p>Michael Gove MP <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-gove/no-further-brexit-delay-says-uk-minister-gove-idUKKBN1XY08E">promised on a BBC chat show Sunday morning</a> that the Conservative Party would not ask the EU for another extension.</p>
