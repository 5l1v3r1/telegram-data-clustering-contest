      <p>Xiaomi MIUI adds clipboard sharing feature<br/>3.7 (73.33%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>Chinese manufacturing giant, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>, is consistently working on its in-house MIUI Android skin. The company is preparing features such as Focus mode, Vientiane screen custom image &amp; Class schedule features for Xiaomi MIUI 11. This new system also has features like notifications’ sound effect changes with time. Now, the latest report from Liu Ming, MIUI Product Manager, claims that MIUI now has a new clipboard sharing feature. Liu Ming said: “I saw that there are users sharing the clipboard. In fact, we have already supported it. We only need the computer to install the Xiaomi cloud service client.”</p>

      <p>He shared an image of the shared clipboard button which is in the lower right corner of the keyboard. Next to the text of the clip is the cloud logo. The new clipboard sharing feature will allow users to copy and paste contents across platforms. The capability of the clipboard to work across platforms makes it “shared clipboard”. This means that whatever we copy on our Xiaomi phone can be easily pasted on other compatible platforms.</p>
      <p>However, for this feature to work, the user will need the Xiaomi cloud service client. It will require that you log-in with the same Mi account on both platforms. This will certainly be a massive one for users who work across different devices. Although, Liu Ming said MIUI already supports it, the feature is not public yet. While we wait for the global dark mode on Xiaomi MIUI 12, clipboard sharing may be another feature to watch out for.</p>
