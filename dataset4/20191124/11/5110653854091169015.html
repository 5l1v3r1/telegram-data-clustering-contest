      <p>The NFL wasted little time in beginning to punish the Browns and Steelers for the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-live-score-updates-highlights-thursday-night-football/r6xyx2seq57j1h7obct9hqik3">wild Nov. 14 night brawl</a> that included Cleveland defensive end Myles Garretttearing off the helmet of Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and hitting him in the head with it.</p>
      <p>Latemorning on Nov. 15, a little over 12 hours after the fight, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-suspension-helmet-swing-browns-steelers-fine/p6a4y3lcs6841h6yyhthae7t2">the league handed down a series of fines</a> and suspensions for players involved. Those penalties were largely upheld during the NFL's weeklong review of the situation, which concluded Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>Below is an updated list of all suspensions and fines as a result of the Steelers-Browns melee.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'THAT'S ASSAULT': <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-hit-mason-rudolph-helmet-steelers-browns-melee/t713now08dkh16omshy9umg2f">NFL players react to Myles Garrett's helmet-swinging attack</a></b>
      </p>
      <h3>Steelers vs. Browns brawl suspensions, fines</h3>
      <h4>Myles Garrett: six games plus 2019 playoffs</h4>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Myles Garrett received the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-helmet-suspension-legal-action/m0x1ofyyrljw107t55wyl5117">longest suspension of anybody involved</a> in the brawl. The third-year defensive end's suspension will keep him out of the final six games of the 2019 season and any potential postseason games. The NFL decided to uphold the suspension despite an appeal by Garrett, who had a meeting with thecommissioner's office Nov. 20. During the meeting, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-mason-rudolph-browns-steelers-brawl/cvj7kgdhkncm18mv7px1sdznd">Garrett reportedly accused Rudolph of using a racial slur</a> to incite the fight. Rudolph has denied those claims. <a href="https://twitter.com/MylesLGarrett/status/1197666686536736768?s=20">Garrett tweeted Thursday night</a> that "I know what I heard," although he also said that Rudolph's alleged actions "do not excuse my lack of restraint in the moment."</p>
      <p>The suspension is without pay and came with a fine of an undisclosed amount. Officially, the suspension is for violating "unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct rules,as well as fighting, removing the helmet of an opponent and using the helmet as a weapon."</p>
      <p>He was also fined $45,623, according to NFL Network.</p>
      <p>“Last night, I made a terrible mistake,’’ Garrettsaid in a statement Nov. 15. “I lost my cool and what I did was selfish and unacceptable. I know that we are all responsible for our actions and I can only prove my true character through my actions moving forward. I want to apologize to Mason Rudolph, my teammates, our entire organization, our fans and to the NFL. I know I have to be accountable for what happened, learn from my mistake and I fully intend to do so.”</p>

He was also fined$35,096.</p>
      <p>Pouncey threw multiple punches and kicked Garrett's helmet while he was on the ground.</p>
      <p>The suspension is without pay and came with a fine of an undisclosed amount. Officially, the suspension is for "fighting, including punching and kicking an opponent."</p>

      </p>
      <h4>Larry Ogunjobi: One-game suspension</h4>
      <p>Pushing Rudolph to the ground after Garrett's helmet swing will cost Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi one game.</p>
      <p>The suspension is without pay and came with a fine of an undisclosed amount. Officially, the suspension is for "unnecessary roughness, specifically for shoving an opposing player to the ground during an altercation."</p>
      <h4>Mason Rudolph: No suspension, $50,000 fine</h4>
      <p>Rudolph, who helped cause the fight by attempting to take Garrett's helmet off, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-suspension-myles-garrett/1e9p6e3p28vd31bqe2bgpmst3y">won't be suspended</a> but did receive a $50,000 fine, <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1198298418822684672">according</a> to NFL Media.Garrett accused Rudolph of starting the fight by calling him a racial slur, which Rudolph has denied.</p>
      <p>Rudolph did not admit fault while addressing the media with a prepared statement Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>“The way I saw it, on the final play of the game with the game in hand the way it was, it had been, we had already lost two of our players to targeting penalties from the game,’’ Rudolph said. “As I released the ball, I took a late shot. Did not agree with way he took me to the ground and my natural reaction was to get him from off on top of me. And again, I should have done a better job of handling that situation.”</p>
      <h4>Other Browns, Steelers: Fined $3,507 apiece</h4>
      <p>Fines were announcedNov. 23 for 29 players who entered the "fighting area."</p>
