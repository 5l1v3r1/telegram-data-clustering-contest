      <p>A common adornment of the well-apportioned baby crib — protective cloth “bumpers” — have been linked to dozens of accidental infant suffocation deaths in recent decades, a new investigation revealed.</p>
      <p>Padded crib bumpers have been implicated by medical examiners in at least 35 baby deaths across the country, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/dozens-of-infant-deaths-have-been-tied-to-a-popular-baby-product-but-regulators-are-too-paralyzed-to-act/2019/11/23/c6348d68-f5a1-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html?wpisrc=al_news__alert-economy--alert-national&amp;wpmk=1">the Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The National Institutes of Health, American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all have warned the public against using bumpers for years, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>Still, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission has failed, until now, to rule that padded bumpers were to blame in the deaths.</p>
      <p>The commission has a new acting chairman — longtime commissioner Robert Adler —  who told the paper he plans to invite outside experts to come in and debate the safety of crib bumpers at a public hearing in early 2020.</p>
