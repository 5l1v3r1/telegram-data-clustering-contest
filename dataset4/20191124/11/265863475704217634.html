      <p>One other commenter wrote: ‘Their daughter’s virginity. Wtf isn’t their daughter at the table then? This is soooo “UGH” 🙄’</p>
      <p>A follower noticed that ‘Even in this screenshot, he looks like he still doesn’t get it lol He gone double-down defending that weird mess… I just know it.’</p>
