      <p>The Federal Government intends to inject N50 billion into the entertainment industry as its role in making sure the industry survives, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed disclosed this at the All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA) at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Sáturday.</p>
      <p>According to the minister, the government was set to commercialise the creative industry in Nigeria. He said the government knew that a lot went into the making of an industry and as such, it had resolved to prioritise commercialisation of the creative industry.</p>
      <p>Mohammed also said that together with the Minister for Communication, the government would clean up the advertising industry to make sure proper audience exist and are collated.</p>
      <p>He said: “A lot goes into making the industry from the creative industry to the artiste, the managers, platforms, sponsors, agents, marketers, investors and award concerts like this.</p>
      <p>“As we move into 2020, the successful commercialisation of the creative industry is our number one priority because it will create jobs.</p>
      <p>“It will also reduce crime, be a major source of foreign exchange and thereby reduce our dependence on oil.</p>
      <p>“We in government are tackling all impediments in the industry.</p>
      <p>“We are making cheaper and longer terms finance available for the industry, especially for infrastructure like concert halls across the city in the federation.</p>
      <p>“The issues that have plagued the country have now being put on the front burner by the Attorney-General.</p>
      <p>“There will be no more excuses; the use of music must be paid for.</p>
      <p>“The other big issue is the commercialisation of the digital economy. Data must be cheaper and owners of content must make their money from the use of their works.”</p>
