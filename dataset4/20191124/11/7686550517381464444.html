      <h1>Serious childhood illness more common than cancer, diabetes and AIDS combined</h1>
      <h2>Health experts and teachers have called the situation a crisis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:59:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>One-in-seven children develop a mental illness - more than the number with cancer, diabetes and AIDS combined, according to new research.</p>
      <p>They range from anxiety and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) to schizophrenia and depression.</p>
      <p>And neuro-developmental conditions could be getting missed in girls in particular because of "delayed detection." They tend to be diagnosed much later.</p>
      <p>The findings published in JAMA Psychiatry is based on 1.3 million Danish youngsters who were tracked from birth to 18 years of age.</p>
      <p>Corresponding author Professor Soren Dalsgaard, a child psychologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, said: "Worldwide, this nationwide study is the first, to our knowledge, of the incidence of the full spectrum of diagnosed mental disorders in childhood and adolescence."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year a study of NHS trusts found child referrals to mental health clinics in the UK rose by nearly 50 per cent over three years.</p>
      <p>The probe revealed 31,531 under 11-year-olds were sent by their school for treatment in 2018 - an increase of 10,406 from the 21,125 in 2015.</p>
      <p>Mental health experts and teachers called the situation a 'crisis' - with school staff even seeing youngsters 'headbutt walls on a daily basis'.</p>
      <p>Online bullying has been blamed for the rise in 'extreme mental health distress', which has caused some students to even attempt suicide on school grounds.</p>
      <p>Prof Dalsgaard's team found a total of 99,926 participants (15%) were diagnosed with a mental disorder before 18 years of age.</p>
      <p>They included 41,350 girls (14.6%) and 58,576 boys (15.5%). Anxiety was the most common diagnosis in girls (7.85%) and ADHD in boys.</p>
      <p>Girls had a higher risk than boys of schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and mood disorders.</p>
      <p>But boys were much more prone to mental illness at younger ages with incidence of ADHD peaking at eight compared to 17 for girls.</p>
      <p>The trend extended to intellectual disability and other developmental disorders - each tending to start at the age of five compared to 14 and 16, respectively, for girls.</p>
      <p>The overall risk of being diagnosed with a mental disorder before 6 years of age was 2.13% - and was almost twice as high in boys (2.78%) than girls (1.45%).</p>
      <p>Eating disorders were much higher in girls (1.8%) than boys (0.28%).</p>
      <p>Prof Dalsgaard said: "These findings suggest precise estimates of rates and risks of all mental disorders during childhood and adolescence are essential for future planning of services and care and for research."</p>
      <p>Previous estimates in the UK has suggested they effect about one in ten youngsters. The findings published in JAMA Psychiatry suggest the figure is much greater.</p>
      <p>Prof Dalsgaard said: "Since 1990, studies on the global burden of disease have continuously ranked mental disorders as some of the most impairing conditions worldwide."</p>
      <p>The Global Burden of Disease studies recently reported that in children and adolescents, mental disorders account for the most years lived with disability.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organisation has emphasised the strong need for age and sex-specific data on child mental health.</p>
      <p>Prof Dalsgaard said: "Knowledge about the epidemiology of mental disorders in children and adolescents is essential for research and planning of health services.</p>
      <p>"Surveys can provide prevalence rates, whereas population-based registers are instrumental to obtain precise estimates of incidence rates and risks."</p>
      <p>In the first study of its kind his team analysed all individuals born in Denmark between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2016 - including those who died during the study, possibly as a result of their mental illness.</p>
      <p>Prof Dalsgaard said: "This nationwide population-based cohort study provides a first comprehensive assessment of the incidence and risks of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence.</p>
      <p>"By 18 years of age, 15.01% of children and adolescents in this study were diagnosed with a mental disorder.</p>
      <p>"The incidence of several neuro-developmental disorders peaked in late adolescence in girls, suggesting possible delayed detection."</p>
      <p>He added: "We believe the novelty of this report is the comprehensive estimates of risks of diagnosed mental disorders throughout childhood and adolescence in a total nationwide population, and this adds new knowledge to the field of mental health.</p>
      <p>"The existing literature mainly reports prevalence rates in a population alive at a certain point, only obtaining data on surviving individuals, thereby potentially missing data on those with the most severe psychopathologic diagnoses who did not survive until start of the study."</p>
