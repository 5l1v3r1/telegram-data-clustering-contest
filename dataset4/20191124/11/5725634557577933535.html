          <b>Foreword</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>25 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own, </b>by Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, published 7/2/19, featured a "group of retirement stocks that includes both pure income plays and growth companies, with a focus on very-long-term performance and durability.”</p>
      <p><b>20 Quality Dividend Stocks</b> (yielding roughly 4% or higher), published 8/13/18,by Brian Bollinger, "...should fund at least 20 years of retirement, if not more. They have paid uninterrupted dividends for more than 20 consecutive years, appear to have secure payouts and have the potential to collectively grow... dividends to protect investors’ purchasing power."</p>

        <b><b>Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Analysts Estimated 13.34% To 38.59% Net Gains For Ten</b> <b>Top Kiplinger November Reliable Retirement Dogs Into 2020</b></b>
      </p>
      <p>Five of ten top Kiplinger most reliable retirement stocks by yield were among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. (They are tinted gray in the chart below). Thus, the yield-based forecast for these mid-October dogs was graded by Wall St. Wizards as 50% accurate.</p>

          <b>The Dividend Dogs Rule</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, "underdogs".</p>

      <p>To quantify top dog rankings, analyst mean price target estimates provide a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield metrics, analyst median target price estimates became another tool to dig out bargains.</p>

      <p>The five lowest-priced top-yield Kiplinger most reliable retiree dividend dogs as of November 21 were: Magellan Midstream Partners LP; Dominion Energy; Duke Energy Corp.; International Business Machines; Union Pacific Corp., with prices ranging from $61.17 to $174.17.</p>
      <p>Five higher-priced Kiplinger top yield most reliable retirement dividend dogs as of November 21 were: McDonald's Corp.; Public Storage; American Tower Corp.; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; Home Depot Inc., whose prices ranged from $192.35 to $218.54.</p>
      <p>The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' "basic method" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of change.</p>
      <p>The net gain/loss estimates above did not factor in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions. Consult your tax advisor regarding the source and consequences of "dividends" from any investment.</p>
