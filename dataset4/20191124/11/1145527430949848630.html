      <p>NCP sources said the tweet was an indication that the nephew of party chief Sharad Pawar had spurned all efforts to persuade him to rescind his shocking move to back the BJP.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the month-long political impasse ended dramatically in Maharashtra with the BJP's Devendra Fadnavis returning as the chief minister, backed by the Sharad Pawar-led-NCP.</p>
      <p>The development came less than 12 hours after NCP chief Sharad Pawar announced unanimity over the choice of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to be backed by NCP and Congress.</p>
      <p>The NCP on Saturday evening removed Ajit Pawar as the party's legislature unit leader after he joined hands with the BJP.</p>
