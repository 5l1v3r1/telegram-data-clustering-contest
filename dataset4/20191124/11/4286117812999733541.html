      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar has tweeted that party chief Sharad Pawar is his leader. In a tweet, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar also said that he would always remain in the NCP.</p>

      <p>Taking to Twitter, Ajit Pawar said, "I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb is our leader."</p>
      <p>Justifying his joining hands with the BJP, Ajit Pawar said that NCP's alliance with the saffron party would provide a stable government in Maharashtra for next five years.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the day, sources have told India Today TV that Ajit Pawar has refused to rethink his decision to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and become the deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>The Maharashtra deputy chief minister also told NCP leaders Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse Patil that tie-up with the BJP in the NCP's interests. NCP sharing power with the BJP is in its better interest, Ajit Pawar reportedly told the NCP leaders.</p>
      <p>NCP leader Jayant Patil on Sunday met Ajit Pawar and said his party is trying to convince Ajit Pawar that he is still a part of the NCP family.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media outside NCP Chief Shard Pawar's Silver Oak's residence, Jayant Patil said, "I have come here to meet Ajit Pawar and convince him that he is part of our NCP family. Let see what happens. Those who try are never defeated. All our MLAs are in touch with us."</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar's statement on Twitter has come hours after the Supreme Court issued a notice to him, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the Centre and the Maharashtra government on a petition filed by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine against the Maharashtra Governor's decision to swear in the BJP leader in the wee hours of Saturday.</p>
      <p>A bench of Justices NV Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna also asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to produce letters of the Governor tomorrow at 10.30 am for passing orders.</p>
