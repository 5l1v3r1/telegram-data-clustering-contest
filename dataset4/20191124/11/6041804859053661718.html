      <p>The first promo video of Mahesh Babu’s Sankranthi outing ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’ was out and Rashmika Mandanna’s fans were for a surprise that she wasn’t there in it even for a brief period. Rest of the lead characters including Vijayashanthi and Prakash Raj had a dialogue or two, Rashmika wasn’t even seen in the teaser.</p>
      <p>Maybe, there would be a special teaser cut for the heroine or maybe not. When she acted with Vijay Deverakonda, Rashmika was treated so well as a star heroine. Both Vijay and his team made sure that she felt like a part of the team.</p>

Now, it has been totally different when it came to <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/extraordinary-character-representing-mahesh-babu/">Mahesh Babu</a>‘s movie.</p>
