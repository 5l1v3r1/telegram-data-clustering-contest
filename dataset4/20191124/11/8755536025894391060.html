      <p>“I have fantastic nieces and nephews. Two of them texted me this morning already just for a chat. I have a great relationship with them and I can relate to them really, really well.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite his choice to be self-partnered, Francis said that he rarely feels lonely.</p>
      <p>“I don’t allow myself to. I am a great man for the radio. And I read quite a lot,” he said.</p>
