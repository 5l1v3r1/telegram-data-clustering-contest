      <h2>NCP sources said the tweet was an indication that all efforts to persuade Ajit Pawar had spurned.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:15:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Alok-Deshpande-256/" target="_blank">Alok Deshpande</a></address>
      <p>In a clear message sent to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) that he is not going to withdraw his rebellion, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as all the leaders of BJP who congratulated him on Saturday for taking oath along with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.</p>
      <p>“Thank you Hon. Prime Minister @narendramodi ji. We will ensure a stable government that will work hard for the welfare of the people of Maharashtra,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>In another tweet, Mr. Ajit Pawar said “I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb is our leader. Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable Government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the State and its people.</p>
      <p>“There is absolutely no need to worry, all is well. However a little patience is required. Thank you very much for all your support.”</p>

      <p>He also thanked BJP president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal along with BJP’s national working president J.P. Nadda.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ajit Pawar’s response to the BJP indicate that all attempts from the NCP to bring him back to the party have failed and he has decided to stay firm with his stand to rebel.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, NCP State president Jayant Patil and senior leader Dilip Walse-Patil held a meeting with him at his Mumbai residence. Both the leaders left the house without speaking to the media which was an indication that the meeting was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>His nephew and NCP MLA Rohit Pawar too on Sunday morning wrote an emotional post on social media site appealing him to come back.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Sharad Pawar tweeted saying, “There is no question of forming an alliance with @BJP4Maharashtra. NCP has unanimously decided to ally with @ShivSena &amp; @INCMaharashtra to form the government. Shri Ajit Pawar’s statement is false and misleading in order to create confusion and false perception among the people.”</p>
