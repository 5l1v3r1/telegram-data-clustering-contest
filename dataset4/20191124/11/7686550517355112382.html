      <p>A former soldier has been jailed for ten years for abusing schoolgirls whilst serving overseas in the British Army.</p>
      <p>Shane Townson, 58, was jailed for four counts of indecent assault on girls aged under 16 at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The former squaddie previously pleaded guilty to the offences at Colchester Magistrates’ Court in September.</p>
      <p>He has been put on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life after admitting four offences of indecently assaulting a girl under 16 dating back to the 1990s after he left the Army.</p>
      <p>Townson joined the Army in 1978 and left in 1993, and Essex Police started an investigation in February 2017, after receiving reports of sexual abuse between 1984 and 1995.</p>
      <p>The former British Army solider was also convicted for two other child sex offences committed while serving overseas.</p>
      <p>His victims were in their 30s when they contacted police and reported they were in Colchester where they were subjected to assaults.</p>
      <p>The reports were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police.</p>
      <p>Townson, from Cornwall, was interviewed by Devon and Cornwall Police where he made admissions about his crimes before being summonsed to court.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer DC Rachel Evemy said: “Townson subjected young girls to abuse over a lengthy period of time.</p>
      <p>“In 2017, they both bravely came forward as adults and spoke about the abuse they were subjected to as children.</p>
      <p>“Townson was then interviewed made he made admissions about his crimes.</p>
      <p>“I would like to praise both women for their courage and I would like to thank other key witnesses for their assistance with this case.</p>
      <p>“Townson will now face the consequences of his actions in prison.</p>
      <p>“I hope this case will encourage other victims of recent and non-recent abuse to come forward and report information.</p>
      <p>“We will take your report seriously and we will look to bring sexual offenders like Townson to court.”</p>
