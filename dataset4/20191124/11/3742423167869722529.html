      <p>Eating a mango is like taking a mini vacation in your mouth—all of a sudden, you’re transported somewhere sunny and warm, even if you’re not. But as tasty as they are, they can be a little tricky to cut up. Luckily, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=-6dPnL0uJho&amp;feature=emb_logo">instructional video</a> demonstrates how to cut off big, clean slices from a mango around its flat, oval pit (yes, mangoes have pits).</p>
      <p>The video’s a bit shaky, so if you’re prone to vertigo, consider yourself warned. Also, enjoy the credits.</p>

      <p>Once the mango is cut, if you want to cube it, you can score it in a box pattern and push the cubes of the skin by inverting your slices. That part isn’t shown in the video, but <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-cut-a-mango-2216765">this photo tutorial</a> covers it well.</p>
