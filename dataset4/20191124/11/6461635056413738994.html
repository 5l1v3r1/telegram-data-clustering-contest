      <h1>Barcelona scouting German duo as summer defensive reinforcements</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona are scouting two young Germany internationals</h3>
      <p>Despite having arguably the best goalkeeper in the world in Marc-André ter Stegen, Barcelona have kept just 5 clean sheets all season. That is how poor the defence has been this season. In other words, signings need to be made.</p>
      <p>The leakiest side of the defence has been the right. Nélson Semedo has been sketchy at the back, while Sergi Roberto hasn’t been used much at right-back. Moussa Wagué just made his debut, but he is not expected to keep getting playing time.</p>
      <p>Barça need an upgrade at the right-back position. Currently, there are <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/22/football/1574437101_387757.html"><b>two players</b></a> being scouted. RB Leipzig youngster Lukas Klostermann and Germany star Joshua Kimmich. While Kimmich has been a target for a long time, Klostermann is an emerging star.</p>
      <p>Klostermann relies on his build and physique to overpower opposition wingers, breaking up counter-attacks. Defensively, he is among the best right-backs in the world. But for such a big player, the 23-year old right-back is also quite fast.</p>
      <p>The ex-Bochum man is considered to be the next Stephen Lichtsteiner. A star of longevity, Lichtsteiner was a Barça target during the right-back crisis after Dani Alves’ departure. Maybe Klostermann could the solution for Barça.</p>
      <p>As for Kimmich, he is already a superstar. He has won 4 Bundesliga championships, along with 2 DFB-Pokal titles. At 24, Kimmich has also won the Confederations Cup with Germany. The Bayern youth academy graduate is among the most talented and versatile players in Europe.</p>
      <p>Kimmich is a very good passer of the ball, evidenced by his 90% pass accuracy this season. He can play in a number of different positions, but is primarily a right-back. As a Guardiola protégé, he has some of the Barça flavour in his game.</p>
      <p>For example, Kimmich likes to overlap as a right-back, unlike Klostermann. His ball-retention skills are fantastic, and he is also very quick. Joshua Kimmich is the complete footballer in the 21st century, in every way imaginable.</p>
      <p>When it comes to feasibility, both Joshua Kimmich and Lukas Klostermann will be expensive. Klostermann will come cheaper despite the fact that RB Leipzig are anything but a selling club. Kimmich could fetch up to double his market value.</p>
      <p>When comparing both players, it is clear that Kimmich wins the battle. Given the right kind of negotiations, he can be brought in. But it is unclear whether such a big move for a player in a position with three existing squad members is necessary.</p>
      <p>Instead, Barça should try and develop Wagué as the right-back for the future, with Klostermann providing much-needed competition to Semedo.</p>
