      <p>At least €230k worth of structural work needs tobe carried out at the Oireachtas offices in Leinster House to fit a new printer.</p>
      <p>The state-of-the-art machine cost €808k and was delivered last December.</p>
      <p>It had to be placed in storage because officials miscalculated the measurements, and it would not fit into either of the two printing rooms on Kildare Street.</p>
      <p>Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act to the Irish Times have revealed that the storage costs amounted to €2k a month, after an initial gratis period of four months.</p>
      <p>The total cost amounted to €12k when the printer was finally installed on September 28 this year.</p>
