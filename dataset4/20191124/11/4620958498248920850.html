      <p>A delivery truck appears to have got into a bit of a squeeze on Friday afternoon at the Petro-Canada gas station in Tsawwassen.</p>
      <p>The video here, originally posted to the Tsawwassen Loop Facebook group by Bryan Grant, shows the truck idling with its four-way flashers on while seemingly wedged under the gas station’s canopy.</p>

      <p>A group of dudes stand looking up at it, apparently trying to figure out how to get it unstuck.</p>
      <p>A bystander can be heard saying that they should perhaps let some air out of the tires so that they might free the thing.</p>
      <p>How it got there – all the way under the canopy – was a mystery, so we reached out to the Petro-Canada hoping that they might shed some light on it for us.</p>
      <p>Nobody who was working on Friday was available, nor was a manager.</p>
      <p>We also reached out to Worta, the company whose name is on the van. They’re not around on weekends.</p>
      <p>However we did find out one thing that everyone is certainly dying to know:</p>
      <p>No, the truck is no longer under the canopy!</p>
      <p>Sleep well, friends.</p>
