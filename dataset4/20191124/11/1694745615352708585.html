      <h1>OMG: Watch John Legend, Kelly Clarkson, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani Sing "Neon Moon"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:20:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">Mekishana Pierre</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kelly-Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> has given her <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/The-Kelly-Clarkson-Show"><b>Kelly Clarkson Show</b></a> audience <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-lea-michele-white-christmas-cover-46815532">phenomenal duets before</a>, but we are loving her latest star-studded "Kellyoke," which features her peers from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Voice"><b>The Voice</b></a>!</p>
      <p>The daytime host invited Blake Shelton, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Gwen-Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/John-Legend">John Legend</a> to perform Brooks &amp; Dunn and Kacey Musgraves's "Neon Moon," a country jam that perfectly suits <i>all</i> of their voices. Even Carson Daly got in on the fun, playing guitar with Clarkson's show band. We know the four coaches <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/destiny-rayne-katie-kadan-tiny-dancer-performance-video-46768567">are usually battling for contestants</a> on their competition show, but we would totally be into seeing more of their group performances. Just sayin'!</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time the judges have gotten together for a musical extravaganza; the five performed <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/voice-coaches-more-than-words-performance-video-46618020">a beautiful rendition of Extreme's 1990 ballad "More Than Words"</a> that knocked us all off our feet. We're not knocking any of Clarkson's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/the-kelly-clarkson-show-music-cover-videos-46607055">other "Kellyoke" covers</a>, but damn but this one takes the cake. Since we already know <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/is-kelly-clarkson-show-renewed-for-season-2-46918135">the daytime show is getting a second season</a>, can we put in a request for more of these group performances? Thank you!</p>
