        <b>A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a prisoner at Cloverhill Prison.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The man, aged in his late 30s, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/man-dies-incident-cloverhill-928349">died after an “incident” involving another prisoner</a></b> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said they were called to the prison shortly after midnight. The man was treated by emergency services but was pronounced dead a short time later.</p>
      <p>A second man was treated for minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster carried out a postmortem on the man’s remains yesterday.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said the results would not be released for operational reasons.</p>
      <p>This morning, a man in his 50s was arrested at the prison on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>He is being held at Clondalkin Garda Station.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Irish Prison Service insisted that all practicable measures are being taken to ensure the safety of prison inmates.</p>
      <p>It said no prison system can be completely free of violence.</p>
      <p>The IPS is also investigating the death along with the Inspector of Prisons.</p>
