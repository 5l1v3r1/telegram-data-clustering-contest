      <h1>Marco Silva insists he is still the right man for Everton</h1>
      <h2>Manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a> is determined to find a way to solve <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/"><b>Everton</b></a>'s problems on the pitch even though his future at the club hangs in the balance.</h2>

      <p>A 2-0 home defeat to bottom side Norwich made it six losses in nine league matches and leaves the Toffees just four points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Factor in the forthcoming month from hell – with Liverpool, Leicester (twice), Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City all to face in their next nine matches – and Silva's position is precarious.</p>

      <p>He was not helped by a large number of Everton fans joining the away supporters in a chorus of "sacked in the morning" towards the end of the game, which was decided by goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/todd-cantwell/"><b>Todd Cantwell</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dennis-srbeny/"><b>Dennis Srbeny</b></a> – the Canaries' first on the road in 10 hours and 20 minutes of league football.</p>
      <p>Majority owner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/farhad-moshiri/"><b>Farhad Moshiri</b></a> has already sacked <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-martinez/"><b>Roberto Martinez</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ronald-koeman/"><b>Ronald Koeman</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-allardyce/"><b>Sam Allardyce</b></a> since assuming control of the club in February 2016.</p>
      <p>"I respect all the reaction," said Silva after hearing the crowd calling for him to go, with one fan loudly shouting "He's gotta go Bill" across the Main Stand to chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bill-kenwright/"><b>Bill Kenwright</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"But we have the confidence and we have to keep working hard to change because we came from good results before (three wins and a draw in the last five matches in all competitions).</p>

      <p>"We are trying to look for some consistency as a team and the last few results we did that but we didn't have the right performance to get the points.</p>
      <p>"We have to keep working hard and avoid the type of mistakes we made this.</p>
      <p>"If something goes against us in the game we have to show enough quality and be calm enough to take the right decisions.</p>
      <p>"It is just myself and the players on the pitch who can solve that.</p>

      <p>"My job is to analyse why this has happened again. I am concerned about what has happened on the pitch and what I can control is the situation and show my players why these things happened."</p>
      <p>Norwich's climb off the foot of the table was almost reduced to a footnote with doubts circling about Silva's future.</p>
      <p>But having registered their first league win since beating Manchester City in September, boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-farke/"><b>Daniel Farke</b></a> believes it could be a turning point.</p>
      <p>"The first 12 games were disappointing in terms of points, not performances," said the German.</p>

      <p>"The main part of the season starts now and the main part of the season is when the table is made.</p>
      <p>"When you come away from Everton with a clean-sheet win it is good for the mood.</p>
      <p>"If I'm honest we deserve a bit of luck. It is good for the confidence.</p>
      <p>"We are far away from competing for the Premier League title but if we repeat this performance on a weekly basis we have a chance of repeating a sensation at the end of the season."</p>
