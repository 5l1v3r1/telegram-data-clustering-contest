      <p>Two of the weapons were seized, alongside another knife, and seven officers were left with facial injuries, according to West Midlands Police.</p>
      <p>A dispersal order was used to clear the group of up to 100.</p>
      <p>A 13-year-old girl, a girl and a boy, both aged 14, and a 19-year-old man were held on suspicion of assaulting police.</p>
      <p>A 14-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of obstructing police.</p>
      <p>Investigators have asked anyone with any video or pictures of the incident to get in touch.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Ian Green said: "This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night-out at the cinema understandably frightened.</p>
      <p>"We [...] were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw tasers to restore order.</p>
      <p>"It's clear that some of those who went to Star City last night were intent on causing trouble."</p>
