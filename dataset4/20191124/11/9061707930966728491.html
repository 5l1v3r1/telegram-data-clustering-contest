      <p>Some hotels are made for romance.</p>
      <p>Whether it's parents desperate to escape mad family life for a night or a couple just wanting to change things up, weekends away can do wonders for any relationship.</p>

      <p>Here we highlight their top 10, which range from a Victorian fantasy castle to a glamorous boutique hotel, and quote the description from the guide itself.</p>
