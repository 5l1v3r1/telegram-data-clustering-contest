      <h1>Pokémon: Is Professor Oak Basically Ash’s Father in the New Anime?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:11:57+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Gramuglia</a></address>
      <p>From the beginning of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/pokemon/">Pokémon</a> anime, one mystery has remained prominent above all others: where is Ash's dad? We hear vague references to Ash's dad being on his own Pokémon journey, but we never see his face or learn his name. Of course, we know Ash's mom, Delia Ketchum, quite well, as well as the mentor that gave Ash his <a href="https://screenrant.com/pokemon-tv-show-reveal-baby-pikachu-story/amp/">Pikachu</a>, Professor Samuel Oak. We see Professor Oak as a young man, as a young boy in<i> Pokémon 4Ever</i>, as well as his extended family in the Alolan region.</p>
      <p>However, the new <i>Pokémon</i> anime has revealed, in a special program designed to promote the new series in the Galar region, a particular graphic that has people asking if Ash's father has been right in front of him the whole time. Is Professor Oak Ash's dad?</p>

      <h3>The Source of the Rumor</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pokemon-professor-oak.jpeg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=482&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The start of the rumor comes from a program advertising the new season of <i>Pokémon</i>. It presents a tree graph, illustrating the connection between the old and new characters set to appear in the special.</p>

      <p>The graph shows several familiar people in Ash's life -- Pikachu, Team Rocket, his mom -- all connected to Ash, by arrows, with little labels explaining what connection they have to Ash. As many have observed, Ash's mom and Professor Oak are in the same box on the chart, with the special indicating either that Professor Oak is like Ash's father or, potentially, <i>is</i> Ash's father.</p>
      <p>While on one hand, this chart could be indicating that Professor Oak is a father-like figure to Ash, there's another possibility: that Professor Oak genuinely is Ash's dad. If that's the case, then how is this possible -- and, more disturbing, what are the implications of this?</p>
      <h3>When Could Professor Oak Have Produced Ash?</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Young Samuel Oak was transported fifty years into the future by Celebi in <i>Pokémon 4Ever</i>. At the time, he looked approximately Ash's age, and, naturally, became close friends with Ash at a young age. Even after returning to his old time, he remembered the experience fondly, keeping hold of the notebook he kept during his time travel adventures close to his heart for years.</p>

      <p>This proves four core things: the first of which is that Professor Oak had to be in his fifties when he produced Ash (being that he was ten fifty years before Ash when on Pokémon journey -- when Ash was ten). Secondly, Professor Oak knew from which family Ash would be spawned, meaning that all interactions with any Ketchums in the past is colored because he'd know these people would create his childhood friend. Third, this means that Gary Oak is actually Ash's nephew, despite the two being the same age. Remember, Gay Oak is Professor Oak's grandson.</p>
      <p>Fourth -- most important of all -- is that everyone ignored the fact that Professor Oak is Ash's father, and, thus, it's possible that even Ash doesn't realize Oak is his dad, seeing his confusion whenever he sees Professor Oak with his mom. If Ash knew the professor was his dad, he'd never question why Oak was spending large portions of his time hanging out with his mom. This leads to a few uncomfortable questions about the relationship between Professor Oak and Delia Ketchum.</p>

      <p>Delia Ketchum and Samuel Oak's relationship has long been a topic of discussion among <i>Pokémon</i> fans. The two have hung out socially, visit each other regularly, and, though they live in different houses and have, presumably, a long friendship. However, if Professor Oak is Ash's dad, this colors all prior interactions the two have had. They aren't just friends. They produced a son!</p>

      <p>But this gets even more disturbing when you consider the events of the third <i>Pokémon</i> film, <i>Spell of the Unown</i>. In the movie, Professor Spencer Hale becomes obsessed with the Pokémon Unown. Depending on whether you watch the English or Japanese version, his wife either disappeared (possibly thanks to the Unown) or left Spencer because his Unown obsession tore the family apart. Of course, Hale gets spirited away by Unown, leaving Spencer's daughter, Molly, all alone.</p>
      <p>Delia knows Spencer because the two of them studied under Professor Oak years prior. Ash actually met Spencer Hale at a reunion they all had with Professor Oak. By this point, Ash and Molly were both alive, though Ash, being a few years older than Molly, actually remembers the interaction.</p>

      <p>Making matters even more complicated, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-facts-ash-mom-delia-ketchum/">Delia Ketchum was only 19-years-old when she gave birth to Ash</a>, meaning she's only 28 by the time the series starts. At the time Ash was born, Professor Oak was in his early 50s. This means that, if this theory is accurate, Samuel Oak, a middle-aged man, slept with his student, who at the time was either 19 or 18! Even ignoring the concerning power dynamics between a professor having his way with a student, the age dynamic between Professor Oak and Delia is incredibly concerning, especially considering that, thanks to <i>Pokémon 4Ever</i>, we know Professor Oak knows that Delia Ketchum would produce a boy he met in the future, meaning he'd explore a sexual relationship with Delia knowing Delia would produce Ash!</p>
      <h3>Is This Theory Possible?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Professor-Oak-More-About-Devotion.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It is highly likely that Professor Oak is <i>not</i> actually Ash's dad. The translation compares Professor Oak to Ash's family, because Professor Oak has served as a mentor figure to Ash. In some respects, he's a father figure. However, it's highly unlikely that Professor Oak is Ash's literal father, but, rather, like a father figure.</p>

      <p>The problem is Ash's family is not entirely by blood. Ash has often regarded Pikachu, his Pokémon, and his friends as part of his family. Often, he regards Professor Oak as "part of" his family. This doesn't mean that Professor Oak or Ash share any genetic traits in common. It just means that Ash sees his Professor as a father figure worthy of respect.</p>
      <p>Besides, there is also that contrasting theory -- reinforced by the <i>Pokémon Live</i> musical event -- that Giovanni, the head of Team Rocket, is actually Ash's father. There is more material to reinforce this theory than there is to indicate that Professor Oak is Ash's father. It's far more likely we will never know for sure the identity of Ash's genetic father. But in many ways, Professor Oak is Ash's patriarchal figure, someone who has guided and shaped Ash's life for the better. Much like Yondu from <i>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol 2.</i>, Professor Oak might not be Ash's father, but he's sure his daddy.</p>
