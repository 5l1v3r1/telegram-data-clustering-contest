      <h1>Not Your Keys: 92% of Institutional Investors Keep Crypto on Exchanges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:13:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrency</a> institutional investors overwhelmingly keep their wealth on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">exchanges</a> despite the inherent security risks, new data claims. </p>
      <p>Compiled by cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://research.binance.com/analysis/institutional-insights-2nd-edition">Binance</a> on Nov. 22, a survey asked 76 institutional investors who used its platform about their trading habits. </p>
      <h3>Exchange storage “most popular choice”</h3>
      <p>The survey was part of Binance’s Institutional Market Insights research, which is now in its second edition.</p>
      <p>Among the most surprising results was that 92% of participants chose to keep their crypto — Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stablecoin">stablecoins</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">others</a> — with trusted third parties, and not under their own control.</p>
      <p>The figure dwarfs much safer alternatives such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hardware-wallet">hardware wallets</a> and other <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cold-storage">cold wallets</a>. </p>
      <p>“Exchanges remain as the most popular choice for cryptoasset storage amongst our institutional and VIP clients at 92.1%,” Binance summarized. Researchers added:</p>
      <blockquote>“When moving to self-storage, cold wallets are the second most favored choice, given their improved safety and control. Third-party custody services were the least popular option at 2.6%.”</blockquote>
      <p>The 76 investors cannot be said to have significant exposure in terms of capital — over 50% had total crypto holdings of under 10 units of a coin. 10 BTC currently equals around $72,000.</p>
      <h3>Demands to take back control of crypto</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/round-up-of-crypto-exchanges-hack-so-far-in-2019-how-can-it-be-stopped">reported</a>, investors face significantly increased risk of loss and theft of coins if they remain in wallets to which they do not control the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/private-keys">private keys</a>. </p>
      <p>Exchanges, including Binance, continue to see hacks this year, while regulatory scrutiny can also see funds locked up without notice until an account owner provides personal identity data.</p>
      <p>Efforts to make investors aware of the need to control their money are mounting. On Jan. 3, the second annual <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/trace-mayer-get-your-bitcoin-off-exchanges-in-proof-of-keys-2020">Proof of Keys</a> event will challenge all Bitcoin holders to remove their funds from third-party wallets.</p>
      <p>The brainchild of advocate Trace Mayer, preparations for the move, which coincides with the anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, are already a common sight on social media.</p>
