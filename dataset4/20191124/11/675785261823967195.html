      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:02:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Buckland, http://www.facebook.com/MirrorCeleb</a></address>
      <p>K Pop singer and ex Kara band member Goo Hara has been found dead at home six months after trying to take her own life.</p>
      <p>Local news channels reported the 28-year-old star was found on Sunday evening at her home in Gangnam's Cheongdam neighborhood.</p>
      <p>In May this year the star apologised to her fans after trying to take her own life. Before her death she had just completed a tour of Japan with new solo material, including Midnight Queen.</p>
      <p>A grieving fan wrote: "Oh my this is a.... terrible news. Koo Hara found dead - she was one of the closest friends of Sulli, who have also passed away recently."</p>
      <p>Goo made her solo debut in 2015 with the EP Alohara (Can You Feel It?) after the break-up of <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3031398/which-member-much-missed-k-pop-girl-group-kara-now-dating">Kara</a>, which was made up of singers Park Gyu-ri and Han Seung-yeon.</p>

      <p>It was reported she tried to take her own life back in May.</p>
      <p>Goo was also in a very public row with her ex-boyfriend Choi Jong-Bum, who she accused of blackmailing her with sex tapes the pair had made.</p>
      <p>Fans were sympathetic to the star citing the Me Too movement with their messages.</p>
      <p>In May this year, Goo, 28, was found unconscious by her manager at her home in Seoul’s Gangnam district.</p>
      <p>The day before, she had posted a one-word message on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account: “Goodbye".</p>
