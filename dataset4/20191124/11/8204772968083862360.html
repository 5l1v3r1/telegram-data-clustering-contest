      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Steve+Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> is confident his <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Newcastle">Newcastle</a> side can cope with the loss of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ciaran+Clark">Ciaran Clark</a> should the defender fail to recover from a knock in time to face <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Aston+Villa">Aston Villa</a>.</p>
      <p>Republic of Ireland centre-back Clark suffered an injury while on international duty, and despite skipper <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jamaal+Lascelles">Jamaal Lascelles</a> also being sidelined until the new year with a fractured tibia, Magpies boss Bruce believes he has enough options at his disposal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Florian+Lejeune">Florian Lejeune</a> is in line to return on Monday night having been out of action since April with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Dummett">Paul Dummett</a> is in contention having featured on the bench in each of the last four matches, while <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Fabian+Schar">Fabian Schar</a> has overcome a knee problem.</p>
      <p>Bruce said of the situation: “The big one is obviously Flo, because he’s been out for so long. But he’s done everything — he’s played, he’s got minutes under his belt on the training ground and he’s ready to go.</p>
      <p>“The same goes for Schar; as long as they come through the next two or three days unscathed then they’ll both come into contention, and that can only be a good thing.</p>
      <p>“There comes a point where you can’t keep training and training and training; you have to be thrown into the deep end, if that’s the right word.</p>
      <p>“But (Lejeune) is a wonderful pro. He’s the first in, the last to go and he’s done everything he possibly can. He feels he’s ready, and I think that’s the most important thing — he knows his knee better than anybody. He’s done all his minutes and he’s ready to go.</p>
      <p>“If there’s anywhere on the pitch we’re blessed, (it’s in central defence); we’ve got six of them who are very, very decent at what they do. Touch wood, whatever combination we have put together have done OK.</p>
      <p>“The competition there is very, very healthy and good, which is a good thing. We’re losing one — possibly two — but we’re fortunate because we can bring another two in, so it’s not a bad situation.”</p>
