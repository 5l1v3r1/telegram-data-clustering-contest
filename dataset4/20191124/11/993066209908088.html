      <p>Chris Martin has said he will probably vote for the Liberal Democrats at the General Election.</p>
      <p>The Coldplay star mostly lives in Malibu in California, near to his children Apple and Moses, but he said he still votes in the UK.</p>
      <p>He joked that he would back the “Monster Raving Loonies”, before clarifying to Sunday Times’ Culture magazine: “I will probably vote Liberal Democrat.”</p>
      <blockquote>So much of what I think about life sounds weird when I say it out loud. But I’m OK singing it<cite>Chris Martin</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The music star, 42, also said that he was nervous about the band’s new album Everyday Life because it includes a number of political songs, which he feared may come across “a bit” corny.</p>
      <p>He said: “When you reach a point and realise, ‘Wow, we are really one big tribe on Earth, and here’s what I think about that’, some people may still see you as just a white man from Devon.</p>
      <p>“And say, ‘F*** off.’”</p>
      <p>He added: “Because right now there is so much isolationism, and I don’t believe in that, at all.</p>
      <p>“In fact, I want to love everyone, yet so much of what I think about life sounds weird when I say it out loud. But I’m OK singing it.”</p>
      <p>On his fears of coming across as corny, he said: “You know what, this is making me worry.</p>
      <p>“And the whole attitude of the band now is to say, ‘F*** it — just do it.’ Which is very freeing, as long as you don’t read YouTube comments.”</p>
      <p>Martin said that he believes “all the weirdness at the moment is a reaction against the freedom of expression that has happened”.</p>
      <p>He said: “No one is wrong. It is just a question of when people engage. Like with climate crisis.”</p>

      <p>Everyday Live, a double album, is Coldplay’s eighth studio album and features songs inspired by news reports about an Afghan gardener and a Nigerian hymn composer.</p>
      <p>However, unlike with their previous releases, they will not launch a globe-trotting tour because of environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>The band are in Jordan to perform two shows which will be streamed live on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Martin told BBC News earlier this week: “We’re taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial.”</p>
      <p>He said of any future tour: “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point.</p>
      <p>“How do we turn it around so it’s no so much taking as giving?”</p>
      <p>The band’s last big tour was for A Head Full Of Dreams, in 2016 and 2017.</p>
