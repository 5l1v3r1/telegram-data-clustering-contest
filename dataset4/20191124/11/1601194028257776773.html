      <p>The All India Football Federation (AIFF) Disciplinary Committee, on Sunday, declared that three players - two from FC Goa and one from NorthEast United - would serve suspensions for two games, after being involved in an ugly, late brawl on the field.</p>
      <p>Seiminlen Doungel, who was sent off after the brawl, has been suspended for two more games, after having already missed Goa's 4-2 win over Mumbai City FC. His teammate Hugo Boumous will also miss the Gaurs' next two matches, against Jamshedpur FC at home and Kerala Blasters away.</p>
      <p>Both Doungel and Boumous will be available for Sergio Lobera only when the Gaurs face Hyderabad FC in an away clash on the 8th of December.</p>
      <p>For NorthEast United, centre-back Kai Heerings has been suspended, also for two games, like Boumous, for his part in the brawl. The Dutchman will now miss the Highlanders' home clash against Mumbai City FC and their trip to Jamshedpur. He will be available for Robert Jarni when ATK visit Guwahati on the 7th of December.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred late in the game during NorthEast's 2-2 draw against Goa. The hosts were up 2-1, and Doungel took exception to a challenge made on him, which led to the mass brawl. Manvir Singh eventually scored an injury-time header to rescue a point for the ten-man Gaurs.</p>
