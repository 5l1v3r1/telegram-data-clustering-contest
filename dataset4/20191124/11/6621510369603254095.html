      <p>LAHORE – Actor and social media experimenter Ali Rehman Khan took to Twitter on Saturday to share the great news, conclusively revealing that he’s a douchebag.</p>
      <p>In a video message, the actor who was seen misbehaving with an employee at a fast food restaurant, confirmed ‘his side of the story’ on the social media platform sharing ‘what happened there’.</p>
      <p>“People around me have been calling me a classist douchebag for a long time, so we just wanted to find out whether it was true. Turns out it was,” said the Parchi actor.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to let you guys know that this was a social experiment, the aim was to raise awareness on me being a douchebag – because I am not the only one, there are others like me with inflated egos who need to be taught a lesson,” he added.</p>
      <p>Ali Rehman Khan confirmed that the initial idea was to launch a movement against the #TumJaanteHoMaiKonHun culture.</p>
      <p>“But unfortunately most of the people actually had no idea who I was, so the whole ‘tum jaante ho mai kon hun’ wasn’t workable – not with me at least,” the actor said.</p>
      <p>In a follow up tweet Ali Rehman Khan further confirmed that the experiment on whether or not he’s a douchebag has now become a self-discovery movement, which will lead him to further finding out whether he’s a liar, hypocrite, among other things.</p>
      <p>“The first video confirmed I’m a douchebag. The coming videos will reveal whether I am someone who owns and fixes that or someone who uses marketing ploys to shroud it. Stay tuned to this space as you will soon get to see the complete picture #ComingSoon #WaitForIt #BigNews,” he added.</p>
