      <p>The former Shrewsbury captain popped up with a 86th minute winner at Montgomery Waters Meadow to cap a memorable afternoon for the visitors, who survived a spirited Town fightback in the 4-3 thriller.</p>
      <p>Ogogo's reception was largely greeted positively by Town fans after three years of service between 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>"I knew I didn't have too much time. It was set perfectly, I didn't have to take a touch and used the defender's body to bend it around him," Ogogo said.</p>
      <p>"I can't explain that feeling. I wanted to celebrate and go wild but obviously I was here for three years so I didn't out of respect, but it was so hard not to.</p>
      <p>"It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. When I score I love to celebrate and go wild.</p>
      <p>"To get a last minute winner â€“ in any other game I'd have stripped off and gone in with the fans but I couldn't, it was really hard to keep my emotions in check."</p>
      <p>Ogogo admitted that the spirit shown by the side belonging to another former Shrewsbury captain, Graham Coughlan, reminded him of the Town's play-off final campaign under Paul Hurst two seasons ago.</p>
      <p>The all-action midfielder was injured towards the end of that season and unable to start either of Town's Wembley finals.</p>
      <p>"It's similar here to the season I had under Paul Hurst (at Shrewsbury) to get to the play-off final and the Cup final," the midfielder, who left Town for Coventry before joining the Memorial Stadium side, added.</p>
      <p>"Similar things are happening this season as to what happened that season so hopefully we can do the same."</p>
