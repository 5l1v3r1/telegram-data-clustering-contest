      <p><a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259013/lil-reese-says-hell-do-vladtv-interview-for-1-million-vlad-responds">Lil Reese recently spoke on the possibility of DJ Vlad reaching out to him for an interview</a>, and said: “Tell him I need a million for this story this s**t ain’t fake or free s**t bigger [than] 50 Rick Ross and whoever [else].” Vlad responded by saying, “Very happy that you survived that shooting. But nobody’s going to pay you even 1% of $1 million for that interview.”</p>
      <p>Since then, Adam 22 of No Jumper spoke on the topic of Lil Reese requesting $1 million for an interview and sided with Vlad on the matter, noting he wouldn’t pay the 1% either which amounts to $10,000. Watch above.</p>
