      <h1>Jason Derulo Denies Photoshopping His ‘Anaconda’ After Instagram Overshare</h1>

        <b>Saddle up, ladies and gentlemen: Jason Derulo’s ‘anaconda’ is 100% kosher. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The<i> Whatcha Say</i> pop star racked up the likes on Instagram on Friday, November 22, after posting an <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/celebrity/jason-derulo-says-hes-got-an-anaconda-in-his-pants/">underwear pic</a> to his followers.</p>
      <p>However, it wasn’t the singer’s smouldering gaze that was getting the attention. To be perfectly frank, it was his gargantuan knob – and it isn’t photoshopped.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Don’t worry, you don’t need to go searching on social media – here it is:</b>

      <p>The raunchy snap has went down a treat with his fans: so far, it’s sitting on 422,228 likes, and the comments are a thirsty sight to behold.</p>
      <p>One user commented: ‘All those inches, your new name is Jason DeRULER,’ while another wrote: ‘I think you have a huge Diet Coke bottle inside those boxers.’</p>
      <p>Others were more interested in what Derulo is ‘hiding in there’, with one user adding: ‘It’s fighting to get out.’</p>

      <p>Of course, humble as ever, the superstar replied with simply: ‘Anaconda.’ Joke’s on you, Derulo – anacondas generally grow up to around 15ft.</p>
      <p>However, he’s clearly enjoying the attention the post is getting. He even added a later comment: ‘Don’t lie… did you zoom?’</p>
      <p>There’s always going to be sceptics and naysayers – but Derulo has confirmed that the snap is all real, with no enhancements in sight.</p>

        <b>Commenting on the reaction to the picture, Derulo told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/jason-derulo-huge-bulge-anaconda-instagram-no-photoshop/"><i>TMZ</i></a></b>
        <b>:</b>

      <blockquote>It was in Bali. I honestly [didn’t] feel like that was going to be my most liked picture when I woke up this morning. I posted the motherf*cker very early. It was [a photo] from months ago. It was not even something that I just did.<br/><br/>Photoshop? Photoshop? Don’t make me [pull it out]. There are not enough women in this area. Just know that us Haitians, we look different.</blockquote>
      <p>There you have it. Stop the clocks, sound the alarms – Derulo’s dong is real, so we can all relax.</p>
