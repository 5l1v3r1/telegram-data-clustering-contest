      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/zoe-ball-splits-boyfriend-michael-reed-nearly-two-years-amid-claims-became-clingy-11180336/">Zoe has recently split from her boyfriend Michael Reed</a> after nearly two years together, according to reports.</p>
      <p>It marked the first public relationship the It Takes Two presenter had since the tragic suicide of her boyfriend Billy Yates in 2017.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Zoe called time on the romance with construction boss Michael amid claims she was ‘growing uncomfortable’ with reports he was using her fame for his own benefit.</p>
      <p>‘Zoe knew deep down the relationship wasn’t going anywhere,’ a friend told The Sun. ‘She enjoyed her time with Michael but came to the conclusion he wasn’t a keeper, despite him believing they were getting serious.</p>
      <p>‘There were certain things she grew uncomfortable with, such as him wanting to become a model and act. Her close circle feared he was using her to enhance his own career.’</p>
