      <h1>Record turnout as Hong Kong elections take on symbolic importance</h1>

        <b>There has been a record turnout for elections that have taken on symbolic importance in Hong Kong following months of protest.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over 40% of the district’s 4.1 million registered voters had turned out to vote by 2:30pm (6:30am Irish Time).</p>
      <p>That is more than the total number of votes cast in 2015 elections – with eight hours still to go.</p>
      <p>They are voting for council positions that are largely advisory and hold little power; however the poll is seen by many as a barometer of support for pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>There 452 seats in the city's 18 district councils up for grabs with a swing towards opposition parties expected to increase the pressure on Beijing.</p>
      <p>Demonstrations have been scaled back in recent days – with protesters anxious to ensure the vote went ahead amid Chinese government threats to call it off.</p>

      <p>Casting her vote the Beijing-backed city leader Carrie Lam expressed hope the relative calm of recent days would continue.</p>
      <p>She promised to listen “more intensively” to the views of district councils.</p>
      <p>“I hope this kind of stability and calm is not only for today's election, but to show that everyone does not want Hong Kong to fall into a chaotic situation again, hoping to get out of this dilemma, and let us have a fresh start,” she said.</p>
      <p>A number of young pro-democracy activists are running in seats that were once dominated by pro-Beijing candidates.</p>
      <p>Democratic candidate Chris Chan said the election would reflect public opinion following the upheaval of recent months.</p>

      <p>The protests erupted over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial.</p>
      <p>They then expanded into wider calls for democratic suffrage and the protection of freedoms promised to the district after it was handed back by the British in 1997.</p>
      <p>China has insisted it is not attempting to curtail those freedoms and is claiming that it remains committed to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula.</p>
