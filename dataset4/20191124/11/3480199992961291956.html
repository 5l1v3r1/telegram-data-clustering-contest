      <p>The alert has been put in place at the Tern and Perry Catchments near Shawbury.</p>
      <p>The Flood Information Service said: "River levels are high but steady at the Tern - Walcot river gauge as a result of recent rainfall in an already saturated catchment.</p>
      <p>"Consequently, flooding of roads and farmland continues. Flooding may affect low lying land and roads adjacent to the river from Wolverley to Newport.</p>
      <p>"Other locations that may be affected include Market Drayton, Wem and Rodington.</p>
      <p>"Further rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours. We expect river levels to remain high over the next few days. We are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p>"Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded."</p>
      <p>There are no flood warnings or alerts for anywhere else in Shropshire, with the county expected to avoid the brunt of the latest flood problems.</p>
      <p>Most of the warnings and severe warnings are in the north-east and the south of England but people have still been warned to take care.</p>
      <p>Alveley Community First Responders were out at calls last night and warned of persistent rain and flooding.</p>

      <p>It has said tonight will be: "A largely cloudy but mild night with a few spots of rain around. More frequent outbreaks of rain will spread from the south towards dawn. Minimum temperature 6 °C."</p>
