      <p>As soon as the attack came to light, personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and police teams rushed to the spot following which Naxals escaped into the dense forest, PTI quoted a police official as saying.</p>
      <p>“The machines were deployed in the construction of the facility’s screening plant number 3. Combing operation is underway to nab the Naxals involved in the arson,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, this is not the first time that Maoists have attacked NMDC’s facilities in Dantewada to disrupt its mining operations.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in a separate incident, three Naxals were arrested and two women ultras surrendered in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district, PTI quoted police as saying. The Maoists were apprehended near Timelwada village under Chintagufa police station limits by a security team on a search operation.</p>
      <p>“The three were involved in two incidents of attacks on police teams in 2017 in Chintagufa area. They have been remanded in judicial custody,” a police official said.</p>
