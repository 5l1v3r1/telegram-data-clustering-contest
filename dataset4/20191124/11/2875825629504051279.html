      <h2>Forget WagAgathaChristie - the Rooneys are closer than ever on a mini break</h2>

      <p>Wayne Rooney has whisked wife Coleen off on their first childless romantic break after the WAGatha Christie drama.</p>
      <p>The pair shared a romantic snap from their childless break without sons Kai, 10, Klay, six, Kit, three, and Cass, 21 months.</p>
      <p>It comes after a tough few months for the mum who waged war on Rebecca Vardy by accusing the star's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account of leaking fake stories about her.</p>

      <p>Coleen claimed she laid a carefully set trap where only Rebecca Vardy's Instagram could view her Instagram stories which consequently ended up being branded the WAGatha Christie drama.</p>
      <p>Wayne shared the romantic picture on Sunday from Dubai's luxiourious Mandarin Oriental Jumeira. He captioned the snap: "Nice break in Dubai with Coleen Rooney. Thanks to all the staff for looking after us."</p>

      <p>Coleen opted for a sassy scoop neck thigh skimming dress which showed off her Dubai tan to perfection.</p>
      <p>The break comes after the pairs first date night earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Captioning the date night snap Coleen wrote: "It’s been a while.... Great to be back to weekday date nights and meeting up with friends."</p>
      <p>This Christmas will mark the Rooney's first in their new £20million home so no wonder they have got the festive fever already.</p>
