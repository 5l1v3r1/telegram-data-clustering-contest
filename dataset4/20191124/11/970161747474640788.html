      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bruno-tonioli/">Bruno Tonioli</a> has thanked viewers for showing the love after he sang on the show.</p>
      <p>Bruno sang and danced the show’s opening number on Saturday night’s live show.</p>
      <p>Taking to the stage in a white tuxedo and surrounded by pink feather fans, the Strictly judge performed Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.</p>
      <p>On Twitter the 63-year-old sent a message of thanks to viewers for all their positive comments.</p>
      <p>Admitting he was ‘nervous’ about performing, he tweeted: ‘Thank you all so much for your kind comments on my singing!! I was so nervous, I’ve been practising so much as well as having singing lessons… something different and certainly took me outside my comfort zone.’</p>
      <p>He was congratulated by the show’s band, who tweeted him: ‘You did brilliantly Bruno’.</p>
      <p>Viewers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/strictlys-bruno-tonioli-sings-opening-dance-twitter-goes-meltdown-11207564/">were loving the ‘camp’ performance</a> and some called for him to do it every week.</p>

      <p>We wonder if any other judges are going to follow suit? Craig Revel-Horwood we’d love to see, and we reckon Motsi Mabuse can put on a show.</p>

      <p>Bruno <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/bruno-tonioli-sad-strictly-come-dancing-sex-routine-draws-nearly-200-complaints-11197645/">recently defended the show’s same sex routine</a> between dancers Johannes Radebe and Graziano di Prima.</p>
      <p>The two men performed to Shine by Emeli Sande during a recent results show, which racked up nearly 200 complaints from viewers.</p>
      <p>Describing the news as ‘very sad’, he tweeted: ‘It’s hard to believe after such progress in society and many other topics going on that over 200 people felt so upset they complained when 2 men danced with each other… I just don’t know what to say… Very sad. #bbcstrictly.’</p>
      <p>Saturday was an emotional night for contestant Karim Zeroual, who broke down in tears after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/strictlys-karim-zeroual-holds-back-tears-dedicates-emotional-performance-mum-11207827/">dedicating his performance to his mum</a>.</p>
      <p>The star took on the couples’ choice routine with a contemporary dance to Drops Of Jupiter by Train.</p>
