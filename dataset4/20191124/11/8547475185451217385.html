      <p>Essex Police have started extradition proceedings to bring him to the UK.</p>
      <p>Brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes, also from Northern Ireland, are currently wanted by police on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>Two men, aged 38 and 46, and a woman, 38, have all been released on bail pending further enquiries until 24 January.</p>
      <p>A number of others have also been arrested in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The lorry was discovered in the early hours of 23 October, and sparked the "largest mass fatality victim identification" investigation in the history of Essex Police.</p>
