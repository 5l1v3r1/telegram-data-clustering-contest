      <h1>Newcastle United Sunday gossip: Owen and Shearer could appear on TV together; Jarrod Bowen latest</h1>
      <h2>A round-up of the latest Newcastle United headlines as Michael Owen, Alan Shearer, Jarrod Bowen and Rafa Benitez all feature</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:21:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Former Newcastle United strikers Alan Shearer and Michael Owen could end up in the same television studio just months after their infamous Twitter spat.</p>
      <p>That is according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/michael-owen-alan-shearer-set-20946290">the Mirror,</a> who claim the pair could go head-to-head during Amazon Prime's Boxing Day Premier League coverage, after they were both confirmed to be part of their extensive talent line-up.</p>
      <p>Amazon Prime are broadcasting 20 Premier League games across December, including the full Boxing Day round of fixtures, and the report claims they are trying to line up the duo to be studio pundits for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle's</a> trip to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The pair fell out when <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alan-shearer">Shearer</a> accused <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/michael-owen">Owen</a> of being reluctant to play for Newcastle in their relegation decided against Aston Villa in 2009, while Big Al was Magpies boss.</p>
      <p>Owen hit back in his recent autobiography, claiming Shearer was trying to deflect blame for Newcastle's relegation and it led to a very public dispute on Twitter earlier this year.</p>
      <p>After linking to a video of Owen explaining to BT Sport how much he hated his time at Newcastle and wanted to retire, Shearer wrote on Twitter: "Yes Michael, we thought that also, whilst on £120k a week....."</p>
      <p>Owen responded: "Not sure you are as loyal to Newcastle and you make out mate. I distinctly remember you being inches away from signing for Liverpool after Sir Bobby Robson put you on the bench. You tried everything to get out."</p>
      <p>Amazon bosses know 'sparks could fly' according to the report, but believe it could be 'compulsive viewing' as they look to make an impact on their Premier League broadcasting debut.</p>
      <p>An Amazon insider told the Mirror: “It would be great to have both of them in the studio but we would settle for one being in the studio and the other one alongside the match commentator.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/transfer-news/newcastle-target-january-transfer-swoop-20944744">the Daily Star</a> claim Newcastle boss <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> could wait until the summer to pursue a move for Hull City star Jarrod Bowen.</p>
      <p>The Magpies' interest in the free-scoring winger has been well documented and the 22-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Hull have an option to extend his contract by another year, though, and although the report claims Bruce could test the Tigers' resolve with a January bid for the 10-goal star, he is 'prepared to hang fire' until the summer to make his move.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, former Newcastle manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez</a> has given an extensive interview to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7718513/Rafa-Benitez-opens-new-life-luxury-billionaire-Chinese-Super-League.html">Mail Online</a> about his new life in China as manager of Dalian Yifang.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard joined the Chinese Super League outfit just days after his contract as Newcastle manager expired and he has delivered another killer line as to why he felt his future was better in Yifang as opposed to Tyneside.</p>
      <p>He said: "Newcastle was another challenge. A massive club, a fanbase supporting the team, a whole city. But after a few months you could see it was a different vision. The takeover was not coming and we needed to think about other options.</p>
      <p>"This was the same idea, a chance to build something, a challenge. It was big project versus no project. The decision was easy."</p>
