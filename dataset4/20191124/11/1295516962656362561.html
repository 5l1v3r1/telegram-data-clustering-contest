      <p>Since acquiring the publishing license to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/he-man-and-the-masters-of-the-universe/"><i>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</i></a>, DC Comics has consistently put out solid stories expanding the iconic animated character's adventures, including memorable crossovers with the heroes of the DC Universe and the Thundercats. The latest He-Man miniseries is a crossover of sorts with itself, as alternate incarnations of the fantasy world of Eternia and its classic champions and villains come together for an epic miniseries <i>He-Man and the Masters of the Multiverse</i> by Tim Seeley and Dan Fraga.</p>
      <p>The new miniseries has a fiendish, villainous vision of Prince Adam aptly named Anti-He-Man from Anti-Eternia traveling to different Eternias across the Multiverse to kill each respective version of their champions and steal the Power of Greyskull to significantly boost his power. As the villain steadily grows stronger, a group of unlikely He-Men travel the Multiverse themselves to form an impromptu, desperate team to save the various Eternias from their evil counterpart before he grows truly unstoppable.</p>

      <p>Seeley has previously worked with He-Man to great effect, last year's crossover between the Masters of the Universe and DC's Injustice Universe. Here, he's going full tilt on a love letter to the entire history of the classic 80s, animated hero and the various eras across his multiple media adaptations over the past three decades. This is clear from the outset, as Seeley presents an opening that both subverts reader expectation and clearly establishes the threat presented by Anti-He-Man before expanding the scope to match the miniseries' ambitious premise.</p>
      <p>The very nature of the story rewards and enriches the experience for longtime fans of the character, especially for those particularly savvy on his history, but Seeley also crafts an opening issue that welcomes new readers and those not as well-versed on the property to the proceedings. This is done through the inspired choice of selecting Prince Keldor, the champion perhaps destined to become the dreaded Skeletor, as the main P.O.V. character for the issue; Eternia's greatest scourge potentially becoming the multiverse's best chance for survival against this fearsome, new threat. Of course, plenty of unexpected and fan-favorite characters make surprise appearances over the course of the issue with the promise of even wackier moments to come; Seeley is clearly having a lot of fun assembling his cast to capitalize on the potential of the premise and that fun is fortunately infectious.</p>

      <p>That sense of fun and clear love of the material extends to the art team as well, with penciler Dan Fraga joined by inker Richard Friend and colorist Matt Yackey. The visuals are a full-on celebration of the history of He-Man, with the issue's opening sequence a direct nod to the original animated incarnation of the Masters of the Universe that first catapulted the property into the mainstream. However, as different incarnations of He-Man enter the fray, the art team wisely retains the significant differences in visual styles, living up to the possibilities of bringing this eclectic team of He-Men together for an appropriately epic quest.</p>
      <p><i>He-Man and the Masters of the Multiverse</i> is off to a strong start, with Tim Seeley and Dan Fraga clearly having a blast as they stage every era of the Master of the Universe in a jam session worthy of their combined might. Both a love letter to the animated franchise's entire history while forging an adventure for new readers and longtime fans of the property alike. Taking the premise to wacky, surprising places without compromising the stakes, the opening issue proves that the comic future for He-Man remains bright for any iteration of the character.</p>
