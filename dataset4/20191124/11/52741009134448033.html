      <p>GOMA, Congo — A plane carrying at least 17 passengers crashed Sunday on takeoff in Congo’s eastern city of Goma, killing those on board, officials said, and possibly people on the ground.</p>
      <p>The aircraft crashed into residential homes near Goma’s airport in the North Kivu province.</p>
      <p>"The governor of North Kivu is sad to announce the plane crash this morning at Goma International Airport. The first information in our possession indicates that the plane had 17 passengers on board before failing to take off,” a statement from North Kivu governor Nzanzu Kasivita Carly’s office said. It did not give a casualty toll.</p>
      <p>The aircraft was owned by private carrier Busy Bee and was headed to Beni, about 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma in the same province.</p>
      <p>Air accidents are frequent in Congo, given poor maintenance and relaxed air safety standards.</p>
