      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ChrisMartin">Chris Martin</a> resorted to typing out his answers in a Text to Speech app during an interview after losing his voice from singing too much.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Coldplay">Coldplay</a> frontman typed his words onto an iPad keyboard, and his answers were then read out in a robotic British voice known as Arthur.</p>
      <p>In the interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chris-martin-coldplay-interview-singer-everyday-life-new-album-god-is-the-answer-children-apple-moses-hxzp8h625"><i>The Sunday Times</i></a>, Martin was the victim of numerous self-inflicted typos, including writing “calamity crisis” instead of “climate crisis” and calling Nick Cave a “brilliant Julie” rather than a “brilliant junkie”.</p>
      <p>Part of the interview took place in the back of a car, as Martin had to leave early to go to Harley Street for an appointment about his throat.</p>
      <p>Martin sat with a keyboard on his lap and the iPad on the seat between him an interviewer Jonathan Dean. “Mark is a great driver,” he typed, about his chauffeur. “Mark hates me.”</p>
      <p>Coldplay’s new album, <i>Everyday Life</i>, was released on Friday 22 November and was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/coldplay-everyday-life-review-album-gun-control-syria-chris-martin-a9211046.html">given three stars</a> by <i>The Independent</i>’s critic Adam White.</p>
      <p>The band recently <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/coldplay-new-album-chris-martin-environment-everyday-life-world-tour-tickets-show-a9211731.html">made headlines</a> for saying they would not tour the world with their new record unless concerts are environmentally friendly.</p>
