      <h1>Why do travellers set up camp in Southport so frequently?</h1>
      <h2>"It's the same every couple of weeks, and it will continue because nobody ever does anything about [travellers' camps]"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/kate-lally/" target="_blank">Kate Lally</a></address>
      <p>Another unauthorised travellers camp in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> has prompted local residents to ask why their town is so popular among members of the travelling community.</p>
      <p>A convoy of caravans appeared on a car park on land in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ainsdale">Ainsdale</a> this weekend, before moving to the Esplanade - and it's the not the first time such a camp has set up at the resort town.</p>
      <p>In both June and October of this year, groups of travellers pitched up <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/travellers-set-up-park-camp-17128190">at Tulketh Street car park</a> - just days after a group of seven caravans and associated vehicles parked up at the derelict Park and Ride site in Kew without a permit.</p>

      <p>And figures obtained from a Freedom Of Information request showed travellers are indeed setting up camp more in Sefton than any other Merseyside borough.</p>
      <p>Since 2016, 70 illegal traveller camps have been reported to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> - that's almost 1.5 per month.</p>
      <p>In Liverpool, over the same time period, 40 camps were reported.</p>
      <p>And a number of people living in Southport say they are 'fed up' of such camps in their local area.</p>
      <p>Meryl Hesketh said: "The law needs changing with regard to travellers breaking the law in this way! It's happening so often now in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> ."</p>

      <p>Matt Thomas added: "Becoming all too often, this."</p>
      <p>Sooey Jaygee said: "We have the same story and comments every couple of weeks, and it will continue nobody ever does anything to stop [travellers camping illegally]."</p>
      <p>Jim Brown implored Sefton Council to "do more" to stop such camps.</p>
      <p>But the local authority says it does everything in its power to manage unauthorised encampments "in a way that supports both the needs of the Gypsies and Travellers and the rights of the settled community".</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> said: “We provide a permanent site, based in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/formby">Formby</a> , which is open to Gypsies and Travellers who wish to stay in Sefton on a long-term basis.</p>
      <p>"Although a transit site is allocated on the Local Plan, at the moment there is no transit site for those moving through the borough seeking a short stay.</p>
      <p>“We have an Unauthorised Encampment Policy in place to manage any unauthorised encampments in a way that addresses both the support needs of the Gypsies and Travellers and the rights of the settled community.</p>
      <p>“Once we aware of an unauthorised encampment our housing standards team undertake the necessary welfare checks. If there are no welfare issues we can then begin the necessary legal process to deal with unauthorised encampments as quickly as possible within the timescales set out in government legislation.</p>
      <p>“In cases where there have been a number of previous encampments, we have been able to put preventative measures in place.”</p>
      <p>Of the 16 traveller camps reported in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a> this year so far, 12 have been in Southport.</p>
      <p>Win Lawlor, Deputy Director of Irish Community Care Merseyside (ICCM), acts as the Strategic Business Lead for Irish Travellers and Gypsies for ICC, a charity which responds to the needs of Irish and Irish Traveller communities.</p>
      <p>She has previously urged people not to make “knee jerk reactions” against travellers based on fear and what they have seen in the media, and said that Romany Gypsy Travellers are an ethnic group of people who should be treated with equality as any other minority group would.</p>
      <p>She said at the time: “If you have one bad experience with a traveller it’s not fair to lump them all together and it’s not legal either. They are an ethnic minority group, and local authorities have to look at the living needs for all."</p>
