      <p>The Glamour Boys face Maritzburg United this afternoon as they chase a place in the Telkom Knockout final, and while Middendorp did say earlier in the week that Bruce Bvuma would start, some supporters were still holding out hope after Chiefs confirmed that their number one was ‘medically fit’.</p>
      <p>Now though, the German has revealed that Khune didn’t even travel with the squad to Nelspruit though, with Bvuma due to start and the recently re-signed Brylon Petersen to make his first matchdays squad for the first time since re-signing.</p>
      <p>The club said on their official website today that ‘even though Itumeleng Khune’s groin injury has healed, the goalkeeper didn’t make the trip to Mbombela’, with Middendorp explaining that ‘now we’re busy getting him to be match ready’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, regarding Kearyn Baccus – who will return today – he said, “Kearyn Baccus recovered a two weeks ago. We’ve been working on him to be match fit and now is available for selection.”</p>
