      <h1>Five talking points from Preston North End's defeat to Derby County at Pride Park</h1>

        <b>After three wins on the spin and four games unbeaten, Preston found the going tough at Derby and lost 1-0 at Pride Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Poor in the first half and a bit better in the second would be fair assessment of the pattern of North End’s play in the East Midlands.</p>

      <p>Here are some of the talking points from the game.</p>
      <p>
        <i>1. The Lilywhites are still looking to find their feet away from home. This was a fourth defeat on their travels and in three of them they have failed to score.</i>
      </p>
      <p>In the first half, they failed to impose themselves on the game with Derby very much in the ascendancy.</p>
      <p>North End were better in the second half, the Rams allowing them to have more of the ball and attempting to counter.</p>

        <figcaption>Preston right-back Darnell Fisher jumps for a header against Duane Holmes</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But a lot of the play was in front of the Derby defence rather than getting in behind and clear-cut chances were few and far between.</p>
      <p>
        <i>2. Darnell Fisher had put in some strong displays of late but Saturday’s was not one of them.</i>
      </p>
      <p>That is not singling him out for criticism, with some of his colleagues off-key too.</p>
      <p>However, with North End playing a high defensive line, Derby found plenty of space behind right-back Fisher.</p>
      <p>The yellow card he got for a foul on Mason Bennett was his ninth of the season in just 15 appearances.</p>
      <p>Having already served a one-game ban for five bookings, a two-match suspension is just a caution away.</p>
      <p>That is a worry with Joe Rafferty operating at left-back to good effect – Andrew Hughes remains sidelined, as does Tom Clarke.</p>
      <p>Alan Browne is an option to play right-back, as he did in the second half after Fisher was subbed at the interval.</p>
      <p>
        <i>3. North End goalkeeper Declan Rudd has sometimes has the finger pointed at him this season but he deserved the plaudits on Saturday for a decent performance.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Twice he came out on top in one-on-one situations in the first half to deny Tom Lawrence and Martyn Waghorn.</p>
      <p>Rudd did so again after the break to deny Waghorn, although that one was a more comfortable save.</p>
      <p>
        <i>4. Alex Neil hasn’t been afraid to change things early, for example bringing Jayden Stockley off the bench in the first half against Blackburn last month.</i>
      </p>
      <p>At Derby, he made a double change at half-time, introducing Paul Gallagher and Billy Bodin.</p>
      <p>Gallagher was Preston’s best player in the second half, displaying a calmness on the ball and a good range of passing.</p>
      <p>He could probably count himself unfortunate not to start after a good display in the win against Huddersfield before the break.</p>
      <p>It was nice to see Bodin on the pitch, this the winger’s first appearance since September 14.</p>
      <p>The third substitute used was Jordan Storey, that a change forced on Neil by an injury to Ben Davies.</p>
      <p>Storey looked very measured in his time on the pitch, playing next to Patrick Bauer for the first time in a competitive game.</p>
      <p>After being a regular pick in the second half of last season, this was only Storey's appearance in a Championship game this campaign - the other was as a substitute too.</p>
      <p>Bringing Storey on unfortunately denied David Nugent a run-out against the club he left in the summer after a two-and-a-half year stay.</p>
      <p>Nugent was ready to come on when Davies was injured, hence Storey getting the nod instead.</p>
      <p>
        <i>5. Although the team didn't fire on the day, the North End supporters certainly did.</i>
      </p>
      <p>There were 2,435 of them at Derby, packed into one corner of the ground. They made plenty of noise, were in good voice but unfortunately didn't get a goal to celebrate.</p>
      <p>Pride Park is a decent ground with good acoustics but I'm no fan of its location. If you can imagine plonking Deepdale in the middle of a bigger version of Deepdale Retail Park, then that should give you an idea of what the Rams' home is like.</p>
