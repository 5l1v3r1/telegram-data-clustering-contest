      <h1>Unseen photos that show Wirral as you've never seen it before</h1>
      <h2>Photos from the 1930s right up to the 1990s show Wirral in a different light</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:49:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lorna-hughes/" target="_blank">Lorna Hughes</a></address>
      <p>Fascinating images from our archives reveal <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a> as you've never seen it before - from the way we used to travel to sunny days beside the seaside for the Wirral Show.</p>
      <p>We've delved into <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO's</a> archives for these photos from the 1930s right up to the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Over the years our photographers have snapped everything from the summer days that saw holidaymakers flocking to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/new-brighton">New Brighton</a> to the changing fortunes of our town centres and incredible aerial views giving a glimpse of how our streets used to look.</p>

      <p>We were also granted access to some of Wirral's most famous work places, including Squibbs, Cadbury's in Moreton and Birkenhead's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cammell-laird">Cammell Laird.</a></p>
      <p>One photo from March 1949 shows Wirral’s Remploy site, part of a network of factories set up after World War II to provide sheltered employment for disabled people.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Liverpool ECHO</a> story accompanying it read: “A corner of the bright workroom where disabled men are taught to work with the leather.</p>
      <p>"On the left is a cutting out punch, centre a woman instructor is seen giving guidance at the sewing machine, and right others are having instruction in hand cutting of the leather.”</p>
      <p>Sadly the factory, which specialised in textile production, shut in 2012 as part of a raft of closures after the government announced it was cutting its funding.</p>
      <p>Other archive images show radical changes for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead town centre</a> in the 1960s with the construction of flyovers to reduce congestion caused by traffic heading to the Birkenhead tunnel.</p>

      <p>Crowds took part in a walkover on July 14, 1969 - the day before the flyovers opened - while one striking photo shows how Shaftesbury Boys Club on Thomas Street was cut off from the town by a flyover passing only a few feet from the front door.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/property">The ECHO</a> reported that the club intended to build a new £70,000 HQ on a 6.5 acre site off Borough Road.</p>
      <p>In the 1950s and 60s <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/new-brighton">New Brighton</a> was the place to be in the summer months, and our photos show packed beaches, the fun of donkey rides by Fort Perch Rock and the excitement of a model boat race in New Brighton in August 1954.</p>
      <p>And they show the sad end for New Brighton’s famous miniature railway after it was sold at auction, together with the adjoining playground, for £567.</p>

      <p>The locomotive Crompton and a 24-seat coach were bought for £400 by Bill Morris, 50, of Hereford - who’s pictured, and planned to run the railway at fetes and shows.  </p>
      <p>Over in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/hoylake">Hoylake</a> , we took a photo of Hugh Williamson leading excitable youngsters gathered for the town's annual beach mission - a mix of evangelism and fun and games for children - in August 1975.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/new-brighton">New Brighton</a> Baths is Wirral's most famous open-air swimming pool but our photos also show what it was like at the nearby Derby Pool in the height of summer - and the rarely seen pool in New Ferry.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile images of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral’s</a> best known street scenes show how they've undergone a radical transformation over the years.</p>
      <p>What is now a branch of Domino's and a charity shop in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liscard">Liscard</a> was once the ABC cinema - and nearby Liscard Road was a popular, bustling shopping street.</p>
      <p>Our archive images also show a deserted Grange Road, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> on May 6, 1960, when shoppers stayed at home to watch the Royal wedding.</p>
      <p>Princess Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones at Westminster Abbey - the first Royal wedding to be broadcast on television.  </p>
