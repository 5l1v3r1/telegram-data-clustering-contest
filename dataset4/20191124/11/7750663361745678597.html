      <p>Ortiz was ahead on the judges scorecards before being caught with a thunderous right hand from Wilder in the seventh round and the 40-year-old was unable to beat the count.</p>
      <p>"I tell people all the time my intellect is very high in the ring so I know exactly what I'm doing," Wilder, 34, told Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>"I had to calculate Ortiz perfectly, he's very dangerous in that ring as you can see, that's why no other heavyweight wanted to give him the opportunity. He's very smart</p>
      <p>"Once I got him I set him up and that was the shot. I always say these guys have to be perfect for 12 rounds, I only have to be perfect for two seconds and each and every time I've proved that.</p>
      <p>"Tyson Fury is definitely next and then after that I want a unification bout with whoever wins between (Anthony) Joshua and (Andy) Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>"Right now we're ready for Tyson Fury. Hopefully he's ready for me, I know his trainer's here so I hope he got some notes down.Â I'm ready to go at any give time and any given moment and February is looking like our time."</p>
