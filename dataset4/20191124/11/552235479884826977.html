      <h1>The unseen Celtic benefit as Chris Sutton delivers Scott Brown Scotland return verdict</h1>
      <h2>The pundit feels that Brown's time has come and gone as a Scotland player.</h2>

      <p>Former Celtic star Chris Sutton has poured cold water on claims <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> could return as a Scotland player.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead captain has already retired twice from Scotland duty but comments made at an event this week suggested the door hasn't completely closed on his international career.</p>
      <p>Brown said: “They still have two games to get through but....you never say never.</p>
      <p>“It would be phenomenal to get to a finals after 22 years. I remember watching the games at France '98 as a 13-year-old and my mum put <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> flags all around the windows and outside in the street.</p>
      <p>“It was great and it shows you the whole country wants us to get back there again. The Tartan Army are great supporters, whether it’s at home or abroad and it would be good for them as well."</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chris-sutton">Sutton</a> was quick to dismiss the idea, suggesting that such a move would benefit neither party.</p>
      <p>He believes Brown's downtime over the international break is a key factor in his continued good domestic form.</p>

      <p>Speaking on BT Sport, he said: "No I think that ship has sailed. He's been in great form this season but that's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> 's strength though in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>"I don't think that would necessarily benefit him. He has been phenomenal this season and the fact that he has had the rest.</p>
      <p>"I don't think that would benefit either party but maybe it will sell a few DVDs."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ally-mccoist">Ally McCoist</a> was in sync with his punditry colleague, emphasising how the rest during international breaks has benifited his physical condition.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm in agreement with Chris. I don't think it's a good idea to be honest with you. The lads (who have got us to this stage) deserve an opportunity.</p>
      <p>"He has benefited from the fact that he hasn't been involved in international football with the rest that he's been able to get and I think that should continue."</p>
