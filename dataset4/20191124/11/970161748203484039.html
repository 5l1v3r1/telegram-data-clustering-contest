      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-timberlake/">Justin Timberlake</a> has hit the headlines<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/justin-timberlake-seeing-holding-hands-co-star-ditches-wedding-ring-parties-without-wife-jessica-biel-11208805/"> after he was spotted holding hands with the co-star of his forthcoming movie Palmer earlier this week.</a></p>
      <p>The 38-year-old pop star and actor was spotted with Alisha Wainwright, who appears with him in the football drama – sparking speculation although a source told Mail Online there is ‘nothing going on’ between the two of them.</p>
      <p>Justin is of course married to actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jessica-biel/">Jessica Biel</a>, – who fell for the former NSYNC singer despite admitting she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/teenage-jessica-biel-not-huge-fan-husband-justin-timberlake-n-sync-10972568/">wasn’t a fan of the boyband</a>.</p>
      <p>But how long have they been together – and who has Justin dated in the past?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How long have Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel been married?</h3>
      <p>The two superstars started dating in January 2007.</p>
      <p>The two had a temporary break in March 2011, releasing a statement to People magazine insisting they’ll ‘remain friends and continue to hold the highest level of love and respect for each other.’</p>

      <p>You can’t clip the wings of two true love birds, though and they reconciled around June.</p>
      <p>They became engaged in December 2011 and married on October 19 2012 at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy.</p>

      <p>In 2015, the two welcomed their son Silas Randall.</p>
      <p>And perhaps their most important milestone – in 2019, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/26/jessica-biel-wins-halloween-as-she-rocks-nsync-era-justin-timberlake-costume-for-star-studded-bash-10987233/">Jessica Biel won Halloween</a>, dressing as her hubby in his NSYNC get-up.</p>

      <h4>Britney Spears</h4>
      <p>How could anyone forget <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/britney-spears/">Britney</a> and Justin?</p>
      <p>Meeting as youngsters in Disney’s Mickey Mouse Club, the two grew up together and dated from 1998 to 2002.</p>
      <p>During their tenure as America’s Sweethearts, they gave us such iconic moments as the matching denim outfit – which is still recreated by the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/31/kendall-jenner-pays-homage-to-justin-timberlake-and-britney-spears-in-double-denim-6893210/">Kendall Jenner</a>, Katy Perry, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/jake-paul-tana-mongeau-bring-sexyback-britney-spears-justin-timberlake-tribute-11002954/">Jake Paul and Tana Mongeau.</a></p>
      <p>When they first broke up, cheating rumours were banded around – with Timberlake’s own Cry Me a River adding fuel to the fire.</p>

      <p>However, the two have remained pretty amicable over the years.</p>
      <p>In a 2011 Vanity Fair interview, Justin said: ‘I wish her the best—that goes without saying. We haven’t spoken in nine or 10 years.’</p>

      <h4>Cameron Diaz</h4>
      <p>Justin dated Hollywood star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cameron-diaz/">Cameron Diaz</a> for four years, from 2003 to 2007.</p>
      <p>The two never revealed what led to their break-up, but they stayed on good terms.</p>
      <p>So much so that they’ve worked together twice since breaking up – in 2007’s Shrek the Third and in 2011’s Bad Teacher.</p>

      <p>The singer ended up as the opening act for Justin’s 2007 FutureSex/LoveShow tour.</p>
      <h4>Alyssa Milano</h4>
      <p>Charmed actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alyssa-milano/">Alyssa</a> and Justin briefly dated in 2002.</p>
      <p>This was the same year he broke up with Britney – and broke hearts the world over.</p>
      <p>Even Alyssa thought Justin and Britney were ‘the perfect match’ as she told Entertainment Tonight in 2015.</p>
