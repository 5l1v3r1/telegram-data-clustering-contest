      <h1>18 emerging Indonesian leaders invited to attend Obama Foundation Leaders forum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:50:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">Vela Andapita</a></address>
      <p>Eighteen young leaders from Indonesia have been selected to join hundreds of their peers at the Obama Foundation Leaders: Asia Pacific forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, slated to run for five days in December.</p>
      <p>The cross-sector global forum has invited around 200 emerging leaders from 33 countries from various backgrounds – be it public, private or non-profit – to represent work on a variety of issues such as education, environment, communication and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>One of the young leaders from Indonesia, Dissa Ahdanisa, is the founder of Fingertalk, a social enterprise that works with the deaf community and people with other disabilities.</p>
      <p>She said she looked forward to working with other young leaders to spread awareness about people with disabilities and the challenges they faced, particularly in Indonesia.</p>
      <p>“I would also like to meet likeminded people from different parts of the world, learn about what they do, why and how they do it, to hopefully collaborate to create a much bigger impact in the future,” she said in a release made available to <i>The Jakarta Post</i> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Echoing Dissa, the executive editor of not-for-profit media <i>The Conversation Indonesia</i>, Prodita Sabarini, said she was honored to be selected and to be a part of a diverse and amazing cohort.</p>
      <p>“Growing up, the leaders I saw were male, along with their authoritarian and dominating styles. We need more diversity in leadership positions,” she said.</p>
      <p>Bawah Anambas Foundation head Jerry Winata said most countries in the Asia-Pacific region were still considered developing and growing middle-income nations that stood in between prioritizing economic growth versus having stronger environmental protection efforts.</p>
      <p>He had spent many years in development works, lifting people out of poverty with the World Bank and improving nutrition for impoverished children and pregnant women with the United Nation’s World Food Program.</p>
      <p>“I am humbled to be part of the first class of Obama Foundation Leaders,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am extremely excited to connect with 199 other emerging leaders from across the Asia-Pacific region to illuminate a clearer path for sustainable growth,” he added.</p>
      <p>The 18 Indonesian leaders and others will convene in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Dec. 10 to 14.</p>
      <p>The event aims to equip the participants with workshops to improve their skills and provide opportunities for them to expand their global networking.</p>
      <p>It will be followed by a one-year leadership program, throughout which the participants are expected to apply the skills and knowledge they learn during the forum in their respective fields.</p>
      <p>In addition to former United States president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, other prominent figures are also scheduled to give speeches and bring up discussions about, among other topics, progress and opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
      <p>The figures include Malaysian Women, Family and Community Development Deputy Minister YB Hannah Yeoh, Malaysian entrepreneur and Air Asia cofounder Tony Fernandes as well as Indonesian entrepreneur and JAVARA founder Helianti Hilman.</p>
