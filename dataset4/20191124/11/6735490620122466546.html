      <p>Ryan Reynolds made a surprise appearance during Will Ferrell’s “Saturday Night Live” monologue this week, and delighted fans when he popped up later in the show during “Weekend Update”.</p>
      <p>Alex Moffat was reprising his smarmy “Guy Who Owns a Boat” character, and then introduced his equally obnoxious pal “Guy Who Knows the Owner,” played by Reynolds, as they offered their dubious advice on hooking up.</p>
      <p>At the end of their bit, “Weekend Update” anchor Colin Jost bid the pair farewell, calling them “my two best friends” — a line made all the more interesting given that Reynolds was once married to Scarlett Johansson, who is currently engaged to Jost.</p>
