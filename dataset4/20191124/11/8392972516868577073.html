      <p>Former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle shocked <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> viewers last night when she admitted she had used a pair of her knickers as a face cloth.</p>
      <p>The singer had left the undies on the floor of the camp and they were later found by former rugby player James Haskell.</p>
      <p>After discovering the knickers, James asked the rest of his campmates who they belonged to.</p>

      <p>Nadine eventually confessed, admitting she actually used them to wash her face.</p>
      <p>"This is my face cloth, they were my pants," she sheepishly explained before rubbing them across her face and neck.</p>
      <aside>That is grim.</aside>
      <p>"I’m not very good with lady bits," James replied.</p>
      <p>"When my mum used to take me to M&amp;S and the big bra and pants section I used to freak out, I mean, bear in mind I was only 5 or 6 years old."</p>

      <p>After watching the exchange, viewers of the ITV show flocked to social media to share their disgust.</p>
      <p>"Old knickers as a face cloth? Gross," one remarked, while another tweeted, "Nadine no no no."</p>
      <p>"That is grim," said a third.</p>
      <p>However, lots of others thought it was a rather smart move, with a fourth writing: "Love that Nadine uses pants as a face cloth."</p>
      <p>"Using your pants as a face cloth... jungle life at its peak," someone else commented.</p>
      <p>It came just a few days after she had <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celeb</a> fans in hysterics when she used a thong as a hair tie.</p>

      <p>"Thong as a bobble, knickers as a face cloth. Nadine is the multipurpose Queen. #ImACeleb #TeamNadine #imacelebrity," another tweeted.</p>
      <p>Nadine also caused a stir on Twitter when she declared she was friends with everyone in Girls Aloud.</p>
      <p>Nadine insisted the former girl group all got on and told Jacqueline Jossa that any rumours suggesting she was feuding with Cheryl Tweedy was "fake news".</p>
