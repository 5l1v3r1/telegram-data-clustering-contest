      <p>We’re one week into <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> 2019 and it’s been a belter of a series so far.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> accidentally falling out of a window, to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> and Roman’s compelling Bushtucker trial through to Jane McDonald-gate and Cliff Parisi bringing a Christmas tree into camp, we’ve been loving it so far.</p>
      <p>The show is of course on every night, and tonight’s is one of the most anticipated of the series, as it’s time for the annual live Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What time is I’m A Celebrity on tonight?</h3>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity continues on ITV on Sunday night at 9pm.</p>
      <p>Tonight you’ve got a bumper instalment of the show to accommodate the live trial – it’s on for an hour and a half ahead of the ITV News at 10.30pm.</p>

      <p>Dec confirmed the live trial was happening on Sunday’s show at the end of Saturday night’s show, right after Ian Wright and Jacqueline Jossa had been chosen for the Bushtucker Trial before the live one – a decision which reduced Jacqueline to tears.</p>

      <p>The live trial can be a pretty eventful one – being the moment which led Gillian McKeith to faint after she was chosen for the challenge back in 2010.</p>
      <h3>When is the I’m A Celebrity final?</h3>

      <p>We’ve still got a way to go on the show, as the final’s not until Sunday 8 December.</p>
      <p>Corrie actor Andrew Whyment is currently the favourite to win – despite having been a late arrival to camp along with Cliff Parisi earlier this week.</p>
      <p>‘The self-confessed super fan of the show has really struck a chord with punters and dingo dollars are coming in thick and fast for him to emerge as the winner,’ said Ladbrokes’ Jessica O’Reilly.</p>
      <p>With eliminations set to begin very soon, there really is everything to play for.</p>
