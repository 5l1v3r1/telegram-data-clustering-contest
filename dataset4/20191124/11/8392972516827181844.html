      <p>Paying tribute to Liz - who he's known since they were eight - Kelvin described the moment that Liz walked down the aisle in 2015.</p>
      <p>He said: "When I saw her, she literally took my breath away. Every emotion, every memory ran through [me] - from being a kid, having a cheeky little kiss in the playground, holding hands, being best mates.</p>
      <p>"Best moment of my life."</p>

      <p>Kelvin also admitted that Liz was "the first girl I ever kissed."</p>
      <aside>I just want Liz to know how lucky I feel. I would not have able to do what I've done so far without you.</aside>
      <p>With tears in his eyes, he finished the touching tribute by saying: "I just want Liz to know how lucky I feel. I would not have able to do what I've done so far without you."</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before fans took to social media to express their delight with Kelvin's words.</p>
