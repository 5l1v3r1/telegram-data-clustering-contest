      <h3>Everybody wants to have an even skin tone, especially when it comes to the knuckles, elbows and knees.</h3>
      <p>But this is not always the case…and even if, sometimes, it does happen with the body, the knuckles, elbows, and knees are usually left out.</p>
      <p>The reason for this is because the skin around the elbows and knees are usually thicker than the skin surrounding it. Additionally, it has more folds (because of the joints) and tends to be much drier because those parts do not produce oil.</p>
