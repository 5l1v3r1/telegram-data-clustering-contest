      <h2>The BBC's Andrew Marr confronted the top Tory with comments by Dominic Cummings - as the host accused both Labour and Conservative figures of not telling the truth in the general election</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:09:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Michael Gove has been confronted on live TV with footage of Boris Johnson's top aide saying Tory MPs don't care about the NHS or the poor.</p>
      <p>The senior Tory was forced to disown <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-boris-johnson-aide-20789033">the 2017 comments by Dominic Cummings</a> after being played them in an excruciating interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr.</p>
      <p>It came as the BBC host accused both Mr Gove and Labour's Angela Rayner of not telling the truth as the Tories prepared to unveil their election manifesto.</p>
      <p>The presenter clashed with both parties - over the Tory pledge to put £500 in workers' pockets and the Labour pledge not to raise taxes for earners under £80,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Cummings was a senior aide to Mr Gove when he was Education Secretary before running the Vote Leave campaign and joining Mr Johnson in No10.</p>

      <p>He said at a conference two years ago: "People think - and by the way I think most people are right - 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don’t care about people like me'. That is what most people in the country have thought about the Tory party for decades.</p>
      <p>"I know a lot of Tory MPs, and I am sad to say the public is basically correct. Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don’t care about the NHS. And the public kind of has cottoned on to that."</p>
      <p>Humiliated Mr Gove was shown the clip and forced to respond on the Marr Show.</p>

      <p>He said: "He’s wrong about that - there are a number of occasions where I disagree with Dominic on this issue and some other matters as well."</p>
      <p>He added: "Dominic was working with me when at the Department for Education we devoted extra spending to our poorest students."</p>
      <p>Mr Marr clashed with both parties over their election pledges.</p>
      <p>The BBC host blasted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-gove">Michael Gove</a> for boasting workers would get £500 a year by cutting National Insurance - saying it "isn't actually true".</p>

      <p>In fact, workers would get around £85 in the first year and £500 eventually if the policy comes to fulfilment. And low earners wouldn't benefit as they are already under the threshold.</p>
      <p>Mr Marr said: "It sounds like every time the PM or other ministers say something we need an asterix and the note explaining what they really mean at the bottom!</p>
      <p>"This sounded to people like it was a very clear thing - you're going to get £500 for this - and it turns out, no you're not."</p>

      <p>Mr Gove insisted the pledge will be fulfilled by the end of a parliament in 2024.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Shadow Education Secretary was barracked over Labour's pledge not to raise Income Tax, National Insurance or VAT for earners below £80,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Marr pointed out Labour has pledged to remove the Married Tax Allowance, which cuts Income Tax for couples with one low earner by up to £250 per year.</p>
      <p>"I'm really sorry Angela Rayner but you are not being honest with the public," the BBC host said.</p>
      <p>Ms Rayner did not dispute the allowance would be scrapped but still insisted: "Everybody bar the top 5% will be better off under Labour."</p>
      <p>She said thanks to Labour's spending on tuition fees, childcare, public services, police and the NHS "the net value to families across the country is going to be significant" under a Corbyn government.</p>
      <p>She added: "To suggest that I'm being anything but honest I think is disingenuous."</p>
      <p>The shadow education secretary was also challenged on whether a future <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government would take a position on the deal it would negotiate with Brussels or not.</p>
      <p>"Well, that's a hypothetical," she told The Andrew Marr Show.</p>
      <p>Ms Rayner said her party will negotiate a deal that puts jobs and environment protections first and which will deal with the Northern Ireland border.</p>
      <p>"Within six months we'll put that back to the people and the people will decide, and then we'll move on," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Rayner said: "I think some of the problems that we have at the moment is the framing of this is that everybody's Remain, and that's just not true.</p>
      <p>"Actually the country did vote to leave the European Union, and we've said we respected that, so we're not going to be like the Lib Dems and just ignore that.</p>
      <p>"We will negotiate a deal and we'll put that back to the people, and they will have the ultimate say, and then we'll move on."</p>
