        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> suffered another disappointing result on Saturday as they scraped a 2-2 draw at home to Southampton, causing Alan Shearer to criticise a number of their players.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners needed a 96th minute equaliser from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexandre-lacazette/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> to rescue a point against the Saints as they took their winless run to six games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>’s side have picked up just four wins from their opening 13 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> matches, drawing six and losing three.</p>
      <p>Southampton had 21 shots during the contest in north London, with the home team extremely lucky to come away with even a point, and they were booed off by their own fans at full time.</p>
      <p>Premier League record goal-scorer Shearer could scarcely believe how bad the Gunners have become defensively and picked out four names that were especially bad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>‘Where do we start? They were sloppy, so bad defensively. [Kieran] Tierney set the tone after a couple of minutes, caught on the ball, poor touches,’ Shearer said on Match of the Day.</p>

      <p>‘[Lucas] Torreira then got caught on the ball, Arsenal got away with it. Six players and the manager are moaning to the referee when Southampton score, they were too clever for them.</p>
      <p>‘David Luiz… by the time the ball is in the net he’s not even in the box, it’s too late, he’s switching off.</p>

      <p>‘These mistakes are happening every single week trying to play out of the back but they’re not good enough to play out from the back, they keep giving chances away.</p>
      <p>‘I might get criticised for talking about fouling but what does [N’golo] Kante, Fabinho and Fernandinho do? They foul and they stop attacks.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a lack of experience from [Matteo Guendouzi] because look at the space Southampton have got to run into.’</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal captain Tony Adams was equally critical of Emery and his side after the draw with the Saints, launching a scathing rant on their defensive abilities.</p>
      <p>‘The boos are deserved. It was a terrible, terrible performance, very disjointed, no defending in sight, [Emery] changed his system three times – he’s not doing himself any favours,’ Adams told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>‘I could put a team together that is more organised than that. There’s no one going out there to keep clean sheets, I can’t see a clean sheet in sight. When you’re giving the opposition team at the Emirates 20 chances on your goal, you’re never going to keep clean sheets’</p>

      <p>However, Emery is certain that he retains the support of the players and the board.</p>
      <p>‘They are supporting me everyday,’ said the Spaniard. ‘I know we can do better and I’m going to try to do that.’</p>
