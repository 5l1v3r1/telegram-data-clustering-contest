      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer names Man Utd winger Daniel James as "best in the world"</h1>
      <h2>Daniel James has been a revelation at Man Utd since his summer transfer from Swansea - forming a dangerous front three with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:23:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:23</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has branded Daniel James as the "best defensive winger in the world".</p>
      <p>Wales international James moved to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> from Swansea in the summer for Â£15million - having never previously played in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>James has become a vital cog in Solskjaer's attack, having recently created an attacking trident with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.</p>
      <p>He has netted three times in 12 appearances in the league and has earned the praise of Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>When asked if he was surprised by James since his arrival, Solskjaer said: "Not really because when you sit down and speak to the boy you can see an ambitious, driven boy who knows what he wants.</p>

      <p>"He is very analytical and is critical of himself, so he is the right type. The attributes are what you see first. His speed, his one-against-one skills.</p>
      <p>"He is probably the best defensive winger in the world with his honesty, commitment and the way he does his recovery runs and doing his back tackles.</p>

      <p>"It is unbelievable, but that is also base for his attacking football because it gives him the space to run into, so I am not that surprised, though very pleased, of course.</p>
      <p>"He is only going to improve by the coaching and the exposure he gets at Old Trafford because when you are not fazed by (being) a Manchester United player then the limit must be sky-high."</p>
      <p>"When you're attacking quickly as we do we don't have time to doubt ourselves. The players now are confident, good form and are playing freely and on instinct.</p>
      <p>"I was an attacker and I know when I've been struggling for confidence you take an extra touch or think twice that's the period we went through six weeks ago, now it feels like if you give us the ball we will have a go."</p>
