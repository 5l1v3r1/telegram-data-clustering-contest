      <p>The 47th Annual Harvest and Thanksgiving Service held on November 17, 2019. The Preacher, Rev. Captain Dr. K. A. Kupoluyi (Spiritual Head, Faith in Int’l Church of C&amp;S) urged members of the congregation to examine themselves to see whether they are still in the faith.2 Corinthians 13vs5 says, “examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</p>
      <p>Will your name be found in the Book of Life? Your position will not make you enter Heaven. Luke 12vs47 says ‘And that servant, which knew his Lord’s will and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with stripes. Know your God, so that you will not be called a bastard. The Bible made us to understand that the word of God cannot go and return unaccomplished. What do we do, so that the ‘Grace’ will abound? </p>
      <p>Always examine yourselves, retrace your steps, seek God, do His will, now that the grace is still available. Stop every sinful act and humble yourself, so that God will lift you. The Kingdom of God is at hand. Not all that call God-God shall enter His Kingdom. God knows His own and will receive His own. Examine yourself, fear God, make amendment and be mindful of the word of God.Galatians 5vs13 says, “For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>
      <p>Kupoluyi prayed that the people of God will not end their race in tears, that higher grace will locate and envelope them to do the right things, regardless of every negative situation.</p>
      <p>Primate, Prophet S. O. Kogberegbe encouraged the congregation to pray for children nationwide, pray against kidnapping, pray for Nigeria as a nation; pray for God’s intervention in the lives of His people. He then released the fatherly blessings upon everyone present. He declared that from that day henceforth, the children of God would enjoy “Harvest Of Higher Grace.” Remain Blessed.<br/>THE HOLY MICHAEL CHURCH OF THE LORD (Aladura) Cherubim and Seraphim.<br/>12, Kogberegbe Street, Isolo, Opposite General Hospital Isolo, Lagos.</p>
