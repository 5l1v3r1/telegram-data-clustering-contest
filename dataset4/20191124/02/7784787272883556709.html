      <h1>Coulthard ‘happier’ after ending four-month wait with Newcastle Race 31 podium</h1>

      <h3>Fabian Coulthard will head into the summer break “a little bit happier” after he ended a four-month podium drought at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500 on Saturday.</h3>
      <p>Coulthard had failed to reach the top three in six events following the Townsville round in July – a stark contrast to his run to second in the standings after claiming nine podiums (including wins at Phillip Island and Perth) in the opening 18 races.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi has since dropped to fourth in standings, and is all but certain to remain there regardless of what happens in Sunday’s Race 32 finale.</p>

      <p>Race 31 on Saturday proved a blessed day for Coulthard, who ended his wait for a trophy – even if it took a slice of luck to get there following Jamie Whincup’s late off.</p>
      <p>Critically, Whincup’s error - coupled with a Scott McLaughlin-Coulthard podium - helped swing the teams’ championship battle Shell V-Power Racing’s way.</p>
      <p>Heading into Sunday’s race, the margin between the top two teams is 143 points.</p>
      <p>However, the smiles remained for Coulthard - who cast aside the Bathurst team orders scandal which threw his name into the spotlight - to return to the rostrum.</p>

      <p>“It’s nice to get back on the podium,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Obviously we have a long break after this one so even if we have a good run today like we did, you can go away over Christmas and be a little bit happier.</p>
      <p>“I think if you leave here and you’ve had a shocker, you’ve got a couple of months to think about it. It’s not like since Townsville I’ve gone, ‘I’m not bothered about a podium’.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been working just as hard at every event to do the best job you can, and we’ve had a couple of fourths and things like that where we’ve just been off the podium.</p>
      <p>“So we just keep coming back, keep pushing, keep trying and I think we’re starting to get a good direction.”</p>
      <p>Coulthard came close to the podium at Sandown, teaming with Tony D’Alberto to finish fourth.</p>
      <p>It took just one event for the Kiwi to rise one place, and Coulthard – who started sixth on Saturday – heaped the praise on his team for aiding his return to the top three, and strengthening the team’s grip on the fight for pit lane supremacy.</p>
      <p>“The strategy changed a fair bit on the run,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“We were doing one thing and then we weren’t, and then we were going to do this again and then we’re not.</p>
      <p>“I was a bit confused there at one point, but the boys did a good job, thinking on their feet.</p>
      <p>“That’s what this sport is about, you have got to have the team behind you and today we had a great team.</p>
      <p>“Any time you can have two cars on the podium, it’s a credit to everyone.”</p>
