      <h1>Raheem Sterling 'refusing to sign new £450,000-a-week contract' at Man City</h1>
      <h2>Sterling is reportedly stalling with Barcelona, Real Madrid and PSG all willing to sign him - but there is one factor that could swing new deal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:15:26+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:15</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Raheem Sterling is reportedly stalling on signing a new £450,000-a-week contract at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - until he knows whether Pep Guardiola is extending his stay at the club.</p>
      <p>City are keen to tie down Sterling to a new contract to keep the £200m-rated star out of the clutches of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and PSG.</p>
      <p>Sterling has scored 14 goals for his club so far this season, and another <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/raheem-sterlings-hilarious-response-disallowed-20948443">ruled out by VAR</a> in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-city-2-1-chelsea-20945552">City's 2-1 win</a> over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> at the Etihad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He is on track to beat his goalscoring record from the previous season - as he has done each campaign since signing from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> for £58m in 2015.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has become one of the world's top footballers under the guidance of Guardiola, and has a deep bond with the City manager.</p>

      <p>And according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10409661/raheem-sterling-pep-guardiola-contract-future-unclear/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574549034">Sun</a> , Sterling won't sign a new deal until his mentor Guardiola commits to the club beyond the end of his current contract, which expires at the end of next season.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiola-responds-claims-quit-20938529">rubbished rumours that he will leave City this summer</a> .</p>
      <p>But Sterling's current contract runs for another two years after that of his manager, expiring in the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>And if Guardiola leaves, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Sterling</a> wants to go with him, the Sun claims.</p>

      <p>The publication says when Guardiola first became City boss, he took Sterling under his wing and promised him he would become one of the world's best players and City's top earner.</p>
      <p>The first part of that promise has been fulfilled - and if Sterling accepts the £150,000-a-week pay rise he would indeed be the club’s best-paid star.</p>
      <p>Ahead of City's match against Chelsea, Guardiola said: "I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer. If the club wants, I will stay.”</p>
      <p>City fans will hope the Catalan can be tempted to extend his contract - and that their star man Sterling stays longer as well.</p>
