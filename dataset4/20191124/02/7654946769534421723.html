      <h1>Bloomberg fills foundation’s coffers ahead of possible presidential run</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:02:08+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:02</time> by <a rel="author">Melissa Klein</a></address>
      <p>Michael Bloomberg dug a little deeper <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/michael-bloomberg-to-spend-33m-in-a-single-week-on-2020-tv-ads/">into his very large pockets</a> last year, giving $458 million to his family foundation.</p>
      <p>The contribution by the former New York City mayor and Democratic presidential candidate was $8 million greater than in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Bloomberg Family Foundation, which has assets of $9 billion, doled out a total $445 million in dozens of grants to causes around the world, but cut back on some of its more local giving, the foundation’s tax filing shows.</p>
      <p>There was no cash for cultural groups in Bloomberg’s own backyard including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation, New York City Center and Vivian Beaumont Theater.</p>
      <p>It also bypassed NYC-based Doctors Without Borders, the Council on Foreign Relations, Inner-City Scholarship Fund and Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
      <p>Those groups had all been funded in 2017.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Bloomberg Philanthropies, the umbrella entity for all of the billionaire’s charitable giving, said the New York City organizations not funded by the foundation got grants either from the former mayor personally or his company, Bloomberg LP.</p>
      <p>The foundation heaped $81 million on Vital Strategies, a Manhattan-based nonprofit that concentrates on global public health needs, and $81 million on Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg’s alma mater.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg last year <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/18/bloomberg-donates-record-1-8b-to-johns-hopkins/">pledged $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins</a> for undergraduate financial aid allowing the school to admit students without regard to their ability to pay. That money began to flow this year.</p>
