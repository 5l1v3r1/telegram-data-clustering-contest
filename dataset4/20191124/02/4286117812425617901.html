      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Around 1.3Â crore UP farmers may not receive fourth installment under PM-KISAN scheme</li>
        <li>UP chief secretary RK Tiwari has asked authorities to rectify the issue at the earliest</li>
        <li>PM-KISAN scheme was announced by former finance minister Piyush Goyal in February this year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Loopholes in the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, which guarantees income support of Rs 6, 000 per annum to eligible farmers, could disappoint a major section of beneficiaries in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>Around 1.3 crore or 13 million farmers in the state may not receive the fourth installment due to the discrepancies in the entry of data on the portal.</p>
      <p>UP chief secretary RK Tiwari has written a letter to all the district magistrates (DMs) to ensure that the data is rectified by November 30 and all the beneficiaries get their due from December 1.</p>
      <p>The letter mentions that the information of 1.11 crore farmers in UP uploaded on the Centre's portal is incorrect.</p>
      <p>Names of the farmers, mentioned on the portal, do not match with the name written on their Aadhaar cards.</p>
      <p>If the issue is not rectified, farmers will not be able to get their fourth installment of Rs 2,000.</p>
      <p>The letter further highlights that the bank account details of at least 20 lakh farmers were incorrect and subsequently rejected by the Public Financial Management System (PFMC).</p>
      <p>UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed dissatisfaction over the slow redressal of the loopholes in the implementation of PM's flagship project in the country's most populous state.</p>
      <p>All the district magistrates have been directed by the chief secretary to ensure that the error is rectified by officials by the end of this month.</p>
      <p>PM-KISAN scheme was announced by former finance minister Piyush Goyal in February this year. Under the scheme, all small and marginal farmers are eligible to get Rs 6,000 every year in three installments as minimum income support. It was effective from December 2018.</p>
      <p>The scheme was launched by PM Modi in Gorakhpur ahead of the Lok Sabha elections by transferring the first installment of Rs 2,000 each to more than 1 crore farmers.</p>
