      <h1>Barcelona looking at three potential targets for the next summer</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona have their list of targets ready for the coming transfer window. As per <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1201761/reports-barcelona-messi-valverde-three-man-transfer-shortlist-summer-revealed-bayern-munich-joshua-kimmich-fiorentina-nikola-milenkovic-inter-milan-lautaro-martinez/"><b>Fox Sports</b></a>, the Catalan Giants are keeping tabs on Bayern’s Joshua Kimmich who is their full-back target and Filorentina’s Nikola Milenkovic who is their target for central defender. The Blaugranes are looking to replace Suarez as well.</h3>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde is looking to replace Pique at the back of the field who has been ageing as well, alongside Suarez. However, Valverde did reveal that if Pique is focused enough to play a game, he will play. Hence it is quite clear that whoever they sign will only be a cover for Pique for the time being.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that Suarez has been ageing and he has been slow and inconsistent off late. Hence it is quite obvious that Barcelona want to keep themselves covered.</p>
      <p>They are currently looking at Lautaro Martinez and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal. The latter was Arsenal’s top-scorer last season and has been impressive in recent times.</p>
      <p>Barcelona do need to make a few signings in the coming transfer window and not much thought needs to be put into it while saying it. The squad is set to undergo a major overhaul with the main priority revolving around grooming of the prospects for the club.</p>
      <p>Valverde needs to go ahead with the signings and needs to get rid of a few players who don’t fit into his plans anymore. They need to drop off Rakitic and Umtiti.</p>
