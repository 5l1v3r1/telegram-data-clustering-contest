      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 24 — The US Navy will proceed in its effort to oust a member of its elite SEAL commando unit, an official said yesterday, defying the wishes of President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Edward Gallagher had been accused of war crimes in a high-profile case but was found guilty only of a lesser offense. On November 15, Trump reversed the demotion handed down to the 40-year-old under his conviction.</p>
      <p>The Navy this week launched a procedure under which a peer review board could strip him and three other members of his unit of their Trident pins — effectively booting them from the SEALs.</p>
      <p>A rankled Trump declared on Twitter on Thursday that “The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, however, a senior Pentagon official who requested anonymity in order to speak freely said the “peer review board is proceeding.”</p>
      <p>Whether Gallagher can remain in the unit or not will be determined by a panel of Navy SEAL officers that is set to convene in December.</p>
      <p>The move came as multiple US news outlets reported that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer had threatened to resign over the affair, a claim he sharply denied.</p>
      <p>“Contrary to popular belief, I am still here. I did not threaten to resign,” Spencer said, speaking at a forum in Halifax, Canada.</p>
      <p>The US Navy chief said he did not consider Trump’s tweet to be a formal order.</p>
      <p>“I need a formal order to act,” Spencer told reporters on the sidelines of the forum.</p>
      <p>According to the US Constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, a 15-year Navy SEAL, had been accused in the stabbing death of a wounded Islamic State prisoner in Iraq in 2017, attempted murder of other civilians and obstruction of justice.</p>
      <p>In July, he was acquitted of charges related to those accusations, but was convicted of a lesser charge — posing with the slain fighter’s body in a group picture with other SEALs.</p>
      <p>As a result, he was demoted one rank, from chief petty officer to petty officer first class.</p>
      <p>Gallagher’s case had been championed by Fox News, which the president follows closely. — AFP</p>
