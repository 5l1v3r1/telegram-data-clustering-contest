      <h3>‘Queen Of Curves’ Abigail Ratchford Transforms Into Blonde Bombshell For Sultry Burlesque Inspired Photo</h3>

      <p>Abigail Ratchford, the self-dubbed “Queen Of Curves” has swapped her usual black hair for a blonde wig in the most recent photo on her Instagram page. In the closeup snapshot, the model appears to be wearing a lacy black bra that features embroidered floral details. There’s also an extra satin strap that stretches from the center of the undergarment to the side which draws extra attention to her cleavage. The rest of the outfit has been cropped out of the photo.</p>
      <p>In the caption, Abigail indicated that the photo was inspired by burlesque and her accessories fit that theme. She’s wearing red gloves and uses one of those gloved hands to cover her eyes. Shiny crimson lipstick coats her plump pout and from what we can see of her eyes, it looks like she’s wearing dark eyeliner and mascara.</p>
      <p>According to the caption, the bra is from Fashion Nova. While she didn’t share the name of the design, it looks like the bra could be a version of the bra in their “Straps and Lace Set” which retails for $19.99 on the brand’s website.</p>
      <p>The photo racked up over 52,000 likes and close to 120 comments in under an hour. In those comments, fans seemed enthralled by the photo.</p>
      <p>“Nice picture Abigail,” one fan wrote. “You’re the best model,”</p>
      <p>“One picture better than the other,” another wrote. “U will break the internet with such beauty!”</p>
      <p>“I never thought red could look so good on a woman till I saw this pic,” a third person gushed. “Wowsers.”</p>
      <p>A fourth fan got a lot more verbose in the comments than the others.</p>
      <p>“May this day be peaceful and not violent for you beautiful,” they wrote. “I also wanted to greet you and tell you that of all the flowers in the garden, the most beautiful is the rose and of all the women in the world, you are the most precious.”</p>

      <p>This is hardly the first time that Abigail has sported a blonde wig to promote Fashion Nova on her Instagram page. In a previous post, she’s wearing the wig beneath <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5752918/abigail-ratchford-floppy-hat/">a black wide-brimmed floppy hat</a> from the brand. The chic headwear has been pulled down to hide Abigail’s eyes but her crimson red lips are on full display, much like the most recent photo on her page. The model is topless in the photo but manages to maintain a sliver of modesty by covering her chest with hands that are in black satin gloves. Over 130,000 Instagram users have liked the photo and 800-plus users have commented on it.</p>
