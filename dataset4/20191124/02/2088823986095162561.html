      <p>The University at Buffalo men will face Missouri State for fifth place in the Charleston Classic (ESPNU, 1520 AM) and the women will take on No. 3 Stanford in today’s Big 4 basketball games.</p>
      <p>The UB men (3-2) are coming off a 76-73 win against Towson in the consolation bracket after falling to Connecticut in the opening round.</p>
      <p>Missouri State should be respected despite a 3-3 record. One of the Bears’ losses was by two points at Xavier. Another was by four points to Miami (Fla.) of the Atlantic Coast Conference in the first round in Charleston.</p>
      <p>Coach Dana Ford’s team rebounded from the 74-70 loss to Miami by defeating Saint Joseph’s, 61-59, on Friday. St. Joe’s has a win at Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Ford in his second season -- the Bears were 16-16 last season with a 10-8 record in the Missouri Valley Conference -- and has a team bolstered by transfers from four-year schools and junior colleges. One of the veterans is Brazil native Tulio DaSilva, who played at South Florida before transferring.</p>
      <p>Newly eligible is Lamont West a 6-8 graduate transfer forward who played three years at West Virginia. Another is 6-1 guard Tyrik Dixon, a transfer from Middle Tennessee. The winning points against Saint Joseph’s were by 6-7 Josh Hall, who played on Nevada’s Sweet Sixteen NCAA tournament team two seasons ago. Gaige Prim, a 6-8, 250 junior college transfer, led the scoring with 19 points against Saint Joseph’s.</p>
      <p>For UB, the Bulls closed the game on an 8-0 run to defeat Towson on Friday. Sophomore Josh Mballa put the Bulls ahead with a rebound basket with 23 seconds left. Jayvon Graves made two free throws, giving him 25 points in the game, with seven seconds to widen the lead. Sophomore Ronaldo Segu added two more free throws.</p>
      <p>Mballa had 13 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
      <p>UB’s women suffered their first loss, 95-88, at San Jose State on Thursday in the first game of their West Coast trip. Now they face an undefeated Stanford team (4-0) coached by Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Famer Tara VanDerveer at Maples Pavilion in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
      <p>Coach Felisha Legette-Jack’s UB team is one of two in the country to have two players averaging 22 points per game. Dyaisha Fair, a freshman from Rochester, leads the nation with a 26.4 average and senior Theresa Onwuka averages 22.0.</p>
      <p>VanDerveer, a former Niagara Falls resident who graduated from Buffalo Seminary, annually attracts some of the best women’s basketball talent to The Farm.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal is led by 6-foot sophomore Lexie Hull, who is averaging 16.5 points. Her twin sister, Lacie (6-1) is also on the team.</p>
      <p>VanDerveer has a 1,071-267 record in her 40 years as a collegiate head coach, 919-196 over 33 seasons at Stanford.</p>
      <p>Most impressive of the Cardinal victories is a 76-70 overtime triumph against Gonzaga.</p>
      <h3>Bona women lose</h3>
      <p>Emily Calabrese had 12 points and 15 rebounds, her first double-double of the season and third of her career for St. Bonaventure, in a 65-62 loss to Cleveland State on Saturday at the Reilly Center.</p>
      <p>A three by Jurnee President of Bona tied the game at 60 before the Vikings’ Mariah White stole the ball and scored again. The Bonnies had led most of the game.</p>
      <p>Bona (1-5) will play at Binghamton at 1 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
