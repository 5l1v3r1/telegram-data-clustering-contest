      <p>In a goof up, the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) attached veteran lyricist-poet Gulzar’s picture instead of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s in the director’s biography of <i>Ganashatru</i> on its official website.</p>
      <p>The screenshot of the webpage of the homage section of IFFI website, featuring Gulzar’s picture as the director of the 1989 Bengali film went viral on social media on Friday.</p>
      <p>However, soon after reports of the mix up started doing the rounds, the festival organisers rectified the mistake.</p>
      <p>The 50th edition of IFFI started on November 20, with actors Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth attending the opening ceremony.</p>
      <p>The festival will conclude on November 28.</p>
