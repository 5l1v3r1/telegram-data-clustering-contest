      <p>Elon Musk says Tesla has received nearly 150,000 orders for its new electric pickup truck since the automaker revealed the futuristic vehicle earlier this week to mixed reviews.</p>
      <p>The Tesla CEO tweeted on November 23 that the company received 146,000 orders for the wedge-shaped "Cybertruck" since its unveiling November 21 night.</p>
      <p>Musk said 17 per cent of the orders are for the single-motor model, 42 per cent are for the dual-motor version and 41 per cent are for the tri-motor model.</p>

      <p>The much-hyped unveiling went off script when its supposedly unbreakable window glass splintered twice when hit with a large metal ball. Some analysts panned the truck's blocky, angular looks.</p>
      <p>During the demonstration, Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, smashed the Cybertruck with a sledgehammer, which the truck withstood. However, after that things started going wrong. Holzhausen took a metallic ball in his hand and tossed it at the truck, smashing the front window leaving the audience stunned during the live stream of the event.</p>

      <p>Placing an order costs buyers $100, which Tesla says is fully refundable. The company has said the "Cybertruck," which starts at $39,900, will be in production in 2021.</p>
      <p>According to Tesla, the most powerful truck can tow up to 14,000 pounds and travel up to 500 miles on a single charge. Interestingly, Musk also claims that the truck has an acceleration of a Porsche.</p>
