      <p>In the week since Colin Kaepernick worked out for seven NFL teams at Charles R. Drew High School in Riverdale, Georgia, no teams have reached out to work him out, visit with him or sign him, league sources told ESPN.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, 32, remains unemployed, and NFL teams remain uninterested in his services -- the same story that has followed the former <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> quarterback for almost three years.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick's representatives sent video of their client's workout to the 25 NFL teams that did not attend last Saturday, but that has not led to any interest, either.</p>
      <p>The fact that the NFL tried to spark interest in Kaepernick last week, and could not, and that his reps made sure that video of the workout was delivered to every team, are just the latest signs that the chances are bleak that a team will step forward and sign him.</p>
      <p>Some sources speculated that there had been teams interested in making a move with Kaepernick, and could in the weeks after his workout. But nothing has materialized, and nothing is expected to at this time.</p>
      <p>After completing his 40-minute workout on Nov. 16, Kaepernick said he's ready for another opportunity and wants the league to "stop running'' from him.</p>
      <p>"I've been ready for three years,'' Kaepernick said. "I've been denied for three years. We all know why I came out here. [I] showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. So we're waiting for the 32 owners, 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running. Stop running from the truth. Stop running from the people."</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, who in 2012-13 quarterbacked the 49ers to an appearance in the Super Bowl, protested police brutality and social injustice by kneeling during the pregame national anthem and has been out of football since 2016.</p>
      <p>The NFL originally scheduled the workout to take place at the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons">Falcons</a>' facility, but Kaepernick's camp switched venues after a disagreement between the two sides on the quarterback's liability waiver and media availability, among other factors.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the NFL said it was "disappointed that Colin did not appear for his workout.''</p>
      <p>The change in venue interrupted schedules for many of the 25 teams that were set to watch Kaepernick at the original site, but Kaepernick still threw in front of representatives from the Niners, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles">Eagles</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs">Chiefs</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">Jets</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Redskins</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions">Lions</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans">Titans</a>.</p>
