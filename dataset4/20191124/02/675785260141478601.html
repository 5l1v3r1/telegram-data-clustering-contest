      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Ambulance dispatcher Luke Wright and paramedics Christopher Gill and Richard Grimes all died suddenly after a whistleblower raised concerns about psychological abuse</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:23:10+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:23</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Selby, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>An ambulance service where three staff have died of suspected suicide in two weeks has been accused of a toxic culture.</p>
      <p>Ambulance dispatcher Luke Wright, 24, and paramedics Christopher Gill and Richard Grimes were found dead between November 11 and November 21.</p>
      <p>Shortly before their deaths a whistleblower wrote to the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust’s boss complaining about psychological abuse.</p>
      <p>Former health minister and local Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who also received the letter, is calling for an independent investigation into the deaths.</p>
      <p>He said: “For three people working on the front line to lose their lives within such a short space of time is deeply shocking.</p>
      <p>“It does raise a question as to whether there needs to be a thorough internal investigation.</p>

      <p>"I am conscious that people have complained about a toxic culture in this trust. I’ve been appalled by some of the behaviours that I’ve seen in the organisation.”</p>
      <p>Dad-of-one Luke was in Norwich while Chris was from Welwyn Garden City, Herts, and Richard in Luton, Beds.</p>
      <p>Luke’s brother Daniel, who also works for the service, said: “We need to highlight that it is OK not to be OK. People need to talk to get help.”</p>
      <p>The whistleblower’s letter, uncovered by the Ambulance News Desk site, claimed that bullying behaviour was undermining staff confidence.</p>
      <p>It said: “If this situation continues the risk of suicide and increase risk to patients will result in reputational damage to the NHS and potential loss of life.”</p>
      <p>Dr Tom Davis, medical director of the service, said: “We will not be ­commenting on the unfortunate and tragic loss of our colleagues recently as we need to be sympathetic</p>
      <p>“But we encourage staff to seek support when they need it and to speak up if they are suffering with mental health.”</p>
