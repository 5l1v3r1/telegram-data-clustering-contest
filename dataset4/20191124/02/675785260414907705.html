      <h1>Girls Aloud trio respond to claims they have a WhatsApp group to slag off Nadine</h1>
      <h2>Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh say they only want her to do well in the Outback - and that none of them have been voting for her to do the grueling Bushtucker trials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:56:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:56</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Nadine Coyle's former bandmates have dismissed suggestions they are part of a WhatsApp group slagging off the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> star.</p>
      <p>Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh have all distanced themselves from claims they have been attacking the Irish camp-mate.</p>
      <p>Accusations came that they had created a message group which poked fun at her - and vote for the 34-year-old to do the Bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>But hitting back, the former Girls Aloud stars issued a statement through <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html">MailOnline</a> which said they only have "love for each other" - despite their differences.</p>
      <p>Cheryl said: "We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.</p>

      <p>"We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!"</p>
      <p>And Kimberley also slammed the rumours, and said she found it hard to watch when Nadine broke down in tears prior to her skydive.</p>
      <p>"I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there," she said.</p>

      <p>Nicola added: "We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity, this just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show."</p>
      <p>A source alleged to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> the trio thought "it would be funny to vote for Nadine to do the Bushtucker Trials" as "it’s all a bit of a laugh".</p>
      <p>While Nadine has been appearing on I'm A Celeb, the Irish beauty addressed the rumoured rift between her former bandmates.</p>

      <p>An intrigued Kate Garraway asked the brunette beauty why she wasn’t friends with the other members of Girls Aloud or saw them.</p>
      <p>Nadine replied: "Everyone gets on with their lives, I was friends with them all, it was all nice and lovely.</p>
      <p>"But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys, I’d be out partying, me and ten guys, I was having a laugh, I was 18-19 years old."</p>
