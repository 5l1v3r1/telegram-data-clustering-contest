      <p>Victoria's $50 billion suburban rail loop will run on its own line with dedicated trains.</p>
      <p>The 90-kilometre rail ring will be a seperate twin-tunnel line to be integrated into the existing public transport network, the state government announced on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"The suburban rail loop will be a dedicated line with dedicated trains - and it will change the way our city and state moves forever," Transport Infrastructure Minister Jacinta Allan said.</p>
      <p>It means the existing network won't need to have the new technology retrofitted, and the train design won't be held back by the city's century-old train network.</p>
      <p>The trains will be smaller - four to five carriages long - allowing them to run more often and faster than the existing fleet.</p>
      <p>The loop will connect to an airport rail and create three transport super hubs at Clayton, Broadmeadows and Sunshine.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Michael O'Brien said the government was quiet about the cost of the rail loop and where it needed to put the stations.</p>
      <p>"It's a train that has got no deadline and no financial costs written down," he said.</p>
      <p>The geotechnical work is underway between route from Box Hill to Cheltenham, and will be used to determine the final alignment, station locations and how it'll be built.</p>
      <p>Building works are expected to start in late 2022 and finish by 2051.</p>
