      <p>A Delhi Court on Saturday stayed the makers of upcoming Bollywood film <i>Chanda: A Signature that Ruined a Career</i> from screening, exhibiting or marketing till further orders the movie which is allegedly based on the life of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar.</p>
      <p>Additional District Judge Sandeep Garg passed the directions on a complaint filed through advocate Vijay Aggarwal, who claimed that the content of the film was “defamatory” as “it makes insinuations and judgments about the life of the plaintiff (Kochhar).”</p>
      <p>The court issued notice to the producer, director and others associated with the film for November 26 when it will next hear the matter.</p>
      <p>“All the defendants and their associates... are hereby restrained from using the name of the plaintiff directly or indirectly; screening, exhibiting or marketing the film, online or offline, whole or in part or in any other form... till the next date of hearing,” the court said.</p>
      <p>In the complaint, Ms. Kochhar said that she has “never been approached for obtaining her consent to use her name and make a film on her life, by the defendants.”</p>
      <p>The film was projected as a biopic on her life.</p>
