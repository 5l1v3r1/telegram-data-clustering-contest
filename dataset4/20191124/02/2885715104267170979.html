      <p>A pair of Asiatic lions and a Bengal tigress will soon be on public display at Chhatbir zoo.</p>
      <p>Four-year-old twins Baban and Gagan and the Bengal tigress were brought under the animal exchange program from Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalaya in Indore and they reached Chhatbir Zoo on October 20.</p>
      <p>They were kept in the isolation — a set procedure under Central Zoo Authority (CZA) guidelines for making the recently shifted animals acclimatized to the changed atmosphere — for one month within the zoo.</p>
      <p>A senior officer at the zoo said, “These carnivores will be on public display shortly because their isolation period has completed. The exact date is yet to be confirmed. For the first one fortnight, Baban and Gagan will not be allow to mix up with the other lions and lionesses in the Lion Safari of zoo. They will be released in a separate large enclosure divided from the main lion safari with long fencing. After observing their behaviour, they will be released in the main lion safari.”</p>
      <p>A high-level meeting chaired by Zoo Director, M Sudhagar, discussing the how and where to put these animals for public sighting took place at Chhatbir Zoo on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, white tigress Diya, which recently delivered four cubs — one of them did not survive, has been recovering. She has adopted her offsprings very well.</p>
      <p>Veterniary doctors along with zookeepers are making efforts to make Diya’s partner, Aman, a royal Bengal tiger, who is currently separated from Diya and cubs, adoptative towards the cubs.</p>
      <p>A zoo officer said, “As per the nature, a male tiger can not tolerate cubs and eliminate the offsprings due to the affection towards female. Aman is being shown video clips of recently born cubs hence he can adopt them. Before the delivery, Diya, at her dark enclosure, was also shown clips of deliveries of the litter of cubs.”</p>
