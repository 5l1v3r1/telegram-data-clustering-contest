      <h1>How Saints’ Michael Thomas became the best receiver in NFL</h1>

      <p>Even before NFL defensive backs found out they Can’t Guard Mike, the best wide receiver in the NFL made it his Twitter handle.</p>
      <p>And now, he is a threat to break the single season record for receptions (143) set in 2002 by former Colts great Marvin Harrison.</p>
      <p>Why can’t they guard Mike? It’s not as if, with 4.57 speed, he can take the top off a defense like Tyreek Hill. He never made that Odell Beckham Jr. catch. He was drafted in the second round of the 2016 draft, after fellow receivers Corey Coleman, Will Fuller Josh Doctson, Laquon Treadwell and Sterling Shepard.</p>
      <p>Saints public relations was gracious enough to get Michael Thomas on the phone for Serby Says. In an effort to find an answer to the question, Why can’t they guard Mike? I asked him if I were to build the perfect receiver, what would I take from Michael Thomas?</p>
      <p>“My hands,” Thomas says immediately.</p>
      <p>“The way I know how to create separation.</p>
      <p>“And probably my competitiveness for sure . Not caring about who’s in front of me.”</p>

      <p>Keyshawn Johnson, you may recall, didn’t care about who was in front of him and wanted quarterbacks to just give him the damn ball.</p>
      <p>Like uncle, like nephew.</p>
      <p>Same question for Keyshawn: What would I take from Michael Thomas?</p>
      <p>“I think his hands and his catch radius,” Keyshawn said.</p>
      <p>I asked Keyshawn why they Can’t Guard Mike.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s his work ethic … his willingness to not be guarded … attention to detail … all of those sort of things,” Keyshawn said. “When you’re running the right routes and you’re doing everything the right way, you’ll be difficult to guard.”</p>
      <p>Long before Thomas became Can’t Guard Mike, before he began opening eyes at Woodland (Calif.) Taft High School and Urban Meyer’s Ohio State, Keyshawn remembers him being a 10-year-old on a mission.</p>

      <p>“He used to want to get a lot of my video and cutups and stuff like that and look at ’em as a kid,” Keyshawn said. “I remember he used to call me: ‘You gotta get me your clips and some plays from your coaches.’ ”</p>
      <p>Yet another example of the draft bring an inexact science: Thomas was the 47th pick.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the general managers and the scouts look at the wrong things and attributes of a player,” Keyshawn said. “They start paying attention to speed, and this guy has more production ’caused he played longer. … They got it wrong, basically, at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>“Being with him on draft day, it was a little bit of a disappointment, but I told him he went to the perfect place, and all those guys who went in the first round or anybody that went before you, they’ll all be behind you by the time your career ends.”</p>
      <p>Thomas caught 125 passes last season for 1,405 yards and nine touchdowns. This season he has 94 catches for 1,141 yards and five TDs with six games to go.</p>
      <p>At 6-foot-3 and 203 pounds, he is slightly smaller than Keyshawn, who was listed at 6-4, 212 in his heyday.</p>
      <p>“We kind of do some of the same stuff,” Keyshawn said. “The willingness to catch in traffic, that sort of stuff. A red-zone nightmare.”</p>
      <p>Keyshawn struggled to find the right comparison for Can’t Guard Mike.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t have the 4.3 clock speed, but I don’t need 4.3 clock speed. … I need play-making ability,” Keyshawn said. “To me, he’s a more physical Isaac Bruce, I would say. … I don’t know that there’s a comp. He’s got like his own deal, I would say.”</p>
      <p>So what is his deal? “He goes and gets the football when it’s in the air,” Keyshawn said.</p>
      <p>And because he does, the Saints made him the league’s highest paid receiver (five years for $100 million with $81 million guaranteed). And because he had just three drops last season and four this season, he is in the MVP conversation behind Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson, even though no receiver had ever won the honor.</p>
      <p>Thomas didn’t tail off when Teddy Bridgewater had to replace Drew Brees (thumb) for five games. Thomas and Brees have developed a telepathy not unlike what Jerry Rice and Joe Montana enjoyed.</p>
      <p>“Just attention to detail,” Thomas said. “I take his job and my job very seriously.”</p>
      <p>Brees gushes about his go-to guy’s growth and commitment to excellence.</p>
      <p>“Listen, he’s a special guy,” Brees said this week. “Tell Mike the route, he’ll assess the coverage, he’ll know how he needs to run it based upon who he is running against as well because he studies the guys, right? He knows who’s defending him, right? He’s going to run the route maybe differently versus some guys than others. That’s part of being a great receiver is understanding that element.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“He is going to get open. He is going to look you dead in the eye and say, ‘I am going to get open.’ And you believe him, you trust him. You anticipate it and you throw it, and most of the time he is right. That makes for a great receiver. You look at all the numbers and you look at everything else and it shows. He’s on pace to do some pretty remarkable things.”</p>
      <p>He will walk the talk if defensive backs start talking smack.</p>
      <p>“If they want to take it there, we can take it there,” Thomas said. “I don’t care who’s in front of me, I just play my game. If they want to talk, we can talk, if they want to be quiet we can be quiet. I just gotta make my plays and play my game.”</p>
      <p>Hold on, Keyshawn might have a comparison for his nephew after all.</p>
      <p>“I actually talked to Sean Payton way before the draft during the draft process,” Keyshawn said, “and told Sean, ‘He’s a bigger, faster Marques Colston. He’s the best receiver in the draft, Sean.’ ”</p>
      <p>Thomas no longer keeps tabs on the receivers selected before him.</p>
      <p>“That would be foolish of me to do that,” Thomas said.</p>
      <p>He’s fixated more on winning a Super Bowl, and justice for an organization and city that was jobbed in the NFC Championship game last season when interference was not called on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, than he is breaking Harrison’s record.</p>
      <p>“It’s not like to get to 150 they throw him 500,” Keyshawn said. “Let’s say he catches 150. He will only probably have had 200 targets. That’s the crazy part.”</p>
      <p>That’s why Brees will just keep giving Keyshawn Johnson’s nephew the damn ball. Because they Can’t Guard Mike.</p>
