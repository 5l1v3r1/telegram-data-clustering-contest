      <p>MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) - A Milwaukee man who was living in an underground bunker that contained a stash of weapons is facing two felony counts.</p>
      <p>Forty-one-year-old Geoffrey Graff appeared in court Saturday on charges of recklessly endangering safety and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Commissioner Cedric Cornwall set his cash bail at $20,000.</p>
      <p>The bunker measured 8 feet (2.4 meters) deep, 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide, and 20 feet (6.1 meters) long.</p>
      <p>Authorities say a search of the underground encampment yielded two shotguns, a pistol, a long rifle, and a bow with snowplow stakes for arrows. It also had a grill, propane tanks, a generator and various power tools.</p>
      <p>Graff allegedly told authorities he had been using the bunker for at least seven years.</p>
      <p>A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Dec. 3. It wasn't immediately clear if Graff has an attorney.</p>
