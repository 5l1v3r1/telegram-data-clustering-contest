      <p>Keigwin and Company Inc., in association with the Oklahoma Film + Music Office, has announced the completion of principal photography on the short film “Bolero Seniors.”</p>
      <p>The production began principal photography in Oklahoma City in October, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>The short film is being produced by Keigwin and Company founder Larry Keigwin, a native New Yorker, choreographer and curator. Keigwin has created 26 works for Keigwin and Company, including the acclaimed large-scale community dance project “Bolero,” which has been commissioned in 15 communities across the country.</p>
      <p>Also producing the short is Andy Kokoszka, a filmmaker from New York City who is currently residing in Oklahoma City. Longtime friends Keigwin and Kokoszka joined together to bring a variation of “Bolero” to Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>“Bolero Seniors” follows a vibrant community of senior citizens over the course of a day at the pool. The cast are all authentic senior citizens living in Oklahoma City, and the entire film is set to the iconic score of “Bolero,” culminating in senior-citizen water ballet, according to the news release.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been dreaming about creating a new dance film to the iconic score of Maurice Ravel's ‘Bolero’ for almost seven years and I was thrilled to be coming to my home in the west to shoot this ebullient new film,” said Keigwin in a statement. “As we track a day in the life of seniors living in Oklahoma City in ‘Bolero Seniors,’ we hope to celebrate the joy of actively aging while poignantly touching on the challenges.”</p>
      <p>Oklahoma Film + Music Office Director Tava Maloy Sofsky said her office is excited that Keigwin and Company chose Oklahoma City to take part in the national project.”</p>
      <p>“Casting senior citizens to lead a contemporary dance film fits in well with the creative energy that the Oklahoma film industry has been fostering, and the ‘Bolero Seniors’ short film has been a fun, fresh way to showcase the range of diversity our local talent has to offer,” Sofsky said in a statement.</p>
