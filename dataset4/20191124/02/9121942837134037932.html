      <p>LEVI, Finland (AP) — French skier Clement Noel has posted the fastest time in the opening run of the first men’s World Cup slalom of the season on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Competing in foggy conditions and snowfall, Noel built a lead of 0.39 seconds over Britain’s Dave Ryding.</p>
      <p>Ramon Zenhaeusern of Switzerland trailed by 0.66, and Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway was two-hundredths further back in fourth.</p>
      <p>Noel had his breakthrough in the final two months of last season. Without a World Cup podium finish to his name, Noel finished runner-up in Adelboden in January before winning races in Wengen, Kitzbuehel and Soldeu.</p>
      <p>It earned him second place, shared with Switzerland’s Daniel Yule, in the slalom season standings, behind record eight-time overall champion Marcel Hirscher, who has now retired.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Yule was 0.94 seconds back in seventh, while Noel’s French teammate Alexis Pinturault, who won the season-opening giant slalom last month, finished 2.48 off the lead and failed to qualify for the second run.</p>
