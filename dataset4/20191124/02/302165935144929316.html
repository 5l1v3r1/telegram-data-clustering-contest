      <p>DETROIT, Nov 24 — As a child living in Detroit, Teresa Moon didn’t know anything about the concrete stone wall she could see from the kitchen window in her family’s home.</p>
      <p>Sixty years on, in that same kitchen, she knows all about the Birwood Wall, or the 8 Mile Wall, which was built in the 1940s to separate her black neighbourhood from a housing project aimed at white families.</p>
      <p>“We live in a community that is about building confidence, about ownership about being proud of who you are. Why would my parents tell me something about that?” Moon confides, haltingly.</p>
      <p>“That would kind of dispel all that — like, I got a wall to keep me separate from other people,” said the charismatic 66-year-old former city worker.</p>
      <p>Moon has become something of the spokeswoman for the “8 Mile” neighbourhood — named for the road that long separated the predominantly black city from the mainly white suburbs.</p>
      <p>8 Mile earned pop culture fame thanks to white rapper Eminem, whose biopic was named for the neighbourhood. But, Moon points out, he wasn’t from the area — he grew up in the nearby city of Warren.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people claim 8 Mile because it’s something to claim,” she says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not an accident</b>
      </p>
      <p>The entire Detroit area was propelled for decades by the auto industry, but Motor City is now one of the poorest major urban centres in America.</p>
      <p>Moon moved to 8 Mile when she was six, at a time when racial segregation was still the norm in the United States.</p>
      <p>Despite the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation and the constitutional abolition of slavery in America, laws remained in place that mandated the separation of races.</p>
      <p>In some states, those laws remained in effect in the late 1950s and 1960s. But even after that, the spectre of segregation effectively kept some places segregated for decades to follow.</p>
      <p>Some still are separated.</p>
      <p>“Detroit is the most segregated metropolitan area in the country,” says Eric Williams, a lawyer for the non-profit Detroit Justice Center.</p>
      <p>“That doesn’t happen by accident. It just doesn’t. (...) There are tons of neighbourhoods in Detroit that just simply did not allow black people to live there.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blacks couldn’t ‘become more’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Moon recalls that when her family moved to their home in 8 Mile, seven of them had to live in three rooms.</p>
      <p>She only met white kids for the first time when she went to junior high school.</p>
      <p>“That’s the first time I interacted with white people in my life. I only saw them on TV” before that, she said.</p>
      <p>In her kitchen, she opens up an issue of Collier’s magazine, from 1946, and points at a picture of black children sitting along the Birwood Wall, while on the other side, white teenagers are playing.</p>
      <p>The wall is about six feet high (1.8 metres) and easily scaled. But the barrier it posed was clear-cut.</p>
      <p>“The government wouldn’t insure white owners’ mortgages until a wall separating Negroes was put up,” read the caption under the photo in Collier’s.</p>
      <p>Detroit’s black 8 Mile neighbourhood had already existed for decades. But in the midst of a post-war housing boom, developers were attracted to the area, and wanted to build a white neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>“That was the concept — if you live near black people, then your neighbourhood is never going to be good. So let’s build a wall,” explains Moon.</p>
      <p>After a lengthy silence, she summarised the notion, calling it “crazy” — and emotionally punctuating her thought with an expletive.</p>
      <p>On her family’s side of the wall, “black people couldn’t get mortgages, black people couldn’t get loans, black people couldn’t... you know, become more, couldn’t develop wealth like generational wealth — couldn’t get nothing,” she said.</p>
      <p>The situation left people thinking “black people can’t do anything. They never thought a black man would be the president of the United States,” said Moon — Barack Obama is among the many faces that decorate her kitchen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘A pride thing’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The wall has more than just bad memories: Moon also remembers playing there with her friends. Scaling it was something of a rite of passage. She never tried it, she says with a smile.</p>
      <p>At age 13 or 14, she finally understood why it was there.</p>
      <p>“Just to learn the disparities that the people of my colour had to live through because of the colour of our skin... was crazy to me,” she said.</p>
      <p>Today, the neighbourhood is still “98, 99 per cent” black, Moon notes.</p>
      <p>The downturn in the auto industry, the financial crisis of a decade ago and Detroit’s municipal bankruptcy in 2013 did not make things any easier for residents.</p>
      <p>The wall is now in a freshly redone park for children. Artists and locals covered it with colourful murals in 2006, depicting key moments in the history of the site. It has been designated a historic landmark.</p>
      <p>Above all, Moon explains, being from 8 Mile is “a pride thing.”</p>
      <p>“Detroit is a very poor city,” she says.</p>
      <p>But 8 Mile “has always been a very strong and committed and loving place to live. So that’s why I’m still here.” — AFP</p>
