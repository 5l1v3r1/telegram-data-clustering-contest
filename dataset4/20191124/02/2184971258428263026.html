      <p>The former head of MI6 has called Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn a danger to national security who is unfit to lead the country.</p>
      <p>Sir Richard Dearlove has written in the Mail on Sunday that Mr Corbyn would pose a “present danger to our country” if he became prime minister and has access to top-secret files.</p>
      <p>Sir Richard, who spent 38 years with Britain’s intelligence service, said Mr Corbyn’s past political activities would make him a security risk if he was in possession of such sensitive information.</p>

      <p>“Today, in the home of parliamentary democracy, we are faced with the possibility that a leader of the Labour Party who once preferred East Germany’s political and economic model of government could become prime minister,” Sir Richard wrote.</p>
      <p>“A nightmare, the stuff of fantasy? Unfortunately not.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Do not even think of taking the risk of handing this politician the keys to No 10.”</p>
      <p>Sir Richard highlighted Corbyn advisers Andrew Murray – a former member of Britain’s Communist Party – and Seumas Milne, who “kept company with extremist political movements”.</p>
      <p>“Corbyn, Murray and Milne have at times each denigrated their own country and embraced the interests of its enemies and opponents,” Sir Richard wrote.</p>
      <p>“Their record is not in question. A few Labour politicians have courageously spoken out against them but it is worrying that more have not done so.”</p>
