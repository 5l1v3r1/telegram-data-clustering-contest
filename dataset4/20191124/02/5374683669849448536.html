      <p>A man was arrested on Saturday night after <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272118">a video of a Tube passenger</a> directing abuse at Jewish children was released, the <i>BBC</i> reports.</p>
      <p>The clip, which was posted to YouTube, showed a man reading anti-Semitic Bible passages to two boys wearing kippahs and their father.</p>
      <p>British Transport Police launched an appeal over the footage, recorded by a commuter on the London Underground.</p>
      <p>The force said it had arrested a man in Birmingham on suspicion of a racially aggravated offense, according to the <i>BBC</i>.</p>
      <p>A Muslim woman, who was widely praised after she was seen confronting the man in the video, has said she "wouldn't hesitate to do it again".</p>
      <p>Asma Shuweikh, from London, said she wished more people had intervened when the man started being aggressive towards other passengers on the Northern Line service.</p>
      <p>Recalling the altercation on Friday, she said if "everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did."</p>
      <p>"Being a mother of two, I know what it's like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation," she added.</p>
      <p>Commuter Chris Atkins recorded the altercation before moving to swap seats with the young boy next to the man.</p>
      <p>"It was the children that really got me and everyone else, he was just screaming at these children. It was horrific in every sense," he was quoted as having said.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270435">A report</a> released in August by Britainâ€™s Jewish community found that a record number of nearly 900 anti-Semitic incidents had been recorded in the United Kingdom for the first six months of 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270309">A government report</a> released last month found that the number of religion-based hate crimes against Jews in England and Wales nearly doubled in 2018.</p>
