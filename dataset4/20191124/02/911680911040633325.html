          <figcaption>LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 22: The tailpipe of a vehicle is seen next to a school bus and contributing emissions that are the nation?s second worst on March 22, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. According to a recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Los Angeles ranks only behind New York with the dirtiest and most hazardous air to breathe. The citizens of Los Angeles breathe cleaner air than they did in the 1970's and face a cancer risk that is about twice the national average.

      <p>MESA, AZ â€” Mesa Public Schools is set to address recent <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/mesa/documents-reveal-big-spending-by-mesa-public-schools">reports of overspending</a> before its board meeting Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Members will hold a study session regarding "General Administration Expenses for FY 18 and FY 19."</p>
      <p>ABC15 found the district spent $750,000 more than was budgeted in that category. The district recently said a pre-payment for liability insurance was to blame for that. A spokesperson for the district says Tuesday's study session will, "explain there was no overspending."</p>
      <p>That session is open to the public. Starts at 4:00 p.m. at the Curriculum Services Center, 549 North Stapley Drive in Mesa.</p>
      <p>This comes nearly a week after the board <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/mesa/mesa-public-schools-holding-special-meeting">put Superintendent Dr. Ember Conley on paid administrative</a> leave without saying why. Members will discuss Conley's contract with an attorney in executive session before their regular meeting starts at 7:00 p.m.</p>
      <p>The district released <a href="http://www.mpsaz.org/info">this written response Friday, November 22,</a> regarding recent reports.</p>
