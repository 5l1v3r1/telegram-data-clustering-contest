      <blockquote><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> returns to a familiar spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, as his latest release, <i>Jesus Is King</i>, debuts at No. 1. It’s his record-tying ninth consecutive debut at No. 1, matching <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/eminem">Eminem</a>’s still-active streak for the longest in the chart’s history. <i>Jesus Is King</i> was released on Oct. 25 via G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam Recordings and earned 264,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the week ending Oct. 31, according to Nielsen Music. Of that sum, 109,000 were in album sales, while the rest was powered largely by streaming activity. (Billboard)</blockquote>
