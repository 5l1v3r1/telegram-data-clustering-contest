      <h1>China going big on coal guarantees the world won’t meet its carbon-cutting goals</h1>

      <p>Pretty much everything the rest of the world is doing to reduce carbon emissions is being neutralized by a single big, bad actor — and it’s not the United States under President Trump, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20112019/china-ramps-coal-power-despite-pressure-cut-emissions">but the People’s Republic of China</a>.</p>
      <p>Many countries are falling short of the decarbonization goals hammered out at the 2016 Paris climate convention. But Beijing — already the world’s No. 1 carbon emitter, producing more than a quarter of global CO2 exhausts — stands out. With its economy slowed to a rate not seen since the early ’90s, it’s re-embracing the dirtiest fossil fuel.</p>
      <p>The International Energy Agency notes that coal accounts for 46% of global carbon emissions. To meet the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change target of keeping global warming below 1.5°C through 2100, the world much achieve, as Global Energy Monitor puts it, a “58[%] to 70% reduction in global coal power generation by 2030.”</p>
      <p>GEM, a not-for-profit that tracks global coal use, reports that China’s coal plants under construction, plus shuttered ones recently reopened and new ones planned, put it on track to make that impossible. Says GEM’s Christine Shearer: “China’s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris Agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach, even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.”</p>
      <p>As of July, China had 4,436 operating coal plants, with 487 under construction and many more in the permitting pipeline. Contrast that with 1,291 operating US coal plants, with only <i>closings</i> planned.</p>
      <p>The US switch from coal to natural gas leaves it, as of 2018, with “the largest absolute decline [in carbon emissions] among all countries since 2000,” according to the IEA. Call it the difference between talking and actually walking green.</p>
