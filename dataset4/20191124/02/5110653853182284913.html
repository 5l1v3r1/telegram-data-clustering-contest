      <h1>NXT TakeOver: WarGames 2019 results: Tommaso Ciampa pins champion Adam Cole after insane fall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:50:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:50</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Fritz</a></address>
      <p>The saying in WWE is "don't do this at home". That is definitely the case when it comes to the end of NXT TakeOver: WarGames.</p>
      <p>The main event was the men's WarGames match pitting The UndisputedEra — Adam Cole,Bobby Fish, Kyle O'Reilly and Roderick Strong — against Tommaso Ciampa,Keith Lee,Dominik Dijakovic and a mystery partner that turned out to be Kevin Owens. The final few minutes saw Ciampa and Cole fighting on the top of the steel cage and Ciampa getting Cole on his back and diving off as the two fell at least 15 feet down through two tables in a spectacular stunt. Ciampa then rolled over and pinned the NXT champion to win the match.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The show began with the first-ever women's WarGames match that saw Rhea Ripley and Candice LeRae overcome the odds to get the win in a fantastic match. The big moment happened outside the cage when Dakota Kai — a last minute replacement for Mia Yim — turned on her own opponent Tegan Nox. That left Ripley and LeRae alone to fight the four members of Team Baszler but they were able to survive with Ripley pinning the champion Baszler, likely setting up a future match between them.</p>

      <p><b>8:21 p.m.:</b> Riddle goes for submission moves early on and now Balor is trying to control the pace with a headlock. All mat wrestling so far in this one.</p>

        <b>8:12 p.m. FINISH: Priest is down in the middle of the ring and Dunne is on Dain's back with a sleeper hold. Dain drops down onto Priest and slides off with Dunne making the cover and getting the win. A lot going on there - maybe too much? - but some incredible action between those three. And it will be Pete Dunne vs. Adam Cole for the NXT championship Sunday night at Survivor Series.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>8:10 p.m.:</b> Every time it looks like someone is going to score a pin, it gets broken up at the last second. PDain climbs to the top rope, only to get kicked in the head by Dunne. All three of them are on the top rope and Dunne snaps Priest's fingers and then superplexes Dain. He hits Priest with the Bitter End but Dain breaks it up again.</p>

      <p><b>7:59 p.m.:</b> Priest comes off the top ropes and drops both Dain and Dunne. He hits Dunne with a chokeslam and almost gets the pin. They both go outside the ring and Priest gives Dunne the Razor's Edge onto the announce's table. Then Dain flies from the ring onto Priest and follows that up with a cannonball into the guard rail.</p>

      <p><b>7:52 p.m.:</b> These guys are going at it fast and furious including Dain dropping Priest with a running crossbody and then dropping Dunne down hard across Priest's face. They go outside the ring and Dain has then both on his back and he delivers a fall-away slam.</p>

      <p>
        <b>7:43 p.m. FINISH: Baszler has Ripley in a rear choke and she almos passes out but instead takes the open end of the handcuff attached to her wrist (remember the handcuffs?) and puts it on Baszler. Ripley then nails her with several knees to the face and then hits a pump-handle slam onto chairs to get the win. One heckuva match and a great start to this show. The women totally stepped out and knocked it out of the park.</b>

      <p><b>7:40 p.m.:</b> Shirai goes to the top of the cage and LaRae follows her up. Ray follows too but LaRae puts her down with an Avanlanche Poisonrada! What the what?! And the Shirai with a moonsault OFF THE TOP OF THE CAGE!!!</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>7:36 p.m.:</b> Both Ripley and Baszler are going for submissions on their opponents but can't get the tap. Ripley and LaRae are not getting pummeled including Belair whipping Ripley with her hair.</p>
      <p><b>7:34 p.m.:</b> Baszler tries to handcuff Ripley to the ropes but can't get her there. Ripley and LeRae are surrounded but they're up to the fight. LeRae fights off opponents with a trash can lid and Ripley suplexes Ray into the cage.</p>
      <p><b>7:30 p.m.:</b> Time for Shayna Baszler to enter the match and she is giddy with the 4-on-2 advantage her team has. The officials have just said the match is officially started despite Kai not being in the match and Nox being injured. The odds are stacked against Team Ripley.</p>
      <p><b>7:27 p.m.:</b> Dakota Kai is next up but before she turns on Tegan Nox! She viciously attacked Nox in the standby cage, smashing her face first into the cage and then going after her bad knees. General manager WIlliam Regal is trying to stop her and now she is finally going tothe back. That means Team Ripley has only two people in the match.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>7:25 p.m.:</b> Big spot at Ripley with a Tower of Doom onto a pile of chairs. And then Belair comes off the top with a 450splash.</p>
      <p><b>7:23</b> Belair gets slammed face-first onto a garbage can and almost gets suplexed onto four chair. Next person up and it's Kay Lee Ray who is bashing her opponents with a chair.</p>
      <p><b>7:21 p.m.:</b> Here comes Rhea Ripley and she's bringing the toys as she tosses trash cans, canes, and chairs into the ring. Danger danger.</p>
      <p><b>7:18 p.m.</b> : Five minutes have gone by and Bianca Belair joins the action, giving her and Shirai a 2-on-1 advantage for three minutes. LeRae tried to hold them off but Belair is too strong.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>7:15 p.m.:</b> LaRae tried to dive from one ring to the other but Shirai caught her with a big forearm and followed that up with two 619's to the back of LaRae's head and a missile drop kick.</p>
      <p><b>7:11 p.m.:</b> Io Shirai and Candice LeRae will start things off. They'll go at it for five minutes alone and they immediately tear into one another exchanging punching.</p>
      <p><b>7:05 p.m.:</b> And we start off with war!!! The first-ever women's WarGames match kicks off the main card. The rules are that two teams will be contained in separate cages. One person from each team goes into the cage. After five minutes, someone from Team Baszler will join the action. Then a member from Team Ripley can enter three minutes later. They alternate entrants in three minute intervals until all eight women are in the cage and that is when the match officially begins.If someone leaves the cage, they are disqualified. The first time to score a pin or force someone to submit wins.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>6:59 p.m.:</b> Pat McAfee and his jorts have hijacked the final moments of the kickoff show as he cut a promo hyping the show including him running in the crowd. Sure.</p>
      <p><b>6:55 p.m.:</b> Well, we have our answer for one of the spots as Dakota Kai has been picked to the open spot on Team Ripley. It look a little convincing by Rhea Ripley but Kai is in.</p>
      <p><b>6:51 p.m:</b> There are now two open spots for the WarGames matches as someone has to replace Mia Yim and Team Ciampa still hasn't announced its final member. My guesses would be either Dakota Kai or Toni Storm in the women's match and maybe Kevin Owens for the men? That would be a big deal.</p>
      <h3>Angel Garza defeats Isaiah "Swerve" Scott </h3>
      <p>
        <b>6:45 p.m. FINISH: Garza goes for a low blow but Scott catches his foot.  He goes for a kick but Garza catches his leg, connects with a knee to the face and hits Wingclipper for the win. Good match but a bit short. Both of these guys are going places, especially Garza who has major star written all over him with his looks and appeal to the Hispanic market.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>6:43 p.m.:</b> After Garza was in control, Scott comes back with a Death Valler Driver on the apron and then double knees from the apron that floors Garza.</p>
      <p><b>6:41 p.m.:</b> Nice stuff early including Garza pulling off his long trunks and throwing them in Scott's face before connecting with a superkick.</p>
