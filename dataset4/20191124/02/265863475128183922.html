      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, Damon Dash just got out of jail and he celebrated his exit from the institution while at a party on the Lower East Side. This past Wednesday, Damon was arrested by authorities for failing to make child support payments, however, not long after, he hosted a party at the Canary Club.</p>
      <p>The star introduced a new band there called “Billy Pablo The Third,” and stated they were the “Black Guns.” Damon stated before the audience that he brought his entire crew up from Los Angeles and hadn’t been in that area for six years.</p>

      <p>Reportedly, Dash and his band performed from 9:30 pm until around 1:00 am, and the outlet stated that he was drinking vodka sodas the entire night. As it was previously reported, the co-founder of Roc-A-Fella records was accused of owing nearly half-a-million dollars to two different women.</p>
      <p>The business mogul filed legal documents this past week stating he didn’t have any money. Joseph Fucito, the NYC Sheriff, revealed they had been trying to arrest him since 2015, four years ago. Outside of the court, Dash stated he didn’t have any money problems, and he had already paid the amount he owed.</p>
      <p>“No more warrants, everything is clear,” the Roc-A-Fella co-founder added. Reported by TMZ back in the final week of September, the outlet stated that Damon Dash didn’t want to pay any more money to his ex-wife, Rachel Roy.</p>
      <p>Damon reportedly tried to have the judge toss out his child support obligations. Mr. Dash claimed he no longer wanted to pay for his 19-year-old child girl with Rachel, Ava. Initially, Dash agreed to pay $6,000 per month for both children, however, the obligation supposedly didn’t stop at 18-years-old.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that Dash didn’t have the money to support the payments, and in 2018, he only made $56,000. Additionally, Damon claims his ex-wife makes around $500,000 per year and lives a very luxurious lifestyle all over the world, including trips to India, Greece, and Europe. According to Dash, via TMZ, he pays around $3,666 per month for their 11-year-old’s private education.</p>
