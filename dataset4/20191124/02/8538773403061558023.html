      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</a> have discussed shutting down <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford">Matthew Stafford</a> for the season because of his back injury, but that is not what the quarterback wants, and he still is hoping to play again this year, sources told ESPN.</p>
      <p>Not only does Stafford want to play, but he is, in the words of one source, "maniacal" about it.</p>
      <p>However, if the Lions cannot turn around their season and string together some victories, the safest approach might be to rest Stafford for an injury that doctors have told him would sideline most players six weeks.</p>
      <p>Stafford is missing his third straight game Sunday against the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574630/jeff-driskel">Jeff Driskel</a> filling in once again for him.</p>
      <p>With the fractures in Stafford's back, surgery is not considered an option. The injuries are potentially chronic, and Stafford knows that the pain -- which he has dealt with dating back to last season -- could be an issue for him for years to come.</p>
      <p>But Stafford still wants to return to play this season, despite knowing the risks involved.</p>
      <p>It's unlikely he will be able to return in time for the Lions' Thanksgiving Day game against the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a>, but nobody is ready to rule Stafford out just yet.</p>
