      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Pakistani handmade furniture products have great potential to capture world market with excellent modern designing, said Punjab Governor Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the 11th Interiors Pakistan exhibition held at Expo Centre Lahore, he said that Pakistan was moving forward and was in a better position to attract foreign investment. He appreciated the Pakistan Furniture Council (PFC) for creating opportunities for investment in the country by creating business-to-business contacts with foreign furniture producers.</p>
      <p>He said the government would fully support the furniture industry to exploit its potential for boosting production and maximising exports worldwide. Sarwar further said that the PTI government aimed to establish strong liaison with this particular sector for thorough understanding of the market conditions and requirements of the industry.</p>
      <p>“The PTI will direct the concerned authorities to provide more visible support to the furniture business in terms of simple and easily obtainable grants,” he announced. “This will help the sector to exhibit and attend trade shows and also promote local exports as a success globally.”</p>
      <p>Also speaking on the occasion, PFC Chief Executive Mian Kashif Ashfaq said that if the government makes policies according to the suggestions of the sector’s stakeholders it would offer huge opportunities for furniture exporters.</p>
