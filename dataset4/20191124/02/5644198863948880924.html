      <p>Canada beat Russia in the first semi-final in Madrid's Caja Magica on Saturday, with Britain up against Spain later.</p>
      <p>Serbia were beaten in the quarter-finals by Russia on Friday after Novak Djokovic and Viktor Troicki squandered three match points in the deciding doubles rubber. Afterwards the Serbian captain Nenad Zimonjic and his players were in tears.</p>
      <p>Ten-time champions France, runners-up in 2018, bowed out in the group stage.</p>
      <p>The wildcards were decided by the Davis Cup Steering Committee. The draw for the qualifying round, which will be played at "home" venues, takes place on Sunday.</p>
