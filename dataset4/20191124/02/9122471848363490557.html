      <h1>Urban Meyer Has Heartfelt Message For Buckeye Nation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:02:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Today was a pretty special day in Columbus. The eyes of college football turned on the city ahead of this weekend’s biggest game, Ohio State vs. Penn State. It also featured the return of a few notable former Buckeyes, including national championship-winning head coach Urban Meyer, who is in his first year as an analyst for FOX.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>College GameDay</i> was on hand to preview the game. Former Buckeye Kirk Herbstreit said that Ohio State fans made it an <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/kirk-herbstreit-ohio-state-fans-college-gameday-columbus">incredible atmosphere for the show</a>.</p>
      <p>Columbus also played host to FOX’s big new pregame show. Before the network’s “Big Noon Saturday” presentation of the game, Meyer and company previewed the game. He had a message for Buckeye fans very similar to Herbstreit’s.</p>

      <p>After the game, Urban Meyer <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/urban-meyer-ohio-state-penn-state-chase-young-heisman">shared his thoughts on the game</a>, and stumped for Chase Young’s burgeoning Heisman candidacy. The star defensive end had three huge sacks in his return from the controversial two-game suspension stemming from a loan he received from a family friend to fly his girlfriend to last year’s Rose Bowl.</p>
      <p>Ohio State went up 21-0 early in the first quarter tonight.</p>
      <p>Penn State did well to take advantage of mistakes by Justin Fields and J.K. Dobbins, scoring touchdowns off of Ohio State fumbles. Eventually, PSU had cut things to 21-17.</p>
      <p>Young and his defensive teammates got to work and helped shut the door on Will Levis and the Nittany Lions offense, while Fields hit Chris Olave on a beautiful final touchdown to make things more comfortable. I’m sure the 100,000+ roaring fans at The Shoe didn’t hurt either, when the team needed their presence most.</p>
