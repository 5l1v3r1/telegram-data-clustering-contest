        <b>Every week throughout the year, Sporting Life will pick out five highlights so you never miss a beat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our writers will provide all of the key information such as TV channels and kick-off times, plus the latest odds from Sky Bet and, finally, their own unmissable verdict.</p>
      <p>We continue with five sporting highlights for the week ahead.</p>
      <h3>Racing - Ladbrokes Winter Festival</h3>
      <p><b>When</b>: Friday &amp; Saturday</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: Newbury</p>
      <p><b>TV:</b> ITV &amp; Racing TV</p>
      <p>The two-day Ladbrokes Winter Festival features in the world of racing this week with the £250,000 Ladbrokes Trophy on Saturday afternoon one of the crown jewels of the National Hunt season.</p>
      <p>Won by some of the game's greats over the years, including One Man, Denman (twice), Bobs Worth and more recently the likes of Native River, the three miles, two furlong handicap formerly known at the Hennessy Gold Cup is always a fiercely competitive contest.</p>
      <p>The race has been won by nine horses which have also won the Cheltenham Gold Cup, while 2014 hero Many Clouds went on to claim the Grand National the following spring.</p>
      <p>This season popular second-season chaser Ok Corral looks likely to figure prominently for local trainer Nicky Henderson, while champion Irish trainer Willie Mullins is set to bring over rapidly improving mare Cabaret Queen.</p>
      <p>The pick of Friday's Winter Festival action see last year's Stayers' Hurdle hero Paisley Park back to defend his crown in the Long Distance Hurdle, a race in which he'll face off with former winners Unowhatimeanharry and Thistlecrack.</p>
      <h3>Snooker - UK Championship</h3>
      <p><b>When</b>: Tuesday onwards</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: York Barbican</p>
      <p><b>TV</b>: BBC &amp; Eurosport</p>
      <p>Ronnie O'Sullivan will return to York bidding to win the Betway UK Championship for a third year in a row.</p>
      <p>O'Sullivan lifted the UK Championship trophy aloft for a record seventh time when beating Mark Allen 10-6 in last year's final and is one of the leading fancies again ahead of his quest for an eighth win in this event.</p>
      <p>Standing in his way will be reigning world champion Judd Trump, sure to be full of confidence having rounded off a remarkable run of three finals in as many weeks when beating O'Sullivan to claim the Northern Ireland Open recently.</p>
      <p>Other big names to note are Mark Selby and Neil Robertson, dual winners of this event who have both been in winning form this season, while veteran Jimmy White is also in the draw, the <i>Whirlwind</i> set to face Mark Allen in round one.</p>
      <h3>F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</h3>
      <p><b>When</b>: Sunday</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi</p>
      <p><b>TV</b>: Sky Sports F1</p>
      <p>The latest F1 season comes to an end in Abu Dhabi, where Lewis Hamilton will look to cap another championship-winning year with his fifth victory in the race.</p>
      <p>Hamilton won in 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2018, and it’s now six years since anyone other than a Mercedes driver took the chequered flag in the final grand prix on the calendar.</p>
      <p>If that’s to change it’ll be down to either Ferrari or Max Verstappen – at least according to the odds – but watch out for Alex Albon after his luckless finish to the Brazilian Grand Prix last time out.</p>
      <p>As ever, race weekend begins with two practice sessions on Friday, before Saturday’s third session, which is followed by qualifying, and then the race itself on Sunday.</p>
      <h3>Football - UEFA Champions League</h3>
      <p><b>When</b>: Tuesday &amp; Wednesday</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: Europe</p>
      <p><b>TV</b>: BT Sport</p>
      <p>The Champions League group stages will come to a close in the middle of December and there are some cracking clashes to look forward to this week.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday Juventus play host to Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid take on Paris Saint-Germain in the Spanish capital, while the following night Barcelona play Dortmund and Liverpool take on Napoli at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The other Premier League sides in action - namely Man City, Spurs and Chelsea - face Shakhtar Donetsk (h), Olympiakos (h) and Valencia (a) respectively.</p>
      <p>All four still hold strong claims of progressing to the knockout stages, but Chelsea's Group H is a tight one with Ajax, the Blues and Valencia all on seven points after four games so there's all to play for at the Mestalla Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Cricket - New Zealand v England 2nd Test</h3>
      <p><b>When</b>: Thursday-Monday</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: Hamilton, New Zealand</p>
      <p><b>TV</b>: Sky Sports Cricket</p>
      <p>Having been outplayed in the First Test of this two-match series at the Bay Oval, England head to Hamilton under pressure and in need of a reaction.</p>
      <p>New Zealand, driven by a brilliant double-hundred from BJ Watling in the series opener, should again prove a tough nut to crack on home soil but England will be hoping the likes of Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad can bounce back having struggled badly in the first Test.</p>
      <p>With Rory Burns suffering a split finger in that match, watch out to see if highly-touted Kent batsman Zac Crawley makes his Test debut for England while the Kiwis still have the express pace of Lockie Ferguson up their sleeve if they feel the need to freshen up their impressive bowling attack.</p>
      <p>New head coach Chris Silverwood will be desperate not to begin his tenure with a series defeat so there really is everything to play for.</p>
