        <b>Felipe Caicedo snatched a late winner to keep Lazio third in Serie A with a 2-1 victory over Sassuolo on Sunday, as England defender Chris Smalling scored and set up two other goals for city rivals Roma in a win against Brescia to move fourth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Champions Juventus maintained their grip on the top of Serie A with a 3-1 win at Atalanta on Saturday, to stay one point ahead of Inter Milan who eased past Torino 3-0 under the rain in Turin.</p>
      <p>The two Roman outfits are now third and fourth respectively before Cagliari, a point behind in fifth, play at lowly Lecce on Monday after their game Sunday was washed out.</p>
      <p>"It's an important success," said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi.</p>
      <p>"Third place consolidated? It's still early, we are there and the others too, every day things can change."</p>
      <p>Serie A top-scorer Ciro Immobile struck to put Lazio ahead on 34 minutes with his 15th league goal this season.</p>
      <p>But struggling Sassuolo pulled a goal back through Francesco Caputo just before the break.</p>
      <p>Ecuadorian Caicedo came off the bench to seal a fifth consecutive league win in injury time to keep Lazio seven points behind Inter Milan in third place.</p>
      <p>Roma are now two points behind their local rivals after Smalling sparked their 3-0 win over bottom club Brescia.</p>
      <p>Smalling, on loan from Manchester United, headed in the first from a corner in the 48th minute at the Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old then provided the cross that allowed fellow defender Gianluca Mancini to volley in eight minutes later, with Edin Dzeko completing the rout on 66 minutes after Smalling's headed assist.</p>
      <p>"Long may this continue," said Smalling. "Because we've got some big ambitions this season and we need to keep improving each game.</p>
      <p>"I'm enjoying my football and I think the team, as you can see, is enjoying our football too. We need to keep going because there is a long way to go yet."</p>
      <p>Roma coach Paulo Fonseca praised the former Fulham player after his second league goal this season and hinted he might remain beyond this season.</p>
      <p>"He's fine here, he's a very nice player and I think he wants to stay with us," said the Portuguese coach.</p>
      <h3>Lecce washout</h3>
      <p>Brescia, now coached by 2006 World Cup winner Fabio Grosso, remain rooted to the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Italy forward Mario Balotelli was dropped for Sunday's game because of his lack of commitment in training.</p>
      <p>And Grosso insisted he would not take back the 29-year-old back until he changed his attitude as the promoted side fight for top-flight survival.</p>
      <p>"Mario can be a protagonist in this team if he has the will, the determination and the enthusiasm, which he has so often lacked," said Grosso.</p>
      <p>"When you are at the bottom of the table like us you need more than a player who knows how to hit the ball hard and score when he can.</p>
      <p>"We need someone ready to work for the team, fight hard for the 90 minutes."</p>
      <p>Samuel Di Carmine scored the only goal as Verona piled the pressure on Fiorentina, despite Franck Ribery returning after his three-match suspension.</p>
      <p>The Tuscany side are in 10th place with just one point from their last three games.</p>
      <p>Claudio Ranieri's Sampdoria moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 comeback win over 10-man Udinese.</p>
      <p>A Manolo Gabbiadini free-kick before the break and a 75th-minute Gaston Ramirez penalty gave the Genoa side their third win of the season.</p>
      <p>Ilija Nestorovski had put Udinese ahead before the half hour but the north-easterners played the final 40 minutes a man down after Jakub Jankto was sent off for a second yellow card.</p>
      <p>Sampdoria move up to 16th, three points above the relegation zone, with Udinese just two points ahead in 13th.</p>
      <p>Sunday's late match between Lecce and Cagliari was postponed because of heavy rain in the heel of Italy.</p>
      <p>The match will now be played on Monday at 1400GMT, although weather forecasts remain poor for the Puglia region.</p>
