      <p>Harry Kane has revealed Tottenham’s players went to Mauricio Pochettino’s house to console him after he was sacked last week.</p>
      <p>The England captain also admitted he has been gagged by the club from explaining how he found out about the bombshell news last Monday night.</p>
      <p>Kane, who scored the third goal in his club’s 3-2 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday, said: “They’ve asked me not to talk about it.”</p>
      <p>But he added: “I went round his house and caught up with him the next day.</p>
      <p>“It was a shock for everyone, so I wanted to go and see him and we had a chat for a couple of hours and it was nice to do that before the new manager came in.”</p>
      <p>Team-mate Eric Dier added: “We found out that night [through the club]. And obviously it was quite emotional.</p>

      <p>“It was important for everyone to be able to go to see him. I spoke with him and it was good to be able to do that.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino spent five and a half years Spurs during which time Kane became <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ’s main striker and replaced Wayne Rooney as England’s no.1.</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s been a week I’ve never really had in my career before. A big</p>
      <p>shock on Tuesday night for everyone, the players included.</p>
      <p>“Then it was a quick turnaround - all of a sudden we got a new manager, one of the best managers there has been in the game.</p>

      <p>“So you have to automatically have to turn your head towards that and focus on the game. Obviously, a lot of emotion, a lot of energy, but since the gaffer came in it was all about: ‘Just prepare for Saturday, get yourselves ready, you don’t have to impress me on days one and two, just run about and waste your energy.’</p>
      <p>“So it was about going out there and performing and thankfully we got the win.”</p>
