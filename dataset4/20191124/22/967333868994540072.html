      <p>The 24-hour sympathy strike is set to begin at 3:00 a.m. local time (01:00 GMT) and will include Aviation Workers Union (IAU), Public and Welfare Sector and Transport Workers’ Union among others, according to Finnish public broadcaster YLE.</p>
      <p>The strikes were announced after representatives of postal and logistical workers and state-owned employer Service Sector Employers (Palta) failed to reach an agreement on new employment terms following a protracted negotiating session on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Finnish Post and Logistics Union has been on strike since 11 November in opposition to Palta efforts to transfer them from one legal entity to another, a move which union members say will slash their salaries and limit the union’s leverage.</p>
      <p>Finnish flag carrier Finnair announced the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201808031066913236-finnish-activist-detained-flight-delay/">cancellation of 250 flights</a> in connection with the IAU-member workers going on the sympathy strike, affecting up to 20,000 passengers.</p>
      <p>In addition, Finnish Seafarers Union (SMU) announcement of a strike on Monday could see a breakdown in maritime trade and commute between Finland and its neighbours, namely Sweden and Estonia. Business organisation Confederation of Finnish Industries has estimated that up to a third of Finland’s foreign trade could be slashed in connection with the SMU strike, English-language newspaper Helsinki Times reported.</p>
      <p>The PAU strike on behalf of 700 parcel-sorting employees is set to last into December and has already resulted in delays of weeks in delivery of mail and parcels, according to YLE.</p>
