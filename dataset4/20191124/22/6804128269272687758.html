      <p>Roy Hodgson has revealed that Andros Townsend has been fighting injury this season on his way back to form.</p>
      <p>The former Tottenham winger struggled to find his way into the Eagles boss' plans in the early stages of the Premier League has now started consecutive matches against Chelsea and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Townsend put in an <a href="https://www.football.london/crystal-palace-fc/crystal-palace-liverpool-player-ratings-17306062">impressive display</a> against Andrew Robertson in a valiant Palace display as he looked to drive forward with the ball, but also ensured one of Liverpool's stars was unable to progress up the pitch as frequently as usual.</p>
      <p>Hodgson was pleased to see the performance but admitted it will be difficult for the 28-year-old with a busy festive period ahead.</p>
      <p>He said: "Andros is one of those players who has a very busy style of play. Today it was a busy style of play that produced result as well. He does seem to be coming back to the sort of form we expect from him.</p>
      <p>"He is battling a little bit with an injury situation which I think did impact him in the early part of the season when he wasn't playing well. He is still fighting that one, we were able to luckily this two week break that we had to give him a week to stay off the training field and to try and get some recovery there. I think we saw the benefits of that today.</p>
      <p>"He's going to have to be careful going forward because the type of strain that he is playing through won't go away with all the games we have to play but I'm fortunate in that respect in that the one area of the field where I think there are good opportunities to make changes and have players who can come in is the middle of the field."</p>
