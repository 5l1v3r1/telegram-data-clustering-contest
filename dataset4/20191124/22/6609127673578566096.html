        <b>THE dad of slain Arlene Fraser revealed he would accept her killer hubby being freed — if he finally disclosed where his daughter’s body was dumped.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hector McInnes, 79, made the claim as he urged closure from son-in-law Nat Fraser, 60, over the 1998 murder.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2566324/murdered-arlene-fraser-dad-accepts-never-finding-out/">grieving parent,</a> of Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, said: “It would be a deal with the devil but it would be worth it.”</p>
      <p>Hector also told how he fears that time is running out for him to find out his murdered girl’s last resting place.</p>
      <p>He is hopeful a new law could force <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/3163270/arlene-fraser-murder-nat-fraser-tv-documentary-a-killers-mistake/">evil Fraser</a>, 60, to admit to what he did with his wife’s body if he ever wants to be considered for release from jail.</p>
      <p>But with the brute not eligible for parole for 11 years, Hector said: “I’ll be long gone by then.</p>

      <p>“However, it’s really important to the family that we know where Arlene’s remains are.</p>
      <p>“This new legislation sounds really important — like it could be a big change for us.</p>
      <p>“I would even accept Fraser’s release from prison if he told us what happened to her.”</p>
      <p>Explaining how he would feel if that ever happened, the great-grandad said: “I would be living my life again.</p>
      <p>"It would be a bit better than it is now because I would know where Arlene is.”</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2568893/who-is-arlene-fraser-murder-nat-fraser-1998/">daughter</a> was 33 when she was last seen in April 1998 at home in Elgin, Moray, as she waved kids Jamie and Natalie, then ten and five, off to school.</p>
      <p>Fraser has since been convicted of her murder at two separate trials. It’s claimed he paid a hitman £15,000 to kill Arlene.</p>
      <p>The mystery of where her body was dumped is one of the cases that led to Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf revealing plans last week for Suzanne’s Law.</p>

      <p>The parole reform would keep killers locked up for as long as they keep their secrets.</p>
      <p>It was named after Suzanne Pilley, 38, of Edinburgh, who was murdered in 2010 by ex David Gilroy, 56. He has refused to say where he left her remains.</p>
      <p>But Hector believes <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/1525613/nat-fraser-mum-soup-hmp-addiewell/">Fraser</a> may now be too used to life behind bars to jump at any chance of securing his freedom.</p>
      <p>He said: “He’s probably resigned himself to a cushy life in prison. He’ll be institutionalised.</p>

      <p>“He’ll be into a routine and probably accepts it and thinks he’s better off where he is.”</p>
      <p>Hector said he and the family got some comfort from holding a church service for Arlene five years after she vanished.</p>
      <p>But he admitted she is never far from their thoughts, saying: “We’ve had more than 20 years of this. It’s always with us.</p>
      <p>“One good thing, I suppose, is that we can’t be hurt any more.”</p>
      <p>Fraser was first caged for Arlene’s murder in 2003.</p>
      <p>That conviction was quashed on appeal but he was convicted following a second trial in 2012 and jailed for at least 17 years.</p>
      <p>He had six months added to his sentence last year for using a mobile phone in his cell at Addiewell nick, West Lothian.</p>
