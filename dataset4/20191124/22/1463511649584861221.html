      <p>Kano Pillars Football Club remained in the bottom of the table ‎in the Nigeria Professional Football League after they were held to a 0-0 draw by visiting Wikki tourists FC of Bauchi.‎</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria ‎reports that the draw was in a Match Day 5 fixture and was played at the Sani Abacha Stadium located in Kano metropolis.</p>
      <p>The host looked more determined to gain a win and they put up a good performance throughout the game but were not able to make it.</p>
      <p>Kano Pillars made two changes in the second half and every effort to score proved abortive as the visitors defended tenaciously. </p>
      <p>After the match, Pillars Coach, Ibrahim Musa said that his side played very well but could not score.</p>
      <p>He said that they would put up more effort in order to win their away match against Plateau United‎.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria reports that Pillars were asked to play three home games behind closed doors by LMC following disturbances against Enugu Rangers in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The management of the club also gave three match ultimatum to the technical crew of the club last week after loosing at home to Lobi stars.</p>
      <p>After the ultimatum, Pillars lost 1-0 to Jigawa Golden Stars and played goalless draw with Wikki Tourists.</p>
      <p>Pillars, who now ‎have two points from three matches played so far and occupy 17th position in the league table, will play against Plateau United next weekend in Plateau.</p>
