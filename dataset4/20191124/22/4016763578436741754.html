      <h1>Phoebe Bridgers Covers Tom Waits’ Song About The 1997 Murder Of “Georgia Lee”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:07:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p>Ahead of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/tom-waits">Tom Waits</a>’s 70th birthday, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/the-del-fuegos">The Del Fuegos</a>’ <a href="https://genius.com/artists/warren-zanes">Warren Zanes</a> produced a compilation of cover songs, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Various-artists/Come-on-up-to-the-house-women-sing-waits">Come On Up To The House: Women Sing Waits</a></i>—and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/phoebe-bridgers">Phoebe Bridgers</a> put her own spin on <a href="https://genius.com/Tom-waits-georgia-lee-lyrics">“Georgia Lee.”</a></p>
      <p>The 1999 track is about the 1997 murder of a 12-year-old black girl named Georgia Lee Moses. After she disappeared from her Santa Rosa, Calif. home, her body was found by a freeway on-ramp nine days later. The case remains unsolved.</p>
      <p>The opening lines recount this scene:</p>
      <blockquote>Cold was the night, hard was the ground<br/>They found her in a small grove of trees<br/>Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found<br/>She’s too young to be out on the street</blockquote>
      <p>Waits, a father of three, ended up attending her funeral. “A lot of people came and spoke,” he said, according to <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8507191/tom-waits-mule-variations-track-by-track">Billboard</a></i>. “Everybody was wondering, where were the police, where was the deacon, where were the social workers, and where was I and where were you.”</p>
      <p>Bridgers tweeted about how “no one published anything” about her disappearance:</p>

      <p>The <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Tom-waits/Mule-variations">Mule Variations</a></i> artist memorialized Moses, as he sings:</p>
      <blockquote>Why wasn’t God watching?<br/>Why wasn’t God listening?<br/>Why wasn’t God there for Georgia Lee?</blockquote>
      <p>Zanes spoke to <i><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/23/781764291/on-a-tom-waits-covers-album-women-transform-a-classic-catalog">NPR</a></i> about the artistry of Waits’ turn of phrase. “It’s got that line ‘Why wasn’t God watching?’” he said. “And I just think that if you’re a writer and that’s the only line that you write in your entire career, you should be studied in universities.”</p>
