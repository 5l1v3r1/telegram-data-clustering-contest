      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has said that her Vanity Fair cover shoot was a four-letter rebuke to the people who were critical of her decision to transition gender.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old Olympic gold medalist, born Bruce, debuted her new identity in a corset on the cover of the magazine in June 2015.</p>
      <p>She said she had felt it was “extraordinarily important” that she tried to make an impact on social media after coming out as transgender.</p>

      <p>She told her campmates on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! that the image had been a direct message to the “millions” who had said “terrible things” about her.</p>
      <p>She said: “Transitioning and trying to make an impact (on) social media is extraordinarily important.</p>
      <p>“As soon as the cover of Vanity Fair broke, in the next four hours and one minute, it broke the world record for the fastest to one million followers on Twitter.”</p>
      <p>Jenner has six biological children – Burt and Cassandra with first wife Chrystie Scott, Brandon and Brody with second wife Linda Thompson, and Kendall and Kylie with third wife Kris Jenner.</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, 34, said she remembered where she was on the day the cover was published.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big thing,” agreed EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Jenner added: “For me this was a big f*** you to the millions and millions of people out there that had said terrible things about me. And it just came out and it just shocked them.”</p>
      <p>She also explained to Jossa how she had come to transition.</p>
      <p>She said: “Over many, many, years I had a lot (of surgery) but then near the end it went pretty quickly because you can do your face and your chest all at the same time which they did.</p>
      <p>“Actually for guys if they go on oestrogen they will grow boobs OK.</p>
      <p>“And in my case I was on oestrogen back in the 80s and had a little 36/38B and then I met Kris and had them chopped off.”</p>
      <p>She quipped: “I’m so confused in my life.”</p>
      <p>“And then the second time round 25 years later I was back on oestrogen obviously and they came back – some but not much.</p>
      <p>“So I really had to have them done so it is kind of past the point of no return.”</p>
      <p>Jenner also compared Jossa to her daughter Kylie after the soap star bravely took on a Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Later, Jossa said of Jenner: “I love the fact that she talks so openly and she feels like she can trust us and speak to us so openly, and she puts everything into perspective as well.”</p>
      <p>She added that “the amount of strength that woman has is amazing”.</p>
      <p>The latest episode of I’m A Celebrity saw Jossa and Ian Wright face a stomach-churning trial in which they had to clamber through tunnels filled with crickets, worms, toads and spiders.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
