        <b>Following his previous deadlock in passing Brexit through Parliament, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative party have initiated a snap election to be held in December as a last-ditch attempt to gain the support and votes required to pass a renegotiated version of the deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>UK Prime Minister and Conservative party leader Boris Johnson presented the Tory manifesto on 24 November as a snap election in the country closes in. In the manifesto, the party describes not only its plans for Brexit, but also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911241077388570-uk-pm-johnson-launches-conservative-party-manifesto/">addresses a variety of other issues</a> troubling the country as it seeks to exit from the European Union.</p>
      <p>The party manifesto's key points are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tories are planning on <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911231077384030-boris-johnson-roasts-corbyns-decision-to-be-neutral-in-absurd-new-brexit-vote/">passing the Brexit deal</a>, previously negotiated by Johnson through Parliament by Christmas.</li>
        <li>Tories hope to start implementing the deal in January 2020 and finish it in December 2020 without further extending transition period.</li>
        <li>Following a successful Brexit, Tories plan to negotiate a free trade deal not only with Brussels, but also with other countries to cover 80 percent of the nation's overall trade.</li>
        <li>New planned immigration rules will limit the influx of lower-skilled migrants, while favouring skilled professionals, especially doctors.</li>
        <li>EU citizens staying in the UK will be eligible for British benefits only after 5-year period.</li>
        <li>Conservatives are planning to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911241077389843-labours-spending-would-leave-uk-facing-economic-stalingrad-michael-gove-cites-radio-commentator/">invest some £1 billion into the country's social care</a>, employ an additional 50,000 nurses and negotiate long-term social care reform with other parties.</li>
        <li>The Conservatives are planning massive tax cuts worth £23.5 billion (around $30 billion), primarily by raising the threshold for social security contributions.</li>
        <li>Tories will also review taxes on certain business to cut them for retailers, cinemas and pubs.</li>
        <li>Tories plan to increase the tax credit rate threshold to 13 percent to boost private-sector research and development.</li>
        <li>The conservatives seek to impose a Digital Services Tax on international internet companies.</li>
        <li>The manifesto indicates that conservatives <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911241077389214-uk-military-chiefs-clash-over-plans-to-slash-army-lend-aircraft-carrier-to-us--report/">will boost defence spending</a> each year, keeping it above the designated by the NATO member 2 percent of the GDP target.</li>
      </ul>
