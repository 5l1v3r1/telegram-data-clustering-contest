      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/vibe">Vibe</a> announced their plans to take legal action against <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/park-kyung">Park Kyung</a>.</p>
      <p>On November 24, rapper-producer Park Kyung <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/block-bs-park-kyung-throws-shade-at-singers-who-allegedly-manipulated-music-charts">listed six artists</a> whom he claimed were benefiting from music chart manipulation, a list among which there was the male duo Vibe. On November 25, the duo's agency <b>Major Nine</b> alerted media outlets that they "<i>have not yet received any genuine form of apology from the artist in question, despite giving him enough time to apologize through the agency.</i>"</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the company expressed plans to take legal action to "<i>set right the issue that has become a fait accompli</i>," a situation that has resulted in Vibe members allegedly going through an "<i>irreversible defamation and psychological turmoil.</i>"</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Major Nine wrote, "<i>We express deep regret for seeing a rumor spread without ever having confirmed the truth,</i>" and added that if the legal proceedings were to take place, there will not be any room for prior arrangement or settlement.</p>
