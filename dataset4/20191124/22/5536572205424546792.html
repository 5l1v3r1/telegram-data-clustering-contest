      <p>Brad Wheedleton, founder of BobbleHouse Industries, decided to take it upon himself to create a bobble head that has a guy with a laptop and a drumstick that is meant to hit a large trash can near him. As you know, the Astros are accused of signaling their hitters by hitting a trash can in the dug out after someone on the team decodes the opposing team’s catcher’s signs.</p>
