      <h1>Debate only on margin, BJP will win all 15 seats: CM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:21:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dhns" target="_blank">DHNS</a></address>
      <p>Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday said the party would win all the 15 seats and the victory margin of BJP candidates would be the matter of debate in the December 5 Assembly bypolls.</p>
      <p>"With a deep sense of responsibility, I am saying that we will win all the 15 seats. The matter of debate, however, is the difference of votes with which the BJP candidates will win the by-elections," he said at an election rally at Banavasi in Uttara Kannada district.</p>
      <p>Yediyurappa was in Banavasi to campaign for BJP candidate Shivaram Hebbar, who was previously elected from the Congress, but resigned from the Assembly and was subsequently disqualified by then speaker K R Ramesh Kumar.</p>
      <p>After the Supreme Court allowed the disqualified MLAs to contest the bypolls, Hebbar joined the BJP and is contesting from Yellapur.</p>
      <p>Addressing the gathering, Yediyurappa acknowledged the 'sacrifice' of the 17 MLAs whose resignation led to the fall of Congress-JD(S) coalition government in July this year and paved the way for BJP to come to power in the state.</p>
      <p>"If these 17 people had not resigned from the assembly, neither I would have had the opportunity to speak to you as the chief minister, nor Kota Srinivasa Poojary or Govind Karjol would have become ministers," he said.</p>
      <p>"Dejected with the lack of development in their government, they came out (of their parties)," Yediyurappa said. </p>
