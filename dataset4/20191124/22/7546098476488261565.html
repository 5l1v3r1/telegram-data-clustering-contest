      <h1>Why Bank of Queensland shares are in a trading halt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:17:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Bank of Queensland Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Bank+of+Queensland+Limited/?ticker=ASX-BOQ">(ASX: BOQ)</a> share price won’t be going anywhere on Monday after the regional bank requested a trading halt.</p>
      <h3>Why is Bank of Queensland in a trading halt?</h3>
      <p>This morning Bank of Queensland requested a trading halt whilst it prepares to make an announcement in relation to an equity raising comprising an institutional placement and share purchase plan.</p>
      <p>This news won’t come as a surprise to many investors given the bank’s poor performance in FY 2019 and its underwhelming outlook for the year ahead.</p>
      <p>In FY 2019 the regional bank posted cash earnings after tax of $320 million. This was down 14% on the prior corresponding period. In addition to this, it revealed a 300-basis point increase in its cost to income ratio to 50.5% and a 7-basis point increase in loan impairment expense.</p>
      <p>This ultimately led to Bank of Queensland ending the period with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 9.04%, down 27 basis points.</p>
      <h3>FY 2020 expectations.</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, things aren’t expected to get any better in FY 2020.</p>
      <p>The bank’s new managing director &amp; CEO, George Frazis, said: “We expect lower year-on-year cash earnings in FY20 with revenue and impairment outcomes in line with FY19, higher post-Hayne regulatory and compliance costs, and increased operating expenses related to our investment in technology.”</p>
      <p>Unlike <b>Commonwealth Bank of Australia</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Commonwealth+Bank+of+Australia/?ticker=ASX-CBA">(ASX: CBA)</a> and the rest of the big four, Bank of Queensland’s CET1 needs to be above 8.5% to be unquestionably strong.</p>
      <p>Whilst it is over this level at the moment, a poor performance in FY 2020 and unexpected remediation costs could change things very quickly. Hence why it is probably a smart move by the bank to secure additional capital now and strengthen its balance sheet sooner rather than later.</p>
      <h3>What is Bank of Queensland seeking to raise?</h3>
      <p>Bank of Queensland is undertaking a fully underwritten $250 million institutional share placement. This will be followed by a non-underwritten share purchase plan aiming to raise approximately $25 million.</p>
      <p>The final issue price of the placement will be determined by way of a variable price bookbuild across $7.69 – $7.78 per new share. This represents a 10% to 11% discount to its last close price of $8.64.</p>
      <p>Management advised: “The capital raising will be used to strengthen BOQ’s balance sheet, provide an increased buffer above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) “unquestionably strong” Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio benchmark and create additional capacity for BOQ to implement its strategic priorities.”</p>
