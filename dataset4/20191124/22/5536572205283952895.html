      <p>Home cooking is alive and well.</p>
      <p>During the huge game at Gillette Stadium between the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, there was a play in the 1st quarter where the refs called Cowboys’ Tyron Smith for tripping.</p>
      <p>That drive would stall, but upon further inspection, you could see how bad that call was on Smith who never tripped anybody on the play.</p>
