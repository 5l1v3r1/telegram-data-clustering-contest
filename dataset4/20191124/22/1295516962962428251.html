      <p>After <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-showrunner-confirms-michonne-gone-until-later-season-10/">several episodes away</a>, we finally catch up with Michonne in <i>The Walking Dead</i>’s midseason finale, “The World Before.” She’s still <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-michonne-and-ezekiel-kiss/">on her way to Oceanside</a>, along with Judith, Luke and others. Luke suggests they stop at a nearby library. Michonne is against the idea, but then Judith points out she’s read almost every book in Alexandria.</p>
      <p>At the library, Luke goes to check out the music section as Michonne gets a message over her walkie talkie from Alexandria via Hilltop. As Michonne learns about Siddiq's death and Dante's betrayal, Luke is attacked by a couple of walkers in the music section. It’s more than he can handle and he screams for help. However, the person who comes to Luke's aid is unfamiliar. The man takes out one of the walkers and runs away as Luke screams after him.</p>

      <p>After Michonne and her group reach Oceanside, the citizens capture a stranger who they caught trying to steal a sail and, most likely, a boat. Luke recognizes him as the man who saved his life. The man struggles terribly against the people who captured him and explains he just wants to get back to his family. Michonne is suspicious, though, after learning about what happened in Alexandria with Dante -- this man could be be a Whisperer spy too. Before they can get to the bottom of things, the interrogation is interrupted by a herd of walkers.</p>
      <p>In the mayhem, the man goes free and tries to run away. It’s Judith who stops him. She cuts his leg, incapacitating him, kills a walker and then calls for Michonne. Once again Judith shows how remarkably capable she is.</p>

      <p>The man wakes up later to find his wound stitched up and himself bound. Michonne questions him once again. He confesses he’s just trying to get back home. He only left to get supplies. He doesn’t have any other agenda. He resists telling her where he lives, but eventually admits he lives on an island naval base. The only reason he broke into Oceanside was for a boat to get back.</p>
      <p>He and Michonne come to an agreement: she’ll take him home in exchange for weapons from the island. She fills Judith in on what she intends to do, and Judith tells her it’s okay for her to go.</p>

      <p>Once Michonne confirms the deal with the Oceansiders, she prepares to take off with the man, who introduces himself as Virgil. She instructs her people to tell everyone at Alexandria what’s going on. She adds that she’s only a couple days behind them, plus, she can be reached over her walkie whenever anyone needs her.</p>
      <p>She and Virgil than sail across the water to see what weapons Virgil might have that could give the joint communities an advantage against Alpha and the Whisperers. We’ll see what Michonne finds when <i>The Walking Dead</i> returns next year.</p>
