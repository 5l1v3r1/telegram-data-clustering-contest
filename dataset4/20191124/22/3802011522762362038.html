      <p>According to The Citizen, Mayoral spokesperson Omogolo Taunyane said the clip was being used “as a tool to blackmail and extort undue favours from the City of Tshwane”.</p>
      <p>Mokgalapa was quoted as saying: “We have been aware of the existence of this audio recording for a few days and threats to release the recording have been communicated to us via an intermediary wherein certain demands have been made.” <b><a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/da-to-investigate-alleged-tshwane-mayor-sex-clip-37897077">IOL</a></b></p>
