      <p>MINNESOTA -- A 12 year-old Minnesota boy experienced a flood of emotions when he saw color for the first time.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Jones tried on special glasses that allow him to see color after his principal, who is also colorblind, let him borrow them.</p>
      <p>Jones will soon have his own after a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sp7m4-color-blind-glasses">GoFundMe page</a> was created to buy him a pair. The goal was to raise $350 but the page raised over $23,000.</p>
      <p>The leftover funds will be donated to a foundation that purchases colorblind glasses for those who can't afford them.</p>
