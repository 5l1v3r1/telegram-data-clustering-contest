      <p>The I'm A Celebrity camp was embroiled in another massive fight on Sunday night's show - with Ian Wright facing 'bullying' claims.</p>
      <p>A heated argument over 'sexist' decisions descended into chaos when tearful Andrew Maxwell accused shouting Ian Wright of purposefully 'singling him out'.</p>
      <p>It all started with a tense debate over who who should get roast dinners ahead of an upcoming trial - with Kate Garraway confronting James Haskell over "chivalrous nonsense".</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain host snapped back at the camp leader over his insistence that women should always go first before the men.</p>
      <p>As the camp began to clash, comedian Andrew said that he did not like the way former football Ian kept speaking to him.</p>

      <p>Frustrated Andrew, 45, then stood up and said: “You keep shouting at me Ian.”</p>
      <p>Ian, 56, looked at him and asked: “Who is shouting, when did I shout?”</p>
      <p>When Andrew told him it was "just then", Ian claimed: “I wasn’t even talking to you, what did I say?”</p>

      <p>In the Bush Telegraph, Roman Kemp admitted he was a little bit lost and did not understand how the situation had happened.</p>
      <p>Back in camp, Ian told Andrew: "What are you talking about, I didn’t shout at you."</p>
      <p>When Andrew asked why Ian was singling him out, Ian firmly denied that he was and asked the comedian to repeat what he had supposedly said.</p>

      <p>As things got heated, Andrew claimed he could not remember and was tired so walked to his bed.</p>
      <p>Ian was not happy with the situation, but Andrew then walked back to the football pundit and opened his arms to make up.</p>
      <p>Andrew said: “I’m sorry, I’m really tired, I don’t know, I’m really tired."</p>

      <p>When Andrew started to get emotional in front of Ian, the former Arsenal striker said: “Don’t cry.”</p>
      <p>Close to tears, apologetic Andrew confessed: "I’m not going to cry, I’m sorry."</p>
      <p>A tired and emotional Ian and Andrew both hugged each other as they settled their differences.</p>
      <p>“You’re my pal and I’m just really sensitive," admitted Andrew.</p>

      <p>When Ian asked what was up with him, Andrew confessed he was just tired.</p>
      <p>Ian replied: “We both are dude. We’re both hungry, we’re both tired.”</p>
      <p>Andrew said: “I know, I know, I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>They both emotionally hugged each other again and the tension was relieved in camp.</p>
