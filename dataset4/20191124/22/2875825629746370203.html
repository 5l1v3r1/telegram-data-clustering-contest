      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:29:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> saw resident melodrama king Andrew Maxwell find himself in yet another verbal sparring match this evening as tensions rose in camp.</p>
      <p>The comedian found himself facing off against England rugby legend and newly elected Camp Leader James Haskell as camp voted on the answer to a question that could win them a treat.</p>
      <p>As Kate Garraway and Roman Kemp were presented a choice between salted nuts and jelly beans at the Outback Shack, the rest of camp was asked a question that would win them one of the two.</p>
      <p>Kisok Kev rang up camp and asked them: "What percentage of adults do not trust politicians?</p>
      <p>"A - 59% or B - 79%?"</p>

      <p>James called for a show of hands for each, and the camp went for 79%, despite Andrew insisting: "Not everyone put their hands up."</p>
      <p>"They did," James snapped back.</p>
      <p>At that point, Andrew threw another sulk and moaned: "It's just as shambolic as ever. We're not getting chocolate."</p>
      <p>Cliff tried to cheer up the atmosphere by giving his rendition of musical Frozen's iconic track Let It Go.</p>

      <p>Speaking in the Bus Telegraph, James confided: "Everyone's tired, everyone's a bit chippy.</p>
      <p>"Everyone's had a long day, everyone's had a long day. Things happen.</p>
      <p>"I'm just mortified if [Andrew] think I just closed him down."</p>

      <p>The pair cleared the air during a face to face confrontation, and hugged it out.</p>
      <p>"I said my piece," Andrew said in the Bush Telegraph, "Everyone said their piece and big James gave me a hug. Job done."</p>
      <p>Roman and Kate humbled Andrew further when they came back with the bowl of jelly beans.</p>

      <p>"Thank God for Adele," he said, "Thank God people didn't listen to me."</p>
      <p>He also clashed with Ian Wright as he accused the former footballer of shouting at him.</p>
      <p>Roman confessed he was confused by the whole situation and why the pair were snapping at eachother.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry," he told Ian after, "I'm really tired. I'm sorry. I don't know."</p>
      <p>They gave each other a squeeze as Ian threatened he might shed some more tears.</p>
      <p>Tonight's episode also saw Jacqueline Jossa squeal with delight as Caitlyn Jenner compared her to her daughter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> .</p>
      <p>"So how cool is that?" she gushed, "Caitlyn Jenner just casually said, 'Oh, you remind me of Kylie.'</p>
      <p>"Winning."</p>
