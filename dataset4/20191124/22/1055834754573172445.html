      <p><a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Nintendo">Nintendo</a> is constantly experimenting with hardware. If they are not coming up with wacky things for their consoles, the company is experimenting with accessories and peripherals. Some of them make it to the market, but some do not. The latter is the focus for a new video by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Liam+Robertson">Liam Robertson</a>, which was published on the Did You Know Gaming? YouTube channel. You can see their official tweet down below.</p>
