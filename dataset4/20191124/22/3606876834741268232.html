        <b>A curse hanging over success-starved South African giants Kaizer Chiefs continued Sunday when a Judas Moseamedi brace gave outsiders Maritzburg United a 2-1 League Cup semi-final victory.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Moseamedi punished a Daniel Cardoso blunder to score on 30 minutes and after Yagan Sasman levelled 12 minutes from time, the Maritzburg forward struck the 84th-minute winner in Nelspruit.</p>
      <p>Soweto-based Chiefs, whose nationwide popularity enables them to draw 90,000 crowds, have not lifted a trophy since being crowned 2015 league champions.</p>
      <p>Since then there have been 19 league and cup competitions over five seasons, none of which Chiefs won.</p>
      <p>The 2015 championship triumph was the 53rd in domestic competitions since Chiefs were formed in 1970 and they also lifted the now defunct African Cup Winners Cup 18 years ago.</p>
      <p>Chiefs' German coach Ernst Middendorp felt the 2019/2020 league leaders may have underrated mid-table Maritzburg and were thinking of a final against arch rivals Mamelodi Sundowns.</p>
      <p>"I warned my players not to underestimate Maritzburg, but I think some of them were already looking forward to a showdown next month with Sundowns," he said.</p>
      <p>"Maritzburg deserved to win and we had defensive issues, even when we outnumbered our opponents three to one in some situations."</p>
      <p>United coach and former national star Eric Tinkler said he was thrilled by the victory but disappointed at the scoreline in conditions so hot that there was a water break in each half.</p>
      <p>"Chiefs were there for the taking and we should have slaughtered them. A victory by five or six goals would not have flattered us.</p>
      <p>"Now we face Sundowns and I have told my players that if they want to be the best they have to beat the best."</p>
      <p>On Saturday in Durban Sundowns survived a late Golden Arrows rally and having Uruguayan Gaston Sirino sent off for a deliberate stamp to win 2-1 and reach the December 14 final.</p>
