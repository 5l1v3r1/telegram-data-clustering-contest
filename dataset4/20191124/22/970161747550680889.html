      <p>Leaked files have revealed how China ‘systematically brainwashes’ Muslims in various high-security prison camps.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government has detained more than a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities – but repeatedly claimed the facilities are for ‘voluntary job training’.</p>
      <p>Yet newly-revealed classified documents suggest that the camps Beijing runs in China’s far west are instead secret centres for forced ideological and behavioural re-education.</p>
      <p>The confidential blueprint, leaked to international journalists, lay out the Chinese government’s deliberate strategy to lock up minorities, most of whom are Muslims, to rewire their thoughts and the language they speak.</p>
      <p>The documents highlight how watch towers, double-locked doors and blanket video surveillance are used ‘to prevent escapes’ and describe a scoring system that grades detainees on how well they speak Mandarin, memorise ideology and adhere to strict rules on everything down to bathing and using the toilet.</p>

      <p>They also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>With the help of mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation or detention in just one week, including university students and party officials who would not need vocational training.</p>
      <p>Together, the documents are being seen as the most significant description yet of how the mass detention camps work in the words of the Chinese government – who has since labelled the leaks ‘fake news’.</p>
      <p>Experts say they spell out a vast system that targets, monitors and grades entire ethnicities, especially Uighurs, a minority of about 10 million with its own language and culture.</p>
      <p>Adrian Zenz, a leading security expert in the far western region of Xinjiang, where many Uighurs live, said: ‘They confirm that this is a form of cultural genocide.</p>
      <p>‘It really shows that from the onset, the Chinese government had a plan.’</p>

      <p>Mr Zenz said the documents back up the claims of a 2017 report, which said the camps were intended to ‘wash brains, cleanse hearts, support the right, remove the wrong.’</p>

      <p>China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where hundreds, both Uighurs and Han Chinese, have died in terror attacks and race riots.</p>
      <p>In 2014, President Xi Jinping launched what he called a People’s War on Terror in response to attacks carried out by radical Uighur militants.</p>
      <p>In late 2016, the crackdown intensified dramatically when Mr Xi named Chen Quanguo, a hardline official transferred from Tibet, as Xinjiang’s new head. Most of the documents were issued in 2017.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Chinese embassy in the UK said: ‘Since the measures have been taken, there’s no single terrorist incident in the past three years.</p>

      <p>‘Xinjiang is much safer… The so-called leaked documents are fabrication and fake news.’</p>
      <p>The statement said that religious freedom and the personal freedom of detainees was ‘fully respected’ in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>The documents came from an anonymous source, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists verified them by consulting experts, cross-checking content and comparing signatures.</p>
      <p>They consist of a notice with guidelines for the camps, four bulletins on how to use technology to target people, and a court case sentencing a local Uighur party official to 10 years in prison for telling colleagues not to say dirty words, watch porn or eat without praying.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Issued to rank-and-file officials by the powerful Xinjiang Communist Party Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the documents confirm what is known about the camps from the testimony of Uighurs and Kazakhs, satellite imagery and highly restricted visits by journalists to the region.</p>
      <p>Independent experts on Chinese law say the detentions are a clear violation of the country’s own laws.</p>
