      <p>LOS ANGELES (CNN) - Actor Michael J. Pollard, known for his roles in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Star Trek," has died at the age of 80.</p>
      <p>Pollard died Wednesday of cardiac arrest at a Los Angeles hospital, his longtime friend Dawn Walker told The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
      <p>Pollard received an Academy Award nomination for his role as a gas station attendant turned accomplice in the 1967 film "Bonnie and Clyde." He appeared in several television shows in the 1960s, including "Star Trek" and "The Andy Griffith Show."</p>
      <p>Rob Zombie, who directed Pollard in the 2003 film "House of 1000 Corpses," posted his condolences on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RobZombie/">Facebook </a>early Friday.</p>
      <p>"He was one of the first actors I knew I had to work with as soon as I got my first film off the ground. He will be missed," Zombie said.</p>
      <p>"Michael was a well known character actor on so many shows. Condolences to his family," "Star Trek" star William Shatner <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1197948612107309056">tweeted</a> Friday.</p>
      <p>Actor Michael J. Fox adopted the "J" in his name early in his career in homage to Pollard, according to Fox's Parkinson foundation <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/michaels-story">website</a>.</p>
      <p>Pollard is survived by his son and daughter.</p>
