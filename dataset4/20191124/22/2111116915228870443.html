      <h3>The best Apple Watch bands: our pick of the great Apple wearable straps</h3>
      <p>Make your Apple Watch bands work for any outfit or occasion</p>
      <p>Not content with being one of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074"><u>the best smartwatches</u></a> money can buy, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/which-apple-watch-should-i-buy"><u>Apple Watch</u></a> has the best selection of official and third-party bands on the market. Paired with the choice in size and color of the watch itself, new Apple Watch bands can totally personalize the Apple Watch so it’s right for you.</p>
      <p>It also means you can have several different straps that you can rotate depending on if you’re at work, the gym or at a fancy dinner. When the bands are so easy to switch over, you can change your look in seconds.</p>
      <p>There is a huge selection of Apple Watch bands, from Apple’s many official offerings to a whole host of silicone, fabric and metal straps made to fit by other companies. There are even NATO-style straps here, though you can’t have an actual NATO strap as the material would cover the Watch’s heart rate sensor. </p>
      <p>The great thing about the Apple Watch is that despite the new design of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-watch-4-review"><u>Apple Watch 4 </u></a>and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-watch-5-review"><u>Apple Watch 5</u></a>, older straps will still fit. The 38mm straps designed for the Apple Watch 1, 2 and 3 will fit the 40mm newer models, while the 42mm straps will fit the newer 44mm models.</p>
      <p>New 40mm and 44mm straps are therefore backwards compatible with older 38mm and 42mm Apple Watches respectively. </p>
      <p>The versatility afforded by such a wide selection of straps is great, but it means there are far too many to choose from. That’s why we’ve picked our twelve favorites - there’s something for every taste here. </p>

      <p><b>What you need to know about Black Friday 2019</b><br/>If you're on the hunt for a new Apple Watch strap, you may be wise to hold off until the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cyber-monday/cyber-monday-2019">Cyber Monday</a> sales hit.

      <h4>1. Clockwork Synergy Classic NATO Band</h4>
      <p>NATO style without obscuring the sensor</p>
      <aside>$21.99 View at AmazonCheck Walmart<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Clockwork%20Synergy%20Classic%20NATO%20Band">See all prices (3 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Doesn’t obscure sensor<br/>+ Classic NATO looks and some modern designs too<br/>- Pride design doesn’t help charity<br/>- Prohibitive shipping to UK</p>
      <p>Pedants would argue that these aren’t NATO bands, because that describes a very particular kind of strap that runs under the watch itself, whereas these are two-part Apple Watch straps. But screw those guys! </p>
      <p>These NATO-a-likes look very much like the real thing and come in a range of designs clearly designed to cover all bases – so there’s a good old-fashioned US flag right next to a brightly colored Pride rainbow (although unlike Apple’s Pride band there’s no charity benefiting here), and plenty of other options too.</p>

      <h4>2. Casetify Printed Apple Watch Band</h4>
      <p>A huge range of designs to suit every taste</p>
      <aside>$50 View at Amazon$50View at Amazon$52View at Casetify (Global)<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Casetify%20Printed%20Apple%20Watch%20Band">See all prices (10 found)</a>44 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆</aside>
      <p>+ Huge selection<br/>+ Something for everyone<br/>- Faux leather<br/>- Some are hideous</p>
      <p>Casetify’s printed bands are tons of fun, and probably cheaper than you might expect. Made from cruelty-free faux leather, the bands come in a dizzying variety of designs and colors from animal prints and bold florals to geometric patterns, emoji and flags.</p>
      <p>There should be something here to suit all tastes and all kinds of looks: for example, there’s a beautiful black strap with dark red and grey florals that would go well with a nice frock, or you could relive the 1990s with fluorescent smiley faces.</p>
      <p>Straps come in both watch sizes and you can choose between gold, black or silver fixings and buckles.</p>

      <h4>3. Southern Straps Nylon Apple Watch Band</h4>
      <p>Made by hand and built to last</p>
      <aside>$45 View at Amazon$45View at Amazon$45View at Amazon<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Southern%20Straps%20Nylon%20Apple%20Watch%20Band">See all prices (62 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Beautifully made<br/>+ Long straps<br/>- Nylon isn’t for everyone<br/>- Expensive to ship internationally</p>
      <p>You don’t get many Apple Watch straps offering a five-year warranty, but then you don’t get many Apple Watch straps made as beautifully as this.</p>
      <p>Handmade in San Francisco from a single piece of nylon and with hardware that’s noticeably higher quality than the majority of similar products, these straps come in a variety of colors including NATO-style stripes in sober and fun colors.</p>
      <p>There are 84 possible combinations – and they’re bigger than some: if you’ve got larger hands you’ll appreciate the fit of up to 25cm.</p>
      <p>Fascinating fact: Southern Straps was the first company to put NATO-style straps on the Apple Watch without obscuring the heart rate sensor.</p>

      <h4>4. Hoco Original Stainless Steel Strap Bracelet for Apple Watch</h4>
      <p>Very metal, but not very expensive</p>
      <aside>Check AmazonCheck Walmart<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Hoco%20Original%20Stainless%20Steel%20Strap%20Bracelet%20for%20Apple%20Watch">See all prices (2 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Much cheaper than Apple’s ones<br/>+ Looks and feels pretty good<br/>- Won’t last like Apple’s ones<br/>- Hard to find in the US</p>
      <p>If you like the look of Apple’s Stainless steel bands but also like being able to afford to eat, Hoco’s bands are an attractive and affordable alternative: this is around 1/10th of the price of Apple’s link bracelet.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect it’s not quite up to Apple standards – the dark ones still have edges where the original metal is peeking through and their finish is prone to scratching – and while there’s a link removal tool to get the right fit the process is really quite fiddly.</p>
      <p>But it’s nice on and it both looks and feels better than similar-looking but cheaper competitors.</p>

      <h4>5. Apple Nike Sport Band</h4>
      <p>Simple, stylish and won’t suffocate your skin</p>
      <aside>$49 View at Best Buy$49View at Apple$49View at Macy's<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Apple%20Nike%20Sport%20Band">See all prices (26 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Breathable<br/>+ Stylish<br/>- Expensive<br/>- Some are garish</p>
      <p>The official Apple/Nike Sport Band has the toughness and design simplicity of the normal Sport Band, but it also has those compression-molded perforations – or what we like to call "holes”.</p>
      <p>Those holes make a big difference to the long-term comfort of the Apple Watch because they enable your skin to breathe under the strap.</p>
      <p>The range of colors isn’t quite as exhaustive as for the normal Sport Band and some, like the Black/Volt one, are a little loud for wearing outside the gym, but there are still some subtle shades such as Teal Tint, Smokey Mauve and Spruce Fog.</p>

      <h4>6. Apple Sport Band</h4>
      <p>The original is still an excellent all-rounder</p>
      <aside>$45.99 View at Best Buy$49View at Walmart$49View at Apple<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Apple%20Sport%20Band">See all prices (32 found)</a>154 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆</aside>
      <p>+ Lots of colors<br/>+ Simple and hard-wearing<br/>- Fastening isn’t for everyone<br/>- Not breathable</p>
      <p>If you’d rather not have a band full of holes the original Sport band remains an excellent all-rounder.</p>
      <p>It’s pricey because Apple, but it’s also made of nicer materials than the knock-offs you’ll find on certain auction sites – and that means you’re not going to end up with odd things happening to your skin after a few hours of wear.</p>
      <p>It’s available in fifteen colors to suit most outfits and there’s a charity-helping Product Red version too. You don’t need to worry about getting the right size, either: you get S/M and M/L straps in the same box.</p>

      <h4>7. Apple Sport Loop</h4>
      <p>Apple’s nylon bands are stylish, if a bit pricey</p>
      <aside>$24.99 View at Walmart$25View at Amazon$39View at Adorama<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Apple%20Watch%20Sport%20Loop">See all prices (62 found)</a>63 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆</aside>
      <p>+ Typical Apple quality<br/>+ Clever design for breathability<br/>- Typical Apple pricing<br/>- Some are a little bright</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s another official Apple strap and that means official Apple money – but we’ve found Apple’s nylon bands to be really hard-wearing and comfortable. The Sport Loop is made from double-layer nylon and has a clever design on the skin side that uses larger loops for cushioning and breathability.</p>
      <p>Because it’s a sports design the colors can be on the bright side, but the Cerulean, Product Red and Pink Sand versions are a bit more subtle and there are some suitably sober blacks and greys too. It’s a useful option for fans of NATO straps who don’t want to cover their Apple Watch’s sensors.</p>

      <h4>8. Ullu Skinny Strap for Apple Watch</h4>
      <p>Like leather but don’t like Apple’s prices? Try this</p>
      <aside>Check AmazonCheck Walmart<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Ullu%20Skinny%20Strap%20for%20Apple%20Watch">See all prices (2 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Italian leather<br/>+ Lots of colors<br/>- Stainless steel only<br/>- Doesn’t qualify for free shipping</p>
      <p>Here’s a slightly cheaper alternative to Apple’s leather bands. Ullu’s Skinny Strap is made from good quality Italian leather and comes in eleven colors, all of which have been hand-colored – although unfortunately the lugs and buckles only come in stainless steel.</p>
      <p>Because it’s real leather it will get more interesting over time as the leather ages, and that means no two straps will ever be the same. If the Skinny Straps seem a little too thin, Ullu also makes a padded version that uses the same kind of leather, comes in a similar range of colors and costs the same.</p>

      <h4>9. Apple Leather Loop / Modern Buckle</h4>
      <p>Beautiful bands in a choice of textures</p>

      <p>+ Beautiful<br/>+ Tasteful<br/>- Expensive<br/>- Limited colors</p>
      <p>At $149/£149 they’re hardly cheap, but Apple’s Leather options are genuinely beautiful. And one of these is still less than a third of the price of some Apple/Hermes ones.</p>
      <p>There are two different designs here. The Modern Buckle is a smooth leather with a large rectangular buckle that echoes the shape of the Watch itself, while the Leather Loop has a ribbed, textured leather and a Sport band-style hidden fastener.</p>
      <p>There aren’t a huge range of colors to choose from – three Modern Buckle designs and four Leather Loops including the obligatory Product Red – but they run from bold reds and oranges to gentle lilacs.</p>

      <p>An iconic look</p>

      <p>+ Adds a very premium look<br/>+ Comfortable, breathable<br/>- Can snag on arm hairs<br/>- Expensive</p>
      <p>Possibly the most sought-after Apple Watch band, the attention that the Milanese Loop band receives is warranted.</p>
      <p>At a similar price to the Leather Band, owners can get their feet wet with a cool-to-the-touch stainless steel band that ekes elegance and simplicity in its design.</p>
      <p>You'll know at first glance if this band is for you, and if it is, you can choose between traditional silver and black options.</p>

      <h4>11. Apple Link Bracelet band</h4>
      <p>The more serious, high-end option</p>
      <aside>$349 View at Apple$421.49View at Amazon$449View at Best Buy<a href="https://www.techradar.com/deals/compare?productTypes=vpn%2Csubscriptions%2Cdeals%2Cfallback&amp;modelName=Apple%20Link%20Bracelet">See all prices (9 found)</a></aside>
      <p>+ Customizable links<br/>+ Stainless steel won't wear over time<br/>- Costs more than the Apple Watch</p>
      <p>OK, now we're getting up there in price. Apple offers up its brushed stainless steel Link Bracelet, but it isn't going to be cheap.</p>
      <p>Build materials aside, this couldn't be any more different than the Milanese Loop. Rocking a look akin to high-end analog watches, the Link Bracelet possesses a sophisticated sheen that the others don't.</p>
      <p>Equipped with a watch tool, you can customize the size to perfectly fit your wrist and if silver doesn't suit you, it's also available in black. Paired with the Apple Watch, this is probably one of the slickest bands you can make your own.</p>

      <h4>12. Hermès Fauve Barenia Leather Single Tour band</h4>
      <p>An even more premium leather band</p>

      <p>+ Hermès quality on the wrist<br/>+ Arguably the best leather you can get<br/>- Expensive</p>
      <p>One look at the name and you know this is going to be pricey. For your money, you're getting industry-leading Hermès design in a band, complete with master-class fabric stitching and leather quality that's unparalleled in the vast batch of Apple Watch bands available. </p>
      <p>It might cost a lot, but if you're a watch aficionado, there's not substitute for quality.</p>
