      <h1>Giants report card: Pat Shurmur can’t get his team in sync</h1>

        <i>Grading the Giants after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/giants-sink-to-familiar-dark-place-in-loss-to-bears/">their 19-14 loss to the Bears</a> on Sunday.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Offense</h3>
      <p>Look no further than this: The Giants were 1-for-12 on third-down conversions. This was an inept showing. Only 243 total yards. Daniel Jones (21 of 36, 2 TDs) threw for just 150 yards and yet again lost a fumble on a strip-sack. He looked quite sluggish early and missed on several throws. Saquon Barkley (17-59) did not get untracked and was no factor (two catches for 1 yard) in the passing game. Longest reception was Golden Tate’s 23-yard touchdown. LB Khalil Mack did not wreck the game, but he certainly affected it. Good to see Sterling Shepard (5-15) back on the field.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> F</p>
      <h3>Defense</h3>
      <p>It is not easy to make Mitchell Trubisky a winning quarterback, but the Giants did it. Trubisky (25 of 41, 278 yards, 1 TD, 2 INTs) was nothing special. Big end zone interception by Alec Ogletree and another by rookie Julian Love. Stopping the run (65 yards allowed) was no problem. Rookie CB Corey Ballentine had a rough afternoon. Holding penalty on Janoris Jenkins nullified a Markus Golden sack, and all but handed the Bears their first TD. This unit deserved better, considering it gave up only one legitimate touchdown drive and allowed only three points in the first half.</p>

      <h3>Special Teams</h3>
      <p>Aldrick Rosas missed field goal attempts from 42 and 43 yards, which is unacceptable. Terrible snap by Zak DeOssie never got off the grass and led to Rosas missing the 42-yarder wide right. Holder Riley Dixon did all he could to get the ball down, but could not salvage the shoddy operation. Dixon had a 62-yard punt roll dead on the Chicago 6-yard line and put four of his five kicks down inside the 20. Jabrill Peppers scooped up a punt on a bounce and scooted 40 yards on the return in the second quarter. Eli Penny was called for a holding penalty on the first punt return.</p>
      <p><b>Grade: </b>C-</p>
      <h3>Coaching</h3>
      <p>Pat Shurmur is finding it impossible to get his team in sync. Thus, when the defense puts in a credible performance, the offense cannot get out of its own way. He has to get his receivers to run routes beyond the first-down marker. The plan was to get even younger on defense, with CB Sam Beal getting snaps, often replacing rookie DeAndre Baker. A youth movement down the stretch of a bad season is nothing to quibble with.</p>
