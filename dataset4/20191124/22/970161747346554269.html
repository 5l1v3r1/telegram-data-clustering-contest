      <p>I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! stars <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> got into a spat on tonight’s episode of the show.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter, ex football-player and ex-rugby player, who along with the rest of the camp are at this point very tired and hungry, argued over chivalry, of all things.</p>
      <p>As the camp made a plan for tomorrow’s live challenge, the trio clashed over the order in which the celebrities would participate.</p>
      <p>As well as stars for the group, winners of the challenge would win a roast dinner in the Jungle Dining Room for one camp mate, based on descending order that the team must decide on beforehand.</p>
      <p>Therefore those in position one, two and so on had a higher chance of getting a roast dinner.</p>
      <p>This promptly caused tensions to rise.</p>

      <p>It was eventually decided that the women of the camp would go at the top (in order: Adele, Jacqueline, Nadine, Caitlyn and Kate) with the men then following (James, Myles, Roman, Andrew, Ian, Cliff and Andy).</p>

      <p>James then snapped: ‘Can we just all agree moving forward that for anything else and I think every man in here agrees that woman go first and cut all that chivalrous nonsense.’</p>
      <p>Kate snapped back: But that is chivalrous nonsense.’</p>
      <p>To this James replied: ‘You fight every time, just got with it,’ with Kate responding: ‘I’m allowed to have a view too.’</p>
      <p>Ian then chimed in and said to Kate: ‘You’re too nice, that’s how you ended up in the other camp.’</p>

      <p>Then, James finally added: ‘We don’t need a debate, women go first, men after that.’</p>
      <p>Drama.</p>
      <p>Tensions didn’t simmer there though as Ian and Andy got into a spat over the way the Match of the Day star spoke to his campmate.</p>
      <p>‘You keep shouting at me Ian,’ Andy said while standing up.</p>
      <p>Ian looked at him and said: ‘Who is shouting, when did I shout?’ to which Andrew replied: ‘Just then.’</p>
      <p>After a few moments, Andy said: ‘I’m sorry, I’m really tired, I don’t know, I’m really tired… You’re my pal and I’m just really sensitive.’</p>
      <p>Ian then extended the olive branch and said: ‘We’re both hungry, we’re both tired,’ before hugging it out.</p>
