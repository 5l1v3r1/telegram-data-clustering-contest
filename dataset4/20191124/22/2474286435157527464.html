      <h1>Moree, Goondiwindi and Narrabri communities hear of dire situation for Gwydir, Border Rivers and Namoi river systems</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Harris</a></address>
      <p>The Moree, Goondiwindi and Narrabri communities were told of the "dire" situation the Gwydir, Border Rivers and Namoi river systems are facing during public drought information sessions in the region this week.</p>
      <p>The Department of Industry, Planning and Environment (DPIE) - Water, WaterNSW and the NSW Department of Primary Industries Fisheries <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6491008/latest-round-of-drought-consultations-coming-to-the-region/">visited each of the three communities on November 19, 20 and 21</a> to provide an update on water availability and the status of proposed and potential future measures to preserve water in the river system.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the situation is pretty dire in the North West and far western NSW," DPIE acting water drought coordinator Tracey Barton said.</p>
      <p>"It's important the community knows the situation they're facing."</p>
      <p>At this stage, the Gwydir system is in a "slightly better" situation than Namoi and Border Rivers, being at stage three severe.</p>
      <p>"So supplies are limited," Ms Barton said.</p>
      <p>"Copeton Dam is at seven per cent but WaterNSW can still supply high priority needs, such as high security licences, stock and domestic needs and town water supply."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Border Rivers is in stage four severe drought, which means water is being used entirely to meet critical town supply needs. There was recently a <a href="https://www.goondiwindiargus.com.au/story/6397696/dam-release-saves-towns-from-water-woes-for-now/">release from Glenlyon Dam to supply Goondiwindi and Boggabilla</a>, however that was the last release that can be made until conditions improve, which will have a downstream impact on Mungindi.</p>
      <p>Namoi is also in the critical stage four and has been for some time. The last release from Keepit Dam was in December last year and with Keepit now empty, there can be no more releases until after sufficient rainfall is received.</p>
      <p>"A majority of towns in the Namoi are on ground water except Walgett," Ms Barton said.</p>
      <p>"That last big release was to get water to Walgett.</p>
      <p>"It's not looking good."</p>
      <p>The NSW government is supporting councils through financial and technical assistance to secure water supplies..</p>
      <p>Ms Barton said the government's number one priority is to ensure towns don't entirely run out of water.</p>
      <p>"We're operating the river systems to extend town water supplies for as long as possible," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Barton said most people were accepting and understanding of the situation during the community consultations this past week.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the consistent message we hear is that people are acknowledging that this is the worst drought, in the Border Rivers and Namoi in particular," she said.</p>
      <p>"People are saying they've never seen it this bad. In-flow records are pointing to that; we've had significantly worse inflows than the previous drought.</p>
      <p>"People do understand that - everyone knows it's tough and everyone's suffering.</p>
      <p>"There's acceptance of that. We all agree that we need to do as much as we can to protect water."</p>
      <p>The consultations also provided an update on the latest rainfall forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) which has predicted a very hot, dry December.</p>
      <p>According to the BoM, there's a 50 per cent chance that we may get average rainfall next year, which Ms Barton said is a "little glimmer of hope".</p>
      <p>"The important point is the BoM is saying, when we get rain, we need four to five months of average rainfall to improve soil moisture to get decent run-off into the rivers," she said.</p>
      <p>DPI Fisheries were also in attendance to provide an update on the work they're doing to protect native fish.</p>
      <p>It's likely there will be another round of consultations in the region in about February or March next year to update the community on the situation. Ms Barton said she hopes by then we'll have had rain, so they'll be able to talk about what to do with the water.</p>
      <p>"If it doesn't rain, it'll be time to say, 'how much more can we do to batten down the hatches?'" she said.</p>
