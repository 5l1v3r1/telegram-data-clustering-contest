      <p>Following the devastating (for her) revelation in <i>The Walking Dead</i>’s previous episode that Alpha has been lying to her followers about sacrificing Lydia, Gamma starts the midseason finale by completely changing her priorities in her next <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-aaron-meets-gamma/">meeting with Aaron</a>. She wants to know if her sister’s baby is still alive. She asks what the couple who adopted him named him and expresses a desire to see him. Aaron points out that the Whisperers left the baby to die. Why would they ever let her see him after that? So Gamma offers information in exchange for a visit.</p>

      <p>Aaron won’t promise anything. He says if he can verify the information that she gives him, though, they might be able to arrange something. He also demands <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-gamma-unmasks-reveals-name-in-mid-season-finale-clip/">she remove her mask</a>. Once he can see her face, Gamma shares her name: Mary.</p>

      <p>Aaron brings Mary’s information back to Alexandria. It turns out Mary revealed the thing Carol’s coveted since she <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-characters-in-season-10-premiere/">hit dry land in the premiere</a>: the location of Alpha’s walker horde. Carol wants to leave to check it out right after Siddiq’s funeral, but Daryl disagrees. It's probably misinformation -- it came from a Whisperer after all. Besides, they should search for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-whisperer-spy-dante/">Lydia who took off in the previous episode</a> after she realized Carol was using her to destroy the Whisperers’ loyalty to Alpha. Aaron believes Mary, however, so Daryl relents.</p>

      <p>Daryl decides they’ll check out Mary’s intel and then go search for Lydia. However, he suggests that Carol stay behind. He doesn’t trust her after Lydia's abrupt departure. Carol tells him an abbreviated version of what happened and says she’ll help him look for her, but she doesn’t think Lydia wants to be found. Daryl points out that they could be talking about Carol.</p>
      <p>Later after the funeral, Carol, Daryl, and Aaron meet a group from Hilltop that includes Connie, Kelly, Magna, and Jerry. They go to check out the area where Mary claimed the Whisperers were keeping the horde. In her haste to get there, Carol almost springs a foot trap, but Daryl stops her. Once again he tries to get through to her. He tells her Alpha’s not worth Carol’s life. They’ll get her eventually. Carol shouldn’t let her desire for revenge get the better of her in the meantime. Carol agrees and composes herself.</p>

      <p>When they get to the valley that Mary specified, though, there’s nothing there. Aaron still thinks Mary was telling the truth. He believes Alpha must have moved the horde. Daryl just wants to find Lydia.</p>
      <p>As they search the woods, Carol notices something. Daryl tries to get her to fall back in line but she insists on going to check it out. So Daryl and the group follow her. Carol peers through the trees and discovers Alpha standing across a clearing. Carol takes off running toward her. Alpha turns and runs into a cave. Alpha's clearly leading her there but Carol doesn’t seem to care.</p>
      <p>The rest of the group is held up by a small group of walkers. After they take care of the pesky zombies, they run into the cave after Carol. Daryl is the last one in and when he finally finds the group, they're standing on a ledge staring into a large cavern that’s chock full of walkers. Carol got her wish after all: they’ve found Alpha’s horde.</p>
