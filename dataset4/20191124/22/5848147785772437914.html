      <h1>Sellers in position of strength as clearance rates hold firm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:03:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/jonathan-chancellor/" target="_blank">Jonathan Chancellor</a></address>
      <p>Melbourne recorded its lowest non-holiday weekend auction result in nearly four months on Saturday although the market remains generally in favour of sellers, housing economist Dr Andrew Wilson said.</p>
      <p>But Dr Wilson noted the typical surge in late spring auction listings had failed to slow the Sydney auction market.</p>
      <p>CoreLogic auction analyst Kevin Brogan said clearance rates across the largest cities have mostly remained above 70 per cent since July, implying that vendors remain in a strong selling position, he said.</p>
      <p>“Next week we are expecting auction numbers to lift by around 14 per cent, to be the biggest week of auctions held so far this year,” Mr Brogan said.</p>
      <p>Despite the emerging difference in market sentiment, there was just $5000 difference between the cheapest offerings in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
      <p>There was a $305,000 sale at Essendon when <a href="https://www.nelsonalexander.com.au/property/845721/11-158-napier-street/">11/158 Napier Street</a> was sold.</p>

      <p>The renovated, one-bedroom ground-floor unit sold through Nelson Alexander Essendon had a price guide of $285,000 to $310,000.</p>

      <p>A 73-square-metre unit at Auburn was Sydney’s cheapest sale at $310,000.</p>
      <p>The two bedroom at 2/66 Dartbrook Road, was on the market for the first time since selling in 1987 for $48,000, according to CoreLogic.</p>
      <p>The garden apartment, that sold through Ascott Real Estate, sits in a block of just 12.</p>
