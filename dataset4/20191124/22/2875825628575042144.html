      <p>He said: "Jacqueline was shook when she got the news she was nominated again.</p>
      <p>"There is literally nothing you can say that will make her feel better, frankly you will annoy her, or by you I mean me, I annoy her."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline cried her eyes out before admitting that she "worries and thinks why are people voting me".</p>
      <p>The emotional star told the Bush Telegraph that there is only so much you can do before you break and "I hope I don't break".</p>

      <p>The mum-of-two then enjoyed a pep talk from hunky camp leader James Haskell, who encouraged her to try her best in the trial</p>
      <p>The actress recollected herself and told the cameras: "I took myself off and had a little moment.</p>
      <p>I looked at my kids in my pillow and that's the reason I'm doing this."</p>
      <p>While Jacqueline revealed she felt better with Ian by her side, the duo agreed to give the Bushtucker trial a go.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec made a hilarious joke at Jacqueline's emotional reaction to being selected by sarcastically saying she was 'subtle' in showing her emotions .</p>
      <p>Viewers instantly took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to comment on Jacqueline's floods of tears prior to doing the Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "They probably filled the trial up with Jacqueline's tears."</p>
      <p>While another shared: "Why does Jacqueline get so upset over trials? She absolutely smashes them."</p>
      <p>A third seemed sceptical: "I'm not having that Jacqueline is crying and sobbing about doing these tasks.... Clearly all an act as there's no evidence of it at all when she actually does them!"</p>
      <p>Another agreed by writing: "This proves Jacqueline is playing up to the camera's. Constantly crying then smashing the trials".</p>
