      <h1>Lyndon Dykes issues Scotland come-and-get-me plea as Livingston striker eyes play-off call-up</h1>
      <h2>The Australia-born Livi forward has insists he wants to play for Steve Clarke’s side after spending weeks pondering his options.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:29:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Swan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/craig-swan/</a></address>
      <p>Lyndon Dykes has nailed his colours to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/">Scotland</a>’s international mast.</p>
      <p>The Australia-born <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston">Livingston</a> striker insists he wants to play for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a>’s side after spending weeks pondering his options.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old had at first intimated that Australia would be a preferred option if he had the opportunity as it was the country of his birth.</p>
      <p>However, Dykes has now changed his outlook and said: “I’ve said a couple of things in the last few weeks, but I’ve sat down at home and my son was born in Scotland. My parents are Scottish.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really have any family born in Australia besides me and my sister, so I don’t see why I couldn’t play for Scotland, to be honest.</p>

      <p>“I watched them in the international break and they have a brilliant team. If I ever got the opportunity I’d love to play for Scotland.</p>
      <p>“When it all started it’s a lot of talk. You go with the flow. But then I see Shanks (<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-shankland">Lawrence Shankland</a>) pulled out injured and they called up (Eamonn) Brophy.</p>
      <p>“I think: Why can’t I do this? And also I’ve lived here for a few years now. My parents were born here, I’ve got Scottish blood.</p>
      <p>“I’m not someone who’s just rocked up in the country for the first time and wants to play, so I thought to myself I could maybe try and make it a goal for myself, to try to play for Scotland.</p>
      <p>“I think they’ve got a fighting spirit watching them and I really hope they make the Euros now. I’d love to be a part of that, if I ever got an opportunity of course.</p>

      <p>“But I’m just putting my head down and not getting carried away with that kind of stuff.</p>
      <p>“I’ve still got to perform and show I’m good enough for a step-up.</p>
      <p>“After watching them, they played well. John McGinn was the stand-out, but I think I can maybe give a little bit of a different option for Steve Clarke.</p>
      <p>“I’m putting my head down and I’m going to try to work to maybe get into one of the international squads.”</p>
