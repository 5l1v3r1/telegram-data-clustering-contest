      <h1>War on Waste inspires Australia’s first ‘circular economy’ coffee cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:05:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/isabelle-lane/" target="_blank">Isabelle Lane</a></address>
      <p>As the backlash to <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/consumer/2019/06/26/toxic-plastic-packaging/">single-use</a> products grows, BYO reusable coffee cups have become popular among busy office workers looking to enjoy a takeaway cup of coffee without adding more waste to landfill.</p>
      <p>But in a coffee-loving nation, the flaw lies in the simple fact that not everyone has a cup on hand when a caffeine craving hits.</p>
      <p>That’s a problem The Cup eXchange co-founder Marty Rowell set out to solve using a system that’s growing in popularity around the world: The circular economy.</p>
      <h3>What is the circular economy?</h3>

      <p>As climate change pushes environmental concerns to the fore, the concept of the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/consumer/2019/10/14/ikea-furniture-buy-back-scheme/">circular economy</a> is gaining support among brands and consumers.</p>
      <p>A circular economy – as opposed to a linear economy – aims to end the continual use of Earth’s finite resources by eliminating waste.</p>
      <p>Under a circular (or ‘closed loop’) model, production is made more efficient while the environmental impact is reduced.</p>
      <p>“We can produce many things while also reducing the amount of waste we produce”, Professor Michele John, the director of the Sustainable Engineering Group at Curtin University, explained.</p>
      <p>“If we’re producing any waste we look at how can we include that waste back in the original production system.’’</p>
      <h3>‘The world as our warehouse’</h3>
      <p>Mr Rowell and his brother Jeremy hit upon the idea for a circular-economy coffee cup after watching the ABC’s popular <i>War on Waste</i> program in 2017.</p>
      <p>To illustrate the sheer volume of waste going into landfill every day, the show demonstrated that the 50,000 single-use coffee cups disposed of every 30 minutes in Australia were enough to fill an entire Melbourne tram.</p>

      <p>“My brother Jeremy and I really looked at that and saw it was a big problem, but the call to action was to bring a container in and demand a 30 cent discount,” Mr Rowell said.</p>
      <p>“And we thought that wasn’t really fair on the small businesses … It’s not their fault that there’s no better solution than these paper cups.</p>
      <p>“So we thought about it hard and said, well, how do we stop the waste by having a better system?”</p>
      <p>The brothers dismissed the idea of simply “trying to make a better cup”, as that “doesn’t solve convenience for the user”.</p>
      <p>“If you’ve got a personal reusable cup you’ve got all of the inconvenience problems with it – you’ve still got to wash it, still got to carry it, still got to remember it,” Mr Rowell said.</p>
      <blockquote>You only want the cup while you get your coffee, then you want it to disappear.’’</blockquote>
      <p>Instead, they decided to treat takeaway cups as an “inventory management problem”.</p>
      <p>Rather than “making more stuff” they would “treat the world as our warehouse”, Mr Rowell said.</p>
      <p>The result was The Cup eXchange, Australia’s first smartphone-enabled circular-economy coffee cup subscription service, which launched last month at cafes in Melbourne’s Rialto precinct.</p>
      <h3>A ‘library of cups’: How it works</h3>

      <p>The Cup Exchange works like a library system – a customer becomes a member and is able to borrow from a “library of cups” when ordering their daily coffee, Mr Rowell explained.</p>
      <p>Each cup has a unique identifier – a QR code – that is scanned before it leaves the cafe and linked directly to the customer’s account.</p>
      <p>When they’re finished with their coffee, the customer leaves the cup in one of a number of dedicated deposit boxes in the vicinity, where it is collected, washed and returned to the cafe.</p>
      <p>The system is environmentally friendly and economic: “The cost-per-use comes right down and is much, much lower than a paper cup”, Mr Rowell said.</p>
      <p>“What we’re doing is tracking products, and whoever the custodian is as that point in time,” he explained.</p>
      <blockquote>Rather than ownership, it’s custodianship. It goes round and round.’’</blockquote>
