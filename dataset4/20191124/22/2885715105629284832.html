      <h1>View From The Neighbourhood: Gotabaya’s assurance</h1>
      <h2>While Gotabaya has won the poll, he has not done so by transcending the ethnolinguistic divide that has haunted Sri Lanka for so long.</h2>

      <p>In its first editorial after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became President of Sri Lanka,The Island, on November 23 congratulates the victor, noting that the margin of the victory belied the expectations of many analysts who thought that no party/candidate would poll a majority. The logic behind this apprehension was this: “It has been parroted ad nauseam that Mahinda Rajapaksa narrowly lost the 2015 presidential election despite getting a very large proportion of the rural vote outside the north and east (Sinhala-Buddhist) because his opponent, with a minority of the majority scored a massive majority of the minorities.”</p>
      <p>While Gotabaya has won the poll, he has not done so by transcending the ethnolinguistic divide that has haunted Sri Lanka for so long. “The electoral map clearly shows an ethnic division in the voting pattern. Let us not forget that the minorities voted for a Sinhala candidate despite having candidates of their own ethnicity on the ultra-long ballot paper. They were obviously pragmatic not wanting to waste their votes by voting for anybody who clearly could not win,” remarks the editorial.</p>
      <p>It goes on to make an important point, one that bears repeating. It notes both the “disturbing display of racism” in the aftermath of the elections as well as the president’s statement that “he is the president of all Lankans”. If Gotabaya has taken note of the “incipient” divisive tendencies and is trying to nip them in the bud, he must be encouraged.</p>

        <b>A balancing act</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ameen Izzadeen, in his column in The Daily Mirror on November 22, looks at the foreign policy challenges in front of the new government. He notes that unlike the 2015 elections, there was little outside interference, or the perception thereof, in these polls. Before giving the substance of his arguments, it is important to understand the premises on which they rest. First, Sri Lanka’s strategic position in the Indian Ocean makes it of great interest to both superpowers — the US and China — as well as India. And second, the Sri Lankan economy has been stagnant for the last few years and investment must be revived.</p>
      <p>Izzadeen argues that non-alignment is the best path for Sri Lanka, and that “smart government can certainly convert the country’ geostrategic position into its economic advantage, without compromising the nation’s territorial integrity.” But this will be challenging.</p>
      <p>China, he says, will be the country’s “economic saviour” because it must protect and expand the projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. On the other hand, “The US has found in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa a leader who enjoys the people’s trust and, therefore, it probably believes that under his government, the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) and the Millennium Corporation Challenge Agreement could be signed with some minor amendments. The $480 million grant under the MCC agreement is too tempting for the new government to resist as its infusion into the national economy can get the economy moving once again.”</p>
      <p>The third power, India, argues the article, has confidence in Rajapaksa’s leadership and close political and economic ties must be developed. However, Indian analysts, in the past, have not viewed kindly China’s investments in Sri Lanka. But things may be different now: “Indian Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a>’s invitation to the new president to visit India — first made during a phone conversation he had and then by the visiting India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar — is more than symbolic. It indicates how important Sri Lanka is to India as a strategic partner.” How it manages to stay neutral amidst these conflicting demands will be the real challenge for Colombo.</p>

        <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/">NRC</a> gamble</b>
      </p>
      <p>The November 22 editorial in The Express Tribune tries to use the NRC as a take-off point to show that India is in dire straits. Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/">National Register of Citizens</a> exercise will be implemented across the country and redone in Assam has allowed the editorial to ramp up its rhetoric: “With the stakes even higher this time, those who saw the incompetence with which the Assam exercise was done would not accept anything less than a general or a government cabinet member being certified ‘not Indian’.”</p>
      <p>Saying that the NRC reflects the “<a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> government’s deep-seated bias against minorities”, the editorial argues that what should concern the Indian government more is the “number of Indians leaving the country”. “During Modi’s time as PM, some 800,000 Indians have legally migrated to the US, with the Indian-origin population doubling to 2.7 million. Many more have entered illegally, as the hundred deported every week would suggest,” it says.</p>
