      <h1>Browns Player Has Brutally Honest Comment On QB Mason Rudolph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:13:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers benched Mason Rudolph during today’s 16-10 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. It is unclear whether he or Devlin Hodges will start against the Browns next weekend.</p>
      <p>At least one Cleveland player is hoping Rudolph keeps his job. Defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson was asked about Rudolph’s benching after the Browns’ game today.</p>
      <p>He pulled no punches with his response.</p>

      <p>Of course, the on-field confrontation between Rudolph and Myles Garrett drew all the main headlines when the Steelers and Browns played on November 14. However, the second-year QB played an abysmal game that evening.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was intercepted four times in Cleveland’s 21-7 win. No wonder Richardson wants him in there so badly.</p>
      <p>We’ll see how Pittsburgh’s quarterback situation unfolds as the week goes on. Hodges has played impressively in limited duty this season.</p>
      <p>The Steelers and Browns will play next Sunday at a 1 p.m. ET from Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.</p>
