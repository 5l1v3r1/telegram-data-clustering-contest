      <p>MUMBAI: Global beauty leader L’Oreal wants to double its business in India by 2022, said chairman and CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jean-Paul-Agon">Jean-Paul Agon</a>.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive interview with TOI, Agon said: “India was one of the most successful subsidiaries last year, and also in the first nine months of this year. We are gaining market share here and growing faster than the market.”</p>
      <p>The 27-billion-euro major’s Rs 4,300-crore Indian subsidiary, which has completed 25 years and forms 2% of its global business, has emerged as the fastest-growing market for the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/French">French</a> company. The personal care company owns brands like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Maybelline">Maybelline</a>, L’ Oreal Paris, Garnier, Kerastase and Kiehl’s.</p>
      <p>Agon said the company wants to double the number of consumers in India. “We are targeting about 100 million consumers today, and we think that in India we can at least reach another 100 million in the next 5-10 years. When you double the number of consumers, you more than double the business. We want to be 2x by 2022,” he said.</p>
      <p>Agon said the company has gained market leadership in hair colour and men’s cleansing and care, with value market shares of 28% and 30%, respectively. In <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/makeup">makeup</a>, however, L’ Oreal continues to be No.2 in India. While it is unusual for L’Oreal to not lead in makeup, Agon said the company is strengthening its position in the category in India. Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL’s) Lakme is the leading brand in makeup.</p>
      <p>“We are determined to gain market share in makeup in India, and become a leader one day as we are almost in every country of the world. Maybelline is the No. 1 makeup brand in almost every market in the world. So, I think that we have this perspective for India too,” said Agon. Agon said the company will compete through innovation, communication and digital play, and not by lowering prices.</p>
      <p>L’ Oreal, which does not have as strong a distribution reach as an HUL, is betting big on e-commerce to reach consumers across India. “One thing that is helping us reach consumers everywhere, is e-commerce. Distribution is no longer a limitation for us. Being a premium beauty company, it was difficult for us to go very deep in terms of distribution in small cities or remote regions compared to some other companies that sell products like detergents or soaps. With e-commerce, this limitation is gone. So, the barriers to distribution have been disappearing. It’s a great evolution for us,” Agon said.</p>
      <p>Though, with the emergence of digital, internet and e-commerce, there is rising entrepreneurship in beauty globally, Agon said big brands have only become bigger. “If you look at our last year’s results, or the first nine months of this year, our big brands have never been so powerful. So, what’s interesting is that in this new world, there are two phenomena taking place. You have more brands and a greater choice of small brands — but many of them staying small. And at the same time, you have big brands that are becoming more powerful. And in fact, the algorithms are favouring the big brands,” Agon said.</p>
      <p>L’Oreal grew 7.5% globally in the first nine months of this calendar year, which Agon described as “the company’s best since 2007”.</p>
