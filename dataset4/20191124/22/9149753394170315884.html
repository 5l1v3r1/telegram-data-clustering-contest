      <h1>This gaming laptop from Asus with a GTX 1650 is now just $580</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:33:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Just when you think <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">gaming laptops</a> with Nvidia's entry-level GTX 1650 graphics card can't get cheaper, it happens again. Only four days after an MSI laptop with the same GPU <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/this-msi-gaming-laptop-with-a-gtx-1650-is-just-dollar650-right-now/">dropped to $650</a>, another model from Asus is now on sale for $579.99 for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>The specifications in this model include an Intel Core i5-9300H processor, 8GB of RAM, a 512GB PCIe SSD (presumably with SATA speeds, not NVMe), an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card, stereo speakers, and an HD webcam. The screen is a 15.6-inch 1080p panel, though it's only 60Hzâ€”but did you really expect a 120 or 144Hz display at this price?</p>
      <p>The GTX 1650 is an entry-level graphics card, so while it's a major step up from Intel HD integrated graphics, you might have trouble playing some large-scale AAA titles. This laptop is best suited for games like Fortnite, The Sims, Overwatch, and other optimized titles. You can get a good idea for how it performs from our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-review/">review</a>.</p>
