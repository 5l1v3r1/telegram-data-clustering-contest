      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> were left "disgusted" as Ian Wright continuously burped during tonight's live trial.</p>
      <p>Ian, Caitlyn Jenner, James Haskell, Andrew Maxwell, Jacqueline Jossa, Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp took part in a Love Island themed trial to win a roast dinner for each campmate.</p>
      <p>Ian had to first bury his head in a pie which contained slime and cockroaches, but it appeared to get too much for him and he couldn't stop belching.</p>
