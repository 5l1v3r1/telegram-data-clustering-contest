      <p>Perhaps Unai Emery will one day be able to look back on Alexandre Lacazette’s 96th-minute equaliser to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/arsenal-vs-southampton-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">earn a 2-2 draw </a>against Southampton as the moment when he came through his biggest crisis to enjoy a lengthy and successful spell at Arsenal. Do not bet on it, though. The players hardly celebrated Lacazette’s goal, his second of the match, because they knew what was coming: more boos and more calls for their manager’s sacking.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have not won in the Premier League since Oct 6 and were outplayed on their own patch by a side in the relegation zone who had 21 shots to their 12 and could have won by three or four. Tony Adams lost no time afterwards in launching a fiery broadside at the Spaniard to add to the clamour.</p>
      <p>Emery, for his part, looked contrite and nervous, admitting that a big opportunity had been missed to “connect” with a disenchanted fan base, who have seen Arsenal go winless in six matches for the first time this millennium.</p>
      <p>Emery, bullied by the fans into reinstating Mesut Ozil and jettisoning Granit Xhaka, decided that picking a three-man defence and a midfield entirely made up of defensive-minded players was the best option against opponents who had not won at Arsenal since 1987.</p>
      <p>The result was instant chaos. Southampton had already gone close before Ryan Bertrand’s ninth-minute free-kick caught the defence dozing and Danny Ings ploughed into space on the left of the box to score via a post.</p>
      <p>Lacazette equalised nine minutes later, on the rebound and on the turn after Bertrand had blocked a shot from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the new club captain following Xhaka’s exile for swearing at booing fans last month.</p>

      <p>That proved to be a red herring, however, as Ralph Hasenhuttl’s strugglers, still smarting from the shame of last month’s 9-0 loss at home to Leicester City, continued to look comfortable.</p>
      <p>Emery changed his formation at the break. Off came Calum Chambers in a switch to a back four that saw Nicolas Pepe, the club’s record signing, added to the attack. Emery declared the next 20 minutes as Arsenal’s best of the season but they failed to produce a goal – and Southampton regained the lead through James Ward-Prowse, on the rebound from a saved penalty conceded in panic by Kieran Tierney.</p>
      <p>That sparked a frantic final 20 minutes that saw Southampton spurn a host of clear chances to wrap up victory, and Lacazette take advantage of a defensive lapse to claim an undeserved point.</p>
      <p>News of Norwich’s unexpected victory at Everton added to Southampton’s post-match gloom but they can take solace from the fact they looked nothing like a relegation team in this one. “In the position we are, people might mistake us as timid, or not up for the fight,” Ward-Prowse said. “But you could see against Arsenal that we have confidence in ourselves to play the way we want to play.”</p>
