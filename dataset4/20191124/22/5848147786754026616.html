      <h1>First comes Snapchat, then the Bachelor and Spinster ball</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:09:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/damien-cave/" target="_blank">Damien Cave</a></address>
      <p>They called it a wet T-shirt contest, but there were no winners or losers. Not many shirts, either.</p>
      <p>One man wore nothing but a tool belt, which no one seemed to mind even as the wettest and drunkest of the young and rural Australians – both women and men – tackled each other in the thick red mud, before arising for hugs.</p>
      <p>Two hours later, they appeared transformed: Black ties for the men, dresses for the women.</p>
      <p>The Ariah Park Bachelor and Spinster Ball had officially begun.</p>
      <p>After all, 1500 people didn’t drive forever to this tiny town (population 493) just for giggles. They were searching for love.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we’re here to meet people,” said Emme Williams, 22, a veterinary student who walked the fairgrounds in denim shorts with a few girlfriends before arriving at the ball wearing white.</p>
      <p>“I prefer the ones that don’t yell at you. The ones who want to have a conversation.”</p>

      <p>In cities, courtship has become efficient to excess.</p>
      <p>Tinder and other apps can bring intimacy faster than food delivery.</p>
      <p>But for people trying to meet and mate across Australia’s vast distances, it takes more planning and patience.</p>
      <p>Bachelor and Spinster balls – or B&amp;S balls, a fixture in the country since the 1880s with about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Countrybns/photos/a.2616186245079051/2616334255064250/?type=3&amp;theater">30 each year</a> – aim to help.</p>
      <p>And they are increasingly the catalyst for a matchmaking hybrid that combines the digital with the raw, communal and real.</p>
      <p>The interaction starts online, with friends posting photos and descriptions of their friends in a singles Facebook group before each ball; Williams was featured scantily clad except for the wool of a freshly shorn sheep.</p>
      <p>The lucky ones move on to flirting via Snapchat.</p>

      <p>But then real-life socialising takes over.</p>
      <p>All weekend at Ariah Park, which is about a five-hour drive west of Sydney, phones largely remained out of sight so eager was everyone for eye-to-eye contact.</p>

      <p>“You’re limited to three single boys in your town, and you’re related to two of them,” said Ebony Worland, 25, one of the ball’s organisers.</p>
      <p>“These were built for single women and men to find love in the country, really.”</p>
      <p>Her own sister, Shelby Worland, 18, found a boyfriend at last year’s ball.</p>
      <p>Selling tickets this year – about $100 for food, booze and live music, plus a goody bag that included a condom – she explained that her path to coupledom began when someone named Lleyton Neven, a friend of friends, started messaging her on Snapchat.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He lived about an hour away and after he arrived in Ariah Park on Friday, when most ball-goers show up, he found an excuse to seek her out.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to actually meet, so I said my phone was dead and I asked if she could charge it,” Neven said. “And now here we are!”</p>
      <p>Wobbly with beer and affection, he kissed his beloved on the cheek. “One year together!”</p>
      <p>Not all stories from the balls end so happily.</p>
      <p>Just ask Rippy, aka Shane Anthony Williams (no relation to Emme Williams).</p>
      <p>He’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Photographer/Rippys-BNS-Photography-509238059467318/">the unofficial photographer</a> of the B&amp;S scene, a railroad worker with a shaved head and grey goatee who has been snapping pictures for no charge since 2009.</p>

      <p>On his <a href="https://akubra.com.au/pages/the-akubra-story">Akubra hat</a> (made famous outside Australia by <i>Crocodile Dundee</i>), he carries cattle tags imprinted with the names and dates of B&amp;S balls, along with others marking specific memories.</p>
      <p>One commemorates a ball regular named Ezra who died at 19 in a car accident; another recalls a woman he knew from the balls who jumped to her death from a cliff with her two-year-old child.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard finding love,” Rippy said, noting that his wife of 30 years was somewhere nearby.</p>
      <p>“I’d hate to be single again. It’s scary, dead set.”</p>
      <p>But that’s why the balls matter, he added.</p>
      <p>Along with the awkward singles, the free-flowing beer and the backfiring  utes, turned on and off to create fiery explosions called key bangs, there are people who connected at balls and come back to socialise.</p>
      <p>“Who here is a couple?” Rippy yelled, meandering through the crowd.</p>
      <p>Within a minute, Jess and Matt Chown emerged. He works on sheep farms; she works at an aged-care home for veterans.</p>

      <p>“We met at a ball in 2011,” Jess Chown said. “I laid eyes on him and it was love at first sight.”</p>
      <p>“You know why I come? To do things I can’t do in church,” Matt Chown said.</p>
      <p>Standing at least 6-foot-3 and wider than a tree cut for timber, he kicked a trash bin, making a loud clang.</p>
      <p>Everyone laughed, including his wife.</p>
      <p>Jess Chown, 30, noted that they were all part of a group, “the Rummed-up Rednecks,” that convenes on Facebook and at balls.</p>
      <p>“It’s a way for us to let out our frustrations,” she said.</p>
      <p>Nearby, Emme Williams, the veterinary student, scanned the crowd for a bachelor.</p>
      <p>After a man offering her flowers moved on, one of her friends, Stephanie Papulia, 22, pointed to a guy in an expensive new vehicle.</p>

      <p>“He’s got a LandCruiser and a mullet,” Papulia said. “Ticks both boxes.”</p>
      <p>Williams pointed to another ute with large antennas. “The bigger the aerial,” she said, “the more he’s overcompensating”.</p>
      <p>Most of the men at Ariah Park were more “chivalrous,” they said, than their behaviour might suggest.</p>
      <p>But some of the balls in other towns have been dangerous.</p>
      <p>In 2017, two men were <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/victorian-b-s-ball-rapists-jailed/82df7290-d3bd-4289-a6be-28b9491f6fed">convicted of raping a woman</a> at a ball in another state.</p>
      <p>Another man was <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5264723/man-appeals-jail-sentence-after-two-sexual-assaults-at-bs-ball/">sentenced</a> to 18 months in prison last year for sexually assaulting two women at the <a href="https://eelskinnersbns.com/">Eel Skinners and Duck Pluckers B&amp;S.</a></p>
      <p>In Ariah Park, security staff members walked the fairgrounds continuously.</p>
      <p>At the ball, held under the stars after dark, the main problem seemed to be food dye.</p>
      <p>No one could explain why, but for years, attendees have felt compelled to spit dye onto each other.</p>
      <p>The rules against bringing it in were generally ignored. Every few minutes, someone was hauled off after being caught with dye.</p>

      <p>Glitter, though, was allowed. It floated in the breeze, destined to stay in mullets forever.</p>
      <p>And as was the case all day, the ball itself captured the silly, lonely and romantic.</p>
