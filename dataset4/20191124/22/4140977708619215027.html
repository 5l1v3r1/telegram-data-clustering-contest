            <b>RJS Vs MAH Dream11 Team And Match Report: Time running out for bottom placed Rajasthan after two defeats on the bounce</b>
          </p>
          <p>The only side in Group A of the Super League stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy to have failed to win a single match after the early exchanges of this ongoing round, for Rajasthan, the ordeal has been a very real one. The side find themselves slumped in bottom spot of the group, a position they befittingly occupy with their displays seeing them being berated and smeared by their ardent supporters.</p>
          <p>Although the side have managed to take things close in both of ther matches, the truth s that the side were never in any of either of those encounters. After losing a high scoring thriller to Baroda in their first tie, the side ended up slumping to a four wicket defeat against Haryana in their foregone contest as the side were putdown in a low scoring contest this time around.</p>

                <p>Managing to muster up just 123 as their top-order shambolically collapsed yet again, the target strung up by their bats was always going to be too tricky for their bats to defend. And despite their best efforts as their bowling unit should resolve, will and vigour, the side’s fight and character was rendered redundant as Rajasthan ended up winning with over 4 overs to spare.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, Maharastra’s come into today’s clash finding themselves in fourth place in the points tally with the side having sealed a behemoth of a win over Baroda the last time around. It was a win which could end up being a defining moment in the side’s season as they walked all over Baroda, making light work of them by 67 runs as they sent ther opponents packing for just 97 after raking up 165 whilst batting first.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>An exemplary wicket for the bats, we are bound to be in for a run feast when this match gets underway. The bounce on the ball is just right to allow batsmen all the time and space in the world to crunch the ball to the fence with the side winning the toss set to come out and bat first over here and put the pressure on the opponents with a momentous target.</p>

                            <h3>RJS Vs MAH Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Although Manender Sigh comes way too down Rajasthan’s batting order, the way has still found himself being serenaded with ample overs to come out and get a flurry of runs and show his mettle given the top-order collapses his side have been subjected to. We envisage this being yet another match where he’ll get time in abundance in the middle and given his ability to capitalise on the death overs, we are moving in for him here.</p>
                            <h3>RJS Vs MAH Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Across this ongoing instalment of the frontier tournamnet, whenever Maharastra’s have been in player, there have been two bats from the side who have been indispensible to our cause. It’s the indomitable and daunting partnership of Rahul Tripathi and Ruturaj Gaikwad, two players who have divulged us in scintillating displays.</p>
                            <p>With 375 runs in 9 matches, Gaikwad has emerged as the leading run getter for his to make him a regulation pick while we have an akin dup being rolled in from the opposition as well. With 228 runs, Ankit Lumba heir top run scorer makes an instant entry into our side alongside Arjit Gupta who has amassed to fill his gloves with 161 runs.</p>
                            <h3>RJS Vs MAH Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Kedar Jadhav’s imperious displays in the tournamnet have seen him earn his spot back in India’s squad for the side’s upcoming ODI and T20 series with the player managing to regain is touch. He’s come up with 212 runs which have more importantly come at crucial junctures to see the player come into our side without any perusal with spinner Shamshuzama Kazi joining him. </p>
                            <h3>RJS Vs MAH Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Give the way Rajasthan have made for a tepid, bleak and meek batting unit, we envision this being another encounter where they’ll be shrouded in a tussle. The side have been left miffed by their top-order with side’s finding it too easy to maul them to see us go in with a trivalent of selections from Maharashtra. </p>
                            <p>Satyajeet Bachhav is our first pick with the player leading the ranks of his side’s wicket taker with 13 wickets in 9 matches. The duo of Azim Kazi and 11 wicket man Samad Fallah will partner him up while from the other side of the section we have decided to opt for Khaleel Ahmed who has managed to snag 10 wickets.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Gaikwad will lead our side out as the captain while Bachhav is our vice-captain.</p>
