      <p>An unexpected jungle spat broke out between two of I'm A Celebrity's most mild-mannered contestants on Sunday night and it was all down to the latest Dingo Dollar Challenge.</p>
      <p>After completing the challenge itself - which saw Kate Garraway get pelted with powder paint - she and Roman Kemp headed to the kiosk to discover they had a choice of jelly beans or salted nuts. They chose jelly beans.</p>
      <p>Kiosk Kev called the celebrities back in<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here"> I'm A Celebrity's</a> Main Camp and Andrew Whyment answered the phone.  The question was ‘What % of adults do not trust politicians?’ A-59% or B-79%"</p>
      <p>Adele thought it would be 79%, Andrew thought lower. Jacqueline said nobody trusts any politicians. </p>
      <p>Coronation Street actor Andrew felt it was 59%, James asked for a show of hands any most of the celebrities thought 79% so James told Andrew to say that, to which he retorted “Not everyone put their hands up," only for James to snap back straight away, saying“they did’.”</p>
      <p>Andrew walked away in a huff, declaring “It’s just as shambolic as ever, we’re not getting chocolate.”</p>
      <p>Later the camp still discussed the tension over the phone call, Cliff told Andrew to “Let it go” and sang it in the style of Disney’s Frozen.</p>
      <p>Andrew wanted more time to debate the question.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph James said “Everyone’s tired, everyone’s a bit chippy, everyone’s had a long day, things happen.  I’m just mortified if he (Andrew) think I just closed him down.”</p>
      <p>Heading to the Telegraph himself, Andrew said “I said my piece, everyone said their piece and big James gave me a hug, job done.”</p>
      <p>Roman and Kate came back and revealed they’d all won jelly beans, everyone cheered and Andrew reacted “Thank God for Adele, thank God people didn’t listen to me.”</p>
