      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> think Andrew Maxwell will be the first celebrity voted out.</p>
      <p>The comedian <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-viewers-baffled-as-andrew-maxwell-clashes-with-james-haskell-and-ian-wright/">caused a stir during Sunday night's show as he clashed with James Haskell and Ian Wright</a>.</p>
      <p>Andrew first fell out with James over the Dingo Dollar challenge question which was: "What percentage of adults do not trust politicians?"</p>

      </p>
      <p>The answers were either 59% or 79%, and Andrew believed it was the lower number.</p>
      <p>James then asked for a show of hands who thought it was 79% and the majority agreed, so they chose that as their answer.</p>
      <p>Andrew said: "Not everyone put their hands up," to which James snapped: "They did. You didn't look! You're looking at me."</p>
      <p>Walking away, Andrew said: "It’s just as shambolic as ever, we’re not getting chocolate."</p>
      <p>Pulling Andrew aside, James then apologised for "snapping" at him and they hugged it out.</p>

      <p>Andrew later clashed with Ian as he accused the former footballer of "singling him out".</p>
      <p>Ian denied Andrew's claims and the comedian later apologised to Ian and said he was just "knackered".</p>
      <aside>"Please can Andrew be the first to be voted off.</aside>
      <p>Viewers were divided over the clash with many going against Andrew.</p>
      <p>Some have even predicted he will become the first star voted out of the jungle.</p>
      <p>One person said: "What is wrong with Andrew. Please be voted out first! So awkward to watch!"</p>
