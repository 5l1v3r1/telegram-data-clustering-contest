          <b>READ: Former PSOJ president Beverly Lopez has died</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>She was president of the Jamaica Exporters’ Association when she was lured to the Hilton Hotel in New Kingston by a man with a British accent, who claimed to be a journalist wanting to interview her.</p>
      <p>When Lopez arrived at the hotel, she was overpowered by the man and a female accomplice, who drugged and robbed her, tried to extort money from her and left her tied up.</p>
      <p>Lopez was one of a number of persons similarly attacked, in what was later unearthed as a scam involving a team of individuals. Lopez’s male abductor was later caught, prosecuted and imprisoned.</p>
      <p>As president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, in 2005, she led the resounding call for politicians to publicly sever ties with criminal associates, and dismantle their garrisons, delivering a three-week ultimatum to political representatives to renounce their connections with gunmen and other lawbreakers, or face the possibility of being voted out of office.</p>
