      <p>And thank goodness an agreement was found because she rocked the stage singing “The Man”, “Lover”, “Blank Space”, “Shake It Off”, “Love Story” and “I Knew You Were Trouble”.</p>

      <p>“When I fell in love with music it was when I realized an artist can transcend for many genres,” Swift said while thanking Carole King.</p>
      <p>“All that matters to me is the memories I have with you guys, the fans,” she added.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the night, Swift also won for Favourite Pop/Rock Album where she thanked the people she made the album with calling it “a new beginning” before saying that she “really loves her record label”. It also meant that Swift now holds the most wins at the AMAs with 25, beating Michael Jackson’s record of 24.</p>
