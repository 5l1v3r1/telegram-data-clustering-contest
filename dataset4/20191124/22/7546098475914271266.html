      <h1>Westpac shares on watch as AUSTRAC scandal builds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:17:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p><b>Westpac Banking Corp </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> shares are on watch this morning after the latest development in its AUSTRAC scandal.</p>
      <h3>What’s the latest on Westpac’s AUSTRAC scandal?</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/apra-joins-westpac-pursuit-heads-might-roll-treasurer-20191124-p53di1">an article in the <i>Australian Financial Review </i>(AFR)</a>, APRA is now looking into Westpac’s AUSTRAC scandal.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has said senior management should be under scrutiny following last week’s revelations.</p>
      <p>Westpac is the latest bank to be caught up in an AUSTRAC money laundering scandal after <b>Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-CBA/">(ASX: CBA)</a> in 2018. In that instance, the bank and the financial agency <a href="https://www.austrac.gov.au/austrac-and-cba-agree-700m-penalty">reached a $700 million penalty settlement in June</a>.</p>
      <p>Westpac shares plummeted 6.56% to $24.77 per share following the breaking of the AUSTRAC scandal last week. <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/22/westpac-unreservedly-apologises-for-its-aml-ctf-breaches/">The Aussie bank “unreservedly” apologised</a> following the news, as it looks to urgently improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding systems.</p>
      <p>CEO Brian Hartzer is facing pressure to step down as Westpac scrambles to contain the fallout from the AUSTRAC scandal.</p>
      <h3>What’s APRA got to do with it?</h3>
      <p>AUSTRAC’s legal action against Westpac last week kicked things off and it looks like APRA could wade in this week.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg said APRA may look at disqualifying the Westpac board in the wake of the money laundering scandal, which has been linked to offshore child exploitation.</p>
      <p>APRA has the powers to disqualify boards and executives under legislation that “came into force in 2018,” said Mr Frydenberg.</p>
      <p>APRA has the power to fine banks and can apply to the court for fines of up to $500 million. The Westpac share price could be under pressure this morning, as investors work to re-value the company’s shares ahead of potential financial damages.</p>
      <p>Any leadership changes stemming from the AUSTRAC scandal could also put Westpac shares under pressure throughout the week.</p>
      <p>It’s the latest turn in an up and down year for the Aussie banking sector, which has shareholders asking questions.</p>
