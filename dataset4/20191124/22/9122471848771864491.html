      <h1>Video: LSU QB Joe Burrow Is Excited For Saturday Night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:12:15+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>LSU’s football program appears to be excited for Saturday night’s game against Texas A&amp;M. The Tigers have already secured a spot in the SEC Championship Game, though this weekend’s contest against the Aggies will be personal.</p>
      <p>The 2018 edition of the LSU-Texas A&amp;M game was wild, with the Aggies winning in seven overtimes. Emotions <a href="https://thespun.com/news/lsu-texas-am-just-had-the-craziest-ending-of-the-season">were flying on the field following that game, too</a>.</p>
      <p>Ed Orgeron made it clear that the Tigers will be better this time around.</p>
      <p>“There’s no question. There’s no question about that,” Orgeron said after LSU’s win over Arkansas. “It’s going to be on.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll never forget that game last year. We’re going to be ready.”</p>
      <p>Joe Burrow appears to be excited, too.</p>

      <p>Of course, Texas A&amp;M fans will point out that LSU scored 70 points in last year’s game <i>and lost</i>. We imagine that wouldn’t be the case this year, but who knows what’ll happen when these two teams meet on the field.</p>
      <p>LSU and Texas A&amp;M are set to kick off at 7 p.m. E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on ESPN.</p>
