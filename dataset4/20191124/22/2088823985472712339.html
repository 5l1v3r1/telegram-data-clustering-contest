      <p>GLENS FALLS – The Class D girls volleyball final came down to depth, and Candor had more than Panama.</p>
      <p>The Indians swept Panama with set scores of 25-11, 25-20, 25-13 in the New York State Public High School Athletic Association title game Sunday at Cool Insuring Arena. It was the third consecutive state final loss for Panama, the 2016 Class D champion.</p>
      <p>Not only did Candor – which won its first state title since 2003 – put three players on the Class D all-tournament team, it had a fourth who did her fair share of damage.</p>
      <p>“All their hitters were a problem,” Panama coach Tammy Hosier said. “They have three hitters up in the front, we have one strong one. They definitely out-attacked us.”</p>
      <p>The Panthers’ two middle blockers, seniors Kylie Schnars and Natalie Angeletti, each had eight kills and made the all-tournament team. But Panama didn’t have an answer for Candor’s all-tournament team selections Megan Henry, Jennah Kareem and tournament MVP and setter Braelyn Hornick.</p>
      <p>Along with that group, Candor sophomore outside hitter Shelby Swartz had multiple kills and blocks in the first set.</p>
      <p>“All of them are such strong hitters, and we knew that coming into the game,” Angeletti said. “We didn’t play our best and they really hit well.</p>
      <p>“We were not playing defense well and they were doing great on offense. We were just really struggling to get their hits up.”</p>
      <p>Panama tended to play better early in the sets and held leads in the first two. While it rallied to close the leads, it could never earn the big point that would have produced a tie score when needed.</p>
      <p>“We just eventually sort of fell apart,” Angeletti said. “We went on our own small, little runs. They were kinda short-lived.”</p>
      <p>“We’d have some great hits and they were digging them,” Hosier said. “What got us here is we’re more of an offensive team and we ended up on the defensive side. They hit straight down at us.”</p>
      <p>As for digs, Marra Hovey and Ally Finnerty each had six for Panama, with Mandy Brink adding five. Offensively, setter Maddie Johnson finished with 15 assists.</p>
      <p>Angeletti is grateful for the run Panama has had over her career and now turns her attention to basketball. She has signed to play basketball at Daemen College.</p>
      <p>“Just to be a part of this team and go so far,” she said, “we’re so blessed to have each other.”</p>
