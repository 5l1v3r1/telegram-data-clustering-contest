      <p>Fittingly, this announcement comes as <i>The Walking Dead</i> Season 10 airs its <a href="https://screenrant.com/walking-dead-midseason-10-finale-ending-dante-death-explained/">mid-season finale</a>, titled, "The World Before." Based on the Image Comics series of the same name, <i>The Walking Dead</i> first premiered on AMC in 2010. <i>World Beyond</i> is its second spinoff, following <i>Fear the Walking Dead</i>, which debuted in 2015.</p>
      <p>Set ten years after the beginning of <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s zombie outbreak, <i>World Beyond</i> follows the next generation of survivors -- who never truly knew a life before the apocalypse and have grown up in a less immediately dangerous wasteland than the ones their elders had to traverse. Described as a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-spinoff-series-post-apocalyptic-stand-by-me/">"post-apocalyptic Stand By Me</a>, the show finds its teenage protagonists leaving the safety of their homes to venture out into the unforgiving world around them.</p>
