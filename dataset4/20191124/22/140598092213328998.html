      <p>There is one quality above all others that distinguishes Wolverhampton Wanderers from those clubs around them of a similar stature: consistency. While the likes of Everton and West Ham search for a way out of their respective messes, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side are quietly moving towards another hugely impressive season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/wolves-move-fifth-impressive-victory-away-bournemouth/">Saturday’s win at Bournemouth</a> stretched their unbeaten league run to eight games, their longest top-flight sequence since 1974.</p>
      <p>They are almost assured of their progression in the Europa League ahead of Thursday’s visit to SC Braga in Portugal, and Raul Jimenez’s winner at the Vitality Stadium places him level with Raheem Sterling with 14 goals in all competitions.</p>
      <p>This trajectory is all the more impressive when you consider that this was their 25th fixture and that they have fielded only 18 different players, a joint league low with Burnley and Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Nuno knows exactly what he is going to get from each member of his squad and that synthesis and organisation was again in evidence at Bournemouth, where they were fully deserving of their victory.</p>

      <p>Joao Moutinho and Jimenez were again excellent, with the former scoring his first goal since September 2018. He, Adama Traore and Diogo Jota are all in the Premier League top 10 when it comes to assists. Moutinho has created an impressive 24 chances in total, including the one which led to Jimenez’s goal at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>How Eddie Howe must wish he could call on such a settled side. Injuries and suspensions are taking their toll on Bournemouth, who conversely have just one win in eight heading into a daunting set of pre-Christmas fixtures which includes Liverpool and Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The Bournemouth manager was heartened by the “spirit, determination and fight” his team showed in the second half in the face of a two-goal deficit and with a man down following Simon Francis’s 36th-minute dismissal.</p>
      <p>“It’s a huge frustration for me to hear those figures because, with all those games, if I cast my mind back, we could probably have won all of them,” Howe said.</p>
      <p>“The fact we’ve only won one isn’t good enough. It’s something we’ll work hard to put right and we’ve got to do it quickly.”</p>
