      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> were left divided as Andrew Maxwell clashed with James Haskell and Ian Wright tonight.</p>
      <p>The comedian first fell out with James after Kate Garraway and Roman Kemp won the Dingo Dollar challenge and had to choose whether to bring back jelly beans or salted nuts to the camp.</p>
      <p>They chose jelly beans and the campmates in main camp had to answer the question: "What percentage of adults do not trust politicians?"</p>

      </p>
      <p>The answers were either 59% or 79%.</p>
      <p>Adele Roberts thought it would be 79% however Andrew thought it was lower.</p>
      <p>James then asked for a show of hands who thought it was 79% and the majority agreed.</p>
      <p>He told Andy Whyment to tell Kiosk Kev that answer.</p>

      <p>Andrew said: "Not everyone put their hands up," to which James snapped: "They did. You didn't look! You're looking at me."</p>
      <p>Walking away, Andrew said: "It’s just as shambolic as ever, we’re not getting chocolate."</p>
      <aside>I’m confused, what did Ian actually do to Andrew?</aside>
      <p>Pulling Andrew aside, James then apologised for "snapping" at him.</p>
      <p>The pair hugged it out and moved on.</p>
      <p>Andrew later clashed with Ian as he accused the former footballer of "singling him out".</p>
