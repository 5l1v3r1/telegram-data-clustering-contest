      <p>Temperatures have dropped below freezing in many areas this<br/>evening. This may cause any moisture on untreated roads and<br/>walkways to freeze resulting in slippery conditions. If you will<br/>be out overnight, watch for icy patches on roads and sidewalks,<br/>especially over the higher elevations and in rural areas.</p>
