      <h1>Eric Dier explains why Tottenham are optimistic after Mauricio Pochettino sacking</h1>
      <h2>England midfielder Eric Dier couldn’t hide his excitement at being touched by the stardust of serial trophy hunter Jose Mourinho</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>If teams reflect their managers, Tottenham will become streetfighters and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> will go down.</p>
      <p>If you watched this match either live or on Match of the Day then you’ll know that this was a scoreline utterly unrepresentative of the gulf in class between these two teams. And Spurs didn’t even play that well.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho will almost certainly breathe new life and defensive stability back into his new team. His reputation as an elite manager for the current generation depends on it.</p>
      <p>With their 11-month Premier League away drought over, a place in the Champions League knockout stages is guaranteed with victory over Olympiakos on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>That should see the swagger start to come back to join the post-match music in the Spurs dressing room.</p>

      <p>Then Mourinho can work on making his choirboys nasty, cynical and able to build on the foundations left by Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>England midfielder Eric Dier couldn’t hide his excitement at being touched by the stardust of the serial trophy hunter.</p>
      <p>“His record is unbelievable,” said Dier. “It would be great if he could transmit that to us. When he speaks to us you can feel it.</p>
      <p>“You just believe, you know. So I hope we can win a lot of games and do as well as possible.</p>
      <p>“I think he is the perfect man to take over from Pochettino in my opinion. We are really happy he is here and hopefully he can help us win trophies.</p>

      <p>"We were trying to win them under Pochettino and will keep on trying to win them under Mourinho.”</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini, meanwhile, is toast. He might limp on for a few more games but he surely can’t last the season with West Ham - two places off the drop zone - playing like this.</p>
      <p>His Irons side would have been hammered had Spurs not taken their collective foot on the pedal at 3-0 up. The late goals flattered them. They are now winless in seven, losing five. They’ve now conceded three in each of their last three Premier League games. Good luck away to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> in their next two.</p>
      <p>Cold Pellegrini lacks the leadership or the charisma to convince the club’s fans that there is a way out of the abysmal form that has seen them fall like a stone since beating <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in September.</p>

      <p>The 66-year-old is starting to look like the proverbial Timex watch in a digital age.</p>
      <p>Captain Mark Noble was more lucid and hard-hitting with his analysis on Saturday night on Match of the Day. If only they could give him the job until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Then get Rafa. An older manager who can change with the times and build an actual relationship with a fanbase. West Ham have spent far, far too much money to be fighting relegation battles again.</p>
      <p>Clearly losing keeper Lukasz Fabianski hasn’t helped. But how did West Ham end up in a situation where their fate is in the hands of the worst Premier League keeper to pull on a pair of gloves for some time?</p>
      <p>Fabianski’s understudy Roberto was trending on social media by midway through the first half. Nobody inside the stadium or watching on TV could believe how bad he was.</p>

      <p>Actually, scratch that. West Ham fans were well aware. Brought in by Pellegrini’s mate, director of football Mario Husillos, Roberto has been poor for some time now.</p>
      <p>It is hard even to blame him. Pellegrini is paid handsomely to have the 33-year-old Spaniard better prepared to step in than this.</p>
      <p>Instead Roberto lacked presence, authority and allowed a Son Heung-min shot heading straight for him to find the back of the net as Spurs opened the scoring. His uncertainty transmitted itself to his defence which gave up the ghost almost immediately. Lucas Moura and Harry Kane cashed in. Game over.</p>
      <p>Forget those late goals from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna. Spurs had already clocked off.</p>
      <p>Dismissive Pellegrini wouldn’t even discuss his keeper afterwards. He can only keep his head in the sand for so long.</p>
