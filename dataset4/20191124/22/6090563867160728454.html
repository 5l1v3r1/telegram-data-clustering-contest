      <p>Two Bulawayo men allegedly broke into a foreign currency dealer’s car and stole R20 000, $400 and airtime recharge cards worth $2 000 after smashing a rear window.</p>
      <p>Nigel Zulu (37) and his accomplice Nigel Matengo (29) allegedly broke into Milani Chidende’s car at Entumbane Complex and stole the cash and recharge cards.</p>
      <p>The duo pleaded not guilty to theft from a motor vehicle before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu.</p>
      <p>They were remanded to December 6 on $500 bail each.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Zulu and Matengo took advantage of Chidende’s absence and smashed the rear left quarter glass of the car with an unknown object before ransacking his vehicle.</p>
      <p>For the State, Mr Stewart Madzore said on July 9 this year, at Entumbane Complex, Zulu and Matengo broke into Mr Chidende’s car and stole a bag containing cash and recharge cards.</p>
      <p>He said the duo was arrested after Mr Fadson Nhawu and Mr Knowledge Tsiga were traced and found to have recharged their respective mobile phones using the stolen cards.</p>
      <p>Mr Madzore said Mr Nhawu revealed that he received the juice cards from Zulu who was later arrested together with Matengo.</p>
