            <b>BRD Vs HAR Dream11 And Match Report: Group A toppers Baroda look to recover from their last defeat and continue in their upward spiral.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Things began immaculately for Baroda in Group A of the Super League of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with the side winning two straight matches but the last encounter clipped their wins and acted as a massive determent to their aspirations of hammering down first place. It was not just the defeat but rather the unsavoury manner in which it came about which left the side stunned, a result they’ll be looking to turnaround come today’s encounter.</p>
          <p>Allowing Maharashtra to make 165 while batting first, Baroda’s batting might and strength should have made this encounter a close fought encounter. Instead, it was anything but with the side being wiped the floor with as they were walked all over to cut short their run chase at a mere 98 runs to see the side plummet to a 67 run defeat.</p>

                <p>With the gaping holes prevelant in the side being exploited, Haryana will step out looking to capitalise on them when the two outfits meet today as the side look to snap at Baroda’s heels and throw their own hat into the reckoning for first place. Currently in third with a four wicket win against Rajasthan after they chased down the 142 run target infront of them with ease, the side are coming into this having garnered immense momentum, one they’ll be looking to build on in this clash as well.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>A tatter of a surface to bat on, this wicket will only further regress and wane given the fact that this is the second match of the day to be played over here within the space of a few hours. We envisage this encounter to be a los scorer with the team winning the toss choosing to chase and get a clear and cohesive idea of how to traverse their run chase.</p>
