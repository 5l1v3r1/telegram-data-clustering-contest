      <h1>South African Airways welcomes the third Airbus A350-900 to its fleet</h1>

      <p>South African Airways on Saturday took delivery of its first brand new and third Airbus A350-900 aircraft.</p>
      <p>Flown in from Hamburg, Germany this weekend with <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/SAA4273/22f21745">flight number SA4273</a>, the plane is the first totally new A350 sub-leased by the airline from Air Mauritius.</p>
      <p>The plane, sporting <a href="https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/9520193">tail number ZS-SDE</a>, landed at Johannesburg’s OR Tambo International around 10.45pm SAST.</p>

      <p>South African Airways <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/07/saa-airbus-a350-900-planes/">first announced</a> that it would add four A350-900 planes to its fleet in July. <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/saa-a350-airbus/">Two have already been delivered</a>, with the final A350-900 set to join its fleet before year-end.</p>
      <p>The new twin-engine planes will be deployed on the Johannesburg OR Tambo to New York JFK route, replacing its much older and less efficient quad-engine A340-600s.</p>
      <p>South African Airways will lease the A350s for three years.</p>
      <p>ZS-SDE’s arrival comes days after <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/saa-flights-operating-strike/">a disruptive week-long strike</a> by the airline’s staff came to an end. A number of flights resumed on Saturday, according to data from FlightRadar24.</p>
