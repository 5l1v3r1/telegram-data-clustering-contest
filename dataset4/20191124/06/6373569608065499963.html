      <p>Joe Edwards owned up to forgetting about a promise he made to his wife after he scored one of the goals for Plymouth Argyle in their 2-1 win against Bradford City.</p>
      <p>Edwards was on target for <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> as they made it four wins out of their last five League Two games.</p>
      <p>His wife, Hannah, gave birth to twin baby boys – Archie and Louie – on October 28.</p>
      <p>Edwards had promised he would celebrate scoring a goal for Argyle with a rocking motion with his arms, as seen done by many footballers over the years.</p>
      <p>However, he admitted he had been too excited after putting the Pilgrims 2-0 up in the first half.</p>
      <p>Edwards said: “It was a pleasing goal and something that I can dedicate to my two boys who have recently been born, which is nice to do.</p>
      <p>“I was supposed to do a celebration, which I forgot. I was too excited at the time, and Danny (Mayor) grabbed me.</p>
      <p>“I can only apologise to my Missus for that one. She asked me to do that one thing and I didn’t do it.”</p>
      <p>Edwards was asked whether he thought he would be forgiven and replied: “I’m not sure.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m hoping so. She has already text saying ‘Well done’ so she will be happy I have scored.”</p>
      <p>Argyle had taken the lead as early as the fifth minute with a goal from striker Byron Moore.</p>
      <p>Edwards then doubled their advantage in the 25th minute with a fine low left finish from the edge of the Bradford box.</p>

      <p>The chance came after Edwards closed down City goalkeeper Richard O’Donnell and forced him into a poor, rushed clearance.</p>
      <p>The ball only went as far as Argyle striker Joel Grant and his pass to Edwards set him up for his shot into the net.</p>
      <p>Edwards said: “We had worked on pressing and making sure we put them (Bradford) on the back foot, and we did that.</p>
      <p>“For some reason I ended up pressing the goalkeeper and it paid off. I was in the box and managed to score.</p>
      <p>“I think just overall at the moment in training if you are the nearest man to the ball you have got to press whether it’s your man or not.</p>
      <p>“You have got to make sure you are on the front foot and I ended up being there. It forced them into a mistake and it led to a goal for us, which was great.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s victory over Bradford, who arrived at Home Park in third position in the table, came seven days after their 1-0 win at leaders Forest Green Rovers.</p>
      <p>Edwards said: “We have had two massive games now against teams at the top of the league and we have come away with six points, which is fantastic.</p>
      <p>“It’s something we have really worked hard on the last couple of weeks, knowing these two games were coming up.</p>
      <p>“It was massive to put in the performances and get the victories.”</p>
      <p>He went on: “We know on our day we can beat these teams but at the start of the year we lacked that consistency a little bit, which was frustrating.</p>
      <p>“I feel now we are working well as a team and everyone is on the same page now. It’s showing in the performances and definitely in the results.”</p>
      <p>Prior to beating Forest Green and Bradford, Argyle also won 1-0 away to League One outfit Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round.</p>
      <p>Yet, before that tie, they had suffered a humiliating 4-0 Devon Derby defeat away to Exeter City.</p>
      <p>Edwards admitted he and his team-mates knew that they owed the Green Army some good results after that debacle.</p>

      <p>He said: “It was a tough one because we were in good form before the game. When you perform like we did, it was frustrating for everyone and especially the fans.</p>
      <p>“We knew then we had to do something that would get them back on side and show that we really do care and it was just a one-off.</p>
      <p>“We needed to show that we mean business and I think we have done the last three games.</p>
      <p>“That (the Exeter defeat) will hopefully be put to the side now and we can concentrate on looking forward.”</p>
      <p>After having much the better of the first half, Argyle came under pressure at the start of the second period.</p>
      <p>Bradford changed tactics to match up to the Pilgrims after a double substitution and their deficit was reduced to 2-1 in the 51st minute by an own goal from Niall Canavan.</p>
      <p>He redirected a low cross from former Argyle defender Anthony O’Connor into his own net.</p>

      <p>Edwards said: “We played really well in the first half and maybe could have been a bit further in front.</p>
      <p>“Two-nil is a risky scoreline sometimes. When you get that early goal you fear they are going to throw everything at you.</p>
      <p>“I thought we played well after their goal. We got back into the game and had a few more chances.</p>
      <p>“It was a good game overall and we are glad to come away with three points.”</p>
