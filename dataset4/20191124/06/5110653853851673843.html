      <p>Nashville Predators winger Viktor Arvidsson could miss some time because ofa play by St. Louis Blues defenseman Robert Bortuzzo that had the NHL's Department of Player Safety almost immediately scheduling a hearing.</p>
      <p>With the Predators forechecking during the first period Saturday, Arvidssoncrashed the net and went looking for a rebound in front of St. Louis goalie Jordan Binnington. In response, Bortuzzo cross-checked Arvidsson into the net. Arvidsson's head hit the crossbar before he fell to the ice.</p>

      <p>With Arvidsson still down and trying to get up, Bortuzzo delivered another cross-check. Arvidsson hit the ice again. He eventually made it to his feet before receiving another shot from Binnington.</p>

      <p>Arvidsson left the game and did not return. Preds coach Peter Laviolette did not provide an update on Arvidsson's status following the team's 4-2 victory, but he<a href="https://twitter.com/1025TheGame/status/1198455817542029312?s=20">told reporters</a>he believed Bortuzzo's play was"dirty."</p>
      <p>Bortuzzo's hearing will take place Sunday. The 30-year-old bluelinerdoes have a history of suspensions: He was suspended for two games in 2014 for a high hit on Jaromir Jagr, who didn't have the puck on his stick, and he was suspended for the Blues' final two preseason games and season opener in 2018 for a hit to the head ofMichal Kempny.</p>
      <p>Arvidsson, 26, has six goals and 14 points in 22 games for Nashville this season. Bortuzzo has registered one assist through 11 games for St. Louis.</p>
