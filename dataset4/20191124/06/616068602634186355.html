        <b>OVERVIEW</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many feel that time is of the essence as decisions are coming down to the wire. Follow a path that resonates with your inner core beliefs.</p>
      <p>If in doubt, check your concerns with a wise adviser you respect. </p>
      <p>Be ready to drive your plans in a certain direction. Do not engage with those who oppose or challenge you.</p>
      <p>They are just potholes in the road to your larger distinction. Travel light. The less you say, the less you will have to recover later.</p>
      <p>Avoid accidents or dangerous areas. The new moon in Sagittarius on Tuesday adds an air of optimism; seek out positive people.</p>
      <p>A meeting of the minds develops into something more. Nice.<br/><br/><b>ARIES:</b> Be patient with how long it takes for changes to be implemented. Time works for you now.<br/><br/><b>TAURUS:</b> Take charge independently if others are not up to speed. There is a process to follow.<br/><br/><b>GEMINI:</b> New or renewed talks lead to a change in personal or business relationships. It’s hopeful.<br/><br/><b>CANCER:</b> Your intensity can be overwhelming to others as they need time to think before speaking.<br/><br/><b>LEO</b>: Consider all options personally or on the job. It could require a change if you are willing to.<br/><br/><b>VIRGO:</b> An unexpected source can provide information that you can use to get the best results.<br/><br/><b>LIBRA</b>: What you say or do becomes a prototype for others to follow, making things flow easily.<br/><br/><b>SCORPIO:</b> Speak or lay out plans in a direct and clear manner so those waiting can run with it.<br/><br/><b>SAGITTARIUS:</b> You can successfully change up the way you present yourself in the new moon.<br/><br/><b>CAPRICORN</b>: Silence is golden with the level of control you have behind the scenes. Act on it.<br/><br/><b>AQUARIUS:</b> You can assume a leadership role of sorts even if it is not officially announced yet.<br/><br/><b>PISCES</b>: You inform or entertain as others look to you for direction. Get them together to chat.</p>
