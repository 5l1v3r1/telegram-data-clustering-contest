        <b>STRANGE GAME</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yale and Harvard students poured out of the stands together at halftime in a climate change protest that delayed the 136th edition of The Game for about an hour.</p>
      <p>When the fans stormed back onto the field at the end, it was only the Yalies, and they were celebrating this time.</p>
      <p>Kurt Rawlings threw two touchdown passes in the final 88 seconds of regulation to rally Yale from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit and beat Harvard 50-43 in two overtimes, one of the strangest editions of The Game in its 144 years of history.</p>
      <p>Following a halftime sit-in by a couple hundred protesters who occupied midfield for about an hour before being peacefully escorted off by police, the Bulldogs celebrated a conference title in darkness 15 minutes after sunset in the unlit, 105-year-old Yale Bowl.</p>
