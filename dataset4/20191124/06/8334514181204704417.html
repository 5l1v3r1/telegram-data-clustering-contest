      <p>(Reuters) - Deontay Wilder retained his WBC heavyweight title on Saturday with a seventh round knock-out of challenger Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>In a repeat of their 2018 fight, the Alabama fighter soaked up pressure from his older opponent before sending him to the canvas with a straight right hand to the forehead.</p>
      <p>Ortiz was on his feet before the end of the count but was still shaky and the referee called an end to proceedings.</p>
      <p>The decision was a tough one for the 40-year old Cuban, who had made all the running in the early rounds.</p>
      <p>It takes Wilder’s record to 42-0-1 and sets him up for a February, 2020 date with Tyson Fury, the undefeated British boxer he drew with in Los Angeles almost a year ago.</p>
      <p>“After that I am looking for a unification bout,” Wilder said. “I want one champion, one face, one name and he goes by the name Deontay Wilder.”</p>
