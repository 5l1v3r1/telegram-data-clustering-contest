      <h1>Man Utd should sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer now and appoint Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>Ed Woodward should have already spoken to Pochettino - his philosophy fits with United's and wherever he goes next he will win trophies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Stan Collymore, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/stan-collymore/</a></address>
      <p>If you are Ed Woodward and Manchester United, you should already have had a chat with Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Argentine’s philosophy fits hand in glove with United's and the respect he gets from players is second to none.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Poch would be in a position to compete almost immediately at Old Trafford for the kind of trophies – the League Cup and FA Cup – that Jose Mourinho has been hired to win for Spurs.</p>
      <p>And, in the years to come, he would transform the playing squad at United into an even younger, hungrier one.</p>
      <p>It’s a no-brainer and I wouldn’t be waiting until the summer to make the cruellest cut of all in sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. I’d be doing it now.</p>

      <p>Pochettino is hurt, he’s stung, he’s bitter, he’s angry and he’d pour all those emotions into making United a force again.</p>
      <p>I love Ole, but if he had played for any other club than United, he would not have been in the frame for the job when Mourinho was axed.</p>
      <p>Poch is a better manager, he has a better track record and he is a better choice for United.</p>
      <p>And if they don’t take him now, they will deserve all the what-ifs that will come their way in years to come – because he will go somewhere else and get success.</p>
      <h3>Wales. Golf. And get yourself back home</h3>

      <p>I love the fact Gareth Bale stuck it to Real Madrid and the Madridistas by celebrating Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification success with a 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order' banner.</p>
      <p>It was the same as scoring a goal and running past the away end while giving them the bird.</p>
      <p>He has been dealt with appallingly by Real and Zinedine Zidane, who should know better after his own experiences as a player.</p>
      <p>Had Zidane and Real treated Bale anywhere near what his status in the game deserves, then he wouldn’t have felt the need to do it.</p>

      <p>I mean, come on, he is hardly a revolutionary or one for making outrageous, impassioned statements, is he?</p>
      <p>So the fact that he wanted to make his point so animatedly probably tells you more about the way Real have treated him than the way he has treated them.</p>
      <p>Bale has delivered big goals in big games and trophies for the Spanish club – and yet they have still given him no respect whatsoever.</p>
      <p>It should be a case of 'Wales. Golf. And get yourself back home'.</p>
