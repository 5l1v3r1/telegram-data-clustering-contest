      <p><b>LOS ANGELES – </b>The NFL has slapped Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with a $50,000 fine as part of the ongoing fallout from the Steelers-Cleveland Browns brawl on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Rudolph, who was one of the central combatants in the fourth-quarter kerfuffle, was one of 33 players from the game who were hit with fines.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was not suspended for his role in the fight, which included Browns defensive end Myles Garrett ripping Rudolph’s helmet off and clobbering the quarterback with it.</p>
      <p>Garrett claimed Rudolph used a racial slur, although the NFL said it found no evidence of that and suspended Garrett indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Garrett, who received a $45,000 fine, also stands to miss out on at least $1,139,911.76 in salary as he misses at least the last six regular-season games. That figure could rise if his suspension continues next season.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi was banned one game and Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey was banned for three games but appealed and got it down to two.</p>
      <p>Additionally, both teams were fined $250,000 each.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, NFL Network reported the list of 29 members of the two teams who were each fined $3,507 each for leaving the sidelines and entering the “fighting area.”</p>
