      <p>Danny Green was open. As the Thunder ran back in transition, no one matched up on the Lakers sharpshooter until after LeBron James tossed a pass ahead to him on the left wing.</p>
      <p>Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson recognized the play and ran from the center of the court out to Green on the perimeter, but he contested the shot too late.</p>
      <p>Green drained the catch-and-shoot 3-pointer to give the Lakers a lead early in the third quarter of Los Angeles’s eventual 130-127 win Friday night in Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>For the second game in a row, the Lakers had made one of the Thunder’s strengths a weakness.</p>
      <p>Even after playing the Lakers twice in one week, the Thunder is statistically a top-10 transition defense. On average, OKC gives up 19.1 points in transition per game, according to NBA.com. The Kings lead the NBA in limiting points in transition (14.6 per game), while the Pelicans bring up the rear (24.5).</p>
      <p>In the Thunder and Lakers’ first meeting, however, Los Angeles scored 30 fast-break points, taking advantage of its eight blocks and the Thunder’s 16 turnovers.</p>
      <p>“For us to get 30 (against the Thunder) is unique, and we can’t expect to rely on that in Game 2,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said before Friday’s game. “We have to be better with our halfcourt offensive execution, but any chance we can get to force turnovers and get out on the break, we’re going to try to do so.”</p>
      <p>The Lakers didn’t rely on transition points Friday, but they still scored 19. The majority of those came in the beginning of the third quarter, when Los Angeles scored 13 fast-break points in the span of five minutes to take its largest lead of the night (15 points).</p>
      <p>“I think we needed to have a little more urgency getting back,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said.</p>
      <p>On Monday, OKC faces Golden State, a middle-of-the-pack transition offense averaging 14.1 fast-break points per game.</p>

        <b>Rondo fined</b>
      </p>
      <p>The NBA fined Lakers guard Rajon Rondo $35,000 for an incident involving Thunder guard Dennis Schroder, the league announced Saturday.</p>
      <p>Rondo received a Flagrant Foul 2 an was ejected about a minute and a half into the fourth quarter Friday. As James brought the ball up the floor, Schroder matched up on Rondo. While uninvolved in the play, Rondo lifted his right leg in between Schroder’s legs to give a blow below the belt.</p>
      <p>The league fined Rondo for making unsportsmanlike physical contact with Schroder, “verbal abuse” of a game official, and failing to leave the court in a timely matter.</p>
