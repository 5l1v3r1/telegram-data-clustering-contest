      <h1>Steven Gerrard issues Rangers challenge as Ibrox side enter season defining block</h1>
      <h2>The Rangers boss knows that the six weeks until the winter break could be the biggest of his managerial career.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers have already overcome a few psychological barriers with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> in charge.</p>
      <p>Their first Old Firm league victory in six years. Back in a European group stage after nearly a decade in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>And reaching a first League Cup Final since 2011. All achieved by a squad, moulded and gelled together by Gerrard in 17 months at the helm.</p>
      <p>But in the space of 29 days in December, across eight games of football, his players will face the biggest test yet of their mental toughness.</p>
      <p>And by the end of it, the manager will know for certain if they have the resilience – and quality – to lift silverware.</p>
      <p>They have Premiership fixtures against Hearts, Aberdeen, Motherwell, Hibs and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock.</a> Not to mention an Old Firm clash at Celtic Park.</p>

      <p>Crammed in amongst them, there’s the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Final</a> against the Hoops at Hampden as well as two Europa League ties against Feyenoord and Young Boys to qualify for the last 32.</p>
      <p>To say it’s huge for Gerrard and his team is an understatement. It certainly won’t faze him, a player who has been through it all in his career.</p>
      <p>But it’s the acid test for his players. If they emerge unscathed in the title battle, and with a trophy or Euro progress in the bag, it could define their season.</p>
      <p>Gerrard is refusing to look too far down the line, beyond Hamilton Accies today and a trip to Holland in midweek.</p>
      <p>But he’s convinced his players have the character to tackle any challenge.</p>
      <p>He said: “There’s no getting away from it. There’s some tough, challenging fixtures in the next block of games.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve earned that, by winning a semi-final and having something to play for in Europe. So it’s an exciting period and one we’re looking forward to.</p>

      <p>“I watch the players closely every day. The way we finished the last block of games, there was a real hunger there.</p>
      <p>“They’re looking forward to getting their teeth into them.</p>
      <p>“But I know it’s a big challenge. We don’t have to go to Celtic Park until December 29 – and we’re still only in the middle of November. So we’ll concern ourselves with that when we have to.</p>
      <p>“Right now, we have to beat Hamilton away on astroturf, live on TV with an early kick-off. Everyone is waiting for a bit of drama.</p>
      <p>“Is it right for people to talk about the next block of fixtures and challenges within it? 100 percent, yes.</p>
      <p>“But it would be naive to start talking about an Old Firm game, the tie with Young Boys in a couple of weeks or the League Cup Final. That would take my focus off Hamilton.</p>
      <p>“Do I have any doubts about the players’ mentality? I never doubt this group.</p>

      <p>“I put them together, I signed them for a reason – because I have belief and confidence in them.</p>
      <p>“Does that mean we’re going to smash everyone and it’s going to be perfect? That’s not something I can say right now.</p>
      <p>“But we’re a good, strong team. And we’ve proved so far that we’ve been okay when tough challenges come our way.</p>
      <p>“Looking at each of those December fixtures in isolation, I have confidence that we’ll be good enough and in a really good position to compete in the challenges we face across the board.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard has already used his entire squad to good effect this term.</p>
      <p>Tinkering with his team has been risky at times. But overall, it’s paid off given where <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> find themselves in three competitions.</p>
      <p>That was his plan in the summer – to recruit enough bodies to compete on all fronts. And he’s well aware it’s a strategy that will be tested to the full before the winter break in January.</p>

      <p>He said: “It’s the exact reason why we went for volume.</p>
      <p>“You have to picture scenarios where you have a run in the cup and go to the wire in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>“We knew we could be in a situation where we have 10 or 11 games in a six-week period – and that’s what we’ve got.</p>
      <p>“So two things are important – volume and quality. That’s what we tried to do when we put the squad together.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to say last summer that we were the finished article. People would jump all over you if you had a setback or bump in the road. I like to do the talking when the games start and so far we’re doing okay.</p>
      <p>“I need to keep driving everything and make sure the players are focused.</p>
      <p>“We set the scene for them, show them the schedule and what’s ahead.</p>
      <p>“But it’s important the players put blinkers on and worry about the next three points or next competition – that’s all that matters.”</p>
      <p>With Celtic playing yesterday, there’s added pressure on Rangers to get a result at Hamilton this afternoon.</p>

      <p>It’s a scenario that will be repeated – for both sides – as the title race begins to gather pace. And that’s why Gerrard wants his players to fly out the traps in EVERY game they play.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s impossible to forget the Celtic score, we’ll always be aware of their result.</p>
      <p>“But it’s vital you focus on your own job and what you can control.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the last group of fixtures, we had a 15-minute period at Hearts when we were slow out of the blocks. And it cost us.</p>
      <p>“That’s the reason we just have to concentrate on ourselves.”</p>
