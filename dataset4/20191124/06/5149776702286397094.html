      <p>Residents in Netherfield are being urged to take their bins in and keep alleyways free of rubbish.</p>
      <p>The streets where reports of rubbish being left are <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/netherfield">Deabill Street,</a> Manvers Street, Ashwell Street and Dunstan Street.</p>
      <p>A newsletter sent out to residents said: "There are concerns about the number of rear access pathways that are filled with rubbish thereby making pathways difficult to access.</p>
      <p>"It is the responsibility of those who live in these properties to be kept clean and clear of rubbish at all times."</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Executive of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/gedling-borough-council">Gedling Borough Council</a>, Mike Hill said: “We take great pride in keeping our streets clean and most residents do take their bins in after they’ve been emptied but there are a small minority that don’t and we will continue to highlight that they need to keep their alleyways and side street areas clear for bin storage.</p>

      <p>"Bins left on the street can cause access problems for people with vision impairments, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/family-kids/">parents</a> with pushchairs and people using wheelchairs and scooters on pavements.</p>
      <p>"If households do have large items that they want to remove, we offer a bulky waste service, which will be free during December and January as part of our annual bulky waste amnesty.”</p>
