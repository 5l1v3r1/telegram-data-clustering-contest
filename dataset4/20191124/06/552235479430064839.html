      <h1>Ryan Jack warns Rangers to be more clinical as he explains the pressure at Ibrox</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder reckons his side could have been more comfortable during the 1-0 win against Feyenoord and believes they'll need to be better in front of goal in Rotterdam.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Jack was only six when Dick Advocaat had <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> competing in the Champions League with the biggest clubs in Europe.</p>
      <p>But he’s seen the footage, watched the clips of Gers beating Parma, PSV and Monaco – and holding their own against Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, the Dutch coach, who spent three years at Ibrox, will attempt to derail this current Gers side’s charge to the last-32 of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>But Jack, as one of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard’s</a> midfield lynchpins, will have something to say about that. He’s relishing the prospect of facing Feyenoord in the De Kuip but, ultimately, wants to help lead the club back to where Advocaat had them two decades ago.</p>
      <p>When Advocaat arrived in Glasgow in 1998, Rangers were spending fortunes to try and reach the pinnacle of European football.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Jack</a> knows this is a different era altogether. But also that the expectation levels of the supporters will never change, no matter the circumstances.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old, who was excellent for Scotland in their double-header against Cyprus and Kazakhstan, said: “The Feyenoord game will be tough away from home.</p>
      <p>“At home against them, we had chances to kill the game off but managed to hold on for a 1-0 victory. Their players are international level so if you switch off for a second they’ll punish you.</p>
      <p>“First up though are Hamilton – and we hope a good result will carry us into the Feyenoord game on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I was young when Advocaat was at Rangers but I know about that time. Of course, we want to be successful and get back to that level.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always said we’ve achieved nothing yet with this team. There’s a long way to go.</p>
      <p>“We’re doing well at the minute and hopefully this is the year we’ll get success.</p>

      <p>“Back then, that was the case for Rangers. They had a great squad, a great group of players.</p>
      <p>“That same expectation is there from the fans for us to go and compete to win trophies.</p>
      <p>“As players, we’ve got to be driven by that and we want to win something this year.</p>
      <p>“When you’re at a club like Rangers, you know the demand before you sign up for it. That never changes.</p>
      <p>“As soon as you go out on the pitch, it’s only about three points, winning a semi or final or lifting a trophy.</p>
      <p>“This season is going well but we can’t take anything for granted. There’s a lot of hard work to do yet.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a great coaching staff and group of players so maybe the expectation is rising a bit.</p>
      <p>“There’s a good feeling about the club right now and we’re looking to keep that going.”</p>
      <p>Jack has excelled in Europe for Rangers – the style of football suits him and he offers Gerrard’s team much needed composure in possession, particularly away from home.</p>
      <p>Playing on the international stage, alongside Celtic’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/callum-mcgregor">Callum McGregor,</a> will also benefit him.</p>
      <p>And he believes Gerrard’s belief in him, to play further forward in Gers’ midfield, has taken his game to another level.</p>

      <p>Jack said: “I’d say international football and Europa League are at a similar level. The standard of player when you go away with Scotland is excellent.</p>
      <p>“There are Premier League players, boys from Celtic, guys who are playing at a good standard.</p>
      <p>“I feel confident in that company right now. I’m in good form and Rangers are getting good results.</p>
      <p>“That definitely helps when I go away with the national team.</p>
      <p>“We’re getting positive results against players from Porto, Feyenoord and Young Boys – all clubs with international players.</p>
      <p>“If you can hold your own against them and get good results, it helps your confidence when you go away to play for Scotland.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same sort of level, a similar feeling out there. As soon as you put on that jersey there’s an expectation that you have to stand up and answer.</p>
      <p>“Our manager has set up Rangers in a 4-3-3 this season and has told me to go and do what I do in training every day.</p>
      <p>“He tells me to be myself, to play free. He’s given me that confidence – and it’s definitely paying off.”</p>
      <p>Jack is competing with some top midfielders for club and country.</p>

      <p>Midfield is Scotland’s strongest department with the likes of McGregor, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, John Fleck and Kenny McLean all vying for places.</p>
      <p>But Jack enjoyed his partnership with Old Firm rival McGregor last week and hopes he’s done enough to convince gaffer Steve Clarke that he should keep his place for the Euro 2020 play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>Jack said: “I enjoyed being away. The manager was excellent and there’s a real positivity about the camp after two good results.</p>
      <p>“That will stand us in good stead for the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“Myself and Cal found it difficult in the first half against Kazakhstan when they went 1-0 up. But we took control and it was an enjoyable second half.</p>
      <p>“The midfield mix is good. John got his goals and he’s been excellent.</p>
      <p>“The manager told Cal and me to back up the play and be there for our centre-backs.</p>
      <p>“I thought it gelled quite well and hopefully I’ve done enough to show that I can compete at that level.”</p>
