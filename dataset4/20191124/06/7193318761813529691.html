      <p>From the sepia-toned cover art to the timeless covers of ballads like "Almost Like Being in Love," "Fly Me to the Moon" and "Can't Take My Eyes Off You," Max von Essen wasn't just putting on a catchy title when he called his new album "Call Me Old Fashioned: The Broadway Standard."</p>
      <p>"I've always just been attracted to another era. I've done a couple of Broadway shows — I've been really fortunate — but to this day, my favorite one, without a doubt, has been 'An American in Paris.' I remember watching the movie as a kid, and I was always drawn to the Gershwin music," said von Essen, who received a Tony nomination for his turn as Parisian aristocrat Henri in the post-World War II-era show.</p>
      <p>"I was always drawn to the big MGM musicals and Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope. ... I wish I had been around for when variety shows were the thing and almost every celebrity had their own variety show on TV."</p>
      <p>He will get his long-awaited shot at an old-fashioned variety show when he stars in the Oklahoma City Philharmonic's annual yuletide extravaganza "The Christmas Show" Dec. 5-7 at the Civic Center.</p>
      <p>For the 15th year, Music Director Emeritus and conductor Joel Levine and Director Lyn Cramer are collaborating to create the original holiday production, which annually features tap-dancing Santas, the Mistletoes dancers from the University of Oklahoma and the Philharmonic Pops Chorale. The 2019 edition also will showcase local vocalist Mandy Jiran and Guthrie actor Stephen Hilton reprising his role as Santa.</p>
      <p>"It's as close as Oklahoma gets to Radio City Music Hall ... during the Christmas season. It's just phenomenal," Hilton said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Star power</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the years, "The Christmas Show" has featured Broadway stars like Oklahoma native Kelli O'Hara, Beth Leavel and last year's featured guest, Nikki Renée Daniels, who is currently starring in the Chicago production of "Hamilton."</p>
      <p>"I haven't worked with a single one of the guest stars that's come in that hasn't just been incredibly generous and just sweet as they could be off stage and on," Hilton said. "It's just been tremendous."</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Stanley, star of the 2017 edition, talked up the Oklahoma City production for von Essen.</p>
      <p>"It's totally my style, the kind of format of a show that I love, and I don't think I've ever done anything — no, I've definitely never done anything — like this. So, it's gonna be a real treat," he said. "This is a big show. This isn't sort of the typical symphony concert that I'm asked to do here and there. This seems like a big, splashy production — and I'm ready for it. I can't wait."</p>
      <p>The New York native made his Broadway debut as a disciple and Jesus understudy in the 2000 revival of "Jesus Christ Superstar." He recently starred on Broadway as Gleb Vaganov in the musical "Anastasia" and then toured the country as Marvin in the Lincoln Center production of "Falsettos." Along with his acclaimed turn in "An American in Paris," he also performed on Broadway in the revival of "Evita." He played Jean Prouvaire in the closing company of the original "Les Miserables" and a few years later took on the role of Enjolras in the first revival.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Orchestral flight</b>
      </p>
      <p>The philharmonic's family-friendly production will feature seasonal favorites like "Winter Wonderland," "Jingle Bell Rock" and "Sleigh Ride," plus sacred selections like "I Wonder as I Wander" and "Angels We Have Heard on High." Hilton said he is excited for the return of the Santa-centric number "Magical Toys of Christmas."</p>
      <p>For von Essen, he is delighted that the OKC Philharmonic takes requests: He is especially looking forward to performing David Friedman and David Zippel's "Just in Time for Christmas," which was originally recorded by the late New York cabaret singer Nancy LaMott.</p>
      <p>"It's a little bit bittersweet and a little melancholy, but it's still ultimately so uplifting. I just love it so much," he said. "I've only done it with a couple of instruments. But it's become something that's very personal to me and feels almost like my Christmas song now. And I've never certainly had the chance to do it on this kind of a scale. So, to know that they've now orchestrated it for the philharmonic ... I don't know what it's gonna be like when I first hear it played by them; I think I'm just gonna be in tears."</p>
      <p>Although he loves Broadway, von Essen said relishes te chances to perform with a full orchestra.</p>
      <p>"When you hear a big orchestra like this and then you have the opportunity to sing, you feel like you're flying," he said. "It just feels like you've caught the wind under you and you soar. It's really an incredible feeling."</p>
