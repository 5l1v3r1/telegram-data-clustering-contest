      <h3>Phoenix Suns Preview</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a> are one of the most surprising teams of the league this season, as they are seventh in the Western Conference. While they are currently seventh, they have been anywhere from the 5-7 range. The Suns were a lottery team last season, but if they continue to improve, they won't be much longer.</p>
      <p>The Suns have a record of 8-7. They are one game over .500 and so far, exceeding expectations.</p>
      <p>One thing that is most impressive about their season is that they are playing well without their center Deandre Ayton. Ayton was suspended earlier this season after testing positive for a diuretic, which is against the NBA's anti-drug policy. Once Ayton returns, the Suns maybe even more dangerous.</p>
      <p>Phoenix beat Minnesota in a close one on Saturday in what was the first of two back-to-back road games. They have trouble on their hands as they face the second-best team in the West.</p>
      <h4>Key Player- Devin Booker</h4>

        <figcaption>Devin Booker</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/devin-booker">Devin Booker</a> is one of the league's brightest young stars. He is a skilled offensive player that has the makings of a superstar. The young guard is off to a good start, as his team puts the league on notice.</p>
      <p>Booker averages 24.9 points and 6.0 assists. He finished Saturday's game with 35 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists. He nearly had a triple-double as the Suns got the win. Devin Booker is a critical piece of the Suns' core, and as always, they'll need him to deliver.</p>
      <h4>Suns predicted lineup</h4>
      <p>Kelly Oubre, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Devin Booker, Tyler Johnson</p>

      <h3>Denver Nuggets Preview</h3>
      <p>The young <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/denver-nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a> are an exceptional team. They proved it last year, and are on track to have a similar season. With a record of 11-3, they are second only to the Lakers (who are 14-2). The Nuggets are a force and as such, should be taken seriously.</p>
      <h4>Key Player - Nikola Jokic</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/nikola-jokic">Nikola Jokic</a> is one of the league's best big men. He currently averages 17.3 points, 9.5 rebounds, and 6.1 assists. He finished the game against the Celtics with a triple-double. Jokic had 18 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. The center can do it all, and when he plays well, the Nuggets play well.</p>
      <h4>Nuggets predicted lineup</h4>
      <p>Will Barton, Paul Milsap, Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Gary Harris</p>

      <h3>Suns vs Nuggets Match Prediction</h3>
      <p>This has the makings of a good game. The Suns have cooled off slightly, but they are still playing better than expected. They snapped a three-game losing streak with Saturday's win. The Nuggets are on their winning streak and look like a legitimate threat.</p>
      <p>If the Nuggets play like they have, the streak will be extended.</p>
      <h3>Where to Watch Suns vs Nuggets?</h3>
      <p>This game will be televised locally (Altitude Sports and Fox Sports Arizona) but will be on NBA League Pass as well.</p>
