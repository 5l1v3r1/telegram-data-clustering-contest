      <p>Introducing herself to a table of strangers, Wendy Young tells the story of her name. “It came from my brother, who was reading Peter Pan at the time,” Young says to the rest of her group at a city-hosted session on Indigenous reconciliation.</p>
      <p>Young had just heard Florence Dick, a member of the Songhees Nation, explain the 300-year history behind her traditional name, nuumtunat.</p>
      <p>“It comes from the Sumet family, which was one of the longest-reigning chiefs of Songhees,” Dick said, writing her name in Lekwungen on a paper tablecloth. Dick has been learning her language as an adult, and passing the words on to her young grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Her great-great-grandfather was James Sumet, who was given his first name by Sir James Douglas, the first governor of the colony of British Columbia. “[Douglas] saw leadership qualities in him. That’s why he went and sought him out to be a leader in the Inner Harbour,” she said.</p>
      <p>Lara Costa, who shared the table with Dick and Young, said listening to stories about her tablemates’ names and families helped to foster connection.</p>
      <p>“When I was hearing you guys talking about your family and where you come from, I think you can imagine the whole story behind you, behind your name. So it already brings something with you. Your name carries a lot of history,” said Costa, who moved to Victoria two years ago from Brazil.</p>
      <p>The women were at one of dozens of round tables set up in the Victoria Conference Centre Monday night for a reconciliation dialogue, the second in a series of six organized by the City of Victoria. About 200 people attended the session, which had to be moved from city hall’s council chambers due to the high level of interest.</p>
      <p>The six-part series is designed to bring Indigenous and non-Indigenous people together to explore what reconciliation means and why it’s needed.</p>
      <p>This night was focused on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, an international framework ensuring critical rights for First Nations: to be recognized as distinct peoples, to self-determination, to freedom from discrimination, and to free, prior and informed consent.</p>
      <p>In October, the province tabled a bill in the legislature that would implement UNDRIP. If it passes, B.C. will become the first province to legally implement the framework.</p>
      <p>Brianna Bear, a member of Songhees and ‘Namgis nations, led the session. She told participants she wanted to teach them just enough about the declaration to inspire curiosity to learn more on their own.</p>
      <p>“I just want to give a chance for each and every one of you to discover what some of the rights are. How do you play a role in that?” Bear said.</p>
      <p>While the 46 articles of the UN declaration were projected on a screen one at a time, Bear posed questions that encouraged the small groups to reflect together. The first question prompted the discussion about names and families.</p>
      <p>Bear said the question was designed to show non-Indigenous people how to introduce themselves in a traditionally Indigenous way, and to build relationships between strangers.</p>
      <p>She also challenged the groups to name all the First Nations whose land Greater Victoria encompasses. When Bear asked the groups after about 10 minutes of discussion how many were able to identify all nine, a small number of hands went up.</p>
      <p>Bear said she wasn’t surprised at the response, and she included the question because she thinks it’s one of the first things people should learn.</p>
      <p>The question prompted Dick to explain to those at her table the distinction between Songhees, Esquimalt and Lekwungen.</p>
      <p>She said non-Indigenous people should refer to Songhees or Esquimalt nations when on the reserves or when referring to specific members of the nations.</p>
      <p>“But when we come off, we’re automatically one. There’s no divide. We become stronger when we’re one,” Dick said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, she said the term Coast Salish is often improperly used, explaining that it’s a broad term that refers to many nations — extending from northern Vancouver Island to the Lower Mainland and western Washington. It’s better to use the name of the nation whose land you are on than the broad term Coast Salish, she said.</p>
      <p>The daughter of parents who attended residential school, Dick refers to herself as “a product child.”</p>
      <p>“When they came out, they didn’t know how to parent us. My mom didn’t know how to parent us. She struggled with that. We had a lot of struggles in our life, because she didn’t know how to be a mom. It was hard, and I didn’t know any of her story until I was 35, until she actually started talking about it,” Dick said. “It’s because they suppressed it with alcohol, addictions, everything, so they wouldn’t have to come to the reality of what really happened to them.”</p>
      <p>Dick said later that even though she just scratched the surface in telling her story, she felt compassion and curiosity from those at her table.</p>
      <p>She said one woman told her she had never gotten as much value from a reconciliation event as she did from listening to Dick speak. “I really thought that was meaningful,” Dick said, adding she was grateful to see so many non-Indigenous people participating in the evening. “I’m really grateful they came with an open heart and open mind to get to know someone.</p>
      <p>“If no one came, who would we be talking to?”</p>
      <p>The evening left her feeling hopeful that people are ready to understand how the legacy of colonization continues to affect Indigenous peoples.</p>
      <p>“We have some strong allies that will see my grand-daughter as a proud Indigenous young girl, and not just another poor Indian child, which is how some people view us,” she said.</p>
      <p>Bear said many people expressed gratitude to her for the evening’s discussion. At the end of the night, she noticed one group had drawn a map of the territories on the table, and another had doodled a food system.</p>
      <p>“One lady actually shared with me that her and her whole table all exchanged numbers and they’re going to keep in contact to discuss more with one another about UNDRIP and TRC and how they fit into it,” Bear said.</p>
      <p>The goal of the dialogues is to provide opportunities to discuss how the community can make the culture, history and lived reality of local Indigenous peoples more visible and valued in the city.</p>
      <p>The sessions build on each other and are designed to be attended as a series.</p>
      <p>The first evening focused on Lekwungen history and culture, and participants heard oral stories told by elders.</p>
      <p>Other dialogues in the series will discuss topics such as the relationship between newcomers to Canada and reconciliation, and the place for controversial historical figures, including Sir John A. Macdonald. The next four events run on Jan. 20, March 2, May 4 and July 8.</p>
      <p>At the end of each session, those leading the event select four people to act as witnesses to the evening. They’re asked to address the rest of the group to share what they’ve learned and how they’ll move forward with reconciliation in their lives.</p>
      <p>The witnesses are presented with medallions from members of the City Family. The group — made up of the mayor, some city councillors and local Indigenous leaders — guides reconciliation work in the city.</p>
      <p>A livestream of Monday’s dialogue was watched by about 215 people. Video of the event is on the city’s website, along with more information on upcoming dialogues, including how to register. Helps said interest in the series has exceeded her expectations, with about 250 people already signed up to participate in the remaining four dialogues. regan<a href="mailto:-elliott@timescolonist.com">-elliott@timescolonist.com</a></p>
