      <p>A cheerful reunion, an interfaith choir and a dazzling dance — here are some of the most striking moments from Pope Francis’ four-day trip to Thailand, which ended Saturday when he jetted to Japan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Shoeless in Bangkok –</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a sight to behold: The head of Thailand’s Buddhists, sitting with the head of the world’s Catholic church — neither wearing shoes.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis readily adhered to local custom Thursday when he met Somdej Phra Maha Muneewong, leaving his shoes behind for their face-to-face.</p>

      <p>The Pope’s black-socked feet poked out from under his white robe, while the Buddhist patriarch’s bare feet were visible beneath his rich orange robes.</p>
      <p>Social media users praised the pontiff’s gesture of respect at the glittering gold Ratchabophit temple in Bangkok’s historic old quarter.</p>
      <p>After the meeting Francis found his black shoes where he left them — beneath a chair at the ornate temple.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Family reunion –</b>
      </p>
      <p>When Francis stepped off the plane in Bangkok he was met by top officials, cheering faithful and one very special visitor: his cousin, Sister Ana Rosa.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old nun has worked as a missionary in the country since 1966, runs a Catholic girls’ school, and is fluent in Thai.</p>
      <p>That made her the perfect interpreter for her cousin, who she still calls “Jorge” in reference to his birth name.</p>
      <p>“I am happy to see you and that you are able to be my translator,” Francis told her when he landed.</p>
      <p>Donning a white habit and long skirt — and often a warm smile — she barely left Francis’ side during his whirlwind four-day trip.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Peace songs –</b>
      </p>
      <p>Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs joined Catholics on Friday for an inter-religious meeting that included a performance of a mixed-faith choir.</p>
      <p>Muslims singers from Thailand’s so-called deep south joined Christian ethnic minorities — many in colorful embroidered head gear and smocks — to sing for the guest of honor.</p>
      <p>The ballads “Peace Prayer” and “Songs of Freedom” — composed specially for the ceremony — appeared to please the smiling pontiff, who applauded the young singers.</p>
      <p>It was a highly symbolic performance aimed at religious harmony, and drew more than 1,500 people, including scholars and students, to the university venue</p>
      <p>
        <b>– A sea of silk –</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pope Francis swapped his usual white robe for glittering gold and ruby-red silk versions — both woven just for him by local tailors — at the two masses he held.</p>
      <p>His bishops also donned matching outfits, pattered with an intricate “kanok” pattern — a ubiquitous Thai motif seen on clothing, furniture and artwork.</p>
      <p>The dazzling robes were handmade by tailors at a local convent, some who said it was the honor of a lifetime to sew for the holy entourage.</p>
      <p>“I am very glad and proud that my convent could make a robe for the Pope,” said Sister Sukanya, who oversaw the tailoring.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Dancing for the star –</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pope’s sombre Thursday night mass was capped with a series of colorful performances by 800 students.</p>
      <p>They split into four groups, each representing Thailand’s distinct cultures and regions.</p>
      <p>Parasol-twirling dancers, jubilant masked performers and straw-hatted figures all hit the stage for a spirited performance for the weary-looking Pope.</p>
      <p>They were accompanied by Phaya Naga, a mythical serpent-like creature — bright green and slithering and popular in local folklore.</p>
