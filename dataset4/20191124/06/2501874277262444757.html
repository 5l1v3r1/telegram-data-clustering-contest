      <p>Anyone else have their car window smashed and car broken into recently near the Parma Park trailhead? My car was broken into on Thursday, 11/21, at around 5pm. It appeared that there were other vehicles broken into, since there was glass. They attempted to use my cards at several local gas station and Iâ€™m researching camera footage. Maybe we can catch these thieves, if we find a common suspects in the footage, based on the times they attempted to use stolen cards.</p>
