      <p>Roger Federer and Alexander Zverev shattered the world record for attendance at a tennis match.</p>
      <p>A crowd of 42,217 watched an exhibition match between Federer and Zverev at Plaza de Toros Mexico – the world’s largest bullring – in Mexico City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters had previously set the record in their exhibition contest in 2010, which attracted 35,681 fans in Brussels.</p>
      <p>But that figure was topped as 20-time grand slam champion Federer defeated Zverev 3-6 6-4 6-2 in the “The Greatest Match”.</p>
