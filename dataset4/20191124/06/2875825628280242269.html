      <h1>Prisoner was found strangled to death in Cloverhill following row with another inmate</h1>
      <h2>Gardai have launched a murder inquiry following the death</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/emma-mcmenamy/" target="_blank">Emma McMenamy</a></address>
      <p>A prisoner was found strangled to death in his cell yesterday following a row with another inmate.</p>
      <p>Mark Lawlor, a petty criminal in his 30s who had been in custody for just over a week, was facing theft charges and was being held at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cloberhill-prison">Cloverhill Prison</a> in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest warders had to pull a fellow prisoner off him when they entered the cell following an altercation.</p>
      <p>The man who allegedly attacked him is believed to have sustained minor injuries during a fight.</p>
      <p>Prison staff tried to resuscitate Lawlor but he could not be revived.</p>
      <p>His body was taken to the city morgue, where a postmortem was due to take place yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Gardai have launched a murder inquiry following the death.</p>

      <p>A source said: “Inmates in the cell next to Lawlor’s heard a commotion and notified warders but Lawlor was already dead by the time they got to him.</p>
      <p>“They had to pull the other inmate off him.</p>
      <p>“It’s understood that a fight broke out between the two inmates after midnight and Lawlor was strangled. A reason for the row is not yet known.</p>
      <p>“A full investigation into the incident will now take place but there’s no rhyme or reason as to why it started yet.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman from the Irish Prison Service said: “All practicable measures are taken by management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody. </p>
      <p>“However, regrettably no prison system can be completely free of violence and inter-prisoner assaults do occur.” </p>
      <p>A Garda spokesman added: “Gardai are following a definite line of inquiry and the investigation is ongoing.”</p>
