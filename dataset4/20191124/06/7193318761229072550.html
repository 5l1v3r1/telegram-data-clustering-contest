      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph didn't escape the brawl with the Cleveland Browns unpunished.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was fined $50,000 on Saturday by the NFL for his involvement in the melee that began when Browns defensive end Myles Garrett pulled off his helmet and hit him over the head with it.</p>
      <p>Rudolph avoided suspension for his actions he tried to pull off Garrett's helmet and charged him but was one of 33 players fined by the league for their involvement. The league penalized 29 players $3,507 apiece for "entering the fight area."</p>
      <p>In all, the league handed out more than $700,000 for discipline stemming from the ugly final seconds of Cleveland's 21-7 win over Pittsburgh last week. There was another $77,206 assessed for personal fouls earlier in the game.</p>
      <p>Garrett was indefinitely suspended by the league for tearing off Rudolph's helmet and using it "as a weapon."</p>
      <p><b>JETS:</b> Signed tight end Ryan Griffin to a multiyear contract extension, rewarding one of the team's few bright spots on offense this season.</p>

        <b>Kim holds slim lead in LPGA finale</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sei Young Kim was on the verge of taking all the drama out of the chase for the richest payoff in women's golf history.</p>
      <p>She opened with three birdies in seven holes Saturday in the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, as her challengers either stalled or faded. She led by five shots before making the turn.</p>
      <p>Kim hit the brakes. Nelly Korda hit the gas.</p>
      <p>When the third round ended at Tiburon Golf Club, Kim had to settle for a 4-under 68 and a one-shot lead over Korda with one round remaining to see who wins the $1.5 million.</p>
      <p><b>PGA:</b> A few years removed from battling the full yips, Brendon Todd has a chance to be mentioned alongside Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson as he goes for a third straight PGA Tour victory.</p>
      <p>Todd felt like he couldn't miss Saturday at Sea Island and he rarely did. With six birdies on the front side of the Seaside Course in St. Simons Island, Georgia, he shot an 8-under 62 to tie the 54-hole tournament record and build a two-shot lead in the RSM Classic.</p>
      <p>Not since Dustin Johnson in 2017 has anyone won three straight starts on the PGA Tour.</p>
      <p>Not since Tiger Woods in 2006 has anyone won three straight tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule.</p>

        <b>American Mikaela Shiffrin sets record for wins</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coming off a record-breaking season with 17 race wins, Mikaela Shiffrin didn’t need much time in the new campaign to reach yet another milestone.</p>
      <p>The American set the all-time World Cup record for most slalom wins by any skier on Saturday, after earning her 41st career victory in the discipline at the season-opening slalom race.</p>
      <p>Shiffrin beat the 32-year-old best mark from Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark, who won 40 slaloms between 1974 and 1987. Shiffrin amassed her total in just seven years, having won her first race in December 2012.</p>
