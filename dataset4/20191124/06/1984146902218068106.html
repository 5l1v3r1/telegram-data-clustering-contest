      <p>It was a rainy and gloomy day as we headed into Shotley Bridge looking to stumble on a hidden gem to brighten the trip.</p>
      <p>We came across the Crown &amp; Crossed Swords - and were instantly stumped. As we walked through the door it didn't look like a place that served a Sunday roast and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/eddy-eats">Mrs E</a> thought we had stumbled through the wrong door.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, the food was served in a room adjoining the pub. So we headed down the corridor and tried again - walking into what was a newly refurbished room, with interesting decor and with a friendly face to greet us.</p>
      <p>It was busy and - although our first impression of the pub hadn't been an inviting one - we decided to stay. It seemed that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> pub had decided to launch a separate eatery within it, and the locals seemed to like it given the number of folk there.</p>
      <p>We were soon seated, and jumped straight in with our drinks oder which was whisked through from the pub.</p>

      <p>On to the food. There was a choice of four starters - a soup of the day, potato skins, scampi or Southern-fried chicken fillets.</p>
      <p>We went with the latter two options and although the portions for each weren't big, they did just enough to whet your appetite. The chicken was tender, while the scampi was done just right.</p>
      <p>From the choice of traditional meats on offer for the main we opted for lamb and chicken accompanied with all the traditional trimmings.</p>

      <p>Our meals weren't the most attractive we've been served but nonetheless we dived in. The meats were both good with the lamb really tender and the chicken breast equally as pleasing.</p>
      <p>Sadly the side dishes - except for the great Yorkshire puddings - let it down. The roast potatoes really let the side down being hard and far too crunchy. The mash was average, and the veg, although there was plenty of it, was generally a bit soggy.</p>
      <p>We finished what we had but decided that we'd avoid the puddings - and stick to the two courses for £11.95 each.</p>
      <p>The staff were lovely, and as I say, our chosen meats were tasty and cooked well, which makes a good foundation to build on.</p>
