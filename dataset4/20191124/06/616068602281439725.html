      <p>Kelowna city council will review a plan to rezone the former OK Builders site on Ellis Street from industrial to business commercial use.</p>
      <p>The site has been vacant since the company shut down valleywide operations in January.</p>
      <p>The property has a future land use designation of mixed use residential, which staff say would support the zoning change.</p>
      <p>According to the proposal before council, the owner of the property plans to lease the existing buildings to a new tenant or tenants with a more "retail-oriented focus."</p>
      <p>A company did recently use the building for a brief sale of Persian rugs.</p>
      <p>In the long-term, the owner does expect to apply to redevelop the site, and wants zoning in place consistent with their vision.</p>
