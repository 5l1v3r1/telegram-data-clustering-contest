      <h1>Exclusive: Former Yeovil Town boss is leading contender for Bristol City post</h1>
      <h2>Lee Johnson's old midfield teammate has held talks about U23s position</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <p>Former Yeovil Town manager Darren Way is the leading contender to join Bristol City and take the Robins' vacant U23s head coach role.</p>
      <p><i>Bristol Live</i> understands that Way is keen on the position and that preliminary talks have been held over the job.</p>
      <p>City are conducting a thorough recruitment process for the post, however, and are believed to have widened the search for a successor to former U23s boss Luke Williams as wide as possible. A final decision has yet to be made.</p>
      <p>Williams left the club 10 days ago, as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/exclusive-luke-williams-leaves-bristol-3535797">we exclusively revealed recently</a>, later being announced as joining up as an assistant head coach at MK Dons.</p>
      <p>Assistant U23s coach Alex Ball has been standing in since then, with the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> Development Squad beating Crystal Palace U23s 1-2 at the Eagles' training ground last week, and the Robins have considered promoting Ball permanently.</p>

      <p>But, according to our sources, Way remains the leading contender for the post, given his good relationship with Johnson and Jamie McAllister (having played alongside the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City </a>head coach and been a coach at Yeovil Town when McAllister was there too), knowledge of the football scene in the South West and previous work with the Glovers.</p>
      <p>Way took over at Hush Park in 2015 but was sacked in 2019 and is currently looking for the right job to return to football with.</p>
      <p>While internal discussions over filling the post were held, one interesting name to note that was mentioned by our sources was that of Louis Carey - the club's record appearance holder - and the former central defender is working in a similar capacity at U16s level with Southampton and helping Rob Edwards to coach the Wales U19s.</p>
      <p>Carey is not believed to be interested in returning to Ashton Gate at this time however.</p>
      <p>Assistant head coach Dean Holden was unsure on how or even if the club would replace Williams when we asked the former Oldham head coach in the pre-Nottingham Forest press conference.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure, to be honest. That'll be a club decision," <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-transcript-nottingham-forest-3555566">explained Holden last Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's only happened in the last few days. We wish Luke well; obviously it's a great job for him, assistant manager at a good club in MK Dons. It's a chance for him to experience first team football again. In terms of what we're going to do in replacing him, I'm not sure yet."</p>
