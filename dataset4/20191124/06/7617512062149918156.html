      <p>The Victoria Hospitals Foundation raised $1 million at its sold-out Visions gala, held at the Fairmont Empress Hotel, Nov. 16.</p>
      <p>The money, raised through ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, a bear raffle, live and silent auctions and a pledge drive, will go toward the purchase of priority, leading-edge imaging equipment for Royal Jubilee and Victoria General hospitals.</p>
      <p>“Every year, Visions helps transform health care on Vancouver Island and it’s remarkable to see so many generous people come together for this worthy cause,” said Darlene Hollstein, chair of the Visions steering committee. “As one of Victoria’s longest-running charity gala fundraisers, Visions has equipped our hospitals with urgently needed tools and technology over the past 29 years. Our whole community benefits from this outstanding generosity.”</p>
      <p>The equipment that will be purchased through Visions and The Big Picture, the foundation’s latest fundraising campaign.</p>
      <p>The goal of the Big Picture campaign, which was unveiled at Visions, is to raise $4 million to fund cutting-edge imaging equipment for both hospitals.</p>
      <p>Contributions to the campaign can be made online, by calling 250-519-1750, or mailing a donation to Wilson Block, 1952 Bay Street, Victoria BC, V8R 1J8. For more information, go to at victoriahf.ca.</p>

      <p>Advance tickets are $20 from performers or on Eventbrite and $25 at the door. The show starts at 7 p.m. Nov. 30, at First Metropolitan United Church, Quadra at Balmoral. The facility is wheelchair accessible and sign-language interpreted. Net proceeds will benefit programs and events to celebrate diversity and inclusion through the performing arts at West Coast Reach Association.

      <h3>Donate a gift, help a family in need</h3>
      <p>Help families in need by donating a gently used household item for the L’Ecole George Jay Elementary School’s Holiday Emporium.</p>
      <p>Every year the event offers a low-cost way for children to contribute to their family celebrations by “shopping” for gifts for their parents, siblings and friends, for just $1 each.</p>
      <p>The Holiday Emporium has been going on for over 10 years now and each year organizers see how this small token can make a real difference in the lives of George Jay families, many of whom simply can’t afford to shop during the holidays.</p>
      <p>The school is looking for new or lightly used good-quality items, such as candles, toys, ties, jewelry, picture frames, CDs, DVDs, books, puzzles, purses, wallets, scarves, tools, household goods, bath and beauty items — and they always need items suitable for dad.</p>
      <p>Goods should be clean and not broken — remember, the children are “shopping” for their families.</p>
      <p>The school is also seeking donations of wrapping materials, ribbons, small boxes, bubble wrap, tape and tissue paper (no Christmas-style decorations).</p>
      <p>Wrapping presents is part of the parent volunteer service, so the kids’ families really do get a surprise.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the Holiday Emporium go directly back to the school to help sponsor field trips and cultural events.</p>
      <p>Donations can be dropped off during school hours, Dec. 2 to 17. Emporium Day itself runs 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 18. Donations can be dropped off at L’Ecole George Jay Elementary School, 1118 Princess Ave. (near Cook and Bay streets). For more information, go to georgejay.sd61.bc.ca.</p>
      <h3>Fernwood fundraiser aids families in need</h3>
      <p>The Fernwood Neighbourhood Resource Group has just launched their annual Gift of Good Food fundraiser, now until Dec. 31.</p>
      <p>This is the fifth year of the event, with a goal of raising $100,000. This money raised is enough to provide fresh produce to 200 families facing poverty in the Capital Regional District for a year.</p>
      <p>Fernwood NRG will use their food access program, The Good Food Box, to distribute fresh food every two weeks for a year to families in need. All the produce comes from Michell’s Farms and The Root Cellar.</p>
      <p>The program is shared between 15 community-based organizations, from Sooke to Saanich, that choose families in their neighborhoods to directly benefit from this program.</p>
      <p>For more information, go to thegiftofgoodfood.ca/donate.</p>
