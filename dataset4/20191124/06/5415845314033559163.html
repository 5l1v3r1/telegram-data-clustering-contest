      <h1>Arsenal: 3 reasons Granit Xhaka deserves the best, just not here</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/mjohnson21/" target="_blank">Mac Johnson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/e61b8aee/Granit-Xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a> divides opinion among Arsenal fans. He is simultaneously praised, hated, and spurned by most Gooners. Here are three reasons he should move on.</p>
      <p>There are not many players more divisive than Granit Xhaka in the <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> squad. I can see an argument for <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/16380240/Mesut-Ozil">Mesut Özil</a>, maybe<a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/c0e27d1a/David-Luiz"> David Luiz</a>, and, okay, maybe <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/57e3f0c7/Nicolas-Pepe">Nicolas Pépé</a> as well. But especially in the last few months, with his fights with the fans, false apologies, and passive-aggressive social media posts, I think it’s his time to go.</p>
      <p>Here are three reason’s why.</p>
      <h3>3. He’s a quality player… just not for us</h3>
      <p>Granit Xhaka, like most players out there, has his inconsistencies. He is not naturally athletic enough to serve as an effective holding midfielder, and as a result relies on his aggression and combative nature to fill in for his shortcomings. His most effective play comes while his team is on the ball; he makes a very effective metronome, dictating possession and spraying passes to all corners of the field, and occasionally even smashing one into the top corner.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When we first signed him from Borussia Monchengladbach, I wasn’t sure what to expect. He was immediately met with the expectation of being the “next <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/f90f1086/Patrick-Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a>,” but from what I had seen of his highlights, he didn’t have the same brute strength, accompanied by the bulldozer mentality and grace on the ball which made Vieira one of our greatest players of all time. But his spirit and leadership were great, and his passing, his vision, were arguably better. I was optimistic.</p>
      <p>But he is inconsistent. Period. He’s had some majestic games, and some that make him look unworthy to sit on the bench. And part of this is because he does not fit English football. He is too pedantic on the ball, and too slow off of it. As a result, he makes mistakes, and the more he makes, the more it is apparent that he just is not good enough for this club.</p>
      <p>But that isn’t the sole reason. On to number 2.</p>
