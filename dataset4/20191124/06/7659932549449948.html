      <p>Spain is heading towards a money laundering trial against an uncle of Syrian regime leader Bashar Assad, the High Court said on Friday, after an investigating judge finished his probe.<br/><br/>The prosecuting office has ten days to comment on the judge’s recommendation that the case goes ahead, which is considered a formality, after which a trial start date will be set, the court said.<br/><br/>Two years ago, the High Court confiscated over 600 million euros ($663.24 million) of assets thought to be linked to Rifaat Assad.<br/><br/>He is a former military commander, widely held responsible for crushing an Islamist uprising in 1982 against then-president Hafez Assad, Bashar’s father. Many thousands were killed.<br/><br/>Rifaat Assad turned against the regime in 1984 after a power struggle over who would succeed his older brother, Hafez. He now lives in exile between France and Britain.<br/><br/>He is also facing trial in France for allegedly acquiring millions of euros worth of French property assets.<br/><br/>After he arrived in Europe, his lavish lifestyle, four wives, and 16 children soon raised eyebrows.<br/><br/>His reported French fortune includes two Paris townhouses, one of over 3,000 square meters (30,000 square feet), as well as a stud farm and chateau near the French capital, and 7,300 square meters of office space in Lyon.<br/><br/>Most of this was acquired in the 1980s through offshore companies in Panama, Curacao, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.<br/><br/>He and his family also own over 500 properties in Spain. These were seized by authorities in 2017.<br/><br/>French authorities opened an investigation in April 2014 after two non-governmental anti-graft groups, Sherpa and Transparency International, raised red flags.<br/><br/>Two years later, they charged Rifaat Assad with tax fraud and embezzlement of public funds.</p>
