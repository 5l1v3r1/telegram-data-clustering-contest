      <p>The bill to regulate the use of Social Media and curb fake news on the internet passed second reading at the Senate on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The bill, ‘Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill, 2019,’ sponsored by Mohammed Musa was introduced in the Senate two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Since its introduction, the bill has sparked outrage among Nigerians and internet users in particular.</p>
      <p>The legislation comes a few years after a <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/194386-nigerian-senate-pushes-social-media-clampdown-bill-hits-back-at-critics.html">similar anti-social media bill</a> </b>introduced in the eight Senate sparked outrage across Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Mr Musa said the bill does not intend to gag the media but to check the spread of false information on the internet.</p>
      <p>“It is rather an opportunity to address the growing threats which if left unchecked, can cause serious damage to our polity and disrupt peaceful existence,” he said.</p>
