      <h1>England battling to avoid first Test defeat after BJ Watling's 205</h1>

        <li>BJ Watling’s 205 leaves New Zealand primed for victory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With its stunning coastal views, buzzing hipster nightspots and beach lifestyle, Mount Maunganui on New Zealand’s North Island makes for an unlikely place to find a torture chamber. Yet at the seemingly pleasant Bay Oval Joe Root’s tourists were given the Iron Maiden, the Heretic’s Fork and the Scold’s Bridle all in one. BJ Watling’s 205 –the first Test double century by a wicketkeeper against England – and Mitchell Santner’s 126 – his first century in Test cricket – made you wonder whether the Black Caps might be rebranded as the Black Hoods.</p>
      <p>They are such friendly people in these parts this is clearly a nonsense. But nevertheless, when Kane Williamson declared on 615 for nine after 201 overs, leaving frazzled English minds the best part of four sessions to bat for the draw, and Santner then struck three times to leave their guests 55 for three at the close on day four, they had still inflicted some serious pain.</p>
      <p>This was not an entirely unfamiliar experience for England, who for the sixth time in four years shipped over 600 runs overseas after similar punishment in Cape Town, Chennai, Mumbai, Sydney and Perth. Root keeps talking about building a side to win back the Ashes in Australia in 2021-22 but across the Tasman Sea, in the here and now, this still looks fanciful by way of threat with the Kookaburra ball.</p>
      <p>And then there is the batting. England’s first innings 353 was fully shown up on this relatively benign surface by Watling and Santner’s subsequent display of bloody-mindedness, as the pair put on 261 for the seventh wicket over 83.2 overs – just shy of a whole day’s play. When the openers fell meekly on the fourth evening, it completed a personally golden day for Santner.</p>

      <p>As is often the way in these situations, the tails-up New Zealand quicks had more zip than their English counterparts and, having been responsible for their side’s previous 101 wickets on home soil, looked to be the threat once more. But instead it was the left-arm spin of Santner that prevailed in a crazed final hour.</p>
      <p>Watling, who wearily feathered behind after tea to give Jofra Archer his first wicket from his 252nd delivery, had spent just over 11 hours at the crease and took time off the field as Tom Latham deputised behind the stumps. When he returned at drinks it looked possibly too soon, missing an inside edge off Dom Sibley.</p>
      <p>But the Santner-Watling axis was not to be denied, Sibley perishing caught behind when pushing out to a wide ball on 12. If the debutant looked troubled against the spinner then the dismissal of Rory Burns for 31 – top-edging to short fine leg attempting a slog sweep – was similarly soft. When nightwatchman Jack Leach fell to a dubious bat-pad and didn’t review, it brought about stumps and England’s torture was at least paused.</p>
      <p>This was Santner’s day but it has been Watling’s match. Resuming on 119, it was a case of repeating the methods that had brought about Test century number eight to surpass Brendon McCullum’s record 185 as a Kiwi wicketkeeper. The 34-year-old returned to his impervious bubble: defending and leaving with surety, before picking off the loose ball whenever England’s heavy-legged bowlers erred in line or length.</p>
      <p>Santner meanwhile was a different beast to the one who had done well to survive a short-ball barrage the night before. Known as “Slink” by his New Zealand teammates and “Flatline” by those at Northern Districts – he has a fairly laid-back demeanour – his defence was now sound and his approach fittingly relaxed, chiselling out 170 balls for his half-century before taking 83 more for three-figures.</p>
      <p>A scratch golfer, rated among the very best on cricket’s rest-day circuit, Santner wasn’t afraid to bring out the driver either with five sixes. And when he teed off against Leach, launching him back over his head three times, one bespectacled left-hander was suddenly being taken down by another.</p>
      <p>Watling and Santner shrewdly opted to grind England down first thing, scoring just 19 runs in the first hour and 58 in the session. But during the afternoon they stepped on the accelerator as New Zealand put on a further 138, overcoming the third new ball and greeting their respective milestones with typically ego-free celebrations.</p>
      <p>Root, who had burned both reviews 24 hours earlier, found himself the subject of ironic jeers from the grass banks on the rare occasion he let out an optimistic appeal. But the captain will be more concerned by his seam attack – both by way of fatigue and threat - looking ahead to next week’s second Test in Hamilton.</p>
      <p>Archer and Stuart Broad sent down a combined 75 overs for figures of one for 171. For the former it was his first gallon in a first-class innings from 42 overs of toil, as well as his heaviest workload by 12. Broad continued his miserly ways but Root needs more than just control of the run rate.</p>
      <p>And then there was Curran, manhandled by Santner such that he scarcely celebrated eventually when winning out. The left-armer is just 21 years old and was ever-willing for his captain despite also shipping three-figures. But away from home, like this England side as a whole, he has so much work to do.</p>
