      <h1>How mum transformed derelict Welsh barns into her dream home after her children went to university</h1>
      <h2>Sam Measom packed up her life and escaped to the country after falling in love with Anglesey</h2>

      <p>Scan any property portal online and you will find numerous rural properties for sale that offer a tantalising escape from the 9-to-5 grind, urban pollution and commuter gridlock.</p>
      <p>Ultimate 'escape to the country' opportunities can be found throughout Wales.</p>
      <p>At any time there are a variety of country homes for sale that come with empty barns and outbuildings yearning to be renovated into income-generating holiday lets.</p>
      <p>But how many people actually take the plunge and give up city living to take on a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/renovation">restoration project</a> in rural Wales as a new way to live and a new way to earn money?</p>

      <p>Sam Measom visited <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/anglesey">Anglesey</a>, fell in love with the island, packed up her life in Leicestershire and escaped to live her country work /life dream.</p>
      <p>Sam, now 53, said: "After visiting South Stack lighthouse with a friend I was blown away by its stunning location. I fell in love with its rugged coastline and breath-taking scenery."</p>
      <p>On the way back from the visit Sam happened to see a 'For Sale' sign outside a derelict barn complex called Ty Nant.</p>
      <p>She remembers: "The vision and dream of owning a holiday let was immediately born when I set eyes on Ty Nant, the original barn.</p>
      <p>"I made the decision right then that I wanted to buy it and couldn’t wait to make an offer!"</p>

      <p>This might sound rather impulsive to many people but after 18 years of raising her children, they had recently flown the family nest to go to university and Sam was ready to dive into a new project.</p>
      <p>She was just unclear what this might be, until her fateful visit to Wales and the chance encounter with the barns.</p>
      <p>It was 2013 and the smallholding consisted of three buildings in various stages of dereliction.</p>
      <p>Sam says: "The original barn hadn’t been occupied for over 30 years and the other two barns were covered in ivy and brambles.</p>
      <p>"But it just felt as if it was the right place for me to live. I can’t explain it any other way, it was an inner sense of knowing.</p>
      <p>"Waking up to an ocean view everyday seemed like the perfect retreat - if I felt that way, then I was sure future guests would feel exactly the same."</p>

        <figcaption>Now the renovation has finished resulting in a home for Sam and two holiday lets<cite>(Image: Eye Imagery)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After six long months of negotiations, Sam finally secured the 4.5 acre plot and collection of rundown buildings for £340,000.</p>
      <p>The renovation plan was simple - start with the original barn called Ty Nant and live in this property whilst renovating the second holiday let called Ysbryd y Mynydd.</p>
      <p>Eventually both of these renovated buildings became holiday lets that then funded the rescue of the final derelict property, which is now her home.</p>
      <p>Sam says it was a tough and challenging time for her.</p>
      <p>"The pressure was on to get Ysbryd built, as the income from both holiday homes was very much needed to help towards creating and building my own home. It was a slow build.</p>
      <p>"But I had been so consumed with Ysbryd y Mynydd and everything being perfect for my first guests, that when I eventually moved into my own home, it was a complete mess and half built!"</p>

      <p>But the state of her eventual home at the time of moving was not the biggest unforeseen challenge that Sam encountered on her 'escape to the country' journey.</p>
      <p>The lowest point was losing her builders from the project.</p>
      <p>She says: "After three years of working with the same team of builders every day they suddenly left me to build somewhere else.</p>
      <p>"My home wasn’t finished and they’d barricaded me in with MDF board because half of the house was still open to the elements. It came completely out of the blue and after years of building up trust with the builders, it was a complete shock.</p>
      <p>"The project was then on hold for 12 months."</p>

      <p>Despite the setback, Sam kept going with the transformation of the buildings themselves but when the time came for her to think about the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/interior-design">interiors</a> of the holiday homes for her guests, her vision was clear.</p>
      <p>She says: "From comfy sofas to tranquil artwork, great care was put into creating the perfect setting for visitors to relax in after a day of exploring Anglesey. I spent hours looking at interior design websites to get inspiration."</p>
      <p>And there is one special spot within the whole complex that always completely captivates Sam.</p>
      <p>She says: "I love the upstairs floor of Ysbryd y Mynydd.</p>
      <p>"The views from the floor to ceiling windows towards Holyhead mountain are stunning, hence the cottage’s name which translates to ‘spirit of the mountain’.</p>
      <p>"Up here I’ve also left the steel girder that runs from one end of the building to the other visible because it’s the backbone holding it up and therefore should be appreciated."</p>

        <figcaption>Facilities are contemporary and stylish<cite>(Image: Eye Imagery / Mike Dean / Sykes Holiday Cottages)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ysbryd y Mynydd sleeps up to four people and has a large living space and garden with an in-ground trampoline, making it ideal for a family getaway.</p>
      <p>The contemporary upside-down format and floor-to-ceiling windows also make the most of the wonderful views on offer.</p>
      <p>One of the most popular areas of the holiday home with guests is the large deck area accessed from the first floor accommodation, a perfect place for al fresco dining surrounded by <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/seaside-cottage-award-winning-beach-17170752">sweeping views of the coast</a> and country.</p>
      <p>Now Sam has become not only an experienced property developer but also a recognised holiday host with the announcement of one of her properties becoming an award-winner.</p>
      <p>Ysbryd y Mynydd has won this year's 'Best in North Wales' category in the Sykes Gems Awards, a national awards programme celebrating excellence in holiday cottage accommodation.</p>
      <p>And Sam is absolutely thrilled.</p>
      <p>She says: "I've put so much into making both Ysbryd y Mynydd and Ty Nant a success and now work with a brilliant team of people from the local community who help to keep the properties running smoothly.</p>
      <p>"The award for Ysbryd y Mynydd really does mean a lot and the trophy will, of course, have pride of place in the property itself."</p>

      <p>The Sykes Gem Awards celebrate the best people and properties in the UK’s growing holiday cottage sector across a number of categories and are judged by a panel of industry experts.</p>
      <p>Sykes Holiday Cottages, who launched the awards three years ago, received 2,500 entries from throughout the UK and Ireland across 30 categories this year.</p>
      <p>However, the judging panel were impressed by the style and facilities on offer at Sam's property, along with guest feedback on cleanliness, comfort and value for money.</p>
      <p>Sam has definitely been bitten by the property renovation bug, as she is now in the throws of renovating another old ruin into another holiday home.</p>
      <p>None of the budget, builders or blustery Welsh weather challenges have deterred Sam, she believes she now has all the experience she needs to continue her rural retreats sucess.</p>
      <p>Sam couldn't be happier that she followed her escape to the country dream and now has a life and work balance that is perfect for her.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She says: "I definitely have a passion for my work, Anglesey has gorgeous scenery and for many it is love at first sight – it certainly was for me seven years ago.</p>
      <p>"And letting the cottages out to families and couples has been really fulfilling. I love getting to know the visitors who come to stay,<b> </b>there is no denying that I’ve got a taste for holiday letting now.</p>
      <p>"It’s been quite a journey but I’ve seen it through."</p>
