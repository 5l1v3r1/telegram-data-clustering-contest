      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/morrisons">Morrisons</a> is giving away a free mince pie and drink to all OAPs ahead of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> this year.</p>
      <p>Senior citizens can get the free refreshments in the store's café between 2.30pm and 5.30pm on December 3, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/morrisons-cafe-giving-oaps-free-20915816">Mirror Online reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The supermarket said the deal will provide the perfect opportunity for older customers to interact with each other during the festive period.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Morrisons said: "Nobody should have to be alone over the festive season.</p>
      <p>"To show our older customers how much we value them — and spread a little festive cheer — we’re offering all OAPs a free hot drink and mince pie in our cafes between 2.30pm and 5pm on Tuesday, December 3."</p>
      <p>A similar deal has been run by the supermarket before, at both Christmas and at Easter, when Morrisons gave out free hot cross buns and cups of tea.</p>
