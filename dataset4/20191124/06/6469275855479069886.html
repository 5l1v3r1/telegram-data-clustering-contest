      <h1>Dave Seddon's verdict: Preston North End again slow to get going after an international break as they lose to Derby County</h1>

        <b>Post-international break matches and Preston North End are a toxic mix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having to face clubs in such games who traditionally they don’t do well against whatever the occasion, just spoons in another dollop of frustration.</p>

      <p>The fixture computer wasn’t kind to the Lilywhites when churning out the contests to follow October and November’s international breaks.</p>
      <p>Reading away last month and Derby on Saturday were two games North End didn’t want as they returned to action after fortnight gaps in the fixture card.</p>
      <p>They’d won twice in 15 visits to Reading before this season, while home or away PNE had failed to beat Derby in 12 games.</p>
      <p>That run extended to 13 games at the weekend, as it had to two wins in 16 matches at the Madejski Stadium five weeks ago.</p>

      <p>Only twice in the last three seasons have Alex Neil’s men won after a break.</p>
      <p>Quite why that happens is something of a mystery. They don’t have too many players away with their countries, just Alan Browne and Sean Maguire this season.</p>
      <p>They don’t sit idle during the breaks, the first week a mix of training and rest before a normal schedule in the second week building-up to the return in action.</p>
      <p>Results haven’t quite been a one-way street after breaks, Brentford beaten in September while 12 months ago, Blackburn were hammered 4-1.</p>

      <p>Last month at Reading, North End were pretty poor throughout. It was similar in the first half against Derby, not quite so bad in the second half.</p>
      <p>They were fortunate to get to half-time just trailing by the single goal at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>The home side hit the bar and were twice thwarted in one-on-ones by Declan Rudd.</p>
      <p>Aided by a half-time double substitution and a number of players changing position, the visitors were better after the break but not to the extent where they could force an equaliser.</p>
      <p>They had their moments, notably a Jordan Storey shot which hit the outside of the post.</p>
      <p>However, it would have been harsh on Derby had they been forced to share the spoils. In truth, Preston didn’t do enough to deserve that.</p>
      <p>Such performances and results are that bit harder to take when standards have been set so much higher this campaign.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen many times what North End are capable of this season, with them going into this one on the back of three victories on the bounce.</p>
      <p>When things dip below expectations, frustration runs that much deeper.</p>
      <p>More than 2,400 North Enders had made the trip to the East Midlands, packing a corner section of Derby’s ground.</p>
      <p>It was PNE’s biggest away following of the campaign to date and they travelled with high hopes, even if results on the road haven’t been as strong as those at Deepdale.</p>
      <p>For 45 minutes, the Lilywhites didn’t show up, bar the occasional flash when they were able to string a move together.</p>
      <p>Neil was to admit that he was caught between two stools in terms of selection and approach.</p>
      <p>He wanted to play more of a possession-based game and try and hurt Derby with movement.</p>
      <p>Such an approach perhaps didn’t suit the strengths of Jayden Stockley but here you had a striker bang in form and full of confidence.</p>
      <p>Hence Stockley started but was taken off at the break along with Darnell Fisher who didn’t have the greatest 45 minutes of his life it must be said.</p>
      <p>Derby played a lot in the space behind him, Tom Lawrence having plenty of joy in particular.</p>
      <p>Booked in the 23rd minute for a foul on Mason Bennett, Fisher walked a tightrope until the interval.</p>
      <p>That was his ninth yellow card and only once more does Fisher need to fall off the tightrope to trigger a two-game suspension.</p>
      <p>Does Neil rest him at Hull to ensure his involvement against West Bromwich Albion or take the risk and deal with any consequences?</p>
      <p>It might be that they are without a key member of the back four anyway at Hull, in the shape of Ben Davies.</p>
      <p>He limped off with 18 minutes left, forcing the third and final substitution to be Storey’s introduction rather than David Nugent who was being readied to come on.</p>
      <p>Storey hitting the post with six minutes left was the nearest Preston legitimately came to levelling the scores.</p>
      <p>They’d earlier had the ball in the net, Tom Barkhuizen prodding in from close range after Davies had screwed a shot across goal.</p>
      <p>Up went the flag against Barkhuizen who Neil was later to argue might just have been onside. PNE had been chasing the game since the 33rd minute when Derby finally made a chance count.</p>
      <p>By then Rudd had denied Lawrence and sub Martyn Waghorn who had got behind the North End back line to get sights of goal.</p>
      <p>The winner was rather a straight forward one, Holmes’ corner from the left flicked goalwards by Curtis Davies for Waghorn to chest it over the line from two yards.</p>
      <p>The half-time changes from Neil sparked a response at least. Paul Gallagher and Billy Bodin came on, Stockley’s withdraw more tactical with Fisher taken off to save him from himself.</p>
      <p>Alan Browne dropped into the right-back role, Gallagher taking up a deep midfield role to get on the ball.</p>
      <p>Bodin took up a position on the right, Barkhuizen moving inside to play as a striker with Daniel Johnson as the No.10.</p>
      <p>So in effect four positions got a fresh look and North End were better for it.</p>
      <p>Gallagher was very good, spraying passes across the pitch in an attempt to get his team-mates behind Derby’s back four.</p>
      <p>As Neil pointed out though, Gallagher and Ben Pearson playing deeper left PNE a man shy higher up.</p>
      <p>Late on Patrick Bauer went up front in one last throw of the dice, the old classic of playing the big centre-back as an emergency striker. Unfortunately it didn't pay dividends.</p>
      <p>The good news is that the next international break isn't until March – for the record, Preston travel to Huddersfield straight after it.</p>
