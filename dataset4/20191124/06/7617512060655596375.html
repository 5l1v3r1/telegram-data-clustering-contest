      <p>Young students at Oaklands Elementary School have collectively and individually put their mark on a three-metre totem pole taking shape in the school’s courtyard in a project that teaches them about history, culture and themselves at the same time.</p>
      <p>The Oaklands Totem/Legacy Project is hosted by the Board of Education of School District No. 61 (Greater Victoria) and funded in part by the Victoria Foundation.</p>
      <p>The project addresses a growing interest among educators to include more Indigenous learning in the school curriculum. The creation of a totem pole gives children an opportunity to learn about First Nations culture and perspective in a holistic manner. The hope is that children can at the same time discover their own identity, place and culture.</p>
      <p>The carving began in February, with the aim that the pole will be finished in June 2020 to coincide with the end of the school year.</p>
      <p>“All the students have embraced the project, even voting for their four favourite animals to be included in the totem pole,” said Sandy Smith, acting vice-president at the school. “It is a cross-curricular project as well, using the pole’s symmetry to teach math, for example. They learn First Nations culture in classwork and other subject matter.”</p>
      <p>The project integrates Indigenous learning into childhood education in a meaningful way.</p>
      <p>The school-wide, hands-on, multi-grade, collaborative and cross-curricular project sees classes visit the courtyard at least once a week to watch and sometimes help renowned artist Carey Newman (who has Kwakwaka’wakw and Sto:lo Nation ancestry) carve the totem pole.</p>
      <p>Newman is also the artistic director for an eventual 50-minute film that documents the project, which includes the use of songs gifted by the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations.</p>
      <p>The documentary is being created to inspire other schools around the city — and the province — to host similar projects.</p>
      <p>Plans are to install the completed pole in the front of the school with a totem-raising ceremony.</p>
      <p>“The project is about having conversations, determining what makes a community and connecting with First Nations culture.”</p>
