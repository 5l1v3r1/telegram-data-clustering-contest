      <p>Ahead of the Supreme Court hearing of the joint petition against Maharashtra governor's decision to swear-in Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister, Shiv Sena has said the NCP-Congress-Sena alliance has 165 MLAs in its support.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut said, "Sharad Pawar is a national leader. If BJP is trying to form the government, it will not happen. It is a wrong step taken by BJP and Ajit Pawar. 165 MLAs are with Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP."</p>

      <p>Sanjay Raut also said the November 30 deadline given to prove majority in Maharashtra Assembly is nothing but eyewash only to enable defections.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCP leader Jayant Patil, who was appointed the NCP legislature party leader after the removal of Ajit Pawar, has said NCP has 51 MLAs with the party. Jayant Patil offered a letter to governor informing Ajit Pawar's replacement as legislature party leader.</p>
      <p>NCP won 54 seats in the Maharashtra assembly elections, some of who went with Ajit Pawar to the early morning surprise swearing-in ceremony of Devendra Fadnavis and Pawar. NCP has said most of the MLAs who went to the swearing-in have come back to the party.</p>
      <p>According to party sources, Jayant Patil has claimed the support of 51 MLAs. He reached the Raj Bhavan on Sunday morning to present a letter to the Governor with the signatures of 51 MLAs.</p>
      <p>I have approached Raj Bhavan with the signatures of 51 MLAs. Governor is in Delhi, Patil said according to sources.</p>
      <p>Shiv, NCP and Congress on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of Maharashtra governor's move to swear-in Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar as the chief minister and deputy chief minister of the state.</p>
      <p>The newly forged alliance between arch rivals Shiv Sena and NCP-Congress has said they have enough support that will go past the required majority in the Maharashtra assembly and Fadnavis government has been appointed with unfair means.</p>
      <p>The three parties have also sought a direction to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to invite them to form the government under the leadership of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.</p>
      <p>Seeking quashing of the governor's decision inviting Fadnavis to form government, the plea said it is "unconstitutional, arbitrary and illegal", and violates Article 14 of the Constitution.</p>
