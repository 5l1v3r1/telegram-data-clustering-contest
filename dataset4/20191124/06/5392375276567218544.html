      <p>Chinese phone maker Huawei has been teasing the MatePad Pro for about a week now but that’s about to end as the high-end tablet is expected to officially launch tomorrow, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/18/huawei-matepad-coming-november-25th/">November 25th</a>.</p>

      <p>Either way, today’s teaser released over on Chinese social Weibo sees the upcoming tablet accompanied by a smartphone. More specifically, the phone sits on top of the MatePad Pro suggesting the two might be sharing some data.</p>
      <p>What kind of data will it be? We don’t know for sure but Chinese media claims it’s about the new multi-screen collaboration feature that came with EMUI 10. Which is basically an improved version of Huawei Share. Multi-screen collaboration offers seamless collaboration between PCs and smartphones. So, for example, with a tap on your phone, the display will be mirrored on the laptop in real time.</p>

      <p>Design wise, today’s teaser also confirms the punch-hole camera which we find in the upper left corner of the display. This should allow the tablet to achieve a very high screen to body; or at least that’s Huawei has been saying until now.</p>
      <p>Specs wise, Huawei’s MatePad Pro is expected to equip the latest Huawei Kirin CPU 990, a large display, around 10 to 12 inches, a maximum of 8GB of RAM and from 128GB to 512GB of internal storage. Additionally, we’ll also find a magnetic keyboard, a stylus and other accessories.</p>
