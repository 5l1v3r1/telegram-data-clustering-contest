      <p>Prospera Credit Union and Westminster Savings are officially united.</p>
      <p>The members of both credit unions voted overwhelmingly in favour of the merger, which was proposed by the boards of directors of both companies after talks began 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>The merger, which is the largest in Canadian credit union history, will become official on Jan. 1. At least two-thirds of both memberships had to vote in favour of the coalition for it to go ahead.</p>
      <p>The new entity will be known as Prospera Credit Union. Westminsterâ€™s branches are all in the Lower Mainland, while Prospera has locations in the Vancouver area and in the Okanagan.</p>
