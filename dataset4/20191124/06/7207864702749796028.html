      <p><b>Key point: </b>Maintaining military readiness is important to national security.</p>
      <p>A U.S. Air Force wing in Alaska managed to launch 24 F-22 Raptor stealth fighters plus an E-3 radar plane and a C-17 transport, all in quick succession.</p>
      <p>The dramatic "elephant walk" at Elmendorf Air Force Base was more than an impressive photo-op. It showed off much of the new, bigger F-22 force at the base, underscored the resident 3rd Wing's apparently improving maintenance capabilities and underscored the Air Force's evolving strategy for deploying F-22s and other planes in self-sustaining small groups.</p>
      <p>The Elmendorf elephant walk took place on March 26, 2019 during the Polar Force war game. "This two-week exercise gives squadrons an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to forward-deploy and deliver overwhelming combat air power," the base <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/JBER3WG/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=371261160269560">stated</a></u>.</p>
      <p>The two dozen F-22s that participated in the mass take-off apparently account for around half of the Raptors that the 3rd Wing's two fighter squadrons operate.</p>
      <p>The 3rd Wing in late 2018 possessed just 42 Raptors. After a hurricane devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida in October of that year, the Air Force began distributing that base's 55 F-22s to other facilities. Elmendorf got at least six F-22s from Tyndall's front-line 95th Fighter Squadron.</p>
      <p>The 43rd Fighter Squadron, a training unit at Tyndall, temporarily set up shop with 28 F-22s at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Air Force in late March 2019 <u><a href="http://www.airforcemag.com/Features/Pages/2019/March%202019/USAF-Proposes-Moving-F-22-Training-to-Langley.aspx?fbclid=IwAR1Tsrk0-ggb-3DzHH6hsX2WwMEGBO7MU9Fi9G50jZ1lfN5FjrOI2Iw8jmE">announced</a></u> that those jets permanently would relocate to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, pending Congressional approval.</p>
      <p>Langley, which was home to two front-line F-22 squadrons, also took in some of the ex-95th Fighter Squadron Raptors, as did the Air National Guard wing at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii.</p>
      <p>The Air Force in all possesses no more than 183 F-22s. Concentrating the roughly 120 combat-coded jets -- those with the latest software and weapons -- into five front-line squadrons instead of six actually has helped the Air Force to better maintain the complex jets.</p>
      <p>The Air Force never had enough Raptors to equip six squadrons each with at least 24 planes. Twenty-four is the magic number, by the Air Force's reasoning. Since fighters often operate in four-plane formations, 24-plane units can launch more sorties than, say, an 18-plane squadron can do.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a squadron typically can manage 24 planes as easily as it can manage 18 planes. Thus a unit with more jets makes more efficient use of its manpower. "Larger, traditional Air Force squadrons and deployable units provide a better balance of equipment and personnel," the Government Accountability Office explained.</p>
      <p>Maintaining five, bigger F-22 squadrons <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/stealth-shortage-air-force-cannibalized-stealth-f-22-raptor-squadron-45107">instead of</a></u> six smaller ones could help the Air Force to boost the flagging readiness of the overall Raptor fleet. Since becoming operational in 2005, the F-22 fleet on average has achieved roughly a 50-percent readiness rate -- one of the lowest rates of all U.S. fighter types.</p>
      <p>In 2018 then-defense secretary James Mattis directed all Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps F-15, F-16, F/A-18, F-22 and F-35 squadrons to achieve an 80-percent mission-capable rate by the end of September 2019.</p>
      <p>That was never really possible for the F-22. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson in mid-March 2019 <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/raptor-isnt-ready-americas-f-22-stealth-fighters-have-problem-47832">told</a></u> lawmakers that the flying branch's five front-line Raptor squadrons likely would fall short of 80-percent readiness. This despite the flying branch withdrawing F-22s from the Middle East, <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/stealth-surprise-f-22-raptor-has-left-middle-east-46312">ending</a></u> five years of continuous Raptor operations in the region.</p>
      <p>The Elmendorf elephant walk indicated that at least half of the base's F-22s were flight-ready on March 26, 2019. The 3rd Wing also mans a regional air-defense alert mission, which requires it to launch pairs of F-22s on short notice in order to intercept aircraft -- usually Russian -- that fly near U.S. air space. The alert mission likely prevented at least four Raptors from participating in the elephant walk.</p>
      <p>The presence in the elephant walk of one of Elmendorf's C-17s is notable. The giant airlifter is a key component of the 3rd Wing's plan for deploying Raptors during wartime.</p>
      <p>Instead of always painstakingly deploying entire 24-plane squadrons or even the whole 48-jet wing , as custom dictated , in 2013 wing officers wrote new procedures for sending a quartet of F-22s plus a single supporting C-17 practically anywhere in the Pacific region possessing a suitable airfield, all within 24 hours of the word "go."</p>
      <p>The aim was for the 3rd Wing, during wartime, to quickly disperse its F-22s across many bases instead of concentrating them at just one facility where they might be vulnerable to, say, a Chinese ballistic-missile barrage.</p>
      <p>The wing's <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/air-force-has-new-war-plan-china-thanks-f-22-raptor-37337">"Rapid Raptor"</a></u> concept really caught on. The Air Force not only applied the deployment scheme to the other Raptor wings, it also included other plane types such as the F-15C fighter.</p>
      <p>In simultaneously marching 24 F-22s and a C-17 -- not to mention an E-3 radar plane -- Elmendorf proved that, despite the Raptor fleet's readiness woes and ongoing relocation, the Alaska wing is ready to fight.</p>
