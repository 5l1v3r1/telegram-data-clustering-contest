      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a> was behind on all three judges’ scorecards when he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-ko-knockout-rematch-luis-ortiz-fight-boxing-11208276/">knocked out Luis Ortiz in the seventh round of their rematch</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The heavyweight champion <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/frank-warren-deontay-wilder-anthony-joshua-tyson-fury-fight-luis-ortiz-11200797/">set up a second showdown with Tyson Fury</a> in February after successfully defending his WBC title with another explosive knockout.</p>
      <p>But Wilder took his time feeling his way into the fight and hadn’t troubled Ortiz before firing off a game changing right hand.</p>
      <p>The referee called off the fight as Ortiz struggled to get back to his feet and the scorecards show just how close the Cuban came to securing revenge over Wilder.</p>

      <p>All three judges had Ortiz ahead after seven rounds, with Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld scoring it 59-55 and Eric Cheek seeing it 58-56.</p>
      <p>Ortiz appeared disappointed to be pulled out of the contest, but admitted he was surprised by how fast the count was.</p>

      <p>‘This is boxing, I told everybody that it was going to be him or me and that it wasn’t going to go 12 rounds,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I was clear-headed. When he said seven I was trying to get up but the count was maybe quicker than I thought.</p>
      <p>‘I’m ready for whatever comes about.’</p>
      <p>Wilder confirmed after his victory he would fight Fury next and explained why he couldn’t take any chances against Ortiz.</p>

      <p>‘With Ortiz, you can see why no heavyweight wants to fight him, he’s very crafty, he moves strategically and he moves craftily.</p>
      <p>‘I had to measure him in certain places. Some people say I can’t fight on my back feet but that’s my specialty.</p>
      <p>‘I had to go back and forward, my intellect is very good in the ring.</p>
      <p>‘I finally found my measurement, I saw the shot and I took it. He’s one of the best in the world, you’ve got to give him that.’</p>
