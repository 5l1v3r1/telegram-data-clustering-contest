      <h3>Mark Lawrenson is backing Manchester United to ease to a 2-0 win against Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils will return to Premier League action with a tricky game against the promoted side at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Manchester United signed off for the international break with a 3-1 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games to hoist themselves up to fifth spot in the table.</p>
      <p>The Blades are a point ahead of Manchester United in the race to finish in the Premier League’s top four this season.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have only managed to win one of their six Premier League games on the road in the current campaign.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Lawrenson believes Manchester United will secure a vital win at Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Sheffield United have been brilliant so far this season but Manchester United are starting to look like a better team, just because Anthony Martial is fit again,” Lawrenson told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50490801">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>“I know Martial can be very up and down as an individual, but just having him on the pitch seems to make a difference and United’s other attacking players – Marcus Rashford and Daniel James – are also looking very sharp.</p>
      <p>“I’ve already mentioned a couple of managers facing their old teams this weekend, but this game sees a return to a former club for a player – Manchester United’s Harry Maguire, who started his career with the Blades.</p>
      <p>“I think Maguire will leave with the points.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United finished in sixth spot in the Premier League table last season after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho back in December.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils signed Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire and Daniel James in the summer transfer window to bolster their squad ahead of the new season.</p>
      <p>However, Solskjaer’s side have struggled to find consistency throughout the current campaign.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United have only lost three of their 12 games since being promoted to the top flight.</p>
