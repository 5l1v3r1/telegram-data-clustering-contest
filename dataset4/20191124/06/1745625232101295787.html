      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/irina-shayk/">Irina Shayk</a>‘s latest Instagram upload is getting noticed for more reasons than one.</p>
      <p>The photo was shared to her page on Saturday, November 23, and was an instant hit with her 12.9 million followers on the social media platform. In the sizzling <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> post, the model sat in a chair in front of a brick wall. A glowing neon sign reading “something strange happened here” was affixed to the wall behind her, seeming to provide the only light in the dark room.</p>
      <p>The Russian bombshell looked smoking hot as she posed for the photo in an edgy ensemble that did nothing but favors for her incredible figure. The look boasted a white top with a low-cut, square neckline that flaunted an ample amount of cleavage – an NSFW showing of skin that her millions of fans hardly seemed bothered by. As an extra layer, she sported a black leather moto jacket adorned with silver buttons that glistened in the dim light.</p>
      <p>On her lower half, Irina sported a pair of ripped, light wash jeans. She sat with her long legs spread apart, allowing her to showcase her toned thighs in the bottoms that were slightly baggy, but still clung to her sculpted stems in all of the right ways.</p>
      <p>The runway queen completed her look with a pair of snakeskin riding boots that upped the ante of her ensemble even more. She wore her dark, shoulder-length tresses down, with some falling in front of her face. Luckily, her gorgeous makeup look was still within eyesight for her fans to admire. It consisted of a dark red lip, full eyebrow, and thick coat of mascara, all of which combined allowed her striking features and mesmerizing beauty to shine.</p>
      <p>While Irina’s eye-popping display was certainly deserving of recognition, there was one more element to her new Instagram upload that was sure to have caught the eyes of her audience as well. Sitting in her lap was an adorable puppy, which she cradled in her arms as the moment was captured.</p>
