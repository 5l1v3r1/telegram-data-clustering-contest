      <h1>People are going wild for Lidl's Christmas food - including pigs in blanket crisps</h1>
      <h2>And they're vegetarian</h2>

      <p>Christmas really is just around the corner, and now Lidl has launched a range of festive snacks to get you in the mood.</p>
      <p>The new range could be perfect for any family gatherings or Christmas parties - and it includes pigs in blanket flavoured crisps - which are suitable for vegetarians.</p>
      <p>The budget supermarket is also selling Wiltshire guinea fowl and black truffle crisps, but it's the pigs in blanket flavour fans are really loving.</p>
      <p>One fan said on social media: "Today I bought Lidl's pigs in blankets crisps, and they actually taste like pigs in blankets."</p>

      <p>But you might not want to eat too many, as an entire bag of pigs in blankets crisps contains 41.4g of fat. One serving  (25g) contains 127 calories and 6.9g of fat.</p>
      <p>Lobster cocktail, ham hock and Norfolk ale and Norfolk turkey with sage and onion stuffing crisp flavours are also available to buy.</p>
      <p>For those who can’t resist olives, bloody Mary or winter spiced flavours are priced at just £1.59 each, and pair perfectly with a mug of mulled wine.</p>
      <p>Cheese connoisseurs in search of the perfect addition to their cheese boards need look no further, as Christmas Spiced, Spiced Apple &amp; Pear and Fig &amp; Balsamic’chutneys are on offer - costing £1.19 each.</p>
      <p>All products are available in store now while stocks last.</p>
