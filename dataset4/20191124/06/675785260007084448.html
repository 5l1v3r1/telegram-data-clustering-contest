      <h1>Deontay Wilder KOs Luis Ortiz in seventh round to set up Tyson Fury rematch</h1>
      <h2>Wilder was well behind on the scorecards before he pulled out a stunning KO from nowhere against Ortiz</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:01:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder produced a stunning one-punch KO to stop Luis Ortiz and remain on track for his rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> .</p>
      <p>The heavyweight world champion had lost every round - and was losing the seventh - until he detonated his right hand and dumped Ortiz on the canvas.</p>
      <p>The Cuban, who had boxed superbly until then, could not rise to his feet before the referee finished his count.</p>
      <p>Wilder, who also beat Ortiz 18 months ago, is now expected to face Fury on February 22.</p>
      <p>The pair fought to a controversial draw last December with the Brit climbing off the canvas twice, including in the final round, only to be denied victory by the judges.</p>
      <p>The rematch had been agreed before Fury outpointed Otto Wallin in September - and before Wilder took on Ortiz.</p>

      <p>But the sequel looked in serious threat at the halfway stage with Ortiz winning every round as Wilder struggled to figure out the tricky 40-year-old.</p>
      <p>And Ortiz rocked the champion in the seventh session before Wilder finally found his range and landed a huge right hand which sent the challenger reeling backwards and on to the seat of his pants with just six seconds of the round remaining.</p>
      <p>Ortiz eventually clambered to his feet but Wilder was already celebrating.</p>
      <p>“With Ortiz, you can see why no heavyweight wants to fight him, he’s very crafty and he moves strategically," said Wilder.</p>

      <p>“I had to measure him in certain places. Some people say I can’t fight on my back foot but that’s my speciality. I had to go back and forward, my intellect is very good in the ring.</p>
      <p>“I finally found my measurement, I saw the shot and I took it. He’s one of the best in the world, you've got to give him that.</p>
      <p>“Next is Tyson Fury, that is settled for February and then I want a unification fight.”</p>
      <p>Ortiz added: “This is boxing, I told everybody that it was going to be him or me and that it wasn't going to go 12 rounds.</p>
      <p>“I was clear-headed. When he said seven I was trying to get up but the count was maybe quicker than I thought."</p>
