      <h1>Knockout! Watch Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz 2 full fight video highlights</h1>

      <p>Deontay Wilder (42-0-1, 41 KO) successfully defended his WBC heavyweight title last night (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) live on FOX PPV from inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, as he finished perennial contender Luis Ortiz (31-2, 26 KO) with a vicious knockout punch in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>With Wilder taking his time in the opening frames, Ortiz was free to move about and launch heavy power punches. Wilder ate everything he threw and taunted Ortiz for more as he countered with good jabs. The tides started to turn in the middle rounds as Wilder opened up. In the seventh, “Bronze Bomber” exploded for a vicious straight right hand as Ortiz was coming in and it sent the Cuban challenger to the canvas for the impressive knockout stoppage.</p>
      <p>Check out the finishing sequence below:</p>

      <p>With this performance, Wilder becomes just the sixth heavyweight in boxing history to successfully defend the title 10-straight times. “Bronze Bomber” also improves his career finishing rate to a staggering 97 percent, failing to stop only Tyson Fury and Bermane Stiverne through 43 professional fights.</p>
      <p>After the victory, Wilder confirmed that he will rematch Tyson Fury this coming February in one of the biggest heavyweight boxing fights in a very long time. The two undefeated stars fought to a draw in December of last year.</p>
