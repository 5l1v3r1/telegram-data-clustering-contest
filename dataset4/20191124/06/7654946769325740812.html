      <p>Video of NYPD officers pinning an apparently mentally ill homeless woman to the ground inside a Queens subway station and handcuffing her has sparked outrage among New Yorkers amid a string of viral subway spats with cops.</p>
      <p>The footage shows police holding the woman down in front of the turnstiles at the Jamaica Center station Friday morning while she struggles to break free, kicking her feet and flailing her hands.</p>
      <p>The cops then flip the woman over and handcuff her, all while she resists.</p>
      <p>“Let her go! It’s not right, let her go,” yells Narvin Singh, who shot and <a href="https://twitter.com/NarvinASingh/status/1197913663878967296">posted the video</a>. “Putting her on the ground is not helping her.”</p>
      <p>The officers were attempting to bring the woman, who police say is known to the Department of Homeless Services, to the hospital for evaluation in accordance with a state law that allows mental health professionals to take someone into custody if they appear to be mentally ill, officials said.</p>
      <p>A nearby woman can be heard in the footage explaining to onlookers that the homeless woman, who was reportedly living in the station, would be given help at the hospital.</p>
      <p>“Some people who are suffering from mental illness, and due to their mental illness, do not always wish to seek care, even when they are a danger to themselves or others,” said NYC Health + Hospitals President Mitchell Katz, who was on scene, in a statement.</p>
      <p>“However, in clinical circumstances, where someone’s mental illness is severe, the right thing to do is to bring them to a hospital so they can be appropriately evaluated and cared for.”</p>
      <p>The woman was not charged with any crimes, police said.</p>
      <p>“This video depicts collaboration between police officers and health care professionals, and shows the challenges they face every day,” an NYPD spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Hizzoner called the restraint “painful for anyone to watch.”</p>
      <p>“We have a moral obligation to help people get the care they need. It’s not easy — but it’s the right thing to do,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1198004795388448774">tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>The incident sparked online fury in the wake of a spate of public subway confrontations, including the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/arrest-of-brooklyn-churro-vendor-sparks-outrage-on-twitter/">arrest of a churro vendor</a> in a Brooklyn subway earlier this month and several caught-on-camera clashes with cops.</p>
      <p>Hours later on Friday, a crowd of two hundred<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/anti-cop-protesters-flood-harlem-streets-in-wake-of-subway-crackdown/"> took to the streets in Harlem</a> to protest police presence in the subways as part of a demonstration against Governor Cuomo’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/push-to-add-more-mta-cops-likely-to-balloon-agencys-ot-spending/">plan to add 500 officers to patrol the rails</a>.</p>
