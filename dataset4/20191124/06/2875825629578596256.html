      <h1>Marcus Rashford ready to step up and keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer safe from Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>United boss Solskjaer is under pressure now that Pochettino is out of work - but Rashford is finally showing what a special talent he is and can help Ole keep his job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:50:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:50</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>There is something a little odd about someone who has never won a trophy in his decade-long managerial career casting a shadow over the job of someone who has won two league titles in a managerial career spanning a similar amount of time.</p>
      <p>Yet Mauricio Pochettino’s presence will be felt by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer every time his Manchester United team take a misstep.</p>
      <p>If Sheffield United turn over ­Solskjaer’s side at Bramall Lane this afternoon, ‘Angry from Manchester’ will be on the blower to the radio station, demanding Poch is in ­position first thing tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Understandable. Those two league titles, after all, were of the ­Norwegian variety, and they don’t count.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer made a hash of the Cardiff City job, Pochettino took ­Tottenham to the Champions League four times, and to the final less than six months ago.</p>

      <p>Poch is considered one of the elite, Solskjaer is not. Simple as that. The United board – led by Ed Woodward – seem genuine in their long-term commitment to their manager, but if a poor run of results and ­Pochettino’s availability run side-by-side, ­Solskjaer will be under serious ­pressure.</p>
      <p>If there is one man who can ­ensure Solskjaer can stay relaxed, it is Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p>It might sound ­ridiculous to say this about someone who has only just turned 22, but Rashford is ­finally turning into the player most of us thought he would be.</p>
      <p>Finally? Finally? He is a rookie. Still learning, developing.</p>
      <p>True.</p>

      <p>But in February, it will be four years since he made his first-team debut. Now, we are getting ­confirmation of what a very special talent he is. Three moments stand out.</p>
      <p>There was the free-kick in the League Cup win at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>There was the stunning piece of trickery and acceleration that took him past a nonplussed Davy Propper in the Old Trafford win against Brighton.</p>
      <p>And then there was the first-time finish against Kosovo last Sunday.</p>
      <p>We have been hearing wondrous tales of Rashford’s dead-ball striking for a long time and he could have provided no clearer evidence of their ­veracity than at Chelsea towards the end of October.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We know how easily he can go past a player, but his embarrassment of Propper was jaw-dropping.</p>
      <p>Almost as jaw-dropping as his miss when given an open goal in the same match, a rick that revived the familiar debate about his predatory instincts inside the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Well, we had his most emphatic response in that debate when a ­Raheem Sterling pass was despatched without breaking stride into the ­bottom corner against the Kosovans.</p>
      <p>That is nine goals and one assist in his last 10 games for club and country.</p>
      <p>Rashford has always dismissed suggestions he should be more ­prolific, even though the past three Premier League seasons – 30-plus ­appearances apiece – have brought him just five, seven and 10 goals. He already has six this time around.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>With his country, it has seemed Rashford has been in direct ­competition with Jadon Sancho for the right to form a trio with Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>He has surely won that fight.</p>
      <p>And with his club, Rashford has now become the key, go-to player every United fan has hoped he would become – the player who will keep Ole in his job.</p>
      <h3>Bale controversy flags up bigger issues at Madrid</h3>
      <p>Gareth Bale should not have gone anywhere near that flag last week and the reaction of the Madrid media was understandable.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>But the flag covers up bigger issues at the Bernabeu – such as Eden Hazard (right) turning up for pre-season five kilos overweight. That meant a slow start to the campaign for the £150million signing, who – ahead of last night’s game against Real Sociedad – had scored just once and assisted four times.</p>
      <p>Most wondered how Chelsea would do with a transfer ban and without Hazard. But the Blues might have got a decent deal. Bale might not suffer the lion’s share of Real scrutiny for much longer.</p>
      <h3>Sarri vs Ronaldo: There can only be one winner</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri and Cristiano Ronaldo have been going to varying lengths to deny there is an issue between them at Juventus.</p>
      <p>Sarri has hooked Ronaldo in successive games and, unsurprisingly, Ronaldo did not look best pleased.</p>
      <p>And, despite playing for Portugal last week, Ronaldo missed Juve’s game with Atalanta yesterday.</p>
      <p>It’s all pointing to someone making a premature exit.</p>
      <p>And it’s more likely to be Sarri than Ronaldo.</p>
