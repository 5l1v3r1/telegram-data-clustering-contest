      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>NCP trying to push Ajit Pawar to resign as Maharashtra Dy CM</li>
        <li>NCP MLA Rohit Pawar also appealed Ajit Pawar to come back to the party</li>
        <li>NCP's Jayant Patil is also going to visit Ajit Pawar to convince him to return to the party</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is making last-ditch efforts to bring back Ajit Pawar to the party fold just a day after he sided with the Bharatiya Janata Party to form the Maharashtra government.</p>
      <p>Sources informed India Today TV that NCP chief Sharad Pawar's extended family is trying to push Ajit Pawar to resign as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and come back to the party.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar and his daughter Supriya Sule reportedly spoke to Shrinivas Pawar, the brother of Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Pawar's grandson and NCP MLA Rohit Pawar also appealed Ajit Pawar to come back to the party.</p>
      <p>NCP's Jayant Patil is also going to visit Ajit Pawar to convince him to return to the party. "I am hopeful to convince him to end his rebellion," Patil said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCP claims that it has the support of 51 MLAs and that the BJP will not be able to prove majority if an immediate floor test is ordered by the top court.</p>
      <p>Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut also claimed that the NCP-Congress-Sena alliance has the support of 165 MLAs and added that the BJP does not have the required numbers to form the government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>All eyes will now be on the Supreme Court's decision, which will decide the future course of action in the Maharashtra political drama.</p>
