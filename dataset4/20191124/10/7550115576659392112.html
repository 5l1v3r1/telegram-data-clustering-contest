      <p>Napoli are the visitors to Anfield on Wednesday for a crucial group fixture in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> before Brighton make the trip to Merseyside.</p>
      <p>If Liverpool can avoid defeat against the Seagulls, it will see them extend their unbeaten run in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> to 31 games which would equal the club’s longest-ever run without a loss in the top flight.</p>
      <p>But Klopp said: “I have no clue about the record. I don’t know what it means because I should think about it before I answer, but I had no time.</p>
      <p>“That will mean we need a result next week and I am fine with that because we really do need a result next week against Brighton, but before that we have to play against Napoli.</p>

      <p>“We are not there to break records, we are really there to get the best results over the full season.</p>
      <p>“If we break one or two records – good – and we will take that, but winning the next game is much more important than people saying in 10 or 15 years that was the record set by this team.</p>
      <p>“We really have a bigger job to do, but if one depends on the other, we take both.”</p>
      <p>The visit of Liverpool ended a horror run of fixtures for <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>, who faced <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Manchester City</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a>, Leicester, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a> and then the Reds in consecutive matches.</p>
      <p>Up next for the Eagles are more favourable games on paper against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/burnley">Burnley</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/watford">Watford</a> and then rivals Brighton, but manager Roy Hodgson reflected on very different times for the south London club.</p>

      <p>A lifelong Palace supporter, the 72-year-old reminisced on the days when the opposition at 3pm on a Saturday were not so attractive.</p>
      <p>“I go back a long way with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>. There’s probably still a few guys watching who go back a long way,” Hodgson said.</p>
      <p>“From teams like Barrow, Gateshead, Accrington and Bradford Park Avenue, which is what I was brought up on, to be playing year after year against Liverpool, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a>, Manchester United. That is in itself something you should appreciate and look forward to.</p>
      <p>“For this club to have seven consecutive years in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> is a good achievement but we are desperate to make it eight.</p>
      <p>“We are going to need to do that by getting points in the games coming up and not by beating ourselves up too much by not getting a point against Liverpool.”</p>
