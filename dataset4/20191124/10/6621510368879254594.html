      <p>Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan Sunday termed China Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC) as the topmost priority of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, she said this great corridor will open new vistas of economic development and prosperity for not only Pakistan and China, but also for the whole region.</p>
      <p>Not concurring with the US concerns on the project, she said.</p>
      <p>CPEC is a guarantor to our economic development, she added.</p>
      <p>She said China is a long-standing and deep friend and it has always supported Pakistan in every hour of need.</p>
      <p>Awan said Pak-China friendship has assumed a proverbial status and it is sweeter than honey, higher than the Himalayas and deeper than oceans.</p>
      <p>The special assistant said economic zones to be established under CPEC will generate job opportunities for the people.</p>
      <p>She said the commercial loans taken from China will witness a remarkable reduction in the months and years to come.</p>
