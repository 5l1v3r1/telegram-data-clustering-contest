      <p>Former Orlando Pirates winger, Sifiso Myeni, is one of the out of contract players who will be keen on a return to topflight football as clubs will be making reinforcements to their squads for the second half of the season.   </p>
      <p>Myeni has struggled for a club since parting ways with Bidvest Wits last year, leading to him putting more focus on his club Myeni XI, which is campaigning in the SAB League. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The 31-year-old is still keen on playing in Mzansi’s topflight, having shown that desire when he trained with Highlands Park, Chippa United and Bloemfontein Celtic in recent times, though there was no deal for him at any of those clubs. </p>

      <p>With former Kaizer Chiefs defender Tsepo Masilela having recently been signed by AmaZulu to revive his career after a long absence from the PSL, Myeni will be hopeful of also getting his chance in the coming weeks. </p>
      <p>Masilela had also been without a club since he parted ways with Chiefs last year.  </p>
