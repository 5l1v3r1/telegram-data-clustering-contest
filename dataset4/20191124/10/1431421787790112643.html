      <h1>Giuliani Explains His Trump-Ukraine 'Insurance Policy'</h1>
      <h2>Prominent Trump critic George Conway tweeted in response, 'I’m starting to think this is a parody account'</h2>

      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has been repeatedly implicated in the Trump impeachment hearings, said that his “insurance policy, if thrown under the bus, is sarcastic” and is about the Biden family not Trump.</p>
      <p>Giuliani tweeted Saturday, “TRUTH ALERT: The statement I’ve made several times of having an insurance policy, if thrown under bus, is sarcastic &amp; relates to the files in my safe about the Biden Family’s 4 decade monetizing of his office. If I disappear, it will appear immediately along with my RICO chart.”</p>
      <p>Prominent Trump critic George Conway tweeted in response, "I’m starting to think this is a parody account."</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Guardian earlier in the month, Giuliani was asked if he is worried Trump might use him as a scapegoat for the ongoing Ukraine scandal. “I’m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid,” Giuliani replied.</p>
      <p>Giuliani’s tweet coincided with a bizarre Fox News interview over the weekend in which he used similar language saying “the moment I heard Biden’s name, I told my colleagues, they’re going to try to kill me.”</p>
      <p>In an interview, Ed Henry asked “Are you afraid, Mr. Mayor, that you could be indicted?” </p>

      <p>“Oh, wow, how long have you known me, Ed?” Giuliani responded, “Do you think I’m afraid? Do you think I get afraid? I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very, very effective way. I was so effective that I’ve discovered a pattern of corruption that the Washington press has been covering up for three or four years.”</p>

      <p>Giuliani went on to say that if the Mafia couldn’t kill him, he wouldn't let the media either.</p>
      <p>“I expected, the moment I heard Biden’s name, I told my colleagues, they’re going to try to kill me,” he said. “Because they’re going to kill the messenger. But damn it, the mafia couldn’t kill me, your colleagues are not going to kill me.”</p>
      <p>Trump defended Giuliani on Friday, saying he directed Giuliani to work on Ukraine because of his reputation as a "great crime fighter".</p>
      <p>Amid scrutiny of Giuliani's role in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, Trump spoke by phone to Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends" program.</p>
      <p>He said he wanted Giuliani involved to battle corruption in Ukraine.</p>
