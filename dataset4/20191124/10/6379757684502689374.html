Participants are also expected to look into policy options to allow fully utilisation of agricultural opportunities as well as mitigating climate change,” he noted insisting the need for private sector participation.</p>
      <p>He was optimistic that participation of the private sector and financial resources institutions would facilitate investment in the sector especially invention of technology.</p>
