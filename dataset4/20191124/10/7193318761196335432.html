      <p>A federal jury has convicted Tommy Dean Bullcoming, a 55-year-old Hammon man, of first-degree felony murder in Indian Country and related offenses.</p>
      <p>The jury heard evidence that on Sept. 6, 2017, Bullcoming beat Linda “Lindy” Zotigh, his 55-year-old ex-girlfriend, in her Hammon home and then bound her mouth and wrists with duct tape.</p>
      <p>Using her Lexus RX300, Bullcoming drove Zotigh to a field and made her walk about 50 yards away from the road, where he stabbed her 48 times and slit her throat, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Bullcoming then drove Zotigh’s vehicle back to her home, which he set on fire.</p>
      <p>Volunteer firefighters from Hammon noticed fresh blood in the residence, and a special agent with the Bureau of Indian Affairs found fresh blood on the headrest of the vehicle, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>Both blood samples matched Zotigh, while blood on her car’s dashboard matched Bullcoming, authorities said.</p>
      <p>On Sept. 8, 2017, in El Reno, the Bureau of Indian Affairs arrested Bullcoming for failing to appear before the Tribal District Court for the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Concho on a charge of trafficking in controlled dangerous substances.</p>
      <p>He had scrapes and cuts on his arms, hands and legs, as well as blood on his belt and sandals. DNA analysis confirmed the blood on his sandals belonged to Zotigh, authorities said.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 5, 2017, Bullcoming pleaded guilty in federal court to possessing marijuana with intent to distribute. He was sentenced in that case to 10 months in prison.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the federal jury found Bullcoming guilty of first-degree felony murder, carjacking resulting in death, kidnapping resulting in death, and arson of a dwelling.</p>
      <p>The jury was unable to reach a verdict on first-degree premeditated murder.</p>
      <p>The verdict was returned on what would have been the victim’s birthday.</p>
      <p>At sentencing, Bullcoming faces mandatory life in prison for felony murder, carjacking, and kidnapping. The maximum punishment for arson would be 25 years in prison and five years of supervised release.</p>
      <p>He also could be fined up to $250,000 on each count and be required to pay restitution.</p>
      <p>There is no parole in the federal justice system. Sentencing will take place in about 90 days.</p>
      <p>The case is in federal court because Bullcoming is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, because the offenses occurred in Indian Country, and because the vehicle used in the carjacking had traveled in interstate commerce.</p>
      <p>Zotigh was also a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.</p>
      <p>Bullcoming previously served prison time in Oklahoma on convictions of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and drug possession with the intent to distribute, according to state Department of Corrections records.</p>
