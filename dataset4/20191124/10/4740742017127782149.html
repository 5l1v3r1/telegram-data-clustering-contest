      <p>Graham Coughlan has called for more support for his side following Bristol Rovers' dramatic 4-3 win over Shrewsbury Town.</p>
      <p>The result, courtesy of Abu Ogogo's last-gasp winner, moved the Gas up to ninth in League One, just one point off the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Post-match, Coughlan called for people to get behind his side as they attempt to maintain their form into the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think we're onto something.</p>

      <p>"Doing this job is really, really hard, you have to be a certain character to manage this football club.</p>
      <p>"I find it tough, I find the lack of support tough, but that dressing room is absolutely magnificent, they get behind us and run their hearts out for this football club.</p>
      <p>"I just wish people would give us a bit more of a chance.</p>
      <p>"Nobody else will do it so I may as well talk myself up because what we've done here in 12 months is absolutely unbelievable to be quite honest with you."</p>
      <p>Rovers have enjoyed a positive first half to the campaign but have been heavily criticised after the defeats they suffered this season.</p>
      <p>Gas boss Coughlan praised fans for their support at Shrewsbury, with their noise levels good all game, but he said his players need that sort of backing all the time.</p>

      <p>He said: "I don't get involved in politics but I'd like maybe a little bit of support.</p>
      <p>"I'd like someone to realise what sort of a job we're doing and a bit of moral support.</p>
      <p>"They were signing our names at the end which was nice but it's tough, I do get battered by the fans - that's part and parcel of the job.</p>
      <p>"I want to reassure them that I love this job, it's not going to be pretty or great every week, but we're onto something.</p>
      <p>"If we can get together as a football club and, if we can get a little bit more support, then who knows where we can go and what we can do.</p>
      <p>"The fans have been brilliant, they've been great, and on days like this it is enjoyable, but when we possibly don't play well, I'd love them to get behind us and cheer the lads.</p>
      <p>"They're good, honest, hard working lads and I can't speak highly enough of them.</p>
      <p>"Together we're stronger - if we're all together and all in this, then you just never know where we can go."</p>
