      <h1>Palma Hideaway in Mallorca is obscured from the street by a tiny tiled garden</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:00:24+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/ali-morris/" target="_blank">Ali Morris</a></address>
      <p>Architect Mariana De Delás created a green-tile garden to keep this <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/apartments/">apartment</a> – which was formerly a motorcycle workshop – out of sight from the busy streets of Palma, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/mallorca/">Mallorca</a>.</p>
      <p>Built from traditional Mallorcan limestone, the 92-square-metre Palma Hideaway is situated in the city's old quarter and was bought by its current owners as a disused motorcycle repair shop.</p>
      <p>It had a neglected courtyard and an entrance that opened directly onto the street.</p>

      <p>Architect <a href="https://www.marianadelas.com/">Mariana De Delás</a> was brought on board to transform the space into a peaceful apartment that optimised the building's lofty ceilings and outdoor space.</p>
      <p>She began by creating a new "garden" at the front of the building that provides separation from the bustling street. The lower half of a pinewood wall in the entryway has been clad with dark-green tiles to create the illusion of greenery, complemented by a couple of planters.</p>
      <p>A built-in bench seat has also been included in a nod to traditional Mediterranean courtyards.</p>

      <p>"As the existing ground-floor access door created a very violent connection between the road and the studio, it was essential to integrate an intermediate buffer garden area," said De Delás.</p>
      <p>"It serves as a way to get light inside and also acts as an acoustic and privacy barrier from the street."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The tiny garden sits behind a folding door made from perforated steel that allows the light to filter through while blocking the view of passersby on the street.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The apartment itself is entered through a second timber-framed glass-door that blocks out the noise from the nearby road.</p>
      <p>"The space between these two skins can be totally or partially opened, with a large number of variations to suit every need," explained De Delás.</p>

      <p>The material palette of green tiles and pine slats that are used in the garden is continued throughout the apartment, contrasting against the original limestone walls and traditional vaulted ceilings.</p>
      <p>The apartment's plan revolves around a single, diagonal partition-wall which is meant to serve as both a room divider and storage space. Its diagonal positioning also guides the eye towards the rear courtyard.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>To the left of the partition lies the bedroom, where the wooden floor has been slightly raised  – an attempt by De Delás to make the ceiling appear lower and thus create a cosier atmosphere.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the all-white master bathroom, the floor has been raised enough to accommodate a sunken bath lined with the same dark-green tiles that appear elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Social areas like the kitchen, living and dining rooms are positioned on the right side of the partition in an open-plan layout with polished concrete flooring.</p>

      <p>A kitchen island with a green-tile countertop and chunky pink legs that De Delás designed in collaboration with young Mallorcan designers <a href="http://2monos.com/">2Monos Studio</a> serves as a gathering point in the middle of this area.</p>

      <p>The living room and dining area are accessed through a wide glass-door. A small guest room and a secondary bathroom has then been created within a former storage space that also looks out onto the courtyard.</p>

      <p>Back in 2014, De Delás worked with Norwegian studio Gartnerfuglen to design the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2014/10/24/wooden-grooming-retreat-mallorca-horse-riding-gartnerfuglen-mariana-de-delas/">Grooming Retreat</a> – a contemplation space that a young equestrian could use before and after horse riding sessions.</p>
