      <p>Moon met with Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah in Seoul during Bolkiah's state visit to South Korea to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911051077230174-is-trumps-absence-from-asean-summit-a-sign-of-rising-us-disinterest-in-the-region/">attend the ASEAN-Republic of Korea</a> Commemorative Summit to open in the southern port city of Busan on Monday.</p>
      <blockquote>"Potential for cooperation is indefinite, ranging from cutting-edge industries such as ICT, smart city and e-government to the defence and arms industry", Moon said at the summit, as sited by the state-run Yonhap news agency, noting that the two countries had long enjoyed cooperation in the field of infrastructure and energy.</blockquote>

      <p>The two leaders agreed to explore "specific cooperation projects" in ICT.</p>
      <p>South Korea has been heavily investing in ICT since the 1960s and has emerged as a world leader in the sector. In late October, Moon said the government would be putting forward an <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911131077297492-iq-over-9000-russian-military-to-get-support-of-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> national strategy to propel the country to the forefront of the industry.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brunei has also been stepping up efforts to boost its ICT industries and is pushing for smart city projects.</p>
