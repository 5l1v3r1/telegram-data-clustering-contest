      <p>A <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MichaelJackson"><i>Michael Jackson</i></a> biopic is in the works from the producer of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bohemian-rhapsody"><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a>, Graham King. </p>
      <p>King has acquired the rights to make a film based on the life of Jackson in all its “complexity”. </p>
      <p>The producer has also acquired access to use all of Jackson’s music, with <i>Gladiator</i> screenwriter John Logan on board to write the script. </p>
      <p>King and Logan previously collaborated on Martin Scorsese’s Howard Hughes biopic, <i>The Aviator.</i><i> </i></p>
      <p>Jackson has rarely been out of the headlines this year after the release of the documentary <i>Leaving Neverland</i>, in which Wade Robson and James Safechuck alleged they were sexually abused by the singer as children.</p>
      <p>Jackson was investigated twice over allegations of child molestation. He was not charged in 1994, but he went to trial in 2005 and was acquitted on all counts.  </p>
      <p>According to a report in <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-movie-bohemian-rhapsody-producer-john-logan-graham-king-1202792922/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, the controversies surrounding Jackson “will not be ignored in a film that will span his entire life”, from his child star beginnings to the global fame he achieved through his music later on.</p>
