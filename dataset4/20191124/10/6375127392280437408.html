      <h3>GAPAN CITY – After initially asking the court here for a 15-day grace period within which to file their answer to the civil complaint for annulment of bank interest charges filed by the local government of San Antonio, the East West Banking Corporation has sought another 10-day extension to file their pleadings, from Nov. 19 or until Nov. 29.</h3>
      <p>In his complaint, San Antonio Mayor Arvin C. Salonga has asked the local court here to stop East West Bank from imposing a 7.25 percent quarterly interest rate on two previous loan agreements worth P106.58-million which was entered into by the past administration of former mayor Antonino R. Lustre.</p>
      <p>Those loan agreements, incidentally, are now the subject of a separate graft case filed by the municipal government against ex-mayor Lustre and 11 other individuals, which was ordered elevated to the Sandiganbayan and approved by Ombudsman Samuel R. Martires on June 11, 2019.  </p>
      <p>Pending litigation on the said civil case, Salonga also sought for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and of a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the bank from imposing the questioned rate, and from applying the acceleration clause, among other reliefs.</p>
