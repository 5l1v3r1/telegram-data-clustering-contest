      <p>A police officer ended up in hospital after being assaulted while on duty.</p>
      <p>South Wales Police confirmed that one of their officers was assaulted while making enquiries into an earlier incident.</p>
      <p>Around 45 minutes before the assault, a white van made off from police in Cardiff Road, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/pontypridd">Rhydyfelin</a>.</p>
      <p>A 28 year-old man was arrested in the early hours of Friday, November 22, in Oak Street, Rhydyfelin, after officers attended to assist the colleague who had just been assaulted.</p>
      <p>The man, who is from the local area, is currently in police custody and is being held in connection with a number of serious offences, including racially-aggravated public order and attempted wounding with intent.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said the officer went to hospital but was not seriously injured.</p>
      <p>On Facebook police said: "Nobody comes to work to be assaulted.</p>
      <p>"Around the clock, our officers are out keeping South Wales safe. But although what they do is extraordinary, being attacked is NOT in the job description.</p>
      <p>"Hoping our colleague makes a speedy recovery."</p>
