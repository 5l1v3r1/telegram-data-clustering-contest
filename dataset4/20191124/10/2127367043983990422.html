      <h1>India vs Bangladesh: Indian Pacers Hunt As A Pack, Says Bowling Coach Bharat Arun</h1>
      <h2>India's pacers dominated as they registered a 2-0 series sweep against Bangladesh.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:33:57+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Indo-Asian News Service</a></address>
      <p>It was once again the pace trio of Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami who stole the show for India as they <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/india-crush-bangladesh-claim-record-4th-straight-innings-win-in-tests-2137778">beat Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs</a> in their maiden pink ball Test at the Eden Gardens on Sunday and Indias bowling coach Bharat Arun praised the boys for hunting in a pack. "They hunt as a pack, they have their processes set and they take a lot of pride in each others' performances, not just in theirs, so that's the secret behind the pack. They work on the basics a lot," he said.</p>
      <p>Arun feels that the boys adapt beautifully and that is what sets them apart.</p>
      <p>"We are an experienced bowling attack, and the beauty is how quickly they adapt to situations. I thought they adapted beautifully to these conditions. New Zealand will be a good challenge and we are really looking forward to it," he said.</p>
      <p>India wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha also praised the bowlers for <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/live-score-india-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-day-3-match-live-cricket-score-updates-2137716">their amazing display</a>. "In the last 3-4 years, we have had an amazing pace attack, all 140+. We have been successful outside and at home. It has been wobbling and swinging all that, especially under lights. It's not that only spin is dominant now for India," he pointed.</p>
      <p>Commenting on <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/wriddhiman-saha-grabs-sensational-catch-goes-one-better-than-rohit-sharmas-stunner-watch-2136975">his own keeping</a>, Saha said: "I've never tried anything specifically for the conditions in terms of keeping, just tried to do the basics right. Bumrah is number one on the list - after that Shami, Umesh, Ishant in that order, but didn't really struggle much."</p>
