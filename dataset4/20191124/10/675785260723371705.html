      <h1>Sir Chips Keswick 'considering Arsenal exit' after Southampton draw</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are now six games without a win after their dismal 2-2 draw with Southampton on Saturday to extend the pressure on Unai Emery in the dugout</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:16:15+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal fans might be calling for Unai Emery's head but according to reports, Sir Chips Keswick was the senior Gunners face who was left considering his future at the club.</p>
      <p>Emery is under huge pressure as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager after moving to six matches without a win following a dismal 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were twice behind at the Emirates as relegation threatened Saints netted through Danny Ings and James Ward-Prowse - before Alexandre Lacazette saved his side twice.</p>
      <p>The result left more angry question at the door of the Gunners' boardroom - with chants of “we want Emery out” and boos at the final whistle coming from the stands in north London.</p>

      <p>And according to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1403184/2019/11/23/as-arsenals-chairman-considers-resigning-how-bad-does-it-have-to-get-before-emery-goes/">The Athletic,</a> Keswick has been left so upset by the constant blame aimed at the board he "felt compelled to consider handing in his resignation as chairman of the club."</p>
      <p>Life-long Arsenal supporter Keswick became the club's chairman in 2013, after he took over from Peter Hill-Wood.</p>
      <p>But his role in football decisions in nonexistent, with technical director Edu, head of football Raul Sanllehi, managing director Vinai Venkatesham, chief negotiator Huss Fahmy and Josh Kroenke making the key decisions at the Emirates.</p>

      <p>Keswick doesn't feel he should therefore take responsibility for the current on field malaise.</p>
      <p>Emery was given a vote of confidence during the international break, but with the Gunners seventh in the Premier League and eight points adrift of the top four, the Spaniard's position has been made less secure.</p>
      <p>Emery said after the Saints debacle, which was watched by many in the hierarchy: "The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility," he said.</p>
      <p>"I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>
      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>
