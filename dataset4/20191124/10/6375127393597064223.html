      <h3>IN the Philippines, an impoverished Southeast Asian nation of English-speaking and election-crazy people, the president and vice president (VP) may belong to different political parties.</h3>
      <p>Described as problematic, counter-productive and highly-impractical, the set-up prompted a veteran solon to propose that our next Chief Executive and VP should be elected in tandem.</p>
      <p>“We should adopt the American system wherein the president and the vice president are elected together as one ticket belonging to the same political party,” said Rep. Lito Atienza.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the American vice president presides over the 100-member U.S. Senate, according to Atienza.</p>
      <p>Atienza, a former mayor of Manila and now a party-list member of the House of Representatives, made the statement shortly after President Duterte said he still distrusts VP Leni Robredo.</p>
      <p>If and when given the opportunity, Atienza said he would push for the amendment of the Charter so that the president and the VP would be elected jointly, rather than separately.</p>
      <p>The same rule should also apply to provincial governors and vice governors as well as city/municipal mayors and vice mayors, said Atienza, a former member of the Bayanihan Dance Troupe.</p>
      <p>Let’s then revisit and amend the 1987 Constitution, which was drafted by a government-appointed commission during the incumbency of the late President Corazon “Cory” C. Aquino.</p>
      <p>We want to believe that Atienza’s move hinges on the greater consideration that his proposed amendment to the fundamental law of the land should benefit the country and the Filipino people.</p>
      <p>Baguhin na natin ang problemadong set-up para huwag ng maulit ang nangyayaring iringan sa pagitan nina Pangulong Rodrigo R. Duterte ng Davao City at VP Leni Robredo ng Naga City.</p>
