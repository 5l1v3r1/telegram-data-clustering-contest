      <p><b>Los Angeles - </b>Hollywood actor Daniel Craig, who has been playing the fictional spy James Bond in the popular film franchise since 2005, is "done" essaying the role.</p>
      <p>The actor confirmed it during an appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" on Friday, reports people.com.</p>
      <p>"Are you done with Bond," asked host Stephen Colbert, to which Craig, 51, replied, "Yes."</p>
      <p>"It's done," he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, Craig also opened up about moving on. "Someone else needs to have a go," he told German outlet Express, according to Esquire.</p>
      <p>Craig's last outing as Bond will be in the forthcoming movie "No Time to Die", which is set to release in April 2020.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, after wrapping up the film, Craig discussed his complicated relationship to the franchise.</p>
      <p>"This may be hard to believe," Craig told The Sunday Times, "but I love the fact I'm Bond. We're in rare air, making Bond movies. It is one of the most intense, fulfilling things I've ever done, but it takes a lot of energy and I'm getting old. I'm getting creaky."</p>
