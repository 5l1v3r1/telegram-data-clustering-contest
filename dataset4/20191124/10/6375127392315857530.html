      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:41:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/alfred-p-dalizon" target="_blank">Alfred P. Dalizon</a></address>
      <h3>A ‘One-Time, Big-Time’ anti-narcotics operations in Central Mindanao conducted by agents of the Police Regional Office 12 from November 18-22 resulted in the arrest of 32 suspects, one of them a known ‘high-value target’ and the confiscation of over P103,000 worth of shabu, PRO2 director, Brigadier General Alfred S. Corpus announced yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Corpus said that the conduct of the OTBTs in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in different parts of South Cotabato, Sarangani and General Santos City led in the capture of Benjamin Petines Jr., a 45-year old ‘HVT’ from Lantana Subdivision, Barangay Cannery Site in Polomolok, South Cotabato.</p>
      <p>The official said that Petines was arrested by members of the PRO12 Regional Drug Enforcement Unit during a buy-bust operation around 8 a.m. last Friday.</p>
      <p>He said that Petines has been under surveillance by the PRO12 RDEU for quite a long time until the actual entrapment operation was hatched.</p>
      <p>Recovered from the suspect’s possession were 14 heat-sealed plastic sachets containing some five grams of the so-called ‘poor man’s cocaine’ worth P60,000, several drug paraphernalia and the marked money paid to him by an undercover officer.</p>
      <p>The suspect’s two motorcycles were also impounded by the RDEU, Corpus added.</p>
      <p>The PRO12 director said that the week-long anti-drug operations likewise led in the arrest of 31 street-level drug personalities and the seizure of more than P43,000 worth of shabu.</p>
      <p>Corpus said that South Cotabato policemen made the biggest number of drug-related arrests.</p>
      <p>“The increasing numbers of the arrested drug personalities is an achievement for PRO 12, In just 1-week,  around P103,000 worth of illegal drugs  and 32 arrests, one of them an HVT seems to be large number. But more than numbers, our main goal is to put this lawless elements behind bars and totally eliminate the trafficking and use of illegal drugs in the region,” Corpus said.</p>
