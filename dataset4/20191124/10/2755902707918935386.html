      <p>Flamboyant businessman Frank Buyanga’s child custody battle with ex-girlfriend, Chantelle Muteswa, has escalated to alarming levels as Buyanga appears to issue a subtle threat to the first family.</p>
      <p>Buyanga’s company African Medallion Group (AMG) issued a subtle threat to the First Family warning that the company would hold the family responsible if anything happens to Buyanga. This comes as the First Lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa was alleged to have waded into the custody fight on Chantelle’s side.</p>
      <p>According to online publication, <a href="https://www.zimlive.com/2019/11/24/buyangas-amg-issues-stern-warning-to-interfering-auxillia-mnangagwa/">Zimlive</a>, the first lady demanded Buyanga’s arrest. She allegedly advised Chantelle to approach the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and to report all the magistrates and judges who had ruled in favour of Buyanga.</p>
      <p>In a strongly worded letter, AMG claimed that Buyanga’s lawyer in the custody case was abducted by alleged state agents.</p>
      <p>Below is the full letter from AMG,</p>
      <aside>AFRICAN MEDALLION GROUP LTD<br/>9th Floor Maeva Tower, Car Silicon Ave &amp; Bank St.<br/>Ebene 72201.<br/>Mauritius<br/>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN<br/>Friday 22 November 2019<br/>RE: STATE INTERFERENCE IN JUDICIARY<br/>African Medallion Group has been informed of allegations pointing to agents of members of the first family in Zimbabwe that have attempted to interfere in the Judicial process in regards to the personal custody matters of our founding member Mr Frank Buyanga Sadia for their own personal and/or political motives.<br/>Additionally, one of the female legal representatives of the African Medallion Group assisting Mr Frank Buyanga Sadiq with his personal custody matter in Zimbabwe was recently abducted.<br/>The matter was reported to Highlands Police Station, and until now no meaningful investigations have been made. It is our view that this abduction may have been caused by the same elements trying to interfere with the Judicial process.<br/>These tactics to attack our Founder by using his innocent 5-year-old child and the mother to further their cause are in our view nothing less than cheap and inhumane.<br/>In light of what has transpired and is alleged, African Medallion Group is issuing a stem warning that should anything happen to our Founder Mr Buyanga Sadiqi, we will hold members of the first family and all their agents fully accountable and responsible.<br/>If these shenanigans continue, African Medallion Group will release evidence whereby these agents have been instructed to create false information regarding our Founder to interfere with his credibility as well as the custody matter.<br/>Such evidence will reveal the shenanigans that these agents and the first family is involved in to further their political influences.<br/>This mischievous conduct and attempted interference by the State with the Judiciary is one of a dictatorship and not democracy and undermines the Constitution as enshrined by the people of Zimbabwe.<br/>In light of these events, it is our stern view that this mischievous conduct of these agents and the first family should immediately be ceased.<br/>We remind these Executives that the Constitution provides clearly that the Judiciary is independent, and impartiality of the Judiciary is central to the law of Zimbabwe and Democratic Governance and that neither the State nor any institution or agency of the Government at any level may interfere with the functioning of the courts.<br/>We believe that despite the alleged attempts of the first family and these agents to interfere with the Judicial process of Mr Buyanga Sadiq’s personal custody matter, that the Judiciary has remained independent and we commend them for this.<br/>Regards,<br/>African Medallion Group Members</aside>
