      <p>Strictly Come Dancing fans have been left in shock after a spoiler leaked this week's result ahead of Sunday night's show.</p>
      <p>As has became the norm for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> , given that its results are actually filmed on a Saturday night, hours after the live broadcast has finished, the outcome of this week's dance-off has already been revealed.</p>
      <p>News of who was the latest couple to be eliminated from the BBC ballroom hit social media just before midnight and, while we won't reveal who has left Strictly, the identity of the couples in the bottom two has stunned viewers.</p>
      <p>This series of Strictly has become a hot bed of shock results.</p>
      <p>Early favourite Dev Griffin took a very unexpected early exit while last week, frontrunner Michelle Visage was voted out.</p>
      <p>And, just like seven days ago, Strictly fans have taken to Twitter stunned by the leaked result from this week.</p>
      <p>One fan ranted "Really not happy with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/strictlyspoiler?src=hashtag_click">#strictlyspoiler</a> ...thats the end of strictly 2019 for me now will watch the wee group dance in the final and ITT on Monday but I’m done ridiculous."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Correct result. Wrong two in the dance off but the right person went," and a third simply commented "are u f***** kidding me."</p>
      <p>Making reference to the fact that Sunday's results show is actually filmed on Saturday and stating a case for that to change, another viewer tweeted "who else thinks they should do the results on Saturday night they’re not fooling anyone."</p>
      <p>Another angry person said: "We made an executive decision weeks ago - along I suspect with thousands of others, to stop watching it. This is without doubt the worst season ever, for a number of reasons."</p>
