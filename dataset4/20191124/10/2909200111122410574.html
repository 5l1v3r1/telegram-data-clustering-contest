      <p>Private Legal practitioner, Maurice Ampaw has observed that government and security agencies are treating the Western Togoland secessionists with kid gloves.</p>
      <p>He disclose that the Homeland Study Group led by Charles Komi Kudzordzi affectionately called Papavi Kudzordzi has gained the notoriety in engaging in the latest acts because the security agencies are refusing to deal well with them.</p>
      <p>“I blame President Akufo-Addo and his government, the Minister of Defense, Foreign Affairs Minister and the Attorney General should all share in the blame. If the security agencies had dealt well with the leader of the group, he would not have had the nerves to go declaring independence for Western Togoland”, he disclosed on Kumasi-based Otec Fm monitored by MyNewsGh.com.</p>
      <p>Mr. Maurice Ampaw disclosed the current administration instead of dealing with the situation head on, was worried its political opponents may make mincemeat out of it and therefore handled the situation with kid gloves only to be overwhelmed by current happenings.</p>
      <p>“You arrested them and freed them so they have been emboldened. They are of the view that nothing can happen to them. If they succeed they are taking some resources from the country and I would ask government to attach seriousness to the matter”, he revealed.</p>
      <p>The Homeland Study Group Foundation declared independence for the Volta, and parts of the Northern, North Eastern and Upper East Regions after its meeting held in Ho a week ago.</p>
      <p>The Ho District Court has however ordered the arrest of the leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF), Charles Kwame Kudzodzi and two others over their unlawful declaration of parts of the Volta Region as a sovereign state.<br/><br/>This was after eleven were arrested and 5 other members of the group were put before court for taking part in the activity, AdomNews Mubarak Yakubu has reported.</p>
      <p>The five have been charged with treason and have been remanded into prison custody until December 4, after the prosecution told the court that they would be needed to assist with investigations.</p>
