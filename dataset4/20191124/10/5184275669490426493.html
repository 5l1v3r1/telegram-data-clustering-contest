      <p>Filmmaker and writer Tahira Kashyap Khurrana feels it is important for people to believe in themselves.</p>
      <p>“We all have the power to change and I strongly believe that we are born with super powers just like The Powerpuff Girls. We must tap into that part of ourselves more often, which stems from wisdom, self-belief and faith,” Tahira said while lending her support to Cartoon Network’s campaign #PowerToChange.</p>

      <p>“The Powerpuff Girls have inspired me tremendously. I relate to them because of their leadership qualities, team work and the way they believe in spreading happiness.
