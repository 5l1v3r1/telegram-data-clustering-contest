      <p>A MAN HAS been charged with human trafficking offences in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese nationals in a lorry trailer found in Essex on 23 October.</p>
      <p>Christopher Kennedy (23) was arrested on Friday and has now been charged, Essex Police confirmed today.</p>
      <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised charges of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of people with a view to exploitation and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, of Corkley Road in Darkley, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court tomorrow.</p>
      <p>A number of other people have been arrested in the UK and Vietnam in connection to the incident and some are facing charges.</p>
      <p>The driver of the lorry, Maurice ‘Mo’ Robinson (25) from Northern Ireland, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Extradition proceedings have been launched in Ireland to bring Eamonn Harrison (22) from Mayobridge in Newry, Co Down, to the UK. He is alleged to have delivered the trailer in which the people were found dead.</p>
      <p>He appeared before the <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/man-charged-with-manslaughter-essex-modest-means-4887065-Nov2019/">Central Criminal Court</a> on Thursday after he was arrested on a European arrest warrant in respect of 39 counts of manslaughter, one count of human trafficking and one count of assisting unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>Detectives have also urged Ronan Hughes (40) and his brother Christopher (34) from Armagh to hand themselves in. They are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
