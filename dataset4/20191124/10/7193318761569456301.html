      <p>Many Oklahoma-based oil and natural gas operators are testing the air as the nation’s climate change debate continues.</p>
      <p>Some such as Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy have evaluated how a future environment, where a constrained carbon use exists, would impact their businesses.</p>
      <p>Various companies also have implemented programs that surpass current requirements for methane emissions controls at oil and natural gas production and shipping locations.</p>
      <p>Publicly traded companies, in particular, are taking those steps voluntarily before shareholder initiatives make them required.</p>
      <p>“We recognize that reducing methane emissions is important to all of our stakeholders,” Devon CEO Dave Hager said.</p>
      <p>A carbon-restrained future, Hager and other executives know, could impact oil and gas producers’ bottom lines.</p>
      <p>Climate change risks, Devon’s assessment found, could affect business operations, capital investments, long-range planning and worker health and safety.</p>
      <p>Companies, for example, could be sued for not mitigating climate change impacts.</p>
      <p>Businesses could be required to spend additional cash to limit greenhouse gas emissions or to better conserve water, and could lose revenues because of rising sea levels or extreme heat waves.</p>
      <p>Market supply and demand fundamentals could be affected by constrained carbon requirements, and companies could lose investors or face increasingly hostile public perceptions for failing to address the issue.</p>
      <p>Devon noted proponents of tighter greenhouse gas emission standards also have proposed and support various initiatives that restrict companies’ abilities to extract and move fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>These include a drilling ban in New York, a hydraulic fracturing ban in Maryland, increased drilling setback requirements in Colorado and organized efforts that have opposed pipeline projects in many parts of the nation, including Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>While Devon’s 2018 assessment concludes oil and natural gas will remain crucial to meeting global energy demands even in a carbon-constrained future and that its assets would remain profitable, it also notes all types of initiatives aimed at regulating access to oil and natural gas supplies increase the cost of production and resource development.</p>
      <p>“Devon plans to closely monitor climate change-related impacts in the market and policy environment and to remain prepared to adapt,” its report states.</p>
      <p>Chesapeake’s assessment evaluates its projected performance in a lower-carbon future as well.</p>
      <p>Like Devon, Chesapeake expects companies with high-quality assets will remain competitive, even in a carbon-constrained world.</p>
      <p>It also highlights the role researchers say natural gas already is playing in addressing environmental concerns, noting emissions declined about 30% in the U.S. between 2005 and 2017, largely because of coal plant retirements where capacity was replaced by natural gas-fired generating stations (and renewable sources).</p>
      <p>The report states research published in Environmental Science and Technology estimates 2017 carbon dioxide emission levels already reached the 2025 emissions reduction target as outlined in the former Clean Power Plan as finalized under the Obama administration as to meet Paris Agreement goals.</p>
      <p>Other local public oil and gas operators also are keeping a close eye on the issue.</p>
      <p>Companies note cap and trade and/or carbon tax programs, frequent topics of debates among Democratic presidential candidates, pose future risks to their operations.</p>
      <p>Cap and trade programs offer operators greenhouse gas emission allowances that are gradually reduced over time. While producers still can operate under that type of program, their costs to buy needed allowances climb.</p>
      <p>Likewise, a carbon tax also could cost oil and gas operators money.</p>
      <p>They also are concerned by divestiture campaigns that aim to convince institutional investors to sell holdings in oil and gas companies.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities,” one company’s annual report states.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recent developments</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Democrats continue to debate how to control climate change, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, acting on an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, put an additional spotlight on the issue earlier this year when it proposed rolling back methane emissions rules enacted under President Obama.</p>
      <p>The agency, which said proposed revisions would save the oil and gas industry millions of dollars in compliance costs by removing duplicative regulations, proposes two actions.</p>
      <p>First, it seeks to remove transmission and storage sources from regulation, including compressor stations, pneumatic controllers and underground storage vessels.</p>
      <p>It also would rescind methane emissions limits for producing wells and processing plants, but keep emissions limits at those in place for other ozone-forming volatile organic compounds.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, it proposes to rescind methane emissions limitations without removing transmission and storage operations from regulation.</p>
      <p>But top executives at two globally integrated oil and natural gas companies panned the proposed changes.</p>
      <p>While Staale Gjervik, president of ExxonMobil’s XTO Energy, said his company has made great strides to address methane emissions through voluntary efforts, he also said voluntary programs only capture a fraction of the industry’s overall emissions.</p>
      <p>“Full industry participation is required to maximize the benefits to society,” he said, urging that the current rules be kept.</p>
      <p>Gretchen Watkins, president of U.S. Shell, made similar arguments, noting methane emissions pose more of a hazard to the environment than carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p>In a post, Watkins wrote that strong, targeted regulations can improve environmental performance across the industry while spurring innovation and are an essential step on a path to a more sustainable future.</p>
      <p>“Methane emissions hurt our business, because it hurts the reputation of natural gas,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Don Santa, the president and CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said its members, which include Oklahoma City-based Enable Midstream Partners and Tulsa-based ONEOK, will continue to follow voluntary emissions standards it created, regardless of federal rule changes that might be made.</p>
      <p>Those commitments, Santa stated, prioritize continuously improved practices to minimize methane emissions from interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations.</p>
      <p>“Members of INGAA have agreed to these voluntary commitments because reducing methane emissions is socially and environmentally responsible, and good business for natural gas transmission and storage companies.”</p>
      <p>David Lawler, the CEO of BPX Energy (the U.S. division of BP), discussed the issue during the University of Oklahoma’s energy symposium in 2018, noting how his company was attacking emissions issues by redesigning production configurations and using drones to inspect oilfield equipment.</p>
      <p>"It's no secret that energy and environmental issues have become polarized over time," said Lawler, the brother of Chesapeake Energy CEO Doug Lawler. "Amid this polarization, BP hopes people remember energy production and reduced global carbon generation are not mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>"It comes back to a leadership issue. If all of us will pause and think about where we're going other than single-well economics, then you search for and find dollars in the budget to support what is important for the world, not just the company."</p>
      <p>Environmentalists, meanwhile, have argued that voluntary emissions control programs accomplish little more than making operators appear as if they are concerned about the issue.</p>
      <p>Johnson Bridgwater, director of the Sierra Club’s Oklahoma chapter, said oil and gas operators and investor-owned utilities are major contributors to global climate change and will never get serious about controlling emissions unless they are forced.</p>
      <p>“We are talking about companies whose No. 1 motive is profit,” Bridgwater said. “Trying to get those companies to voluntarily cut into their bottom line to solve this problem, to us, is moronic.”</p>
      <p>Bridgwater said the Trump administration so far has launched efforts to either rollback or eliminate about 60 climate change initiatives that were achieved under the Obama administration.</p>
      <p>He said it appears to environmentalists that corporate leaders are controlling the administration’s agenda and preventing the United States from doing its part to address the global warming issue.</p>
      <p>“There is a fundamental disconnect there when you have the people causing the problem being in charge of fixing it when their profit motive is their clear concern,” he said.</p>
      <p>“All forms of fossil fuels are driving climate change,” he said, adding that money must be “removed from the equation” to make meaningful progress in slowing global warming both globally and here at home.</p>
      <p>He observed that renewable energy sources could be massively ramped up if policies required it, noting that civilization has transitioned through its use of numerous basic energy sources in the past, with jobs and markets following along as new technologies were introduced.</p>
      <p>He also observed that Oklahoma’s renewable energy business already is changing the marketplace locally and creating jobs.</p>
      <p>“The problem is there is no will among current politicians to make this happen as fast as it is needed,” Bridgwater said.</p>
      <p>“As for the companies, this isn’t about their corporate profits now. It is about what type of world their grandchildren are going to be living in 30 to 50 years from now.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Operational steps</b>
      </p>
      <p>In its support for the EPA’s proposed rule revisions, the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma noted operators it represents are working hard to control emissions.</p>
      <p>The alliance stated the proposed rule changes would allow the industry to “focus on market-based solutions by removing duplicative and costly barriers to development and making it easier for operators to gain approvals for new, innovative technologies that reduce emissions.”</p>
      <p>Chesapeake Energy, for example, voluntarily makes spot emission checks at select locations annually, using infrared cameras. The company’s lease operators also are trained to regularly use their ears, noses and eyes to identify potential emissions problems.</p>
      <p>It also uses an asset management program that standardizes work orders for operational and maintenance activities and generates data that can be used to analyze trends it uses to improve preventive measures at all of its locations.</p>
      <p>Plus, it uses automated tank gauging, remote monitoring and vapor recovery systems, solar and grid-provided power, centralized production sites and alternative diesel fuels to lessen environmental impacts.</p>
      <p>The company has reduced its methane loss rate for consecutive years, estimating it was 0.14% in 2018.</p>
      <p>“In any scenario, our commitment remains the same — to be constantly improving stewards of our assets and the environment,” its report states.</p>
      <p>Devon, meanwhile, has participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project for 15 years and has published a report annually on efforts it has made to identify and control emissions at its locations that involve fuel combustion, flaring, venting and storage losses and electricity consumption.</p>
      <p>It aims to avoid venting and limit flaring at all locations, and strives to capture and retain as much natural gas as possible through continually evaluating and optimizing facility designs.</p>
      <p>It also uses pressure-relief valves to minimize tank releases, uses vapor-recovery equipment to capture flash gas emissions and uses green completions during flowback operations.</p>
      <p>Where flaring is unavoidable, it uses equipment to destroy the gas, rather than venting it to the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the company announced it plans to further lower detectable emissions at production sites by at least 12.5% in six years as it continues to use its infrared camera-based detection and repair process to find and address problems.</p>
      <p>That process, the company stated, helps its risk management and operational teams establish best management practices and identify technological, material and equipment upgrades to better control methane emissions.</p>
      <p>Company officials also stated Devon’s process is comprehensive and transparent because it tracks emissions across all its operated assets, even those where reporting isn’t required by the EPA.</p>
      <p>“Environmental stewardship is one of Devon’s core values,” Hager said. “We’re always focused on doing what is right, while providing affordable, reliable energy to power our world.”</p>
