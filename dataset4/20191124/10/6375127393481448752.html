      <h3>SENATOR Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said that he continues to support Vice President Leni Robredo as the new drug czar.</h3>
      <p>The Senator encouraged her to fulfil her duty and go after drug lords so that their numbers will diminish under her watch.</p>
      <p>“Suportado ko siya basta ‘wag lang paparamihin ang mga drug lords, ‘wag (mong) hayaan na madagdagan ang mga drug lords,” Go told reporters in an interview after his visit to fire victims in Mandaue City, Cebu.</p>
      <p>In addition, the senator  challenged Robredo to exert more effort in fulfilling her new role as the co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs which she accepted few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The senator added that Robredo should be ready to “kill” drug lords if necessary. “Kung kaya mong patayin ang mga drug lords, patayin mo. At kung hindi naman, sabihin mo na lang sa amin,” Go said addressing to Robredo.</p>
      <p>Go also urged Robredo to curb the number of innocent people victimized by drug criminals.  </p>
      <p>According to Go, he, President Rodrigo Duterte and the rest of the administration are extending their support to the newly appointed anti-drug czar as long as the interest of the Filipinos will be prioritized.</p>
      <p>“‘Wag mo hayaan ang maraming nabibiktima na inosente dahil sa droga. Kung kailangan mo ang tulong ni Pangulong Duterte o namin, willing po kaming tumulong. Interes ng Pilipino ang uunahin natin,” Go added.</p>
      <p>Go highlighted that 82% of the Filipino people are satisfied with how the Duterte administration is tackling   illegal drugs. If Robredo can further improve the satisfaction ratings, said Go, he and the President will continue to fully support her leadership as drug czar.</p>
      <p>“Dinesignate siya ni Pangulo bilang anti-drug czar, full support ako diyan. Kung 82% ng Pilipino ay sumasang-ayon sa pagpapatakbo ni Presidente Duterte sa iligal na droga, baka kaya niyang gawin na 90% or 100%,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Go urged local government officials of disaster-stricken areas not to politicize the provision of humanitarian assistance to victims of natural disasters.</p>
      <p>“Sa panahon na may disasters, magtulungan po tayo. Kawawa ang mga kababayan natin kung pati ito ay hahaluan ng pulitika,” Go said during an ambush interview right after the turnover of financial assistance to earthquake victims in Digos City, Davao del Sur.</p>
      <p>Before proceeding to Digos City, Go made a visit to quake victims in Kidapawan City, North Cotabato earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Go urged residents to trust their local government officials, saying “Sa mga ganitong pagkakataon, dapat tayo magtiwala sa mga local officials. Hindi dapat hahaluan ng pulitika ito,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Kami naman, may tiwala kami sa inyong mga local officials at nakatingin kami diyan at ang taumbayan. Nakiusap ako sa kanila na walang pulitika. Ito ‘yung mga panahon dapat na walang pulitika, na walang pinipili. Eh, pera ng tao yan. Ibalik natin ‘yan,” added Go.</p>
      <p>The senator assured that he and President Rodrigo Duterte are  willing to help anyone, regardless of partisan affiliation.</p>
      <p>It was the senator’s third time to visit the victims since a series of earthquakes hit Mindanao in late October and early November.  </p>
      <p>“Para sa akin, importante ang buhay ng tao. ‘Yung mga gamit, pwedeng palitan ‘yan,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Tulungan lang tayo sa mga ganitong oras. Nagpunta rin ako para makapagbigay kaagad ng tulong at malaman kung ano ang pangangailangan nila. Lalo na ‘yung (pang)eskwela, para makabalik kaagad ang mga bata sa pag-aaral nila,” he said.</p>
