        <b>Dutch football legend Marco van Basten has apologised after using a Nazi slur on live TV while he was on punditry duty.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 55-year-old mocked the poor grasp of the German language of his co-host Hans Kraay by saying: “Sieg heil, not so beautiful, pancake.”</p>

      <p>‘Sieg heil’ was a known Nazi salute used in Germany before and during the second World War, and the timing of this comment was particularly bad.</p>
      <p>Teams in the Eredivisie this weekend took a stand against racism in football, but Van Basten’s comment suggests he perhaps wasn’t taking it seriously enough.</p>
      <p>He quickly apologised, saying: “I didn’t mean to shock people, I just wanted to ridicule Hans’ German, but I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>Van Basten is regarded as one of the finest players in his country’s history, having scored 24 goals in 58 caps for the Netherlands, including a memorable strike in the final of Euro 88.</p>
      <p>The former striker also starred for Ajax and AC Milan before injury cut his career short.</p>
      <p>This incident, however, could tarnish his reputation slightly as there is surely no place for reciting Nazi salutes in any situation, let alone on live TV.</p>
