      <h1>Aston Villa star Jack Grealish sends message to Tottenham playmaker Dele Alli</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:23:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Dele Alli shined for Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday as Spurs earned a 3-2 win over London rivals West Ham United in Jose Mourinho’s first match in charge – and Aston Villa star Jack Grealish has sent the England cap a message on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Alli, 23, provided the assist for Tottenham’s first goal as he slipped in Son Heung-min who lashed home. He provided some magic for the second, flicking through to Son who found Lucas Moura. Joe Cole described it as something “off the streets”.</p>
      <p>The former MK Dons star was also involved in the third goal which saw Serge Aurier produce an excellent cross to the back stick for Harry Kane, who continued his excellent form after a superb international break with England.</p>
      <p>It has been an eventful week for Spurs, with Alli losing a man he described as “a friend” in Mauricio Pochettino. But under Mourinho, he looked like the Alli of 2016-17 – and he posted on Instagram after the win over Manuel Pellegrini’s side.</p>

      <p>Alli will be desperate to return to form under Mourinho after losing his place in the England side. In just over six months’ time, the squad for Euro 2020 will be announced and Alli will be desperate to have earned his place back in the team.</p>
      <p>Another player that is looking to win a place in Gareth Southgate’s side is Villa skipper Grealish, and the previously-linked Tottenham ace sent a message to Alli on Instagram after the match – applauding his performance at the London Stadium.</p>
