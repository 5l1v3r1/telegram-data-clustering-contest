        <b>Netizens call Bhuvan Bam the male version of Alia Bhatt, minus his beard. Well, it looks like the comedian has accepted it, and his recent coffee proposal to Alia is proof!</b>

      <p>We often tend to come across the doppelgangers of our Bollywood celebrities, most of which are of the same sex. However, here’s an extremely hilarious exception. It turns out that the stunning Alia Bhatt has her male lookalike and guess who? LOL, it’s the popular You Tuber and comedian, Bhuvan Bam. As funny as it sounds, the netizens can’t stop but comparing the Student Of The Year actress with Bhuvan Bam, after a certain picture of him went viral on social media. (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/trending/trending-news/youtuber-bhuvan-bam-comes-in-support-of-ranu-mondal-says-she-didn-t-have-time-to-groom-herself/5dd5087087fb571eff7e4278">YouTuber Bhuvan Bam Comes In Support Of Ranu Mondal; Says She Didn’t Have Time To Groom Herself</a>)</p>
      <p>And, now, it looks like the comparisons have also reached Bhuvan Bam, who took to his social media account and asked out Alia Bhatt for a coffee date. Why? Because he thinks that has started looking the actress, whom he calls his crush. The comedian shared a picture of himself that had him smiling and with eyes closed. In his caption, he wrote, “@aliaa08 Please let’s go for a coffee date because I’ve started looking like my crush,” he added, “Please RT the photo tweet so that it reaches my crush. Make it happen twitter!” ROFL!</p>
      <p>Take a look:</p>

      <p>This, of course, came after a havoc of memes that netizens spammed Bhuvam with. Soon after the You Tuber posted his proposal, fans had some rib-tickling replies. While many laughed it off, a lot of them agreed and some of them also used the Kabir Singh reference, albeit with Ranbir Kapoor’s face instead of Shahid Kapoor.</p>
