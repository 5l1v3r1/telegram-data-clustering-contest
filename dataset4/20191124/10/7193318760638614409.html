      <p>ASTEC Schools next year will mark 20 years since it opened as Oklahoma’s first start-up public charter school. On the brink of that anniversary, Freda Deskin — founder and CEO of the Advanced Science and Technology Education Charter schools — recalls what led her to start the sixth- through 12th-grade school, which integrates technology and liberal arts in a research-based curriculum that inspires students to dream, explore and discover.</p>
      <p>Deskin was in her sixth year as dean of STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) at Oklahoma City University and had won a grant to take 40 Oklahoma County adjudicated youth through a four-week aerospace education program where they got to fly a real plane and more.</p>
      <p>She never will forget the chilling two-minute speech one of the participants delivered at graduation.</p>
      <p>“When I started this program, I didn’t care if I lived or died. … Honestly, I didn’t care if you lived or died,” said the youth, who used to hide under a hooded sweatshirt, but then stood proudly as a changed young man with a new haircut.</p>
      <p>At the time, Oklahoma City was building a new multimillion-dollar jail, and Deskin couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if that money instead was invested in education.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma had just passed legislation allowing for public charter schools, and Deskin’s own dream took flight. She took $70,000 of her savings and raised another $500,000 to found ASTEC, which started with a staff of five and 100 sixth- and seventh-grade students.</p>
      <p>From the school, which is located in the old Shepherd Mall at 2401 NW 24, Deskin, 71, sat down with The Oklahoman on Monday to talk about her life, including how her experience as a finalist for NASA's Teacher in Space Program launched her career focus in STEM education. This is an edited transcript:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us about your childhood.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m the middle of five children. My parents were Oklahomans; they met when he was on leave from the Navy and, after two weeks, eloped to California before his next deployment. I regard my most formative childhood years from age 13 on. That’s when we moved from North Hollywood to Lexington, near my maternal grandparents. My dad, who designed and built sets for Disney, was tired of the California freeways. In the two weeks before he was to join us, he was involved in a fire and fall, broke his back in multiple places and was hospitalized and in rehab for months; it was two years before he walked again. We went from having a live-in housekeeper and nanny in North Hollywood to us kids working summers in the broom corn fields — 12 hours, six days a week — to help make ends meet. My father went on to own restaurants and other businesses, and because of the grit I developed at an early age, I’ve never been unemployed since age 13.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When did you decide to be a teacher?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In sixth grade in California. I had a wonderful teacher, a retired military man named Phillip Wilson, who, through research-based teaching, brought the world to us. He taught me public speaking and more. My parents also placed a great value on education, though they didn’t earn their GEDs until my youngest brother graduated high school. In Lexington, we had a low square coffee table from which my dad every night would drill us on math problems and give spelling tests. He made up riddles — logic problems — and awarded a silver dollar to whomever figured them out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You were a classroom teacher for 15 years. What were some of the highlights?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My first year, in 1970, I taught sixth grade at Wheeler Elementary in southwest Oklahoma City. My salary was $6,000, and I had to fashion my own file cabinets and bookcases, even buy my own chalk. I had a class of 42 kids, four of whom still couldn’t read. To motivate the kids to attend and not miss class, I created a pirate ship-themed classroom, dressed up as a pirate with a saber and an eye patch and set up different learning centers for the kids to rotate through and see the world. When I learned one kid wasn’t coming to school because his hair was too long, I began cutting his — and others’ — with a straight razor, like I used to cut my dad’s and brother’s hair. Unfortunately, I couldn’t return to Wheeler for a second year and taught instead at a preschool. I conceived my son, and teachers then weren’t allowed to teach after their third month of pregnancy. Now that’s unconstitutional. The remainder of my classroom years were spent in Lexington, Garvin County and Pauls Valley schools where I also coached girls’ basketball, track and gymnastics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You were among the 10 finalists from more than 11,000 applicants for NASA's Teacher in Space Program whose winner, Christa McAuliffe, was one of seven crew members killed in the January 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Why’d you apply? How’d you feel after the crash? And where has that experience taken you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My students assailed me about the opportunity. They knew “Ms. D.” loved exploring the earth; they’d seen me out all the time on long-distance runs. Also, my dad was a pilot, and I was passionate about the future of technology. The last 20 finalists spent about a year and half, a couple of weeks at a time, at various NASA facilities including the Johnson Space Center in Houston. We had to pass a flight physical and there were some scary trials; one involving a centrifuge. We all were flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, for the Challenger launch. But when the launch was delayed for what was supposed to be a few days, I accepted NASA’s offer to fly me home and back a few days later, so I could get fresh clothes and brief my substitutes at OU, where I’d taken a faculty position to teach best practices and classroom management to teachers. I was at OU when a colleague laid his hand on my shoulder and gently told me, “the space shuttle went into the ocean.” I couldn’t believe it; I was supposed to fly back that morning for the launch. A kind TV reporter, one of the many who flooded OU after the news, invited me into his truck to watch the footage of the shuttle breaking apart and implored me to say a few words to the media. I couldn’t let people think that the explosion was not worth the U.S. continuing its space program. All of us knew our chances of not making it were 1 in 25, a chance we all were willing to take and which is a lot slimmer than dying in a car accident. Within a few hours, NASA sent a plane for me — and we 20 finalists in the years since have worked to advance aerospace awareness and curriculum, including establishing the Challenger Center for Space Science Education with experiential, hands-on sites nationwide. In 1987, I founded the Oklahoma Aerospace Academy summer camps, which evolved into year-round, comprehensive educational entities that were based at OU, OCU and now ASTEC.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us more about ASTEC, and what’s on tap for this fall?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We have more than 1,000 students in the sixth through 12th grades. We have a high diversity rate and 97% poverty rate. Incoming students are required to take nine weeks of character education, manners and etiquette. Almost without exception, our students enter far behind academically; for many, English is a second language. But we have a personal learning academy, where students work online and with teacher assistance to catch up, move into the appropriate grades and graduate before they turn 19. Seniors work a half day every day in paid and unpaid internships; many students have to work. We have 73 faculty and staff who, based on performance, earn $2,000 to $11,000 more than average teacher pay in Oklahoma. Our teachers aren’t allowed to lecture sitting down and their curriculum can’t be all lecture, but guided practice. Our superintendent, Shannon Grimes, and I meet weekly with our headmasters and deans of instruction to look at the data on grades and discipline. We’ve learned that if we don’t look at the data, we might think a problem is one thing when it’s something else altogether. We also dismiss early every Friday, for a half day of professional development for our teachers. Starting this fall, we’re adding pre-kindergarten through fifth-grade instruction for 325 students. Some 200 of our existing parents already have expressed interest in enrolling their younger children. Public charter schools in Oklahoma don’t receive ad valorem taxes. So, we must raise money to cover our facilities and rent, which is $1 million annually to lease our 70,000 square feet in Shepherd Mall. Today, the OSU College of Education partners with our foundation to help write grants and raise funds.</p>
