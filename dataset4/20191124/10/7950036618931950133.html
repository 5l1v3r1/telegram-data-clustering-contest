      <p>Almost 900kg of explosives were used to demolish the Bank of Lisbon building in the Johannesburg CBD on Sunday, an exercise that has cost the city R90m to date.</p>
      <p>Gauteng’s MEC for infrastructure development, Tasneem Motara, said she was pleased with the successful implosion of the building.</p>
      <p>“I must admit, I was a bit nervous when the sirens went off, but the demolition has gone successfully. There has been no damage to property and no-one has been hurt,” Motara told reporters in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>A siren wailed just after 9.10am on Sunday, warning those in the area that the building, which claimed the lives of three firefighters in a blaze past year, was about to be demolished.</p>
      <p>The building went down in seconds.</p>
      <p>The 31-storey building previously housed the Gauteng departments of health and human settlements. It was declared unsafe after the deadly fire.</p>
      <p>Motara said 894kg of explosions were used to implode the building.</p>
      <p>The building, which was 108 metres high, was the second highest building to be demolished by Jet Demolitions. The highest building the company had demolished was a building in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2014 that was 140 metres high.</p>
      <p>She said the department budgeted R140m for the demolition of the building and had spent R90m to date.</p>
      <p>The building would be rebuilt and form part of the Kopanong precinct.</p>
      <p>“The experts said that this was one of the most difficult demolitions they had to work on. This brings us to an end of an era.”</p>
      <p>She said the clearing of the site and the roads was already under way.</p>
      <p>“We have also been in contact with the families of the deceased. We will have discussions with the families to find the best way to honour them.”</p>
