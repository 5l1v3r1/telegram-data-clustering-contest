      <p>Because everyone wants to dine at the home of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, right?</p>
      <p>With an election looming and the country in chaos there is an upside to all the madness currently taking place inside the Palace of Westminster: over the next two months, you will be able to dine in style at the Member’s Dining Room in the actual Houses of Parliament.</p>
      <p>The reason we’ve all been given this rare opportunity is that parliament is currently not in session. Normally the space is reserved for MPs and their guests but because of next month’s election, the restaurant is, for now, empty.</p>
      <p>Why should you nab a spot at the parliamentary table? First of all, it’s a rare opportunity to eat inside the place. Whilst it is our constitutional right to be granted access to the palace, the invitation does not extend beyond the designated tour routes.</p>

      <p>Plus, the last time the country had a December election was way back in 1923, so yes, this is basically a once-in-a-lifetime gig.</p>
      <p>Price wise, the £55 (£45 for lunch) priced seasonal set menu is pretty decent. Celebrating locally sourced British produce, expect everything from venison to cord-fed chicken and halibut, as well as rabbit and beef dishes to start. For dessert, think a very chewy pavlova, a chocolate orange delice and lots and lots of British cheeses.</p>
      <p>Architecturally, the Member’s Dining Room is Insta goals. Tux and tail waiters hover in between white tablecloths and political-themed art-lined walls, along with other highlights such as high Victorian ceilings, massive windows (with views looking over the Commons Terrace) and some rather chic oak panels – it’s very pretty.</p>
      <p>Diners can currently book in for numerous dates for both lunch (12pm to 2pm) and dinner (6.30pm to 7.45pm) between 26 November and 5 December 2019.</p>
      <p>Dress code? Smart casual, but boys take note: collared shirts, long trousers and fancy shoes are preferred.</p>
      <p>Oh, and you can also get totally sloshed in the bar pre or post-lunch and dinner reservations. Cheers to that.</p>
