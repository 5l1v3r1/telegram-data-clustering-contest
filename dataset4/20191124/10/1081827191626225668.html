      <p>A mother has been charged with murder over the death of her two toddlers, who were allegedly left for hours in a hot car at Logan, south of Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Paramedics were called to a home at Waterford West in Logan at 1.35pm on Saturday after the sisters were found unresponsive in the car. The paramedics were unable to revive the one-year-old and two-year-old.</p>
      <p>Kerri-Ann Conley, the girls’ 27-year-old mother, was charged late on Saturday night with two counts of murder, police said.</p>
      <p>Police say it appeared the sisters had died of exposure to extreme heat, with yesterday’s temperature in the area being around 30 degrees.</p>
      <p>The police are still trying to establish exactly how long the toddlers had been in the black station wagon parked in the front of the property.</p>
      <p><i>Nine News</i> reports the mother had rushed the toddlers’ bodies inside to try cool them down by splashing water on them.</p>
      <p>“The two children exhibited signs of being exposed to extreme heat and that is forming the direction of our investigation,” Detective Inspector Mark White said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We are speaking to the parents of those children. It’s a very tragic incident which has occurred.”</p>
      <p>Police said they were offering support to officers who attended the scene.</p>
      <p>“It is tragic,” Detective Inspector White said of the crime scene.</p>
      <p>“We are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our people. It is very very tragic and can be quite a distressing scene to be confronted by.”</p>
      <p>“One of our priorities in addition to conducting the investigation is the wellbeing of our staff and our other emergency service colleagues.”</p>
      <p>Kerri-Ann Conley will appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>People are asking for any members of the public who have information concerning the deaths to come forward.</p>
