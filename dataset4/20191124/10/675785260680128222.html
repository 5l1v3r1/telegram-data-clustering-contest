      <p>Research by the House of Commons Library has shown that libraries, museums and art galleries across England have had their funding slashed by at least £640m since 2010.</p>

      <p>"Every child, whatever their background, should be able to enjoy the fundamentals in life and the access to the arts is crucial to that."</p>

      <p>The fund would be paid for out of Labour's £150bn, five-year 'Social Transformation Fund' which is set to be funded by government borrowing.</p>
