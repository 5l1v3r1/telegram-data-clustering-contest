      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-crown/">The Crown</a> season three launched a week ago, and has probably already been binged in its entirety by millions of fans.</p>
      <p>The season has been met with overwhelming praise, from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/olivia-colman/">Olivia Colman</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/crown-season-3-review-olivia-colman-reigns-supreme-queen-elizabeth-steps-back-major-plot-roles-11039940/">stepping into the role</a> of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth</a> to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/crown-season-3-praised-heartbreaking-aberfan-disaster-portrayal-11171015/">sensitive portrayal of the real-life Aberfan disaster</a>.</p>
      <p>But just where is the series filmed and is that actually Buckingham Palace in the show?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Where do they film Buckingham Palace scenes for the Crown?</h3>
      <p>Obviously the Royal Family weren’t going to permit Olivia Colman and co to come traipsing around their house, dressed as them.</p>

      <p>A majority of the scenes set within the palace are filmed at Lancaster House, which is owned by the Foreign Office and isn’t too far from the real Buckingham Palace.</p>

      <p>Wilton House in Wiltshire has also been used as a stand-in for parts of the Palace.</p>

      <p>Other interior scenes have been filmed at Waddeston Manor.</p>
      <p>For the recently-released season three, the University of Greenwich was used for the scene where Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance) visits Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor).</p>
      <h3>Where was the Investiture of the Prince of Wales filmed?</h3>
      <p>This is one of the occasions where the real life location was used.</p>
      <p>The Investiture of the Prince of Wales took place at Caernarfon Castle on 1 July 1969.</p>

      <h3>Where was Churchill’s funeral filmed?</h3>
      <p>In season three, viewers watch the Queen attending the funeral of Prime Minister Winston Churchill.</p>
      <p>In real life, this funeral was held at St Paul’s Cathedral. Churchill was given a State Funeral – an honour usually reserved for Royals.</p>

      <p>The Crown shot this funeral scene in Winchester Cathedral in Hampshire instead.</p>
      <h3>Where are the White House scenes filmed?</h3>
      <p>Season three sees <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/helena-bonham-carter/">Helena Bonham Carter</a>’s Princess Margaret travel to Washington DC to meet with President Lyndon B Johnson.</p>
      <p>Rather than send Helena overseas, the White House scenes were filmed at The Hylands House in Essex – which used to host V Festival.</p>

      <h3>Where were the Aberfan scenes filmed?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/crown-season-3-aberfan-disaster-11177479/">The Aberfan disaster</a> saw a coal waste tip collapse, sending an avalanche down the slope onto the village of Aberfan, tragically killing 144 people.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Because of the nature of these scenes, the filming took place a few miles away from the site, at Cwmaman in Wales’s Cynon Valley.</p>
      <p>For other scenes, sets were built to recreate 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Room.</p>
