      <h1>Star Wars: Every Disney+ Change Made to A New Hope</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:11:20+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bea Caicoya</a></address>
      <p>The entire <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> saga has become a part of Disney + catalog, but Disney didn't just upload the 2011 Blu-Ray versions of the movies to get it out of the way quickly. In addition to adding a newsmaking "Maclunkey!" to Han and Greedo's fateful encounter, Disney made several other changes to the film be it on its brand new streaming service.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at the most significant changes in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope/"><i>A New Hope</i></a> and the reasons behind them (in order of appearance).</p>
      <h3>LOGOS AND FANFARES</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>First of all, the on-and-off again 3D 20th Century Fox fanfare has been restored for the Original Trilogy. Disney had removed it from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/empire-strikes-back/"><i>The Empire Strikes Back</i></a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi/"><i>The Return of the Jedi</i></a> when it acquired Lucasfilm back in 2012, although it left it in <i>A New Hope</i> because Fox owned the permanent distribution rights for <i>Episode IV</i>. The only difference is the removal of "A News Corporation Company" line.</p>

      <p>Although this change is minor, it takes veteran fans to the moment the movies were released. The Fox logo and fanfare had been an integral part of the opening ritual along with the crawl, to such a degree that George Lucas actually asked John Williams to compose the crawl's theme in the same key for a smooth transition</p>

        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horizontal-Lucasfilm-Logo-1997-2015.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>However, the green Lucasfilm logo from 1997 was replaced by the 2015 version of the Disney era.</p>

      <h3>Maclunkey!</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/han-and-greedo-1-1.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=505&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The biggest change in <i>A New Hope</i> by far happens in the Cantina scene where Greedo, a Rodian bounty hunter, confronts Han Solo about his debts to Jabba the Hutt. This scene has been retouched many times: in 1977, Han Solo shot first, killing Greedo. Then George Lucas decided that this didn't fit Solo's archetype as a reluctant hero, so he had Greedo shoot first. Disney's version of <i>A New Hope</i> respects this creative revision and adds its own touch: right before Greedo shoots, he shouts "Maclunkey!"</p>
      <p>When fans (and the actors themselves, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-greedo-a-new-hope-macklunkey-paul-blake/">who had recorded their lines in English in 1977 </a>and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-bib-fortuna-trolled-greedo-maclunkey/">were not informed beforehand of any changes</a>) noticed it and took to Twitter, Disney confirmed the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-what-greedos-maclunkey-means-and-whos-responsible-for-it/">"maclunkey" addition was made by Lucas</a> before he sold Lucasfilm in 2012. However, the close-up of Greedo's maclunkey moment is not new footage, but a zoom-in on the same shot from seconds before, and it shows.</p>

      <h3>Color Corrections</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horizontal-Star-Wars-A-New-Hope-Obi-wan-Kenobi-Luke-Falcon-Disney-.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Due to how old and fragile the original footage of <i>A New Hope</i> is, it's difficult to restore and color-correct from the original film. Instead, it appears like Disney made color modifications from the 4K 2011 version, and this is arguably one of the nicest changes of all. Although the movie retains the grainy, old-fashioned shot-on-film aesthetic, the scenes are sharper, the colors pop, and the weapons gleam.</p>
      <p>In <i>A New Hope</i>, there are two scenes where this can be better appreciated. The first one is when Obi-Wan is training Luke aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>: Luke's lightsaber is back to being blue (in some versions it appeared as green). Every small detail in the room can be appreciated, which is essential for such an iconic scene.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The second one is when Obi-wan and Darth Vader's tragic fight. Not only do their lightsabers look sharp, but Disney has added a fine sparkly mist when they clash, and the cable attached to one of Obi-wan's hands, which could still be seen in previous versions, has been digitally removed.</p>

      <h3>Disney + Bonus Features</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horizontal-Star-Wars-A-New-Hope-Tosche-Station-luke-hat-Disney-1.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Disney + included six cut scenes under their "Extras" menu for <i>A New Hope</i> that were left out of the final movie. These are an alternate Luke and Biggs reunion, a small scene with Aunt Beru and her Blue Milk, a rough cut of the antina, the search for R2-D2, and Luke and his Tatooine friends at Tosche Station.</p>
      <p>The Tosche Station scene is particularly interesting, because it links Luke to the experience of a normal teenager, and introduces the idea that although he had a social life, he never quite fit in. It also introduces Biggs, the "big-shot" friend of the group, who Luke looks up to, and who later appears in Yavin-4 as one of the Rebel pilots who attack the <i>Death Star</i> at the end of the movie.</p>
      <p>All in all, Disney respected every single one of George Lucas' wishes and cleaned them up a little for mass consumption. Although the more orthodox part of the fandom might argue that the only good version of <i>A New Hope</i> is the one that was released in theaters in 1977, they'll be disappointed when they discover how difficult is to find a copy. For now, this is what we have, and it's better than previous versions.</p>
