      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Joao Moutinho scored and then celebrated with a new contract on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Moutinho has signed a new contract extension keeping him at Wolves until 2022, <a href="https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20191123-moutinho-signs-new-wolves-contract/">the club’s official website announced</a>. This came a few hours after he scored in Wolves’ 2-1 win at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international has been a standout performer in Wolves’ midfield since joining in summer 2018. He teamed up with Nuno Espirito Santo after their promotion to the Premier League and helped the West Midlands club reach the Europa League last season.</p>

      <p>Moutinho scored his first goal of the season against Bournemouth, adding to his tally of seven assists. The 32-year-old also weighed in with one goal and eight assists last season.</p>
      <p>Wolves fans are loving Moutinho’s performances and he is defying his age to remain an integral part of the team. Alongside Ruben Neves, Wolves have a midfield which is the envy of most of the division.</p>
      <p>After he scored and signed a new contract, Wolves fans took to Twitter to express their delight. Here are some tweets about Moutinho’s two-and-a-half-year extension.</p>
