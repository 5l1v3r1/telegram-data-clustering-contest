      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arjun-kapoor/">Arjun Kapoor</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kriti-sanon/">Kriti Sanon</a>-starrer <i>Panipat</i> is about to release and recently <i>Mann Mein Shiva</i> was launched. The event was attended by the actors as well as the director Ashutosh Gowariker. Sticking to the period film theme, Sanon was spotted in a Rohit Bal outfit.</p>
      <p>The black anarkali, clinched at the waist, had elaborate flower motifs at the edges. Styled by Sukriti Grover, the look did not work for it seemed too dated. Although floral prints are in, this seemed a bit off. The sleeves and the sweetheart neckline further made things worse. The look was rounded out with statement earrings, hair tied in a bun adorned with red roses.</p>

      <p>The actor generally aces traditional look. At the trailer launch, she looked lovely in a Raw Mango ensemble. Styled by Grover, gorgeous pink lehenga with brocade work was teamed with a black blouse and the combination really worked well. This was paired with a black dupatta and was accessorised with a gorgeous choker, earrings from Amrapali Jewels. It was completed with hair parted at the centre and smokey eyes.</p>
