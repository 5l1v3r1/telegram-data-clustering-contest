      <h1>Plane Crash in Congo Kills at Least 24</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:26:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — A plane carrying at least 18 people crashed on Sunday in the densely populated city of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, killing several people on the flight and on the ground, the provincial governor’s office said.</p>
      <p>A provincial lawmaker, Jean Paul Lumbulumbu, the vice president of North Kivu’s Parliament, said 24 bodies had been pulled from the rubble. But a rescue worker said 26 bodies had been found.</p>
      <p>Two people were rescued before the plane exploded, witnesses said.</p>
      <p>The plane, operated by the private carrier Busy Bee, was headed for the city of Beni, about 155 miles to the north, when it crashed shortly after takeoff into residential homes near Goma’s airport in North Kivu Province, according to the office of Gov. Carly Nzanzu Kasivita of North Kivu.</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Footage online showed smoke rising from the plane wreckage on the ground and parts of the fuselage resting on a concrete wall.</p>
      <p>Heritier Said Mamadou, a Busy Bee airline staff member, told reporters, “There were 17 passengers onboard and two crew members.” He said the plane had taken off around 9:10 a.m.</p>
      <p>Busy Bee has three planes serving routes in the North Kivu Province.</p>
      <p>The United Nations mission in Congo said it had sent an emergency team with two fire engines to support the Congolese authorities in the rescue operation.</p>
      <p>Congo has one of the world’s worst aviation records, with relatively frequent plane crashes caused by lax safety standards and poor maintenance. All Congolese commercial carriers, including Busy Bee, are banned from operating in the European Union.</p>
      <p>In October, a cargo plane departing from the same airport crashed an hour after takeoff, killing all eight passengers. The plane, an Antonov An-72 transport aircraft, crashed in a forest and broke apart upon landing.</p>
      <p>That aircraft, carrying President Félix Tshisekedi’s driver, a logistics manager and soldiers, was headed from Goma to the capital, Kinshasa, and went off radar an hour after departing, the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement at the time. An armored vehicle used by the president had also been on board.</p>
      <p>After news of that crash broke, local news media showed hundreds of supporters of Mr. Tshisekedi hitting the streets of Kinshasa, apparently fearing that the plane had been downed in a failed coup attempt. Mr. Tshisekedi took office in January from President Joseph Kabila, who governed for 17 years.</p>
      <p>The Russian Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo said on its Facebook page that preliminary information indicated that <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/10/11/russians-onboard-in-dr-congo-plane-crash-embassy-says-a67697">Russians were among the crew members</a> on the Antonov jet.</p>
      <p>The United Nations peacekeeping mission sent two planes and a helicopter <a href="https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/un-joins-search-for-missing-dr-congo-cargo-plane-20191012">to join the search for plane debris</a>. But there was no hope for the passengers.</p>
      <p>“There are no survivors; the bodies were all burnt to ashes,” a presidential adviser, Vidiye Tshimanga, <a href="https://observer.ug/news/headlines/62288-cargo-plane-crashes-in-congo-killing-presidential-staff-onboard">told reporters</a>.</p>
