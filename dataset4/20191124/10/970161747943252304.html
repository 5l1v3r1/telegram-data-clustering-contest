      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> just won <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! by impersonating Gillian McKeith’s unforgettable fainting spell in hilarious scenes.</p>
      <p>In last night’s episode, the Girls Aloud star was faced with holding live cockroaches in her mouth as part of a savage Bushtucker Trial and as she stepped up to the challenge she imitated the iconic moment from the 2010 series.</p>
      <p>‘Oh my God,’ Nadine said as she heard what gruesome task she was about to take on.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘What did Gillian McKeith do? She just went like this?’</p>
      <p>The singer then pretended to drop to the floor, causing presenters And McPartlin and Declan Donnelly and her campmates to erupt with laughter.</p>

      <p>Gillian struggled with life in the jungle and the trials during her stint on the ITV reality show and eventually passed out live on-air after the public had voted her to take on yet another challenge.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Nine years after going on the programme, Gillian still hasn’t ‘fully recovered’ from the experience.</p>
      <p>‘When I look back at the jungle, it’s like the stuff of nightmares. It was like being in a horror movie, to be honest,’ she told<a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/im-celebs-gillian-mckeith-says-20900227"> Daily Star Online</a>.</p>
      <p>‘I honestly think I’m suffering from PTSD.’</p>
