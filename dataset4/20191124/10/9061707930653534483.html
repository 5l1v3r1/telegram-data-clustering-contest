      <h1>Do you remember these classic beer ads? The beers were pretty bad, though</h1>
      <h2>Our Beerhunter is surprised to find you can still buy Skol lager, once advertised by Hagar the Horrible</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:03:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>I arrived at a small gathering of friends at the weekend, my pub quiz team lot, to find them gleefully awaiting my reaction to some beer they had picked up for the occasion.</p>
      <p>As you can see from the picture, they had brought along cans of Skol lager! Who knew that this stuff still existed? Well it does and, if you are particularly lacking in taste, you can pick it up from Iceland or bargain shops such as B&amp;M.</p>
      <p>It comes in at 2.8% and is made (I think “brewed” might be pushing it) by Carlsberg these days. It set me thinking about poor beers of the past, some of which we are glad to be rid of and some, like Skol, that are still hanging around, however implausibly.</p>
      <p>They were often propped up by some cracking advertising. I’ve always held the loose theory that the more money is spent on advertising a beer, the more that beer needs it to hide how bland it is, Guinness being the prime example.</p>

        <figcaption>Eric Cantona has more recently advertised Kronenbourg but do you remember when Schubert did?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Anyway, Skol. The name implies a Norse heritage but the only connection is that the brewing plant to make it was imported from Sweden to Alloa in Scotland, where Ind Coope had a brewery. It was introduced in 1959, which makes it as old as me.</p>
      <p>The brand has been through several owners and is big in Brazil, bizarrely, where Skol Beats is a variation that comes in blue, red and green at a whopping 7.9%.</p>
      <p>Older readers may remember an advertising campaign in this country using the Hagar the Horrible comic character to add to that false Norse theme.</p>
      <p>Around the same time came one of my all-time favourite ads, for Kronenbourg, a brand that does have a continental pedigree, even if what some people drink here is brewed by Heineken in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Kronenbourg recently ran into trouble, although it got out of it, with ads featuring former footballer Eric Cantona which hinted that the beer came from France. They weren’t the first and will not be the last to mislead consumers in this way.</p>
      <p>The ad I remember was much better and, I only discovered this week, featured the late British actor Alan Lake. He played the composer Franz Schubert and, in outrageous continental accents you probably couldn’t get away with today, the 30-second masterpiece went like this.</p>
      <p>Schubert is plonking away on his piano when his mates appear in the street below.</p>
      <p>“Hey Schubert, are you komming down zer bier keller?”</p>
      <p>“I hafn’t finished mein symphony!”</p>
      <p>“Kom on! A litre of Kronenbourg will loosen your chords!”</p>
      <p>“Now you’fe struck zer right note!”</p>
      <p>Cut to the pub, Schubert and mates sitting around supping.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Schubert, vot about your unfinished symphony?”</p>
      <p>“Vot about mein unfinished Kronenbourg?” Guffaws all round.</p>
      <p>You can find it on You Tube, where you can also find a series of adverts for Hofmeister lager, featuring a ridiculous Cockney wide boy character called George the Bear. Remember being told to “follow the bear?” The bear was good at darts and pool, wowed the laydees and impressed all the lads around him. Hofmeister, of course, was not German but a product of Scottish Courage, although, oddly, its modern incarnation is brewed in Bavaria and is an entirely different beer.</p>
      <p>To me, ad-land’s delight in Cockneys is one of life’s mysteries but some things don’t change. Today, we have Harry Redknapp as, to all intents and purposes, a real-life version of George the Bear. Compare the ads, they’re basically coming out with the same laddish nonsense.</p>
      <p>Whenever anyone says “you do realise....” I have to stop myself from saying “we WILL miss the match.”</p>
      <p>That was from an ad for Younger’s Tartan, the sort of terrible keg beer which allowed the Campaign for Real Ale to get a foothold. Here was a bus-load of football fans turning their noses up at a series of pubs until they stop at one with Tartan for sale.</p>

        <figcaption>Skol lager can still be bought... though why anyone would want to is a mystery.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“You do realise,” says the bus driver, “we WILL miss the match.” “Younger’s Tartan,” says the slogan, “Worth passing a few pubs for.” Or not.</p>
      <p>Whitbread Tankard and Watney’s Red Barrel were another two from that era and Steve Birkin, at the Rowditch pub in the city, keeps a Red Barrel dispenser unused on his bar as a reminder of how far we’ve come and, in Camra terms, what we were fighting against.</p>
      <p>That said, how many people of my vintage had a first tentative taste of beer from a Watney’s Party Seven can? Three of us, certainly, at my gathering on Saturday night, had a dribble or two from our dads’ Party Sevens. We did well not to be put off beer for life.</p>
      <p>But then, we never went as far as Skol... and neither did I last week. That can remained unopened, I assure you.</p>
