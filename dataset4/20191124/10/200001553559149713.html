      <p>Trabzonspor goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir has spoken to the Turkish press at an event held in Istanbul and discussed his links with Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The 23 year old has been in great form for Trabzonspor this season, which has led to reported interest from the Merseyside club in recent months.</p>
      <p>Asked about the reported interest from Liverpool, as <a href="https://www.star.com.tr/spor/">covered by Turkish newspaper Star</a>, Cakir said these links are giving him confidence: <i>“This situation gives me a lot of confidence but to be honest, I’m not paying too much attention to that. I believe this increased confidence can be seen in my game.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“To be linked with a move to Liverpool is a good thing but I am totally focused on Trabzonspor’s success this season.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Turkish international recently signed a new deal with his hometown club which will tie him to the Super Lig side until June 2024.</p>
      <p>However, this hasn’t stopped reports Liverpool are interested in signing the Turkey international next summer, with <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/liverpool-make-offer-youngster-official-sent-option-replace-summer-signing/">claims</a> earlier in the season the Premier League side could make an offer for him.</p>

      <p>There have been claims in Turkey Liverpool have been sending scouts to get a lowdown on the player, but they should expect to face competition to sign him.</p>
      <p>Cakir has made 18 appearances for Trabzonspor in all competitions this season.</p>
