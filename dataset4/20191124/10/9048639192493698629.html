      <p>Church leaders say the church also has other events in the community as well like bingo nights and bible study.</p>
      <p>Saturdayâ€™s meal gave them a little bit more, because there's no better way to give than with some "delicious food."</p>
      <p>"The church should be a vehicle that not only assembles on Sundays and Wednesdays, but actually has a hand out in the community, showing people by actions that we love you and who Jesus really is," says associate pastor D.J. Banks.</p>
      <p>Banks says the church has been feeding and providing Thanksgiving meals for about 10 years now.</p>
