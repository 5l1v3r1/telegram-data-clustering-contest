      <p>Who the heck legitimately calls 911 for pizza? Well, the answer is, no one does. A woman contacted a dispatcher in Oregon, Ohio not for delivery, but to subtly request officers to drop by. <b>Simon Ray Lopez</b>, 56, was charged November 14 on a domestic violence charge as well as a failure to appear, records show. He allegedly punched his 57-year-old girlfriend in the arm, according to <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/23/woman-calls-911-to-report-domestic-violence-allegation-under-the-guise-of-pizza-order/">Fox 6 Now</a>. The alleged victim’s daughter reportedly contacted 911 while the suspect was still there, but she didn’t tell the dispatcher there was an assault. She said she wanted a pizza.</p>
      <p>“You called 911 to order a pizza?” said 54-year-old dispatcher <b>Tim TenEyck</b>.</p>
      <p>“Uh, yeah,” the caller said.</p>
      <p>“This is the wrong number to call for a pizza,” TenEyck said.</p>
      <p>Uh, yeah, it was, but the caller doubled down.</p>
      <p>“No, no, no, no, no, no, no,” she said. “You’re not understanding.”</p>
      <p>Now he did.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting you now,” he said. TenEyck asked for the address. She gave it to him. “Is the other guy still there?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“Yep,” she said. “I need a large pizza.”</p>
      <p>He asked if they needed any medical attention.</p>
      <p>“No,” she said. “With pepperoni.”</p>
      <p>“All right,” TenEyck said. “We’ll get them going.”</p>
      <p>As heard on audio, he told officers to turn off their sirens because the caller ordered a pizza and agreed with everything he said about there being a domestic violence incident.</p>
      <p>Records viewed by Law&amp;Crime show that Lopez is represented by a public defender. Their office did not immediately return a request for comment. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for January 24.</p>
