      <h1>'Any team' - Steve Bruce addresses Jack Grealish's Aston Villa future before Newcastle United game</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest | Jack Grealish signed a five-year deal with Villa in September 2018, while Steve Bruce was still manager at Villa Park - but their sides will face off on Monday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:05:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce has labelled Jack Grealish as Aston Villa's "crown jewel" ahead of Monday night's clash with Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Grealish was one of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa's</a> key performers as they reached the Championship play-off final under Bruce in 2017-18.</p>
      <p>They were beaten by Fulham in that showpiece, before <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> helped lead Dean Smith's men to promotion 12 months on.</p>
      <p>The current Villa captain signed a new five-year deal at the club in September 2018, when Bruce was still in charge, and he has since been linked with a host of Premier League rivals, including Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.</p>

      <p>The midfielder has scored twice and registered three assists so far this League season.</p>
      <p>When asked if Grealish may need to leave Villa Park to make the most of his eye-catching quality, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/steve-bruce-reveals-secret-behind-jack-grealishs-development/">Bruce told the Telegraph:</a> "Do you want me killed? I have to say fair play to the owners, even though they sacked me, the first thing they did was to give Jack Grealish a new five-year contract and say we want to build the team around him.</p>
      <p>"How refreshing to every Villa supporter that was.</p>
      <p>"He is the crown jewel and he never wanted to leave.</p>
      <p>"It would be difficult for anyone to buy him with the size of contract he has got.</p>
      <p>"He could play any team - Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal - I rate him that highly."</p>
      <p>Grealish <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-jack-grealish-17295212">could make his return from injury</a> against Bruce's Newcastle at Villa Park tomorrow (Monday).</p>
