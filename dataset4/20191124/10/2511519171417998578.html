      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/elizabeth-banks?CMP=ILC-refresh">Elizabeth Banks</a> shocked her fellow guests on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/ricky-gervais-elizabeth-banks-golden-globes-graham-norton-show-charlies-angels-after-life-a9214631.html"><i>The Graham Norton Show</i></a> with a joke about <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/prince-andrew">Prince Andrew</a>.</p>
      <p>The<i> Charlie’s Angels</i> writer-director appeared on the show alongside Ricky Gervais, Kylie Minogue and Lewis Hamilton.</p>
      <p>When Norton attempted to embarrass Banks with a throwback photo from her teenage years, in which she sports hoop earrings and a big haircut, Banks laughed, “That’s my hair,” to which Gervais quipped, “Sorry, is that a tree behind you?” </p>
      <p>Pointing at the mysterious hand resting on Banks’s shoulder in the picture, Norton said: “I’ve only just noticed this hand, is it someone saying, ‘You’ll regret this photograph.’”</p>
      <p>“That’s Prince Andrew’s hand,” replied Banks, much to the delight of Minogue and Gervais who burst into hysterical laughter. </p>
      <p>“Photoshop, it’s just Photoshop,” said Norton. “Moving on.” </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has made headlines in recent days after a disastrous <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-andrew-interview-jeffrey-epstein-friendship-timeline-when-a9205946.html">TV interview</a> about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, in which he said he was incapable of sweating and denied having sex with then-17-year-old Virginia Roberts-Giuffre.</p>
