      <h1>Fantastic Four Director Josh Trank Reviews His Film: 'I'm Not Zack Snyder'</h1>

      <p>Josh Trank recently reviewed 2015's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/fantastic-four-movie/"><i>Fantastic Four</i></a>, tearing apart his own controversial comic book outing. While Tim Story had mixed success with 2005's <i>Fantastic Four</i> and 2007's <i>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</i>, Trank's film became almost universally hated among comic book fans and critics alike.</p>
      <p>Starring Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell, <i>Fantastic Four</i> had a famously troubled production. In the past, Trank has called out 20th Century Fox for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/trank-distances-himself-from-fantastic-four-insists-his-version-was-fantastic/">not letting him make 'his' movie</a>, and it seems that time hasn't changed his opinion when it comes to his thoughts on <i>Fantastic Four</i>.</p>

      <p>Giving it two stars on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/">Letterboxd</a>, Trank wrote, "The movie is ALRIGHT. I was expecting it to be much worse than it was. I literally haven’t seen it since like two weeks before it came out, and I was in a heavily fucking traumatized state of mind. Why? Eh, save that for another time."</p>
      <p>He goes on to praise the movie's cast but said he isn't sure whether he made the movie they deserved to headline. He then referenced the mythical Trank Cut, nodding to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-spoilers/"><i>Justice League</i>'s equally convoluted production</a>. "Is there a #releasethetrankcut? Doesn’t matter. I’m not Zack Snyder," he added.</p>
      <p>20th Century Fox envisioned a <i>Fantastic Four</i> sequel, but with the movie bombing at the box office, the cast was released from their contracts. Despite Tim Miller's plans for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-2-fantastic-four-concept-art/">the Fantastic Four to appear in <i>Deadpool 2</i></a>, the characters have been left in limbo since 2015. However, with Disney's recent acquisition of 20th Century Fox and <i>Ant-Man</i>'s <a href="https://www.cbr.com/peyton-reed-fantastic-four-movie/">Peyton Reed saying he'd love to make a Fantastic Four<i> </i>movie</a>, Trank is more hopeful for the future. He concluded, "And I just hope Peyton Reed makes the next <i>Fantastic Four</i> and crushes it. And that I get a cameo."</p>
      <p>Only recently, Trank gave fans a glimpse of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-fantastic-four-movie-that-could-have-been-actually-sounds-fantastic/">what his original script contained</a> and confirmed there was supposed to be much more character development. Elsewhere, deleted scenes tease that the fan-favorite <a href="https://www.cbr.com/fantastic-four-b-roll-footage-shows-deleted-scenes-possible-fantasticar/">Fantasticar was part of the original vision</a>.</p>
