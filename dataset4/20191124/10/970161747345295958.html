      <p>Kylie Jenner’s full pout <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/16/girl-12-stuck-huge-lips-two-days-trying-kylie-jenner-lip-challenge-10749993/">inspired viral challenges</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/03/theres-been-an-increase-in-men-getting-lip-injections-7050811/">a spike in lip injections</a>. Kim Kardashian’s curves led to a wave of dangerous <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/19/man-had-breast-implants-put-in-his-backside-to-get-kim-kardashian-bum-10425256/">butt implant procedures</a>. There was even a time after the royal wedding when surgery hopefuls took photos of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2013/03/15/brits-going-under-the-knife-for-pippa-middletons-bum-as-americans-opt-for-kates-nose-3543280/">Kate Middleton’s button nose</a> to their rhinoplasty specialists.</p>
      <p>In 2013, when an enormous hot air balloon with 10 breasts debuted in the Australian capital of Canberra, the cultural effects were similar.</p>
      <p>Sure, people <i>probably </i>weren’t tearing down to the surgeon’s office to see whether a 10-bosom rack would be physically achievable. It went deeper than that.</p>
      <p>As the burner illuminated the rotund belly and swollen nipples of the 30-metre whale, a striking vision of fertility was seared into the minds of the people.</p>
      <p>Canberra, home to approximately 420,000 people and one Skywhale, is known for its annual tulip festival and roundabouts with a landmass equal to that of mainland Russia.</p>

      <p>It’s the capital known to elicit the following response from Brits: ‘You’re <i>sure</i> the capital isn’t Sydney and Melbourne? I have an uncle/cousin/mate in Melbourne.’</p>
      <p>After its first flight, the government-commissioned balloon made headlines around the world, helping put the oft-forgotten city on the map.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Skywhale completed international appearances to rival Queen Elizabeth’s 1953 Commonwealth tour.</p>
      <p>It’s also just been announced that Patricia Piccinini, the talented artist behind the hovering empress, has developed a follow-up balloon named Skywhalepapa.</p>
      <p>So, what will he look like? Let’s first take stock of Skywhale.</p>
      <p>Her breasts tumble timelessly as if they could be stalactites in a five-million-year-old cave or the macramé pots hanging in a millennial’s rented flat.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more striking is the way the corners of her mouth crease into a demure, almost Mona Lisa-esque smile, that makes us all think: Girl, mystery dream girl, what secrets do you keep?</p>
      <p>While some might expect Skywhalepapa to be kitted out with dangling dongs, Patricia has revealed in a sketch that he will be more vertical than Skywhale and will exude the ultimate big dad energy by proudly carrying his whale brood.</p>

      <p>The artist intends to highlight and encourage the role father’s play in raising children. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, just one in 20 fathers take primary parental leave.</p>
      <p>If it takes a gigantic hover-daddy to encourage equal parental participation, we’re for it.</p>

      <p>At the end of the day, Skywhalepapa is one lucky lad. He has the lovechildren of mighty Aphrodite and the huntress Artemis as his spouse.</p>
      <p>Skywhalepapa will grace the skies in March 2020. To learn more about the project, visit <a href="https://nga.gov.au/balnaves/default.cfm">The National Gallery of Australia</a>.</p>
