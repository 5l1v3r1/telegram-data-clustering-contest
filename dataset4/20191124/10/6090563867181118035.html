      <p>Villagers from Gobo area in Silobela were on Monday left dumbstruck after crocodiles killed a man who was fishing on the banks of Tshapewa Dam, midlandsnews has gathered.</p>
      <p>Julius Hoko, a male adult whose age at time of death could not be immediately verified, was reportedly devoured by marauding crocodiles on Monday afternoon while fishing. His body was retrieved by villagers from Tshapewa Dam before being taken to Silobela District Hospital.</p>
      <p>Although Provincial police spokesperson for Midlands, Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende could neither deny nor confirm the tragic incident saying she was out of office, a villager who spoke to midlandsnews confirmed the development in an interview.</p>
      <p>“This is surely bad news for the entire Gobo community”, the villager said.</p>
      <p>“It happened at around 4pm and as I am speaking, we are at the Hoko homestead for the funeral. It took a lot of bravery from the villagers to retrieve his body and burial dates are not yet clear as that could possibly be done after post-mortem”, said the villager.</p>
      <p>Fanuel Sibindi, MDC shadow MP for Silobela Constituency raised concern over the increase of the number of people and domestic animal killed by the crocodiles at Tshapewa Dam and said he would engage the Zimbabwe National Parks.</p>
      <p>“The crocodiles have become brazen, l will engage the Zimbabwe National Parks and seek assistance as soon as possible said Sibindi.</p>
