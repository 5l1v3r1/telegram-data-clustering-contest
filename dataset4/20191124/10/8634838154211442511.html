      <p>Moments after sharing pictures of the ceremony with the couple-to-be at Bahari Beach Hotel, comments flooded the anchor's <i>Instagram </i>post with many wondering when he would be taking a wife too.</p>
      <p>Ombija jokingly dismissed the calls for him to tie the know soon stating, "As the chairman of all <i>Ruracios</i>, I had to witness my brother taking the big step and in the process launch the Mombasa chapter.</p>
      <p>"Love always wins. <i>na msiniulize ile swali </i>(don't ask me that dreaded question)" he stated pre-empting the inevitable questions around when he would finally getting married.</p>
      <p>His colleagues led the charge asking him if there were nuptials coming up. <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/victoria-rubadiri">Victoria Rubadiri</a> proclaimed that she was eagerly waiting for an invite to his ceremony.</p>
      <p>Ombija on his part, stated, "N<i>itakuwa Chairman kwa yako pia</i> (I'll proudly be the chairman in your Ruracio committee) after you my friend. <i>Pia wewe toa jam, haujaona numbers za census </i>(You are holding up the wedding line, haven't you seen the recent census numbers?)"</p>
      <p>Many others questioned when he was was getting married to which he responded, "<i>Surely, mbona "hamskizi maagizo, maswali chungu nzima!" </i>(Insert Coast accent)<i> "Pilipili isiowasa inakiulia nini"</i> (Insert Luo accent)"</p>
      <p>(Why are you people following the instructions? You are asking the same question I mde clear I didn't want to answer. Why should other people's business bother you?") he posed.</p>
