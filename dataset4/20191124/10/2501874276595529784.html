      <p>The San Marcos Parent-Child workshop (SMPCW) is a non-profit 501(c)3, licensed, cooperative preschool and parent education class. The lecture/lab instructor is provided by the Continuing Education division of Santa Barbara Community College.</p>
      <p>San Marcos Parent Child Workshop opened on the San Marcos High School campus in 1959 and relocated to the Grace Gathering campus in 2016.</p>
      <p>It is operated by parents under the supervision of a Director and Assistant Director educated in Early Childhood Education and Parent Education. Parents enrolled in the co-operative morning program participate actively one morning a week in the preschool setting. Parents also attend a weekly evening parent education class at the school, where a variety of parenting issues are discussed and speakers from the community share their expertise.</p>
      <p>Children between the ages of 2.5 - 5 years are introduced to a quality preschool experience, using developmentally appropriate practices. The nurturing, loving environment makes an ideal first school experience for your child and brings out the best in you as a parent. We practice gentle separation for both parent and child and promote non-violent conflict resolution. We provide a natural classroom setting with a wholesome, organic snack.</p>
