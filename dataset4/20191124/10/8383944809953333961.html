      <h1>Tesla gets nearly 150,000 Cybertruck orders despite launch mishap</h1>

      <p>Tesla's new electric pickup truck has secured almost 150,000 orders, the company's chief executive Elon Musk boasted on Twitter, just two days after its big reveal went embarrassingly wrong.<br/><br/>The billionaire Tesla co-founder floundered on stage in California on Thursday when the vehicle's armored glass windows cracked in a demonstration intended to prove their indestructible design.<br/><br/>Shares in the company plunged 6.1% following the truck's bumpy launch and several lackluster reviews.<br/><br/>But on Saturday Musk tweeted that Tesla had already received 146,000 orders from prospective owners.<br/><br/>"146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor," he wrote.<br/><br/>The demand comes despite the product receiving "no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement."<br/><br/>The industrial-looking Cybertruck is covered in the same steel alloy Musk plans to use for his SpaceX Starship rocket and will be able to go from 0 to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in about three seconds, the Tesla chief executive claimed in his presentation. He said the entry-level model will have a starting price of $39,900 and a 400-kilometer (250-mile) range, while a deluxe option will be able to travel twice the distance and will sell for $69,900.<br/><br/>No date has been given for its release, but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest. Its space-age design is unlikely to challenge top-selling models by Ford and other conventional car companies, analysts warn.</p>
