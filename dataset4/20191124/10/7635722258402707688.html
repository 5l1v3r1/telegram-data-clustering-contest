        <b>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is promising to bring back the Brexit bill before Christmas if his Conservative Party is returned to power in the upcoming election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories are launching their election manifesto this afternoon.</p>
      <p>It includes promises to hold a vote on the agreement before Christmas and ensure the UK leaves the EU by the January deadline.</p>
      <p>It also pledges a “triple tax lock” which would mean no rises in income tax, national insurance or VAT.</p>
      <h3>Brexit</h3>
      <p>Mr Johnson has promised to hold a vote on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement before Christmas so people can “enjoy their festive season free from the seemingly unending Brexit box set drama.”</p>
      <p>He insisted a Conservative majority would see “Brexit done by the end of January.”</p>
      <p>If the UK Government ratifies the bill it would pave the way for negotiations on future trading to begin.</p>
      <p>"My early Christmas present to the nation will be to bring the Brexit bill back before the festive break, and get parliament working for the people,” said Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>"Uncertainty ended, investment unlocked; a nation moving forward once again."</p>
      <h3>Manifesto</h3>
      <p>The Tory manifesto also promises to reduce immigration and hire 20,000 more police officers.</p>
      <p>On the environment, it promises a ban on exporting plastic waste to non-OECD countries and the creation of an Office for Environmental Protection to implement carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
      <p>Labour, the Green Party and the Lib Dems all released their manifestos earlier this week.</p>
