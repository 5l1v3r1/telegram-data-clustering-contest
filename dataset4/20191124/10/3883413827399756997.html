      <p>Pope Francis has demanded world leaders scrap nuclear weapons, insisting the arms race decreases security, wastes resources and threatens humanity.</p>

      <p>The Pontiff blasted the demise of arms control treaties while visiting Nagasaki in Japan, where one of two atomic bombs were dropped during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>After laying a wreath and praying at the foot of the memorial to the victims, the Pope said the place stands as a stark reminder "of the pain and horror that we human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another".</p>
      <blockquote>"Convinced as I am that a world without nuclear weapons is possible and necessary, I ask political leaders not to forget that these weapons cannot protect us from current threats to national and international security," he said.</blockquote>
      <p>The first <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/tri-service/japanese-pm-offers-deep-repentance-over-wwii">US atomic bomb</a> fell on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, killing 140,000 people.</p>

      <p>The second one dropped three days later on Nagasaki and killed another 74,000 by the end of the same year.</p>
      <p>Many of the survivors have suffered the lasting impact of radiation and developed various forms of cancer.</p>
      <p>The Pontiff has long vocalised his views on nuclear weapons saying not only the use but the mere possession of them is "to be condemned".</p>

      <p>"The possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is not the answer to this desire; indeed they seem always to thwart it," he added.</p>
      <p>The Pope will visit Hiroshima on Sunday as he starts a three-trip to Japan aimed at calling for a global ban on atomic weapons.</p>
      <p>He further lamented the "climate of distrust" on non-proliferation efforts and the arms control framework, a reference to a series of violated treaties and the demise of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, a landmark Cold War-era arms control agreement.</p>
      <p>The US formally withdrew from the treaty in August, after accusing Moscow of developing a Russian missile system prohibited under the agreement.</p>
