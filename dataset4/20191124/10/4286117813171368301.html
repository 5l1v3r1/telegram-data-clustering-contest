      <p>Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has demanded that Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari should resign from his post on moral grounds.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Ashok Gehlot said, "The Governor was very much a part of the entire plot that unfolded in Maharashtra. He should resign from his post."</p>

      <p>"The mandate lies with Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP," said Gehlot, slamming the surprise swearing-in of Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister on Saturday with NCP's Ajit Pawar as his deputy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Congress has been demanding an immediate floor test in the Maharashtra assembly and Congress alleged that the BJP is "running away" from proving a majority in Assembly as it does not have the required numbers.</p>
      <p>Congress leader and former state chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in a joint plea by the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena said they have sought the Supreme Court's intervention to order a floor test immediately.</p>
      <p>Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the current government in the state is "illegitimate" and a floor test is the only solution.</p>
      <p>Saturday's move jolted the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena who were giving final touches to government formation in Maharashtra but rattled the NCP the most due to Ajit Pawar's rebellion.</p>
      <p>NCP president Sharad Pawar had snubbed Ajit Pawar for taking decisions unilaterally.</p>
      <p>The BJP and Ajit Pawar are running away from a floor test as the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena combine has the majority, Surjewala claimed.</p>
