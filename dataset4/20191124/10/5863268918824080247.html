      <h1>Indian occupation turns IoK into volcano waiting to erupt: Asad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:11:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>(Web Desk) – Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States Asad Majeed Khan has said that the decades of Indian occupation and repression of Jammu and Kashmir have turned the disputed territory into “a volcano waiting to erupt.”</p>
      <p>In an opinion piece in New York Daily News, the ambassador said since August 5th, Kashmir has been under military lockdown and the Kashmiri people have been subjected to collective punishment in the form of mass arrests of their leaders, activists and young people were under a complete communications blackout.</p>
      <p>He said having failed to normalise its occupation of Kashmir, India has been gambling another military escalation on the Line of Control (LoC), hoping that it would help the BJP externalise the consequences of its repression.</p>
