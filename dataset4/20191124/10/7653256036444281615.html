      <p>The government plans to amend the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Insolvency-and-Bankruptcy-Code">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code</a> (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/IBC">IBC</a>) to provide immunity to companies taking over stressed assets from prosecution for financial crimes committed by erstwhile promoters.</p>
      <p>This will help make the insolvency process more attractive for the bidders and instil confidence in them, sources said.</p>
      <p>The government may move an amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 during the current Winter Session of Parliament.</p>
      <p>The amendment comes after several companies that are vying for assets being auctioned under IBC expressed concern regarding getting into legal trouble over the cases against previous promoters.</p>
      <p>In many of the cases under insolvency, the promoters are under investigation by various agencies, the sources said.</p>
      <p>"We are working out a mechanism where the resolution applicant, who through this entire court supervised process is acquiring a stressed asset as a going concern, will not be encumbered by the criminal liability relating to the company which has been caused by the previous management," an official said.</p>
      <p>A clear direction on this will not allow occurrence of cases like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhushan-Power-and-Steel">Bhushan Power and Steel</a> Ltd (BPSL).</p>
      <p>Last month, the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Enforcement-Directorate">Enforcement Directorate</a> (ED) had attached BPSL's land, buildings, plant and machinery in Odisha worth more than Rs 4,000 crore in a case related to alleged diversion of bank funds, delaying the resolution process under which JSW Steel was set to take over the company.</p>
      <p>Following the development, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCLAT">NCLAT</a>) asked the ED and the corporate affairs ministry to reach a consensus on the issue of attachment of assets of BPSL.</p>
      <p>While the ED is of the opinion that it can attach the property of BPSL under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/PMLA">PMLA</a>), the ministry has been maintaining that the agency cannot do so as proceedings under the IBC are on.</p>
