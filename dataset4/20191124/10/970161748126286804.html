      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity whittled down its remaining six acts to its four finalists on Saturday night – meaning we had to bid farewell to two more acts.</p>
      <p>Following last weekend’s show, when Vinnie Jones pleaded with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> to send him home instead of Glee’s Kevin McHale, there was everything to play for ahead of next weekend’s grand final.</p>
      <p>So who fell at the final hurdle in the movie-themed show?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Who left X Factor: Celebrity last night in the semi-final?</h3>
      <p>Last night’s X Factor: Celebrity saw Vinnie Jones and rugby trio Try Star miss out on a place in next weekend’s final.</p>
      <p>Vinnie lost out after finishing bottom of the public vote – and said his time on the show was  ‘absolutely fantastic.’</p>

      <p>‘Simon, thank you for inviting me to be part of this,’ the former footballer added: ‘You’ve really helped me with my personal life bringing me on to this show and i was always be forever indebted to you, thank you very much.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Try Star found themselves in the sing-off alongside girl band V5 – but ultimately it was the latter who made it through to next weekend, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/x-factor-celebrity-fans-baffled-nicole-sherzinger-voted-off-try-star-amid-romance-rumours-thom-evans-11207920/">Nicole Scherzinger sprung a surprise by choosing to send Try Star home</a> – raising a few eyebrows given that she has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/x-factor-celebritys-simon-cowell-louis-walsh-put-nicole-scherzinger-spot-confirm-romance-try-stars-thom-evans-11207751/">romantically linked to band member Thom Evans this week.</a></p>
      <p>‘This is so hard, boys I was really impressed with you tonight,’ she said.</p>

      <p>‘I felt like I saw the competitive side come out in you all and I have so much respect for you after that performance. And girls, you know I’ve loved you from day one. The act that I’m sending home is Try Star,’ Nicole concluded.</p>
      <p>Simon, clearly taken aback by her decision, went on: ‘Wow, that was a surprise.</p>
      <p>‘As I said earlier on it’s a popularity competition and it’s a talent competition. Boys what you’ve done in the weeks you’ve had available is unbelievable. Girls, in seven days you’ve been put together which is remarkable. If I’m judging it purely on what I call the real world, I have to send home Try Star.’</p>

      <p>With both judges having voted off Try Star there was no need for Louis Walsh to vote, as they were eliminated from the competition, with Ben Foden telling Dermot O’Leary they had ‘loved every second’.</p>

      <p>‘We said to each other as long as we come out and give 110 per cent every time…we’ve loved every second of it, we can’t have any regrets,’ he revealed.</p>

        <figcaption>V5 made it through to the final after landing in the sing-off (Picture: Rex Shutterstock)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The following four acts have made it through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jenny Ryan (Overs)</li>
        <li>Max and Harvey (Groups)</li>
        <li>V5 (Groups)</li>
        <li>Megan McKenna (Unders)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The result means that each of the judges has an act in the final – with Nicole and Louis fielding one each and Groups mentor Simon Cowell with two.</p>
