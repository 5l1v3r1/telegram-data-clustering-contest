      <p>— Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was admitted to a hospital Friday for chills and a fever.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, was evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington before she was transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital where she will continue to be evaluated and undergo treatment, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_11-23-19">the court said in a release</a>. </p>
      <p>Her condition has improved through the use of antibiotics and intravenous fluids. She is expected to be released as soon as Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>This is not the first health scare for the justice. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_08-23-19">In August</a>, she was treated for pancreatic cancer. Last year, she underwent treatment to have <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_12-21-18">cancerous nodules removed</a>. Two months before that, she fractured <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_11-08-18">three ribs after falling in her office</a>. </p>
