        <b>India became the first team to win four consecutive Tests by an innings as they crushed Bangladesh in the second Test.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hosting their maiden day-night Test, the home side's first innings of 347-9 declared proved enough as they bowled Bangladesh out for 106 and 195-9.</p>
      <p>The tourists began day three on 152-6 and lost their final three wickets in 8.4 overs, with Mahmudullah not batting after retiring hurt on day two.</p>
      <p>India's victory by an innings and 46 runs sealed a 2-0 series win.</p>
      <p>It was also their seventh Test win in a row and consolidated their position at the top of the World Test Championship.</p>
      <p>Pace bowler Umesh Yadav took all three Bangladesh wickets on the third day, including dismissing Mushfiqur Rahim for 74.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/50532160">The match also saw India captain Virat Kohli</a> equal former Australia batsman Ricky Ponting's record of 41 international centuries with 136 in his side's sole innings.</p>
