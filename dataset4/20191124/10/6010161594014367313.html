      <h1>PS4 Black Friday offers include cheap PSVR, PS4 Pro, more</h1>

      <p>This year’s PS4 Black Friday deals include a generous helping of unusually affordable offers, including cheap PSVR, PS4 pros, and much more.</p>
      <p>Although Black Friday is a highly-anticipated event all over the world, it’s rare to see a massive company offer top-of-the-range poster stock for genuinely reasonable prices. Luckily, that’s exactly what Sony has decided to do this year.</p>
      <p>VR has quite a high entry price point, which makes it largely inaccessible to aspiring users. PSVR specifically is often seen as a cheap alternative to the likes of the Rift and the Vive, but this rings even more true given the Black Friday deals attached to it this year. In a post on the official <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/11/18/playstation-2019-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony announced one particular PSVR deal that should allow people on the fence to jump off and leg it home to don a fancy new headset.</p>
      <p>For $199.99 — as opposed to the usual $300 — you can get yourself a multi-game bundle featuring a PSVR headset, a PlayStation camera, and five games: the critically-acclaimed Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Everybody’s Golf, and PlayStation VR Worlds. Not a bad offer.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the only deal Sony’s offering though. Alongside savings on PSVR are deals on standard PS4s: $199.99 for a 1TB base PS4 with The Last Of Us, God Of War, and Horizon: Zero Dawn, or a PS4 Pro for $299.99, as opposed to the usual $399.99. Yearly subscriptions are also 25% off, and select titles will see massive price slashes, including Marvel’s Spider Man and Days Gone. These offers are for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and will run from November 24 until December 2 (or November 28 until December 6 in Canada).</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever wanted to try your hand at virtual reality, now’s probably the time. It isn’t often you’ll come across good deals on compatible headsets and controllers, but that’s what Black Friday is for, eh?</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, Death Stranding is also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/23/ps4-pro-black-friday-sale-death-stranding/">free with this PS4 Pro bundle</a>, and there are <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/23/epic-games-stores-black-friday-sale-great-offers-red-dead-redemption-2-borderlands-3/">great offers over at the Epic Games Store</a>.
