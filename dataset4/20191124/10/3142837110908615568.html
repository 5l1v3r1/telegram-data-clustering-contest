      <p><a href="https://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1">Zacks Investment Research</a> cut shares of Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a research report sent to investors on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.zacks.com//">Zacks.com</a> reports.

      <p>According to Zacks, “Pitney Bowes’s third-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line declined year over year. Nonetheless, revenues improved year over year on growth in Global Ecommerce and Presort Services. Strong performance of domestic parcel platform, increased volumes across Marketing Mail, First Class Mail, and Bound and Packet Mail, drove growth. Higher equipment sales and improvement in business services are positives.  Further, Pitney Bowes’ bottom-line guidance for 2019 holds promise. However, impact from market exits, lower revenues from supplies, support services and financing weighed on the top line. Furthermore, adverse changes in postal regulations across key markets and intensifying competition are likely to negatively impact profitability. Changing business mix is also likely to limit margin expansion.”</p>
