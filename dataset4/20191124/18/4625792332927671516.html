      <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from the hospital and is said to be doing well after <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-hospitalized-for-chills-and-fever">suffering chills and a fever</a></u>.</p>
      <p>A representative for the Supreme Court justice <u><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-released-hospital-spokeswoman/story?id=67270647&amp;cid=social_twitter_tw">announced</a></u> on Sunday morning that Ginsburg had returned home from the hospital and was “doing well.”</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, was hospitalized Friday night after becoming ill earlier in the day. She received treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where she was given “intravenous antibiotics and fluids,” which helped her symptoms subside. Doctors were confident that she would be released as early as Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>This was the second medical episode that Ginsburg has faced in recent months after she also <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-returns-to-supreme-court-after-brief-illness">missed one day </a></u>of oral arguments while recovering from the stomach flu in mid-November. The justice has additionally <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court-justice-ginsburg-has-treatment-for-cancerous-tumor">battled four bouts of cancer</a>, including two in the past year.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg vowed to remain on the court until the age of 90. She was appointed by President Clinton in 1993.</p>
