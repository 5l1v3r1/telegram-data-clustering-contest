      <p>Gary Neville branded Anthony Martial, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marcus-rashford/">Marcus Rashford</a> and Daniel James ‘an absolute joke’ before <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> mounted an incredible comeback in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Sheffield United.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/gary-neville-sends-warning-manchester-united-players-sheffield-united-clash-11210541/">The former right-back predicted a tough afternoon</a> for the Red Devils at Bramall Lane and his fears were confirmed as Chris Wilder’s men dominated possession in the opening periods.</p>
      <p>David de Gea managed to keep the Blades out with a terrific double save but the Spaniard could do nothing as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/gary-neville-slams-phil-jones-comical-defending-hands-sheffield-united-goal-11210869/">Phil Jones’ calamitous defending led to John Fleck’s opening goal</a> before Lys Mousset added a stunning second in the 52nd minute.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Mousset’s goal, Neville criticised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s defence and midfield before ripping into United’s front three for a laughable lack of movement.</p>

      <p>‘The lack of from movement from Martial, Rashford and James is a joke,’ Neville said on <i>Sky Sports’</i> commentary.</p>
      <p>‘It really is an absolute joke. All game. Nothing at all from them.</p>
      <p>‘Manchester United’s midfield is poor but you expect better from that front three.</p>
      <p>‘If you asked Chris Wilder to swap McGoldrick and Mousset for Martial and Rashford, he would say no.’</p>

      <p>In the space of seven breathless minutes, though, United clawed themselves back and took the lead as Brandon Williams, Mason Greenwood and Rashford all got on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>However, Ole McBurnie had the last word and spoiled United’s party with an equaliser in the 90th minute. VAR awarded the goal after a nervous wait for home supporters at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Reacting to United’s comeback, Neville said: ‘I called them [United’s front three] a joke 15 minutes ago, that front three. Their movement was awful, non-existent.</p>
      <p>‘They weren’t even good out of possession, they weren’t closing down Sheffield United but they have quality.</p>
      <p>‘These last ten minutes they’ve come to life.’</p>

      <p>In the first half, Neville slammed Jones for his comical defending which led to Fleck’s opener.</p>
      <p>‘If ever a goal had been coming… the warning signs were there. [Harry] Maguire and Jones, they can’t handle the running of Mousset and [David] McGoldrick in behind them,’ Neville said.</p>

      <p>‘It’s agricultural, it’s a channel ball, the easiest ball in the world for a centre-back to deal with and Phil Jones doesn’t deal with it.</p>
      <p>‘Sheffield United get their just rewards. There’s a little bit of good fortune at the end.</p>
      <p>‘Jones just has a look over his shoulder and in that moment he loses control of the duel and Sheffield United, look at them – four of them in the box! ‘Mousset gets his reward for following in.’</p>
      <p>Neville added: ‘Manchester United’s record when they go a goal behind away from home has been poor.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes watching Manchester United away from home, it’s almost like they’re shocked that the other team are up for it, and they’re at it and have energy.</p>
      <p>‘Look at them, getting to the ball. ‘Mousset had already given Maguire and Jones a tough time before that – third time lucky!</p>
      <p>‘But for a centre-back… a channel ball that you can see coming from 50 yards away is such a simple ball to be able to deal with. It really is.’</p>
