      <p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been released from a Baltimore hospital and is recovering at her Washington, D.C., home, a Supreme Court spokeswoman said Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, is “doing well” after being treated for a possible infection, said Kathy Arberg.</p>
      <p>The justice was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsberg-admitted-to-hospital-for-chills-and-fever/">taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> in Baltimore on Friday after experiencing chills and fever.</p>
      <p>She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and fluids during her two-day stay and the symptoms subsided.</p>
      <p>Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg has been battling health issues over the past few years.</p>
      <p>She underwent surgery for lung cancer last December and had radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas in August.</p>
