      <h1>Video: Hilarious Roughing The Passer Call In Raiders-Jets Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:56:51+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>There have been several questionable roughing the passer penalties this NFL season. Few, if any, are more laughable than the one that took place in this afternoon’s New York Jets-Oakland Raiders game.</p>
      <p>The Raiders were called for an embarrassing roughing the passer penalty on quarterback Sam Darnold midway through the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Oakland defensive lineman Maurice Hurst was called for a penalty for the hit on Darnold.</p>
      <p>We’re not sure what the referee was looking at here:</p>

      <p>ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler probably summed it up best:</p>
      <p>“One of worst roughing the passer calls I’ve seen in Raiders-Jets game. Not sure Maurice Hurst actually touched Sam Darnold,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t get much weaker than that penalty.</p>
      <p>The Jets are leading the Raiders, 10-3, midway through the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The game is on CBS.</p>
