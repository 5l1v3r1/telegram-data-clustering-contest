      <h3>Who has the best cheap car insurance in South Carolina?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/credit-scores-affect-auto-insurance-rates/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a> gathered premium pricing formulas from every car insurance company in each state. It found that three companies came out on top for three tiers of credit. Here are the average premiums the data shows for the typical single adult driver.</p>
      <p>Drivers with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-good-credit-score">good credit,</a> or FICO scores between 670 and 739, will find that their best options are USAA and State Farm, on average:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $907 per year</li>
        <li>State Farm car insurance: $1,228 per year</li>
        <li>GEICO car insurance: $1,367 per year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>People with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-excellent-credit-score">excellent FICO scores </a>above 800 can expect to see some of the lowest rates, on average:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $796 per year</li>
        <li>State Farm mutual car insurance: $1,020 per year</li>
        <li>Amica car insurance: $1,172 per year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drivers with poor FICO scores below 579 will pay the most for car insurance, on average. Here are the three most affordable companies for this credit range:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $2,071 per year</li>
        <li>GEICO car insurance: $2,219 per year</li>
        <li>State Farm car insurance: $2,237 per year</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who gets the best cheap car insurance in South Carolina?</h3>
      <p>As the numbers above show, the drivers with the best credit scores are likely to see the lowest costs of coverage. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-increase-your-credit-score-improve-credit">Raising your credit score</a> could be a big help in lowering your rate. But, with so many factors going into your costs for coverage and each insurance company weighing those factors differently, the best way to get a good deal is to shop around.</p>
      <p>To do this, you’ll want to get quotes from several different companies. Once you have several quotes, compare them, and don’t just focus on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premium</a> – the amount you pay for your policy. You’ll want to look for the policy that gives you the most coverage types and limits for your money. Also, look at the deductible, or the amount you’ll be responsible for paying if you get into an accident. The policy with the most coverage, the lowest deductible, and the most affordable premium is generally the best policy for you.</p>
