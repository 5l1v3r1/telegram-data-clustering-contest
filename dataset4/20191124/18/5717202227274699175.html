      <h1>Report: Roberto Martinez wanted Tottenham job</h1>
      <h2>Roberto Martinez fancied a return to the Premier League.</h2>

      <p>Belgium manager Roberto Martinez was keen to take the Tottenham Hotspur job, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/roberto-martinez-wanted-spurs-job-20946135">according to The Daily Star</a>.</p>
      <p>Martinez was ready to give up with the Belgian national team project to move back to England. Having previously managed in the Premier League with Wigan Athletic and Everton, Martinez wanted the Tottenham job.</p>
      <p>Spurs decided to part ways with Mauricio Pochettino during the week in a move which shocked a number of the fans. It didn’t take long before Jose Mourinho was named as his successor.</p>

      <p>In between Tottenham sacking Pochettino and hiring Mourinho, Martinez was interested. After more than three years with Belgium, he eyed a return to the English top-flight.</p>
      <p>Martinez has managed Swansea City, Wigan and Everton in the English league system. He won the League One title with Swansea and the FA Cup with Wigan – in the same year they were relegated. But his stint with Everton was less successful.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Tottenham probably have the right candidate in Mourinho. Martinez might have been an interesting experiment but his track record is not as impressive as Mourinho’s.</p>
      <p>Martinez might have won the FA Cup with minnows Wigan but he was also relegated. He was poor at Everton. And he could have done a better job with a talented Belgium team.</p>
