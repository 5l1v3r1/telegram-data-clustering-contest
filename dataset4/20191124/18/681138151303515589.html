      <p>Fears of traffic gridlock failed to materialise - even with the A14 closed for emergency roadworks - and town businesses as well as the visiting traders reported a spike in profits.</p>
      <p>Mark Cordell, CEO of Our Bury St Edmunds Business Improvement District, said the 14th edition of the famous Christmas market could well have been the "best year yet".</p>

      <p>He added: "The council made a real effort to make sure they kept us updated with when the car parks were full.</p>

      <p>"They also provided additional car parks and have worked with the local radio station to provide updates."</p>
      <p>Mr Cordell continued: "The town business holders are all saying they've had a great year too so people have gone in and spent in the shops as well as the stalls.</p>
      <p>"It seems to have benefited everyone."</p>

      <p>He is yet to analyse the figures but added: "I look at how much people have enjoyed themselves as a better marker of success."</p>
      <p>"It appears, in that regard, that we have had the best year yet in the sense its been the most beneficial and the least irritating.</p>
      <p>"Many local people have said how they managed to make it into town and do normal shopping and didn't struggle like in previous years."</p>

      <p>West Suffolk Council tweeted on Saturday afternoon that Highways England would be unexpectedly closing a stretch of the A14 between Bury St Edmunds and Newmarket at 8pm, just as festivities ended for the day but traffic continued to flow and there were no reports of major congestion.</p>
      <p>- An elderly woman was involved in a collision with car in the arc shopping centre car park on Saturday and had to be taken to hospital for further care.</p>
      <p>Her injuries were not thought to be serious.</p>
