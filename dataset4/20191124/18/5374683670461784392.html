      <p>Israeli spy Eli Cohen's widow, Nadia Cohen said that she turned to Mossad head Yossi Cohen to find out why the Mossad reportedly refused to pay a million dollars to locate her late husband's remains. "He's not worth the price they would have to pay?" Nadia asked. "They didn't want to check it out?</p>
      <p>"I want him [Yossi Cohen] to clarify what this is about," Nadia continued. "If it's true, I lost all my trust. I don't know if this man is lying or not."</p>
      <p>A report earlier on Sunday said that Khalid al-Hafidh, a Syrian living in New Zealand who claims to be the son of former Syrian president Amin al-Hafiz, said that the Mossad refused to pay him a million dollars to reveal the location of Israeli spy Eli Cohen's remains.</p>
      <p>"I am the son of the only person on this planet <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272164">who knows where the remains are buried</a>," he told <i>Newshub</i> in an interview according to a <i>Ynet</i> report.</p>
      <p>"I was cooperating with the New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service, in cooperation with the Mossad, in order to help find the remains of the Israeli spy Eli Cohen," he said.</p>
      <p>Al-Hafidh told <i>Newshub</i> that he is willing to share the information now without payment to grant the Cohen family long-awaited peace although past correspondence between him and the Mossad reveals that he was insistent on receiving the money.</p>
