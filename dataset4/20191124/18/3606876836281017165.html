        <b>Manchester United and Sheffield United shared the spoils after a dramatic 3-3 draw at Bramall Lane on Sunday, with the home side scoring a late equaliser after three goals from the visitors in seven minutes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team, outplayed for 70 minutes by the promoted side, trailed 2-0 after a first-half goal from John Fleck and a second-half effort from Lys Mousset.</p>
      <p>Chris Wilder's team were hungrier and more incisive but from nowhere United were back in the game, with 19-year-old Brandon Williams scoring in the 72nd minute.</p>
      <p>Manchester United suddenly looked full of ideas and incisive running, with the game turned on its head.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer threw on Mason Greenwood to replace Andreas Pereira, meaning they were now operating with an attacking quartet of Greenwood, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Daniel James.</p>
      <p>Just five minutes after Williams' strike, Greenwood equalised, finishing from close range after Rashford's cross.</p>
      <p>With the home side rocking badly, United poured forward again and Rashford swept home.</p>
      <p>But the drama was still not over, with Oliver McBurnie controlling the ball and firing past David de Gea to level at 3-3. The goal stood after a VAR check.</p>
