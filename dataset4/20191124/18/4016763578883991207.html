      <h1>Knowledge Drop: Kanye West Made A T-Pain Diss Track While They Worked On ‘808s &amp; Heartbreak’ Together</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:33:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Grant Rindner</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/T-pain">T-Pain</a> helped <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Kanye-west">Kanye West</a> on his massively influential fourth studio album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/808s-heartbreak"><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a>—which celebrates its 11th anniversary on November 24—but their relationship was sometimes fraught. As T-Pain explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zggbg53ebQ8">n a 2014 interview with DJ Vlad</a>, West even went so far as to make up a diss song about him while they were in the studio together.</p>

      <p>T-Pain is credited as a co-writer on the album cut <a href="https://genius.com/Kanye-west-robocop-lyrics">“RoboCop,”</a> but his overall impact on <i>808s</i> is far greater, as he revitalized the auto-tune sound that was a massive part of the record. During the creative process in the studio, Kanye was underwhelmed by some of Pain’s ideas and made a big spectacle of insulting him in the studio.</p>
      <p>“[Kanye] came up with this song for me, and it wasn’t a good song,” T-Pain recalled. “It was basically describing how wack my ideas was that I was coming up with. He made everybody in the studio join in to sing the song with him, ’T-Pain’s shit is weak.‘ It was actually pretty lyrical, I thought he should have put that on the record at some point.”</p>
      <p>In the <i>Genius Level</i> interview below, T-Pain explained his contributions to <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>, saying that West brought him in to emulate the sound of his debut, 2005’s <a href="https://genius.com/albums/T-pain/Rappa-ternt-sanga"><i>Rappa Ternt Sanga</i></a>, which brought auto-tune to mainstream hip-hop and R&amp;B.</p>

      <p>“We had writing sessions. I was in there helping with a lot of the 808s. He said he wanted that sound from my first album,” T-Pain said. “So I brought a lot of the stuff I used to make my first album, which was pretty much just fucking GarageBand. But hey, it’s a trade secret, I guess.”</p>
      <p>T-Pain and West worked together a few other times, including on the hit <a href="https://genius.com/Kanye-west-good-life-lyrics">“Good Life”</a> and the 2008 track <a href="https://genius.com/T-pain-therapy-lyrics">“Therapy.”</a></p>
