      <h1>Bolivia plans elections without Evo Morales in bid to end weeks of unrest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:49:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/our-foreign-staff/" target="_blank">Our Foreign Staff</a></address>
      <p>Bolivia's interim President Jeanine Anez signed off on new elections Sunday, in a key step towards ending weeks of unrest and turning the page on Latin American leftist icon Evo Morales. </p>
      <p>At least 32 people have been killed in violence that erupted after a disputed election on October 20, with blockades causing severe fuel and food shortages in La Paz and other cities. </p>
      <p>Congress on Saturday gave the green light for a new ballot without Mr Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president who had been seeking a fourth term after ruling the Andean country for nearly 14 years. </p>
      <p>Mr Morales claimed victory in last month's elections that opposition groups said had been rigged, triggering weeks of violent street protests.</p>
      <p>He fled to Mexico, where he was granted political asylum following his November 10 resignation after losing the support of the military. </p>
      <p>Right-wing Senate speaker Ms Anez, who declared herself interim leader after Mr Morales quit, signed the bill into law Sunday, vowing "clean, just and transparent" elections.</p>
      <p>"We are going to recover democracy with democracy," Ms Anez said at the government palace. </p>
      <p>Among other things, the law annuls the results of the October 20 vote and allows for new elections.  It also bars candidates who served in both of the two previous terms from seeking re-election for the same position. </p>
      <p>That prevents Mr Morales from contesting the presidency in the new ballot. </p>
      <p>The next step will be for Congress to agree on a new seven-member electoral court, after members of the previous panel were removed for allegedly manipulating results.</p>
