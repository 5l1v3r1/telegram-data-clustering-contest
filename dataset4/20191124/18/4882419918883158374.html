      <h2>The Barça B coach has praised Sergio Akieme's form and believes he is good enough for the first team</h2>

      <p>Barça B head coach, Xavi Garcia Pimienta, held a press conference following his side's most recent draw. "I believe we produced a very complete performance against one of the best sides in the division. It would be hard to find positives if we didn't play as well as we did. Even before they went down to 10 men, we were pushing for the winning goal. I'm very happy with the attitude and occasions we created."</p>
      <p>Asked about individual performances, Pimienta singled out Sergio Akieme. "He's an excellent signing we made. We wanted to strengthen that position and we've now got it under control. It's difficult to play in this team but he's adapted really quickly to our style of play. His performance was incredible. He's trained with the first team and Valverde told me he had a chance of making the squad for Leganes, although in the end Morer went instead. Whenever we sign a player it's to improve our side and so they can play for the first team. If Valverde needs him, he's ready."</p>
