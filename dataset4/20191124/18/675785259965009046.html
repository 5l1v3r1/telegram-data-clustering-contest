      <p>The teenage killers of Ana Kriegel have stopped talking despite being locked up together.</p>
      <p>And the murderers, identified only as Boy A and Boy B, blame each other about the crime which shocked Ireland.</p>
      <p>The teenagers do not interact and stay “as far away as possible from each other” despite being in close proximity at Oberstown Children’s Detention Campus in Co Dublin, reports the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/teen-killers-ana-kriegel-fallen-20946628">Irish Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Boy A, who was described by the judge as the “main actor”, was handed a life term and told he must serve at least 12 years before that is reviewed.</p>
      <p>He was also given eight years for aggravated sexual assault which will run concurrently.</p>

      <p>Boy B, who lured Ana, 14, to the farmhouse, was sentenced to 15 years detention, to be reviewed after eight years.</p>
      <p>He watched as she was choked and then sexually assaulted.</p>
      <p>A source told the Irish Sunday Mirror: “The two teenagers don’t talk despite being in close proximity at the campus, they avoid each other at all costs.</p>
      <p>“Boy A blames Boy B for revealing details of the crime to gardai while Boy B blames Boy A for getting him caught up in the murder to begin with.</p>

      <p>“They have to spend the next few years at the detention centre together and will most likely be in some of the same classes too.</p>
      <p>“When they turn 18 and are transferred to an adult prison they will most likely have to be segregated away from other inmates due to the nature of their crime too.</p>
      <p>“So regardless, the next few years of avoiding each other is going to be tough.”</p>
      <p>While housed at the centre, the boys will have access to computer games, movies, snooker and the gym.</p>

      <p>It’s also understood the two teenagers, when they turn 18 and are transferred to an adult jail, will have a specially-appointed prison liaison officer.</p>
      <p>The source added: “It’s most likely that they will end up going to Wheatfield Prison in Dublin.</p>
      <p>“Most teenagers who transfer over do so of their own accord and just have to get on with it and adjust as best they can.</p>
      <p>"There’s a massive difference between a juvenile detention centre and an adult jail.</p>
      <p>“A detention centre is like a holiday camp in comparison.</p>

      <p>“In the case of these two killers, there is talk that they will have their own appointed prison liaison officer to make the transition as easy as possible.</p>
      <p>“They will be accommodated as best as can be and will be well looked after.”</p>
      <p>The earliest possible release date for Boy A is in June 2031, while for Boy B it is June 2027.</p>
      <p>Ana’s body, naked except for a pair of socks, was discovered at a disused farmhouse in Lucan, Co Dublin, on May 17, 2018 – four days after her parents reported her missing.</p>
      <p>Her clothes were found nearby along with bloodied pieces of wood.</p>
      <p>There were signs of sexual assault and builder’s tape was found around her neck.</p>
