        <b>Oli McBurnie grabbed a deserved point for Sheffield United after Manchester United had staged an unfathomable comeback in a breathless 3-3 draw at Bramall Lane.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three goals in seven crazy second-half minutes saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead before substitute McBurnie capped off a superb game with a 90th-minute equaliser - which stood despite a nail-biting VAR check for the home fans.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>John Fleck and Lys Mousset gave the Blades a deserved 2-0 lead before Brandon Williams produced an excellent moment of finesse to pull a goal back out of nowhere inside the last 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Youngster Mason Greenwood then drew the sides level just five minutes later to set-up a grandstand finish, and Marcus Rashford completed the amazing comeback with goal of real quality just a further two minutes after, before McBurnie grabbed a fully deserved point.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side were woeful in the extreme throughout the first two-thirds of the game, and Chris Wilder's Blades should have been out of sight before the visitors produced a scarcely believable fightback that seemed inconceivable with the way they were playing.</p>

      <p>Sheffield United were first to everything, played with pace and purpose and looked for all money to be coasting to three points, but once the visitors got a goal out of nowhere, their front three finally showed what they are capable of by conjuring up a comeback that may have just saved their manager's job, despite McBurnie having the final say.</p>
      <h3>Blades looking sharper</h3>
      <p>It's was a feverish start from the hosts and they should have been in front after just ten minutes when De Gea was forced into making a fine double save when first John Lundstram curled in a low shot that the Spaniard palmed away.</p>
      <p>From the resulting cross, David McGoldrick had acres of space to plant his header goalwards, but his effort was too close to De Gea and at a nice height for him to fend it off one-handed from close range.</p>
      <p>The Blades took a deserved lead after Mousset bullied Jones off the ball and squared the ball for Lundstram, and when his effort was saved by the foot of De Gea the rebound hit Fleck's knee and bobbled into the corner.</p>

      <p>McGoldrick and Lunstram had further chances as somehow Manchester United got to the break just one goal behind, and Solskjaer wasted no time in dragging Jones off during the interval - although it had little immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Just seven minutes of the second half had gone when Fleck slid a beautiful ball through a gaping hole in the visiting defence for Mousset who gathered before driving a low shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>The one-way traffic continued until the game hit a quiet period, when out of nowhere Williams fired the Red Devils back into the game with a fantastic half-volley with his wrong foot at the back post with 18 minutes left to play.</p>
      <p>Greenwood then slid in to poke home Rashford's fine cross before Rashford himself finished off a brilliant move involving Martial and James to cap off the three-goal salvo in just seven minutes.</p>
      <p>To their immense credit, the Blades kept battling and McBurnie kept the last-minute goal he stabbed home despite a lengthy VAR check for a possible handball by him just before finishing.</p>
