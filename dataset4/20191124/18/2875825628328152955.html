      <h1>Sheffield United 3-3 Man Utd: 6 talking points as Oli McBurnie seals last-gasp draw</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United had scored three goals in seven minutes to take the lead but McBurnie scored late on to seal a deserved point for Sheffield United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:24:50+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Oli McBurnie snatched a last-gasp draw for Sheffield United after Manchester United had battled back from two goals down in a crazy game at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>The hosts took the lead when Lys Mousset outmuscled Phil Jones on the right flank and cut the ball back for John Lundstram. His shot was saved but John Fleck was on hand to bundle in and spark jubilation in the home end.</p>
      <p>The Blades doubled their lead in the second half when a lovely through-ball from Fleck found Mousset in the middle of United's half and he marched forward before sending a low drive into the bottom corner from 25 yards.</p>
      <p>But United fought back and goals from young duo Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood hauled Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side level in Yorkshire.</p>

      <p>And to cap off a crazy seven minutes, Marcus Rashford, who had endured a quiet afternoon, finished off a stunning team move to turn the game around at a shell-shocked Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>But in further drama, Oli McBurnie volleyed home in stoppage time to secure a point for the hosts, though VAR had a long look after the substitute appeared to handle the ball in the build up.</p>
      <p>However, after a lengthy delay, the goal stood and the Blades bounced back from the shock of conceding three goals to leave their home ground with a point.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here are six talking points from the game...</i>
      </p>
      <h3>United's youngsters spearhead the comeback</h3>

      <p>When United went two goals down, they really needed their experienced stars to turn up.</p>
      <p>But, in fact, it turned out that two youngsters were the ones who delivered the goods as Solskjaer's men mounted a surprise comeback against a stunned Blades side.</p>
      <p>Left-back Brandon Williams, 19, was an unexpected first United goalscorer to cut the deficit with a fine right-footed shot before Mason Greenwood, 18, turned home the equaliser.</p>
      <p>And then in a remarkable seven minutes, Rashford, 22, turned the game around for United by finishing off a well-worked move to give Solskjaer's side an unlikely 3-2 lead.</p>
      <h3>Mixed Bramall Lane return for Maguire</h3>

      <p>Harry Maguire captained Manchester United as the centre-back returned to former club Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The world's most expensive defender came through the Blades' youth system, making 160 appearances for the club before moving onto Hull, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and then Old Trafford over the summer.</p>
      <p>The boyhood Sheffield United fan joined the club at the age of 11 and it was no doubt an emotional day for him and his family, having enjoyed a remarkable rise to stardom.</p>
      <p>And he'll no doubt have mixed feelings about his afternoon. Conceding two poor goals will give Maguire nightmares on Sunday night but the Red Devils ultimately fought back and left Yorkshire with a point.</p>

      <p>There was a time when United were the dominant force of English football but it's been a steady decline since they romped to their last league title triumph in 2012-13.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Blades were in a very different situation back then too - they were plying their trade in League One and failed to secure promotion to the Championship that campaign.</p>
      <p>How things changed, eh? Chris Wilder has got the Blades playing some lovely football and they displayed that again on Sunday, producing a scintillating attacking display.</p>
      <p>United just couldn't handle the relentless pace of their attacks and had David De Gea to thank for keeping the score down to 1-0 at half-time.</p>
      <p>And, after the Blades looked like they would suffer an undeserved lead, they popped up with a goal that earned them a hard-fought point.</p>
      <h3>Disastrous day for Jones</h3>

      <p>Scott McTominay's injury saw Phil Jones come in for his first Premier League start of the season for Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Before the game, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer explained: “Phil has been training well. He’s got experience of playing both central midfield and at the back.</p>
      <p>“When you show the attitude he’s shown in training, it’s time for him to get a chance."</p>
      <p>But he didn't take it, failing to clear the ball in the build up to Sheffield's opener, and the former Blackburn man seemed out of his depth at the back.</p>
      <p>And to compound Jones' misery, he was hauled off at half-time and replaced by Jesse Lingard as Solskjaer opted for a chance of tactics.</p>
      <h3>Magical Mousset shines for the Blades</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Mousset endured a miserable maiden spell in the Premier League, failing to deliver the goods for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> during his three-year spell on the south coast.</p>
      <p>He opted for a move to the newly-promoted Blades in the summer and has found his feet, producing a string of fine performances that proves he has the ability to shine at the highest level.</p>
      <p>After playing a crucial role in the opener, Mousset then got on the scoresheet in the second half with a fine strike, firing home into the bottom corner to leave De Gea with no chance.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Frenchman now has more goals in 10 Premier League appearances for United (4) than he managed in 58 games for Bournemouth (3).</p>
      <h3>Henderson's absence hands Moore Premier League debut</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Dean Henderson, on loan from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , was ineligible for this game, forcing Wilder into a change to his starting XI.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils loanee was replaced in the Blades goal by Simon Moore, who not only made his top-flight debut but a first league appearance since May 2018.</p>
      <p>He'd have no doubt expected an onslaught but, in fact, Moore couldn't have had an easier first 45 minutes of Premier League action, with United failing to test the Blades stopper.</p>
      <p>Indeed, United had just one shot in the first half against Moore, the fewest they've had in the first half of a Premier League game under Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>But the second half was a different story and Moore went on to concede three goals - though, in truth, he couldn't have done much about any of them.</p>
