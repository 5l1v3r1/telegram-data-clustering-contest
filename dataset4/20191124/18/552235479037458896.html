      <h1>Tommy Wright in Lewis Ferguson Aberdeen swipe as takes defiant red card stance</h1>
      <h2>It was a heated finish in Perth as the home side salvaged a point despite finishing the match with nine men.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:08:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>St Johnstone boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tommy-wright">Tommy Wright</a> has hit out at Lewis Ferguson after his side's 1-1 draw with Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>It was a heated finish in Perth as Murray Davidson and Callum Hendry were sent off in the space of four minutes after Matty Kennedy cancelled out <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sam-cosgrove">Sam Cosgrove</a> 's opener.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman conceded both reds were the right decision by ref Kevin Clancy, but claimed Davidson was 'unlucky' with his tackle on Craig Bryson.</p>
      <p>Wright was critical of Ferguson for his persistent fouling and Clancy for not punishing the Dons star.</p>

      <p>He told Sky Sports: "It's frustrating and I've seen them back Murray is unlucky. The boy nicks it just before them and it looks worse than the actual challenge was.</p>
      <p>"There is no defence for Callum with that one. But if you look at the clips up to it, Logan fouls Kennedy and if the referee gives the foul there, the situation doesn't happen.</p>
      <p>"So they are the right decisions with he red cards but there are a lot of decisions we are not happy with as well.</p>
      <p>"Lewis Ferguson seems to be not allowed to get booked. Six, seven, eight fouls and doesn't get booked.</p>
      <p>"The two red cards are the right decision and it's a great point for us."</p>

      <p>Wright praised the spirit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> showed to get back in the game and hold on for the draw as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> pressed for a winner in the last 15 minutes with their two-man advantage.</p>
      <p>He added: "There was a lot of spirit, we battled right until the end. Because we did that, I thought we got what we deserved.</p>
      <p>"There wasn't much between the two sides, I'm disappointed in how we defended their goal but up until the last 15 minutes, I don't think Zander Clarke had any real save to make.</p>
      <p>"We had good control in terms of possession, but our decision making in the last third wasn't good enough.</p>
      <p>"We didn't create enough opportunities but at 1-0 I thought we were always in the game. Going two up top made a wee bit of a difference to us and going down to nine men, you have to give the players credit for sticking at it."</p>
