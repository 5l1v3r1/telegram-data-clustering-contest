      <h1>Aldi Kevin the Carrot: How to get your cuddly toy in time for Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Kevin the Carrot, which is available at Aldi, is selling out quickly at the moment, leaving thousands of shoppers disappointed after they queued for several hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:14:30+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>Aldi shoppers can purchase a furry toy called Kevin the Carrot at its supermarkets ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>But the cute mascots are selling out so quickly that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/aldi-kevin-carrot-fans-outraged-20949321">many shoppers have been left disappointed</a> already.</p>
      <p>Some woke up early to pre-order the toys but they were all gone after just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Aldi has, though, limited purchases to two per customer.</p>
      <p>Normal-sized toys are priced at £3.99. You can buy an absurdly giant one for £19.99, which stands at one metre tall, and one of Kevin’s arch-nemesis, the evil Pascal the Parsnip.</p>
      <p>But frustrated punters expressed their anger today.</p>

      <p>"They sold whilst I waited and within seconds of that happening they were being sold on eBay for stupid prices," one dad said.</p>
      <p>And an irate gran said: "I was in the queue With 33,000 in front of me.</p>
      <p>"There must be a better way of doing this. We don't stand a chance of getting the Aldi Kevin family now, disappointed grandchildren."</p>
      <p>Another lady wrote: "I was on the night shift at work. I tried to get on the Aldi site from midnight.  It took me three hours to get to the page where I could see I was in a queue, by 4 am everything was sold out.  These toys are for sale on eBay already."</p>

      <p>Shoppers can also snap up Kevin's wife Katie and three children.</p>
      <p>The mascot debut in Aldi Christmas TV adverts in 2016 and this year's inspiration came from Peaky Blinders.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Aldi told Mirror Online: “We’re sorry that some shoppers were unable to get their hands on these toys online this morning, however, demand has been extremely high.</p>
      <p>"As with all of our Specialbuy products, these will also only be available while stocks last."</p>
