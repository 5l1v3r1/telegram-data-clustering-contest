      <p>The <i>Star Wars </i>movies have always had a set trio of protagonists to follow. In the prequels it was Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padmé. In the original trilogy it was Luke, Han and Leia. And now, in the sequel trilogy, it's Rey, Finn and Poe. However, this time, the three characters have never shared a scene together all at once --until <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>Star Wars: </i></a><i>Rise of Skywalker </i>that is.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/star-wars-rise-skywalker-rey-finn-poe-dameron-exclusive-image/">Empire</a> released a new image from Episode IX, showing Finn, Rey and Poe all united in a single shot. The image can be seen below.</p>

      <p>Finn and Poe can be seen readying their blasters for a fight while Rey whips out her lightsaber. Even C-3PO is in the shot, lurking behind the trio.</p>
      <p>Finn and Rey became fast friends in <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>, traversing the galaxy far, far away together. Poe and Finn also bonded in the opening scenes of the 2015 film, escaping the First Order together.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi </i>scattered the heroes around the galaxy, causing them to be separate for a majority of the film. However, Poe and Rey finally met in the movie's last few seconds. The third installment in the sequel trilogy will finally see the three united, taking a stand against Kylo Ren and the First Order.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker </i>stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives on Dec. 20.</p>
