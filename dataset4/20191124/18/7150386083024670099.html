      <p>Television actor <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/mahhi-vij"><b>Mahhi Vij</b></a> and  <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Jay-Bhanushali"><b>Jay Bhanushali</b></a> had welcomed their daughter to the world in August this year. Post-pregnancy weight is very normal for any girl to have but there are some trollers who do not stop body-shaming the actors. In the recent turn of events, the couple has appeared on Bigg Boss 13 Weekend ka Vaar where they were supporting Siddharth Shukla and Rashami Desai.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, she has shared her picture from the show and was heavily trolled for gaining weight and many body-shamed her. Some even went to call her names such as ‘moti’. One user wrote, “Sharam Kar Moti.”</p>
      <p>However, the Laagi Tujhse Lagan actor immediately shut the troll by giving an epic reply. She wrote, “Don’t ask me what kind of a mother I am. I wish I could ask your mother, what kind of a child you are. (sic)” She further wrote, “Was your mother thin after delivering u like IDIOT.”</p>
