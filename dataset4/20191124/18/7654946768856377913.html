      <h1>Most Brits think Prince Andrew should talk to FBI about Epstein: poll</h1>

      <p>Most Britons want Prince Andrew to talk to the FBI about late pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein — as an increasing number say they now believe the royal’s sex accuser, according to a new poll taken a week after Andrew’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/prince-andrew-kicked-out-of-buckingham-palace-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">disastrous TV interview.</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/3d50b5c2-0e37-11ea-93be-ccf3f2ed7d1d">YouGov poll for the Sunday Times of London</a> showed that 72 percent of those surveyed think Andrew should make himself <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/fbi-wants-to-interview-prince-andrew-for-info-on-epstein-report/">available to legal authorities in the US</a> to discuss Epstein.</p>
      <p>Damningly, 45 percent now believe that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/virginia-roberts-giuffre-says-prince-andrew-should-go-to-jail-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s claims</a> that she was forced to have sex with the prince at age 17 are “probably true” — up from 27 percent when the same question was asked in January.</p>
      <p>Andrew emphatically denied the accusation in a debacle sit-down with the BBC last weekend, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-claims-he-doesnt-recall-meeting-alleged-teen-sex-slave/">insisting that he does not recall ever even meeting her</a>.</p>
      <p>Just 8 percent of those surveyed in the most recent poll thought that Andrew was telling the truth during his “car crash” interview, closely matching an earlier poll that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/just-6-of-the-public-believes-prince-andrew-poll/">put the figure at 6 percent</a>. More than half in the new poll — 54 percent — did not believe him, with the rest undecided, The Times said. In the previous poll, 51 percent said they doubted Andrew’s tales.</p>
      <p>Most of those surveyed — 58 percent — believe the backlash from Andrew’s ties to Epstein has damaged the royal family, according to the survey of 1,677 adults taken last Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>Less than a third — 30 percent — said the revelations had not damaged the monarchy, The Times said.</p>
      <p>More than half — 51 percent — now believe the Duke of York should be banned from all royal events, including ceremonial events involving the full royal family, such as the Queen’s official birthday and honoring the war dead on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, less than a third — 30 percent — said Andrew should be stripped of his royal title, according to the poll.</p>
      <p>“If Andrew is no longer representing or supporting the monarch in any capacity, or doing good charitably, what’s the point of him?”</p>
