      <p>HONG KONG — The Latest on the local elections that took place amid ongoing protest movement in Hong Kong (all times local):</p>
      <p>2 p.m.</p>
      <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi says Hong Kong is a part of China no matter what happens in the semiautonomous territory.</p>
      <p>Wang spoke Monday to reporters in Tokyo. He made the remarks in response to a question about Hong Kong’s district council elections in which the pro-democracy opposition appears to have swept to a resounding victory.</p>
      <p>Wang said: “No matter what kind of things happen in Hong Kong, Hong Kong is a part of Chinese territory.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Any attempts to destroy Hong Kong or harm Hong Kong’s stability and development cannot possibly succeed.”</p>
      <p>Six months of protests have rocked the former British colony.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>7:45 a.m.</p>
      <p>The pro-democracy opposition appears to have swept to victory in Hong Kong elections, as a record turnout dealt a clear rebuke to city leader Carrie Lam and her handling of violent protests that have divided the Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Votes were still being counted Monday morning, but Hong Kong media tallied that the pro-democracy camp had easily won a majority in the vote for 452 district council seats.</p>
      <p>The result will likely force the central government in Beijing to rethink how to handle the unrest, which is now in its sixth month.</p>
      <p>The district councils have little power, but the vote became a referendum on the protests. The record 71 per cent turnout for a Hong Kong election was slowing down the vote counting.</p>
