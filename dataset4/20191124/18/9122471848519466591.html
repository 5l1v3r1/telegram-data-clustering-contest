      <h1>Joel Klatt Releases His New Top 10 After Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:33:39+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Week 13 of the regular season is in the books and we had some fireworks yesterday. Oregon got knocked off, Oklahoma almost did and Ohio State survived its first big test of the season.</p>
      <p>Each week, Fox Sports’ Joel Klatt releases his personal top 10. Heading into the final week of the regular season, here’s what he has.</p>
      <p>Klatt’s top three of Ohio State, Clemson and LSU remains unchanged. Utah moves into the No. 4 spot thanks to Oregon’s loss at Arizona State.</p>
      <p>Klatt has been consistent about keeping Alabama and Georgia out of his top four, <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/joel-klatt-releases-his-new-top-10-after-week-12">much to the chagrin</a> of SEC fans.</p>
      <p>Here’s the rest of Klatt’s top 10:</p>

      <p>Michigan-Ohio State, Alabama-Auburn, Oklahoma-Oklahoma State and Wisconsin-Minnesota are some of the biggest matchups on the docket for Week 14.</p>
      <p>By Tuesday night, we’ll have the new College Football Playoff rankings. The top four teams will remain the same, though some have wondered if Ohio State will jump LSU for the No. 1 ranking after beating Penn State.</p>
