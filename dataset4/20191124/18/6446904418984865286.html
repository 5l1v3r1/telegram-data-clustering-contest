      <p>A SECTION OF motorway has collapsed near the Italian city of Savona following a mudslide triggered by heavy rain in the region.</p>
      <p>The viaduct serving the A6 motorway between Turin and France was washed away on Sunday, leaving a 30-metre gap in the road.</p>
      <p>Although emergency services did not immediately find any victims at the site, sniffer dogs and helicopters were checking the area to make sure.</p>
      <p>Images of the damage brought back memories of the 2018 collapse of the Morandi bridge at Genoa, only 50km away, which claimed 43 lives.</p>
      <p>In the Piedmont region, a 52-year-old woman was missing after her car was swept away when a river burst its banks.</p>
      <p>Local media reported that two other people in the car managed to get out of the car in time.</p>
      <p>The worst hit region in Italy was Alessandria, south of Turin, where 200 people were evacuated and 600 left isolated. One woman was reported missing, Italian media said.</p>
      <p>Another 500 people were evacuated further north in the Aosta Valley, where roads were closed because of the risk of avalanches.</p>
      <p>Venice was once again hit by the floods that have paralysed the city this month, even if the levels were well off the historic peak reached on 12 November.</p>
      <p>The waters that flooded the iconic St Mark’s Square in the city centre were at knee-height, and were beginning to recede by the afternoon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deaths in France</b>
      </p>
      <p>In France, two people were killed and at least one more is missing after historic rain levels drenched the south of the country, causing major floods that are only starting to recede.</p>
      <p>The high floodwaters buried cars underwater, turned roads into rivers and even allowed kayakers the chance to paddle down a highway.</p>
      <p>One body was found in the village of Le Muy, just north of France’s Mediterranean coast, close to where a rescue dinghy had capsized on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Three members of the fire brigade and three civilians were on board, local authorities in the southern Var region said.</p>
      <p>One of the civilians had been reported missing.</p>
      <p>The second body, of a man in his 50s, was found in the village of Cabasse in a car, said the local authorities, without giving further details.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another man in his 70s was still missing in the village of Saint-Antonin-du-Var after going out during the night amid heavy rain. Searches are continuing.</p>
      <p>The Alpes-Maritimes and Var regions have been hit by torrential rainstorms that also caused huge waves in seaside areas since Friday.</p>
      <p>A 39-year-old woman was badly injured on Saturday and hospitalised after being swept away by a wave, the fire service said.</p>
      <p>The town of Roquebrune-sur-Argens in the Var region was particularly badly affected and only accessible by boat or helicopter, local authorities said.</p>
      <p>Some 4,500 households have been left without electricity throughout the Var and Alpes-Maritimes regions.</p>
      <p>A senior official for the Var region, Jean-Luc Videlaine, told AFP that the rains had been of “historic” intensity, adding that the damage will be “considerable”.</p>
      <p>He said that water levels were now going down but added that the situation was “far from returning to normal”.</p>
      <p>In some areas of the Var region, the equivalent of two or three months of rain fell in just 24 or 48 hours.</p>
