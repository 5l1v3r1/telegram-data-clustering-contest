      <h1>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith wary of Newcastle's pace and power as he outlines respect for Steve Bruce</h1>
      <h2>Bruce will lock horns with former club Aston Villa tomorrow and in Smith, he will face the man who replaced him at Villa Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has spoken of his respect for Newcastle boss Steve Bruce and has praised the job he has done at St James' Park so far.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> returns to Villa Park tomorrow for the first time since being sacked as Villa boss last season. Bruce took the Villans to a Championship play-off final in 2018. His replacement, Smith, went one better and guided the West Midlands giants to a Premier League return last season.</p>
      <p>After a spell with Sheffield Wednesday, Bruce replaced Rafa Benitez as Newcastle boss in the summer to make his own return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The two sides meet on Monday evening as they both look for the win that will pull them further clear of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Smith has been impressed with the job Bruce has done at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> and he is particularly wary of the Magpies' pace and power up front.</p>
      <p>"I have an awful lot of respect for what he has done in management but, more importantly, for how he is as a man," he told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50533622">BBC Sport.</a></p>
      <p>"There were a lot of questions about the club and where it was going but Steve has gone in and done what he does best - got them organised.</p>
      <p>"They've got pace and power up front. They are winning games - they've won the last couple - and they beat Manchester United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment."</p>
