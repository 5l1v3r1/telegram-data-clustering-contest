        <b>Well this has come from nowhere. Sheffield United completely dominated Manchester United for the first 70 minutes of the game but it’s been completely turned on it’s head.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brandon Williams got his side back into the game with a lovely finish, before Mason Greenwood leveled things up moments afterwards. It’s a great ball from Rashford and Greenwood shows some great instincts to guide the ball home:</p>

      <p>It took an even bigger turn minutes later when Rashford actually put Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men in front. Can they hold on for an important victory?</p>
