      <h3>Eco-tourism in focus at conference</h3>
      <p>The concept of eco-tourism and the ability for green credentials to benefit every sector is growing quickly. And it is about more than just carbon-taxing airfares. Its complexities and the rapid pace of its message will be discussed at the Inspiring Sustainable Tourism conference on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of catching fire in the same way that the whole concept of sustainability is,” explains <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ciara+Myburgh">Ciara Myburgh</a> of hosts Sustainable Travel Ireland (the soon to be rebranded identity of the former Eco Tourism Ireland).</p>
      <p>“Consumer interest is going up big time but consumer awareness on how to do it is still very low. Businesses realise that this is coming and it’s coming faster than expected. So it’s about how to market yourself to these customers.”</p>
      <p>The rate of tourism sustainability is based on a number of factors – environmental impact of course, but also visitor experience, business sustainability and community. Put more simply, as Myburgh does, it is the marriage of corporate and environmental responsibility, an ever more present philosophy.</p>
      <p>This year’s inaugural conference, expecting about 150 representatives from tour operators, public sector bodies and local authorities, is unlikely to be the last. Speakers include <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ryanair">Ryanair</a> chief marketing officer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kenny+Jacobs">Kenny Jacobs</a> and environmental scientist Dr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Cara+Augustenborg">Cara Augustenborg</a>.</p>
      <h3>Experts gather for white collar crime conference</h3>
      <p>White collar and corporate crime has entered a new era of enforcement with greater regulation, increasing awareness and the rise of the whistleblower. Ahead of its first conference on the subject, A&amp;L Goodbody notes that media scrutiny has never been sharper, nor corporate reputation more important.</p>
      <p>Business crime may be easy to discuss in broad terms but Wednesday’s event has the draw of four of Ireland’s top experts in the area – <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Derville+Rowland">Derville Rowland</a>, director general of financial conduct at the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Central+Bank">Central Bank</a> of Ireland; <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ian+Drennan">Ian Drennan</a>, director of corporate enforcement; <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pat+Clavin">Pat Clavin</a>, head of the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Criminal+Assets+Bureau">Criminal Assets Bureau</a> (Cab); and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pat+Lordan">Pat Lordan</a>, head of Garda national economic crime and cyber crime bureaus.</p>
      <p>Of particular focus will be the role of regulators in the area of individual responsibility, and personal sanctions. Experts will also address the risk of exposure for senior individuals and how this can be managed in practice, as well as the role of organisational culture.</p>
