      <h1>Princess Beatrice devastated after helping set up Prince Andrew’s interview</h1>

      <p>Prince Andrew’s daughter Beatrice is “in tears” over the fallout from her father’s disastrous TV interview — because she helped push for the sit-down, a new report says.</p>
      <p>Princess Beatrice — who is the Duke of York’s elder daughter with Sarah Ferguson — encouraged the BBC interview, in which her embattled father badly fumbled while addressing his relationship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, during discussions about whether he should do it, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718663/Princess-Beatrice-helped-set-father-Prince-Andrews-car-crash-BBC-interview.html">according to the Mail on Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>“Even though she’s their daughter, both Sarah and Andrew rely on Beatrice’s judgment a lot when it comes to dealing with the public, as she’s got an old head on young shoulders,” a source told the outlet.</p>
      <p>The royal daughter was initially skeptical about her dad sitting down for a televised chat, but she changed her mind after she joined him and his private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, for discussions with the broadcast team, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>“She was asking lots of pertinent questions and had her doubts,” the source said. “But by the end of the meeting, she was convinced by the Newsnight team and Amanda Thirsk that they had no choice – that it was the only way to put all the rumors behind them.”</p>
      <p>The princess is now devastated that she didn’t pull the brakes on the interview, which included outrageous denials by her dad and led to him <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-didnt-step-back-from-royal-duties-queen-elizabeth-fired-him/">reportedly being sacked</a> by his mom, Queen Elizabeth II, from Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>“Beatrice has been in tears every day since the interview went out,” a source told the outlet.</p>
      <p>Her father announced Thursday that he’d be stepping down from his royal duties. The duke has expressed that he hopes Beatrice and her sister Princess Eugenie will replace him as patrons of his various charitable organizations, a source <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrew-looks-to-eugenie-and-beatrice-to-take-over-his-royal-duties-t09d2kqsj?region=global">told The Sunday Times</a>.</p>
