      <p>Birmingham City resume their Sky Bet Championship campaign on Saturday as they were held to a 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p>The clash at the John Smith's Stadium was Blues' first match after the November international break.</p>

      <p>But what do the bookmakers think about their chances of going up or indeed down this term ahead of their return to action at Sheffield Wednesday in midweek?</p>
      <p>Below is a regularly updated list of all the Blues and Championship odds you need from promotion to top goalscorer.</p>
      <h3>Next game</h3>
