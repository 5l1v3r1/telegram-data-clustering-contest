      <p>Whoever wins the final round of the tortuous drama that is government formation in Maharashtra, one thing is clear: the Maha story is essentially about one man — <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharad-Pawar">Sharad Pawar</a>.</p>
      <p>One of his family members had once said, “He is like an ocean. Nobody knows what is going on inside him.” On Friday night, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief had publicly declared that the next Maharashtra CM was going to be Uddhav Thackeray. Before you could finish reading that headline on Saturday morning, Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the CM again, with Ajit Pawar as deputy CM.</p>
      <p><b>(Pa)War 2.0</b> <br/>Intense speculation started on whether Ajit Pawar had done an ‘SP’ (his uncle), the ‘SP’ reference being to the time when, in 1978, Pawar Sr had conducted a coup, replacing V B Patil as CM by taking a group out of Congress to form a government with the Janata Party. Or did Pawar do an SP on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> and Congress by joining hands with BJP?</p>
      <p>Or was it a case of Congress doing an SP on Pawar by delaying the formation of a non-BJP government, allowing the horse to bolt, possibly because the GOP did not really want to go with the Sena?</p>
      <p>From the events that followed, clearly Sharad Pawar did not nudge nephew Ajit to facilitate the formation of a BJP government. But it is difficult to believe that he did not have any inkling about it. At the Friday night meeting of Sena, NCP and Congress, Ajit Pawar had struck a particularly hard note against Congress — that no weighty portfolios, deputy chief ministership or speakership be given to the party. Sharad Pawar had reportedly walked out before the meeting was over, and announced to the waiting media about Thackeray becoming CM.</p>
      <p>It is inconceivable that somebody would not have alerted Sharad Pawar during the night about Amit Shah’s coup. Pawar is known for his links in the bureaucracy, police and intelligence agencies, even Raj Bhavan. But as Saturday wore on, it became clear that Ajit Pawar’s action did not have Pawar Sr’s backing. Daughter Supriya Sule’s emotional response early in the day, about a ‘split’ having taken place in the party and the family showed that Pawar felt betrayed.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar, however, fought back again, mobilising all the resources at his command to reportedly rally his flock back to his side, replacing Ajit Pawar with Jayant Patil as the leader of NCP’s legislature party. He struck back just as he had fought back after the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) notice to him in September, which became a turning point in the Maharashtra election.</p>
      <p>Pawar had managed to make it into an issue of ‘Maratha pride’, and a ‘Delhi vs Maharashtra’ battle, transforming NCP into an ascendant force, and reclaiming his own ‘Maratha strongman’ image, all at a time when NCP (and Congress) were both down and out.</p>
      <p>In politics, rarely are events prescripted, and Pawar is best at turning an evolving situation to his advantage. Whether by design or by default, or by just giving his nephew a long rope, Pawar may yet still end up killing many birds with one stone — clear the lines of succession in the party, keep his flock by his side and restore his own unchallenged authority in the party, which had begun to be questioned by Ajit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Family Show(down)</b>
      </p>
      <p>A showdown with Ajit had to come at some point or another, given the way tensions were building up in the family and party. Other regional parties have also faced this dilemma, be it Shiv Sena (Uddhav vs Raj Thackeray), or Akali Dal (Sukhbir vs Manpreet Singh Badal), or Samajwadi Party (Akhilesh vs Shivpal Yadav), etc.</p>
      <p>Pawar explained that Sule was interested in being in Delhi as an MP, and not in state politics. Any savvy politician knows that to be an effective player in Delhi, you need to be strong in the state.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar has also been grooming his grandnephew Rohit Pawar — another matter that has not gone down well with Ajit Pawar, who felt that his son Parth lost in the Lok Sabha polls because the party did not really put its weight behind his campaign.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar may well turn out to be on the losing side, if NCP MLAs, barring half a dozen, stay by Pawar Sr’s side. But the situation could change dramatically, yet once again, if BJP can get the requisite numbers in the trust vote, and ends up forming the government. At the time of writing, the game is wide open. If BJP flounders on numbers, it could be a Shiv Sena-NCPCongress government in Mumbai, and this could herald trouble for NDA.</p>
      <p>A political realignment in Maharashtra would send its own signal beyond the state. If the governor opts for President’s rule again, followed by elections, that too would suit the NCP and its chief.</p>
