      <p>O-Level candidates are now trooping back home after sweating it out writing the final exams. It was a walk in the park for some yet a Herculean undertaking for others writing same. <br/><br/>Parents, though not sitting for the exam the heartbeat is no more normal, what shall the results be like they ponder. <br/><br/>Anxious moments indeed and time seems stationary for those waiting for school examination results. Those waiting for HIV tests results would rather not see them, not school results. As parents we must not think all is lost when a child does not do well at O-Level. Try try try again if at first you do not succeed. <br/><br/>There is no harm in falling, the problem comes if you do not rise. Divine gifts and talents differ, some are good at soccer and others will excel at vocational training centres with only three O-levels to their credit. Where does your child fit, maybe can do well in tobacco farming or artisanal mining. <br/><br/>For those who can go to A-Level congratulations but if the going gets tough, the tough will not cry. Any loss is bereavement where counseling is needed. When results come out, sit down with your child to discuss what's next. What grades come out shall give the agenda and content of your discussion. <br/><br/>Of course its great when a child makes it up to tertiary institutions, call it father's and mother's pride. But, all is not lost when a child 'flungs' O-Level. Wishing all those affected the best. <br/><br/>Thomas Tondo Murisa. Chinehasha.</p>
