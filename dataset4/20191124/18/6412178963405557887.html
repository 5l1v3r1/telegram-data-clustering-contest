        <b>Oli McBurnie’s 90th minute strike salvaged a point for Sheffield United after Manchester United had come from two down to lead 3-2.</b>
      </p>
      <p>David De Gea was drawn into a magnificent double save after ten minutes, first stretching full-length to deny a magnificent John Lundstrum volley, before parrying a close range header from David McGoldrick from the cross that followed.</p>
      <p>John Fleck gave the Blades a deserved lead in the 19th minute as Lys Mousset easily outmuscled Phil Jones – handed his first Premier League start of the season – on the byline before crossing for John Lundstrum, whose shot was blocked before Fleck followed up to bundle home.</p>
      <p>United created nothing in a first half totally dominated by the home team, who looked incredibly comfortable.</p>
      <p>And Lys Mousset doubled Sheffield United’s lead shortly after half-time, firing brilliantly beyond a helpless De Gea, having been expertly played through by John Fleck, who picked up an assist to add to his earlier goal.</p>
      <p>Brandon Williams gave the visitors hope with 20 minutes remaining after his fine half-volleyed strike nestled into the far corner.</p>
      <p>Mason Greenwood – a second half substitute – then levelled the scores minutes later as he got on the end of a superb cross from Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p>It was Rashford who then completed an incredible turnaround for United as he converted Daniel James’ cross to give the visitors a 3-2 lead.</p>
      <p>But it was Sheffield United who had the last laugh, as Oli McBurnie controlled and smashed home to earn the Blades a well deserved draw at Bramall Lane.</p>
