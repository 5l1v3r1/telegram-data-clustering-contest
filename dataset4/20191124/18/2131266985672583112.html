      <p>The family of Grace Millane won't receive any compensation from the UK Government following the death of their daughter. </p>
      <p>Normally, UK families who have loved ones murdered in the UK or EU countries can apply for compensation.</p>
      <p>But because their daughter died outside those countries they are not entitled to a payout, reports ITV.</p>
      <p>Millane's body was found in a shallow grave in Auckland's Waitakere Ranges in December last year.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a jury found Millane's killer - who has name suppression - guilty of murder. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The case made headlines around the world and in Britain has sparked debate about who is entitled to compensation following such tragedies.</p>
      <p>According to the Sunday Express, Labour MP Jim Cunningham pressed the UK Government "to ensure families whose loved ones are murdered abroad have access to criminal injuries compensation".</p>
      <p>Following that, Justice Minister Wendy Morton said a review of the system was taking place.</p>
      <p>"A review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is under way, looking at its scope, and eligibility rules and requirements," Morton told the <i>Sunday Express</i>, reports ITV.</p>
      <p>"The recommendations of the Victims' Commissioner in her report on the entitlements and experiences of bereaved families following homicide abroad will be considered carefully as part of this review."</p>
      <p>Sentencing for the man found guilty of murdering Millane will be in February.</p>
