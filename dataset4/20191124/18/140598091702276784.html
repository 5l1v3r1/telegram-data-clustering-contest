      <h1>Women's Super League round-up: Vivianne Miedema scores winner for Arsenal as side keep pace with leaders Chelsea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:04:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-whyatt/" target="_blank">Katie Whyatt</a></address>
      <p><b>Arsenal</b> needed a Vivianne Miedema strike against rock-bottom <b>Liverpool </b>to keep pace with leaders <b>Chelsea</b> - a point ahead - and <b>Manchester City</b>, level on points with the Gunners but with a vastly superior goal difference following their 5-0 win over <b>Bristol City</b>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are still to score from open play in the WSL this season but Arsenal were guilty of spurning chances also, Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Danielle van de Donk all coming close but failing to score.</p>
      <p>Manchester City extended their WSL tally to six wins from seven, pushing five without reply past the Bristol City side against whom they could only manage two draws last term. Belgium forward Tessa Wullaert opened Manchester City's account, before Ellen White added their second - her fourth in five games for club and country. Pauline Bremer contributed City’s third and fifth either side of a Caroline Weir goal. The Robbins are still winless this season.</p>
      <p>In the most chaotic game of the afternoon, ten-woman <b>Reading</b> scored three times in seven second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down against West Ham.</p>
      <p>Matt Beard’s side had led via goals from Katharina Baunach and Leanne Kiernan, which bookended Rachel Rowe's dismissal. Kristine Leine, Brooke Chaplen and Jade Moore scored to revive the Royals, but Fara Williams - who hit the woodwork twice - and Sophie Howard could have added further damage. </p>
      <p><b>Manchester United </b>comfortably defeated <b>Brighton</b> via a Leah Galton double either side of a smart Lauren James finish from Galton’s cross. Captain Katie Zelem slammed home their fourth goal from the spot after Kirsty Hanson was tripped inside the area. </p>
      <p><b>Everton</b> won their third league game on the bounce by defeating <b>Tottenham</b> 3-1. Lucy Quinn equalised for Spurs to cancel out Molly Pike’s close-range finish, but an Anna Filbey own goal when goalkeeper Becky Spencer missed the ball at a corner, followed by a second-half finish from Lucy Graham gave Everton all three points. The home side remain fourth in the table, with Spurs slipping back to seventh.</p>
