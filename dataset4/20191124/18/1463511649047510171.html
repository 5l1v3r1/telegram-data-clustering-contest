      <h1>Shun cultism, drugs, Gbajabiamila tells students</h1>

      <p>The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has advised students to shun cultism, drugs and other vices capable of undermining their academic career and future.</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila spoke on Sunday in Lagos at the end of a two-day counselling and health programme organised for students in his Surulere 1 Federal Constituency.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the programme, which featured career talks, counselling and free medical screenings and treatments, was organised by Gbaja Professionals Volunteer Network, a volunteer group.</p>
      <p>The speaker said drugs, cultism, teenage pregnancy and others were dream killers, urging students to avoid them.</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila advised students to rather take their education seriously, saying they could achieve their life goals through education.</p>
      <p>He said he had visited schools across the country to teach students and counsel them against drugs, cultism and other vices.</p>
      <p>Gbajabamiala said that the teaching programme, which he undertook periodically, was to inspire students to greatness.</p>
      <p>“Now, when I go round to teach the children, I always make sure I address certain things away from academics.</p>
      <p>“There are certain things that are important in education beyond the classroom education.</p>
      <p>“The issue of drugs that have permeated our society today is something I never hesitate to talk to the children about, because of its danger.</p>
      <p>“The same thing with drugs, being out of school, cultism and so on. Dear students, those things take you nowhere, and they take you nowhere fast.</p>
      <p>“So, it is important that you continue to imbibe the culture of going to school regularly, staying away from drugs; beware of teenage pregnancy, beware of cultism and other things that can affect your future,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said he was glad that feedback from his teaching programme showed some students were beginning to imbibe the right values.</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila also urged students to always respect their parents and to always take to their advice, especially on education.</p>
      <p>He said without education, it would be impossible for him to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>The speaker commended the volunteer group for organising the programme, saying the initiative was noteworthy as it concerned the health and education of children.</p>
      <p>He identified education and health as key to development, adding that no nation could achieve progress with uneducated and unhealthy citizens.</p>
      <p>While promising to always support anything that would uplift his people, Gbajabiamila said he was particularly happy that the initiative was taking off from his constituency.</p>
      <p>According to him, he will continue to support the volunteer group as it reaches out to students in other parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Coordinator of the group, Lukman Lawal, said the programme would be taken to the six-geopolitical zones of the country to counsel students on the need to study hard and shun vices.</p>
      <p>According to him, the programme, which addresses some health needs of students, is an initiative to complement government’s efforts on education and health.</p>
      <p>“We believe government alone cannot do everything, and that is why we, professionals under the network, are volunteering to support government by rendering some services to the people,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that some top company executives were part of the volunteer group, saying the mission of the group was to touch the lives of as many students as possible.</p>
