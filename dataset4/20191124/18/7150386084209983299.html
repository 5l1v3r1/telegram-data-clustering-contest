They have two matches so far, losing one while the other game was abandoned due to rain. They are yet to win the first match of the tournament. Their first match was against the team Canterbury in which they well scored 349 runs for the loss of 4 wickets. Unfortunately it was ended in no result due to the interference of rain when the opponent team started chasing the target. In the next match, they lost to Auckland by a big margin of 100 runs.</p>
