      <p>Smoking inside the Bouzoukia at venues across Greece may be coming to an end with the new anti-smoking law forcing smokers to gather outside to light up at the Antonis Remos concert in Thessaloniki on Sunday night, as to avoid a 500 euro fine.</p>
      <p>A video of the smokers outside the concert has gone viral, as a guest, at the event, Michalis Tzemptimpis filmed dozens of smokers in the early hours of the morning walking outside the well-known Thessaloniki venue, while Antonis Remos was still performing.</p>
      <p>According to <i>voria.gr,</i> the smokers missed parts of the show as they headed outside to light up, wanting to avoid being fined $500 euro, which is the amount any individual caught smoking inside a public space in Greece will be charged.</p>
      <p>The Greek government last week announced they are cracking down on those who break the law and also launched a new hotline for the public to call and report individuals and businesses not adhering to the anti-smoking law.</p>
      <p>Most Bouzoukia venues around the country are also likely to enforce the ban as they will risk being fined 10,000 euros.</p>
