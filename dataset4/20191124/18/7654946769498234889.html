      <h1>NFL doesn’t want Myles Garrett missing 2020 games after ugly brawl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:02:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jaclyn Hendricks</a></address>
      <p>Myles Garrett could return to the field as early as next year should everything go according to the NFL’s plans, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28152508/sources-nfl-hopeful-myles-garrett-miss-games-next-season">ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Sunday</a>, citing league sources.</p>
      <p>The league has reportedly instructed Garrett, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/myles-garrett-to-appeal-nfl-suspension-after-helmet-attack/">suspended indefinitely</a> after striking Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph in the head with Rudolph’s helmet, to meet with commissioner Roger Goodell’s office during the offseason. The meeting is said to see how Garrett reacts to his suspension, which has since been upheld.</p>
      <p>League sources tell ESPN the NFL will be “open-minded” during the sit-down with Garrett. Should the Pro Bowler’s “behavior” be “what the league hopes it will be,” the likelihood of Garrett not missing 2020 playing time is high.</p>
      <p>Garrett has since been fined $45,623 for the Nov. 14 melee in Cleveland, in which the Browns defeated the Steelers 21-7. Rudolph <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/nfl-punishes-mason-rudolph-for-myles-garrett-fight/">was also fined</a> $50,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Garrett <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/myles-garrett-mason-rudolphs-racial-slur-ignited-helmet-attack/">claimed he lost his temper</a> as a result of Rudolph allegedly using a racial slur. The Steelers quarterback denied the accusation.</p>
      <p>The Browns face the Dolphins on Sunday in Miami in their first game since Garrett’s suspension.</p>
