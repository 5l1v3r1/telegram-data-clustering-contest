      </p>
      <p>A long-time Westlife fan recently opened up about how the band's song "I'll See You Again" gave her peace, following the death of her son Conor.</p>
      <p>Sinead Doyle attended Friday night's show of the Late Late where she gave a beautiful recollection on how the song helped her cope.</p>
      <p>Her son was stillborn at 38 weeks, some four years ago, and Sinead remembers one day she was out walking and the song came on.</p>
      <p>I'll See You Again was included in a playlist she was listening to at the time. And it just hit her. She felt at peace about the death during listening.</p>

      <p>Addressing The Late Late Show crowd she said:</p>
      <p>"I have a favourite song, I'll See You Again. When I heard it a few years ago I didn't really pay much attention, it was a nice song.</p>
      <p>"I'm a huge fan for years and years. Our son died four years ago. He was born sleeping at 38 weeks.</p>
      <p>"That was four years ago and about a year ago I was out walking, I have the playlist of all the albums and it (I'll See You Again) came on.</p>

      <p>"People used to say to me 'Oh there's a feather', that must be Conor. And when you lose someone you kind of get angry and you go 'Yeah whatever'.</p>
      <p>"I heard the song again and I hadn't heard it in a long time. It gave me peace."</p>
      <p>Following her heartfelt recollection, Sinead was then invited up on stage by host Ryan Tubridy to meet Westlife who were guests of the show on the night.</p>

      <p>Nicky Byrne, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan and Kian Egan all embraced the woman one by one, visibly touched by her story.</p>
      <p>Ryan then asked Sinead did she have children, to which she replied: "I do, I have a five-year-old, Conor would have been four in August.</p>
      <p>"I have a two-year-old and a one-year-old. I have Liam, Conor, Maria and Megan."</p>
      <p>She then joked before she returned to her seat: "I'm 40 next year, I'd like a ticket to Cork."</p>
