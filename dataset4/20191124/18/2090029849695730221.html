      <p>Help however came his way through international player Ogenyi Onazi who played alongside Sanni at the junior level.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel, who was named the best player at the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup has been suffering from Achilles tendonitis – which forced his early retirement from football.</p>

      <p>Following his inability to foot the bill for his surgery, the 26-year-old solicited for help on social media.</p>
      <p>However, it was his former Nigeria and Lazio teammate Onazi who offered to come to the rescue of the ex-Beitar Jerusalem striker.</p>
      <p>He took to his Instagram page to acknowledge receipt of the payment</p>
      <blockquote>I got a call from the doctor that @onaziogenyi has paid 1.4m for my surgery and also transferred 50k for my ticket to Lagos..thank you very much brother May God continue to bless you..the surgery is scheduled for 2nd of December 2019</blockquote>
