        <b>Montpellier lock 'does a Vahaamahina'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jacques du Plessis was sent off earlier today during Montpellier's match against Gloucester for an act that is being compared to that of Sebastien Vahaamahina.</p>
      <p>The French lock was shown red in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final against for elbowing Aaron Wainwright in the jaw in the middle of a maul.</p>
      <p>Around the hour mark at the GGL Stadium a similar incident played out as du Plessis wrestled with Gerbrandt Grobler at the centre of a maul before proceeding to elbow him square in the face.</p>
      <p>When checking with his TMO, referee George Clancy asked: "Is this like the one with France in the World Cup?"</p>
      <p>The lock was shown a red card for the offence but his side held on for a 30-27 victory.</p>

        <b>Tipuric insists there was never bad blood with Warburton</b>
      </p>
      <p>For years, Justin Tipuric was unable to oust Sam Warburton from the Wales No.7 jersey.</p>
      <p>But he insists that there was always a respect between the pair, who always complemented each other brilliantly when they played together for their country.</p>
      <p>“There was respect there,” Tipuric told WalesOnline. <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/justin-tipuric-interview-sleepless-nights-17297971">You can read the full interview here.</a></p>
      <p>“Sam was a world-class player and there was no sense that we didn’t get on.</p>
      <p>“Selection going against you is just the way the game can go.</p>
      <p>“Everyone wants to start and when I was younger I might have been a bit more frustrated with not beginning a match.</p>
      <p>“But the older you get the more you are able to put things into perspective and think how lucky you are just to be playing for your country.</p>
      <p>“You try to get on with everyone. That’s what being part of a team is all about. The side has to come first.”</p>

        <b>Irish pundit calls Lyon 's**te'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Irish pundit Neil Francis has been airing his views on the weekend's rugby, suggesting that Lyon dragged Leinster down during their 13-6 win over the French side.</p>
      <p>"A good start is everything and Leinster looked competent and composed as they got themselves into a 10-0 lead after 24 minutes," wrote the ex-Ireland international in <a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/champions-cup/neil-francis-leinster-were-so-far-from-perfect-that-you-have-to-complain-because-lyon-were-absolutely-atrocious-38720066.html">his column for the Irish Independent.</a></p>
      <p>"However, the amount of time they go without scoring is bewildering. Leinster did not manage to score again until the 77th minute. It begs the question, what on earth were they doing for the intervening 53 minutes?</p>
      <p>"It is a tough test trying to deal with yourself and that is exactly what this contest was about because Lyon were absolutely shite.</p>
      <p>"If they are the best team in the Top 14 then that says much about the lack of quality in that competition."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Edwards on his respect for Wales</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now former Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards says he has too much respect for Wales to celebrate if France beat them in this year's Six Nations.</p>
      <p>Following the conclusion of his WRU contract, Edwards is now on Les Bleus' coaching staff and will face Wales early next year.</p>
      <p>But in an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-7718609/The-one-got-away-France-gain-England-Wales-loss-Shaun-Edwards-plots-new-start.html">interview with the Daily Mail</a> , he vowed not to celebrate greatly if his new team come out on top.</p>
      <p>"If France beat Wales, I won’t celebrate too much," said Edwards.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got a lot of respect for Wales and the Welsh public. I won’t be throwing up my arms in the air."</p>

        <b>Sale Sharks in negotiations to sign AWOL Fiji star</b>
      </p>
      <p>Racing 92 have suspended second row Leone Nakarawa after arriving back in Paries two weeks late after the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>But now it has emerged that Sale are in negotiations to bring him to the England.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for a high-quality lock,” Sale boss Steve Diamond said. “He’s apparently gone missing but we’ve tracked him down and we’re in negotiations at the moment.”</p>
