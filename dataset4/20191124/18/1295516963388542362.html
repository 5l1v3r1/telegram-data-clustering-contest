      <p>Erica Durance -- who played iconic DC Comics reporter Lois Lane on the Superman prequel series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/smallville/">Smallville</a> -- has opened up out what it's like to step into the character's shoes once again for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>. The highly-anticipated Arrowverse crossover event will see Durance reprise her role as Lois alongside fellow <i>Smallville</i> graduate Tom Welling, who played Clark Kent/Superman.</p>
      <p>"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together," Durance said of Lois and Clark's role in <i>Crisis</i> in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/crisis-on-infinite-earths-smallville-erica-durance-preview/">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "It's a full-circle moment that's really nice."</p>

      <p>While <i>Smallville</i> ended eight years ago, Durance has remained close to the <a href="https://screenrant.com/smallville-superman-crisis-crossover-then-now-speculation/">Superman</a> mythos. Since 2017, she has appeared on The CW's Arrowverse series <i>Supergirl</i> as Alura Zor-El, the biological mother of Kara Zor-El/Kara Danvers. As such, Durance was surprised when the producers optioned the idea of her returning to the role of Lois Lane.</p>

      <p>"My first thought was like, 'Really? How are you going to manage this?'" Durance confessed. "But the writers are just spectacular about how they can pull all the different shows together and all of these different characters, and they make sense of all the timelines. So I was at first very, very curious to see what it would be, and getting to actually go out and do it, I of course was very excited to go back and get to play Lois again."</p>
      <p>From there, Durance spoke to her first day back on the Kent Farm alongside Welling. "It was bizarre [because] it felt like we hadn't missed a beat," she said. "It was just easy. It was like coming back in and working with family. It was a little bit bizarre because we went back on somebody else's show, but we're in a set that we're familiar with, the farm and all those things. So it was very, very cool."</p>
      <p><i>Smallville</i> premiered on The WB -- The CW's predecessor -- in the fall of 2001. Durance boarded the series as Lois Lane for its fourth season in 2004, and remained a major cast member up until the finale in 2011.</p>
