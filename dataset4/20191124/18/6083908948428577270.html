      <h1>Are You a Trump Supporter? According to CNN, You've Been Brainwashed by 'Cult Leader' Trump.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:27:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bethbaumann" target="_blank">Beth Baumann</a></address>
      <p>Just when we thought CNN couldn't get any more ridiculous, host Brian Stelter proves us wrong. On Sunday, Stelter dedicated an entire segment of his show talking to cult expert Steve Hassan about the characteristics President Trump exhibits that make him a "cult leader."</p>
      <p>According to Hassan, "cliches" Trump uses, like "fake news," "build the wall" and "Make America Great Again" play into this so-called "mind control" that he has over his followers.</p>
      <p>“You say the president is using mind control, but how is that provable?” Stelter asked.</p>
      <p>“So we can start with the pathological lying, which is characteristic of destructive cult leaders. Saying things in a very confident way that have nothing to do with facts or truthfulness," Hassan explained. "The blaming others and never taking responsibility for his own failures and faults. Shunning and kicking out anyone who raises questions or concerns about his own behavior. His use of fear mongering, immigration is a horrible thing.”</p>
      <p>But Hassan's biggest issue with Trump appeared to be the president taking on the fake news media.</p>
      <p>"Freedom of the press is absolutely vital for a healthy country. And anyone like him that says press is the enemy of the people, that’s what Hubbard would say. That’s what Moon said. That’s what LaRouche said," he explained. "Why? Because they're demagogues.”</p>
      <p>Stelter wanted to know how to "deprogram" Trump's so-called "cult."</p>
      <p>“The first step with anyone who’s a true believer is contact with people that are outside the bubble. Cult leaders want to isolate their people. They want — they want family and friends to just disappear rather than keep engaged," Hassan explained. "'Hey, did you read this article? What do you think of it? You know, I’ll watch one of your shows. Watch one of my shows.' In other words, appealing to the person’s true self, their authentic self, that wants to be a good person, that wants — that believes in America and democracy and truth.”</p>
      <p>So apparently anyone who supports President Trump is now brainwashed and part of a cult? Apparently anyone who was tired of the typical liberal mainstream news media feeding their propaganda is suddenly brainwashed. Oh, and wanting good paying jobs, a low unemployment rate and a booming economy is a bad thing?</p>
      <p>The mainstream media is in a panic because Trump has opened the eyes of many average Americans who are tired of politics as usual. They're tired of being politicians' political pawns. They're tired of every other country's needs being put before their own. And Trump understood their frustration when he ran for office. He's taken a stand on behalf of the middle class and everyday people. It's the reason he has growing support.</p>
      <p>Garbage segments like this just reinforce the notion that the mainstream media only cares about the leftist agenda. The American people have seen through their shenanigans.</p>
      <p>And CNN wonders why their ratings have tanked.</p>
