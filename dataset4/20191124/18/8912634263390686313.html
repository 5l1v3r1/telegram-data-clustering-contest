      <p>KABUL: A foreign national was killed and at least five other people wounded in a grenade attack on a United Nations vehicle in Kabul on Sunday, an Afghan official said.<br/>The attack happened on a road frequently used by UN traffic shuttling workers between central Kabul and a large UN compound on the outskirts of the capital.<br/>“At around 6:20 p.m. (1350 GMT) a grenade was hurled at a UN vehicle,” interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.<br/>Aside from the one fatality, Rahimi said five other people were wounded. The nationalities of the other victims were not released.<br/>In a statement condemning the attack, the UN confirmed the fatality and said two other staff members — one Afghan and one international — were wounded.<br/>“It is with profound sadness that the UN family in Afghanistan confirms the killing tonight of a colleague, as well as injuries to two others, when a UN-marked vehicle was attacked in Kabul,” the statement read.<br/>No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and the Taliban did not respond to a query.<br/>The blast comes during what has been a period of relative and uneasy calm in Kabul, where the rate of large-scale attacks has dropped in recent weeks.<br/>The comparative lull followed a blood-stained presidential campaign season that ended with a general election nearly two months ago.<br/>But Afghans are still waiting for the results of that September 28 poll, with a recount bogged down by various technical difficulties and complaints from main candidates.<br/>Additionally, Afghans are waiting to see what might happen next in negotiations between the Taliban and the US.<br/>President Donald Trump in September ended those yearlong talks as Taliban violence continued, but on Friday he suggested to US broadcaster Fox News that negotiations could be getting underway again.<br/>Aid agencies and non-governmental groups are sometimes targeted in Afghanistan’s war.<br/>For instance, the Taliban in May targeted Counterpart International, a US-funded non-profit group working with marginalized people. Nine people were killed in that attack.<br/>But the UN’s white vehicles, easily identifiable with the world body’s initials painted on the side, are rarely involved in attacks and circulate routinely around Kabul and in the provinces.<br/>In 2011, seven foreign UN workers — including four Nepalis, a Swede, a Norwegian and a Romanian — were killed in an attack on a UN compound in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</p>
