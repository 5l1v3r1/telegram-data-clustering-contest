      <p>The Reds were earlier held to a 1-1 draw with St Johnstone this afternoon.</p>
      <p>An Aberdeen statement read: "The Aberdonian and lifelong Dons fan will take up the reins from Stewart Milne immediately after the Club’s Annual General Meeting on 16th of December.</p>
      <p>After 22 years at the helm of AFC, Stewart Milne is stepping down as part of a planned succession process that paves the way for fresh investment."</p>
      <p>Mr Milne added: "For four years, we’ve been working on a succession plan. It’s been no easy task to find the right person who is willing to take on the onerous role of Chairman, with responsibility for both the financial health and growth of the Club.</p>

      <p>“In bringing Dave onto the Board and then appointing him vice-chairman, we viewed him as the natural successor.</p>
      <p>"He qualifies on both counts. He is prepared to take on the commitment and has already proved his ability to secure significant new investment. Importantly, he is passionate about Aberdeen and the Club.</p>
      <p>“I have always said I would relinquish the reins when the right opportunity arose and I believe that time has now come.</p>
      <p>"I’m proud to have had the opportunity to lead the Club I love for over two decades. It’s been a real privilege but not without its challenges!</p>
      <p>"Like the fans, I’ve shared in a rollercoaster of emotions from pure joy and exhilaration through to frustration and despair.</p>
      <p>“We have been in a consistently healthier position for several years now and I’m pleased to be able to hand the Club over to safe hands in the knowledge that we are debt-free and have more than doubled revenues from around £7.8million in 2013 to almost £16million today.</p>
      <p>“The opening of the £12million Cormack Park represents the completion of phase one of our vision for a new home.</p>
      <p>"We’ve achieved this while still increasing the first team budget to its highest level yet and continuing to invest in our youth programme. Our annual spend on the overall football operation now amounts to £9million.”</p>
      <p>Mr Cormack has delivered £11.2million of new investment.</p>
      <p>The lifelong fan commented: "I’m honoured and privileged to become chairman of the famous Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>"I’m also pleased to be able to announce a strategic partnership with Atlanta United, details of which will be announced tomorrow, and further investment from myself, Tom and Roger."</p>
