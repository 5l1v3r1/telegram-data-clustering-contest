      <h1>Bacteria allies to control dengue virus discovered</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:55:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Recruiting a bacterial ally that infects mosquitoes has led to huge reductions in cases of dengue fever, trials around the world show.</p>
      <p><i>Wolbachia</i> bacteria make it harder for the insects to spread the virus, rather than kill them off, according to a report published in <i>BBC News.</i></p>
      <p>Researchers say the findings are a “big deal” with cases falling by more than 70% in field trials.</p>
      <p>New ways of controlling dengue are urgently needed as cases have exploded worldwide in the past 50 years.</p>
      <p>In Pakistan thousands of people have been affected by the dengue fever this year and 68 of them have lost their lives only in Punjab.</p>
      <p><i>Wolbachia</i> bacteria make it harder for the dengue virus to grow inside the mosquito.</p>
      <p>It is thought the bacteria camp out in areas inside mosquitoes that the dengue virus needs to get into and that the bacteria use up resources that the virus needs.</p>

      <p>If the dengue virus cannot replicate and increase its numbers in the mosquito then it is much less likely to be transmitted when the insect bites again.</p>
      <p>Many species of insects are naturally infected by the bacterium, including the tiny fruit flies dancing around your kitchen. But the main mosquito that spreads dengue fever – Aedes aegypti – is not normally affected.</p>
      <p>So, researchers have been micro-injecting species of Wolbachia into tiny mosquito eggs to see which bacteria can thrive in different climates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is dengue?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dengue fever is caused by a virus that is spread from person to person by blood-sucking mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>The symptoms vary wildly with some people showing no sign of infection, others have bad flu-like symptoms, while some are killed by dengue.</p>
      <p>The disease is commonly known as “break-bone fever” because it causes severe pain in muscles and bones.</p>
      <p>In the worst cases, people develop “dengue haemorrhagic fever”, which kills 25,000 people a year around the world.</p>
