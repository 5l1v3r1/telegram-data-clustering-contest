      <h1>Revealed: The number of people who don't earn the real living wage in Nottinghamshire</h1>
      <h2>Mansfield and Newark are some of the worst areas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:08:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Pridmore</a></address>
      <p>New figures claim thousands of people across Nottinghamshire are not earning a 'real living wage'.</p>
      <p>Produced by the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), the figures show more than one third of employees in some parts of the East Midlands don't earn the hourly rate.</p>
      <p>The real living wage is a voluntary rate set by the Living Wage Foundation which hundreds of employers have signed up to - including <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/boris-johnson-meets-staff-patients-3570200">Bassetlaw</a> District Council and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/robin-hood-energy-can-continue-3480489">Robin Hood Energy</a> in Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>The real living wage was increased from £9 to £9.30 at the start of November, differing from the Government's national living wage which currently stands at £8.21 an hour.</p>
      <p>Now, the new figures have revealed thousands of people in Nottinghamshire don't earn that amount.</p>
      <p>The figures, broken down by parliamentary constituency, show that Mansfield and Newark have the highest number of people in the county who don't earn the wage.</p>
