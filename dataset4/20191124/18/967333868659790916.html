      <p>​The spokesman did not specify the nationality of the deceased. No group has claimed the responsibility for the attack so far.</p>
      <p>The deadly incident comes less than two weeks after a car bomb attack in the Afghan capital <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911201077355302-us-soldiers-helicopter-crash-afghanistan/">killed seven people</a> and wounded seven more.</p>
      <p>The explosion comes as the Afghan government and the Taliban movement have agreed to an exchange of prisoners, despite ongoing clashes in the country.</p>
      <p>​The government has also declared its victory over the Daesh* terror group, stating that it was eliminated from its stronghold in eastern Nangarhar Province. According to Kabul, the organisation has only small cells across the country that will be destroyed by Afghan forces.</p>
