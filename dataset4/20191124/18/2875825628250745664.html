      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:04:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price's estranged husband Kieran Hayler has hinted he's not got a cool head after the former glamour model took one of his pictures of their kids for her own <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Kieran, 32, posted a snap of Bunny, five and Jett, six, looking adorable dressed up in old timey clothes.</p>
      <p>Mum Katie, 41, followed suit - the day after, according to Instagram's time stamp - posting the cute snap with a string of heart emojis.</p>
      <p>Kieran might not be alright with that, though, as he shared a quote with his fans that read: "Never be intimidated by someone who copies you. The original is always better than the copy."</p>
      <p>Katie and her third husband have had a turbulent and troubled relationship, meeting online back in 2012.</p>

      <p>They got hitched in an intimate Bahamas ceremony the year after, with Katie announcing she was expecting her fourth child just a month later - Jett was born in August 2013.</p>
      <p>She'd been married twice before - to I'm A Celeb co-star Peter Andre from 2005 to 2009 and stripper Alex Reid from 2010 to 2012.</p>
      <p>Days after Katie revealed she was pregnant again - with Bunny - Kieran's cheating came to light.</p>
      <p>It was made all the more dramatic by the fact it had been with one of Pricey's closest pals and a bridesmaid at their wedding, Jane Pountney.</p>

      <p>Kieran headed to sex addiction therapy around the same time that another of his affairs was revealed....with another of Katie's friends.</p>
      <p>She told fans she'd be divorcing Kieran in August 2017 after she claimed she found emails showing his affair with their nanny Nikki Brown.</p>
      <p>Katie's had an up and down love life since then - she's now back with toyboy lover Kris Boyson.</p>

      <p>The mum of five had initially dumped Kris by text while she partied away with her new flame Charles Drury.</p>
      <p>That soon came to an end and Katie reunited with Kris.</p>
      <p>She hasn't been shy about their relationship, revealing in a radio interview that she might even be walking down the aisle again next year.</p>
      <p>"Next year maybe a baby and a wedding," she told Flex FM soon after the rumours of their reunion first began to swirl.</p>
      <p>It's now claimed that Katie's keen to get hitched again to rile ex-husband Peter Andre.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/">Closer</a> : "Katie does genuinely love Kris and wants to marry him but she can't help seeing the wedding as a way of getting one over on Pete, too.</p>
      <p>"Her life has been a mess recently and she hasn't been able to stand the thought of Pete pitying her while he's got a 'perfect' home life with his wife Emily."</p>
