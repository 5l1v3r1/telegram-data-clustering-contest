                            <p>This could have been the ultimate reason for happiness for Manchester United, who saw their club perform poorly in the most part of the game, but it was limited for only a few minutes, as Oli McBurnie volleyed the ball to beat David De Gea in the 90th minute to claim a point from the game.</p>
                            <p>Initially, the goal was examined by the VAR for a handball but it was discovered that it was McBurnie’s shoulder in contact. Thus, ending the game in a sensational scoreline of 3-3.</p>
