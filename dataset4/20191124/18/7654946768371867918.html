      <p>A former lap dancer says Prince Andrew once greeted her at Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan pad by burying his face between her breasts and blowing a raspberry.</p>
      <p>“I was shocked, but I laughed, thinking, ‘Wow, what was that?’ … I guess being a prince gives you those privileges,” the woman <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ex-lapdancer-says-prince-andrew-20946791">told the Sunday Mirror of Britain</a>.</p>
      <p>“Anyone doing that in a bar or in the street would have got a punch in the face, believe me.”</p>
      <p>The ex-exotic dancer said she had been paid by Epstein, a multimillionaire pedophile, to hire young women for the party, including those specifically tailored to Andrew’s tastes — big-breasted and curvy, like his former wife, <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/sarah-ferguson/">Sarah Ferguson</a>.</p>
      <p>“They were mostly older teens paid $200, $300,” the woman said, adding that there were rooms upstairs in the posh townhouse set up for sex.</p>
      <p>“It was a big night, really important for Jeffrey. The girls had been specially selected to try to please Andrew,” said the woman, now 47, who was only identified as “Tiffany Doe.”</p>
      <p>“Epstein made it clear he wanted to make Andrew happy. I was told to make sure he was looked after, that he had a drink, that he was OK.</p>
      <p>“The duke seemed in good spirits and was out to enjoy himself. I always thought Andrew liked my breasts. When he started to say hello, he looked at them first rather than me,” the woman said.</p>
      <p>“He leaned forward and put his face on them and blew a raspberry.”</p>
      <p>She said she laughed and that the prince “laughed, too. He’d never done it before, and I thought, ‘It’s going to be a good night.’</p>
      <p>“He said I should be in a magazine for big-breasted women.”</p>
      <p>The woman said such raspberry-blowing is known as “motor-boating,” although the “Randy Andy” royal fumbled when he tried to recall the term.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t quite know the term ‘motorboat.’ He said, ‘Motor… something?’</p>
      <p>“He was trying to come off cool, but he didn’t know the words. I found him quite awkward, quite clumsy,” she said.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t clear exactly when the party was, but the woman said she had been to previous gigs that Andrew attended.</p>
      <p>“I saw Andrew at parties a couple of times a year, if not more. I would flirt with him and he would hit on me and was handsy. He would stand in close proximity, looking at my breasts,” the woman said.</p>
      <p>“He would hold my hands, put his arm around my waist, stroke my cheek. He used royalty, his celebrity, to his advantage.”</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has come under fire for his ties to Epstein, who authorities have said committed suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Andrew has been accused of raping an underage Epstein “sex slave,” who was allegedly 17 at the time, and knowing about at least some of his financier pal’s behavior.</p>
      <p>The prince has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, including in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">a disastrous TV interview</a> earlier this month in which he offered outrageous claims about the two men’s time together.</p>
