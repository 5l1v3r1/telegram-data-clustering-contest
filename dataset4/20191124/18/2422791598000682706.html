      <p>MADRID -- Roberto Bautista Agut defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (3), 6-3 on Sunday to give Spain a 1-0 lead over Canada in the best-of-three Davis Cup final.</p>
      <p>The No. 9-ranked Bautista Agut was playing his first match since the death of his father earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Auger-Aliassime, ranked No. 21, missed six weeks of action with an ankle injury. He was playing for the first time since the opening round of the Shanghai Masters in early October.</p>
      <p>The Canadian is competing in the final at a Davis Cup for the first time. Canada first appeared in the international team tournament in 1913.</p>
      <p>Spain, a five-time Davis Cup champion, is playing in its 10th final.</p>
      <p>Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., was to play world No. 1 Rafael Nadal later Sunday in a must-win second singles rubber for Canada.</p>
