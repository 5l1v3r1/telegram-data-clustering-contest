      <h1>Group urges farmers to seek rice safeguard</h1>

      <p>The Federation of Philippine Industries urged farmers to file a petition to the national government to subject rice imports to safeguard measures as a check and balance mechanism to avert another surge in rice imports.</p>
      <p>FPI chairman Jesus Arranza said the application of safeguard mechanism seemed to be the fastest way to address the import surge of rice.</p>
      <p>“It is not hard to prove that there is an import since it is a reality known to government’s top hierarchy. Even the President and top Agriculture officials know of the import surge, prompting the President to momentarily suspend rice importations,” Arranza said.</p>
      <p>He said other consumer goods imports like ceramic tiles, flat glass, steel and cement had been subjected to safeguard tariffs.</p>
      <p>The imposition of safeguard measures on these products helped the affected sectors address their concerns.</p>
      <p>Safeguard duty is an additional tariff imposed on top of regular levies.</p>
      <p>The group also reminded rice stakeholders that the Tariff Commission still had 200 days to review the proposed safeguards on rice.</p>
