      <h2>Manchester United scored three goals in a seven-minute span from the 72nd to go ahead in dramatic fashion.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:52:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/ap/" target="_blank">AP</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United conceded a 90th-minute equalizer after recovering from a two-goal deficit to draw 3-3 with Sheffield United in a wild Premier League match on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Oli McBurnie’s goal required a review by VAR for a possible handball but it was awarded — to loud roars by the home fans at Bramall Lane — to stop Man United climbing to fifth place in the standings.</p>
      <p>Having fallen 2-0 down after 52 minutes, Man United scored three goals in a seven-minute span from the 72nd to go ahead in dramatic fashion.</p>
      <p>All of those goals were scored by academy graduates, with 19-year-old Brandon Williams and 18-year-old Mason Greenwood netting for the first time in the league before Marcus Rashford completed the remarkable comeback.</p>
