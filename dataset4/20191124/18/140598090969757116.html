      <h1>Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg enters Democrat presidential race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:02:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/david-millward/" target="_blank">David Millward</a></address>
      <p>After weeks of speculation, former <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/13/democrats-2020-could-michael-bloomberg-dethrone-donald-trump/">New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> has entered the crowded race for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old billionaire, ranked by Forbes as the 11th richest man in the world, announced his candidature on his website pledging to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild the country.</p>
      <p>"We cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions.</p>
      <p>“He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage."</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg’s decision to enter the race has raised questions over how his publishing company will cover the campaign.</p>
      <p>In an email to staff, Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait said they would not be investigating its founder.</p>
      <p>"We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation) and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.</p>
      <p>“We cannot treat Mike's Democratic competitors differently from him."</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg is the second Democratic moderate to throw his hat into the ring in less than a fortnight, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-could-former-massachusetts-governor-deval-patrick/">following Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts.</a></p>
      <p>Both entered the race amid fears that former vice president Joe Biden is in danger of being eclipsed by<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/01/investors-getting-twitchy-elizabeth-warren-making-white-house/"> Elizabeth Warren, the Left-wing Massachusetts senator who has vowed to impose steep tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to pay for her ambitious “Medicare for All” proposals.</a></p>
      <p>Within minutes of Mr Bloomberg’s announcement, the Warren team sent out a fund-raising appeal to supporters, accusing him of using his wealth to buy the nomination.</p>
      <p>“Since filing paperwork to join the presidential race two days ago, Michael Bloomberg has poured over $30 million into buying a week's worth of ads in media markets all over the country,” supporters were told in an email.</p>

      <p>“That's more than any candidate in the history of our elections. So we're wondering: How much money is Michael Bloomberg going to spend before he talks to a single voter?”</p>
      <p>The broadside reflects the uphill struggle Mr Bloomberg - a former Republican and independent - faces in garnering support from grass-roots Democrat activists in a party which has been moving left since Hillary Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in 2016.</p>
      <p>In a series of campaign videos, Mr Bloomberg has made his pitch as a “middle class kid” who made good first as a businessman and then as New York’s mayor.</p>
      <p>He highlighted his record in taking on the gun and coal lobbies - causes close to the hearts of Democrat voters. </p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg has also moved to head off hostility from black voters by apologising for the “stop and frisk” powers he gave police during his 12 years as mayor which, critics say, targeted African Americans disproportionately.</p>
      <p>While Mr Bloomberg has abundant wealth, he may find time is against him - especially in the early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, where his rivals have had months to put campaign teams in place.</p>
      <p>It is thought he will concentrate his efforts on “Super Tuesday” - March 3 2020 - when 14 states will be holding primaries, including Texas and California.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Adam Schiff, the Democrat congressman chairing the explosive impeachment hearings in Washington, justified the inquiry against a sustained onslaught from Donald Trump and his supporters.</p>
      <p>Speaking on CNN, Mr Schiff denied the hearings were a partisan exercise.</p>
      <p>“If there isn’t a deterrent, you can be darn sure the president will commit another egregious act,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I hope there will be Republicans willing to step forward. If this was Barack Obama who had done this, they would have impeached him in a heartbeat.”</p>
