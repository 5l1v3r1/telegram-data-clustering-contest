      <h3>Gary Lineker praised Manchester United’s comeback on Twitter despite the visitors being denied a crucial win by Sheffield United’s added-time equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils made a poor start to the Premier League clash at Bramall Lane after John Fleck capitalised on a Phil Jones’ error to put the promoted side ahead in the 19th minute.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United doubled the advantage in the second half when Lys Mousset found the net in the 52nd minute to leave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer contemplating successive away defeats.</p>
      <p>However, Manchester United showed their fighting spirit when Brandon Williams halved the deficit with his debut goal for the club in the 72nd minute before another teenager Mason Greenwood levelled the Premier League clash in the 77th minute.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford completed an incredible seven-minute spell for the visitors when he handed the visitors a narrow 3-2 lead with 11 minutes left to play.</p>
      <p>But Manchester United were unable to cling on for victory after Oli McBurnie levelled for the home side in added time at the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs forward Lineker hailed Manchester United’s incredible comeback after Rashford’s goal.</p>
      <p>Lineker wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198664064211259392?s=20">Twitter</a>: “Wow! What a turnaround that is. Football eh.”</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t long before the Match Of The Day pundit was on Twitter again to reflect on the six-goal thriller.</p>
      <p>He posted after full-time: “3-3. McBonkers.”</p>
      <p>Sheffield United remain a point ahead of Manchester United thanks to their dramatic equaliser at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have only managed to win one of their last four Premier League games to leave Solskjaer’s side nine points behind Chelsea FC in fourth spot.</p>
