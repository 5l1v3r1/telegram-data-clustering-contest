      <h1>Pilot Walks Away Uninjured After Plane Gets Caught Upside Down in Power Lines</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:27:47+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/tara-law/" target="_blank">Tara Law</a></address>
      <p>A pilot walked away uninjured after crashing a single-engine propeller plane into power lines in Louisville Township, Minn., on Saturday, police say.</p>
      <p>The Piper Cub plane, which had been traveling south, apparently collided with the power lines, became entangled and was suspended upside down on a guideline, according to the initial investigation, the <a href="https://www.scottcountymn.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=623">Scott County Sheriff’s office said</a>.</p>
      <p>The Sheriff’s office received a report about the crash, which took place south of Shakopee, Minn., at around 3:57 p.m.</p>
      <p>The power line was deactivated and the pilot, 65-year-old Shakopee resident Thomas Koskovich, was freed from the plane. Koskovich, the only person on board, was not hurt.</p>
      <p>Scott County Sheriff Luke Hennen said the situation could have turned out “much worse.”</p>
      <p>“We are grateful the pilot was able to walk away without any injuries,” Hennen said.</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident.</p>
