      <p>The new series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here has now begun and this year the show has secured one of, if not, THE biggest signing to date in the shape of Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>American star Caitlyn is on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">I'm A Celebrity lineup</a> for this year alongside the likes of Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, football legend Ian Wright and former Big Brother star turned radio DJ Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>The current <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-winner-odds-17262670">I'm A Celebrity odds</a> have Roman Kemp as favourite to win, but they're changing all the time and earlier this week Caitlyn herself was the hot tip to triumph.</p>
      <p>And given how well known she is 70-year-old Caitlyn has to be in with a shout too. But if you don't know who she is, here is a lowdown.</p>
      <h3>Who is Caitlyn Jenner?</h3>
      <p>Born Bruce Jenner, the athlete became a household name the world over after winning Gold in the Men’s Decathlon in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal.</p>
      <p>This led to Jenner being heralded "the world's greatest athlete." In the 1990s, Jenner married Kris Kardashian and then in the 00s was propelled back into the spotlight on the family's hit TV show Keeping Up With The Karadashians.</p>
      <p>In April 2015, following a split with Kris, Caitlyn announced that she was a trans woman, having experienced gender dysphoria since childhood.</p>

      <p>The news was made public with a now famous Vanity Fair cover shoot and in a candid TV interview with US host Diane Sawyer, Caitlyn said “I’m so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can’t wait for you to get to know her/me.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn went onto have her own show on E!, the same network that aired Keeping Up With the Kardashians, with I Am Cait running for two seasons.</p>
      <p>She has also appeared on the American series of I'm A Celebrity, although that was well over a decade ago.</p>
