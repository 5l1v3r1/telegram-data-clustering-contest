        <b>Irish internationals David McGoldrick, Enda Stevens and Callum Robinson were in the thick of a crazy game at Bramall Lane as Sheffield United and Manchester United drew 3-3.</b>
      </p>
      <p>From the off the home side looked the more comfortable and it was <a href="https://punditarena.com/features/oisinmcqueirns2758/deep-dive-sleek-stylish-mcgoldrick-focal-point-in-free-flowing-ireland/">McGoldrick</a> who almost gave them the lead as he searched for his first Premier League goal.</p>
      <p>John Lundstram’s strike from the edge of the area was well saved by David De Gea, but came out to Stevens who found his international teammate McGoldrick with a brilliant cross only for the Spaniard to react excellently and keep his effort out.</p>

      <p>They did however find the opener shortly after as Lys <a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1198658894358290433?s=20">Mousset</a> muscled the returning Phil Jones off the ball and found Lundstram in the box with his cross.</p>
      <p>The former Everton man’s shot was well saved again by De Gea only for John Fleck to follow the ball in and find the net with the rebound.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side struggled throughout the first half with their front three of Danny James, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial failing to have any real impact in the opening 45.</p>
      <p>It got worse for the away side in the second half and it was a brilliant bit of centre-forward play from McGoldrick as his run gave Mousset space as he was found by Fleck before curling the ball low and past De Gea into the net.</p>

      <p>United looked dead and buried, with Gary Neville even referring to their front three as “a joke” but they were sparked into life thanks to an unlikely source.</p>
      <p>19-year-old left-back Brandon Williams found himself in the area on the left and as the ball fell to him he fizzed a beautiful volley low and past Simon Moore.</p>
      <p>From there, Solskjaer’s men had their tails up and soon grabbed the equaliser from another youngster as Rashford’s brilliant cross found Mason Greenwood to slide home from close range.</p>

      <p>It was the most unlikely of comebacks given the first half, and it would get better for United thanks to some excellent link-up play between James and Martial with the French international finding Rashford free to slot in what looked to be the winner.</p>
      <p>There was yet more drama to come and two Irish internationals were again involved as Stevens found the substitute Callum Robinson whose ball into the box was met by Oli McBurnie who, despite a VAR check for handball, found the equaliser in the dying minutes.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United move up to sixth thanks to the point while Manchester United go ninth.</p>
