      <h1>Scotland Yard urged to explain why Prince Andrew complaint was not subject to a full investigation </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:14:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/martin-evans/" target="_blank">Martin Evans</a></address>
      <p>Scotland Yard is coming under increasing pressure to explain why it failed to carry out a full investigation into allegations that a teenager had been trafficked to the UK to have sex with the Duke of York.</p>
      <p>Four years ago the Metropolitan Police received a complaint alleging that in 2001, 17-year-old, Virgina Roberts-Giuffre, was flown to London by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and coerced into having sex with the Duke.</p>
      <p>It was claimed the incident took place at the Kensington town house of Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of the Duke, and a photograph appeared to show him with his arm around Ms Roberts-Giuffre, while Miss Maxwell looked on in the background.</p>
      <p>But after assessing the initial complaint Scotland Yard decided the matter did not warrant a full blown investigation by detectives.</p>
      <p>A statement issued at the time said: “[We] can confirm that the Metropolitan Police Service [MPS] received an allegation of non-recent trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p>“The MPS reviewed the available evidence and the decision was made that this would not progress to a full investigation. As such, the matter was closed.”</p>
      <p>The Duke denies having sex with Roberts and insists he knew nothing of Epstein's activities.  </p>

      <p>But victims rights campaigners have questioned why the matter was not fully probed, especially given that in 2015, the Met was adhering to a national policy, stipulating that "victims must be believed".</p>
      <p>The policy was introduced by the College of Policing in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal and was intended to ensure that all complaints of sexual abuse were taken seriously and investigated thoroughly.</p>
      <p>Such was the Met's determination to pursue the policy to the letter that they spent 18 months and more than £4 million looking into complaints by fantasist, Carl Beech, who told police he had been raped and abused by a string of politicians and high profile figures in the 1970s and 80s.</p>
      <p>As a result of his extraordinary false<b> </b>allegations, Operation Midland was launched and Scotland Yard detectives raided the homes of Lord Brittan, the former Home Secretary, Lord Bramall, the former head of the army and Harvey Proctor the former Tory MP.</p>
      <p>The Telegraph understands the decision to shelve the Miss Roberts-Giuffre complaint, was taken by Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, who in 2015, was the commander in charge of specialist crime investigations.</p>

      <p>Mr Haydon was reporting to Assistant Commissioner Pat Gallan, who was also overseeing Operation Midland at the time.</p>
      <p>Campaigners have expressed concern about the seemingly different approaches taken in the two cases, but the Met has so far declined to explain why the complaint relating to Ms Roberts-Giuffre was not taken further.</p>
      <p>Repeated questions to Scotland Yard about the decision making process have been met with silence.</p>
      <p>Dame Vera Baird QC, the Victims’ Commissioner, is understood to have demanded an explanation from Scotland Yard, although she declined to comment directly because of the rules around election purdah.</p>
      <p>But victims’ rights campaigner, Harry Fletcher, said the Met needed to be fully transparent about what had happened with the 2015 complaint.</p>
      <p>He said: "There appears to be some worrying double standards here in terms of how Scotland Yard approached two complaints of historic sexual abuse. </p>
      <p>“In one case a complaint from a vulnerable young woman has been dismissed without further investigation, while at around the same time the Met was going all out to investigate a pack of lies from a fantasist.</p>
      <p>"It is only right that the Met now explains why there was such a divergence in their approach to these two cases so that the public can be confident that the decision had nothing to do with the identity of the person the complaints were against.”</p>
      <p>Claire Waxman, London’s Victims Commissioner, added: “It is vital that victims have confidence in the Met, particularly that decisions have been made fairly.</p>
      <p>"The right of victims to have police decisions reviewed plays an important role in achieving this.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile it has emerged that the Duke held a meeting with Miss Maxwell in Buckingham Palace in the summer, just a fortnight after Epstein was placed under investigation by US authorities on fresh sex trafficking allegations.</p>
      <p>In the Duke’s now infamous car crash television interview, he admitted seeing Miss Maxwell in the summer but insisted they had not discussed Epstein.</p>
      <p>But sources have now revealed that the meeting took place in the Duke’s private quarters inside Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>It was reported that Miss Maxwell arrived at the palace with four other smartly dressed people, who were possibly her legal team.</p>
      <p>The US authorities are understood to be keen to trace Miss Maxwell, who has been accused of helping to procure young girls for Epstein.</p>
