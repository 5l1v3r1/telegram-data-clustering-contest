      <p>All Elite Wrestling Superstar <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kenny-omega">Kenny Omega</a> recently sat down for an interview with Jim Valley and Dave Meltzer as part of the latest edition of <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/">The Wrestling Observer</a>. During the conversation, the former IWGP Heavyweight Champion finally opened up on his recent losing streak in AEW.</p>
      <h3>Kenny Omega talks about his recent losing streak in AEW</h3>
      <p>Ever since the inauguration of All Elite Wrestling, Kenny Omega has already suffered major losses to the likes of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, PAC, and very recently suffered a gruesome defeat at the hands of Jon Moxley at Full Gear.</p>
      <p>Having compiled an overall record of 6-4, Omega has finally broken into the weekly AEW rankings as he sits at #5 in the men's singles division and in his recent conversation with The Wrestling Observer, the former leader of the Bullet Club stated that he isn't willing to take a back seat and is always looking forward to contributing as much as he can. (H/T: <a href="https://www.sescoops.com/kenny-omega-explains-recent-losing-streak">SEScoops</a>)</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s no secret that I’ve sort of opted – I wouldn’t say ‘take a back seat’ – I love performing, I love being on every show as much as I can, I like to contribute, I always want to contribute where I can."</blockquote>
      <p>Omega further added that he is a very patient guy and knows for a fact that his time in AEW will eventually come.</p>
      <blockquote>“But we have so many new faces and each and every one of them that we have on our roster there’s a star, there is star quality. It’s unfortunate that not every single one of them can be on TV and they can’t get a crap tonne of time and I’m just a very patient guy. I know my time will come.”</blockquote>
      <h3>What's next for Kenny Omega?</h3>
      <p>Kenny Omega is currently scheduled to face PAC in a rematch on next week's episode of AEW Dynamite.</p>
