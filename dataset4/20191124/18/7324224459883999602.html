      <p>People of all ages lined up on Marquis Drive ready for Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate Amanda Milling to sound the air horn and start the race on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The event regularly raises about £3,000 for the Rotary Club, and proceeds will be split between the Midlands Air Ambulance and other charities.</p>
      <p>Secretary Harold Bould said: "We have about 90 people pre-registered and about 50 turn up on the day.</p>
      <p>"Half of the money raised today goes to the Midlands Air Ambulance and the other half goes to other charities.</p>
      <p>"We give some money to people to help with fuel costs, clothes to the homeless and a goodie bag to families too.</p>
      <p>"We easily raise £3,000 from the 10k each year.</p>
      <p>"This is classed as a very demanding course, it's very hilly."</p>
      <p>And Brian Riley, Rotary district governor, said members of a number of Rotary Clubs from across the West Midlands had come to help out.</p>
      <p>He said: "We have members from Burntwood, Aldridge, Walsall, it's a community activity and a good fun day and all for good causes."</p>
      <p>One runner was feeling nervous about choosing the course for her first race after three years out due to injury.</p>
      <p>Hazel Smallman, 56, has previously run it in 2015 and 2016.</p>
      <p>The City of Wolverhampton College worker said: "When I was driving here I was nervous seeing all the hills, but I have enjoyed it in the past, it's a lovely course."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile trio Stewart Barnes from Lichfield, Phil Lawford from Stafford and Richard Harris from Great Barr were taking it on for the first time.</p>
      <p>Stewart, 53, said: "We're planning to stick together, until we get competitive.</p>
      <p>"We're aiming to complete it in about the hour mark."</p>
      <p>Phil, 48, added: "It's another medal to the collection."</p>
      <p>And 23-year-old Megan Connor from Hednesford had only tackled one 10k before but decided last minute to join in.</p>
      <p>The chef said: "I drive part of the course to get to work so I thought I'd join in.</p>
      <p>"I did Stafford 10k in September, that was my first and I enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"I like the camaraderie, everyone gets a cheer and supported, it doesn't matter if you have someone waiting for you at the finish line."</p>
