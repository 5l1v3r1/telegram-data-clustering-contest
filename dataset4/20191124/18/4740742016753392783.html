      <h1>Bristol Bears links to former Ireland skipper Rory Best are wide of the mark</h1>
      <h2>Pat Lam's side claimed to have made contract offer to ex-Ulster hooker.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:54:26+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor, John Evely</a></address>
      <p>Reports stating that the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> have made a move for former Ireland skipper Rory Best are not accurate.</p>
      <p>On Sunday a story emerged linking the 37-year-old with a short-term deal until the end of the season, but <i>Bristol Live</i> understands that the story is untrue.</p>
      <p>Best retired from international rugby following the 2019 World Cup, and is due to retire from all forms of the game following playing against Wales with the Barbarians next weekend.</p>
      <p>A contract offer from the current Premiership leaders was said to have swayed Best's intentions, but according to our sources, no offer has been made.</p>

      <p>We understand that <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> have not ruled out the possibility of adding front row reinforcements with Shaun Malton injured with a neck issue which is being assessed week by week, but the club still have first choice Harry Thacker, Tom Lindsay and exciting senior academy duo Will Capon and George Kloska available for selection.</p>
      <p>England U20s hooker Capon, now 20, is playing an increasingly prominent role at the club and scored off the bench in the 0-36 victory over Brive in the European Challenge Cup on Friday.</p>
      <p>While director of rugby Pat Lam has previously invested in older players such as back rower George Smith and prop John Afoa, Best will not be pitching up at Ashton Gate any time soon.</p>
      <p>The Bears <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/it-went-exactly-plan-pat-3572692">beat Brive on Friday night</a> to continue their fine start to the season and are now preparing to face London Irish a week today in the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
