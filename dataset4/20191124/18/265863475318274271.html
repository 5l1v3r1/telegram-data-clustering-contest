Schulz, Charlie Brown hosts Thanksgiving dinner for his friends but runs into another anxiety-filled crisis as Snoopy and Woodstock were left in charge of preparing the feast.</p>
      <p>Following<i> A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving</i> will be another Peanuts’ special called  <i>This Is America, Charlie Brown: The Mayflower Voyagers.</i></p>

      <p>On Thursday, December 5, 2019, ABC will air the holiday classic <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas.</i> The movie first debuted in 1965 and is one of the only Christmas specials that continues to recite the Bible account of Jesus Christ’s birthday shown on secular television.  ABC released a statement about the movie’s storyline.</p>
      <blockquote>“Charlie Brown complains about the overwhelming materialism that he sees everywhere during the Christmas season. Lucy suggests that he become director of the school Christmas pageant, and Charlie Brown accepts, but it proves to be a frustrating struggle. When an attempt to restore the proper spirit with a forlorn little fir Christmas tree fails, Charlie Brown needs Linus’ help to learn what the real meaning of Christmas is.”</blockquote>
      <p>As the special is only half-an-hour long, ABC is going to follow <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> with the special<i> Charlie Brown’s Christmas Tales.</i></p>
      <p>In <i>Charlie Brown’s Christmas Tales</i>, each beloved character from the Peanuts’ gallery will present their own Christmas stories in vignettes.</p>
      <p>Are you a fan of <i>A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving </i>and <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>? How do you feel about the Gospel story being told in A Charlie Brown Christmas? Does that make you more inclined to watch the program or will you not tune in because of the Christian message?</p>
