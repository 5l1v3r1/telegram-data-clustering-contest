      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/maratha-arabians">Maratha Arabians</a> crushed the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/deccan-gladiators-cricket">Deccan Gladiators</a> in the final of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/t10-cricket-league">Abu Dhabi T10 League</a> 2019 to emerge as the winners of the tournament. Chadwick Walton and Dwayne Bravo starred for the Arabians as they won the match by 8 wickets.</p>
      <p>The champions had won the toss and elected to bowl first at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. Mitchell McClenaghan (1/12) struck for the Arabians in the first over itself as he removed the dangerous Shane Watson (1). Lasith Malinga (1/18) got the better of Mohammad Shahzad (14) in the next over as both the Deccan openers were back in the hut in the mandatory powerplay.</p>
      <p>Daniel Lawrence (4) and Kieron Pollard (5) tried their best to get going in the middle however, Bravo (2/16) and Kasun Rajitha (1/15) claimed their wickets, respectively.</p>

      <p>The Gladiators' innings finally took off in the second half as Bhanuka Rajapaksa (23) and Asif Ali (25*) built a good partnership. Ben Cutting (12) played a quick cameo but three successive run-outs on the last three balls of the innings kept the Gladiators down to 87/8.</p>
      <p>Chasing a modest target of 88 runs, the Maratha Arabians got off to a flier as Walton (51*) scored a half-century. Chris Lynn (16) hit two sixes in his brief knock while Adam Lyth (2) could not contribute much to the team's score.</p>
      <p>Najibullah Zadran (12*) and Walton guided the Arabians home with 2.4 overs to spare. The Afghan batsman finished off the chase in style with a six. Migael Pretorious (1/16) and Zahoor Khan (1/22) were the only Deccan bowlers who created some troubles for their opponents.</p>
