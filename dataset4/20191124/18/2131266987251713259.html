        <b>Ministers were warned pregnant women would be at risk due to the distance they would have to travel for maternity services in Lumsden, Newshub can reveal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now the Government is being urged to apologise over the handling of the Lumsden Maternity Centre downgrade. </p>
      <p>The Southland town's birthing centre was downgraded in April, but since then many have voiced concerns over maternity services in the area. </p>

      </p>
      <p>In August, MPs voted not to reinstate the centre, despite acknowledging there were issues with the downgrade. A committee rejected a petition by Clutha-Southland MP Hamish Walker to reinstate full services at the centre.</p>
      <p>But Newshub can reveal ministers were warned pregnant women would be at risk due to the distance they would have to travel.</p>
      <p>"The fact is they haven't followed their own Ministry of Health advice - this is disgraceful," Walker told Newshub.</p>
      <p>"Five mothers gave birth without making it to a primary birthing unit. That's because the Government has treated Southland people like second-class citizens."</p>
      <p>He says it shows incompetence by the Government.</p>
      <p>"This is an absolute train wreck, it has been all along. The Health Minister and the DHB need to give the community a pretty big apology."</p>
      <p>Health Minister David Clark declined to comment. </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a report compiled by Ernst and Young gave a damning assessment of Southland's maternity hubs. The report criticised the "informal" management processes and said that there was an "inconsistent delivery of service".</p>
