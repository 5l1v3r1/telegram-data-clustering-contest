      <h1>Daylesford burglaries: Shepherds Flat man pleads guilty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Erin Williams</a></address>
      <p>A Shepherds Flat man has pleaded guilty to burglaring three properties more than 10 years ago despite not remembering the offending.</p>
      <p>Simon Frazer, 49, burgled the properties at Korweinguboora in September 2006 and Hepburn Springs in November 2008, leaving traces of his blood behind.</p>
      <p>The Ballarat Magistrates Court was told on Thursday Frazer stole $800 worth of property during the Korweinguboora burglary and $7300 worth of items from two Hepburn Springs units.</p>
      <p>The stolen items, which included two televisions, a DVD player and washing machine, have never been recovered.</p>
      <p>Police prosecutor Senior Constable Simon Pearce said on July 11, 2019, Frazer was at the Royal Hotel playing pool when he stole a bank card from the victim's leather jacket pocket.</p>
      <p>He said the card was used to buy a taxi fare and more than $100 worth of items from the Coles supermarket in two transactions.</p>
      <p>Frazer could not recall the incident because he was drunk, while the burglaries had also been erased from his memory.</p>
      <p>He sought a sentenced indication on three counts of burglary and one count of obtaining property by deception.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer McClennan said the sudden death of his client's wife lead to Frazer's anxiety and depression that were largely untreated.</p>
      <p>He said Frazer had a long-standing cannabis addiction where he smoked half-a-gram a day, but he was now free of the drug.</p>
      <p>Mr McClennan said Frazer was seeking a sentence indication because the burglaries occurred more than 10 years ago and he could not remember them but he wanted the matter finalised.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Michelle Mykytowycz said Frazer would have received immediate imprisonment on the burglary charges 10 years ago but she was prepared to hand him a non-custodial sentence.</p>
      <p>"These are serious burglaries, home burglaries with high value items stole. There really needs to be general deterrence," Ms Mykytowycz said.</p>
      <p>He accepted the indication and pleaded guilty to the offences, including breaching a community correction order.</p>
      <p>"Domestic burglaries are very serious. People should feel safe in their house," Ms Mykytowycz said.</p>
      <p>"When someone breaks into a house and steals items, it breaches safety and people really should feel safe in their homes."</p>
      <p>Frazer was sentenced to a community correction order with a work component only of 70 hours of community work.</p>
      <p>His previous CCO was varied to restart on Thursday for 12 months.</p>
