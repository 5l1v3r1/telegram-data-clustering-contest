      <p>Tributes have been paid to prominent businessman Norman Lynas, who has died aged 77.</p>
      <p>Mr Lynas, who was awarded an OBE for services to business, the community and charity, died on Saturday following a short illness.</p>
      <p>He began his career with a small fishmongers shop in Coleraine before growing a major frozen food firm, Lynas Foodservice.</p>
      <p>It employs 550 staff and serves more than 5,000 customers.</p>
      <p>Mr Lynas established the Lynas Charitable Trust Fund in 1978 from income from the business, and supported a wide variety of causes.</p>
      <p>With his wife Lynda, he set up Exodus in 1997, a youth disciple organisation for young Christians.</p>
      <p>His son Peter, director of Evangelical Alliance, said his father "leaves a living legacy in the many lives he touched and the impact he had for Jesus and the kingdom".</p>
      <p>Another of his sons, Andrew, chief executive of Lynas Foodservice, described his father as "a man of vision, guts and tenacity who loved Jesus and loved business".</p>
      <p>A service of thanksgiving will take place on Wednesday November 27 at Portstewart Baptist church.</p>
