      <p>This shocking footage shows the moment a speeding car smashes against the side of a flyover and plummets into a group of people.</p>
      <p>One woman has been killed and six others injured in the crash in Hyderabad, southern India.</p>
      <p>CCTV images show the red Volkswagen losing control and flying over the safety barrier onto a small crowd in the road below.</p>
      <p>The first impact appears to miss them by inches thanks to some quick reactions, but the wreck bounces and catches up with some of the fleeing victims.</p>

      <p>The six people who were injured have been rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>The woman who died was waiting for an auto rickshaw with her daughter while the driver survived after their airbag was activated, according to Indian broadcaster NDTV.</p>
      <p>The one-way ‘Biodiversity Flyover’ was opened earlier this month in the city’s tech hub at a cost of 700 million rupees (£7.6 million), NDTV added.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said it will be closed for evaluation and said the family of the woman who died will be compensated.</p>
      <p>Local police believe the car was travelling at more than 100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) on a road with a 40 kph (25 mph) speed limit.</p>
