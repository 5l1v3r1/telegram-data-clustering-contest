        <b>Rapman has broken his silence about the brawl that took place at a Birmingham cinema this weekend, prompting Vue Cinemas to ban all screenings of his new movie Blue Story.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/cinema-lockdown-gang-machetes-brawl-assault-police-officers-11207932/">A fight broke out at the Star City complex</a> in the Nechells area of Birmingham on Saturday while cinema-goers sat down to watch Rapman’s critically-acclaimed movie.</p>
      <p>Reports emerged of a gang arriving at the Vue cinema armed with machetes prompting armed police to descend on the complex.</p>
      <p>It was then revealed the Vue Cinemas decided to ban Blue Story following the incident.</p>
      <p>Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, reacted to the brawl with a statement on Twitter which said: ‘Sending love to all those involved in yesterday’s violence at Star City in Birmingham. It’s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody.</p>
      <p>‘Bluestory is a film about love not violence.’</p>

      <p>Alluding to the cinema ban, the filmmaker continued: ‘There were also a few incidents earlier this year with the release of The Joker, it’s always unfortunate, but I hope that the blame is placed with the individuals and not an indictment of the film itself.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.’</p>
      <p>Rapman wrote and directed Blue Story, which centers on two friends who become rivals after getting caught up in a London gangland war. It stars Top Boy actor Micheal Ward and former EastEnders star Khali Best.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Vue Cinemas has since confirmed to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film.</p>

      <p>‘The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority.</p>
      <p>‘We are saddened to have had to take this step, which is not made lightly, particularly as the film itself seeks to strike a strong message against violence.’</p>
      <p>According <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/exclusive-vue-bans-blue-story-17307755">to Birmingham Live</a>, a recorded message on Vue Cinemas answerphone said: ‘We regret that we will no longer be screening the film Blue Story at any of our venues.</p>
