      <h1>Dreich is too wishy-washy to be the most iconic Scots-language word</h1>
      <h2>You may have read this week that The Scottish Book Trust declared “dreich” to be the most iconic Scots word. I disagree entirely.</h2>

      <p>However, let us start with a short discussion of Scots-English.</p>
      <p>I enjoy hearing it spoken. By my understanding of history, Scots is one of the branches that grew from the Germanic languages of migrating tribes like the Jutes and Angles.</p>
      <p>Since those invasions a standard English language, owned by everyone on this island, has evolved. It is that commonly understood, widely used English that I enjoy and value.</p>
      <p>But I also use Scots words. I treasure terms like scouk, shevel, shoogle, footer, and lucken. They are wonderfully expressive.</p>
      <p>An entire sentence of Scots, however, is difficult to read. I struggle with the apologetic apostrophes that are sometimes sprinkled on wi’ (us) wi’ (with) wa’ (with), wa’ (wall), etc. Sentences don’t look right with the apostrophes — or without them. My attention wanders from the intended message to the point where I’m just trying to work out what, if anything, is missing from the words.</p>
      <p>But English could certainly benefit from a wider adoption of our vividly pictorial Scots nouns, verbs and adjectives. Which brings me back to dreich.</p>
      <p>It is, of course, a great word. I can see why it rated highly in the SBT’s poll (a part of the hugely interesting Book Week Scotland). But while dreich is a delicious word, it’s surely not the most iconic Scottish word.</p>
      <p>The Scottish accent is at its best when used in an animated way. It is suited to argument, it is ideal when you wish to express vehemence, humour, aggression, or fire insults. It is a language that demands to be heard.</p>
      <p>You can put real bite into the syllables. You can inject full-bodied feeling. All those hard-rolled Rs and glottal stops hold a granite poetry, with thistle thorns for punctuation. They evoke a flavour of tenement-lined streets and football terraces.</p>
      <p>The best Scots word of all shouldn’t be one that describes misty glens and the Scotland you only ever see on shortbread tins or calendar photos for the month of October. A soft, gentle word like dreich can’t be our country’s single most defining term.</p>
      <p>Glaikit and scunnered came second and third on the list. They are truly iconic Scots words. Hackit should have been on there too. And clarty, nippit, bauchle, dunderheid, vauntie, clipe, bowfin, feartie, midden and even whigmaleerie.</p>
      <p>The sharp edges of these words cut their way to being regarded as iconic.</p>

      <h3>Word of the week</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Vauntie (adjective)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scots for proud, boastful, vain. EG: “I’ve always thought that Prince Andrew carries himself like a vauntie man.”</p>
