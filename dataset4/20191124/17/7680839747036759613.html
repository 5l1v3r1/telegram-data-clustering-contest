      <p>The US wants to ink a trade deal with China by the end of 2019, but can’t overlook violence in Hong Kong, the head of the National Security Agency has said.</p>
      <p>“We were hoping to have deal done by the end of the year. I still think that’s possible,” Robert O’Brien said <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china/still-hope-for-u-s-china-deal-this-year-u-s-official-idUKKBN1XX0L6">during a security conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, we’re not going to turn a blind eye to what’s happening in Hong Kong or what’s happening in the South China Sea, or other areas of the world where we’re concerned about China’s activity.”</p>
      <p>O’Brien, Donald Trump’s fourth security advisor, said it “would be a good sign” if Sunday’s local elections in Hong Kong passed without clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-interview-transcript-trump-interviewed-after-impeachment-hearings">Fox &amp; Friends</a> on Friday, Trump said that if it weren’t for him, “Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes.”</p>
      <p>He said that Xi had “a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren’t going in only because I asked him, ‘please don’t do that.'”</p>

      <p>Trump also said he could veto bipartisan US legislation, passed on Wednesday, that outlined support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, suggesting it will anger China and derail trade talks.</p>
      <p>“We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi. He’s a friend of mine, an incredible guy.”</p>
