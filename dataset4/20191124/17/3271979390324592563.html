      <p><b>Jennifer Aniston </b>and Reese Witherspoon’s new TV series <i>The Morning Show </i>is Apple’s first big step into the streaming wars. There have been a lot of false rumors surrounding the show and its lead actresses. In particular, <b>Gossip Cop </b>has had to bust several rumors about the two stars’ on and off-set relationship. Here are just a few of those made-up stories we busted.</p>
      <p>Even before the show was released, <i>In Touch</i> was quick to accuse <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoon-morning-show-poster/">Aniston of being jealous of Witherspoon’s appearance in the show’s promotional materials</a>. In one of its October issues, the tabloid claimed Aniston felt her co-star looked too attractive on the poster for the show — and it was making her look worse. An anonymous source said Aniston thought the poster made Witherspoon look “natural and pretty,” but made her own face look “rounder, definitely fuller and even rubbery.”</p>
      <p>Like most tabloid stories, it was based entirely off the word of an unidentifiable “source.” <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with Aniston’s spokesperson, who told us on the record that it was false. The actress had no issue with the design of the poster. As we pointed out at the time, Aniston is an executive producer and star of the show, so she was likely involved in the advertising process. If she truly had an issue with the design, she would’ve done something about it before it was released.</p>
      <p>Later that month, <i>In Touch</i> published a phony piece claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoon-morning-show-jealous/">Aniston thought Witherspoon was “stealing” her spotlight</a>. According to another anonymous “insider,” Witherspoon “steals the show,” which upset Aniston because she believes she’s the bigger star. The source lays out the trajectory of both of their careers before coming to the conclusion that Aniston “can’t help but compare and despair” in the face of Witherspoon’s talents and accomplishments.</p>
      <p>In reality, however, the two are very close friends and there’s no jealousy or competition between them. Aniston and Witherspoon have exchanged jokes and compliments multiple times on social media, and they’ve gushed about one another in interviews. The two even coordinated their outfits when they appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i> together.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <i>OK!</i> alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoon-morning-show-bad-reviews/">Aniston and Witherspoon were blaming each other for the show’s underwhelming reviews</a>. A mysterious source said the two were “both incredibly embarrassed and upset” after several critics gave the show a mediocre rating. This supposedly led to the two “playing the blame game,” with Aniston criticizing some of Witherspoon’s early choices about the show and Witherspoon believing it would have benefited from a “more critically acclaimed” co-star. The end result was an ugly stalemate that had “both regret getting involved” with the show.</p>
      <p>However, <i>The Morning Show</i> received its fair share of positive reviews from a variety of highly respected outlets. In fact, it still holds a 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Considering the fact that the show has been renewed for a second season, we think it’s safe to say that the two don’t regret anything. Of course, that second season will most likely bring up just as much gossip as the first season, but <b>Gossip Cop</b> will stay vigilant.</p>
