      <p>Whether or not they should be, Browns fans are having a fiesta with the Cleveland-Pittsburgh brawl story.</p>
      <p>A few days after the NFL's indefinite suspension ofBrowns defensive end Myles Garrett<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-swing-helmet-mason-rudolph-browns-steelers/l75bap6hzav11a97g48czjl1p">for his role in last week's fight</a> was upheld, some of the Cleveland faithful were filmed swinging a Steelers helmet at a Mason Rudolph piñata before their team's Week 13 home game against the Dolphins.</p>
      <p>Seriously. Cleveland.com shared the video Sunday morning.</p>

      <p>Rudolph, of course, was Garrett's target when the Browns DE took off the Steelers QB's helmet and swung on (and connected with) his opponent's head. Rudolph was not suspended for his role in the end-of-game brawl, but he was fined $50,000.</p>

        <b>MORE STEELERS VS BROWNS:<br/><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-brawl-suspensions-fines-list-myles-garrett-mason-rudolph/67ic8xzy878h15fp3hij8ka4o">A complete list of suspensions and fines</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to fining 33 players for their roles in the fight, the NFL issued $250,000 fines to both the Steelers and the Browns, who will meet again next week in Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>During his appeal hearing with the NFL on Wednesday, Garrett <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-mason-rudolph-browns-steelers-brawl/cvj7kgdhkncm18mv7px1sdznd">claimed</a> Rudolph called him a racial slur right before the fight broke out, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter and Josina Anderson. An NFL spokersperson said the league looked into Garrett's allegation but "found no such evidence" Rudolph uttered a racial slur, per Schefter.</p>
      <p>Rudolph on Wednesdayaccepted responsibility for not keeping his composure but made it clear he "definitely didn't say anything" to anger Garrett to the point that he would rip off Rudolph's helmet and use it as a weapon against Rudolph. The next day, Rudolph denied Garrett's allegation of a racial slurthrough a Steelers spokesperson, who said Rudolph "will not discuss this accusation any further" and added "his focus remains on preparation for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals."</p>
      <p>Browns general manager John Dorsey did not address Garrett's allegation in <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-mason-rudolph-racial-slur-browns-steelers/1wdwnom9q5wew1ubau4pivcywd">a statement</a> the team issued Thursday night.</p>
